0:00:15.73,000 --> 0:00:17,000
As an architect, I often ask myself,

3
0:00:18.179,000 --> 0:00:2,000
what is the origin of the forms that we design?

4
0:00:21.019,000 --> 0:00:23,000
What kind of forms could we design

5
0:00:23.924,000 --> 0:00:25,000
if we wouldn't work with references anymore?

6
0:00:26.747,000 --> 0:00:29,000
If we had no bias, if we had no preconceptions,

7
0:00:30.132,000 --> 0:00:32,000
what kind of forms could we design

8
0:00:32.339,000 --> 0:00:33,000
if we could free ourselves from

9
0:00:33.939,000 --> 0:00:35,000
our experience?

10
0:00:36.075,000 --> 0:00:4,000
If we could free ourselves from our education?

11
0:00:40.809,000 --> 0:00:43,000
What would these unseen forms look like?

12
0:00:43.836,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Would they surprise us? Would they intrigue us?

13
0:00:47.547,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Would they delight us?

14
0:00:49.962,000 --> 0:00:52,000
If so, then how can we go about creating something that is truly new?

15
0:00:53.883,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I propose we look to nature.

16
0:00:56.275,000 --> 0:01:,000
Nature has been called the greatest architect of forms.

17
0:01:00.539,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And I'm not saying that we should copy nature,

18
0:01:04.127,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I'm not saying we should mimic biology,

19
0:01:06.507,000 --> 0:01:09,000
instead I propose that we can borrow nature's processes.

20
0:01:09.955,000 --> 0:01:13,000
We can abstract them and to create something that is new.

21
0:01:14.409,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Nature's main process of creation, morphogenesis,

22
0:01:18.287,000 --> 0:01:21,000
is the splitting of one cell into two cells.

23
0:01:22.116,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And these cells can either be identical,

24
0:01:24.173,000 --> 0:01:26,000
or they can be distinct from each other

25
0:01:26.348,000 --> 0:01:28,000
through asymmetric cell division.

26
0:01:28.412,000 --> 0:01:31,000
If we abstract this process, and simplify it as much as possible,

27
0:01:32.211,000 --> 0:01:34,000
then we could start with a single sheet of paper,

28
0:01:34.444,000 --> 0:01:36,000
one surface, and we could make a fold

29
0:01:36.94,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and divide the surface into two surfaces.

30
0:01:39.876,000 --> 0:01:41,000
We're free to choose where we make the fold.

31
0:01:42.139,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And by doing so, we can differentiate the surfaces.

32
0:01:47.049,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Through this very simple process,

33
0:01:48.943,000 --> 0:01:51,000
we can create an astounding variety of forms.

34
0:01:52.555,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Now, we can take this form and use the same process

35
0:01:55.28,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to generate three-dimensional structures,

36
0:01:57.272,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but rather than folding things by hand,

37
0:01:59.68,000 --> 0:02:01,000
we'll bring the structure into the computer,

38
0:02:02.265,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and code it as an algorithm.

39
0:02:05.24,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And in doing so, we can suddenly fold anything.

40
0:02:08.248,000 --> 0:02:1,000
We can fold a million times faster,

41
0:02:10.407,000 --> 0:02:13,000
we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations.

42
0:02:13.568,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And as we're seeking to make something three-dimensional,

43
0:02:16.048,000 --> 0:02:19,000
we start not with a single surface, but with a volume.

44
0:02:19.264,000 --> 0:02:2,000
A simple volume, the cube.

45
0:02:20.617,000 --> 0:02:21,000
If we take its surfaces and fold them

46
0:02:22.337,000 --> 0:02:24,000
again and again and again and again,

47
0:02:24.393,000 --> 0:02:26,000
then after 16 iterations, 16 steps,

48
0:02:27.256,000 --> 0:02:3,000
we end up with 400,000 surfaces and a shape that looks,

49
0:02:31.105,000 --> 0:02:33,000
for instance, like this.

50
0:02:33.64,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And if we change where we make the folds,

51
0:02:36.352,000 --> 0:02:37,000
if we change the folding ratio,

52
0:02:37.993,000 --> 0:02:4,000
then this cube turns into this one.

53
0:02:41.416,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape,

54
0:02:45.555,000 --> 0:02:46,000
or this shape.

55
0:02:47.382,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So we exert control over the form

56
0:02:49.005,000 --> 0:02:52,000
by specifying the position of where we're making the fold,

57
0:02:52.509,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but essentially you're looking at a folded cube.

58
0:02:57.215,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And we can play with this.

59
0:02:58.279,000 --> 0:03:,000
We can apply different folding ratios to different parts

60
0:03:00.895,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of the form to create local conditions.

61
0:03:03.64,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We can begin to sculpt the form.

62
0:03:05.583,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And because we're doing the folding on the computer,

63
0:03:08.471,000 --> 0:03:11,000
we are completely free of any physical constraints.

64
0:03:12.167,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So that means that surfaces can intersect themselves,

65
0:03:15.118,000 --> 0:03:16,000
they can become impossibly small.

66
0:03:16.607,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We can make folds that we otherwise could not make.

67
0:03:20.208,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Surfaces can become porous.

68
0:03:22.086,000 --> 0:03:24,000
They can stretch. They can tear.

69
0:03:24.815,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce.

70
0:03:29.45,000 --> 0:03:31,000
But in each case, I didn't design the form.

71
0:03:32.2,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I designed the process that generated the form.

72
0:03:36.801,000 --> 0:03:4,000
In general, if we make a small change to the folding ratio,

73
0:03:41.289,000 --> 0:03:42,000
which is what you're seeing here,

74
0:03:42.884,000 --> 0:03:45,000
then the form changes correspondingly.

75
0:03:46.657,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But that's only half of the story --

76
0:03:48.913,000 --> 0:03:52,000
99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this,

77
0:03:53.236,000 --> 0:03:57,000
but this, the geometric equivalent of noise.

78
0:03:58.132,000 --> 0:04:,000
The forms that I showed before were made actually

79
0:04:00.252,000 --> 0:04:01,000
through very long trial and error.

80
0:04:01.9,000 --> 0:04:04,000
A far more effective way to create forms, I have found,

81
0:04:05.116,000 --> 0:04:08,000
is to use information that is already contained in forms.

82
0:04:09.004,000 --> 0:04:11,000
A very simple form such as this one actually contains

83
0:04:11.659,000 --> 0:04:14,000
a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye.

84
0:04:15.251,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So, for instance, we can plot the length of the edges.

85
0:04:17.732,000 --> 0:04:2,000
White surfaces have long edges, black ones have short ones.

86
0:04:21.068,000 --> 0:04:24,000
We can plot the planarity of the surfaces, their curvature,

87
0:04:24.645,000 --> 0:04:28,000
how radial they are -- all information that may not be

88
0:04:28.732,000 --> 0:04:29,000
instantly visible to you,

89
0:04:30.679,000 --> 0:04:32,000
but that we can bring out, that we can articulate,

90
0:04:33.104,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and that we can use to control the folding.

91
0:04:36.48,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So now I'm not specifying a single

92
0:04:38.439,000 --> 0:04:4,000
ratio anymore to fold it,

93
0:04:40.615,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but instead I'm establishing a rule,

94
0:04:43.167,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I'm establishing a link between a property of a surface

95
0:04:45.603,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and how that surface is folded.

96
0:04:48.576,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And because I've designed the process and not the form,

97
0:04:51.527,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I can run the process again and again and again

98
0:04:53.849,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to produce a whole family of forms.

99
0:05:08.645,000 --> 0:05:12,000
These forms look elaborate, but the process is a very minimal one.

100
0:05:13.088,000 --> 0:05:14,000
There is a simple input,

101
0:05:14.217,000 --> 0:05:15,000
it's always a cube that I start with,

102
0:05:16.169,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and it's a very simple operation -- it's making a fold,

103
0:05:19.745,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and doing this over and over again.

104
0:05:23.697,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So let's bring this process to architecture.

105
0:05:25.977,000 --> 0:05:26,000
How? And at what scale?

106
0:05:27.577,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I chose to design a column.

107
0:05:29.305,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Columns are architectural archetypes.

108
0:05:32.681,000 --> 0:05:35,000
They've been used throughout history to express ideals

109
0:05:35.748,000 --> 0:05:4,000
about beauty, about technology.

110
0:05:40.823,000 --> 0:05:41,000
A challenge to me was how we could express

111
0:05:42.745,000 --> 0:05:45,000
this new algorithmic order in a column.

112
0:05:46.041,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I started using four cylinders.

113
0:05:49.025,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Through a lot of experimentation, these cylinders

114
0:05:52.801,000 --> 0:05:55,000
eventually evolved into this.

115
0:05:55.936,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And these columns, they have information at very many scales.

116
0:06:00.552,000 --> 0:06:02,000
We can begin to zoom into them.

117
0:06:03.07,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The closer one gets, the more new features one discovers.

118
0:06:06.625,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility.

119
0:06:10.297,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And unlike traditional architecture,

120
0:06:12.249,000 --> 0:06:14,000
it's a single process that creates both the overall form

121
0:06:15.033,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and the microscopic surface detail.

122
0:06:20.378,000 --> 0:06:22,000
These forms are undrawable.

123
0:06:23.069,000 --> 0:06:26,000
An architect who's drawing them with a pen and a paper

124
0:06:26.445,000 --> 0:06:27,000
would probably take months,

125
0:06:28.237,000 --> 0:06:3,000
or it would take even a year to draw all the sections,

126
0:06:30.621,000 --> 0:06:32,000
all of the elevations, you can only create something like this

127
0:06:32.925,000 --> 0:06:34,000
through an algorithm.

128
0:06:35.061,000 --> 0:06:37,000
The more interesting question, perhaps, is,

129
0:06:37.093,000 --> 0:06:39,000
are these forms imaginable?

130
0:06:39.722,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Usually, an architect can somehow envision the end state

131
0:06:42.357,000 --> 0:06:43,000
of what he is designing.

132
0:06:44.221,000 --> 0:06:46,000
In this case, the process is deterministic.

133
0:06:47.046,000 --> 0:06:49,000
There's no randomness involved at all,

134
0:06:49.405,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but it's not entirely predictable.

135
0:06:51.412,000 --> 0:06:52,000
There's too many surfaces,

136
0:06:52.988,000 --> 0:06:55,000
there's too much detail, one can't see the end state.

137
0:06:56.598,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So this leads to a new role for the architect.

138
0:06:59.812,000 --> 0:07:02,000
One needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities

139
0:07:03.423,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that are out there.

140
0:07:05.199,000 --> 0:07:08,000
For one thing, one can design many variants of a form,

141
0:07:08.431,000 --> 0:07:1,000
in parallel, and one can cultivate them.

142
0:07:10.645,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And to go back to the analogy with nature,

143
0:07:12.893,000 --> 0:07:14,000
one can begin to think in terms of populations,

144
0:07:15.389,000 --> 0:07:18,000
one can talk about permutations, about generations,

145
0:07:18.917,000 --> 0:07:22,000
about crossing and breeding to come up with a design.

146
0:07:23.78,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And the architect is really, he moves into the position

147
0:07:26.165,000 --> 0:07:29,000
of being an orchestrator of all of these processes.

148
0:07:29.597,000 --> 0:07:31,000
But enough of the theory.

149
0:07:31.941,000 --> 0:07:33,000
At one point I simply wanted to jump inside

150
0:07:34.468,000 --> 0:07:37,000
this image, so to say, I bought these red and blue

151
0:07:38.297,000 --> 0:07:4,000
3D glasses, got up very close to the screen,

152
0:07:41.233,000 --> 0:07:43,000
but still that wasn't the same as being able to

153
0:07:43.305,000 --> 0:07:45,000
walk around and touch things.

154
0:07:45.657,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So there was only one possibility --

155
0:07:47.56,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to bring the column out of the computer.

156
0:07:50.657,000 --> 0:07:52,000
There's been a lot of talk now about 3D printing.

157
0:07:53.577,000 --> 0:07:55,000
For me, or for my purpose at this moment,

158
0:07:56.536,000 --> 0:07:59,000
there's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff

159
0:07:59.618,000 --> 0:08:05,000
between scale, on the one hand, and resolution and speed, on the other.

160
0:08:06.401,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So instead, we decided to take the column,

161
0:08:08.658,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and we decided to build it as a layered model,

162
0:08:11.097,000 --> 0:08:15,000
made out of very many slices, thinly stacked over each other.

163
0:08:15.225,000 --> 0:08:16,000
What you're looking at here is an X-ray

164
0:08:17.122,000 --> 0:08:19,000
of the column that you just saw, viewed from the top.

165
0:08:19.897,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Unbeknownst to me at the time,

166
0:08:21.897,000 --> 0:08:23,000
because we had only seen the outside,

167
0:08:24.273,000 --> 0:08:26,000
the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves,

168
0:08:26.433,000 --> 0:08:28,000
to grow on the inside of the column,

169
0:08:28.697,000 --> 0:08:3,000
which was quite a surprising discovery.

170
0:08:31.243,000 --> 0:08:34,000
From this shape, we calculated a cutting line,

171
0:08:34.857,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter

172
0:08:37.881,000 --> 0:08:4,000
to produce -- and you're seeing a segment of it here --

173
0:08:41.695,000 --> 0:08:45,000
very many thin slices, individually cut, on top of each other.

174
0:08:48.74,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And this is a photo now, it's not a rendering,

175
0:08:51.553,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and the column that we ended up with

176
0:08:53.353,000 --> 0:08:56,000
after a lot of work, ended up looking remarkably like the one

177
0:08:56.4,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that we had designed in the computer.

178
0:09:00.11,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Almost all of the details, almost all of the

179
0:09:02.231,000 --> 0:09:05,000
surface intricacies were preserved.

180
0:09:07.886,000 --> 0:09:09,000
But it was very labor intensive.

181
0:09:10.232,000 --> 0:09:12,000
There's a huge disconnect at the moment still

182
0:09:12.633,000 --> 0:09:14,000
between the virtual and the physical.

183
0:09:15.393,000 --> 0:09:17,000
It took me several months to design the column,

184
0:09:17.519,000 --> 0:09:19,000
but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds

185
0:09:20.237,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to calculate all of the 16 million faces.

186
0:09:23.085,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The physical model, on the other hand,

187
0:09:25.046,000 --> 0:09:29,000
is 2,700 layers, one millimeter thick,

188
0:09:29.254,000 --> 0:09:33,000
it weighs 700 kilos, it's made of sheet that can cover

189
0:09:33.401,000 --> 0:09:35,000
this entire auditorium.

190
0:09:35.539,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And the cutting path that the laser followed

191
0:09:37.627,000 --> 0:09:42,000
goes from here to the airport and back again.

192
0:09:42.744,000 --> 0:09:43,000
But it is increasingly possible.

193
0:09:44.493,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Machines are getting faster, it's getting less expensive,

194
0:09:47.104,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and there's some promising technological developments

195
0:09:49.864,000 --> 0:09:5,000
just on the horizon.

196
0:09:51.647,000 --> 0:09:54,000
These are images from the Gwangju Biennale.

197
0:09:54.719,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And in this case, I used ABS plastic to produce the columns,

198
0:09:58.243,000 --> 0:09:59,000
we used the bigger, faster machine,

199
0:10:00.097,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and they have a steel core inside, so they're structural,

200
0:10:03.154,000 --> 0:10:05,000
they can bear loads for once.

201
0:10:06.13,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns.

202
0:10:08.145,000 --> 0:10:11,000
You can see a different column in the mirror,

203
0:10:11.554,000 --> 0:10:13,000
if there's a mirror behind the column

204
0:10:13.604,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that creates a sort of an optical illusion.

205
0:10:16.691,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So where does this leave us?

206
0:10:18.522,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us

207
0:10:22.99,000 --> 0:10:25,000
if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object,

208
0:10:26.873,000 --> 0:10:29,000
but a process to generate objects.

209
0:10:30.266,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I've shown one simple process that was inspired by nature;

210
0:10:33.539,000 --> 0:10:35,000
there's countless other ones.

211
0:10:36.387,000 --> 0:10:39,000
In short, we have no constraints.

212
0:10:39.834,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Instead, we have processes in our hands right now

213
0:10:43.404,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that allow us to create structures at all scales

214
0:10:47.985,000 --> 0:10:5,000
that we couldn't even have dreamt up.

215
0:10:51.017,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And, if I may add, at one point we will build them.

216
0:10:55.836,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Thank you. (Applause)

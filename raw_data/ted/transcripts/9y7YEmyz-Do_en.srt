1
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm the product of a bold leadership decision.

2
0:00:16.92,000 --> 0:00:19,000
After 1956, when Tunisia became independent,

3
0:00:20.92,000 --> 0:00:22,000
our first president, Habib Bourguiba,

4
0:00:23.68,000 --> 0:00:26,000
decided to invest 20 percent of the country's national budget

5
0:00:27.56,000 --> 0:00:28,000
in education.

6
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Yes, 20 percent,

7
0:00:30.76,000 --> 0:00:33,000
on the high end of the spectrum even by today's standards.

8
0:00:34.48,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Some people protested.

9
0:00:36.4,000 --> 0:00:37,000
What about infrastructure?

10
0:00:38.12,000 --> 0:00:41,000
What about electricity, roads and running water?

11
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Are these not important?

12
0:00:44.159,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I would argue

13
0:00:45.64,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that the most important infrastructure we have are minds,

14
0:00:50.36,000 --> 0:00:51,000
educated minds.

15
0:00:53.28,000 --> 0:00:59,000
President Bourguiba helped establish free, high-quality education

16
0:00:59.52,000 --> 0:01:01,000
for every boy and every girl.

17
0:01:03.76,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And together with millions of other Tunisians,

18
0:01:06.84,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I'm deeply indebted to that historic decision.

19
0:01:10.04,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And that's what brought me here today,

20
0:01:13.28,000 --> 0:01:16,000
because today, we are facing a global learning crisis.

21
0:01:17.84,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I call it learning crisis and not education crisis,

22
0:01:21.2,000 --> 0:01:23,000
because on top of the quarter of a billion children

23
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
who are out of school today,

24
0:01:26.8,000 --> 0:01:3,000
even more, 330 million children,

25
0:01:30.88,000 --> 0:01:32,000
are in school but failing to learn.

26
0:01:35.76,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And if we do nothing,

27
0:01:37.6,000 --> 0:01:38,000
if nothing changes,

28
0:01:39.28,000 --> 0:01:42,000
by 2030, just 13 years from now,

29
0:01:43.28,000 --> 0:01:46,000
half of the world's children and youth,

30
0:01:46.84,000 --> 0:01:5,000
half of 1.6 billion children and youth,

31
0:01:50.92,000 --> 0:01:52,000
will be either out of school or failing to learn.

32
0:01:58.24,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So two years ago, I joined the Education Commission.

33
0:02:02.08,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It's a commission brought together by former UK Prime Minister

34
0:02:05.84,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and UN Special Envoy for Global Education Gordon Brown.

35
0:02:09.96,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Our first task was to find out:

36
0:02:12.04,000 --> 0:02:13,000
How big is the learning crisis?

37
0:02:13.72,000 --> 0:02:14,000
What's actually the scope of the problem?

38
0:02:16.84,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Today we know:

39
0:02:18.32,000 --> 0:02:21,000
half of the world's children by 2030

40
0:02:21.52,000 --> 0:02:22,000
will be failing to learn.

41
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And that's how actually we discovered

42
0:02:25.96,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that we need to change the world's focus from schooling to learning,

43
0:02:30.68,000 --> 0:02:32,000
from just counting how many bodies are in classrooms

44
0:02:33.44,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to actually how many are learning.

45
0:02:36.32,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And the second big task was,

46
0:02:39.52,000 --> 0:02:4,000
can we do anything about this?

47
0:02:41.76,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Can we do anything about this big, vast, silent,

48
0:02:45.2,000 --> 0:02:47,000
maybe most-neglected international crisis?

49
0:02:48.64,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And what we found out is, we can.

50
0:02:51.84,000 --> 0:02:52,000
It's actually amazing.

51
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We can, for the first time,

52
0:02:56.2,000 --> 0:02:59,000
have every child in school and learning

53
0:02:59.84,000 --> 0:03:01,000
within just one generation.

54
0:03:03.84,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And we don't even have to really invent the wheel to do so.

55
0:03:07.6,000 --> 0:03:1,000
We just need to learn from the best in class,

56
0:03:10.76,000 --> 0:03:12,000
but not any best in class --

57
0:03:13.08,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the best in your own class.

58
0:03:16.2,000 --> 0:03:19,000
What we did is actually we looked at countries by income level:

59
0:03:19.96,000 --> 0:03:21,000
low-income, mid-income, high-income.

60
0:03:22.72,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We looked at what the 25 percent fastest improvers in education do,

61
0:03:27.76,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and what we found out is

62
0:03:29.68,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that if every country moves at the same rate as the fastest improvers

63
0:03:34.2,000 --> 0:03:36,000
within their own income level,

64
0:03:36.68,000 --> 0:03:38,000
then within just one generation

65
0:03:39.08,000 --> 0:03:41,000
we can have every child in school and learning.

66
0:03:43.88,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Let me give you an example.

67
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Let's take Tunisia for example.

68
0:03:47.96,000 --> 0:03:5,000
We're not telling Tunisia, "You should move as fast as Finland."

69
0:03:51.76,000 --> 0:03:52,000
No disrespect, Finland.

70
0:03:53.72,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We're telling Tunisia,

71
0:03:55.12,000 --> 0:03:56,000
"Look at Vietnam."

72
0:03:56.48,000 --> 0:04:,000
They spend similar amounts for primary and secondary pupils

73
0:04:00.84,000 --> 0:04:02,000
as percentage of GDP per capita,

74
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
but achieves today higher results.

75
0:04:06.44,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Vietnam introduced a standardized assessment for literacy and numeracy,

76
0:04:11.12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
teachers in Vietnam are better monitored than in other developing countries,

77
0:04:15.88,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and students' achievements are made public.

78
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And it shows in the results.

79
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
In the 2015 PISA --

80
0:04:24.12,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Program for International Student Assessment --

81
0:04:26.8,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Vietnam outperformed many wealthy economies,

82
0:04:29.64,000 --> 0:04:3,000
including the United States.

83
0:04:33.68,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Now, if you're not an education expert,

84
0:04:36.72,000 --> 0:04:37,000
you may ask, "What's new and different?

85
0:04:38.68,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Don't all countries track student progress and make those achievements public?"

86
0:04:44.04,000 --> 0:04:46,000
No. The sad answer is no.

87
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:48,000
We are very far from it.

88
0:04:49.4,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Only half of the developing countries

89
0:04:51.92,000 --> 0:04:54,000
have systematic learning assessment at primary school,

90
0:04:54.96,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and even less so at lower secondary school.

91
0:04:59.08,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So if we don't know

92
0:05:02.36,000 --> 0:05:03,000
if children are learning,

93
0:05:04.08,000 --> 0:05:07,000
how are teachers supposed to focus their attention on delivering results,

94
0:05:08.04,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and how are countries supposed to prioritize education spending

95
0:05:11.64,000 --> 0:05:12,000
actually to delivering results,

96
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
if they don't know if children are learning?

97
0:05:16.6,000 --> 0:05:19,000
That's why the first big transformation

98
0:05:20.48,000 --> 0:05:21,000
before investing

99
0:05:22.28,000 --> 0:05:25,000
is to make the education system deliver results.

100
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Because pouring more money into broken systems

101
0:05:30.92,000 --> 0:05:31,000
may only fund more inefficiencies.

102
0:05:34.24,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And what deeply worries me --

103
0:05:36.08,000 --> 0:05:39,000
if children go to school and don't learn,

104
0:05:39.32,000 --> 0:05:4,000
it devalues education,

105
0:05:41.08,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and it devalues spending on education,

106
0:05:43.28,000 --> 0:05:45,000
so that governments and political parties can say,

107
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:48,000
"Oh, we are spending so much money on education,

108
0:05:48.28,000 --> 0:05:49,000
but children are not learning.

109
0:05:49.76,000 --> 0:05:5,000
They don't have the right skills.

110
0:05:51.76,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Maybe we should spend less."

111
0:05:54.08,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Now, improving current education systems to deliver results

112
0:05:58.72,000 --> 0:06:,000
is important, but won't be enough.

113
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:05,000
What about countries where we won't have enough qualified teachers?

114
0:06:05.2,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Take Somalia, for example.

115
0:06:06.48,000 --> 0:06:09,000
If every student in Somalia became a teacher --

116
0:06:09.52,000 --> 0:06:12,000
every person who finishes tertiary education became a teacher --

117
0:06:12.64,000 --> 0:06:13,000
we won't have enough teachers.

118
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And what about children in refugee camps,

119
0:06:19.24,000 --> 0:06:21,000
or in very remote rural areas?

120
0:06:22.28,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Take Filipe, for example.

121
0:06:24.48,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Filipe lives in one of the thousands of communities

122
0:06:27.72,000 --> 0:06:29,000
alongside the Amazonas rivers.

123
0:06:30.4,000 --> 0:06:33,000
His village of 78 people has 20 families.

124
0:06:34.68,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Filipe and a fellow student

125
0:06:36.52,000 --> 0:06:39,000
were the only two attending grade 11 in 2015.

126
0:06:41.08,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Now, the Amazonas is a state in the northwest of Brazil.

127
0:06:45.12,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It's four and a half times the size of Germany,

128
0:06:47.76,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and it's fully covered in jungle and rivers.

129
0:06:51.12,000 --> 0:06:53,000
A decade ago, Filipe and his fellow student

130
0:06:53.96,000 --> 0:06:54,000
would have had just two alternatives:

131
0:06:57,000 --> 0:07:01,000
moving to Manaus, the capital, or stopping studying altogether,

132
0:07:01.2,000 --> 0:07:02,000
which most of them did.

133
0:07:04.6,000 --> 0:07:07,000
In 2009, however, Brazil passed a new law

134
0:07:08.04,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that made secondary education a guarantee for every Brazilian

135
0:07:12.6,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and an obligation for every state to implement this by 2016.

136
0:07:17.6,000 --> 0:07:2,000
But giving access to high-quality education,

137
0:07:20.84,000 --> 0:07:22,000
you know, in the Amazonas state, is huge and expensive.

138
0:07:23.56,000 --> 0:07:26,000
How are you going to get, you know, math and science and history teachers

139
0:07:27.04,000 --> 0:07:28,000
all over those communities?

140
0:07:28.4,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And even if you find them,

141
0:07:30.04,000 --> 0:07:32,000
many of them would not want to move there.

142
0:07:33.44,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So faced with this impossible task,

143
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:38,000
civil servants and state officials

144
0:07:38.36,000 --> 0:07:41,000
developed amazing creativity and entrepreneurship.

145
0:07:42.12,000 --> 0:07:43,000
They developed the media center solution.

146
0:07:44.12,000 --> 0:07:45,000
It works this way.

147
0:07:45.4,000 --> 0:07:5,000
You have specialized, trained content teachers in Manaus

148
0:07:50.84,000 --> 0:07:52,000
delivering classroom via livestream

149
0:07:53.24,000 --> 0:07:56,000
to over a thousand classrooms in those scattered communities.

150
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
Those classrooms have five to 25 students,

151
0:08:00.28,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and they're supported by a more generalist tutoring teacher

152
0:08:03.92,000 --> 0:08:04,000
for their learning and development.

153
0:08:06.48,000 --> 0:08:08,000
The 60 content teachers in Manaus

154
0:08:08.84,000 --> 0:08:13,000
work with over 2,200 tutoring teachers in those communities

155
0:08:14.32,000 --> 0:08:16,000
to customize lesson plans to the context and time.

156
0:08:19.44,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Now, why is this division

157
0:08:21.4,000 --> 0:08:24,000
between content teacher and tutoring teacher important?

158
0:08:26.6,000 --> 0:08:28,000
First of all, as I told you, because in many countries,

159
0:08:29.24,000 --> 0:08:31,000
we just don't have enough qualified teachers.

160
0:08:31.92,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But secondly also because teachers do too many things

161
0:08:35.24,000 --> 0:08:37,000
they're either not trained for or not supposed to do.

162
0:08:39.04,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Let's look at Chile, for example.

163
0:08:41.56,000 --> 0:08:43,000
In Chile, for every doctor,

164
0:08:43.72,000 --> 0:08:44,000
you have four and a half people,

165
0:08:45.679,000 --> 0:08:47,000
four and a half staff supporting them,

166
0:08:48.52,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and Chile is on the low end of the spectrum here,

167
0:08:53.88,000 --> 0:08:55,000
because in developing countries, on average, every doctor

168
0:08:56.64,000 --> 0:08:57,000
has 10 people supporting them.

169
0:08:59.72,000 --> 0:09:,000
A teacher in Chile, however,

170
0:09:01.68,000 --> 0:09:03,000
has less than half a person,

171
0:09:04.44,000 --> 0:09:06,000
0.3 persons, supporting them.

172
0:09:08.36,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Imagine a hospital ward with 20, 40, 70 patients

173
0:09:12.76,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and you have a doctor doing it all by themselves:

174
0:09:15.84,000 --> 0:09:17,000
no nurses, no medical assistants,

175
0:09:18.28,000 --> 0:09:19,000
no one else.

176
0:09:20.36,000 --> 0:09:22,000
You will say this is absurd and impossible,

177
0:09:22.72,000 --> 0:09:25,000
but this is what teachers are doing all over the world every day

178
0:09:26.24,000 --> 0:09:28,000
with classrooms of 20, 40, or 70 students.

179
0:09:30.4,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So this division between content and tutoring teachers is amazing

180
0:09:34.04,000 --> 0:09:36,000
because it is changing the paradigm of the teacher,

181
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:39,000
so that each does what they can do best

182
0:09:39.24,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and so that children are not just in school

183
0:09:41.48,000 --> 0:09:42,000
but in school and learning.

184
0:09:44.64,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And some of these content teachers,

185
0:09:46.6,000 --> 0:09:48,000
they became celebrity teachers.

186
0:09:48.8,000 --> 0:09:49,000
You know, some of them run for office,

187
0:09:50.68,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and they helped raise the status of the profession

188
0:09:53.52,000 --> 0:09:55,000
so that more students wanted to become teachers.

189
0:09:57.96,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And what I love about this example

190
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:03,000
is beyond changing the paradigm of the teacher.

191
0:10:03.4,000 --> 0:10:06,000
It teaches us how we can harness technology for learning.

192
0:10:07.4,000 --> 0:10:09,000
The live-streaming is bidirectional,

193
0:10:09.8,000 --> 0:10:12,000
so students like Filipe and others can present information back.

194
0:10:14.36,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And we know technology is not always perfect.

195
0:10:17.24,000 --> 0:10:18,000
You know, state officials expect

196
0:10:18.84,000 --> 0:10:2,000
between five to 15 percent of the classrooms

197
0:10:20.96,000 --> 0:10:22,000
every day to be off live-stream

198
0:10:23.08,000 --> 0:10:26,000
because of flood, broken antennas or internet not working.

199
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And yet, Filipe is one of over 300,000 students

200
0:10:31.96,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that benefited from the media center solution

201
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and got access to postprimary education.

202
0:10:38.12,000 --> 0:10:39,000
This is a living example

203
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:42,000
how technology is not just an add-on

204
0:10:42.88,000 --> 0:10:46,000
but can be central to learning and can help us bring school to children

205
0:10:47.52,000 --> 0:10:49,000
if we cannot bring children to school.

206
0:10:53.32,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Now, I hear you.

207
0:10:54.8,000 --> 0:10:55,000
You're going to say,

208
0:10:56.24,000 --> 0:10:59,000
"How are we going to implement this all over the world?"

209
0:10:59.48,000 --> 0:11:,000
I've been in government myself

210
0:11:01.04,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and have seen how difficult it is even to implement the best ideas.

211
0:11:06.24,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So as a commission, we started two initiatives

212
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
to make the "Learning Generation" a reality.

213
0:11:12.4,000 --> 0:11:14,000
The first one is called the Pioneer Country Initiative.

214
0:11:15.56,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Over 20 countries from Africa and Asia

215
0:11:18.12,000 --> 0:11:2,000
have committed to make education their priority

216
0:11:21.08,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and to transform their education systems to deliver results.

217
0:11:24.88,000 --> 0:11:25,000
We've trained country leaders

218
0:11:26.32,000 --> 0:11:28,000
in a methodology called the delivery approach.

219
0:11:29.12,000 --> 0:11:3,000
What this does is basically two things.

220
0:11:31.04,000 --> 0:11:34,000
In the planning phase, we take everyone into a room --

221
0:11:34.36,000 --> 0:11:36,000
teachers, teacher unions, parent associations,

222
0:11:36.8,000 --> 0:11:38,000
government officials, NGOs, everyone --

223
0:11:39.36,000 --> 0:11:41,000
so that the reform and the solution we come up with

224
0:11:41.765,000 --> 0:11:43,000
are shared by everyone and supported by everyone.

225
0:11:45.32,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And in the second phase,

226
0:11:47.28,000 --> 0:11:49,000
it does something special.

227
0:11:49.68,000 --> 0:11:52,000
It's kind of a ruthless focus on follow-up.

228
0:11:54.44,000 --> 0:11:56,000
So week by week you check,

229
0:11:57.32,000 --> 0:11:59,000
has that been done, what was supposed to be done,

230
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and even sometimes sending a person physically to the district or school

231
0:12:04.64,000 --> 0:12:07,000
to check that versus just hoping that it happened.

232
0:12:09.96,000 --> 0:12:11,000
It may sound for many common sense,

233
0:12:12.4,000 --> 0:12:13,000
but it's not common practice,

234
0:12:13.92,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and that's why actually many reforms fail.

235
0:12:18.04,000 --> 0:12:19,000
It has been piloted in Tanzania,

236
0:12:20.72,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and there the pass rate for students in secondary education

237
0:12:26.32,000 --> 0:12:3,000
was increased by 50 percent in just over two years.

238
0:12:32.96,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Now, the next initiative to make the Learning Generation a reality

239
0:12:36.56,000 --> 0:12:38,000
is financing. Who's going to pay for this?

240
0:12:40.04,000 --> 0:12:41,000
So we believe and argue

241
0:12:41.48,000 --> 0:12:44,000
that domestic financing has to be the backbone of education investment.

242
0:12:45.68,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Do you remember when I told you about Vietnam earlier

243
0:12:48.28,000 --> 0:12:5,000
outperforming the United States in PISA?

244
0:12:51.24,000 --> 0:12:53,000
That's due to a better education system,

245
0:12:53.4,000 --> 0:12:55,000
but also to Vietnam increasing their investment

246
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:59,000
from seven to 20 percent of their national budget in two decades.

247
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
But what happens if countries want to borrow money for education?

248
0:13:04.96,000 --> 0:13:07,000
If you wanted to borrow money to build a bridge or a road,

249
0:13:08.2,000 --> 0:13:1,000
it's quite easy and straightforward,

250
0:13:10.4,000 --> 0:13:11,000
but not for education.

251
0:13:12.68,000 --> 0:13:16,000
It's easier to make a shiny picture of a bridge and show it to everyone

252
0:13:16.72,000 --> 0:13:18,000
than one of an educated mind.

253
0:13:19.32,000 --> 0:13:21,000
That's kind of a longer term commitment.

254
0:13:22.555,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So we came up with a solution

255
0:13:23.96,000 --> 0:13:26,000
to help countries escape the middle income trap,

256
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
countries that are not poor enough or not poor, thankfully, anymore,

257
0:13:31.4,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that cannot profit from grants or interest-free loans,

258
0:13:34.92,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and they're not rich enough

259
0:13:36.44,000 --> 0:13:38,000
to be able to have attractive interests on their loans.

260
0:13:39.92,000 --> 0:13:42,000
So we're pooling donor money in a finance facility for education,

261
0:13:43.88,000 --> 0:13:45,000
which will provide more finance for education.

262
0:13:46.28,000 --> 0:13:49,000
We will subsidize, or even eliminate completely,

263
0:13:49.56,000 --> 0:13:5,000
interest payments on the loans

264
0:13:51.52,000 --> 0:13:53,000
so that countries that commit to reforms

265
0:13:53.84,000 --> 0:13:54,000
can borrow money,

266
0:13:55.52,000 --> 0:13:58,000
reform their education system, and pay this money over time

267
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:01,000
while benefiting from a better-educated population.

268
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:07,000
This solution has been recognized in the last G20 meeting in Germany,

269
0:14:07.6,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and so finally today education is on the international agenda.

270
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
But let me bring this back to the personal level,

271
0:14:17.52,000 --> 0:14:19,000
because this is where the impact lands.

272
0:14:21.12,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Without that decision to invest a young country's budget,

273
0:14:25.32,000 --> 0:14:28,000
20 percent of a young country's budget in education,

274
0:14:28.96,000 --> 0:14:31,000
I would have never been able to go to school,

275
0:14:32.12,000 --> 0:14:34,000
let alone in 2014

276
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
becoming a minister in the government

277
0:14:36.08,000 --> 0:14:38,000
that successfully ended the transition phase.

278
0:14:39.48,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Tunisia's Nobel Peace Prize in 2015

279
0:14:42.2,000 --> 0:14:45,000
as the only democracy that emerged from the Arab Spring

280
0:14:45.6,000 --> 0:14:47,000
is a legacy to that bold leadership decision.

281
0:14:50.44,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Education is the civil rights struggle,

282
0:14:53.24,000 --> 0:14:55,000
it's the human rights struggle of our generation.

283
0:14:56.64,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Quality education for all:

284
0:14:58.68,000 --> 0:15:,000
that's the freedom fight that we've got to win.

285
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Thank you.

286
0:15:04.4,000 --> 0:15:07,000
(Applause)

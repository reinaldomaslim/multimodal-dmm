1
0:00:12.825,000 --> 0:00:13,000
A few years ago,

2
0:00:14.747,000 --> 0:00:17,000
my mom developed rheumatoid arthritis.

3
0:00:18.989,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Her wrists, knees and toes swelled up, causing crippling, chronic pain.

4
0:00:26.391,000 --> 0:00:27,000
She had to file for disability.

5
0:00:28.734,000 --> 0:00:3,000
She stopped attending our local mosque.

6
0:00:31.516,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Some mornings it was too painful for her to brush her teeth.

7
0:00:36.339,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I wanted to help.

8
0:00:38.5,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But I didn't know how.

9
0:00:40.716,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I'm not a doctor.

10
0:00:43.005,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So, what I am is a historian of medicine.

11
0:00:47.93,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So I started to research the history of chronic pain.

12
0:00:51.957,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Turns out, UCLA has an entire history of pain collection

13
0:00:56.002,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in their archives.

14
0:00:58.593,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And I found a story -- a fantastic story --

15
0:01:02.069,000 --> 0:01:07,000
of a man who saved -- rescued -- millions of people from pain;

16
0:01:07.889,000 --> 0:01:08,000
people like my mom.

17
0:01:10.772,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Yet, I had never heard of him.

18
0:01:12.256,000 --> 0:01:15,000
There were no biographies of him, no Hollywood movies.

19
0:01:16.483,000 --> 0:01:19,000
His name was John J. Bonica.

20
0:01:21.07,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But when our story begins,

21
0:01:22.642,000 --> 0:01:26,000
he was better known as Johnny "Bull" Walker.

22
0:01:28.611,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It was a summer day in 1941.

23
0:01:31.857,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The circus had just arrived in the tiny town of Brookfield, New York.

24
0:01:37.486,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Spectators flocked to see the wire-walkers, the tramp clowns --

25
0:01:41.431,000 --> 0:01:43,000
if they were lucky, the human cannonball.

26
0:01:44.19,000 --> 0:01:47,000
They also came to see the strongman, Johnny "Bull" Walker,

27
0:01:48.098,000 --> 0:01:51,000
a brawny bully who'd pin you for a dollar.

28
0:01:52.467,000 --> 0:01:54,000
You know, on that particular day, a voice rang out

29
0:01:55.432,000 --> 0:01:56,000
over the circus P.A. system.

30
0:01:57.441,000 --> 0:02:,000
They needed a doctor urgently, in the live animal tent.

31
0:02:01.302,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Something had gone wrong with the lion tamer.

32
0:02:03.71,000 --> 0:02:06,000
The climax of his act had gone wrong,

33
0:02:06.863,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and his head was stuck inside the lion's mouth.

34
0:02:11.629,000 --> 0:02:12,000
He was running out of air;

35
0:02:13.312,000 --> 0:02:15,000
the crowd watched in horror

36
0:02:15.503,000 --> 0:02:17,000
as he struggled and then passed out.

37
0:02:18.788,000 --> 0:02:21,000
When the lion finally did relax its jaws,

38
0:02:22.073,000 --> 0:02:26,000
the lion tamer just slumped to the ground, motionless.

39
0:02:27.813,000 --> 0:02:29,000
When he came to a few minutes later,

40
0:02:30.206,000 --> 0:02:32,000
he saw a familiar figure hunched over him.

41
0:02:33.169,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It was Bull Walker.

42
0:02:35.816,000 --> 0:02:4,000
The strongman had given the lion tamer mouth-to-mouth, and saved his life.

43
0:02:42.864,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Now, the strongman hadn't told anyone,

44
0:02:44.716,000 --> 0:02:47,000
but he was actually a third-year medical student.

45
0:02:48.788,000 --> 0:02:51,000
He toured with the circus during summers to pay tuition,

46
0:02:52.474,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but kept it a secret to protect his persona.

47
0:02:55.787,000 --> 0:02:58,000
He was supposed to be a brute, a villain --

48
0:02:59.215,000 --> 0:03:01,000
not a nerdy do-gooder.

49
0:03:02.535,000 --> 0:03:04,000
His medical colleagues didn't know his secret, either.

50
0:03:05.156,000 --> 0:03:09,000
As he put it, "If you were an athlete, you were a dumb dodo."

51
0:03:09.849,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So he didn't tell them about the circus,

52
0:03:12.344,000 --> 0:03:17,000
or about how he wrestled professionally on evenings and weekends.

53
0:03:18.353,000 --> 0:03:2,000
He used a pseudonym like Bull Walker,

54
0:03:20.997,000 --> 0:03:21,000
or later, the Masked Marvel.

55
0:03:23.627,000 --> 0:03:26,000
He even kept it a secret that same year,

56
0:03:27.159,000 --> 0:03:3,000
when he was crowned the Light Heavyweight Champion

57
0:03:30.542,000 --> 0:03:31,000
of the world.

58
0:03:33.313,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Over the years, John J. Bonica lived these parallel lives.

59
0:03:38.515,000 --> 0:03:39,000
He was a wrestler;

60
0:03:40.233,000 --> 0:03:41,000
he was a doctor.

61
0:03:41.788,000 --> 0:03:42,000
He was a heel;

62
0:03:43.334,000 --> 0:03:44,000
he was a hero.

63
0:03:45.038,000 --> 0:03:46,000
He inflicted pain,

64
0:03:46.858,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and he treated it.

65
0:03:49.242,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And he didn’t know it at the time, but over the next five decades,

66
0:03:52.768,000 --> 0:03:54,000
he'd draw on these dueling identities

67
0:03:55.61,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to forge a whole new way to think about pain.

68
0:03:59.62,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It'd change modern medicine so much so, that decades later,

69
0:04:03.774,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Time magazine would call him pain relief's founding father.

70
0:04:09.351,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But that all happened later.

71
0:04:12.179,000 --> 0:04:17,000
In 1942, Bonica graduated medical school and married Emma,

72
0:04:17.815,000 --> 0:04:2,000
his sweetheart, whom he had met at one of his matches years before.

73
0:04:22.505,000 --> 0:04:24,000
He still wrestled in secret -- he had to.

74
0:04:25.781,000 --> 0:04:29,000
His internship at New York's St. Vincent's Hospital paid nothing.

75
0:04:31.101,000 --> 0:04:34,000
With his championship belt, he wrestled in big-ticket venues,

76
0:04:34.877,000 --> 0:04:35,000
like Madison Square Garden,

77
0:04:36.838,000 --> 0:04:37,000
against big-time opponents,

78
0:04:38.538,000 --> 0:04:4,000
like Everett "The Blonde Bear" Marshall,

79
0:04:41.411,000 --> 0:04:44,000
or three-time world champion, Angelo Savoldi.

80
0:04:46.192,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The matches took a toll on his body;

81
0:04:48.993,000 --> 0:04:51,000
he tore hip joints, fractured ribs.

82
0:04:52.295,000 --> 0:04:56,000
One night, The Terrible Turk's big toe scratched a scar like Capone's

83
0:04:57.217,000 --> 0:04:58,000
down the side of his face.

84
0:04:59.302,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The next morning at work, he had to wear a surgical mask to hide it.

85
0:05:04.45,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Twice Bonica showed up to the O.R. with one eye so bruised,

86
0:05:09.088,000 --> 0:05:1,000
he couldn't see out of it.

87
0:05:11.138,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But worst of all were his mangled cauliflower ears.

88
0:05:16.094,000 --> 0:05:19,000
He said they felt like two baseballs on the sides of his head.

89
0:05:21.153,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Pain just kept accumulating in his life.

90
0:05:25.177,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Next, he watched his wife go into labor at his hospital.

91
0:05:29.509,000 --> 0:05:32,000
She heaved and pushed, clearly in anguish.

92
0:05:33.657,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Her obstetrician called out to the intern on duty

93
0:05:36.125,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to give her a few drops of ether to ease her pain.

94
0:05:39.519,000 --> 0:05:42,000
But the intern was a young guy, just three weeks on the job --

95
0:05:42.904,000 --> 0:05:44,000
he was jittery, and in applying the ether,

96
0:05:45.864,000 --> 0:05:46,000
irritated Emma's throat.

97
0:05:48.145,000 --> 0:05:51,000
She vomited and choked, and started to turn blue.

98
0:05:52.895,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Bonica, who was watching all this, pushed the intern out of the way,

99
0:05:58.259,000 --> 0:05:59,000
cleared her airway,

100
0:05:59.864,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and saved his wife and his unborn daughter.

101
0:06:04.172,000 --> 0:06:08,000
At that moment, he decided to devote his life to anesthesiology.

102
0:06:09.414,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Later, he'd even go on to help develop the epidural, for delivering mothers.

103
0:06:14.85,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But before he could focus on obstetrics,

104
0:06:17.009,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Bonica had to report for basic training.

105
0:06:22.373,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Right around D-Day,

106
0:06:23.991,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Bonica showed up to Madigan Army Medical Center,

107
0:06:27.237,000 --> 0:06:28,000
near Tacoma.

108
0:06:28.783,000 --> 0:06:32,000
At 7,700 beds, it was one of the largest army hospitals in America.

109
0:06:34.242,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Bonica was in charge of all pain control there.

110
0:06:37.618,000 --> 0:06:39,000
He was only 27.

111
0:06:40.47,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Treating so many patients, Bonica started noticing cases

112
0:06:43.788,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that contradicted everything he had learned.

113
0:06:46.976,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Pain was supposed to be a kind of alarm bell -- in a good way --

114
0:06:51.846,000 --> 0:06:54,000
a body's way of signaling an injury, like a broken arm.

115
0:06:56.538,000 --> 0:06:57,000
But in some cases,

116
0:06:58.174,000 --> 0:07:01,000
like after a patient had a leg amputated,

117
0:07:01.673,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that patient might still complain of pain in that nonexistent leg.

118
0:07:06.231,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But if the injury had been treated, why would the alarm bell keep ringing?

119
0:07:10.861,000 --> 0:07:14,000
There were other cases in which there was no evidence of an injury whatsoever,

120
0:07:15.014,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and yet, still the patient hurt.

121
0:07:18.678,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Bonica tracked down all the specialists at his hospital -- surgeons,

122
0:07:22.67,000 --> 0:07:24,000
neurologists, psychiatrists, others.

123
0:07:25.782,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And he tried to get their opinions on his patients.

124
0:07:29.643,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It took too long, so he started organizing group meetings over lunch.

125
0:07:35.123,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It would be like a tag team of specialists going up against the patient's pain.

126
0:07:39.613,000 --> 0:07:42,000
No one had ever focused on pain this way before.

127
0:07:44.928,000 --> 0:07:46,000
After that, he hit the books.

128
0:07:47.845,000 --> 0:07:49,000
He read every medical textbook he could get his hands on,

129
0:07:50.732,000 --> 0:07:52,000
carefully noting every mention of the word "pain."

130
0:07:54.282,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Out of the 14,000 pages he read,

131
0:07:58.187,000 --> 0:08:02,000
the word "pain" was on 17 and a half of them.

132
0:08:02.908,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Seventeen and a half.

133
0:08:04.934,000 --> 0:08:09,000
For the most basic, most common, most frustrating part of being a patient.

134
0:08:10.875,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Bonica was shocked -- I'm quoting him,

135
0:08:13.006,000 --> 0:08:17,000
he said, "What the hell kind of conclusion can you come to there?

136
0:08:17.484,000 --> 0:08:2,000
The most important thing from the patient's perspective,

137
0:08:20.69,000 --> 0:08:21,000
they don't talk about."

138
0:08:23.295,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So over the next eight years, Bonica would talk about it.

139
0:08:27.209,000 --> 0:08:29,000
He'd write about it; he'd write those missing pages.

140
0:08:30.057,000 --> 0:08:33,000
He wrote what would later be known as the Bible of Pain.

141
0:08:34.575,000 --> 0:08:37,000
In it he proposed new strategies,

142
0:08:38.016,000 --> 0:08:41,000
new treatments using nerve-block injections.

143
0:08:41.614,000 --> 0:08:43,000
He proposed a new institution, the Pain Clinic,

144
0:08:44.381,000 --> 0:08:45,000
based on those lunchtime meetings.

145
0:08:47.248,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But the most important thing about his book

146
0:08:49.683,000 --> 0:08:53,000
was that it was kind of an emotional alarm bell for medicine.

147
0:08:54.486,000 --> 0:08:59,000
A desperate plea to doctors to take pain seriously

148
0:09:00.491,000 --> 0:09:01,000
in patients' lives.

149
0:09:03.321,000 --> 0:09:06,000
He recast the very purpose of medicine.

150
0:09:07.373,000 --> 0:09:11,000
The goal wasn't to make patients better;

151
0:09:11.582,000 --> 0:09:14,000
it was to make patients feel better.

152
0:09:16.955,000 --> 0:09:18,000
He pushed his pain agenda for decades,

153
0:09:19.066,000 --> 0:09:22,000
before it finally took hold in the mid-'70s.

154
0:09:22.831,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Hundreds of pain clinics sprung up all over the world.

155
0:09:27.711,000 --> 0:09:3,000
But as they did -- a tragic twist.

156
0:09:31.754,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Bonica's years of wrestling caught up to him.

157
0:09:36.597,000 --> 0:09:38,000
He had been out of the ring for over 20 years,

158
0:09:38.773,000 --> 0:09:42,000
but those 1,500 professional bouts had left a mark on his body.

159
0:09:43.769,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Still in his mid-50s, he suffered severe osteoarthritis.

160
0:09:48.36,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Over the next 20 years he'd have 22 surgeries,

161
0:09:52.403,000 --> 0:09:54,000
including four spine operations,

162
0:09:54.954,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and hip replacement after hip replacement.

163
0:09:58.11,000 --> 0:10:01,000
He could barely raise his arm, turn his neck.

164
0:10:02.144,000 --> 0:10:04,000
He needed aluminum crutches to walk.

165
0:10:05.879,000 --> 0:10:09,000
His friends and former students became his doctors.

166
0:10:09.923,000 --> 0:10:13,000
One recalled that he probably had more nerve-block injections

167
0:10:14.149,000 --> 0:10:16,000
than anyone else on the planet.

168
0:10:18.043,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Already a workaholic, he worked even more --

169
0:10:21.505,000 --> 0:10:22,000
15- to 18-hour days.

170
0:10:23.922,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Healing others became more than just his job,

171
0:10:26.455,000 --> 0:10:28,000
it was his own most effective form of relief.

172
0:10:30.51,000 --> 0:10:33,000
"If I wasn't as busy as I am," he told a reporter at the time,

173
0:10:34.345,000 --> 0:10:37,000
"I would be a completely disabled guy."

174
0:10:39.423,000 --> 0:10:42,000
On a business trip to Florida in the early 1980s,

175
0:10:42.986,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Bonica got a former student to drive him to the Hyde Park area in Tampa.

176
0:10:49.338,000 --> 0:10:53,000
They drove past palm trees and pulled up to an old mansion,

177
0:10:53.506,000 --> 0:10:57,000
with giant silver howitzer cannons hidden in the garage.

178
0:10:58.895,000 --> 0:11:,000
The house belonged to the Zacchini family,

179
0:11:01.858,000 --> 0:11:03,000
who were something like American circus royalty.

180
0:11:06.229,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Decades earlier, Bonica had watched them,

181
0:11:08.826,000 --> 0:11:1,000
clad in silver jumpsuits and goggles,

182
0:11:11.737,000 --> 0:11:14,000
doing the act they pioneered -- the Human Cannonball.

183
0:11:16.772,000 --> 0:11:19,000
But now they were like him: retired.

184
0:11:21.267,000 --> 0:11:24,000
That generation is all dead now, including Bonica,

185
0:11:24.862,000 --> 0:11:26,000
so there's no way to know exactly what they said that day.

186
0:11:28.475,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But still, I love imagining it.

187
0:11:31.233,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The strongman and the human cannonballs reunited,

188
0:11:34.51,000 --> 0:11:36,000
showing off old scars, and new ones.

189
0:11:37.802,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Maybe Bonica gave them medical advice.

190
0:11:40.082,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Maybe he told them what he later said in an oral history,

191
0:11:45.432,000 --> 0:11:5,000
which is that his time in the circus and wrestling deeply molded his life.

192
0:11:53.286,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Bonica saw pain close up.

193
0:11:57.236,000 --> 0:11:59,000
He felt it. He lived it.

194
0:12:00.453,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And it made it impossible for him to ignore in others.

195
0:12:05.449,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Out of that empathy, he spun a whole new field,

196
0:12:08.587,000 --> 0:12:11,000
played a major role in getting medicine to acknowledge pain

197
0:12:11.723,000 --> 0:12:12,000
in and of itself.

198
0:12:14.627,000 --> 0:12:15,000
In that same oral history,

199
0:12:16.563,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Bonica claimed that pain

200
0:12:19.096,000 --> 0:12:23,000
is the most complex human experience.

201
0:12:24.215,000 --> 0:12:27,000
That it involves your past life, your current life,

202
0:12:28.053,000 --> 0:12:3,000
your interactions, your family.

203
0:12:31.256,000 --> 0:12:33,000
That was definitely true for Bonica.

204
0:12:34.593,000 --> 0:12:36,000
But it was also true for my mom.

205
0:12:40.043,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It's easy for doctors to see my mom

206
0:12:43.366,000 --> 0:12:46,000
as a kind of professional patient,

207
0:12:46.652,000 --> 0:12:49,000
a woman who just spends her days in waiting rooms.

208
0:12:51.714,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Sometimes I get stuck seeing her that same way.

209
0:12:57.076,000 --> 0:12:58,000
But as I saw Bonica's pain --

210
0:12:59.067,000 --> 0:13:03,000
a testament to his fully lived life --

211
0:13:03.623,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I started to remember all the things that my mom's pain holds.

212
0:13:10.37,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Before they got swollen and arthritic,

213
0:13:14.162,000 --> 0:13:17,000
my mom's fingers clacked away

214
0:13:17.501,000 --> 0:13:19,000
in the hospital H.R. department where she worked.

215
0:13:21.15,000 --> 0:13:25,000
They folded samosas for our entire mosque.

216
0:13:26.734,000 --> 0:13:29,000
When I was a kid, they cut my hair,

217
0:13:30.459,000 --> 0:13:32,000
wiped my nose,

218
0:13:32.935,000 --> 0:13:33,000
tied my shoes.

219
0:13:41.832,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Thank you.

220
0:13:43.181,000 --> 0:13:49,000
(Applause)

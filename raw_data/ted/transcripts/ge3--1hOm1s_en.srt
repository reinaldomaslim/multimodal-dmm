1
0:00:13.28,000 --> 0:00:16,000
In my lab, we build autonomous aerial robots

2
0:00:16.96,000 --> 0:00:17,000
like the one you see flying here.

3
0:00:20.72,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Unlike the commercially available drones that you can buy today,

4
0:00:24.44,000 --> 0:00:26,000
this robot doesn't have any GPS on board.

5
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So without GPS,

6
0:00:29.4,000 --> 0:00:32,000
it's hard for robots like this to determine their position.

7
0:00:34.24,000 --> 0:00:38,000
This robot uses onboard sensors, cameras and laser scanners,

8
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to scan the environment.

9
0:00:40.72,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It detects features from the environment,

10
0:00:43.8,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and it determines where it is relative to those features,

11
0:00:46.56,000 --> 0:00:48,000
using a method of triangulation.

12
0:00:48.72,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And then it can assemble all these features into a map,

13
0:00:52.2,000 --> 0:00:53,000
like you see behind me.

14
0:00:53.96,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And this map then allows the robot to understand where the obstacles are

15
0:00:57.92,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and navigate in a collision-free manner.

16
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
What I want to show you next

17
0:01:03.28,000 --> 0:01:06,000
is a set of experiments we did inside our laboratory,

18
0:01:06.52,000 --> 0:01:09,000
where this robot was able to go for longer distances.

19
0:01:10.4,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So here you'll see, on the top right, what the robot sees with the camera.

20
0:01:15.44,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And on the main screen --

21
0:01:16.68,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and of course this is sped up by a factor of four --

22
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
on the main screen you'll see the map that it's building.

23
0:01:21.851,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So this is a high-resolution map of the corridor around our laboratory.

24
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And in a minute you'll see it enter our lab,

25
0:01:28.52,000 --> 0:01:3,000
which is recognizable by the clutter that you see.

26
0:01:31.4,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:32.44,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But the main point I want to convey to you

28
0:01:34.472,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is that these robots are capable of building high-resolution maps

29
0:01:38.08,000 --> 0:01:4,000
at five centimeters resolution,

30
0:01:40.6,000 --> 0:01:44,000
allowing somebody who is outside the lab, or outside the building

31
0:01:44.8,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to deploy these without actually going inside,

32
0:01:48.04,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and trying to infer what happens inside the building.

33
0:01:52.4,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Now there's one problem with robots like this.

34
0:01:55.6,000 --> 0:01:57,000
The first problem is it's pretty big.

35
0:01:58.12,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Because it's big, it's heavy.

36
0:02:00.64,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And these robots consume about 100 watts per pound.

37
0:02:04.36,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And this makes for a very short mission life.

38
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:09,000
The second problem

39
0:02:09.48,000 --> 0:02:12,000
is that these robots have onboard sensors that end up being very expensive --

40
0:02:13.4,000 --> 0:02:16,000
a laser scanner, a camera and the processors.

41
0:02:17.28,000 --> 0:02:2,000
That drives up the cost of this robot.

42
0:02:21.44,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So we asked ourselves a question:

43
0:02:24.12,000 --> 0:02:27,000
what consumer product can you buy in an electronics store

44
0:02:27.92,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that is inexpensive, that's lightweight, that has sensing onboard and computation?

45
0:02:36.08,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And we invented the flying phone.

46
0:02:38.76,000 --> 0:02:39,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:40.72,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So this robot uses a Samsung Galaxy smartphone that you can buy off the shelf,

48
0:02:46.92,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and all you need is an app that you can download from our app store.

49
0:02:50.96,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And you can see this robot reading the letters, "TED" in this case,

50
0:02:55.2,000 --> 0:02:57,000
looking at the corners of the "T" and the "E"

51
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and then triangulating off of that, flying autonomously.

52
0:03:02.72,000 --> 0:03:05,000
That joystick is just there to make sure if the robot goes crazy,

53
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Giuseppe can kill it.

54
0:03:07.44,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Laughter)

55
0:03:10.92,000 --> 0:03:13,000
In addition to building these small robots,

56
0:03:14.76,000 --> 0:03:18,000
we also experiment with aggressive behaviors, like you see here.

57
0:03:19.92,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So this robot is now traveling at two to three meters per second,

58
0:03:25.24,000 --> 0:03:28,000
pitching and rolling aggressively as it changes direction.

59
0:03:28.76,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The main point is we can have smaller robots that can go faster

60
0:03:33.04,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and then travel in these very unstructured environments.

61
0:03:37.12,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And in this next video,

62
0:03:39.2,000 --> 0:03:44,000
just like you see this bird, an eagle, gracefully coordinating its wings,

63
0:03:45.12,000 --> 0:03:49,000
its eyes and feet to grab prey out of the water,

64
0:03:49.44,000 --> 0:03:5,000
our robot can go fishing, too.

65
0:03:51.36,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:52.88,000 --> 0:03:56,000
In this case, this is a Philly cheesesteak hoagie that it's grabbing out of thin air.

67
0:03:56.96,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:59.68,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So you can see this robot going at about three meters per second,

69
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:08,000
which is faster than walking speed, coordinating its arms, its claws

70
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and its flight with split-second timing to achieve this maneuver.

71
0:04:14.12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
In another experiment,

72
0:04:15.36,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I want to show you how the robot adapts its flight

73
0:04:19.04,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to control its suspended payload,

74
0:04:21.44,000 --> 0:04:24,000
whose length is actually larger than the width of the window.

75
0:04:25.68,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So in order to accomplish this,

76
0:04:27.4,000 --> 0:04:3,000
it actually has to pitch and adjust the altitude

77
0:04:31.12,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and swing the payload through.

78
0:04:38.92,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But of course we want to make these even smaller,

79
0:04:41.24,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and we're inspired in particular by honeybees.

80
0:04:44.28,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So if you look at honeybees, and this is a slowed down video,

81
0:04:47.56,000 --> 0:04:5,000
they're so small, the inertia is so lightweight --

82
0:04:51.96,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that they don't care -- they bounce off my hand, for example.

84
0:04:56.72,000 --> 0:04:59,000
This is a little robot that mimics the honeybee behavior.

85
0:05:00.6,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And smaller is better,

86
0:05:01.84,000 --> 0:05:04,000
because along with the small size you get lower inertia.

87
0:05:05.4,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Along with lower inertia --

88
0:05:06.96,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Robot buzzing, laughter)

89
0:05:09.84,000 --> 0:05:11,000
along with lower inertia, you're resistant to collisions.

90
0:05:12.68,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And that makes you more robust.

91
0:05:15.8,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So just like these honeybees, we build small robots.

92
0:05:18.48,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And this particular one is only 25 grams in weight.

93
0:05:21.88,000 --> 0:05:23,000
It consumes only six watts of power.

94
0:05:24.44,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And it can travel up to six meters per second.

95
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So if I normalize that to its size,

96
0:05:29.36,000 --> 0:05:32,000
it's like a Boeing 787 traveling ten times the speed of sound.

97
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:38.12,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And I want to show you an example.

99
0:05:40.84,000 --> 0:05:45,000
This is probably the first planned mid-air collision, at one-twentieth normal speed.

100
0:05:46.12,000 --> 0:05:48,000
These are going at a relative speed of two meters per second,

101
0:05:49.002,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and this illustrates the basic principle.

102
0:05:52.2,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The two-gram carbon fiber cage around it prevents the propellers from entangling,

103
0:05:57.2,000 --> 0:06:02,000
but essentially the collision is absorbed and the robot responds to the collisions.

104
0:06:02.52,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And so small also means safe.

105
0:06:05.4,000 --> 0:06:07,000
In my lab, as we developed these robots,

106
0:06:07.44,000 --> 0:06:08,000
we start off with these big robots

107
0:06:09.084,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and then now we're down to these small robots.

108
0:06:11.92,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And if you plot a histogram of the number of Band-Aids we've ordered

109
0:06:15.4,000 --> 0:06:17,000
in the past, that sort of tailed off now.

110
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Because these robots are really safe.

111
0:06:20.76,000 --> 0:06:22,000
The small size has some disadvantages,

112
0:06:23.24,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and nature has found a number of ways to compensate for these disadvantages.

113
0:06:27.96,000 --> 0:06:31,000
The basic idea is they aggregate to form large groups, or swarms.

114
0:06:32.32,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So, similarly, in our lab, we try to create artificial robot swarms.

115
0:06:36.32,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And this is quite challenging

116
0:06:37.725,000 --> 0:06:4,000
because now you have to think about networks of robots.

117
0:06:41.36,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And within each robot,

118
0:06:42.68,000 --> 0:06:47,000
you have to think about the interplay of sensing, communication, computation --

119
0:06:48.32,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and this network then becomes quite difficult to control and manage.

120
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So from nature we take away three organizing principles

121
0:06:57.48,000 --> 0:07:,000
that essentially allow us to develop our algorithms.

122
0:07:01.64,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The first idea is that robots need to be aware of their neighbors.

123
0:07:06.2,000 --> 0:07:09,000
They need to be able to sense and communicate with their neighbors.

124
0:07:10.04,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So this video illustrates the basic idea.

125
0:07:12.72,000 --> 0:07:13,000
You have four robots --

126
0:07:14.04,000 --> 0:07:18,000
one of the robots has actually been hijacked by a human operator, literally.

127
0:07:19.217,000 --> 0:07:21,000
But because the robots interact with each other,

128
0:07:21.48,000 --> 0:07:22,000
they sense their neighbors,

129
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
they essentially follow.

130
0:07:24.48,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And here there's a single person able to lead this network of followers.

131
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So again, it's not because all the robots know where they're supposed to go.

132
0:07:37.08,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It's because they're just reacting to the positions of their neighbors.

133
0:07:43.72,000 --> 0:07:47,000
(Laughter)

134
0:07:48.28,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So the next experiment illustrates the second organizing principle.

135
0:07:54.92,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And this principle has to do with the principle of anonymity.

136
0:07:59.4,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Here the key idea is that

137
0:08:03.72,000 --> 0:08:07,000
the robots are agnostic to the identities of their neighbors.

138
0:08:08.44,000 --> 0:08:1,000
They're asked to form a circular shape,

139
0:08:11.08,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and no matter how many robots you introduce into the formation,

140
0:08:14.4,000 --> 0:08:16,000
or how many robots you pull out,

141
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:2,000
each robot is simply reacting to its neighbor.

142
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
It's aware of the fact that it needs to form the circular shape,

143
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but collaborating with its neighbors

144
0:08:26.96,000 --> 0:08:29,000
it forms the shape without central coordination.

145
0:08:31.52,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Now if you put these ideas together,

146
0:08:33.96,000 --> 0:08:36,000
the third idea is that we essentially give these robots

147
0:08:37.88,000 --> 0:08:41,000
mathematical descriptions of the shape they need to execute.

148
0:08:42.2,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And these shapes can be varying as a function of time,

149
0:08:45.72,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and you'll see these robots start from a circular formation,

150
0:08:50.24,000 --> 0:08:53,000
change into a rectangular formation, stretch into a straight line,

151
0:08:53.52,000 --> 0:08:54,000
back into an ellipse.

152
0:08:54.919,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And they do this with the same kind of split-second coordination

153
0:08:58.56,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that you see in natural swarms, in nature.

154
0:09:03.08,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So why work with swarms?

155
0:09:05.24,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Let me tell you about two applications that we are very interested in.

156
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
The first one has to do with agriculture,

157
0:09:12.56,000 --> 0:09:15,000
which is probably the biggest problem that we're facing worldwide.

158
0:09:16.76,000 --> 0:09:17,000
As you well know,

159
0:09:18.04,000 --> 0:09:21,000
one in every seven persons in this earth is malnourished.

160
0:09:21.92,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Most of the land that we can cultivate has already been cultivated.

161
0:09:25.96,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And the efficiency of most systems in the world is improving,

162
0:09:29.2,000 --> 0:09:32,000
but our production system efficiency is actually declining.

163
0:09:33.08,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And that's mostly because of water shortage, crop diseases, climate change

164
0:09:37.32,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and a couple of other things.

165
0:09:39.36,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So what can robots do?

166
0:09:41.2,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Well, we adopt an approach that's called Precision Farming in the community.

167
0:09:45.84,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And the basic idea is that we fly aerial robots through orchards,

168
0:09:51.24,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and then we build precision models of individual plants.

169
0:09:54.829,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So just like personalized medicine,

170
0:09:56.52,000 --> 0:10:,000
while you might imagine wanting to treat every patient individually,

171
0:10:01.36,000 --> 0:10:04,000
what we'd like to do is build models of individual plants

172
0:10:05.08,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and then tell the farmer what kind of inputs every plant needs --

173
0:10:09.24,000 --> 0:10:13,000
the inputs in this case being water, fertilizer and pesticide.

174
0:10:14.64,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Here you'll see robots traveling through an apple orchard,

175
0:10:18.28,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and in a minute you'll see two of its companions

176
0:10:20.56,000 --> 0:10:21,000
doing the same thing on the left side.

177
0:10:22.8,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And what they're doing is essentially building a map of the orchard.

178
0:10:26.48,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Within the map is a map of every plant in this orchard.

179
0:10:29.32,000 --> 0:10:3,000
(Robot buzzing)

180
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Let's see what those maps look like.

181
0:10:32.92,000 --> 0:10:36,000
In the next video, you'll see the cameras that are being used on this robot.

182
0:10:37.24,000 --> 0:10:4,000
On the top-left is essentially a standard color camera.

183
0:10:41.64,000 --> 0:10:44,000
On the left-center is an infrared camera.

184
0:10:44.96,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And on the bottom-left is a thermal camera.

185
0:10:48.76,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And on the main panel, you're seeing a three-dimensional reconstruction

186
0:10:52.12,000 --> 0:10:58,000
of every tree in the orchard as the sensors fly right past the trees.

187
0:10:59.64,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Armed with information like this, we can do several things.

188
0:11:04.2,000 --> 0:11:08,000
The first and possibly the most important thing we can do is very simple:

189
0:11:08.48,000 --> 0:11:1,000
count the number of fruits on every tree.

190
0:11:11.52,000 --> 0:11:15,000
By doing this, you tell the farmer how many fruits she has in every tree

191
0:11:16.08,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and allow her to estimate the yield in the orchard,

192
0:11:20.36,000 --> 0:11:22,000
optimizing the production chain downstream.

193
0:11:23.64,000 --> 0:11:24,000
The second thing we can do

194
0:11:25.28,000 --> 0:11:29,000
is take models of plants, construct three-dimensional reconstructions,

195
0:11:29.8,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and from that estimate the canopy size,

196
0:11:32.36,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and then correlate the canopy size to the amount of leaf area on every plant.

197
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And this is called the leaf area index.

198
0:11:38.36,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So if you know this leaf area index,

199
0:11:40.32,000 --> 0:11:45,000
you essentially have a measure of how much photosynthesis is possible in every plant,

200
0:11:45.8,000 --> 0:11:47,000
which again tells you how healthy each plant is.

201
0:11:49.52,000 --> 0:11:53,000
By combining visual and infrared information,

202
0:11:53.76,000 --> 0:11:56,000
we can also compute indices such as NDVI.

203
0:11:57.08,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And in this particular case, you can essentially see

204
0:11:59.92,000 --> 0:12:02,000
there are some crops that are not doing as well as other crops.

205
0:12:02.96,000 --> 0:12:06,000
This is easily discernible from imagery,

206
0:12:07.04,000 --> 0:12:09,000
not just visual imagery but combining

207
0:12:09.28,000 --> 0:12:11,000
both visual imagery and infrared imagery.

208
0:12:12.08,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And then lastly,

209
0:12:13.44,000 --> 0:12:17,000
one thing we're interested in doing is detecting the early onset of chlorosis --

210
0:12:17.48,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and this is an orange tree --

211
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:21,000
which is essentially seen by yellowing of leaves.

212
0:12:21.88,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But robots flying overhead can easily spot this autonomously

213
0:12:25.8,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and then report to the farmer that he or she has a problem

214
0:12:28.76,000 --> 0:12:29,000
in this section of the orchard.

215
0:12:30.8,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Systems like this can really help,

216
0:12:33.52,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and we're projecting yields that can improve by about ten percent

217
0:12:39.36,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and, more importantly, decrease the amount of inputs such as water

218
0:12:42.6,000 --> 0:12:45,000
by 25 percent by using aerial robot swarms.

219
0:12:47.2,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Lastly, I want you to applaud the people who actually create the future,

220
0:12:52.96,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Yash Mulgaonkar, Sikang Liu and Giuseppe Loianno,

221
0:12:57.92,000 --> 0:13:,000
who are responsible for the three demonstrations that you saw.

222
0:13:01.44,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Thank you.

223
0:13:02.64,000 --> 0:13:07,000
(Applause)

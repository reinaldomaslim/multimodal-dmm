1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Just a moment ago,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
my daughter Rebecca texted me for good luck.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Her text said,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
"Mom, you will rock."

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I love this.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Getting that text

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
was like getting a hug.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And so there you have it.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I embody

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the central paradox.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I'm a woman

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
who loves getting texts

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
who's going to tell you

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that too many of them can be a problem.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Actually that reminder of my daughter

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
brings me to the beginning of my story.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
1996, when I gave my first TEDTalk,

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
Rebecca was five years old

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and she was sitting right there

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in the front row.

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I had just written a book

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that celebrated our life on the internet

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and I was about to be on the cover

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
of Wired magazine.

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
In those heady days,

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
we were experimenting

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
with chat rooms and online virtual communities.

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
We were exploring different aspects of ourselves.

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And then we unplugged.

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I was excited.

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And, as a psychologist, what excited me most

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
was the idea

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that we would use what we learned in the virtual world

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
about ourselves, about our identity,

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to live better lives in the real world.

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Now fast-forward to 2012.

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I'm back here on the TED stage again.

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
My daughter's 20. She's a college student.

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
She sleeps with her cellphone,

40
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
so do I.

41
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
And I've just written a new book,

42
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but this time it's not one

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that will get me on the cover

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
of Wired magazine.

45
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So what happened?

46
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I'm still excited by technology,

47
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
but I believe,

48
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and I'm here to make the case,

49
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that we're letting it take us places

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that we don't want to go.

51
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Over the past 15 years,

52
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I've studied technologies of mobile communication

53
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people,

54
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
young and old,

55
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
about their plugged in lives.

56
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And what I've found

57
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
is that our little devices,

58
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
those little devices in our pockets,

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
are so psychologically powerful

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that they don't only change what we do,

61
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
they change who we are.

62
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Some of the things we do now with our devices

63
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
are things that, only a few years ago,

64
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
we would have found odd

65
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
or disturbing,

66
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but they've quickly come to seem familiar,

67
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
just how we do things.

68
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So just to take some quick examples:

69
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
People text or do email

70
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
during corporate board meetings.

71
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
They text and shop and go on Facebook

72
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
during classes, during presentations,

73
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
actually during all meetings.

74
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
People talk to me about the important new skill

75
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
of making eye contact

76
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
while you're texting.

77
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
People explain to me

79
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that it's hard, but that it can be done.

80
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Parents text and do email

81
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
at breakfast and at dinner

82
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
while their children complain

83
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
about not having their parents' full attention.

84
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
But then these same children

85
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
deny each other their full attention.

86
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
This is a recent shot

87
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
of my daughter and her friends

88
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
being together

89
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
while not being together.

90
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And we even text at funerals.

91
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I study this.

92
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
We remove ourselves

93
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
from our grief or from our revery

94
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and we go into our phones.

95
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Why does this matter?

96
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It matters to me

97
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
because I think we're setting ourselves up for trouble --

98
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
trouble certainly

99
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
in how we relate to each other,

100
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but also trouble

101
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
in how we relate to ourselves

102
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and our capacity for self-reflection.

103
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We're getting used to a new way

104
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
of being alone together.

105
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
People want to be with each other,

106
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
but also elsewhere --

107
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
connected to all the different places they want to be.

108
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
People want to customize their lives.

109
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
They want to go in and out of all the places they are

110
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
because the thing that matters most to them

111
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
is control over where they put their attention.

112
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So you want to go to that board meeting,

113
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
but you only want to pay attention

114
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to the bits that interest you.

115
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And some people think that's a good thing.

116
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But you can end up

117
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
hiding from each other,

118
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
even as we're all constantly connected to each other.

119
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
A 50-year-old business man

120
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
lamented to me

121
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that he feels he doesn't have colleagues anymore at work.

122
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
When he goes to work, he doesn't stop by to talk to anybody,

123
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
he doesn't call.

124
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And he says he doesn't want to interrupt his colleagues

125
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
because, he says, "They're too busy on their email."

126
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
But then he stops himself

127
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and he says, "You know, I'm not telling you the truth.

128
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I'm the one who doesn't want to be interrupted.

129
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I think I should want to,

130
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
but actually I'd rather just do things on my Blackberry."

131
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Across the generations,

132
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I see that people can't get enough of each other,

133
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
if and only if

134
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
they can have each other at a distance,

135
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
in amounts they can control.

136
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I call it the Goldilocks effect:

137
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
not too close, not too far,

138
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
just right.

139
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But what might feel just right

140
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
for that middle-aged executive

141
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
can be a problem for an adolescent

142
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
who needs to develop face-to-face relationships.

143
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
An 18-year-old boy

144
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
who uses texting for almost everything

145
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
says to me wistfully,

146
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
"Someday, someday,

147
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
but certainly not now,

148
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I'd like to learn how to have a conversation."

149
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
When I ask people

150
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
"What's wrong with having a conversation?"

151
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
People say, "I'll tell you what's wrong with having a conversation.

152
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It takes place in real time

153
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and you can't control what you're going to say."

154
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So that's the bottom line.

155
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Texting, email, posting,

156
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
all of these things

157
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
let us present the self as we want to be.

158
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We get to edit,

159
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and that means we get to delete,

160
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
and that means we get to retouch,

161
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
the face, the voice,

162
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
the flesh, the body --

163
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
not too little, not too much,

164
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
just right.

165
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Human relationships

166
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
are rich and they're messy

167
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and they're demanding.

168
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And we clean them up with technology.

169
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And when we do,

170
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
one of the things that can happen

171
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
is that we sacrifice conversation

172
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
for mere connection.

173
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
We short-change ourselves.

174
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And over time,

175
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
we seem to forget this,

176
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
or we seem to stop caring.

177
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I was caught off guard

178
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
when Stephen Colbert

179
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
asked me a profound question,

180
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
a profound question.

181
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
He said, "Don't all those little tweets,

182
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
don't all those little sips

183
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
of online communication,

184
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
add up to one big gulp

185
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
of real conversation?"

186
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
My answer was no,

187
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
they don't add up.

188
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Connecting in sips may work

189
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
for gathering discrete bits of information,

190
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
they may work for saying, "I'm thinking about you,"

191
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
or even for saying, "I love you," --

192
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I mean, look at how I felt

193
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
when I got that text from my daughter --

194
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
but they don't really work

195
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
for learning about each other,

196
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
for really coming to know and understand each other.

197
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And we use conversations with each other

198
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to learn how to have conversations

199
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
with ourselves.

200
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So a flight from conversation

201
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
can really matter

202
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
because it can compromise

203
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
our capacity for self-reflection.

204
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
For kids growing up,

205
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that skill is the bedrock of development.

206
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Over and over I hear,

207
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
"I would rather text than talk."

208
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And what I'm seeing

209
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
is that people get so used to being short-changed

210
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
out of real conversation,

211
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
so used to getting by with less,

212
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that they've become almost willing

213
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to dispense with people altogether.

214
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So for example,

215
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
many people share with me this wish,

216
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that some day a more advanced version of Siri,

217
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
the digital assistant on Apple's iPhone,

218
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
will be more like a best friend,

219
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
someone who will listen

220
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
when others won't.

221
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I believe this wish

222
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
reflects a painful truth

223
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that I've learned in the past 15 years.

224
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
That feeling that no one is listening to me

225
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
is very important

226
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
in our relationships with technology.

227
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
That's why it's so appealing

228
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
to have a Facebook page

229
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
or a Twitter feed --

230
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
so many automatic listeners.

231
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And the feeling that no one is listening to me

232
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
make us want to spend time

233
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
with machines that seem to care about us.

234
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We're developing robots,

235
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
they call them sociable robots,

236
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
that are specifically designed to be companions --

237
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to the elderly,

238
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to our children,

239
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
to us.

240
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Have we so lost confidence

241
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that we will be there for each other?

242
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
During my research

243
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I worked in nursing homes,

244
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and I brought in these sociable robots

245
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that were designed to give the elderly

246
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
the feeling that they were understood.

247
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And one day I came in

248
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and a woman who had lost a child

249
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
was talking to a robot

250
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
in the shape of a baby seal.

251
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
It seemed to be looking in her eyes.

252
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It seemed to be following the conversation.

253
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
It comforted her.

254
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
And many people found this amazing.

255
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
But that woman was trying to make sense of her life

256
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
with a machine that had no experience

257
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
of the arc of a human life.

258
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
That robot put on a great show.

259
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And we're vulnerable.

260
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
People experience pretend empathy

261
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
as though it were the real thing.

262
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So during that moment

263
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
when that woman

264
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
was experiencing that pretend empathy,

265
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I was thinking, "That robot can't empathize.

266
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
It doesn't face death.

267
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
It doesn't know life."

268
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And as that woman took comfort

269
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
in her robot companion,

270
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I didn't find it amazing;

271
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I found it one of the most wrenching, complicated moments

272
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
in my 15 years of work.

273
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
But when I stepped back,

274
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I felt myself

275
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
at the cold, hard center

276
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
of a perfect storm.

277
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
We expect more from technology

278
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and less from each other.

279
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And I ask myself,

280
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
"Why have things come to this?"

281
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And I believe it's because

282
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
technology appeals to us most

283
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
where we are most vulnerable.

284
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And we are vulnerable.

285
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
We're lonely,

286
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
but we're afraid of intimacy.

287
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And so from social networks to sociable robots,

288
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
we're designing technologies

289
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
that will give us the illusion of companionship

290
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
without the demands of friendship.

291
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
We turn to technology to help us feel connected

292
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
in ways we can comfortably control.

293
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
But we're not so comfortable.

294
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
We are not so much in control.

295
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
These days, those phones in our pockets

296
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
are changing our minds and hearts

297
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
because they offer us

298
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
three gratifying fantasies.

299
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
One, that we can put our attention

300
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
wherever we want it to be;

301
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
two, that we will always be heard;

302
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and three, that we will never have to be alone.

303
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And that third idea,

304
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
that we will never have to be alone,

305
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
is central to changing our psyches.

306
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Because the moment that people are alone,

307
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
even for a few seconds,

308
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
they become anxious, they panic, they fidget,

309
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
they reach for a device.

310
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Just think of people at a checkout line

311
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
or at a red light.

312
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Being alone feels like a problem that needs to be solved.

313
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And so people try to solve it by connecting.

314
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
But here, connection

315
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
is more like a symptom than a cure.

316
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
It expresses, but it doesn't solve,

317
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
an underlying problem.

318
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
But more than a symptom,

319
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
constant connection is changing

320
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
the way people think of themselves.

321
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
It's shaping a new way of being.

322
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
The best way to describe it is,

323
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
I share therefore I am.

324
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
We use technology to define ourselves

325
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
by sharing our thoughts and feelings

326
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
even as we're having them.

327
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
So before it was:

328
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
I have a feeling,

329
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
I want to make a call.

330
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Now it's: I want to have a feeling,

331
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I need to send a text.

332
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
The problem with this new regime

333
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
of "I share therefore I am"

334
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
is that, if we don't have connection,

335
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
we don't feel like ourselves.

336
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
We almost don't feel ourselves.

337
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
So what do we do? We connect more and more.

338
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
But in the process,

339
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
we set ourselves up to be isolated.

340
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
How do you get from connection to isolation?

341
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
You end up isolated

342
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
if you don't cultivate the capacity for solitude,

343
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
the ability to be separate,

344
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
to gather yourself.

345
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Solitude is where you find yourself

346
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
so that you can reach out to other people

347
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and form real attachments.

348
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
When we don't have the capacity for solitude,

349
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
we turn to other people in order to feel less anxious

350
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
or in order to feel alive.

351
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
When this happens,

352
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
we're not able to appreciate who they are.

353
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
It's as though we're using them

354
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
as spare parts

355
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
to support our fragile sense of self.

356
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
We slip into thinking that always being connected

357
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
is going to make us feel less alone.

358
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
But we're at risk,

359
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
because actually it's the opposite that's true.

360
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
If we're not able to be alone,

361
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
we're going to be more lonely.

362
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And if we don't teach our children to be alone,

363
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
they're only going to know

364
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
how to be lonely.

365
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
When I spoke at TED in 1996,

366
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
reporting on my studies

367
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
of the early virtual communities,

368
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
I said, "Those who make the most

369
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
of their lives on the screen

370
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
come to it in a spirit of self-reflection."

371
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And that's what I'm calling for here, now:

372
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
reflection and, more than that, a conversation

373
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
about where our current use of technology

374
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
may be taking us,

375
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
what it might be costing us.

376
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
We're smitten with technology.

377
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And we're afraid, like young lovers,

378
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
that too much talking might spoil the romance.

379
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
But it's time to talk.

380
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
We grew up with digital technology

381
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and so we see it as all grown up.

382
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
But it's not, it's early days.

383
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
There's plenty of time

384
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
for us to reconsider how we use it,

385
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
how we build it.

386
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
I'm not suggesting

387
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
that we turn away from our devices,

388
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
just that we develop a more self-aware relationship

389
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
with them, with each other

390
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and with ourselves.

391
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
I see some first steps.

392
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Start thinking of solitude

393
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
as a good thing.

394
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Make room for it.

395
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Find ways to demonstrate this

396
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
as a value to your children.

397
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Create sacred spaces at home --

398
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
the kitchen, the dining room --

399
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and reclaim them for conversation.

400
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Do the same thing at work.

401
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
At work, we're so busy communicating

402
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
that we often don't have time to think,

403
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
we don't have time to talk,

404
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
about the things that really matter.

405
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Change that.

406
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Most important, we all really need to listen to each other,

407
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
including to the boring bits.

408
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Because it's when we stumble

409
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
or hesitate or lose our words

410
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
that we reveal ourselves to each other.

411
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Technology is making a bid

412
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
to redefine human connection --

413
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
how we care for each other,

414
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
how we care for ourselves --

415
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
but it's also giving us the opportunity

416
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
to affirm our values

417
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
and our direction.

418
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
I'm optimistic.

419
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
We have everything we need to start.

420
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
We have each other.

421
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
And we have the greatest chance of success

422
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
if we recognize our vulnerability.

423
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
That we listen

424
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
when technology says

425
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
it will take something complicated

426
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
and promises something simpler.

427
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
So in my work,

428
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
I hear that life is hard,

429
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
relationships are filled with risk.

430
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
And then there's technology --

431
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
simpler, hopeful,

432
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
optimistic, ever-young.

433
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
It's like calling in the cavalry.

434
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
An ad campaign promises

435
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
that online and with avatars,

436
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
you can "Finally, love your friends

437
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
love your body, love your life,

438
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
online and with avatars."

439
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
We're drawn to virtual romance,

440
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
to computer games that seem like worlds,

441
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
to the idea that robots, robots,

442
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
will someday be our true companions.

443
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
We spend an evening on the social network

444
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
instead of going to the pub with friends.

445
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
But our fantasies of substitution

446
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
have cost us.

447
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:07,000
Now we all need to focus

448
0:19:07.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
on the many, many ways

449
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:11,000
technology can lead us back

450
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:14,000
to our real lives, our own bodies,

451
0:19:14.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
our own communities,

452
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
our own politics,

453
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
our own planet.

454
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:22,000
They need us.

455
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:24,000
Let's talk about

456
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
how we can use digital technology,

457
0:19:27.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
the technology of our dreams,

458
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:32,000
to make this life

459
0:19:32.26,000 --> 0:19:34,000
the life we can love.

460
0:19:34.26,000 --> 0:19:36,000
Thank you.

461
0:19:36.26,000 --> 0:19:42,000
(Applause)

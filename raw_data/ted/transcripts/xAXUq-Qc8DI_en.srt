1
0:00:12.809,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Have you ever heard of typosquatting?

2
0:00:15.24,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Well, typosquatting is where companies like Google

3
0:00:18,000 --> 0:00:21,000
post advertisements on websites that are commonly miskeyed,

4
0:00:21.48,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and then they sit back and rake in millions

5
0:00:23.6,000 --> 0:00:26,000
banking on the fact that you're visiting something like gmale.com

6
0:00:27.12,000 --> 0:00:28,000
or mikerowesoft.com.

7
0:00:28.72,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:29.76,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It just seems kind of silly, doesn't it?

9
0:00:33.52,000 --> 0:00:34,000
How about this?

10
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:37,000
On February 28, an engineer at Amazon

11
0:00:37.4,000 --> 0:00:39,000
made a similar, seemingly small key error.

12
0:00:40.08,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Only I say seemingly small

13
0:00:41.6,000 --> 0:00:44,000
because this one little typo on Amazon's supercode

14
0:00:44.68,000 --> 0:00:45,000
produced a massive internet slowdown

15
0:00:46.44,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that cost the company over 160 million dollars

16
0:00:49.48,000 --> 0:00:5,000
in the span of just four hours.

17
0:00:52.36,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But this is actually really scary.

18
0:00:55.04,000 --> 0:00:57,000
You see, recently, an employee at the New England Compound,

19
0:00:57.88,000 --> 0:00:58,000
which is a pharmaceutical manufacturer,

20
0:00:59.84,000 --> 0:01:,000
didn't clean a lab properly

21
0:01:01.56,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and now 76 people have died

22
0:01:04.04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and 700 more have contracted meningitis.

23
0:01:06.84,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I mean, these examples are crazy, right?

24
0:01:09.96,000 --> 0:01:11,000
When did we come to live in a world where these types of typos,

25
0:01:12.96,000 --> 0:01:15,000
common errors, this do-your-best attitude or just good enough was acceptable?

26
0:01:17.319,000 --> 0:01:2,000
At some point, we've stopped valuing perfection,

27
0:01:20.68,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and now, these are the type of results that we get.

28
0:01:24.04,000 --> 0:01:27,000
You see, I think that we should all seek perfection,

29
0:01:27.64,000 --> 0:01:28,000
all the time,

30
0:01:29.12,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and I think we need to get to it quick.

31
0:01:31.84,000 --> 0:01:32,000
You see, I run a training facility

32
0:01:33.52,000 --> 0:01:36,000
where I'm responsible for the education of professional delivery drivers,

33
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and in my line of work,

34
0:01:38.28,000 --> 0:01:41,000
we have a unique understanding of the cost of failure,

35
0:01:41.4,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the cost of just 99 percent,

36
0:01:43.88,000 --> 0:01:45,000
because in the world of professional driving,

37
0:01:46.04,000 --> 0:01:48,000
just 99 percent of the job means somebody dies.

38
0:01:49.64,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Look, a hundred people die every day

39
0:01:52.28,000 --> 0:01:53,000
due to vehicular crashes.

40
0:01:54.08,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Think about that for a second.

41
0:01:55.84,000 --> 0:01:57,000
That's like the equivalent of four commercial airliners

42
0:01:58.48,000 --> 0:01:59,000
crashing every week,

43
0:01:59.76,000 --> 0:02:02,000
yet we still can't convince ourselves to pay perfect attention behind the wheel.

44
0:02:03.6,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So I teach my drivers to value perfection.

45
0:02:06.72,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It's why I have them memorize

46
0:02:08.36,000 --> 0:02:11,000
our 131-word defensive driving program

47
0:02:11.48,000 --> 0:02:12,000
perfectly,

48
0:02:12.72,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and then I have them rewrite it.

49
0:02:14.32,000 --> 0:02:17,000
One wrong word, one misspelled word, one missing comma, it's a failed test.

50
0:02:18.96,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It's why I do uniform inspections daily.

51
0:02:21.44,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Undershirts are white or brown only,

52
0:02:23.2,000 --> 0:02:25,000
shoes are black or brown polished leather

53
0:02:25.28,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and frankly, don't come to my class wrinkled and expect me to let you stay.

54
0:02:28.88,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It's why I insist that my drivers are on time.

55
0:02:31.6,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Don't be late, not to class, not to break, not to lunch.

56
0:02:34.4,000 --> 0:02:36,000
When you're supposed to be somewhere, be there.

57
0:02:37.68,000 --> 0:02:4,000
You see, I do this so that my students understand

58
0:02:40.84,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that when I'm training them to drive a car and I say,

59
0:02:43.44,000 --> 0:02:44,000
"Clear every intersection,"

60
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
they understand that I mean every traffic signal, every cross street,

61
0:02:49.32,000 --> 0:02:52,000
every side street, every parking lot, every dirt road, every crosswalk,

62
0:02:53.32,000 --> 0:02:55,000
every intersection without fail.

63
0:02:56.64,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Now, new students will often ask me

64
0:02:59.4,000 --> 0:03:02,000
why my class is so difficult, strict, or uniform,

65
0:03:03.08,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and the answer is simple.

66
0:03:04.68,000 --> 0:03:07,000
You see, perfectionism is an attitude developed in the small things

67
0:03:08.28,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and then applied to the larger job.

68
0:03:10.32,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So basically, if you can't get the little things right,

69
0:03:12.96,000 --> 0:03:13,000
you're going to fail when it counts,

70
0:03:14.72,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and when you're driving a car, it counts.

71
0:03:16.72,000 --> 0:03:17,000
A car traveling at 55 miles an hour

72
0:03:18.72,000 --> 0:03:2,000
covers the length of an American football field

73
0:03:20.96,000 --> 0:03:22,000
in just under four and a half seconds,

74
0:03:23.04,000 --> 0:03:25,000
but just so happens to be the same amount of time

75
0:03:25.4,000 --> 0:03:27,000
it takes the average person to check a text message.

76
0:03:27.88,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So I don't allow my drivers to lose focus,

77
0:03:30.08,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and I don't accept anything less than perfection out of them.

78
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And you know what?

79
0:03:34.28,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I'm tired of everybody else accepting 99 percent as good enough.

80
0:03:37.64,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I mean, being less than perfect has real consequences, doesn't it?

81
0:03:41.4,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Think about it.

82
0:03:42.84,000 --> 0:03:46,000
If the makers of our credit cards were only 99.9 percent effective,

83
0:03:47.48,000 --> 0:03:49,000
there would be over a million cards in circulation today

84
0:03:50.24,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that had the wrong information on the magnetic strip on the back.

85
0:03:53.4,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Or, if the Webster's Dictionary was only 99.9 percent accurate,

86
0:03:57.84,000 --> 0:03:59,000
it would have 470 misspelled words in it.

87
0:04:01.12,000 --> 0:04:02,000
How about this?

88
0:04:02.36,000 --> 0:04:05,000
If our doctors were only 99.9 percent correct,

89
0:04:05.84,000 --> 0:04:1,000
then every year, 4,453,000 prescriptions would be written incorrectly,

90
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and probably even scarier,

91
0:04:12.52,000 --> 0:04:15,000
11 newborns would be given to the wrong parents every day

92
0:04:15.8,000 --> 0:04:16,000
in the United States.

93
0:04:17.2,000 --> 0:04:18,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:19.12,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And those are just the odds, thank you.

95
0:04:21.04,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:22.32,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The reality is that the US government crashed a 1.4-billion-dollar aircraft

97
0:04:27.84,000 --> 0:04:29,000
because the maintenance crew only did 99 percent of their job.

98
0:04:31.44,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Someone forgot to check a sensor.

99
0:04:33.44,000 --> 0:04:35,000
The reality is that 16 people are now dead,

100
0:04:36.32,000 --> 0:04:38,000
180 have now been injured,

101
0:04:38.36,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and 34 million cars are being recalled

102
0:04:41.28,000 --> 0:04:45,000
because the producers of a car airbag produced and distributed a product

103
0:04:45.68,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that they thought was, you know, good enough.

104
0:04:49.04,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The reality is that medical errors

105
0:04:50.84,000 --> 0:04:52,000
are now the third leading cause of death in America.

106
0:04:53.4,000 --> 0:04:55,000
250,000 people die each year

107
0:04:55.68,000 --> 0:04:58,000
because somebody who probably thought they were doing their job good enough

108
0:04:59.24,000 --> 0:05:,000
messed up.

109
0:05:01.04,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And you don't believe me?

110
0:05:02.6,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Well, I can certainly understand why.

111
0:05:04.44,000 --> 0:05:06,000
You see, it's hard for us to believe anything these days

112
0:05:07.12,000 --> 0:05:09,000
when less than 50 percent of what news pundits say

113
0:05:09.52,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is actually grounded in fact.

114
0:05:10.96,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Laughter)

115
0:05:12.4,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So it comes down to this:

116
0:05:14.28,000 --> 0:05:16,000
trying our best is not good enough.

117
0:05:18.08,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So how do we change?

118
0:05:21.08,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We seek perfection

119
0:05:23.24,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and settle for nothing less.

120
0:05:25.56,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Now, I know. I need to give you a minute on that,

121
0:05:27.92,000 --> 0:05:29,000
because I know what you've been told.

122
0:05:29.96,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It probably goes something like, perfection is impossible for humans,

123
0:05:33.24,000 --> 0:05:36,000
so therefore, seeking perfection will not only ruin your self-esteem

124
0:05:36.48,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but it will render you a failure.

125
0:05:38.56,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But there's the irony.

126
0:05:40.4,000 --> 0:05:42,000
See, today we're all so afraid of that word failure,

127
0:05:42.88,000 --> 0:05:43,000
but the truth is, we need to fail.

128
0:05:44.88,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Failure is a natural stepping stone towards perfection,

129
0:05:48.64,000 --> 0:05:51,000
but at some point, because we became so afraid of that idea of failure

130
0:05:52.44,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and so afraid of that idea of perfection,

131
0:05:55.04,000 --> 0:05:58,000
we dismissed it because of what might happen to our egos when we fall short.

132
0:05:59.04,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I mean, do you really think that failure's going to ruin you?

133
0:06:02.36,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Or is that just the easy answer that gets us slow websites,

134
0:06:05.44,000 --> 0:06:07,000
scary healthcare and dangerous roads?

135
0:06:07.92,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I mean, are you ready to make perfection the bad guy in all this?

136
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Look, failure and imperfection are basically the same thing.

137
0:06:15.04,000 --> 0:06:17,000
We all know that imperfection exists all around us.

138
0:06:17.6,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Nothing and nobody is perfect.

139
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But at some point, because it was too difficult or too painful,

140
0:06:23.28,000 --> 0:06:26,000
we decided to dismiss our natural ability to deal with failure

141
0:06:26.48,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and replace it with a lower acceptance level.

142
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And now we're all forced to sit back

143
0:06:30.76,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and just accept this new norm or good-enough attitude

144
0:06:34.44,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and the results that come with it.

145
0:06:39.72,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So even with all that said,

146
0:06:42.52,000 --> 0:06:44,000
people will still tell me, you know,

147
0:06:45.28,000 --> 0:06:47,000
"Didn't the medical staff, the maintenance crew, the engineer,

148
0:06:48.24,000 --> 0:06:5,000
didn't they try their best, and isn't that good enough?"

149
0:06:50.91,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Well, truthfully, not for me and especially not in these examples.

150
0:06:54.96,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Yeah, but, you know, trying to be perfect is so stressful, right?

151
0:06:58.68,000 --> 0:07:,000
And, you know, Oprah talked about it, universities study it,

152
0:07:01.56,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I bet your high school counselor even warned you about it.

153
0:07:04.32,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Stress is bad for us, isn't it?

154
0:07:05.88,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Well, maybe,

155
0:07:07.12,000 --> 0:07:09,000
but to say that seeking perfection is too stressful

156
0:07:09.56,000 --> 0:07:12,000
is like saying that exercise is too exhausting.

157
0:07:12.76,000 --> 0:07:15,000
In both cases, if you want the results, you've got to endure the pain.

158
0:07:16.24,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So truthfully, saying that seeking perfection is too stressful

159
0:07:19.2,000 --> 0:07:2,000
is just an excuse to be lazy.

160
0:07:21.28,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But here's the really scary part.

161
0:07:23.8,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Today, doctors, therapists

162
0:07:26.28,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and the nearly 10-billion- dollar-a-year self-help industry

163
0:07:29.44,000 --> 0:07:32,000
are all advocating against the idea of perfection

164
0:07:32.52,000 --> 0:07:34,000
under this guise that somehow not trying to be perfect

165
0:07:35.4,000 --> 0:07:37,000
will save your self-esteem and protect your ego.

166
0:07:38.2,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But, see, it's not working,

167
0:07:39.8,000 --> 0:07:42,000
because the self-help industry today has a higher recidivism rate

168
0:07:43.12,000 --> 0:07:46,000
because it's more focused on teaching you how to accept being a failure

169
0:07:46.48,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and lower your acceptance level

170
0:07:48.04,000 --> 0:07:5,000
than it is about pushing you to be perfect.

171
0:07:50.48,000 --> 0:07:54,000
See, these doctors, therapists and self-help gurus

172
0:07:55.08,000 --> 0:07:57,000
are all focused on a symptom and not the illness.

173
0:07:58.44,000 --> 0:08:02,000
The true illness in our society today is our unwillingness to confront failure.

174
0:08:02.8,000 --> 0:08:04,000
See, we're more comfortable resting on our efforts

175
0:08:05.2,000 --> 0:08:06,000
than we are with focusing on our results.

176
0:08:07.2,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Like at Dublin Jerome High School in Ohio,

177
0:08:10.08,000 --> 0:08:13,000
where they name 30 percent of a graduating class valedictorian.

178
0:08:14.76,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I mean, come on, right?

179
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Somebody had the highest GPA.

180
0:08:18.04,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I guarantee you it wasn't a 72-way tie.

181
0:08:20.76,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Laughter)

182
0:08:21.8,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But, see, we're more comfortable offering up an equal outcome

183
0:08:24.72,000 --> 0:08:27,000
than we are with confronting the failure, the loser or the underachiever.

184
0:08:28.24,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And when everybody gets a prize, everybody advances,

185
0:08:30.72,000 --> 0:08:32,000
or everybody gets a pay raise despite results,

186
0:08:32.92,000 --> 0:08:34,000
the perfectionist in all of us is left to wonder,

187
0:08:35.28,000 --> 0:08:36,000
what do I have to do to get better?

188
0:08:37.08,000 --> 0:08:38,000
How do I raise above the crowd?

189
0:08:39.32,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And see, if we continue to cultivate this culture,

190
0:08:42.24,000 --> 0:08:45,000
where nobody fails or nobody is told that they will fail,

191
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:48,000
then nobody's going to reach their potential, either.

192
0:08:48.64,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Failure and loss are necessary for success.

193
0:08:52.08,000 --> 0:08:54,000
It's the acceptance of failure that's not.

194
0:08:55.44,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Michelangelo is credited with saying that the greatest danger for most of us

195
0:08:59.08,000 --> 0:09:01,000
is not that our aim is too high and we miss it,

196
0:09:01.32,000 --> 0:09:03,000
but it's too low and we reach it.

197
0:09:03.68,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Failure should be a motivating force,

198
0:09:05.52,000 --> 0:09:07,000
not some type of pathetic excuse to give up.

199
0:09:08.24,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So I have an idea.

200
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Instead of defining perfectionism as a destructive intolerance for failure,

201
0:09:16.28,000 --> 0:09:18,000
why don't we try giving it a new definition?

202
0:09:18.84,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Why don't we try defining perfectionism as a willingness to do what is difficult

203
0:09:22.88,000 --> 0:09:23,000
to achieve what is right?

204
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
You see, then we can agree

205
0:09:26.72,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that failure is a good thing in our quest for perfection,

206
0:09:29.44,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and when we seek perfection without fear of failure,

207
0:09:31.92,000 --> 0:09:32,000
just think about what we can accomplish.

208
0:09:33.88,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Like NBA superstar Steph Curry:

209
0:09:37.12,000 --> 0:09:4,000
he hit 77 three-point shots in a row.

210
0:09:40.4,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Think about that.

211
0:09:41.64,000 --> 0:09:44,000
The guy was able to accurately deliver a nine-and-a-half inch ball

212
0:09:44.8,000 --> 0:09:46,000
through an 18-inch rim that's suspended 10 feet in the air

213
0:09:47.56,000 --> 0:09:48,000
from nearly 24 feet away

214
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
almost 80 times without failure.

215
0:09:52.32,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Or like the computer programmers

216
0:09:55.28,000 --> 0:09:58,000
at the aerospace giant Lockheed Martin,

217
0:09:58.52,000 --> 0:09:59,000
who have now written a program

218
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:03,000
that uses 420,000 lines of near-flawless code

219
0:10:03.68,000 --> 0:10:06,000
to control every aspect of igniting four million pounds of rocket fuel

220
0:10:07.56,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and putting a 120-ton spaceship into orbit.

221
0:10:10.6,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Or maybe like the researchers

222
0:10:12.72,000 --> 0:10:15,000
at the Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri,

223
0:10:15.84,000 --> 0:10:16,000
who have now developed a device

224
0:10:17.44,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that can complete human genome coding in just 26 hours.

225
0:10:21.32,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So this device is able to diagnose genetic diseases

226
0:10:24.56,000 --> 0:10:26,000
in babies and newborns sooner,

227
0:10:27.44,000 --> 0:10:29,000
giving doctors an opportunity to start treatments earlier

228
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and potentially save the baby's life.

229
0:10:32.36,000 --> 0:10:34,000
See, that's what happens when we seek perfection.

230
0:10:35.24,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So maybe we should be more like the professional athlete,

231
0:10:38.24,000 --> 0:10:4,000
or we should be more like that tireless programmer,

232
0:10:40.68,000 --> 0:10:41,000
or like that passionate researcher.

233
0:10:42.52,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Then we could stop fearing failure

234
0:10:44.44,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and we could stop living in a world filled with the consequences

235
0:10:47.48,000 --> 0:10:48,000
of good enough.

236
0:10:48.72,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Thank you.

237
0:10:49.96,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:12.984,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Tell your daughters of this year,

3
0:00:15.28,000 --> 0:00:17,000
how we woke needing coffee

4
0:00:17.4,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but discovered instead cadavers strewn about our morning papers,

5
0:00:21.24,000 --> 0:00:25,000
waterlogged facsimiles of our sisters, spouses, small children.

6
0:00:26.6,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Say to your baby of this year when she asks, as she certainly should,

7
0:00:30.24,000 --> 0:00:31,000
tell her it was too late coming.

8
0:00:31.84,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Admit even in the year we leased freedom, we didn't own it outright.

9
0:00:36.32,000 --> 0:00:38,000
There were still laws for every way we used our privates

10
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
while they pawed at the soft folds of us,

11
0:00:41.68,000 --> 0:00:43,000
grabbed with no concern for consent,

12
0:00:44.439,000 --> 0:00:46,000
no laws made for the men that enforced them.

13
0:00:47.08,000 --> 0:00:49,000
We were trained to dodge,

14
0:00:49.52,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to wait, to cower and cover,

15
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
to wait more, still, wait.

16
0:00:55.08,000 --> 0:00:56,000
We were told to be silent.

17
0:00:57.44,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But speak to your girls of this wartime,

18
0:00:59.72,000 --> 0:01:01,000
a year preceded by a score of the same,

19
0:01:02.32,000 --> 0:01:04,000
so as in two decades before,

20
0:01:04.6,000 --> 0:01:05,000
we wiped our eyes,

21
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
laced caskets with flags,

22
0:01:08.08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
evacuated the crime scene of the club,

23
0:01:10.28,000 --> 0:01:11,000
caterwauled in the street,

24
0:01:11.6,000 --> 0:01:14,000
laid our bodies on the concrete against the outlines of our fallen,

25
0:01:14.92,000 --> 0:01:15,000
cried, "Of course we mattered,"

26
0:01:16.879,000 --> 0:01:17,000
chanted for our disappeared.

27
0:01:18.28,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The women wept this year.

28
0:01:20.44,000 --> 0:01:21,000
They did.

29
0:01:21.68,000 --> 0:01:23,000
In the same year, we were ready.

30
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The year we lost our inhibition and moved with courageous abandon

31
0:01:27.28,000 --> 0:01:29,000
was also the year we stared down barrels,

32
0:01:29.8,000 --> 0:01:31,000
sang of cranes in skies, ducked and parried,

33
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
caught gold in hijab, collected death threats,

34
0:01:34.64,000 --> 0:01:35,000
knew ourselves as patriots,

35
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:39,000
said, "We're 35 now, time we settled down and found a running mate,"

36
0:01:39.24,000 --> 0:01:42,000
made road maps for infant joy, shamed nothing but fear,

37
0:01:42.4,000 --> 0:01:44,000
called ourselves fat and meant, of course,

38
0:01:44.68,000 --> 0:01:45,000
impeccable.

39
0:01:45.92,000 --> 0:01:46,000
This year, we were women,

40
0:01:47.88,000 --> 0:01:48,000
not brides or trinkets,

41
0:01:49.68,000 --> 0:01:5,000
not an off-brand gender,

42
0:01:51.2,000 --> 0:01:53,000
not a concession, but women.

43
0:01:53.36,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Instruct your babies.

44
0:01:54.68,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Remind them that the year has passed to be docile or small.

45
0:01:58.08,000 --> 0:02:,000
Some of us said for the first time that we were women,

46
0:02:00.72,000 --> 0:02:02,000
took this oath of solidarity seriously.

47
0:02:03.12,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Some of us bore children and some of us did not,

48
0:02:05.4,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and none of us questioned whether that made us real

49
0:02:07.84,000 --> 0:02:08,000
or appropriate or true.

50
0:02:09.64,000 --> 0:02:11,000
When she asks you of this year,

51
0:02:11.8,000 --> 0:02:13,000
your daughter, whether your offspring or heir to your triumph,

52
0:02:14.729,000 --> 0:02:17,000
from her comforted side of history teetering towards woman,

53
0:02:17.76,000 --> 0:02:19,000
she will wonder and ask voraciously,

54
0:02:20.08,000 --> 0:02:21,000
though she cannot fathom your sacrifice,

55
0:02:22.039,000 --> 0:02:24,000
she will hold your estimation of it holy,

56
0:02:24.84,000 --> 0:02:26,000
curiously probing, "Where were you?

57
0:02:27.36,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Did you fight? Were you fearful or fearsome?

58
0:02:30.4,000 --> 0:02:31,000
What colored the walls of your regret?

59
0:02:32.28,000 --> 0:02:34,000
What did you do for women in the year it was time?

60
0:02:34.96,000 --> 0:02:36,000
This path you made for me, which bones had to break?

61
0:02:37.88,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Did you do enough, and are you OK, momma?

62
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And are you a hero?"

63
0:02:41.4,000 --> 0:02:43,000
She will ask the difficult questions.

64
0:02:43.84,000 --> 0:02:45,000
She will not care about the arc of your brow,

65
0:02:46.04,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the weight of your clutch.

66
0:02:47.32,000 --> 0:02:48,000
She will not ask of your mentions.

67
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Your daughter, for whom you have already carried so much, wants to know

68
0:02:52.4,000 --> 0:02:55,000
what you brought, what gift, what light did you keep from extinction?

69
0:02:55.92,000 --> 0:02:56,000
When they came for victims in the night,

70
0:02:57.88,000 --> 0:02:59,000
did you sleep through it or were you roused?

71
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:01,000
What was the cost of staying woke?

72
0:03:01.68,000 --> 0:03:04,000
What, in the year we said time's up, what did you do with your privilege?

73
0:03:05.17,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Did you sup on others' squalor?

74
0:03:06.72,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Did you look away or directly into the flame?

75
0:03:08.88,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Did you know your skill or treat it like a liability?

76
0:03:11.44,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Were you fooled by the epithets of "nasty" or "less than"?

77
0:03:14.8,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Did you teach with an open heart or a clenched fist?

78
0:03:17.32,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Where were you?

79
0:03:18.56,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Tell her the truth. Make it your life.

80
0:03:20.44,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Confirm it. Say, "Daughter, I stood there

81
0:03:22.44,000 --> 0:03:24,000
with the moment drawn on my face like a dagger,

82
0:03:24.68,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and flung it back at itself,

83
0:03:26.04,000 --> 0:03:27,000
slicing space for you."

84
0:03:27.48,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Tell her the truth, how you lived in spite of crooked odds.

85
0:03:30.32,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Tell her you were brave,

86
0:03:31.6,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and always, always in the company of courage,

87
0:03:33.96,000 --> 0:03:35,000
mostly the days when you just had yourself.

88
0:03:36.28,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Tell her she was born as you were,

89
0:03:38.28,000 --> 0:03:4,000
as your mothers before, and the sisters beside them,

90
0:03:40.92,000 --> 0:03:42,000
in the age of legends, like always.

91
0:03:43.04,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Tell her she was born just in time,

92
0:03:45.76,000 --> 0:03:46,000
just in time

93
0:03:47.52,000 --> 0:03:48,000
to lead.

94
0:03:48.76,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Applause)

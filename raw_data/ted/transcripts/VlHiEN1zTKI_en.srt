1
0:00:13.72,000 --> 0:00:15,000
When is seeing not believing?

2
0:00:17.12,000 --> 0:00:2,000
A couple years ago, my friend sent me this photo from Ürümqi,

3
0:00:20.68,000 --> 0:00:24,000
which is the capital of Xinjiang province in northwest China.

4
0:00:24.8,000 --> 0:00:27,000
On this particular day, she couldn't believe her eyes.

5
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Checking the quality of the air outside using this app on her iPad,

6
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the numbers were telling her the air quality was good,

7
0:00:36.32,000 --> 0:00:37,000
one on a scale of 500.

8
0:00:38.92,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But when she looked outside, she saw something much different.

9
0:00:42.8,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Yes, those are buildings in the background.

10
0:00:44.92,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But the data were simply not telling the truth

12
0:00:50.12,000 --> 0:00:52,000
of what people were seeing and breathing,

13
0:00:52.56,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and it's because they were failing to measure PM2.5,

14
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
or fine particulate pollution.

15
0:00:58.44,000 --> 0:01:01,000
When PM2.5 levels went off the charts in 2012,

16
0:01:02.36,000 --> 0:01:05,000
or "crazy bad," as the US Embassy once described it in a tweet,

17
0:01:06.36,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Chinese denizens took to social media

18
0:01:08.56,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and they started to question why it was that they were seeing this disconnect

19
0:01:12.24,000 --> 0:01:14,000
between official air quality statistics

20
0:01:14.28,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and what they were seeing and breathing for themselves.

21
0:01:18.4,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Now, this questioning has led

22
0:01:20.56,000 --> 0:01:23,000
to an environmental awakening of sorts in China,

23
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
forcing China's government to tackle its pollution problems.

24
0:01:28.4,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now China has the opportunity to become a global environmental leader.

25
0:01:34.44,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But the picture that I'll paint for you today

26
0:01:36.96,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is one that's mixed.

27
0:01:38.64,000 --> 0:01:4,000
There are some signs that are very promising,

28
0:01:41.4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and there are other trends that are more troubling

29
0:01:43.8,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that warrant closer attention.

30
0:01:45.44,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But now let's go back to the story at hand.

31
0:01:48.36,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I started to witness the beginnings of China's green evolution

32
0:01:51.44,000 --> 0:01:55,000
when I was a PhD student conducting fieldwork in China in 2011.

33
0:01:56.32,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I traveled all across the country seeking answers to the question

34
0:01:59.8,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that I often got myself from the skeptical outsider:

35
0:02:03.32,000 --> 0:02:05,000
What, you mean China is doing something on the environment?

36
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
They have environmental policies?

37
0:02:07.8,000 --> 0:02:08,000
What policies?

38
0:02:09.6,000 --> 0:02:13,000
At that time, PM2.5 data was considered too politically sensitive

39
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and so the government was keeping it secret,

40
0:02:16.72,000 --> 0:02:2,000
but citizens were becoming aware of its harmful human health effects,

41
0:02:21.52,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and they were demanding greater transparency

42
0:02:23.64,000 --> 0:02:24,000
on the part of the government.

43
0:02:25.12,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I actually started to see some of this growing evolution and awareness myself

44
0:02:29.32,000 --> 0:02:3,000
cropping up all over China.

45
0:02:31.68,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Department stores, for example, started to market these air purifiers

46
0:02:35.48,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that could filter out harmful PM2.5.

47
0:02:39.32,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Citizens were also adopting PM2.5 as the title of musical festivals.

48
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:46.48,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And then I went to a golf course in Shenzhen, which is in southern China,

50
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and you can see from this banner, they're advertising a retreat from PM2.5.

51
0:02:55.44,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Golf sub-par, but don't breathe sub-par air.

52
0:02:59.36,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And then Shanghai's Environmental Protection Bureau

53
0:03:01.8,000 --> 0:03:05,000
decided to create a mascot named after the air quality index

54
0:03:06.4,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to better communicate the air quality data to its people.

55
0:03:10.44,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I call her AQI Girl,

56
0:03:12.4,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and her expression and hair color changes depending on the quality of air outside.

57
0:03:17.52,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Five years later and she's still the mostly smiling face

58
0:03:21.2,000 --> 0:03:22,000
of Shanghai's air quality.

59
0:03:23.64,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And then in 2015,

60
0:03:25.36,000 --> 0:03:27,000
former CCTV reporter Chai Jing

61
0:03:27.76,000 --> 0:03:29,000
created this documentary called "Under the Dome."

62
0:03:30.88,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It would be likened to Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring."

63
0:03:34.04,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And much like Rachel Carson

64
0:03:35.88,000 --> 0:03:38,000
brought to attention the fact that pesticides were harming human health,

65
0:03:39.72,000 --> 0:03:42,000
"Under the Dome" stamped into the popular consciousness

66
0:03:43.52,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that air pollution was leading to one million premature deaths

67
0:03:48.04,000 --> 0:03:5,000
every year in China alone.

68
0:03:51.12,000 --> 0:03:52,000
This video garnered

69
0:03:52.4,000 --> 0:03:54,000
more than a hundred million views in a single weekend

70
0:03:55.32,000 --> 0:03:56,000
before China's government,

71
0:03:57.24,000 --> 0:03:59,000
fearing that it might incite some type of social unrest,

72
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
pulled it from the internet.

73
0:04:02.8,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But the damage had already been done.

74
0:04:05.08,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Public outcry over air pollution

75
0:04:07.32,000 --> 0:04:08,000
galvanized China's government,

76
0:04:09.24,000 --> 0:04:11,000
perhaps in an act of self-preservation,

77
0:04:11.68,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to think big and decisively about how it could tackle

78
0:04:14.2,000 --> 0:04:16,000
the root of its air pollution

79
0:04:16.24,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and many of its other environmental problems:

80
0:04:18.88,000 --> 0:04:19,000
its energy system.

81
0:04:20.8,000 --> 0:04:22,000
For you see, in China,

82
0:04:22.88,000 --> 0:04:24,000
about two thirds of its electricity comes from coal.

83
0:04:26.76,000 --> 0:04:3,000
China has more coal-fired power plants than any other country in the world,

84
0:04:31.48,000 --> 0:04:33,000
about 40 percent of the global total,

85
0:04:34.96,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and it's because of this fact that China's government

86
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:42,000
has decided since 2014 to wage a war on coal,

87
0:04:42.2,000 --> 0:04:44,000
shutting down small coal mines,

88
0:04:44.48,000 --> 0:04:46,000
setting limits on coal consumption,

89
0:04:47.04,000 --> 0:04:51,000
even canceling an Australia's worth of coal-fired power plants.

90
0:04:53.12,000 --> 0:04:55,000
They've also been making enormous investments

91
0:04:55.28,000 --> 0:04:57,000
when it comes to clean and renewable energy,

92
0:04:57.56,000 --> 0:04:59,000
like hydropower, wind and solar,

93
0:05:00.52,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and the pace and the scale of this transformation

94
0:05:03.44,000 --> 0:05:04,000
has been absolutely mind-blowing.

95
0:05:05.32,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Let me give you a couple of statistics to show you what I mean.

96
0:05:08.76,000 --> 0:05:1,000
China leads the world when it comes to hydropower,

97
0:05:11.4,000 --> 0:05:12,000
with a third of total capacity.

98
0:05:13.8,000 --> 0:05:15,000
There's enough for every Chinese citizen

99
0:05:16.2,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to power two homes in a single year from hydropower alone.

100
0:05:20.88,000 --> 0:05:22,000
You may have heard of the Three Gorges Dam,

101
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:24,000
pictured here,

102
0:05:24.24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
which is the largest power station in the world,

103
0:05:26.51,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and it's powered by water.

104
0:05:28.04,000 --> 0:05:29,000
In terms of wind power,

105
0:05:29.4,000 --> 0:05:32,000
China has a third of the global capacity.

106
0:05:32.48,000 --> 0:05:34,000
This makes it the number one leader by far.

107
0:05:35.52,000 --> 0:05:37,000
When we look at solar, China's also leading.

108
0:05:38.48,000 --> 0:05:41,000
In fact, they crushed their 2020 target

109
0:05:42.04,000 --> 0:05:45,000
of installing 105 gigawatts of solar power.

110
0:05:45.52,000 --> 0:05:48,000
This is after the government already revised upwards

111
0:05:48.88,000 --> 0:05:5,000
several times its solar energy target

112
0:05:51.56,000 --> 0:05:53,000
between 2009 and 2015.

113
0:05:54.96,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Last year, in seven months alone,

114
0:05:57.32,000 --> 0:06:01,000
China was able to install a whopping 35 gigawatts of solar power.

115
0:06:02.04,000 --> 0:06:05,000
This is more than half of what the US has combined in total

116
0:06:05.8,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and China did this in just seven months alone.

117
0:06:09.08,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We can verify this remarkable growth in solar power from space,

118
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
like the startup SpaceKnow has done in this slide.

119
0:06:16.96,000 --> 0:06:21,000
By 2020, China is on track to generate Germany's entire electricity consumption

120
0:06:22.6,000 --> 0:06:24,000
from just wind and solar power alone.

121
0:06:25.56,000 --> 0:06:26,000
It's pretty darn remarkable.

122
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And we see some evidence now

123
0:06:30.56,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that China's efforts on clean energy

124
0:06:32.72,000 --> 0:06:34,000
is actually having an effect,

125
0:06:34.84,000 --> 0:06:35,000
not just on air pollution reduction,

126
0:06:36.84,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but also on global climate change,

127
0:06:38.56,000 --> 0:06:4,000
where China has the world's largest carbon footprint.

128
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:46,000
If we look at some of the data, we can see that China's coal consumption

129
0:06:46.04,000 --> 0:06:49,000
may have already reached a peak as early as 2013.

130
0:06:50.32,000 --> 0:06:53,000
This is a major reason why China's government announced

131
0:06:53.72,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that actually they've already achieved their 2020 carbon reduction pledge

132
0:06:58.32,000 --> 0:06:59,000
ahead of schedule.

133
0:07:00.32,000 --> 0:07:02,000
This reduction in coal consumption

134
0:07:02.36,000 --> 0:07:04,000
is also directly driving improvements in air quality

135
0:07:05.36,000 --> 0:07:06,000
across the country,

136
0:07:06.76,000 --> 0:07:07,000
as I've shown here in blue.

137
0:07:09.28,000 --> 0:07:1,000
In most major Chinese cities,

138
0:07:10.84,000 --> 0:07:12,000
air pollution has fallen by as much as 30 percent.

139
0:07:14.8,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And this reduction in air pollution is actually leading people

140
0:07:17.76,000 --> 0:07:18,000
to live longer lives in China,

141
0:07:19.76,000 --> 0:07:24,000
on average two and a half years more than they would have in 2013.

142
0:07:25.68,000 --> 0:07:27,000
In yellow, we can see the cities that have experienced

143
0:07:28.68,000 --> 0:07:29,000
the greatest improvements in air quality.

144
0:07:31.6,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But of course, as I mentioned at the beginning of this talk,

145
0:07:34.52,000 --> 0:07:36,000
we have to temper some of this optimism

146
0:07:36.56,000 --> 0:07:38,000
with a healthy dose of caution,

147
0:07:38.76,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and that's largely because the data are still being determined.

148
0:07:43.48,000 --> 0:07:44,000
At the end of last year,

149
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
after roughly three years of pretty steady global carbon emissions,

150
0:07:49.36,000 --> 0:07:51,000
scientific projections suggest

151
0:07:51.92,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that global emissions may be on the rise again

152
0:07:54.8,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and that could be due to increases in China's fossil fuel consumptions,

153
0:07:58.96,000 --> 0:08:01,000
so they may not have reached that peak that I showed earlier.

154
0:08:02.24,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But of course, the statistics and the data are still murky

155
0:08:05.88,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and that's because China regularly revises its coal statistics after the fact.

156
0:08:11.08,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Actually, it's funny,

157
0:08:12.6,000 --> 0:08:14,000
since I've been here I've been having a debate on Twitter

158
0:08:15.32,000 --> 0:08:16,000
with other climate modelers,

159
0:08:16.88,000 --> 0:08:18,000
trying to figure out whether China's carbon emissions

160
0:08:19.4,000 --> 0:08:22,000
have gone up, gone down or whether they're staying relatively stable.

161
0:08:24.2,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And of course, China is still a rapidly developing country.

162
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It's still experimenting with a range of policies,

163
0:08:30.88,000 --> 0:08:31,000
like dockless bike sharing,

164
0:08:32.52,000 --> 0:08:35,000
which has been hailed as a possible sustainable transport solution.

165
0:08:36.68,000 --> 0:08:39,000
But then we have images of this bicycle graveyard

166
0:08:40.36,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that tell a more cautionary tale.

167
0:08:42.84,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Sometimes, solutions can move too fast

168
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and outpace demand.

169
0:08:47.159,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And of course, coal is still king in China,

170
0:08:51.2,000 --> 0:08:52,000
at least for now.

171
0:08:53.52,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So why should we care about what China is doing on the environment?

172
0:08:57.08,000 --> 0:09:,000
Well, what China does at home on the environment

173
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
can have global implications for the rest of us.

174
0:09:02.92,000 --> 0:09:03,000
To borrow a line from Chai Jing,

175
0:09:04.88,000 --> 0:09:05,000
we're all under the same dome,

176
0:09:06.76,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and air pollution that originates in China

177
0:09:09.44,000 --> 0:09:11,000
can travel beyond its borders

178
0:09:11.56,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and affect populations as far away as those in North America.

179
0:09:16.2,000 --> 0:09:18,000
China's not only exporting air pollution,

180
0:09:18.8,000 --> 0:09:22,000
but they're also exporting aid, infrastructure, technology abroad.

181
0:09:24.2,000 --> 0:09:29,000
President Xi Jinping in 2013 announced the One Belt, One Road Initiative,

182
0:09:29.8,000 --> 0:09:33,000
a massive, one-trillion-US-dollar infrastructure investment project

183
0:09:34.2,000 --> 0:09:35,000
in more than 60 other countries.

184
0:09:36.56,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And historically, when we've seen

185
0:09:38.68,000 --> 0:09:4,000
that China has made these infrastructure investments abroad,

186
0:09:41.6,000 --> 0:09:42,000
they haven't always been clean.

187
0:09:43.76,000 --> 0:09:46,000
The Global Environment Institute, a Chinese civil society group,

188
0:09:47.36,000 --> 0:09:49,000
found that in the last 15 years,

189
0:09:49.76,000 --> 0:09:53,000
China has invested in more than 240 coal-fired power plants

190
0:09:53.84,000 --> 0:09:55,000
in more than 68 countries

191
0:09:55.96,000 --> 0:09:57,000
affiliated with the One Belt, One Road Initiative.

192
0:09:58.76,000 --> 0:10:02,000
That's more than a quarter of China's own domestic coal-fired capacity

193
0:10:02.92,000 --> 0:10:03,000
that is exported abroad.

194
0:10:04.76,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So we can see that even though China is cleaning up at home,

195
0:10:08.92,000 --> 0:10:1,000
it's exporting some of that pollution

196
0:10:11.12,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to other countries,

197
0:10:12.64,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and greenhouse gas emissions simply don't have a passport.

198
0:10:16.24,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So when we're trying to evaluate this question

199
0:10:18.44,000 --> 0:10:2,000
of whether or not China is actually leading,

200
0:10:20.56,000 --> 0:10:22,000
we can see it's still very much an open debate.

201
0:10:24.04,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But time is running out.

202
0:10:25.68,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I've studied the climate models, and the outlook is not good.

203
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We still have a gap between current policies

204
0:10:32.72,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and what needs to happen if we want to avoid dangerous climate change.

205
0:10:37.24,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Leadership is what we desperately need,

206
0:10:39.8,000 --> 0:10:41,000
but it's not coming from the US, for example.

207
0:10:42.32,000 --> 0:10:45,000
The US administration last June announced its intent

208
0:10:45.36,000 --> 0:10:47,000
to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement,

209
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:51,000
so now people are looking towards China to fill that leadership void.

210
0:10:52.04,000 --> 0:10:54,000
So China is very much in the driver's seat

211
0:10:54.44,000 --> 0:10:56,000
determining our global environmental future.

212
0:10:57.76,000 --> 0:10:59,000
What they do on carbon trading,

213
0:10:59.84,000 --> 0:11:01,000
on clean energy, on air pollution,

214
0:11:03.68,000 --> 0:11:04,000
we can learn many lessons.

215
0:11:05.88,000 --> 0:11:09,000
One of those lessons is that clean energy is not just good for the environment,

216
0:11:10.24,000 --> 0:11:12,000
it can save lives by reducing air pollution.

217
0:11:13.68,000 --> 0:11:14,000
It's also good for the economy.

218
0:11:15.88,000 --> 0:11:16,000
We can see that last year,

219
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
China was responsible for 30 percent of the global growth

220
0:11:20.52,000 --> 0:11:21,000
in green jobs.

221
0:11:21.92,000 --> 0:11:22,000
The US? Only six.

222
0:11:24.8,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So the picture that I just painted for you

223
0:11:27.24,000 --> 0:11:29,000
hopefully seems much different

224
0:11:29.44,000 --> 0:11:32,000
from those murky, foggy air quality statistics

225
0:11:32.6,000 --> 0:11:35,000
to a much clearer picture of China's clean energy.

226
0:11:36.08,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And even though China is headed in the right direction,

227
0:11:39.04,000 --> 0:11:41,000
we know that there's still a very long road ahead.

228
0:11:42.52,000 --> 0:11:44,000
So let me ask you once more: Is seeing believing?

229
0:11:45.88,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Can we trust the data and the statistics

230
0:11:47.84,000 --> 0:11:5,000
that show that China's air quality is coming down

231
0:11:51.12,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and that its war on coal is actually having an effect?

232
0:11:55.44,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Well, let's take a look at some of the latest satellite images

233
0:11:58.88,000 --> 0:12:,000
of China's solar power installations.

234
0:12:02.64,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I want you to look very closely at this image.

235
0:12:06.44,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Can you see?

236
0:12:08.2,000 --> 0:12:11,000
The proof may just be in the pandas.

237
0:12:11.36,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Thank you so much.

238
0:12:12.6,000 --> 0:12:16,000
(Applause)

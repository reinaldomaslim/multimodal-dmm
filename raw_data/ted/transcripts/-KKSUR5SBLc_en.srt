2
0:00:13.5,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Now, I know it might be easy to think

3
0:00:15.958,000 --> 0:00:16,000
that microbes are bad,

4
0:00:17.875,000 --> 0:00:19,000
especially for infants,

5
0:00:20.292,000 --> 0:00:22,000
but research has in fact proven the opposite.

6
0:00:24.375,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And the truth might be a little bit more complex,

7
0:00:27.417,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but it's actually way more interesting.

8
0:00:31.5,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It seems that we need microbes

9
0:00:33.875,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to be programmed for good health,

10
0:00:37.083,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but not just any microbes,

11
0:00:38.833,000 --> 0:00:4,000
we need the right combination.

12
0:00:41.25,000 --> 0:00:43,000
We succeed best with the little microbial bodies

13
0:00:43.958,000 --> 0:00:46,000
we have adapted to coexist with during evolution.

14
0:00:48.875,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And I guess it won't surprise you

15
0:00:50.542,000 --> 0:00:54,000
to learn that we start acquiring that right combination right at birth.

16
0:00:55.25,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Well, at least some of us do.

17
0:00:58.667,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Babies born by C-section and babies born vaginally

18
0:01:01.708,000 --> 0:01:02,000
aren't the same

19
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:06,000
when it comes to microbial start to life,

20
0:01:06.167,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and after birth there are countless different early life events

21
0:01:10.583,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and circumstances

22
0:01:11.917,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that further modulate the way the gut microbiota is developing,

23
0:01:16.083,000 --> 0:01:21,000
such as the medications that might be prescribed for the infant or the mother,

24
0:01:21.208,000 --> 0:01:24,000
number of pets and siblings in the family,

25
0:01:24.375,000 --> 0:01:25,000
as well as level of hygiene at home,

26
0:01:26.208,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and, in this case, it's actually better

27
0:01:28.208,000 --> 0:01:3,000
if it's not that perfectly clean all the time.

28
0:01:32.542,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And also nutrition, both mothers and infants.

29
0:01:35.833,000 --> 0:01:39,000
All of these events and circumstances play a huge role

30
0:01:40.792,000 --> 0:01:42,000
in the gut microbial development

31
0:01:43.292,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and that has a huge impact on the lifelong health of that baby.

32
0:01:49.167,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And I'm not talking about small health implications here.

33
0:01:52.708,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I'm talking about the big stuff.

34
0:01:55.167,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Microbes we acquire or do not acquire

35
0:01:58.25,000 --> 0:02:03,000
affect our likelihood of developing diseases like obesity, diabetes

36
0:02:03.292,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and even some cancers.

37
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Since many of these early life events I just listed

38
0:02:09.125,000 --> 0:02:11,000
are such that we cannot affect them,

39
0:02:11.5,000 --> 0:02:12,000
they are inevitable,

40
0:02:12.958,000 --> 0:02:15,000
for example C-sections have been invented to save lives,

41
0:02:16.292,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and they do that daily,

42
0:02:18.375,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and most medications are prescribed for a valid reason,

43
0:02:22.167,000 --> 0:02:24,000
especially for infants, and so on.

44
0:02:25.042,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That is why we have to learn

45
0:02:28.167,000 --> 0:02:3,000
how to protect the health of these babies

46
0:02:30.708,000 --> 0:02:33,000
after the occurrence of such early life events

47
0:02:34.167,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that might disrupt their gut microbiota development.

48
0:02:38.542,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I work as a researcher

49
0:02:39.917,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and as a technical lead of an infant health platform,

50
0:02:43.292,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and the question I'm trying to find a solution to every day at work,

51
0:02:47.542,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and the same question I'm aiming to answer in this talk,

52
0:02:51.333,000 --> 0:02:53,000
is how can we make sure

53
0:02:53.833,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that all babies get the same shot at lifelong health,

54
0:02:57.125,000 --> 0:03:02,000
no matter how they're born or what early life events they encounter.

55
0:03:03.375,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Seems like a noble cause, right?

56
0:03:06.125,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Great.

57
0:03:07.417,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So let's figure this out.

58
0:03:09.125,000 --> 0:03:14,000
To begin, remember how I said that we need the right combination of microbes?

59
0:03:16.333,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Well, to get that combination right,

60
0:03:18.458,000 --> 0:03:21,000
we need to receive those microbes that inhabit our bodies

61
0:03:21.958,000 --> 0:03:22,000
in a certain order.

62
0:03:24.875,000 --> 0:03:27,000
You can think of it like a colonization march.

63
0:03:28.375,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The very early microbes that inhabit our bodies first

64
0:03:33.125,000 --> 0:03:36,000
change the environment in the infant's gut

65
0:03:36.708,000 --> 0:03:4,000
so that the next microbes are able to move in,

66
0:03:40.792,000 --> 0:03:41,000
kind of like the first invaders

67
0:03:42.708,000 --> 0:03:44,000
come in first and set up the infrastructure

68
0:03:45.083,000 --> 0:03:47,000
for the other settlers to build upon.

69
0:03:48.292,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Now, if babies are born via C-section,

70
0:03:51.083,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that early phase of colonization is greatly altered,

71
0:03:55.125,000 --> 0:03:59,000
because instead of vaginal, fecal and skin bacteria of the mother,

72
0:03:59.875,000 --> 0:04:02,000
mainly only skin bacteria enter the infant gut.

73
0:04:03.833,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And that sets that colonization march to a totally different tone,

74
0:04:08.75,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and simply because that's different to what we've adapted to during evolution,

75
0:04:14.625,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that might cause some health disadvantages for C-section-born babies later on.

76
0:04:20.25,000 --> 0:04:22,000
We can take weight development as an example here.

77
0:04:23.208,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It has been already shown in several studies

78
0:04:26.167,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that gut microbiota composition

79
0:04:28.333,000 --> 0:04:29,000
is associated to weight

80
0:04:30.208,000 --> 0:04:32,000
as well as the likelihood of developing diseases

81
0:04:32.542,000 --> 0:04:35,000
like diabetes or cardiovascular diseases.

82
0:04:36.25,000 --> 0:04:38,000
But now there are some indications

83
0:04:38.708,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that you could already at infancy

84
0:04:41.25,000 --> 0:04:43,000
see from a fecal sample of a baby

85
0:04:43.75,000 --> 0:04:46,000
some microbes missing from those individuals

86
0:04:46.792,000 --> 0:04:49,000
who will later on develop to be obese or overweight.

87
0:04:51.125,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It has also been shown that those same microbes

88
0:04:55.125,000 --> 0:04:58,000
might be missing from babies who are born by C-section

89
0:04:58.375,000 --> 0:05:02,000
or who are predisposed to heavy loads of antibiotics in early life.

90
0:05:02.792,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And to kind of close this loop,

91
0:05:04.458,000 --> 0:05:06,000
it has also been shown in some research

92
0:05:06.833,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that babies born by C-section

93
0:05:08.958,000 --> 0:05:12,000
or are prescribed with many, many antibiotics early in life

94
0:05:13.042,000 --> 0:05:17,000
are more likely to be obese or overweight, even by 50 percent,

95
0:05:17.167,000 --> 0:05:18,000
which is a lot.

96
0:05:19.5,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Now, I know you might be thinking at this point

97
0:05:21.792,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that, oh no, I just had a C-section or I was born via C-section

98
0:05:26.292,000 --> 0:05:28,000
or my child had the antibiotics.

99
0:05:29.917,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But I want you to not worry.

100
0:05:32.875,000 --> 0:05:34,000
If these microbes are missing

101
0:05:35.833,000 --> 0:05:37,000
or are lost for any reason,

102
0:05:38.167,000 --> 0:05:41,000
they can be acquired later,

103
0:05:41.333,000 --> 0:05:43,000
but the baby just needs a little help with that.

104
0:05:44.708,000 --> 0:05:48,000
One thing that has already for some time been known to help is breastfeeding.

105
0:05:50.417,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Breast milk is kind of miraculous:

106
0:05:52.5,000 --> 0:05:55,000
in addition to containing nutrients for the baby,

107
0:05:55.625,000 --> 0:05:59,000
it seems to contain food for the good microbes as well.

108
0:06:01.792,000 --> 0:06:03,000
That's great for a breastfed baby,

109
0:06:04.667,000 --> 0:06:08,000
but we all know that all babies are not breastfed.

110
0:06:08.708,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So what could we do to ensure that also those babies who are not breastfed

111
0:06:13.958,000 --> 0:06:15,000
could restore their microbiota development

112
0:06:16.417,000 --> 0:06:19,000
after encountering those disruptive early life events

113
0:06:20.167,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that might disrupt their gut microbiota development?

114
0:06:23.917,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And now we get to the actual solution part of this talk.

115
0:06:29.375,000 --> 0:06:33,000
The research in this field has been taking giant steps lately.

116
0:06:33.625,000 --> 0:06:37,000
First, it was understood that if there are some microbes missing,

117
0:06:37.708,000 --> 0:06:39,000
they can be ingested.

118
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:44,000
We call the good microbes, when they are ingested, probiotics,

119
0:06:44.083,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and probiotics have been tested

120
0:06:45.667,000 --> 0:06:47,000
in several clinical trials during the years,

121
0:06:48.458,000 --> 0:06:5,000
also in infants, with great effects,

122
0:06:50.75,000 --> 0:06:53,000
such as reducing their risk of eczema later in life.

123
0:06:55.458,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Now, a second revolution was realized

124
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:01,000
when the eyes of researchers were turned to breast milk.

125
0:07:01.125,000 --> 0:07:03,000
That was logical, as, like I mentioned,

126
0:07:03.458,000 --> 0:07:07,000
it was already known that breastfeeding is able to support the healthy development

127
0:07:08.333,000 --> 0:07:09,000
of gut microbiota.

128
0:07:11.75,000 --> 0:07:14,000
There were these particles in breast milk

129
0:07:15.5,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that were found already in the 1930s

130
0:07:19.083,000 --> 0:07:21,000
called human milk oligosaccharides,

131
0:07:21.625,000 --> 0:07:23,000
but their function remained a mystery

132
0:07:24.583,000 --> 0:07:28,000
for decades and decades after their initial discovery.

133
0:07:29.833,000 --> 0:07:31,000
They were really puzzling for researchers,

134
0:07:32.5,000 --> 0:07:35,000
as they are really abundant in human milk.

135
0:07:36.25,000 --> 0:07:39,000
They are actually the third-largest group of solids,

136
0:07:39.875,000 --> 0:07:42,000
but they are not digestible by humans, not even infants.

137
0:07:43.667,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So why would mothers synthesize something to breast milk,

138
0:07:47.375,000 --> 0:07:49,000
use their resources to put something there

139
0:07:50.167,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that is not utilizable by the infant?

140
0:07:53.208,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Usually nature does not work that way.

141
0:07:55.667,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Right?

142
0:07:56.958,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So it was quite a revelation when it was finally understood

143
0:08:00.75,000 --> 0:08:02,000
what's the role of these particles,

144
0:08:02.958,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and that it is to selectively feed the microbes that are best for infants,

145
0:08:08.375,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and that way to affect the infant health.

146
0:08:11.792,000 --> 0:08:15,000
There are over a hundred of different HMO structures,

147
0:08:15.917,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and nowadays we are able to synthesize some of them also in the lab,

148
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and that enables us to package them up

149
0:08:24.417,000 --> 0:08:27,000
with probiotics for children and infants

150
0:08:27.667,000 --> 0:08:29,000
who are not able to receive them from breast milk

151
0:08:30.417,000 --> 0:08:32,000
to restore their microbiota

152
0:08:32.583,000 --> 0:08:35,000
after encountering disruptive early life events.

153
0:08:37.417,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And that is the solution.

154
0:08:39.708,000 --> 0:08:42,000
As a researcher, I must say at this point

155
0:08:42.917,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that research in this field is still ongoing

156
0:08:45.875,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and a lot of work remains to be done.

157
0:08:48.833,000 --> 0:08:51,000
That's a favorite sentence of us scientists.

158
0:08:52.25,000 --> 0:08:57,000
But we are taking steps towards understanding better and better

159
0:08:57.292,000 --> 0:09:,000
which are the key missing microbes in various situations

160
0:09:01.042,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and what HMOs we should package with which probiotics

161
0:09:05.625,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to help restore the microbiota of that particular baby in that particular case.

162
0:09:13.458,000 --> 0:09:15,000
What I wish you to remember from this talk

163
0:09:16.083,000 --> 0:09:2,000
is that, yes, vaginally born breastfed baby has the microbiota

164
0:09:20.833,000 --> 0:09:21,000
we have evolved to adapt to,

165
0:09:22.833,000 --> 0:09:25,000
but in cases where that is not possible,

166
0:09:26.292,000 --> 0:09:3,000
there are means to reduce the negative health consequences.

167
0:09:33.083,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Lastly, I wish you to imagine a world for a while,

168
0:09:37.917,000 --> 0:09:39,000
a world where there would be such a health care system

169
0:09:40.708,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that when you take your baby to a health care check,

170
0:09:43.5,000 --> 0:09:47,000
they would routinely monitor the gut microbiota development of that baby,

171
0:09:47.833,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and if any disruptions would be noted,

172
0:09:50.5,000 --> 0:09:53,000
a tailor-made product to restore the microbiota

173
0:09:54.208,000 --> 0:09:55,000
would be prescribed.

174
0:09:56.583,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I mean, how wonderful would that be,

175
0:09:59.542,000 --> 0:10:03,000
if the onset of any chronic diseases would be extremely rare

176
0:10:04.125,000 --> 0:10:06,000
because of this preemptive health care system?

177
0:10:08.458,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Can you imagine such a world?

178
0:10:11.458,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Do you believe that that kind of future would be possible?

179
0:10:17.583,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I do.

180
0:10:19.083,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I believe in that future and I want to contribute

181
0:10:21.833,000 --> 0:10:22,000
in the unfolding of that future,

182
0:10:25.25,000 --> 0:10:29,000
a future in which each baby has an equal starting point for life

183
0:10:30.125,000 --> 0:10:32,000
to be programmed for lifelong health.

184
0:10:33.208,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Thank you.

185
0:10:34.5,000 --> 0:10:36,000
(Applause)

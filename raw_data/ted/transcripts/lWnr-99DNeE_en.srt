1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
This is a picture of a sunset on Mars

2
0:00:15.6,000 --> 0:00:18,000
taken by NASA's Curiosity rover in 2013.

3
0:00:19.96,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Mars is a very cold planet,

4
0:00:21.84,000 --> 0:00:23,000
flooded with high levels of UV radiation

5
0:00:24.12,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and extremely dry.

6
0:00:26.04,000 --> 0:00:3,000
In fact, Mars is considered to be too dry for life as we know it.

7
0:00:30.96,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I'm an astrobiologist.

8
0:00:32.2,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I try to understand the origin of life on Earth

9
0:00:35.12,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and the possibilities of finding life

10
0:00:37.36,000 --> 0:00:38,000
elsewhere in the universe.

11
0:00:39.4,000 --> 0:00:4,000
People sometimes ask me,

12
0:00:40.68,000 --> 0:00:42,000
how can you be an astrobiologist

13
0:00:42.88,000 --> 0:00:43,000
if you don't have your own spaceship?

14
0:00:45.64,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Well, what I do is that I study life

15
0:00:47.88,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in those environments on Earth

16
0:00:49.88,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that most closely resemble other interesting places in the universe.

17
0:00:54.12,000 --> 0:00:56,000
All life on Earth requires water,

18
0:00:56.6,000 --> 0:00:58,000
so in my case I focus on the intimate relationship

19
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
between water and life

20
0:01:00.68,000 --> 0:01:01,000
in order to understand

21
0:01:02.28,000 --> 0:01:05,000
if we could find life in a planet as dry as Mars.

22
0:01:06.44,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But since I do not have the 2.5 billion dollars

23
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to send my own robot to Mars,

24
0:01:12.24,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I study the most Martian place on Earth,

25
0:01:15.2,000 --> 0:01:16,000
the Atacama Desert.

26
0:01:16.76,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Located in northern Chile,

27
0:01:18.44,000 --> 0:01:21,000
it is the oldest and driest desert on Earth.

28
0:01:22.08,000 --> 0:01:23,000
To give you an idea of how dry it is,

29
0:01:24.08,000 --> 0:01:29,000
consider here in Vancouver it rains over 1,000 millimeters of rain every year.

30
0:01:29.88,000 --> 0:01:32,000
In the Atacama, there are places with no reported rains

31
0:01:33.52,000 --> 0:01:34,000
in the last 400 years.

32
0:01:36.88,000 --> 0:01:37,000
How do I know this?

33
0:01:38.6,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Well, because I was born and raised in the Atacama --

34
0:01:42.12,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:43.76,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So I had a unique advantage

36
0:01:45.8,000 --> 0:01:47,000
when I started studying this desert.

37
0:01:48.88,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So let me tell you guys a few fantastic examples

38
0:01:52.44,000 --> 0:01:53,000
he has found

39
0:01:54.12,000 --> 0:01:57,000
on how life has adapted to live with almost no water at all.

40
0:01:58.64,000 --> 0:02:,000
One of my first findings was in the entrance of a cave

41
0:02:01.24,000 --> 0:02:02,000
facing the Pacific Ocean.

42
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:06,000
In this place, we reported a new type of microalgae

43
0:02:06.72,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that grew only on top of the spiderwebs that covered the cave entrance.

44
0:02:11.24,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Have you ever seen a spiderweb early in the morning?

45
0:02:15.2,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It's covered with dew,

46
0:02:16.8,000 --> 0:02:19,000
so this microalgae learned that in order to carry photosynthesis

47
0:02:20.08,000 --> 0:02:23,000
in the coast of the driest desert on Earth,

48
0:02:23.12,000 --> 0:02:24,000
they could use the spiderwebs.

49
0:02:24.64,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So here they may access the water from the fogs

50
0:02:27.08,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that regularly cover these areas in the morning.

51
0:02:30.64,000 --> 0:02:32,000
In another cave, we found a different type of microalgae.

52
0:02:34.12,000 --> 0:02:38,000
This one is able to use ocean mist as a source of water,

53
0:02:38.36,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and strikingly lives in the very bottom of a cave,

54
0:02:41.52,000 --> 0:02:44,000
so it has adapted to live with less than 0.1 percent

55
0:02:44.76,000 --> 0:02:47,000
of the amount of light that regular plants need.

56
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:52,000
These type of findings suggest to me that on Mars,

57
0:02:52.04,000 --> 0:02:54,000
we may find even photosynthetic life inside caves.

58
0:02:54.92,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And by the way, that's me.

59
0:02:56.32,000 --> 0:02:58,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Now, for almost 15 years this region of Yungay, discovered by NASA,

61
0:03:04.92,000 --> 0:03:07,000
was thought to be the driest place of this desert,

62
0:03:07.96,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but I knew that it was not.

63
0:03:09.72,000 --> 0:03:11,000
How? You already know the answer.

64
0:03:12.12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Because I was born and raised in this desert.

65
0:03:14.36,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So I remembered that I usually see fogs in Yungay,

66
0:03:19.04,000 --> 0:03:21,000
so after setting sensors in a number of places,

67
0:03:21.28,000 --> 0:03:24,000
where I remember never seeing fogs or clouds,

68
0:03:24.36,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I reported four other sites much drier than Yungay,

69
0:03:28.4,000 --> 0:03:3,000
with this one, María Elena South,

70
0:03:31.04,000 --> 0:03:34,000
being the truly driest place on Earth,

71
0:03:34.52,000 --> 0:03:35,000
as dry as Mars,

72
0:03:36.52,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and amazingly, just a 15-minute ride

73
0:03:38.88,000 --> 0:03:4,000
from the small mining town where I was born.

74
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Now, in this search, we were trying to actually find the dry limit

75
0:03:45.44,000 --> 0:03:46,000
for life on Earth,

76
0:03:46.68,000 --> 0:03:49,000
a place so dry that nothing was able to survive in it.

77
0:03:50.56,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But even here, well hidden underground,

78
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
we found a number of different microorganisms,

79
0:03:55.6,000 --> 0:03:58,000
which suggested to me that similarly dry places, like Mars,

80
0:03:59.08,000 --> 0:04:,000
may be inhabited.

81
0:04:01.36,000 --> 0:04:03,000
We even have some preliminary evidences

82
0:04:03.68,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that these microorganisms may still be active

83
0:04:06.24,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in the desiccated state,

84
0:04:08.2,000 --> 0:04:11,000
like walking mummies all around us,

85
0:04:12.04,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and that they may be using UV radiation as a source of energy.

86
0:04:16.88,000 --> 0:04:2,000
If confirmed, this would have a huge impact on our definition of life,

87
0:04:21.48,000 --> 0:04:23,000
on how we look for life elsewhere in the universe.

88
0:04:24.76,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Due to its clear skies, by 2020,

89
0:04:27.8,000 --> 0:04:29,000
60 percent of the biggest telescopes on Earth

90
0:04:30.48,000 --> 0:04:32,000
will be located in the Atacama,

91
0:04:32.72,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and while everyone else will be looking among the stars

92
0:04:35.64,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to answer the question, "Are we alone?"

93
0:04:38.8,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I will be looking down to the ground

94
0:04:40.72,000 --> 0:04:42,000
searching for this same answer

95
0:04:43.32,000 --> 0:04:44,000
in my own backyard.

96
0:04:44.96,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Thank you.

97
0:04:46.2,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Applause)

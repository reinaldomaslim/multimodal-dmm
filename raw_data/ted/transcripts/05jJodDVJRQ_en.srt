1
0:00:12.937,000 --> 0:00:13,000
This is a photograph

2
0:00:14.633,000 --> 0:00:16,000
of a man whom for many years

3
0:00:17.449,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I plotted to kill.

4
0:00:21.17,000 --> 0:00:24,000
This is my father,

5
0:00:24.19,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Clinton George "Bageye" Grant.

6
0:00:27.927,000 --> 0:00:29,000
He's called Bageye because he has

7
0:00:30.198,000 --> 0:00:34,000
permanent bags under his eyes.

8
0:00:34.358,000 --> 0:00:36,000
As a 10-year-old, along with my siblings,

9
0:00:37.134,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I dreamt of scraping off the poison

10
0:00:41.25,000 --> 0:00:44,000
from fly-killer paper into his coffee,

11
0:00:45.2,000 --> 0:00:46,000
grounded down glass and sprinkling it

12
0:00:47.055,000 --> 0:00:49,000
over his breakfast,

13
0:00:50.044,000 --> 0:00:51,000
loosening the carpet on the stairs

14
0:00:51.754,000 --> 0:00:54,000
so he would trip and break his neck.

15
0:00:55.482,000 --> 0:00:56,000
But come the day, he would always

16
0:00:57.109,000 --> 0:00:59,000
skip that loose step,

17
0:00:59.361,000 --> 0:01:,000
he would always bow out of the house

18
0:01:01.19,000 --> 0:01:02,000
without so much as a swig of coffee

19
0:01:03.03,000 --> 0:01:05,000
or a bite to eat.

20
0:01:05.818,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And so for many years,

21
0:01:07.104,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I feared that my father would die

22
0:01:09.064,000 --> 0:01:11,000
before I had a chance to kill him.

23
0:01:11.138,000 --> 0:01:15,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:15.73,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Up until our mother asked him to leave

25
0:01:18.721,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and not come back,

26
0:01:20.378,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Bageye had been a terrifying ogre.

27
0:01:24.634,000 --> 0:01:27,000
He teetered permanently on the verge of rage,

28
0:01:28.219,000 --> 0:01:31,000
rather like me, as you see.

29
0:01:31.827,000 --> 0:01:34,000
He worked nights at Vauxhall Motors in Luton

30
0:01:35.127,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and demanded total silence throughout the house,

31
0:01:38.286,000 --> 0:01:4,000
so that when we came home from school

32
0:01:40.958,000 --> 0:01:42,000
at 3:30 in the afternoon, we would huddle

33
0:01:42.998,000 --> 0:01:45,000
beside the TV, and rather like safe-crackers,

34
0:01:46.248,000 --> 0:01:48,000
we would twiddle with the volume control knob

35
0:01:48.734,000 --> 0:01:5,000
on the TV so it was almost inaudible.

36
0:01:51.527,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And at times, when we were like this,

37
0:01:53.838,000 --> 0:01:55,000
so much "Shhh," so much "Shhh"

38
0:01:56.27,000 --> 0:01:57,000
going on in the house

39
0:01:58.135,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that I imagined us to be like

40
0:02:00.11,000 --> 0:02:03,000
the German crew of a U-boat

41
0:02:03.61,000 --> 0:02:05,000
creeping along the edge of the ocean

42
0:02:06.102,000 --> 0:02:07,000
whilst up above, on the surface,

43
0:02:07.918,000 --> 0:02:1,000
HMS Bageye patrolled

44
0:02:11.663,000 --> 0:02:13,000
ready to drop death charges

45
0:02:13.79,000 --> 0:02:16,000
at the first sound of any disturbance.

46
0:02:17.777,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So that lesson was the lesson that

47
0:02:20.712,000 --> 0:02:21,000
"Do not draw attention to yourself

48
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
either in the home or outside of the home."

49
0:02:24.424,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Maybe it's a migrant lesson.

50
0:02:27.11,000 --> 0:02:3,000
We were to be below the radar,

51
0:02:30.28,000 --> 0:02:31,000
so there was no communication, really,

52
0:02:31.775,000 --> 0:02:34,000
between Bageye and us and us and Bageye,

53
0:02:34.936,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and the sound that we most looked forward to,

54
0:02:37.544,000 --> 0:02:38,000
you know when you're a child and you want

55
0:02:39.298,000 --> 0:02:42,000
your father to come home and it's all going to be happy

56
0:02:42.736,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and you're waiting for that sound of the door opening.

57
0:02:44.49,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Well the sound that we looked forward to

58
0:02:45.746,000 --> 0:02:46,000
was the click of the door closing,

59
0:02:47.639,000 --> 0:02:51,000
which meant he'd gone and would not come back.

60
0:02:52.347,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So for three decades,

61
0:02:55.806,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I never laid eyes on my father, nor he on me.

62
0:02:58.847,000 --> 0:02:59,000
We never spoke to each other for three decades,

63
0:03:00.615,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and then a couple of years ago, I decided

64
0:03:02.416,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to turn the spotlight on him.

65
0:03:06.687,000 --> 0:03:07,000
"You are being watched.

66
0:03:08.575,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Actually, you are.

67
0:03:10.431,000 --> 0:03:12,000
You are being watched."

68
0:03:12.495,000 --> 0:03:14,000
That was his mantra to us, his children.

69
0:03:15.159,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Time and time again he would say this to us.

70
0:03:16.832,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And this was the 1970s, it was Luton,

71
0:03:19.935,000 --> 0:03:2,000
where he worked at Vauxhall Motors,

72
0:03:21.564,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and he was a Jamaican.

73
0:03:23.391,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And what he meant was,

74
0:03:24.45,000 --> 0:03:26,000
you as a child of a Jamaican immigrant

75
0:03:26.561,000 --> 0:03:27,000
are being watched

76
0:03:28.479,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to see which way you turn, to see whether

77
0:03:30.136,000 --> 0:03:34,000
you conform to the host nation's stereotype of you,

78
0:03:34.255,000 --> 0:03:36,000
of being feckless, work-shy,

79
0:03:36.855,000 --> 0:03:38,000
destined for a life of crime.

80
0:03:39.416,000 --> 0:03:4,000
You are being watched,

81
0:03:41.15,000 --> 0:03:45,000
so confound their expectations of you.

82
0:03:45.493,000 --> 0:03:49,000
To that end, Bageye and his friends,

83
0:03:49.771,000 --> 0:03:5,000
mostly Jamaican,

84
0:03:51.426,000 --> 0:03:54,000
exhibited a kind of Jamaican bella figura:

85
0:03:55.18,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Turn your best side to the world,

86
0:03:57.794,000 --> 0:03:59,000
show your best face to the world.

87
0:04:00.068,000 --> 0:04:01,000
If you have seen some of the images

88
0:04:01.842,000 --> 0:04:03,000
of the Caribbean people arriving

89
0:04:03.978,000 --> 0:04:04,000
in the '40s and '50s,

90
0:04:05.63,000 --> 0:04:06,000
you might have noticed that a lot of the men

91
0:04:07.026,000 --> 0:04:08,000
wear trilbies.

92
0:04:08.915,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Now, there was no tradition of wearing trilbies in Jamaica.

93
0:04:12.556,000 --> 0:04:14,000
They invented that tradition for their arrival here.

94
0:04:15.499,000 --> 0:04:16,000
They wanted to project themselves in a way

95
0:04:17.266,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that they wanted to be perceived,

96
0:04:19.6,000 --> 0:04:2,000
so that the way they looked

97
0:04:21.031,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and the names that they gave themselves

98
0:04:23.974,000 --> 0:04:24,000
defined them.

99
0:04:25.646,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So Bageye is bald and has baggy eyes.

100
0:04:31.135,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Tidy Boots is very fussy about his footwear.

101
0:04:35.147,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Anxious is always anxious.

102
0:04:37.859,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Clock has one arm longer than the other.

103
0:04:40.588,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Laughter)

104
0:04:44.236,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And my all-time favorite was the guy they called Summerwear.

105
0:04:47.61,000 --> 0:04:48,000
When Summerwear came to this country

106
0:04:49.444,000 --> 0:04:51,000
from Jamaica in the early '60s, he insisted

107
0:04:51.563,000 --> 0:04:53,000
on wearing light summer suits,

108
0:04:53.94,000 --> 0:04:54,000
no matter the weather,

109
0:04:55.596,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and in the course of researching their lives,

110
0:04:56.934,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I asked my mom, "Whatever became of Summerwear?"

111
0:04:59.91,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And she said, "He caught a cold and died." (Laughter)

112
0:05:04.737,000 --> 0:05:05,000
But men like Summerwear

113
0:05:06.593,000 --> 0:05:07,000
taught us the importance of style.

114
0:05:08.055,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Maybe they exaggerated their style

115
0:05:10.177,000 --> 0:05:13,000
because they thought that they were not considered

116
0:05:13.393,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to be quite civilized,

117
0:05:15.497,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and they transferred that generational attitude

118
0:05:18.313,000 --> 0:05:2,000
or anxiety onto us, the next generation,

119
0:05:20.913,000 --> 0:05:22,000
so much so that when I was growing up,

120
0:05:23.1,000 --> 0:05:25,000
if ever on the television news or radio

121
0:05:25.473,000 --> 0:05:26,000
a report came up about a black person

122
0:05:26.981,000 --> 0:05:27,000
committing some crime —

123
0:05:28.665,000 --> 0:05:31,000
a mugging, a murder, a burglary —

124
0:05:32.329,000 --> 0:05:35,000
we winced along with our parents,

125
0:05:35.881,000 --> 0:05:37,000
because they were letting the side down.

126
0:05:38.545,000 --> 0:05:39,000
You did not just represent yourself.

127
0:05:39.998,000 --> 0:05:4,000
You represented the group,

128
0:05:41.74,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and it was a terrifying thing to come to terms with,

129
0:05:46.248,000 --> 0:05:48,000
in a way, that maybe you were going

130
0:05:48.512,000 --> 0:05:52,000
to be perceived in the same light.

131
0:05:52.656,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So that was what needed to be challenged.

132
0:05:56.428,000 --> 0:06:,000
Our father and many of his colleagues

133
0:06:00.709,000 --> 0:06:03,000
exhibited a kind of transmission but not receiving.

134
0:06:04.17,000 --> 0:06:06,000
They were built to transmit but not receive.

135
0:06:06.392,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We were to keep quiet.

136
0:06:09.243,000 --> 0:06:1,000
When our father did speak to us,

137
0:06:10.596,000 --> 0:06:12,000
it was from the pulpit of his mind.

138
0:06:13.461,000 --> 0:06:14,000
They clung to certainty in the belief

139
0:06:15.049,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that doubt would undermine them.

140
0:06:19.178,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But when I am working in my house

141
0:06:22.769,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and writing, after a day's writing, I rush downstairs

142
0:06:26.62,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and I'm very excited to talk about Marcus Garvey or Bob Marley

143
0:06:29.926,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and words are tripping out of my mouth like butterflies

144
0:06:32.79,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and I'm so excited that my children stop me,

145
0:06:35.286,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and they say, "Dad, nobody cares."

146
0:06:38.966,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Laughter)

147
0:06:42.956,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But they do care, actually.

148
0:06:44.87,000 --> 0:06:45,000
They cross over.

149
0:06:46.433,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Somehow they find their way to you.

150
0:06:48.94,000 --> 0:06:51,000
They shape their lives according to the narrative of your life,

151
0:06:52.544,000 --> 0:06:56,000
as I did with my father and my mother, perhaps,

152
0:06:56.57,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and maybe Bageye did with his father.

153
0:06:59.184,000 --> 0:07:,000
And that was clearer to me

154
0:07:00.826,000 --> 0:07:02,000
in the course of looking at his life

155
0:07:03.784,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and understanding, as they say,

156
0:07:06.84,000 --> 0:07:07,000
the Native Americans say,

157
0:07:08.152,000 --> 0:07:09,000
"Do not criticize the man until you can walk

158
0:07:09.781,000 --> 0:07:11,000
in his moccasins."

159
0:07:12.093,000 --> 0:07:14,000
But in conjuring his life, it was okay

160
0:07:14.992,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and very straightforward to portray

161
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
a Caribbean life in England in the 1970s

162
0:07:21.24,000 --> 0:07:25,000
with bowls of plastic fruit,

163
0:07:26.224,000 --> 0:07:29,000
polystyrene ceiling tiles,

164
0:07:29.288,000 --> 0:07:31,000
settees permanently sheathed

165
0:07:31.576,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in their transparent covers that they were delivered in.

166
0:07:34.948,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But what's more difficult to navigate

167
0:07:36.8,000 --> 0:07:37,000
is the emotional landscape

168
0:07:38.292,000 --> 0:07:39,000
between the generations,

169
0:07:40.262,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and the old adage that with age comes wisdom

170
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:47,000
is not true.

171
0:07:47.045,000 --> 0:07:5,000
With age comes the veneer of respectability

172
0:07:50.528,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and a veneer of uncomfortable truths.

173
0:07:53.896,000 --> 0:07:55,000
But what was true was that my parents,

174
0:07:56.668,000 --> 0:07:58,000
my mother, and my father went along with it,

175
0:07:59.144,000 --> 0:08:01,000
did not trust the state to educate me.

176
0:08:01.912,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So listen to how I sound.

177
0:08:04.402,000 --> 0:08:08,000
They determined that they would send me to a private school,

178
0:08:08.684,000 --> 0:08:09,000
but my father worked at Vauxhall Motors.

179
0:08:10.441,000 --> 0:08:13,000
It's quite difficult to fund a private school education

180
0:08:14.232,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and feed his army of children.

181
0:08:16.872,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I remember going on to the school

182
0:08:18.856,000 --> 0:08:2,000
for the entrance exam, and my father said

183
0:08:20.98,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to the priest — it was a Catholic school —

184
0:08:24.58,000 --> 0:08:28,000
he wanted a better "heducation" for the boy,

185
0:08:28.807,000 --> 0:08:3,000
but also, he, my father,

186
0:08:31.735,000 --> 0:08:33,000
never even managed to pass worms,

187
0:08:34.375,000 --> 0:08:36,000
never mind entrance exams.

188
0:08:36.995,000 --> 0:08:37,000
But in order to fund my education,

189
0:08:38.94,000 --> 0:08:4,000
he was going to have to do some dodgy stuff,

190
0:08:41.663,000 --> 0:08:44,000
so my father would fund my education

191
0:08:44.765,000 --> 0:08:47,000
by trading in illicit goods from the back of his car,

192
0:08:48.369,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and that was made even more tricky because

193
0:08:49.801,000 --> 0:08:51,000
my father, that's not his car by the way.

194
0:08:51.961,000 --> 0:08:52,000
My father aspired to have a car like that,

195
0:08:53.769,000 --> 0:08:55,000
but my father had a beaten-up Mini,

196
0:08:55.845,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and he never, being a Jamaican coming to this country,

197
0:09:00.343,000 --> 0:09:02,000
he never had a driving license,

198
0:09:02.696,000 --> 0:09:05,000
he never had any insurance or road tax or MOT.

199
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
He thought, "I know how to drive;

200
0:09:08.199,000 --> 0:09:11,000
why do I need the state's validation?"

201
0:09:11.279,000 --> 0:09:13,000
But it became a little tricky when we were stopped by the police,

202
0:09:13.511,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and we were stopped a lot by the police,

203
0:09:15.724,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and I was impressed by the way

204
0:09:16.941,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that my father dealt with the police.

205
0:09:18.84,000 --> 0:09:2,000
He would promote the policeman immediately,

206
0:09:21.648,000 --> 0:09:25,000
so that P.C. Bloggs became Detective Inspector Bloggs

207
0:09:25.735,000 --> 0:09:26,000
in the course of the conversation

208
0:09:26.919,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and wave us on merrily.

209
0:09:28.903,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So my father was exhibiting what we in Jamaica

210
0:09:30.771,000 --> 0:09:34,000
called "playing fool to catch wise."

211
0:09:34.953,000 --> 0:09:37,000
But it lent also an idea

212
0:09:38.322,000 --> 0:09:39,000
that actually he was being diminished

213
0:09:40.128,000 --> 0:09:42,000
or belittled by the policeman —

214
0:09:42.432,000 --> 0:09:43,000
as a 10-year-old boy, I saw that —

215
0:09:44.249,000 --> 0:09:46,000
but also there was an ambivalence towards authority.

216
0:09:46.82,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So on the one hand, there was

217
0:09:48.465,000 --> 0:09:49,000
a mocking of authority,

218
0:09:50.092,000 --> 0:09:52,000
but on the other hand, there was a deference

219
0:09:52.408,000 --> 0:09:53,000
towards authority,

220
0:09:54.229,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and these Caribbean people

221
0:09:56.184,000 --> 0:10:,000
had an overbearing obedience towards authority,

222
0:10:00.321,000 --> 0:10:02,000
which is very striking, very strange in a way,

223
0:10:02.529,000 --> 0:10:05,000
because migrants are very courageous people.

224
0:10:05.633,000 --> 0:10:07,000
They leave their homes. My father and my mother

225
0:10:08.393,000 --> 0:10:11,000
left Jamaica and they traveled 4,000 miles,

226
0:10:12.32,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and yet they were infantilized by travel.

227
0:10:16.144,000 --> 0:10:17,000
They were timid,

228
0:10:17.912,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and somewhere along the line,

229
0:10:19.361,000 --> 0:10:2,000
the natural order was reversed.

230
0:10:21.202,000 --> 0:10:24,000
The children became the parents to the parent.

231
0:10:26.646,000 --> 0:10:28,000
The Caribbean people came to this country with a five-year plan:

232
0:10:29.143,000 --> 0:10:3,000
they would work, some money, and then go back,

233
0:10:31.142,000 --> 0:10:33,000
but the five years became 10, the 10 became 15,

234
0:10:33.965,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and before you know it, you're changing the wallpaper,

235
0:10:36.31,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and at that point, you know you're here to stay.

236
0:10:39.942,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Although there's still the kind of temporariness

237
0:10:42.406,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that our parents felt about being here,

238
0:10:44.853,000 --> 0:10:48,000
but we children knew that the game was up.

239
0:10:49.04,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I think there was a feeling that

240
0:10:51.798,000 --> 0:10:56,000
they would not be able to continue with the ideals

241
0:10:57.148,000 --> 0:10:59,000
of the life that they expected.

242
0:10:59.155,000 --> 0:11:,000
The reality was very much different.

243
0:11:01.137,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And also, that was true of the reality

244
0:11:03.211,000 --> 0:11:04,000
of trying to educate me.

245
0:11:04.629,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Having started the process, my father did not continue.

246
0:11:08.691,000 --> 0:11:1,000
It was left to my mother to educate me,

247
0:11:11.419,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and as George Lamming would say,

248
0:11:14.14,000 --> 0:11:17,000
it was my mother who fathered me.

249
0:11:17.919,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Even in his absence, that old mantra remained:

250
0:11:20.261,000 --> 0:11:21,000
You are being watched.

251
0:11:21.948,000 --> 0:11:24,000
But such ardent watchfulness can lead to anxiety,

252
0:11:25.15,000 --> 0:11:27,000
so much so that years later, when I was investigating

253
0:11:27.399,000 --> 0:11:28,000
why so many young black men

254
0:11:28.713,000 --> 0:11:3,000
were diagnosed with schizophrenia,

255
0:11:30.844,000 --> 0:11:32,000
six times more than they ought to be,

256
0:11:33.351,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I was not surprised to hear the psychiatrist say,

257
0:11:36.623,000 --> 0:11:4,000
"Black people are schooled in paranoia."

258
0:11:41.081,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And I wonder what Bageye would make of that.

259
0:11:44.952,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Now I also had a 10-year-old son,

260
0:11:47.479,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and turned my attention to Bageye

261
0:11:50.328,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and I went in search of him.

262
0:11:51.704,000 --> 0:11:54,000
He was back in Luton, he was now 82,

263
0:11:55.306,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and I hadn't seen him for 30-odd years,

264
0:11:58.946,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and when he opened the door,

265
0:12:00.544,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I saw this tiny little man with lambent, smiling eyes,

266
0:12:04.448,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and he was smiling, and I'd never seen him smile.

267
0:12:06.791,000 --> 0:12:09,000
I was very disconcerted by that.

268
0:12:09.839,000 --> 0:12:12,000
But we sat down, and he had a Caribbean friend with him,

269
0:12:12.9,000 --> 0:12:14,000
talking some old time talk,

270
0:12:15.455,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and my father would look at me,

271
0:12:17.929,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and he looked at me as if I would

272
0:12:19.583,000 --> 0:12:22,000
miraculously disappear as I had arisen.

273
0:12:23.227,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And he turned to his friend, and he said,

274
0:12:25.463,000 --> 0:12:27,000
"This boy and me have a deep, deep connection,

275
0:12:28.423,000 --> 0:12:3,000
deep, deep connection."

276
0:12:31.383,000 --> 0:12:32,000
But I never felt that connection.

277
0:12:32.78,000 --> 0:12:34,000
If there was a pulse, it was very weak

278
0:12:35.559,000 --> 0:12:37,000
or hardly at all.

279
0:12:38.383,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And I almost felt in the course of that reunion

280
0:12:40.223,000 --> 0:12:44,000
that I was auditioning to be my father's son.

281
0:12:44.84,000 --> 0:12:45,000
When the book came out,

282
0:12:46.832,000 --> 0:12:47,000
it had fair reviews in the national papers,

283
0:12:48.568,000 --> 0:12:51,000
but the paper of choice in Luton is not The Guardian,

284
0:12:51.84,000 --> 0:12:53,000
it's the Luton News,

285
0:12:54.127,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and the Luton News ran the headline about the book,

286
0:12:57.903,000 --> 0:13:02,000
"The Book That May Heal a 32-Year-Old Rift."

287
0:13:03.122,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And I understood that could also represent

288
0:13:06.434,000 --> 0:13:07,000
the rift between one generation and the next,

289
0:13:08.337,000 --> 0:13:12,000
between people like me and my father's generation,

290
0:13:12.341,000 --> 0:13:14,000
but there's no tradition in Caribbean life

291
0:13:14.589,000 --> 0:13:16,000
of memoirs or biographies.

292
0:13:16.693,000 --> 0:13:2,000
It was a tradition that you didn't chat about your business in public.

293
0:13:20.777,000 --> 0:13:24,000
But I welcomed that title, and I thought actually, yes,

294
0:13:25.433,000 --> 0:13:26,000
there is a possibility that this

295
0:13:27.329,000 --> 0:13:31,000
will open up conversations that we'd never had before.

296
0:13:31.522,000 --> 0:13:35,000
This will close the generation gap, perhaps.

297
0:13:35.726,000 --> 0:13:37,000
This could be an instrument of repair.

298
0:13:38.253,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And I even began to feel that this book

299
0:13:40.654,000 --> 0:13:42,000
may be perceived by my father

300
0:13:43.542,000 --> 0:13:47,000
as an act of filial devotion.

301
0:13:47.718,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Poor, deluded fool.

302
0:13:51.453,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Bageye was stung by what he perceived to be

303
0:13:55.494,000 --> 0:13:57,000
the public airing of his shortcomings.

304
0:13:58.353,000 --> 0:14:,000
He was stung by my betrayal,

305
0:14:01.254,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and he went to the newspapers the next day

306
0:14:03.326,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and demanded a right of reply,

307
0:14:04.51,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and he got it with the headline

308
0:14:06.742,000 --> 0:14:09,000
"Bageye Bites Back."

309
0:14:09.902,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And it was a coruscating account of my betrayal.

310
0:14:12.87,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I was no son of his.

311
0:14:15.748,000 --> 0:14:17,000
He recognized in his mind that his colors

312
0:14:17.829,000 --> 0:14:19,000
had been dragged through the mud, and he couldn't allow that.

313
0:14:20.197,000 --> 0:14:22,000
He had to restore his dignity, and he did so,

314
0:14:22.782,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and initially, although I was disappointed,

315
0:14:25.21,000 --> 0:14:26,000
I grew to admire that stance.

316
0:14:26.89,000 --> 0:14:29,000
There was still fire bubbling through his veins,

317
0:14:30.293,000 --> 0:14:33,000
even though he was 82 years old.

318
0:14:33.91,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And if it meant that we would now return

319
0:14:36.472,000 --> 0:14:39,000
to 30 years of silence,

320
0:14:39.703,000 --> 0:14:44,000
my father would say, "If it's so, then it's so."

321
0:14:45.663,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Jamaicans will tell you that there's no such thing as facts,

322
0:14:48.855,000 --> 0:14:5,000
there are only versions.

323
0:14:50.88,000 --> 0:14:52,000
We all tell ourselves the versions of the story

324
0:14:53.361,000 --> 0:14:55,000
that we can best live with.

325
0:14:56.216,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Each generation builds up an edifice

326
0:14:58.743,000 --> 0:15:,000
which they are reluctant or sometimes unable

327
0:15:00.81,000 --> 0:15:02,000
to disassemble,

328
0:15:03.118,000 --> 0:15:06,000
but in the writing, my version of the story

329
0:15:06.764,000 --> 0:15:08,000
began to change,

330
0:15:08.832,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and it was detached from me.

331
0:15:12.826,000 --> 0:15:14,000
I lost my hatred of my father.

332
0:15:15.755,000 --> 0:15:19,000
I did no longer want him to die or to murder him,

333
0:15:20.239,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and I felt free,

334
0:15:24.483,000 --> 0:15:28,000
much freer than I'd ever felt before.

335
0:15:29.347,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And I wonder whether that freedness

336
0:15:31.227,000 --> 0:15:33,000
could be transferred to him.

337
0:15:36.218,000 --> 0:15:4,000
In that initial reunion,

338
0:15:40.57,000 --> 0:15:42,000
I was struck by an idea that I had

339
0:15:42.946,000 --> 0:15:45,000
very few photographs of myself

340
0:15:46.39,000 --> 0:15:48,000
as a young child.

341
0:15:48.764,000 --> 0:15:5,000
This is a photograph of me,

342
0:15:50.954,000 --> 0:15:52,000
nine months old.

343
0:15:53.271,000 --> 0:15:54,000
In the original photograph,

344
0:15:55.193,000 --> 0:15:57,000
I'm being held up by my father, Bageye,

345
0:15:58.146,000 --> 0:16:,000
but when my parents separated, my mother

346
0:16:00.39,000 --> 0:16:02,000
excised him from all aspects of our lives.

347
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
She took a pair of scissors and cut him out of every photograph,

348
0:16:07.224,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and for years, I told myself the truth of this photograph

349
0:16:10.766,000 --> 0:16:13,000
was that you are alone,

350
0:16:13.77,000 --> 0:16:15,000
you are unsupported.

351
0:16:16.57,000 --> 0:16:18,000
But there's another way of looking at this photograph.

352
0:16:18.842,000 --> 0:16:2,000
This is a photograph that has the potential

353
0:16:21.418,000 --> 0:16:23,000
for a reunion,

354
0:16:23.922,000 --> 0:16:25,000
a potential to be reunited with my father,

355
0:16:26.71,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and in my yearning to be held up by my father,

356
0:16:30.774,000 --> 0:16:32,000
I held him up to the light.

357
0:16:33.274,000 --> 0:16:35,000
In that first reunion,

358
0:16:36.21,000 --> 0:16:38,000
it was very awkward and tense moments,

359
0:16:38.512,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and to lessen the tension,

360
0:16:39.854,000 --> 0:16:42,000
we decided to go for a walk.

361
0:16:43.192,000 --> 0:16:45,000
And as we walked, I was struck

362
0:16:45.193,000 --> 0:16:47,000
that I had reverted to being the child

363
0:16:47.464,000 --> 0:16:5,000
even though I was now towering above my father.

364
0:16:50.957,000 --> 0:16:52,000
I was almost a foot taller than my father.

365
0:16:53.208,000 --> 0:16:55,000
He was still the big man,

366
0:16:55.816,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and I tried to match his step.

367
0:17:00.537,000 --> 0:17:01,000
And I realized that he was walking

368
0:17:02.114,000 --> 0:17:04,000
as if he was still under observation,

369
0:17:04.89,000 --> 0:17:06,000
but I admired his walk.

370
0:17:07.801,000 --> 0:17:09,000
He walked like a man

371
0:17:10.129,000 --> 0:17:12,000
on the losing side of the F.A. Cup Final

372
0:17:13,000 --> 0:17:16,000
mounting the steps to collect his condolence medal.

373
0:17:16.952,000 --> 0:17:19,000
There was dignity in defeat.

374
0:17:20.576,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Thank you.

375
0:17:22.993,000 --> 0:17:22,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:16.804,000 --> 0:00:19,000
To understand the world that live in, we tell stories.

3
0:00:20.773,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And while remixing and sharing have come to define

4
0:00:24.243,000 --> 0:00:25,000
the web as we know it,

5
0:00:25.824,000 --> 0:00:28,000
all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools

6
0:00:29.659,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that allow us to make things online.

7
0:00:32.124,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But video has been left out. It arrived on the web

8
0:00:36.206,000 --> 0:00:38,000
in a small box, and there it has remained,

9
0:00:38.952,000 --> 0:00:41,000
completely disconnected from the data and the content

10
0:00:42.041,000 --> 0:00:43,000
all around it.

11
0:00:43.913,000 --> 0:00:44,000
In fact, in over a decade on the web, the only thing

12
0:00:45.825,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that has changed about video is the size of the box

13
0:00:49.421,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and the quality of the picture.

14
0:00:52.298,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Popcorn changes all of that.

15
0:00:55.466,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It's an online tool that allows anyone to combine video

16
0:00:58.579,000 --> 0:01:01,000
with content pulled live directly from the web.

17
0:01:01.964,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Videos created with Popcorn behave like the web itself:

18
0:01:05.499,000 --> 0:01:09,000
dynamic, full of links, and completely remixable,

19
0:01:09.546,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and finally allowed to break free from the frame.

20
0:01:13.845,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I want to give you a demo of a prototype

21
0:01:16.249,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that we're working on that we'll launch later this fall.

22
0:01:18.289,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It will be completely free, and it will work in any browser.

23
0:01:23.235,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So, every Popcorn production begins with the video,

24
0:01:26.301,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and so I've made a short, 20-second clip

25
0:01:28.687,000 --> 0:01:31,000
using a newscaster template that we use in workshops.

26
0:01:32.438,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So let's watch it. We'll go back, and I'll show you how we made it.

27
0:01:36.122,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Hi, and welcome to my newscast.

28
0:01:38.874,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I've added my location with a Google Map,

29
0:01:41.315,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and it's live, so try moving it around.

30
0:01:44.683,000 --> 0:01:47,000
You can add pop-ups with live links and custom icons,

31
0:01:48.075,000 --> 0:01:51,000
or pull in content from any web service, like Flickr,

32
0:01:51.539,000 --> 0:01:55,000
or add articles and blog posts with links out to the full content.

33
0:01:56.369,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So let's go back, and I'll show you what you saw. There was a lot there.

34
0:02:00.008,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So this is the timeline, and if you've ever edited video,

35
0:02:03.434,000 --> 0:02:05,000
you're familiar with this, but instead of clips in the timeline,

36
0:02:06.353,000 --> 0:02:09,000
what you're looking at is web events pulled into the video.

37
0:02:09.939,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now in this Popcorn production we've got

38
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
the title card, we've got a Google Map that shows up

39
0:02:16.083,000 --> 0:02:18,000
picture-in-picture, then Popcorn lets it push

40
0:02:18.57,000 --> 0:02:21,000
outside the frame and take over the whole screen.

41
0:02:21.93,000 --> 0:02:23,000
There are two pop-ups bringing you some other information,

42
0:02:24.599,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and a final article with a link out to the original article.

43
0:02:28.977,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Let's go to this Google Map, and I'll show you how you can edit it.

44
0:02:32.511,000 --> 0:02:35,000
All you do, go into the timeline, double-click the item,

45
0:02:35.76,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and I've set it to Toronto, because that's where I'm from.

46
0:02:38.019,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Let's set it to something else.

47
0:02:41.541,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Popcorn immediately goes out onto the web,

48
0:02:44.672,000 --> 0:02:47,000
talks to Google, grabs the map, and puts it in the display.

49
0:02:47.729,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And it's exactly the same

50
0:02:49.335,000 --> 0:02:5,000
for the people who watch your production.

51
0:02:51.071,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And it's live. It's not an image. So you click on it,

52
0:02:53.582,000 --> 0:02:57,000
you zoom in, right down to street view if you want to.

53
0:02:57.812,000 --> 0:03:,000
Now in the video, I mentioned adding a live feed,

54
0:03:00.819,000 --> 0:03:03,000
which we can do right now, so let's add a live feed

55
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:06,000
from Flickr. Go over to the right-hand side,

56
0:03:06.884,000 --> 0:03:08,000
grab Flickr from the list of options,

57
0:03:09.273,000 --> 0:03:11,000
drag it into the timeline,

58
0:03:11.52,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and put it where you'd like it to go,

59
0:03:13.994,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and it immediately goes out to Flickr and starts pulling in

60
0:03:16.457,000 --> 0:03:19,000
images based on the tags. Now, my developers

61
0:03:19.469,000 --> 0:03:22,000
really like ponies, and so they've set that as the default tag.

62
0:03:23.329,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Let's try something else,

63
0:03:26.445,000 --> 0:03:29,000
maybe something a bit more relevant to today.

64
0:03:30.013,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Now here are live images being pulled straight from the feed.

65
0:03:32.743,000 --> 0:03:33,000
If you come and watch this a week from now,

66
0:03:34.331,000 --> 0:03:35,000
this will be completely different,

67
0:03:35.875,000 --> 0:03:37,000
dynamic, just like the web, and just like the web,

68
0:03:38.384,000 --> 0:03:4,000
everything is sourced, so click your link,

69
0:03:40.436,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and you go straight to Flickr and see the source image.

70
0:03:44.229,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Everything you've seen today is built with the basic

71
0:03:46.475,000 --> 0:03:49,000
building blocks of the web: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

72
0:03:50.035,000 --> 0:03:51,000
That means it's completely remixable. It also means

73
0:03:51.954,000 --> 0:03:53,000
there's no proprietary software. All you need

74
0:03:54.518,000 --> 0:03:56,000
is a web browser.

75
0:03:57.477,000 --> 0:04:,000
So imagine if every video that we watched on the web

76
0:04:00.847,000 --> 0:04:03,000
worked like the web, completely remixable,

77
0:04:03.893,000 --> 0:04:05,000
linked to its source content, and interactive

78
0:04:06.64,000 --> 0:04:08,000
for everyone who views it.

79
0:04:09.021,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I think Popcorn could change the way that we tell stories on

80
0:04:12.017,000 --> 0:04:14,000
the web, and the way we understand the world we live in.

81
0:04:14.395,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Thank you. (Applause)

2
0:00:12.208,000 --> 0:00:16,000
For thousands of years, well, really probably millions of years,

3
0:00:16.667,000 --> 0:00:2,000
our ancestors have looked up at the sky and wondered what's up there,

4
0:00:20.708,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and they've also started to wonder,

5
0:00:23.583,000 --> 0:00:26,000
hmm, could we be alone in this planet?

6
0:00:27.833,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Now, I'm fortunate that I get to get paid to actually ask some of those questions,

7
0:00:33.625,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and sort of bad news for you,

8
0:00:35.083,000 --> 0:00:38,000
your tax dollars are paying me to try to answer some of those questions.

9
0:00:38.542,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But then, about 10 years ago,

10
0:00:40.083,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I was told, I mean asked,

11
0:00:42.917,000 --> 0:00:45,000
if I would start to look at the technology to help get us off planet,

12
0:00:46.75,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and so that's what I'm going to talk to you about today.

13
0:00:49.792,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So playing to the local crowd,

14
0:00:51.625,000 --> 0:00:54,000
this is what it looks like in your day-to-day life in Boston,

15
0:00:55.25,000 --> 0:00:59,000
but as you start to go off planet, things look very, very different.

16
0:01:00.542,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So there we are, hovering above the WGBH studios.

17
0:01:05.75,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And here's a very famous picture of the Earthrise from the Moon,

18
0:01:09.417,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and you can see the Earth starting to recede.

19
0:01:13.125,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And then what I love is this picture

20
0:01:15.208,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that was taken from the surface of Mars looking back at the Earth.

21
0:01:18.375,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Can anyone find the Earth?

22
0:01:21.042,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I'm going to help you out a little.

23
0:01:23.875,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:25.583,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Yeah.

25
0:01:26.875,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The point of showing this is that when people start to go to Mars,

26
0:01:30.458,000 --> 0:01:32,000
they're not going to be able to keep calling in

27
0:01:32.708,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and be micromanaged the way people on a space station are.

28
0:01:35.875,000 --> 0:01:37,000
They're going to have to be independent.

29
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So even though they're up there,

30
0:01:39.583,000 --> 0:01:42,000
there are going to be all sorts of things that they're going to need,

31
0:01:42.875,000 --> 0:01:45,000
just like people on Earth need things like, oh, transportation,

32
0:01:46.375,000 --> 0:01:49,000
life support, food, clothing and so on.

33
0:01:49.917,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But unlike on Earth, they are also going to need oxygen.

34
0:01:52.875,000 --> 0:01:55,000
They're going to have to deal with about a third of the gravity that we have here.

35
0:01:56.792,000 --> 0:01:59,000
They're going to have to worry about habitats, power, heat, light

36
0:01:59.958,000 --> 0:02:,000
and radiation protection,

37
0:02:01.542,000 --> 0:02:04,000
something that we don't actually worry about nearly as much on the Earth,

38
0:02:05.042,000 --> 0:02:08,000
because we have this beautiful atmosphere and magnetosphere.

39
0:02:08.792,000 --> 0:02:12,000
The problem with that is that we also have a lot of constraints.

40
0:02:13.167,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So the biggest one for us is upmass,

41
0:02:16.208,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and the number that I've used for years

42
0:02:18.125,000 --> 0:02:23,000
is it costs about 10,000 dollars to launch a can of Coke into low Earth orbit.

43
0:02:23.708,000 --> 0:02:25,000
The problem is, there you are with 10,000 dollars later,

44
0:02:26.583,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and you're still in low Earth orbit.

45
0:02:28.375,000 --> 0:02:31,000
You're not even at the Moon or Mars or anything else.

46
0:02:31.667,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So you're going to have to try to figure out

47
0:02:34.875,000 --> 0:02:38,000
how to keep the mass as low as possible so you don't have to launch it.

48
0:02:39.792,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But on top of that cost issue with the mass,

49
0:02:43.292,000 --> 0:02:46,000
you also have problems of storage

50
0:02:46.333,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and flexibility and reliability.

51
0:02:48.875,000 --> 0:02:52,000
You can't just get there and say, "Oops, I forgot to bring,"

52
0:02:53.167,000 --> 0:02:56,000
because Amazon.com just does not deliver to Mars.

53
0:02:57.042,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So you better be prepared.

54
0:03:00.833,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So what is the solution for this?

55
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And I'm going to propose to you for the rest of this talk

56
0:03:06.042,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that the solution actually is life,

57
0:03:09.042,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and when you start to look at life as a technology,

58
0:03:11.667,000 --> 0:03:13,000
you realize, ah, that's it,

59
0:03:13.917,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that's exactly what we needed.

60
0:03:15.875,000 --> 0:03:18,000
This plant here, like every person here

61
0:03:18.917,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and every one of your dogs and cats

62
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and plants and so on,

63
0:03:22.792,000 --> 0:03:24,000
all started as a single cell.

64
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So imagine, you're starting as a very low upmass object

65
0:03:29.583,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and then growing into something a good deal bigger.

66
0:03:34.375,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now, my hero Charles Darwin,

67
0:03:37.333,000 --> 0:03:41,000
of course, reminds us that there's no such thing as a designer in biology,

68
0:03:41.958,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but what if we now have the technology

69
0:03:46.375,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to design biology,

70
0:03:48.292,000 --> 0:03:52,000
maybe even design, oh, whole new life-forms

71
0:03:52.583,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that can do things for us that we couldn't have imagined otherwise?

72
0:03:56.542,000 --> 0:04:,000
So years ago, I was asked to start to sell this program,

73
0:04:00.958,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and while I was doing that,

74
0:04:02.542,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I was put in front of a panel at NASA,

75
0:04:06.625,000 --> 0:04:08,000
as you might sort of imagine,

76
0:04:08.958,000 --> 0:04:11,000
a bunch of people in suits and white shirts and pencil protectors,

77
0:04:12.958,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and I did this sort of crazy, wild,

78
0:04:15.208,000 --> 0:04:17,000
"This is all the next great thing,"

79
0:04:17.5,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and I thought they would be blown over,

80
0:04:19.583,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and instead the chairman of the committee just looked at me straight in the eye,

81
0:04:23.417,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and said, "So what's the big idea?"

82
0:04:26.5,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So I was like, "OK, you want Star Trek?

83
0:04:28.708,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We'll do Star Trek."

84
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And so let me tell you what the big idea is.

85
0:04:33.166,000 --> 0:04:37,000
We've used organisms to make biomaterials for years.

86
0:04:37.208,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So here's a great picture taken outside of Glasgow,

87
0:04:41.292,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and you can see lots of great biomaterials there.

88
0:04:43.833,000 --> 0:04:45,000
There are trees that you could use to build houses.

89
0:04:46.417,000 --> 0:04:49,000
There are sheep where you can get your wool from.

90
0:04:50.083,000 --> 0:04:51,000
You could get leather from the sheep.

91
0:04:52.042,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Just quickly glancing around the room, I'll bet there's no one in this room

92
0:04:55.625,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that doesn't have some kind of animal or plant product on them,

93
0:04:58.625,000 --> 0:04:59,000
some kind of biomaterial.

94
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But you know what?

95
0:05:01.333,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We're not going to take sheep and trees and stuff to Mars.

96
0:05:04.458,000 --> 0:05:06,000
That's nuts, because of the upmass problem.

97
0:05:07.208,000 --> 0:05:09,000
But we are going to take things like this.

98
0:05:09.542,000 --> 0:05:1,000
This is Bacillus subtilis.

99
0:05:11.167,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Those white dots that you see are spores.

100
0:05:13.542,000 --> 0:05:17,000
This happens to be a bacterium that can form incredibly resistant spores,

101
0:05:17.583,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and when I say incredibly resistant, they've proven themselves.

102
0:05:21.042,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Bacillus subtilis spores have been flown on what was called LDEF,

103
0:05:24.583,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Long Duration Exposure Facility, for almost six years

104
0:05:28.167,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and some of them survived that in space.

105
0:05:30.542,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Unbelievable, a lot better than any of us can do.

106
0:05:33.458,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So why not just take the capabilities,

107
0:05:37.167,000 --> 0:05:4,000
like to make wood or to make wool or spider silk or whatever,

108
0:05:41.042,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and put them in Bacillus subtilis spores,

109
0:05:43.5,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and take those with you off planet?

110
0:05:47.792,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So what are you going to do when you're off planet?

111
0:05:50.25,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Here's an iconic picture of Buzz Aldrin looking back at the Eagle

112
0:05:54.167,000 --> 0:05:58,000
when he landed, oh, it was almost 50 years ago, on the surface of the Moon.

113
0:05:58.667,000 --> 0:06:,000
Now if you're going to go to the Moon for three days

114
0:06:01.167,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and you're the first person to set foot,

115
0:06:03.125,000 --> 0:06:04,000
yeah, you can live in a tin can,

116
0:06:04.708,000 --> 0:06:08,000
but you wouldn't want to do that for, say, a year and a half.

117
0:06:08.958,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So I did actually a calculation, being in California.

118
0:06:12.417,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I looked at what the average size of a cell at Alcatraz is,

119
0:06:16.917,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and I have news for you,

120
0:06:18.25,000 --> 0:06:22,000
the volume in the Eagle there, in the Lunar Module,

121
0:06:22.375,000 --> 0:06:25,000
was about the size of a cell at Alcatraz

122
0:06:26.083,000 --> 0:06:28,000
if it were only five feet high.

123
0:06:28.208,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So incredibly cramped living quarters.

124
0:06:31.333,000 --> 0:06:34,000
You just can't ask a human to stay in there for long periods of time.

125
0:06:35.25,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So why not take these biomaterials and make something?

126
0:06:39.167,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So here's an image that a colleague of mine

127
0:06:41.583,000 --> 0:06:45,000
who is an architect, Chris Maurer, has done of what we've been proposing,

128
0:06:45.75,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and we'll get to the point

129
0:06:47.042,000 --> 0:06:49,000
of why I've been standing up here holding something

130
0:06:49.5,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that looks like a dried sandwich this whole lecture.

131
0:06:52.625,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So we've proposed that the solution to the habitat problem on Mars

132
0:06:58.125,000 --> 0:07:01,000
could just simply lie in a fungus.

133
0:07:01.75,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So I'm now probably going to turn off everyone

134
0:07:04.458,000 --> 0:07:05,000
from ever eating a mushroom again.

135
0:07:06.375,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So let's talk about fungi for a second.

136
0:07:09.042,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So you're probably familiar with this fruiting body of the fungus.

137
0:07:12.375,000 --> 0:07:13,000
That's the mushroom.

138
0:07:13.708,000 --> 0:07:16,000
But what we're interested in actually is what's beneath the surface there,

139
0:07:17.25,000 --> 0:07:18,000
the mycelium,

140
0:07:18.583,000 --> 0:07:2,000
which are these root hair-like structures

141
0:07:21.042,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that are really the main part of the mushroom.

142
0:07:25.292,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Well, it turns out you can take those --

143
0:07:27.75,000 --> 0:07:28,000
there's a micrograph I did --

144
0:07:29.5,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and you can put them in a mold

145
0:07:32.417,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and give them a little food --

146
0:07:33.917,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and it doesn't take much, you can grow these things on sawdust --

147
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:39,000
so this piece here was grown on sawdust,

148
0:07:39.5,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and that mycelium then will fill that structure

149
0:07:42.958,000 --> 0:07:43,000
to make something.

150
0:07:44.458,000 --> 0:07:47,000
We've actually tried growing mycelium on Mars Simulant.

151
0:07:48.083,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So no one's actually gone to the surface of Mars,

152
0:07:50.417,000 --> 0:07:51,000
but this is a simulated surface of Mars,

153
0:07:52.375,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and you can see those hair-like mycelia out there.

154
0:07:54.75,000 --> 0:07:55,000
It's really amazing stuff.

155
0:07:56.542,000 --> 0:07:58,000
How strong can you make these things?

156
0:07:58.625,000 --> 0:08:,000
Well, you know, I could give you numbers and tests and so on,

157
0:08:01.542,000 --> 0:08:03,000
but I think that's probably the best way to describe it.

158
0:08:04.208,000 --> 0:08:07,000
There's one of my students proving that you can do this.

159
0:08:07.25,000 --> 0:08:1,000
To do this, then, you've got to figure out how to put it in context.

160
0:08:10.5,000 --> 0:08:11,000
How's this actually going to happen?

161
0:08:12.292,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I mean, this is a great idea, Lynn,

162
0:08:14.042,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but how are you going to get from here to there?

163
0:08:16.333,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So what we're saying is you grow up the mycelium in the lab, for example

164
0:08:19.792,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and then you fill up a little structure, maybe a house-like structure that's tiny,

165
0:08:24.667,000 --> 0:08:28,000
that is maybe a double-bagged sort of plastic thing, like an inflatable --

166
0:08:28.958,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I sort of think L.L.Bean when I see this.

167
0:08:31.417,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And then you put it in a rocket ship and you send it off to Mars.

168
0:08:37.125,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Rocket lands,

169
0:08:40.917,000 --> 0:08:41,000
you release the bag

170
0:08:42.792,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and you add a little water,

171
0:08:44.582,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and voila, you've got your habitat.

172
0:08:47.292,000 --> 0:08:48,000
You know, how cool would that be?

173
0:08:49.042,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And the beauty of that is you don't have to take something prebuilt.

174
0:08:52.875,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And so our estimates are that we could save 90 percent of the mass

175
0:08:56.917,000 --> 0:09:,000
that NASA is currently proposing by taking up a big steel structure

176
0:09:01.292,000 --> 0:09:03,000
if we actually grow it on site.

177
0:09:03.708,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So let me give you another big idea.

178
0:09:06.125,000 --> 0:09:07,000
What about digital information?

179
0:09:07.833,000 --> 0:09:1,000
What's really interesting is you have a physical link to your parents

180
0:09:11.333,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and they have a physical link to their parents, and so on,

181
0:09:14.125,000 --> 0:09:16,000
all the way back to the origin of life.

182
0:09:16.292,000 --> 0:09:18,000
You have never broken that continuum.

183
0:09:18.75,000 --> 0:09:2,000
But the fact is that we can do that today.

184
0:09:21.375,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So we have students every day in our labs --

185
0:09:24.375,000 --> 0:09:26,000
students in Boston even do this --

186
0:09:26.958,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that make up DNA sequences

187
0:09:29.958,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and they hit the "send" button

188
0:09:31.75,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and they send them to their local DNA synthesis company.

189
0:09:35.625,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Now once you break that physical link

190
0:09:38.958,000 --> 0:09:39,000
where you're sending it across town,

191
0:09:40.75,000 --> 0:09:42,000
it doesn't matter if you're sending it across the Charles River

192
0:09:43.75,000 --> 0:09:45,000
or if you're sending that information to Mars.

193
0:09:45.958,000 --> 0:09:46,000
You've broken that physical link.

194
0:09:47.583,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So then, once you're on Mars,

195
0:09:49.5,000 --> 0:09:51,000
or across the river or wherever,

196
0:09:51.542,000 --> 0:09:53,000
you can take that digital information,

197
0:09:53.792,000 --> 0:09:55,000
synthesize the physical DNA,

198
0:09:56.292,000 --> 0:09:57,000
put it maybe in another organism

199
0:09:57.917,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and voila, you've got new capabilities there.

200
0:10:00.583,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So again, you've broken that physical link. That's huge.

201
0:10:04.458,000 --> 0:10:05,000
What about chemistry?

202
0:10:05.833,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Biology does chemistry for us on Earth,

203
0:10:08.208,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and again has for literally thousands of years.

204
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I bet virtually everyone in this room has eaten something today

205
0:10:14.458,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that has been made by biology doing chemistry.

206
0:10:17.167,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Let me give you a big hint there.

207
0:10:19.25,000 --> 0:10:2,000
What about another idea?

208
0:10:20.875,000 --> 0:10:23,000
What about using DNA itself to make a wire?

209
0:10:24.208,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Because again, we're trying to miniaturize everything.

210
0:10:26.756,000 --> 0:10:27,000
DNA is really cheap.

211
0:10:28.667,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Strawberries have a gazillion amount of DNA.

212
0:10:31.458,000 --> 0:10:34,000
You know, you could take a strawberry with you, isolate the DNA,

213
0:10:35.042,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and one of my students has figured out a way

214
0:10:38.25,000 --> 0:10:4,000
to take DNA and tweak it a little bit

215
0:10:40.5,000 --> 0:10:44,000
so that you can incorporate silver atoms in very specific places,

216
0:10:44.875,000 --> 0:10:45,000
thus making an electrical wire.

217
0:10:46.875,000 --> 0:10:47,000
How cool is that?

218
0:10:48.583,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So while we're on the subject of metals,

219
0:10:51.375,000 --> 0:10:55,000
we're going to need to use metals for things like integrated circuits.

220
0:10:56.083,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Probably we're going to want it for some structures, and so on.

221
0:10:59.625,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And things like integrated circuits ultimately go bad.

222
0:11:03.208,000 --> 0:11:06,000
We could talk a lot about that, but I'm going to leave it at that,

223
0:11:06.375,000 --> 0:11:07,000
that they do go bad,

224
0:11:08.167,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and so where are you going to get those metals?

225
0:11:10.792,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Yeah, you could try to mine them with heavy equipment,

226
0:11:13.375,000 --> 0:11:15,000
but you get that upmass problem.

227
0:11:15.417,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And I always tell people, the best way to find the metals for a new cell phone

228
0:11:19.292,000 --> 0:11:2,000
is in a dead cell phone.

229
0:11:21.042,000 --> 0:11:24,000
So what if you take biology

230
0:11:24.583,000 --> 0:11:26,000
as the technology to get these metals out?

231
0:11:27.042,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And how do you do this?

232
0:11:28.417,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Well, take a look at the back of a vitamin bottle

233
0:11:31.167,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and you'll get an idea of all the sorts of metals

234
0:11:34.542,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that we actually use in our bodies.

235
0:11:36.917,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So we have a lot of proteins as well as other organisms

236
0:11:40.333,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that can actually specifically bind metals.

237
0:11:43.292,000 --> 0:11:45,000
So what if we now take those proteins

238
0:11:46.083,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and maybe attach them to this fungal mycelium

239
0:11:49.333,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and make a filter so we can start to pull those metals out

240
0:11:52.542,000 --> 0:11:56,000
in a very specific way without big mining equipment,

241
0:11:56.625,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and, even better, we've actually got a proof of concept

242
0:11:59.625,000 --> 0:12:02,000
where we've then taken those metals that we pulled out with proteins

243
0:12:03.583,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and reprinted an integrated circuit using a plasma printer.

244
0:12:07.625,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Again, how cool?

245
0:12:10.208,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Electricity: I was asked by a head of one of the NASA centers

246
0:12:14.667,000 --> 0:12:18,000
if you could ever take chemical energy and turn that into electrical energy.

247
0:12:19.417,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Well, the great news is it's not just the electric eel that does it.

248
0:12:22.667,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Everybody in this room who is still alive and functioning

249
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
is doing that.

250
0:12:27.75,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Part of the food that you've eaten today

251
0:12:29.708,000 --> 0:12:31,000
has gone to operate the nerve cells in your body.

252
0:12:32.667,000 --> 0:12:35,000
But even other organisms, nonsentient ones,

253
0:12:36.125,000 --> 0:12:37,000
are creating electric energy,

254
0:12:37.875,000 --> 0:12:38,000
even bacteria.

255
0:12:39.5,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Some bacteria are very good at making little wires.

256
0:12:42.083,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So if we can harvest that ability

257
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:46,000
of turning chemical energy into electrical energy,

258
0:12:46.792,000 --> 0:12:48,000
again, how cool would that be?

259
0:12:48.917,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So here are some of the big ideas we talked about.

260
0:12:51.292,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Let me try one more: life 2.0.

261
0:12:54.042,000 --> 0:12:58,000
So for example, all of the sugars in our body are right-handed.

262
0:12:59.042,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Why shouldn't we make an organism with left-handed sugars?

263
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Why not make an organism that can do things that no organism can do today?

264
0:13:07.625,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So organisms normally have evolved to live in very specific environments.

265
0:13:12.083,000 --> 0:13:15,000
So here's this lion cub literally up a tree,

266
0:13:15.333,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and I took a picture of him a bit later,

267
0:13:17.375,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and he was a lot happier when he was down on the ground.

268
0:13:20.019,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So organisms are designed for specific environments.

269
0:13:23.083,000 --> 0:13:26,000
But what if you can go back to that idea of synthetic biology

270
0:13:26.25,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and tweak 'em around?

271
0:13:27.583,000 --> 0:13:3,000
So here is one of our favorite places in Yellowstone National Park.

272
0:13:30.792,000 --> 0:13:31,000
This is Octopus Springs.

273
0:13:32.125,000 --> 0:13:33,000
If you tilt your head a little bit,

274
0:13:33.875,000 --> 0:13:36,000
it sort of looks like a body and tentacles coming out.

275
0:13:37.167,000 --> 0:13:39,000
It's above the boiling temperature of water.

276
0:13:39.292,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Those organisms that you see on the edge and the colors

277
0:13:42.542,000 --> 0:13:44,000
actually match the temperatures that are there,

278
0:13:45.167,000 --> 0:13:47,000
very, very high-temperature thermophiles.

279
0:13:48.833,000 --> 0:13:51,000
So why not take organisms that can live at extremes,

280
0:13:51.917,000 --> 0:13:53,000
whether it's high temperature or low temperature

281
0:13:54.208,000 --> 0:13:55,000
or low pH or high pH

282
0:13:55.542,000 --> 0:13:58,000
or high salt or high levels of radiation,

283
0:13:58.583,000 --> 0:14:,000
and take some of those capabilities

284
0:14:00.792,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and put it into other organisms.

285
0:14:02.792,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And this is a project that my students have called,

286
0:14:05.25,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and I love this, the "hell cell."

287
0:14:07.167,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And so we've done that.

288
0:14:08.5,000 --> 0:14:11,000
We've taken organisms and sort of tweaked them and pushed them to the edges.

289
0:14:12.25,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And this is important for getting us off planet

290
0:14:14.583,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and also for understanding what life is like in the universe.

291
0:14:18.167,000 --> 0:14:2,000
So let me give you just a couple of final thoughts.

292
0:14:22.542,000 --> 0:14:24,000
First is this whole idea that we have all these needs

293
0:14:25.542,000 --> 0:14:27,000
for human settlement off planet

294
0:14:27.792,000 --> 0:14:3,000
that are in some ways exactly like we have on the Earth,

295
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:33,000
that we need the food and we need the shelter and so on,

296
0:14:33.875,000 --> 0:14:35,000
but we have very, very different constraints

297
0:14:36.125,000 --> 0:14:4,000
of this upmass problem and the reliability and the flexibility and so on.

298
0:14:40.417,000 --> 0:14:42,000
But because we have these constraints that you don't have here,

299
0:14:43.417,000 --> 0:14:46,000
where you might have to think about the indigenous petrochemical industry,

300
0:14:46.958,000 --> 0:14:47,000
or whatever,

301
0:14:48.708,000 --> 0:14:51,000
you now have constraints that have to unleash creativity.

302
0:14:55.292,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And once you unleash this creativity because you have the new constraints,

303
0:14:59.333,000 --> 0:15:02,000
you're forcing game-changing technological advances

304
0:15:02.958,000 --> 0:15:04,000
that you wouldn't have gotten any other way.

305
0:15:06.917,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Finally, we have to think a little bit,

306
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:14,000
is it a good idea to tinker around with life?

307
0:15:15.083,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Well, the sort of easy answer to that is

308
0:15:18.667,000 --> 0:15:21,000
that probably no one in the room keeps a wolf cub at home,

309
0:15:22.417,000 --> 0:15:24,000
but you might have a puppy or a dog;

310
0:15:25.125,000 --> 0:15:29,000
you probably didn't eat teosinte this summer, but you ate corn.

311
0:15:29.333,000 --> 0:15:32,000
We have been doing genetic modification with organisms

312
0:15:33.208,000 --> 0:15:35,000
for literally 10,000 or more years.

313
0:15:35.583,000 --> 0:15:38,000
This is a different approach, but to say all of a sudden

314
0:15:38.625,000 --> 0:15:4,000
humans should never touch an organism

315
0:15:41.042,000 --> 0:15:42,000
is kinda silly

316
0:15:42.375,000 --> 0:15:44,000
because we have that capability now

317
0:15:44.708,000 --> 0:15:48,000
to do things that are far more beneficial for the planet Earth

318
0:15:49.5,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and for life beyond that.

319
0:15:52.917,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And so then the question is, should we?

320
0:15:54.833,000 --> 0:15:57,000
And of course I feel that not only should we,

321
0:15:57.958,000 --> 0:15:58,000
at least for getting off Earth,

322
0:15:59.667,000 --> 0:16:02,000
but actually if we don't use synthetic biology,

323
0:16:02.708,000 --> 0:16:04,000
we will never solve this upmass problem.

324
0:16:05.208,000 --> 0:16:09,000
So once you think of life as a technology, you've got the solution.

325
0:16:09.958,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And so, with that, I'd like to finish the way I always finish,

326
0:16:13.5,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and say "ad astra," which means, "to the stars."

327
0:16:15.792,000 --> 0:16:16,000
Thank you very much, Boston.

328
0:16:17.25,000 --> 0:16:18,000
(Applause)

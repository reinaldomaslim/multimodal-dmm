1
0:00:13.283,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The FBI is responsible for more terrorism plots

2
0:00:15.504,000 --> 0:00:16,000
in the United States

3
0:00:17.175,000 --> 0:00:19,000
than any other organization.

4
0:00:19.771,000 --> 0:00:2,000
More than al Qaeda,

5
0:00:21.625,000 --> 0:00:22,000
more than al Shabaab,

6
0:00:23.01,000 --> 0:00:24,000
more than the Islamic State,

7
0:00:24.56,000 --> 0:00:26,000
more than all of them combined.

8
0:00:27.354,000 --> 0:00:29,000
This isn't likely how you think about the FBI.

9
0:00:30.011,000 --> 0:00:34,000
You probably think of FBI agents gunning down bad guys like John Dillinger,

10
0:00:34.066,000 --> 0:00:37,000
or arresting corrupt politicians.

11
0:00:37.207,000 --> 0:00:38,000
After the 9/11 terrorist attacks,

12
0:00:38.858,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the FBI became less concerned

13
0:00:40.331,000 --> 0:00:42,000
with gangsters and crooked elected officials.

14
0:00:42.94,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The new target became terrorists,

15
0:00:45.402,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and the pursuit of terrorists has consumed the FBI.

16
0:00:48.823,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Every year, the Bureau spends 3.3 billion dollars

17
0:00:51.618,000 --> 0:00:53,000
on domestic counterterrorism activities.

18
0:00:54.222,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Compare than to just 2.6 billion dollars combined for organized crime,

19
0:00:57.823,000 --> 0:00:59,000
financial fraud, public corruption

20
0:00:59.999,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and all other types of traditional criminal activity.

21
0:01:02.777,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I've spent years pouring through the case files

22
0:01:04.973,000 --> 0:01:06,000
of terrorism prosecutions in the United States,

23
0:01:07.805,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and I've come to the conclusion that the FBI

24
0:01:10.074,000 --> 0:01:13,000
is much better at creating terrorists than it is at catching terrorists.

25
0:01:15.083,000 --> 0:01:17,000
In the 14 years since 9/11,

26
0:01:17.097,000 --> 0:01:2,000
you can count about six real terrorist attacks in the United States.

27
0:01:20.681,000 --> 0:01:23,000
These include the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013,

28
0:01:23.751,000 --> 0:01:24,000
as well as failed attacks,

29
0:01:25.04,000 --> 0:01:27,000
such as the time when a man named Faisal Shahzad

30
0:01:27.505,000 --> 0:01:29,000
tried to deliver a car bomb to Times Square.

31
0:01:30.507,000 --> 0:01:31,000
In those same 14 years,

32
0:01:32.122,000 --> 0:01:33,000
the Bureau, however, has bragged

33
0:01:33.754,000 --> 0:01:35,000
about how it's foiled dozens of terrorism plots.

34
0:01:36.945,000 --> 0:01:4,000
In all, the FBI has arrested more than 175 people

35
0:01:41.183,000 --> 0:01:44,000
in aggressive, undercover conterterrorism stings.

36
0:01:44.629,000 --> 0:01:46,000
These operations, which are usually led by an informant,

37
0:01:47.467,000 --> 0:01:48,000
provide the means and opportunity,

38
0:01:49.293,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and sometimes even the idea,

39
0:01:51.225,000 --> 0:01:53,000
for mentally ill and economically desperate people

40
0:01:54.081,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to become what we now term terrorists.

41
0:01:58.061,000 --> 0:02:,000
After 9/11, the FBI was given an edict:

42
0:02:00.368,000 --> 0:02:01,000
never again.

43
0:02:01.586,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Never another attack on American soil.

44
0:02:04.707,000 --> 0:02:06,000
FBI agents were told to find terrorists before they struck.

45
0:02:07.667,000 --> 0:02:11,000
To do this, agents recruited a network of more than 15,000 informants nationwide,

46
0:02:12.507,000 --> 0:02:14,000
all looking for anyone who might be dangerous.

47
0:02:15.276,000 --> 0:02:17,000
An informant can earn 100,000 dollars or more

48
0:02:17.647,000 --> 0:02:2,000
for every terrorism case they bring to the FBI.

49
0:02:20.752,000 --> 0:02:23,000
That's right, the FBI is paying mostly criminals and con men

50
0:02:24.025,000 --> 0:02:26,000
six figures to spy on communities in the United States,

51
0:02:26.926,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but mostly Muslim American communities.

52
0:02:30.103,000 --> 0:02:33,000
These informants nab people like Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif

53
0:02:33.277,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and Walli Mujahidh.

54
0:02:35.148,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Both are mentally ill.

55
0:02:36.653,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Abdul-Latif had a history of huffing gasoline and attempting suicide.

56
0:02:40.016,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Mujahidh had schizoaffective disorder,

57
0:02:42.537,000 --> 0:02:45,000
he had trouble distinguishing between reality and fantasy.

58
0:02:45.745,000 --> 0:02:47,000
In 2012, the FBI arrested these two men

59
0:02:48.227,000 --> 0:02:51,000
for conspiring to attack a military recruiting station outside Seattle

60
0:02:52.039,000 --> 0:02:56,000
with weapons provided, of course, by the FBI.

61
0:02:56.363,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The FBI's informant was Robert Childs,

62
0:02:59.068,000 --> 0:03:,000
a convicted rapist and child molester

63
0:03:01.027,000 --> 0:03:04,000
who was paid 90,000 dollars for his work on the case.

64
0:03:04.361,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This isn't an outlier.

65
0:03:05.849,000 --> 0:03:08,000
In 2009, an FBI informant who had fled Pakistan on murder charges

66
0:03:09.671,000 --> 0:03:12,000
led four men in a plot to bomb synagogues in the Bronx.

67
0:03:13.575,000 --> 0:03:14,000
The lead defendant was James Cromitie,

68
0:03:15.526,000 --> 0:03:17,000
a broke Walmart employee with a history of mental problems.

69
0:03:18.476,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And the informant had offered him 250,000 dollars

70
0:03:21.201,000 --> 0:03:23,000
if he participated in that plot.

71
0:03:23.587,000 --> 0:03:25,000
There are many more examples.

72
0:03:26.232,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Today, The Intercept published my new story

73
0:03:28.35,000 --> 0:03:31,000
about a counterterrorism sting in Tampa involving Sami Osmakac,

74
0:03:32.065,000 --> 0:03:35,000
a young man who was living near Tampa, Florida.

75
0:03:35.218,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Osmakac also had schizoaffective disorder.

76
0:03:37.89,000 --> 0:03:38,000
He too was broke,

77
0:03:38.895,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and he had no connections to international terrorist groups.

78
0:03:41.932,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Nonetheless,

79
0:03:42.773,000 --> 0:03:45,000
an FBI informant gave him a job, handed him money,

80
0:03:46.617,000 --> 0:03:48,000
introduced him to an undercover agent posing as a terrorist,

81
0:03:49.438,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and lured him in a plot to bomb an Irish bar.

82
0:03:52.727,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But here's what's interesting:

83
0:03:54.684,000 --> 0:03:55,000
The lead undercover agent --

84
0:03:56.138,000 --> 0:03:58,000
you can see him in this picture with his face blurred --

85
0:03:58.776,000 --> 0:04:01,000
would go back to the Tampa field office with his recording equipment on.

86
0:04:02.287,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Behind closed doors,

87
0:04:03.608,000 --> 0:04:06,000
FBI agents admitted that what they were doing was farcical.

88
0:04:06.987,000 --> 0:04:09,000
A federal judge doesn't want you to hear about these conversations.

89
0:04:10.216,000 --> 0:04:13,000
He sealed the transcripts and placed them under a protective order

90
0:04:13.367,000 --> 0:04:16,000
in an attempt to prevent someone like me from doing something like this.

91
0:04:17.574,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Behind closed doors, the lead agent,

92
0:04:19.585,000 --> 0:04:2,000
the squad supervisor,

93
0:04:20.916,000 --> 0:04:21,000
described their would-be terrorist

94
0:04:22.551,000 --> 0:04:24,000
as a "retarded fool who didn't have a pot to piss in."

95
0:04:25.182,000 --> 0:04:26,000
They described his terrorist ambitions

96
0:04:27.009,000 --> 0:04:3,000
as wishy-washy and a pipe dream scenario.

97
0:04:30.998,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But that didn't stop the FBI.

98
0:04:32.756,000 --> 0:04:35,000
They provided Sami Osmakac everything he needed.

99
0:04:36.092,000 --> 0:04:39,000
They gave him a car bomb, they gave him an AK-47,

100
0:04:39.804,000 --> 0:04:41,000
they helped him make a so-called martyrdom video,

101
0:04:42.386,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and they even gave him money for a taxi cab

102
0:04:44.48,000 --> 0:04:46,000
so that he could get to where they wanted him to go.

103
0:04:48.004,000 --> 0:04:49,000
As they were working the sting,

104
0:04:49.814,000 --> 0:04:52,000
the squad supervisor tells his agents he wanted a Hollywood ending.

105
0:04:54.527,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And he got a Hollywood ending.

106
0:04:57.048,000 --> 0:04:59,000
When Sami Osmakac attempted to deliver what he thought

107
0:04:59.609,000 --> 0:05:,000
was a car bomb,

108
0:05:00.905,000 --> 0:05:03,000
he was arrested, convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison.

109
0:05:05.604,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Sami Osmakac isn't alone.

110
0:05:08.223,000 --> 0:05:1,000
He's one of more than 175 so-called terrorists,

111
0:05:10.825,000 --> 0:05:12,000
for whom the FBI has created Hollywood endings.

112
0:05:15.813,000 --> 0:05:17,000
U.S. government officials call this the War on Terror.

113
0:05:18.982,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It's really just theater,

114
0:05:20.759,000 --> 0:05:22,000
a national security theater,

115
0:05:23.089,000 --> 0:05:25,000
with mentally ill men like Sami Osmakac

116
0:05:25.574,000 --> 0:05:28,000
unwitting actors in a carefully choreographed production

117
0:05:28.621,000 --> 0:05:3,000
brought to you by the FBI.

118
0:05:30.829,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Thank you.

119
0:05:31.956,000 --> 0:05:33,000
(Applause)

120
0:05:41.09,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Tom Rielly: So, those are some pretty strong accusations,

121
0:05:44.421,000 --> 0:05:45,000
pretty strong charges.

122
0:05:47.098,000 --> 0:05:48,000
How can you back this up?

123
0:05:48.711,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Trevor Aaronson: My research began in 2010

124
0:05:50.727,000 --> 0:05:53,000
when I received a grant from the Investigative Reporting Program

125
0:05:53.795,000 --> 0:05:53,000
at U.C. Berkeley,

126
0:05:54.73,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and a research assistant and I

127
0:05:56.162,000 --> 0:05:58,000
put together a database of all terrorism prosecutions

128
0:05:58.635,000 --> 0:06:01,000
at the time during the first decade after 9/11.

129
0:06:01.651,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And we used the court file to find out whether

130
0:06:04.458,000 --> 0:06:07,000
the defendants had any connections to international terrorist groups,

131
0:06:07.881,000 --> 0:06:08,000
whether an informant was used,

132
0:06:09.364,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and whether the informant played the role of an agent provocateur

133
0:06:12.506,000 --> 0:06:13,000
by providing the means and opportunity.

134
0:06:14.373,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And we submitted that to the FBI

135
0:06:15.95,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and we asked them to respond to our database.

136
0:06:18.064,000 --> 0:06:19,000
If they believed there were any errors,

137
0:06:20.021,000 --> 0:06:23,000
we asked them to tell us what they were and we'd go back and check

138
0:06:23.154,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and they never challenged any of our findings.

139
0:06:25.382,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Later, I used that data in a magazine article

140
0:06:27.58,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and later in my book,

141
0:06:28.629,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and on appearances on places like CBS and NPR,

142
0:06:31.176,000 --> 0:06:32,000
they were offered that opportunity again

143
0:06:33.083,000 --> 0:06:35,000
to say, "Trevor Aaronson's findings are wrong."

144
0:06:35.333,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And they've never come forward and said,

145
0:06:37.193,000 --> 0:06:39,000
"These are the problems with those findings."

146
0:06:39.314,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So the data has since been used by groups like Human Rights Watch

147
0:06:42.455,000 --> 0:06:44,000
on its recent report on these types of sting operations.

148
0:06:45.157,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And so far, the FBI has never really responded

149
0:06:47.796,000 --> 0:06:5,000
to these charges that it's really not catching terrorists

150
0:06:51.022,000 --> 0:06:53,000
so much as it's catching mentally ill people

151
0:06:53.167,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that it can dress up as terrorists in these types of sting operations.

152
0:06:57.849,000 --> 0:07:,000
TR: So The Intercept is that new investigative journalism website,

153
0:07:01.327,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that's cofounded by Glenn Greenwald.

154
0:07:03.095,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Tell us about your article and why there.

155
0:07:06.674,000 --> 0:07:08,000
TA: The Intercept seemed to be the most logical place for this

156
0:07:09.654,000 --> 0:07:12,000
because my article is really leveraging the fact that

157
0:07:12.723,000 --> 0:07:14,000
a source had leaked to me transcripts of these

158
0:07:15.208,000 --> 0:07:17,000
private FBI conversations that a federal judge had sealed

159
0:07:18.155,000 --> 0:07:2,000
based on the government's claim that their release

160
0:07:20.556,000 --> 0:07:22,000
would irreparably damage the U.S. government's

161
0:07:22.748,000 --> 0:07:24,000
law enforcement strategy.

162
0:07:24.852,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So a place like The Intercept was set up to protect journalists

163
0:07:27.831,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and publish their work

164
0:07:28.89,000 --> 0:07:3,000
when they're dealing with very sensitive matters like this.

165
0:07:31.719,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So my story in The Intercept, which was just published today,

166
0:07:34.618,000 --> 0:07:37,000
tells the story of how Sami Osmakac was set up in this FBI sting

167
0:07:37.953,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and goes into much greater detail.

168
0:07:39.633,000 --> 0:07:41,000
In this talk, I could only highlight the things that they said,

169
0:07:42.597,000 --> 0:07:43,000
such as calling him a "retarded fool."

170
0:07:44.434,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But it was much more elaborate,

171
0:07:45.916,000 --> 0:07:48,000
they went to great lengths to put money in Sami Osmakac's hands,

172
0:07:49.012,000 --> 0:07:52,000
which he then used to purchase weapons from the undercover agent.

173
0:07:52.068,000 --> 0:07:53,000
When he went to trial,

174
0:07:53.208,000 --> 0:07:56,000
the central piece of evidence was that he paid for these weapons,

175
0:07:56.339,000 --> 0:07:58,000
when in truth, these transcripts show how the FBI orchestrated

176
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
someone who was essentially mentally ill and broke

177
0:08:01.66,000 --> 0:08:03,000
to get money to then pay for weapons

178
0:08:03.879,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that they could then charge him in a conspiracy for.

179
0:08:06.387,000 --> 0:08:08,000
TR: One final question.

180
0:08:08.514,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Less than 10 days ago,

181
0:08:10.035,000 --> 0:08:13,000
the FBI arrested some potential ISIS suspects in Brooklyn,

182
0:08:13.187,000 --> 0:08:16,000
saying that they might be headed to Syria,

183
0:08:16.725,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and were those real, or examples of more of the same?

184
0:08:19.622,000 --> 0:08:22,000
TA: Well so far, we only know what's come out in the court file,

185
0:08:22.636,000 --> 0:08:25,000
but they seem to suggest it's another example of the same.

186
0:08:25.641,000 --> 0:08:28,000
These types of sting operations have moved from flavor to flavor.

187
0:08:28.823,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So initially it was al Qaeda plots,

188
0:08:30.991,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and now the Islamic State is the current flavor.

189
0:08:33.305,000 --> 0:08:36,000
What's worth noting about that case is that the three men that were charged

190
0:08:36.874,000 --> 0:08:37,000
only began the plot to go to Syria

191
0:08:38.724,000 --> 0:08:4,000
after the introduction of the FBI informant,

192
0:08:40.801,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and in fact, the FBI informant had helped them with the travel documents

193
0:08:44.251,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that they needed.

194
0:08:45.167,000 --> 0:08:47,000
In kind of a comical turn in that particular case,

195
0:08:47.784,000 --> 0:08:49,000
one of the defendant's mother had found out

196
0:08:49.85,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that he was interested in going to Syria and had hid his passport.

197
0:08:53.016,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So it's unclear that even if he had showed up at the airport,

198
0:08:55.949,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that he ever could have gone anywhere.

199
0:08:57.777,000 --> 0:09:,000
So yes, there are people who might be interested in joining the Islamic State

200
0:09:01.42,000 --> 0:09:02,000
in the United States,

201
0:09:02.428,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and those are people that the United States government should be looking at

202
0:09:06.05,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to see if they're interested in violence here.

203
0:09:08.329,000 --> 0:09:11,000
In this particular case, given the evidence that's so far come out,

204
0:09:11.509,000 --> 0:09:13,000
it suggests the FBI made it possible for these guys

205
0:09:13.904,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to move along in a plan to go to Syria

206
0:09:15.984,000 --> 0:09:17,000
when they were never close to that in the first place.

207
0:09:18.592,000 --> 0:09:2,000
TR: Thanks a lot, that's amazing. TA: Thank you.

208
0:09:20.825,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Applause)

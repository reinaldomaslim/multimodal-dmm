1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
A talk about surgical robots

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
is also a talk about surgery.

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And while I've tried to make my images not too graphic,

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood

5
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
than normal people do,

6
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
because, after all, what a surgeon does to a patient,

7
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
if it were done without consent,

8
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
would be a felony.

9
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Surgeons are the tailors, the plumbers,

10
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
the carpenters -- some would say the butchers --

11
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
of the medical world:

12
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
cutting, reshaping, reforming,

13
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
bypassing, fixing.

14
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
But you need to talk about surgical instruments

15
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and the evolution of surgical technology together.

16
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So in order to give you some kind of a perspective

17
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
of where we are right now

18
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
with surgical robots,

19
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and where we're going to be going in the future,

20
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I want to give you a little bit of perspective

21
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
of how we got to this point,

22
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
how we even came to believe

23
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that surgery was OK,

24
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that this was something that was possible to do,

25
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that this kind of cutting and reforming was OK.

26
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So, a little bit of perspective --

27
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
about 10,000 years of perspective.

28
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
This is a trephinated skull.

29
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And trephination is simply just cutting a hole in the skull.

30
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And many, many hundreds of skulls like this

31
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
have been found in archaeological sites

32
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
all over the world,

33
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
dating back five to 10 thousand years.

34
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Five to 10 thousand years! Now imagine this.

35
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
You are a healer in a Stone Age village.

36
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And you have some guy that you're not quite sure what's wrong with him --

37
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Oliver Sacks is going to be born way in the future.

38
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
He's got some seizure disorder. And you don't understand this.

39
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But you think to yourself,

40
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
"I'm not quite sure what's wrong with this guy.

41
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
But maybe if I cut a hole in his head I can fix it."

42
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Now that is surgical thinking.

44
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Now we've got the dawn of interventional surgery here.

45
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
What is astonishing about this is,

46
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
even though we don't know really how much of this

47
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
was intended to be religious,

48
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
or how much of it was intended to be therapeutic,

49
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
what we can tell is that these patients lived!

50
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Judging by the healing on the borders of these holes,

51
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
they lived days, months, years following trephination.

52
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And so what we are seeing is evidence

53
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
of a refined technique

54
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that was being handed down over thousands and thousands of years,

55
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
all over the world.

56
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
This arose independently at sites everywhere

57
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that had no communication to one another.

58
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
We really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery.

59
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Now we can fast forward many thousands of years

60
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
into the Bronze Age and beyond.

61
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And we see new refined tools coming out.

62
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative

63
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
than their bold, trephinating ancestors.

64
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
These guys confined their surgery

65
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to fairly superficial injuries.

66
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And surgeons were tradesmen,

67
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
rather than physicians.

68
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
This persisted all the way into and through the Renaissance.

69
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
That may have saved the writers,

70
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but it didn't really save the surgeons terribly much.

71
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
They were still a mistrusted lot.

72
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Surgeons still had a bit of a PR problem,

73
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
because the landscape was dominated

74
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
by the itinerant barber surgeon.

75
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
These were folks that traveled from village to village, town to town,

76
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
doing surgery sort of as a form of performance art.

77
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Because we were in the age before anesthesia,

78
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
the agony of the patient

79
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
is really as much of the public spectacle

80
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
as the surgery itself.

81
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
One of the most famous of these guys, Frere Jacques,

82
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
shown here doing a lithotomy --

83
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
which is the removal of the bladder stone,

84
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
one of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time --

85
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
had to take less than two minutes.

86
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
You had to have quite a flair for the dramatic,

87
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and be really, really quick.

88
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And so here you see him doing a lithotomy.

89
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And he is credited with doing over 4,000 of these public surgeries,

90
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
wandering around in Europe,

91
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
which is an astonishing number,

92
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
when you think that surgery must have been a last resort.

93
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I mean who would put themselves through that?

94
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Until anesthesia, the absence of sensation.

95
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
With the demonstration of the Morton Ether Inhaler

96
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
at the Mass. General in 1847,

97
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
a whole new era of surgery was ushered in.

98
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Anesthesia gave surgeons the freedom to operate.

99
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Anesthesia gave them the freedom to experiment,

100
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to start to delve deeper into the body.

101
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
This was truly a revolution in surgery.

102
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But there was a pretty big problem with this.

103
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
After these very long, painstaking operations,

104
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
attempting to cure things they'd never been able to touch before,

105
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the patients died.

106
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
They died of massive infection.

107
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Surgery didn't hurt anymore,

108
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but it killed you pretty quickly.

109
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And infection would continue to claim a majority of surgical patients

110
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
until the next big revolution in surgery,

111
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
which was aseptic technique.

112
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Joseph Lister was aepsis's,

113
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
or sterility's, biggest advocate,

114
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons.

115
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
But eventually they did come around.

116
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
The Mayo brothers came out to visit Lister in Europe.

117
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And they came back to their American clinic and they said

118
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
they had learned it was as important to wash your hands

119
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
before doing surgery

120
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
as it was to wash up afterwards. (Laughter)

121
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Something so simple.

122
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And yet, operative mortality dropped profoundly.

123
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
These surgeries were actually now being effective.

124
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
With the patient insensitive to pain,

125
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and a sterile operating field

126
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
all bets were off, the sky was the limit.

127
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
You could now start doing surgery everywhere,

128
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
on the gut, on the liver,

129
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
on the heart, on the brain.

130
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Transplantation: you could take an organ out of one person,

131
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
you could put it in another person, and it would work.

132
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Surgeons didn't have a problem with respectability anymore;

133
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
they had become gods.

134
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
The era of the "big surgeon, big incision" had arrived,

135
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
but at quite a cost,

136
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
because they are saving lives,

137
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
but not necessarily quality of life,

138
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
because healthy people don't usually need surgery,

139
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that.

140
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
The question had to be asked,

141
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
"Well, can we do these same surgeries

142
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
but through little incisions?"

143
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery:

144
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
surgery with long instruments through small incisions.

145
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And it really changed the landscape of surgery.

146
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years,

147
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique

148
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
until the 1980s,

149
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that,

150
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that allowed this to be done for real operations.

151
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So what you see -- this is now the first surgical image --

152
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
as we're coming down the tube, this is a new entry into the body.

153
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It looks very different from what you're expecting surgery to look like.

154
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We bring instruments in,

155
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
from two separate cuts in the side,

156
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and then you can start manipulating tissue.

157
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Within 10 years of the first gallbladder surgeries

158
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
being done laparoscopically,

159
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
a majority of gallbladder surgeries

160
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
were being done laparoscopically --

161
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
truly a pretty big revolution.

162
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
But there were casualties of this revolution.

163
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
These techniques were a lot harder to learn

164
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
than people had anticipated.

165
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
The learning curve was very long.

166
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And during that learning curve the complications went quite a bit higher.

167
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Surgeons had to give up their 3D vision.

168
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
They had to give up their wrists.

169
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
They had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments.

170
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
This surgeon has over 3,000 hours of laparoscopic experience.

171
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Now this is a particularly frustrating placement of the needle.

172
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
But this is hard.

173
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And one of the reasons why it is so hard

174
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
is because the external ergonomics are terrible.

175
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
You've got these long instruments, and you're working off your centerline.

176
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And the instruments are essentially working backwards.

177
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So what you need to do, to take the capability of your hand,

178
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and put it on the other side of that small incision,

179
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
is you need to put a wrist on that instrument.

180
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And so -- I get to talk about robots --

181
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
the da Vinci robot

182
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
put just that wrist on the other side of that incision.

183
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And so here you're seeing the operation of this wrist.

184
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And now, in contrast to the laparoscopy,

185
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
you can precisely place the needle in your instruments,

186
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and you can pass it all the way through

187
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and follow it in a trajectory.

188
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And the reason why this becomes so much easier

189
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
is -- you can see on the bottom --

190
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
the hands are making the motions,

191
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and the instruments are following those motions exactly.

192
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Now, what you put between those instruments and those hands,

193
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
is a large, fairly complicated robot.

194
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
The surgeon is sitting at a console,

195
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and controlling the robot with these controllers.

196
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And the robot is moving these instruments around,

197
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and powering them, down inside the body.

198
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
You have a 3D camera, so you get a 3D view.

199
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And since this was introduced in 1999,

200
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
a lot of these robots have been out

201
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy,

202
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
which is a prostate deep in the pelvis,

203
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and it requires fine dissection

204
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and delicate manipulation

205
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
to be able to get a good surgical outcome.

206
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
You can also sew bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart

207
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
without cracking the chest.

208
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
This is all done in between the ribs.

209
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And you can go inside the heart itself

210
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and repair the valves from the inside.

211
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
You've got these technologies -- thank you --

212
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
(Applause)

213
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And so you might say, "Wow this is really cool!

214
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
So, smartypants, why isn't all surgery being done this way?"

215
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And there are some reasons, some good reasons.

216
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And cost is one of them.

217
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I talked about the large, complicated robot.

218
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
With all its bells and whistles, one of those robots

219
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon.

220
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
More useful than a solid gold surgeon,

221
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
but, still, it's a fairly big capital investment.

222
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
But once you've got it, your procedure costs do come down.

223
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
But there are other barriers.

224
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So something like a prostatectomy --

225
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
the prostate is small, and it's in one spot,

226
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and you can set your robot up very precisely

227
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
to work in that one spot.

228
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And so it's perfect for something like that.

229
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And in fact if you, or anyone you know,

230
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
had their prostate taken out in the last couple of years,

231
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
chances are it was done with one of these systems.

232
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
But if you need to reach more places than just one,

233
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
you need to move the robot.

234
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And you need to put some new incisions in there.

235
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And you need to re-set it up.

236
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And then you need to add some more ports, and more.

237
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And the problem is it gets time-consuming, and cumbersome.

238
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And for that reason there are many surgeries

239
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that just aren't being done with the da Vinci.

240
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So we had to ask the question, "Well how do we fix that?"

241
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
What if we could change it so that we didn't have to re-set up

242
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
each time we wanted to move somewhere different?

243
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
What if we could bring all the instruments

244
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
in together in one place?

245
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
How would that change the capabilities of the surgeon?

246
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And how would that change the experience for the patient?

247
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Now, to do that,

248
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
we need to be able to bring a camera

249
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and instruments in together through one small tube,

250
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
like that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video.

251
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Or, not so coincidentally, like a tube like this.

252
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So what's going to come out of that tube

253
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
is the debut of this new technology,

254
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere.

255
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Ready? So here it comes.

256
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
This is the camera, and three instruments.

257
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And as you see it come out,

258
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
in order to actually be able to do anything useful,

259
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
it can't all stay clustered up like this.

260
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
It has to be able to come off of the centerline

261
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and then be able to work back toward that centerline.

262
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
He's a cheeky little devil.

263
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
But what this lets you do

264
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
is gives you that all-important traction,

265
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and counter-traction,

266
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
so that you can dissect, so that you can sew,

267
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
so that you can do all the things that you need to do,

268
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
all the surgical tasks.

269
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
But it's all coming in through one incision.

270
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
It's not so simple.

271
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
But it's worth it for the freedom that this gives us

272
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
as we're going around.

273
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
For the patient, however,

274
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
it's transparent. This is all they're going to see.

275
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
It's very exciting to think where we get to go with this.

276
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
We get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery.

277
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
As we take these capabilities, and we get to go to the next places,

278
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be.

279
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And I think to really get the rest of the way

280
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
in that revolution,

281
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
we need to not just take our hands in in new ways,

282
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
we also need to take our eyes in in new ways.

283
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
We need to see beyond the surface.

284
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
We need to be able to guide what we're cutting

285
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
in a much better way.

286
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
This is a cancer surgery.

287
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
One of the problems with this,

288
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
even for surgeons who've been looking at this a lot,

289
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
is you can't see the cancer,

290
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
especially when it's hidden below the surface.

291
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And so what we're starting to do

292
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
is we're starting to inject specially designed markers

293
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
into the bloodstream that will target the cancer.

294
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
It will go, bind to the cancer.

295
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And we can make those markers glow.

296
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And we can take special cameras,

297
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and we can look at it.

298
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Now we know where we need to cut,

299
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
even when it's below the surface.

300
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
We can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site.

301
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And we can follow where they flow out from that tumor site,

302
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
so we can see the first places where that cancer might travel.

303
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
We can inject these dyes into the bloodstream,

304
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
so that when we do a new vessel

305
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and we bypass a blockage on the heart,

306
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
we can see if we actually made the connection,

307
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
before we close that patient back up again --

308
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
something that we haven't been able to do

309
0:15:45.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
without radiation before.

310
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
We can light up tumors

311
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:53,000
like this kidney tumor,

312
0:15:53.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
so that you can exactly see where the boundary is

313
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:16:,000
between the kidney tumor and the kidney you want to leave behind,

314
0:16:00.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
or the liver tumor and the liver you want to leave behind.

315
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And we don't even need to confine ourselves

316
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:1,000
to this macro vision.

317
0:16:10.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
We have flexible microscopic probes

318
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:15,000
that we can bring down into the body.

319
0:16:15.33,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And we can look at cells directly.

320
0:16:18.33,000 --> 0:16:21,000
I'm looking at nerves here. So these are nerves you see, down on the bottom,

321
0:16:21.33,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and the microscope probe that's being held by the robotic hand, up at the top.

322
0:16:25.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
So this is all very prototypey at this point.

323
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:31,000
But you care about nerves, if you are a surgical patient.

324
0:16:31.33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Because they let you keep continence,

325
0:16:34.33,000 --> 0:16:38,000
bladder control, and sexual function after surgery,

326
0:16:38.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
all of which is generally fairly important to the patient.

327
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:48,000
So, with the combination of these technologies

328
0:16:48.33,000 --> 0:16:52,000
we can reach it all, and we can see it all.

329
0:16:52.33,000 --> 0:16:55,000
We can heal the disease.

330
0:16:55.33,000 --> 0:16:59,000
And we can leave the patient whole and intact

331
0:16:59.33,000 --> 0:17:03,000
and functional afterwards.

332
0:17:03.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Now, I've talked about the patient

333
0:17:05.33,000 --> 0:17:08,000
as if the patient is, somehow, someone abstract

334
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:1,000
outside this room.

335
0:17:10.33,000 --> 0:17:13,000
And that is not the case.

336
0:17:13.33,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Many of you, all of you maybe,

337
0:17:16.33,000 --> 0:17:19,000
will at some point, or have already, faced a diagnosis of cancer,

338
0:17:19.33,000 --> 0:17:22,000
or heart disease, or some organ dysfunction

339
0:17:22.33,000 --> 0:17:25,000
that's going to buy you a date with a surgeon.

340
0:17:25.33,000 --> 0:17:29,000
And when you get to that point --

341
0:17:29.33,000 --> 0:17:32,000
I mean, these maladies don't care

342
0:17:32.33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
how many books you've written,

343
0:17:35.33,000 --> 0:17:37,000
how many companies you've started,

344
0:17:37.33,000 --> 0:17:39,000
that Nobel Prize you have yet to win,

345
0:17:39.33,000 --> 0:17:43,000
how much time you planned to spend with your children.

346
0:17:43.33,000 --> 0:17:46,000
These maladies come for us all.

347
0:17:46.33,000 --> 0:17:48,000
And the prospect I'm offering you, of an easier surgery ...

348
0:17:48.33,000 --> 0:17:53,000
is that going to make that diagnosis any less terrifying?

349
0:17:53.33,000 --> 0:17:57,000
I'm not sure I really even want it to.

350
0:17:57.33,000 --> 0:18:,000
Because facing your own mortality

351
0:18:00.33,000 --> 0:18:03,000
causes a re-evaluation of priorities,

352
0:18:03.33,000 --> 0:18:08,000
and a realignment of what your goals are in life, unlike anything else.

353
0:18:08.33,000 --> 0:18:13,000
And I would never want to deprive you of that epiphany.

354
0:18:13.33,000 --> 0:18:16,000
What I want instead,

355
0:18:16.33,000 --> 0:18:21,000
is for you to be whole, intact,

356
0:18:21.33,000 --> 0:18:26,000
and functional enough to go out and save the world,

357
0:18:26.33,000 --> 0:18:29,000
after you've decided you need to do it.

358
0:18:29.33,000 --> 0:18:32,000
And that is my vision for your future.

359
0:18:32.33,000 --> 0:18:34,000
Thank you.

360
0:18:34.33,000 --> 0:18:49,000
(Applause)

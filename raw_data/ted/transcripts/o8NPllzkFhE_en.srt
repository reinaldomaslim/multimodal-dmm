1
0:00:13.46,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Chris Anderson: This is such a strange thing.

2
0:00:15.659,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Your software, Linux, is in millions of computers,

3
0:00:18.841,000 --> 0:00:21,000
it probably powers much of the Internet.

4
0:00:22.412,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And I think that there are, like,

5
0:00:24.199,000 --> 0:00:27,000
a billion and a half active Android devices out there.

6
0:00:27.568,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Your software is in every single one of them.

7
0:00:30.808,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It's kind of amazing.

8
0:00:31.982,000 --> 0:00:36,000
You must have some amazing software headquarters driving all this.

9
0:00:37.041,000 --> 0:00:4,000
That's what I thought -- and I was shocked when I saw a picture of it.

10
0:00:40.371,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I mean, this is --

11
0:00:41.595,000 --> 0:00:43,000
this is the Linux world headquarters.

12
0:00:43.869,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:45.883,000 --> 0:00:49,000
(Applause)

14
0:00:49.913,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Linus Torvalds: It really doesn't look like much.

15
0:00:52.223,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And I have to say,

16
0:00:53.923,000 --> 0:00:56,000
the most interesting part in this picture,

17
0:00:57.767,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that people mostly react to,

18
0:00:59.494,000 --> 0:01:,000
is the walking desk.

19
0:01:00.961,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It is the most interesting part in my office

20
0:01:03.684,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and I'm not actually using it anymore.

21
0:01:05.668,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And I think the two things are related.

22
0:01:09.206,000 --> 0:01:11,000
The way I work is ...

23
0:01:13.245,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I want to not have external stimulation.

24
0:01:18.17,000 --> 0:01:23,000
You can kind of see, on the walls are this light green.

25
0:01:23.461,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I'm told that at mental institutions they use that on the walls.

26
0:01:27.949,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:29.02,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It's like a calming color,

28
0:01:30.829,000 --> 0:01:33,000
it's not something that really stimulates you.

29
0:01:35.064,000 --> 0:01:39,000
What you can't see is the computer here, you only see the screen,

30
0:01:39.513,000 --> 0:01:42,000
but the main thing I worry about in my computer is --

31
0:01:42.918,000 --> 0:01:45,000
it doesn't have to be big and powerful, although I like that --

32
0:01:46.277,000 --> 0:01:48,000
it really has to be completely silent.

33
0:01:49.975,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I know people who work for Google

34
0:01:52.01,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and they have their own small data center at home,

35
0:01:55.241,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and I don't do that.

36
0:01:56.417,000 --> 0:01:59,000
My office is the most boring office you'll ever see.

37
0:02:00.146,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And I sit there alone in the quiet.

38
0:02:04.136,000 --> 0:02:06,000
If the cat comes up,

39
0:02:06.197,000 --> 0:02:07,000
it sits in my lap.

40
0:02:08.058,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And I want to hear the cat purring,

41
0:02:10.272,000 --> 0:02:13,000
not the sound of the fans in the computer.

42
0:02:13.47,000 --> 0:02:14,000
CA: So this is astonishing,

43
0:02:14.803,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because working this way,

44
0:02:17.505,000 --> 0:02:19,000
you're able to run this vast technology empire --

45
0:02:20.517,000 --> 0:02:21,000
it is an empire --

46
0:02:21.762,000 --> 0:02:24,000
so that's an amazing testament to the power of open source.

47
0:02:25.486,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Tell us how you got to understand open source

48
0:02:29.686,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and how it lead to the development of Linux.

49
0:02:33.546,000 --> 0:02:34,000
LT: I mean, I still work alone.

50
0:02:35.075,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Really -- I work alone in my house,

51
0:02:38.666,000 --> 0:02:39,000
often in my bathrobe.

52
0:02:40.08,000 --> 0:02:42,000
When a photographer shows up, I dress up,

53
0:02:42.665,000 --> 0:02:43,000
so I have clothes on.

54
0:02:43.975,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:45.236,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And that's how I've always worked.

56
0:02:47.332,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I mean, this was how I started Linux, too.

57
0:02:49.364,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I did not start Linux as a collaborative project.

58
0:02:53.037,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I started it as one in a series of many projects

59
0:02:57.939,000 --> 0:03:,000
I had done at the time for myself,

60
0:03:01.92,000 --> 0:03:02,000
partly because I needed the end result,

61
0:03:03.846,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but even more because I just enjoyed programming.

62
0:03:06.172,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So it was about the end of the journey,

63
0:03:10.57,000 --> 0:03:13,000
which, 25 years later, we still have not reached.

64
0:03:13.94,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But it was really about the fact that I was looking for a project on my own

65
0:03:17.681,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and there was no open source, really, on my radar at all.

66
0:03:21.988,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And what happened is ...

67
0:03:24.668,000 --> 0:03:28,000
the project grows and becomes something you want to show off to people.

68
0:03:30.552,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Really, this is more of a, "Wow, look at what I did!"

69
0:03:34.693,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And trust me -- it was not that great back then.

70
0:03:38.128,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I made it publicly available,

71
0:03:40.026,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and it wasn't even open source at that point.

72
0:03:42.156,000 --> 0:03:47,000
At that point it was source that was open, but there was no intention

73
0:03:47.349,000 --> 0:03:52,000
behind using the kind of open-source methodology that we think of today

74
0:03:52.487,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to improve it.

75
0:03:53.662,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It was more like,

76
0:03:54.837,000 --> 0:03:56,000
"Look, I've been working on this for half a year,

77
0:03:58.459,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I'd love to have comments."

78
0:04:00.717,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And other people approached me.

79
0:04:03.217,000 --> 0:04:04,000
At the University of Helsinki,

80
0:04:04.893,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I had a friend who was one of the open source --

81
0:04:08.632,000 --> 0:04:11,000
it was called mainly "free software" back then --

82
0:04:12.312,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and he actually introduced me to the notion that, hey,

83
0:04:16.61,000 --> 0:04:21,000
you can use these open-source licenses that had been around.

84
0:04:24.114,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And I thought about it for a while.

85
0:04:26.179,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I was actually worried about the whole commercial interests coming in.

86
0:04:29.694,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I mean, that's one of the worries I think most people who start out have,

87
0:04:34.192,000 --> 0:04:38,000
is that they worry about somebody taking advantage of their work, right?

88
0:04:39.603,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And I decided, "What the hell?"

89
0:04:43.74,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And --

90
0:04:44.914,000 --> 0:04:45,000
CA: And then at some point,

91
0:04:46.233,000 --> 0:04:48,000
someone contributed some code that you thought,

92
0:04:48.717,000 --> 0:04:51,000
"Wow, that really is interesting, I would not have thought of that.

93
0:04:51.912,000 --> 0:04:52,000
This could actually improve this."

94
0:04:53.587,000 --> 0:04:55,000
LT: It didn't even start by people contributing code,

95
0:04:56.136,000 --> 0:04:58,000
it was more that people started contributing ideas.

96
0:04:59.748,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And just the fact that somebody else takes a look at your project --

97
0:05:03.018,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and I'm sure it's true of other things, too,

98
0:05:05.59,000 --> 0:05:06,000
but it's definitely true in code --

99
0:05:07.451,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is that somebody else takes an interest in your code,

100
0:05:10.974,000 --> 0:05:12,000
looks at it enough to actually give you feedback

101
0:05:13.52,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and give you ideas.

102
0:05:15.433,000 --> 0:05:16,000
That was a huge thing for me.

103
0:05:17.158,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I was 21 at the time, so I was young,

104
0:05:20.374,000 --> 0:05:23,000
but I had already programmed for half my life, basically.

105
0:05:24.372,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And every project before that had been completely personal

106
0:05:28.368,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and it was a revelation when people just started commenting,

107
0:05:31.499,000 --> 0:05:34,000
started giving feedback on your code.

108
0:05:34.824,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And even before they started giving code back,

109
0:05:38.62,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that was, I think, one of the big moments where I said,

110
0:05:41.385,000 --> 0:05:42,000
"I love other people!"

111
0:05:43.282,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Don't get me wrong --

112
0:05:44.463,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I'm actually not a people person.

113
0:05:46.111,000 --> 0:05:49,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:49.5,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I don't really love other people --

115
0:05:52.076,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:53.12,000 --> 0:05:54,000
But I love computers,

117
0:05:54.77,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I love interacting with other people on email,

118
0:05:57.009,000 --> 0:06:,000
because it kind of gives you that buffer.

119
0:06:00.365,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But I do love other people who comment and get involved in my project.

120
0:06:06.89,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And it made it so much more.

121
0:06:09.273,000 --> 0:06:11,000
CA: So was there a moment when you saw what was being built

122
0:06:12.131,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and it suddenly started taking off,

123
0:06:14.362,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and you thought, "Wait a sec, this actually could be something huge,

124
0:06:17.676,000 --> 0:06:19,000
not just a personal project that I'm getting nice feedback on,

125
0:06:20.612,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but a kind of explosive development in the whole technology world"?

126
0:06:25.821,000 --> 0:06:26,000
LT: Not really.

127
0:06:27.004,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I mean, the big point for me, really, was not when it was becoming huge,

128
0:06:30.6,000 --> 0:06:32,000
it was when it was becoming little.

129
0:06:33.709,000 --> 0:06:36,000
The big point for me was not being alone

130
0:06:37.25,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and having 10, maybe 100 people being involved --

131
0:06:40.991,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that was a big point.

132
0:06:42.494,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Then everything else was very gradual.

133
0:06:45.557,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Going from 100 people to a million people is not a big deal -- to me.

134
0:06:49.84,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Well, I mean, maybe it is if you're --

135
0:06:51.697,000 --> 0:06:52,000
(Laughter)

136
0:06:52.722,000 --> 0:06:54,000
If you want to sell your result then it's a huge deal --

137
0:06:55.464,000 --> 0:06:56,000
don't get me wrong.

138
0:06:56.639,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But if you're interested in the technology

139
0:06:58.79,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and you're interested in the project,

140
0:07:00.669,000 --> 0:07:01,000
the big part was getting the community.

141
0:07:02.574,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Then the community grew gradually.

142
0:07:04.222,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And there's actually not a single point where I went like,

143
0:07:08.166,000 --> 0:07:1,000
"Wow, that just took off!" because it --

144
0:07:10.366,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I mean -- it took a long time, relatively.

145
0:07:13.714,000 --> 0:07:15,000
CA: So all the technologists that I talk to really credit you

146
0:07:16.714,000 --> 0:07:18,000
with massively changing their work.

147
0:07:19.612,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And it's not just Linux,

148
0:07:21.259,000 --> 0:07:22,000
it's this thing called Git,

149
0:07:22.729,000 --> 0:07:26,000
which is this management system for software development.

150
0:07:26.765,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Tell us briefly about that and your role in that.

151
0:07:30.481,000 --> 0:07:31,000
LT: So one of the issues we had,

152
0:07:32.294,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and this took a while to start to appear,

153
0:07:35.37,000 --> 0:07:36,000
is when you ...

154
0:07:37.708,000 --> 0:07:42,000
When you grow from having 10 people or 100 people working on a project

155
0:07:43.064,000 --> 0:07:45,000
to having 10,000 people, which --

156
0:07:45.476,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I mean, right now we're in the situation where just on the kernel,

157
0:07:48.966,000 --> 0:07:51,000
we have 1,000 people involved in every single release

158
0:07:52.164,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and that's every two months, roughly two or three months.

159
0:07:56.336,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Some of those people don't do a lot.

160
0:07:58.781,000 --> 0:08:,000
There's a lot of people who make small, small changes.

161
0:08:01.388,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But to maintain this,

162
0:08:03.658,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the scale changes how you have to maintain it.

163
0:08:06.571,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And we went through a lot of pain.

164
0:08:10.713,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And there are whole projects that do only source-code maintenance.

165
0:08:17.266,000 --> 0:08:2,000
CVS is the one that used to be the most commonly used,

166
0:08:20.582,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and I hated CVS with a passion and refused to touch it

167
0:08:24.503,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and tried something else that was radical and interesting

168
0:08:27.59,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and everybody else hated.

169
0:08:31.004,000 --> 0:08:32,000
CA: (Laughs)

170
0:08:32.402,000 --> 0:08:34,000
LT: And we were in this bad spot,

171
0:08:34.514,000 --> 0:08:36,000
where we had thousands of people who wanted to participate,

172
0:08:37.355,000 --> 0:08:42,000
but in many ways, I was the kind of break point,

173
0:08:42.42,000 --> 0:08:44,000
where I could not scale to the point

174
0:08:44.968,000 --> 0:08:46,000
where I could work with thousands of people.

175
0:08:47.792,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So Git is my second big project,

176
0:08:50.268,000 --> 0:08:54,000
which was only created for me to maintain my first big project.

177
0:08:55.433,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And this is literally how I work.

178
0:08:57.704,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I don't code for --

179
0:09:00.233,000 --> 0:09:01,000
well, I do code for fun --

180
0:09:01.979,000 --> 0:09:03,000
but I want to code for something meaningful

181
0:09:04.384,000 --> 0:09:08,000
so every single project I've ever done has been something I needed

182
0:09:08.455,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and --

183
0:09:09.855,000 --> 0:09:12,000
CA: So really, both Linux and Git kind of arose

184
0:09:13.312,000 --> 0:09:15,000
almost as an unintended consequence

185
0:09:15.672,000 --> 0:09:17,000
of your desire not to have to work with too many people.

186
0:09:18.367,000 --> 0:09:19,000
LT: Absolutely. Yes.

187
0:09:19.542,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Laughter)

188
0:09:20.646,000 --> 0:09:21,000
CA: That's amazing. LT: Yeah.

189
0:09:22.32,000 --> 0:09:23,000
(Applause)

190
0:09:23.836,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And yet, you're the man who's transformed technology

191
0:09:27.251,000 --> 0:09:28,000
not just once but twice,

192
0:09:28.592,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and we have to try and understand why it is.

193
0:09:31.199,000 --> 0:09:32,000
You've given us some clues, but ...

194
0:09:32.907,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Here's a picture of you as a kid, with a Rubik's Cube.

195
0:09:37.572,000 --> 0:09:41,000
You mentioned that you've been programming since you were like 10 or 11,

196
0:09:41.716,000 --> 0:09:42,000
half your life.

197
0:09:43.105,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Were you this sort of computer genius, you know, übernerd,

198
0:09:46.945,000 --> 0:09:48,000
were you the star at school who could do everything?

199
0:09:49.454,000 --> 0:09:5,000
What were you like as a kid?

200
0:09:52.13,000 --> 0:09:54,000
LT: Yeah, I think I was the prototypical nerd.

201
0:09:54.647,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I mean, I was ...

202
0:09:57.13,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I was not a people person back then.

203
0:09:59.116,000 --> 0:10:01,000
That's my younger brother.

204
0:10:01.72,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I was clearly more interested in the Rubik's Cube

205
0:10:04.531,000 --> 0:10:05,000
than my younger brother.

206
0:10:06.08,000 --> 0:10:07,000
(Laughter)

207
0:10:07.191,000 --> 0:10:1,000
My younger sister, who's not in the picture,

208
0:10:10.335,000 --> 0:10:12,000
when we had family meetings --

209
0:10:12.773,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and it's not a huge family, but I have, like, a couple of cousins --

210
0:10:16.589,000 --> 0:10:18,000
she would prep me beforehand.

211
0:10:19.477,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Like, before I stepped into the room she would say,

212
0:10:22.067,000 --> 0:10:24,000
"OK. That's so-and-so ..."

213
0:10:25.925,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Because I was not --

214
0:10:28.278,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I was a geek.

215
0:10:29.517,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I was into computers,

216
0:10:30.707,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I was into math,

217
0:10:31.89,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I was into physics.

218
0:10:33.065,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I was good at that.

219
0:10:34.24,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I don't think I was particularly exceptional.

220
0:10:37.554,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Apparently, my sister said

221
0:10:39.969,000 --> 0:10:45,000
that my biggest exceptional quality was that I would not let go.

222
0:10:47.618,000 --> 0:10:49,000
CA: OK, so let's go there, because that's interesting.

223
0:10:50.199,000 --> 0:10:51,000
You would not let go.

224
0:10:51.397,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So that's not about being a geek and being smart,

225
0:10:54.286,000 --> 0:10:57,000
that's about being ... stubborn?

226
0:10:57.415,000 --> 0:10:58,000
LT: That's about being stubborn.

227
0:10:58.966,000 --> 0:10:59,000
That's about, like,

228
0:11:01.093,000 --> 0:11:03,000
just starting something

229
0:11:03.317,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and not saying, "OK, I'm done, let's do something else --

230
0:11:08.791,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Look: shiny!"

231
0:11:10.954,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And I notice that in many other parts in my life, too.

232
0:11:15.47,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I lived in Silicon Valley for seven years.

233
0:11:18.744,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And I worked for the same company, in Silicon Valley,

234
0:11:22.88,000 --> 0:11:23,000
for the whole time.

235
0:11:24.618,000 --> 0:11:25,000
That is unheard of.

236
0:11:27.204,000 --> 0:11:28,000
That's not how Silicon Valley works.

237
0:11:28.995,000 --> 0:11:31,000
The whole point of Silicon Valley is that people jump between jobs

238
0:11:32.598,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to kind of mix up the pot.

239
0:11:35.249,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And that's not the kind of person I am.

240
0:11:37.153,000 --> 0:11:39,000
CA: But during the actual development of Linux itself,

241
0:11:39.748,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that stubbornness sometimes brought you in conflict with other people.

242
0:11:44.445,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Talk about that a bit.

243
0:11:46.123,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Was that essential to sort of maintain the quality of what was being built?

244
0:11:51.691,000 --> 0:11:53,000
How would you describe what happened?

245
0:11:54.392,000 --> 0:11:56,000
LT: I don't know if it's essential.

246
0:11:57.239,000 --> 0:12:,000
Going back to the "I'm not a people person," --

247
0:12:00.408,000 --> 0:12:01,000
sometimes I'm also ...

248
0:12:04.1,000 --> 0:12:05,000
shall we say,

249
0:12:05.657,000 --> 0:12:08,000
"myopic" when it comes to other people's feelings,

250
0:12:09.667,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and that sometimes makes you say things that hurt other people.

251
0:12:14.969,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And I'm not proud of that.

252
0:12:18.761,000 --> 0:12:19,000
(Applause)

253
0:12:19.899,000 --> 0:12:2,000
But, at the same time, it's --

254
0:12:22.978,000 --> 0:12:25,000
I get people who tell me that I should be nice.

255
0:12:26.796,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And then when I try to explain to them that maybe you're nice,

256
0:12:32.488,000 --> 0:12:34,000
maybe you should be more aggressive,

257
0:12:34.766,000 --> 0:12:37,000
they see that as me being not nice.

258
0:12:38.332,000 --> 0:12:4,000
(Laughter)

259
0:12:40.466,000 --> 0:12:42,000
What I'm trying to say is we are different.

260
0:12:42.658,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I'm not a people person;

261
0:12:44.492,000 --> 0:12:46,000
it's not something I'm particularly proud of,

262
0:12:46.622,000 --> 0:12:47,000
but it's part of me.

263
0:12:48.186,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And one of the things I really like about open source

264
0:12:50.915,000 --> 0:12:55,000
is it really allows different people to work together.

265
0:12:56.731,000 --> 0:12:57,000
We don't have to like each other --

266
0:12:58.479,000 --> 0:13:,000
and sometimes we really don't like each other.

267
0:13:00.706,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Really -- I mean, there are very, very heated arguments.

268
0:13:04.217,000 --> 0:13:06,000
But you can, actually, you can find things that --

269
0:13:08.327,000 --> 0:13:1,000
you don't even agree to disagree,

270
0:13:10.578,000 --> 0:13:13,000
it's just that you're interested in really different things.

271
0:13:13.648,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And coming back to the point where I said earlier

272
0:13:16.575,000 --> 0:13:2,000
that I was afraid of commercial people taking advantage of your work,

273
0:13:20.892,000 --> 0:13:22,000
it turned out, and very quickly turned out,

274
0:13:23.515,000 --> 0:13:25,000
that those commercial people were lovely, lovely people.

275
0:13:26.505,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And they did all the things that I was not at all interested in doing,

276
0:13:30.235,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and they had completely different goals.

277
0:13:32.316,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And they used open source in ways that I just did not want to go.

278
0:13:37.663,000 --> 0:13:39,000
But because it was open source they could do it,

279
0:13:39.949,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and it actually works really beautifully together.

280
0:13:42.325,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And I actually think it works the same way.

281
0:13:44.373,000 --> 0:13:47,000
You need to have the people-people, the communicators,

282
0:13:47.602,000 --> 0:13:48,000
the warm and friendly people

283
0:13:49.053,000 --> 0:13:5,000
who like --

284
0:13:50.799,000 --> 0:13:51,000
(Laughter)

285
0:13:52.265,000 --> 0:13:55,000
really want to hug you and get you into the community.

286
0:13:55.339,000 --> 0:13:56,000
But that's not everybody.

287
0:13:56.934,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And that's not me.

288
0:13:58.39,000 --> 0:13:59,000
I care about the technology.

289
0:13:59.871,000 --> 0:14:,000
There are people who care about the UI.

290
0:14:01.776,000 --> 0:14:04,000
I can't do UI to save my life.

291
0:14:04.87,000 --> 0:14:07,000
I mean, if I was stranded on an island

292
0:14:07.915,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and the only way to get off that island was the make a pretty UI,

293
0:14:11.339,000 --> 0:14:12,000
I'd die there.

294
0:14:12.526,000 --> 0:14:13,000
(Laughter)

295
0:14:13.701,000 --> 0:14:15,000
So there's different kinds of people,

296
0:14:15.864,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and I'm not making excuses, I'm trying to explain.

297
0:14:18.753,000 --> 0:14:19,000
CA: Now, when we talked last week,

298
0:14:20.443,000 --> 0:14:22,000
you talked about some other trait that you have,

299
0:14:22.952,000 --> 0:14:23,000
which I found really interesting.

300
0:14:24.567,000 --> 0:14:25,000
It's this idea called taste.

301
0:14:25.974,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And I've just got a couple of images here.

302
0:14:28.354,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I think this is an example of not particularly good taste in code,

303
0:14:32.381,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and this one is better taste,

304
0:14:35.396,000 --> 0:14:37,000
which one can immediately see.

305
0:14:37.483,000 --> 0:14:38,000
What is the difference between these two?

306
0:14:40.639,000 --> 0:14:41,000
LT: So this is --

307
0:14:41.845,000 --> 0:14:43,000
How many people here actually have coded?

308
0:14:45.671,000 --> 0:14:46,000
CA: Oh my goodness.

309
0:14:47.215,000 --> 0:14:48,000
LT: So I guarantee you,

310
0:14:48.394,000 --> 0:14:49,000
everybody who raised their hand,

311
0:14:49.963,000 --> 0:14:51,000
they have done what's called a singly-linked list.

312
0:14:52.608,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And it's taught --

313
0:14:55.115,000 --> 0:14:58,000
This, the first not very good taste approach,

314
0:14:58.73,000 --> 0:15:02,000
is basically how it's taught to be done when you start out coding.

315
0:15:02.821,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And you don't have to understand the code.

316
0:15:04.889,000 --> 0:15:06,000
The most interesting part to me

317
0:15:06.969,000 --> 0:15:08,000
is the last if statement.

318
0:15:10.933,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Because what happens in a singly-linked list --

319
0:15:13.217,000 --> 0:15:16,000
this is trying to remove an existing entry from a list --

320
0:15:16.891,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and there's a difference between if it's the first entry

321
0:15:20.757,000 --> 0:15:21,000
or whether it's an entry in the middle.

322
0:15:22.78,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Because if it's the first entry,

323
0:15:24.409,000 --> 0:15:27,000
you have to change the pointer to the first entry.

324
0:15:27.449,000 --> 0:15:28,000
If it's in the middle,

325
0:15:28.671,000 --> 0:15:3,000
you have to change the pointer of a previous entry.

326
0:15:31.116,000 --> 0:15:33,000
So they're two completely different cases.

327
0:15:33.164,000 --> 0:15:34,000
CA: And that's better.

328
0:15:34.34,000 --> 0:15:35,000
LT: And this is better.

329
0:15:35.94,000 --> 0:15:37,000
It does not have the if statement.

330
0:15:38.637,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And it doesn't really matter --

331
0:15:40.874,000 --> 0:15:43,000
I don't want you understand why it doesn't have the if statement,

332
0:15:44.099,000 --> 0:15:45,000
but I want you to understand

333
0:15:45.465,000 --> 0:15:47,000
that sometimes you can see a problem in a different way

334
0:15:48.114,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and rewrite it so that a special case goes away

335
0:15:51.492,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and becomes the normal case.

336
0:15:53.393,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And that's good code.

337
0:15:55.328,000 --> 0:15:56,000
But this is simple code.

338
0:15:56.902,000 --> 0:15:57,000
This is CS 101.

339
0:15:58.275,000 --> 0:16:,000
This is not important -- although, details are important.

340
0:16:01.798,000 --> 0:16:05,000
To me, the sign of people I really want to work with

341
0:16:05.9,000 --> 0:16:07,000
is that they have good taste, which is how ...

342
0:16:09.295,000 --> 0:16:1,000
I sent you this stupid example

343
0:16:10.916,000 --> 0:16:12,000
that is not relevant because it's too small.

344
0:16:13.743,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Good taste is much bigger than this.

345
0:16:15.909,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Good taste is about really seeing the big patterns

346
0:16:19.954,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and kind of instinctively knowing what's the right way to do things.

347
0:16:24.436,000 --> 0:16:26,000
CA: OK, so we're putting the pieces together here now.

348
0:16:27.736,000 --> 0:16:28,000
You have taste,

349
0:16:30.057,000 --> 0:16:32,000
in a way that's meaningful to software people.

350
0:16:32.418,000 --> 0:16:33,000
You're --

351
0:16:33.593,000 --> 0:16:34,000
(Laughter)

352
0:16:35.433,000 --> 0:16:37,000
LT: I think it was meaningful to some people here.

353
0:16:39.967,000 --> 0:16:41,000
CA: You're a very smart computer coder,

354
0:16:42.908,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and you're hellish stubborn.

355
0:16:45.622,000 --> 0:16:46,000
But there must be something else.

356
0:16:47.232,000 --> 0:16:48,000
I mean, you've changed the future.

357
0:16:48.879,000 --> 0:16:5,000
You must have the ability of these grand visions of the future.

358
0:16:51.866,000 --> 0:16:52,000
You're a visionary, right?

359
0:16:53.151,000 --> 0:16:55,000
LT: I've actually felt slightly uncomfortable at TED

360
0:16:55.766,000 --> 0:16:57,000
for the last two days,

361
0:16:57.95,000 --> 0:16:59,000
because there's a lot of vision going on, right?

362
0:17:00.569,000 --> 0:17:01,000
And I am not a visionary.

363
0:17:02.29,000 --> 0:17:04,000
I do not have a five-year plan.

364
0:17:04.543,000 --> 0:17:05,000
I'm an engineer.

365
0:17:05.925,000 --> 0:17:06,000
And I think it's really --

366
0:17:07.209,000 --> 0:17:09,000
I mean -- I'm perfectly happy with all the people

367
0:17:09.552,000 --> 0:17:11,000
who are walking around and just staring at the clouds

368
0:17:12.327,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and looking at the stars and saying, "I want to go there."

369
0:17:15.202,000 --> 0:17:16,000
But I'm looking at the ground,

370
0:17:16.678,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and I want to fix the pothole that's right in front of me

371
0:17:19.557,000 --> 0:17:2,000
before I fall in.

372
0:17:20.941,000 --> 0:17:21,000
This is the kind of person I am.

373
0:17:22.584,000 --> 0:17:23,000
(Cheers)

374
0:17:23.719,000 --> 0:17:24,000
(Applause)

375
0:17:25.055,000 --> 0:17:28,000
CA: So you spoke to me last week about these two guys.

376
0:17:29.358,000 --> 0:17:31,000
Who are they and how do you relate to them?

377
0:17:32.239,000 --> 0:17:35,000
LT: Well, so this is kind of cliché in technology,

378
0:17:35.865,000 --> 0:17:37,000
the whole Tesla versus Edison,

379
0:17:37.896,000 --> 0:17:41,000
where Tesla is seen as the visionary scientist and crazy idea man.

380
0:17:42.861,000 --> 0:17:44,000
And people love Tesla.

381
0:17:45.667,000 --> 0:17:47,000
I mean, there are people who name their companies after him.

382
0:17:48.678,000 --> 0:17:49,000
(Laughter)

383
0:17:51.365,000 --> 0:17:53,000
The other person there is Edison,

384
0:17:54.001,000 --> 0:17:57,000
who is actually often vilified for being kind of pedestrian

385
0:17:57.532,000 --> 0:17:58,000
and is --

386
0:17:59.477,000 --> 0:18:01,000
I mean, his most famous quote is,

387
0:18:02.223,000 --> 0:18:06,000
"Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration."

388
0:18:07.394,000 --> 0:18:08,000
And I'm in the Edison camp,

389
0:18:08.871,000 --> 0:18:1,000
even if people don't always like him.

390
0:18:11.079,000 --> 0:18:14,000
Because if you actually compare the two,

391
0:18:14.122,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Tesla has kind of this mind grab these days,

392
0:18:18.679,000 --> 0:18:19,000
but who actually changed the world?

393
0:18:21.853,000 --> 0:18:24,000
Edison may not have been a nice person,

394
0:18:25.259,000 --> 0:18:28,000
he did a lot of things --

395
0:18:28.415,000 --> 0:18:3,000
he was maybe not so intellectual,

396
0:18:30.868,000 --> 0:18:32,000
not so visionary.

397
0:18:33.119,000 --> 0:18:36,000
But I think I'm more of an Edison than a Tesla.

398
0:18:37.669,000 --> 0:18:39,000
CA: So our theme at TED this week is dreams --

399
0:18:40.131,000 --> 0:18:41,000
big, bold, audacious dreams.

400
0:18:41.502,000 --> 0:18:42,000
You're really the antidote to that.

401
0:18:43.328,000 --> 0:18:45,000
LT: I'm trying to dial it down a bit, yes.

402
0:18:45.461,000 --> 0:18:46,000
CA: That's good.

403
0:18:46.636,000 --> 0:18:47,000
(Laughter)

404
0:18:47.74,000 --> 0:18:48,000
We embrace you, we embrace you.

405
0:18:51.046,000 --> 0:18:53,000
Companies like Google and many others have made, arguably,

406
0:18:53.819,000 --> 0:18:55,000
like, billions of dollars out of your software.

407
0:18:56.049,000 --> 0:18:57,000
Does that piss you off?

408
0:18:57.224,000 --> 0:18:58,000
LT: No.

409
0:18:58.399,000 --> 0:19:,000
No, it doesn't piss me off for several reasons.

410
0:19:01.057,000 --> 0:19:03,000
And one of them is, I'm doing fine.

411
0:19:03.091,000 --> 0:19:04,000
I'm really doing fine.

412
0:19:04.942,000 --> 0:19:05,000
But the other reason is --

413
0:19:06.55,000 --> 0:19:11,000
I mean, without doing the whole open source and really letting go thing,

414
0:19:11.901,000 --> 0:19:13,000
Linux would never have been what it is.

415
0:19:14.151,000 --> 0:19:19,000
And it's brought experiences I don't really enjoy, public talking,

416
0:19:19.271,000 --> 0:19:21,000
but at the same time, this is an experience.

417
0:19:21.446,000 --> 0:19:22,000
Trust me.

418
0:19:23.238,000 --> 0:19:28,000
So there's a lot of things going on that make me a very happy man

419
0:19:28.405,000 --> 0:19:3,000
and thinking I did the right choices.

420
0:19:30.958,000 --> 0:19:31,000
CA: Is the open source idea --

421
0:19:32.894,000 --> 0:19:33,000
this is, I think we'll end here --

422
0:19:34.554,000 --> 0:19:38,000
is the open source idea fully realized now in the world,

423
0:19:38.632,000 --> 0:19:41,000
or is there more that it could go,

424
0:19:41.674,000 --> 0:19:43,000
are there more things that it could do?

425
0:19:44.738,000 --> 0:19:46,000
LT: So, I'm of two minds there.

426
0:19:46.996,000 --> 0:19:5,000
I think one reason open source works so well in code

427
0:19:51.506,000 --> 0:19:53,000
is that at the end of the day,

428
0:19:53.939,000 --> 0:19:56,000
code tends to be somewhat black and white.

429
0:19:57.209,000 --> 0:20:01,000
There's often a fairly good way to decide,

430
0:20:01.39,000 --> 0:20:04,000
this is done correctly and this is not done well.

431
0:20:05.36,000 --> 0:20:07,000
Code either works or it doesn't,

432
0:20:07.762,000 --> 0:20:11,000
which means that there's less room for arguments.

433
0:20:12.394,000 --> 0:20:15,000
And we have arguments despite this, right?

434
0:20:16.049,000 --> 0:20:17,000
In many other areas --

435
0:20:17.988,000 --> 0:20:2,000
I mean, people have talked about open politics and things like that --

436
0:20:21.753,000 --> 0:20:23,000
and it's really hard sometimes to say

437
0:20:24.726,000 --> 0:20:27,000
that, yes, you can apply the same principles in some other areas

438
0:20:28.507,000 --> 0:20:33,000
just because the black and white turns into not just gray,

439
0:20:33.97,000 --> 0:20:34,000
but different colors.

440
0:20:36.339,000 --> 0:20:4,000
So, obviously open source in science is making a comeback.

441
0:20:40.729,000 --> 0:20:41,000
Science was there first.

442
0:20:42.387,000 --> 0:20:44,000
But then science ended up being pretty closed,

443
0:20:45.078,000 --> 0:20:48,000
with very expensive journals and some of that going on.

444
0:20:48.726,000 --> 0:20:51,000
And open source is making a comeback in science,

445
0:20:52.586,000 --> 0:20:56,000
with things like arXiv and open journals.

446
0:20:59.262,000 --> 0:21:,000
Wikipedia changed the world, too.

447
0:21:01.239,000 --> 0:21:02,000
So there are other examples,

448
0:21:02.717,000 --> 0:21:03,000
I'm sure there are more to come.

449
0:21:05.66,000 --> 0:21:06,000
CA: But you're not a visionary,

450
0:21:07.251,000 --> 0:21:08,000
and so it's not up to you to name them.

451
0:21:09.228,000 --> 0:21:1,000
LT: No.

452
0:21:10.411,000 --> 0:21:11,000
(Laughter)

453
0:21:11.483,000 --> 0:21:12,000
It's up to you guys to make them, right?

454
0:21:13.471,000 --> 0:21:14,000
CA: Exactly.

455
0:21:14.758,000 --> 0:21:15,000
Linus Torvalds,

456
0:21:15.94,000 --> 0:21:17,000
thank you for Linux, thank you for the Internet,

457
0:21:18.209,000 --> 0:21:19,000
thank you for all those Android phones.

458
0:21:20.098,000 --> 0:21:23,000
Thank you for coming here to TED and revealing so much of yourself.

459
0:21:23.319,000 --> 0:21:24,000
LT: Thank you.

460
0:21:24.495,000 --> 0:21:28,000
(Applause)

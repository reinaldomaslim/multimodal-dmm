1
0:00:12.761,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I want to tell you three stories

2
0:00:15.273,000 --> 0:00:17,000
about the power of relationships

3
0:00:17.749,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to solve the deep and complex social problems of this century.

4
0:00:22.062,000 --> 0:00:24,000
You know, sometimes it seems like all these problems

5
0:00:24.999,000 --> 0:00:28,000
of poverty, inequality, ill health, unemployment, violence, addiction --

6
0:00:29.812,000 --> 0:00:31,000
they're right there in one person's life.

7
0:00:32.662,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So I want to tell you about someone like this that I know.

8
0:00:36.367,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I'm going to call her Ella.

9
0:00:38.46,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Ella lives in a British city on a run down estate.

10
0:00:42.19,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The shops are closed, the pub's gone,

11
0:00:44.408,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the playground's pretty desolate and never used,

12
0:00:46.731,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and inside Ella's house, the tension is palpable

13
0:00:49.581,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and the noise levels are deafening.

14
0:00:51.605,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The TV's on at full volume.

15
0:00:53.443,000 --> 0:00:55,000
One of her sons is fighting with one of her daughters.

16
0:00:55.999,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Another son, Ryan, is keeping up this constant stream of abuse from the kitchen,

17
0:00:59.794,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and the dogs are locked behind the bedroom door and straining.

18
0:01:02.999,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Ella is stuck.

19
0:01:04.735,000 --> 0:01:06,000
She has lived with crisis for 40 years.

20
0:01:07.319,000 --> 0:01:1,000
She knows nothing else, and she knows no way out.

21
0:01:11.077,000 --> 0:01:13,000
She's had a whole series of abusive partners,

22
0:01:13.75,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and, tragically, one of her children has been taken into care by social services.

23
0:01:18.091,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The three children that still live with her

24
0:01:20.387,000 --> 0:01:23,000
suffer from a whole range of problems, and none of them are in education.

25
0:01:23.886,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And Ella says to me that she is repeating the cycle

26
0:01:26.907,000 --> 0:01:28,000
of her own mother's life before her.

27
0:01:29.695,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But when I met Ella, there were 73 different services

28
0:01:32.999,000 --> 0:01:35,000
on offer for her and her family in the city where she lives,

29
0:01:36.161,000 --> 0:01:4,000
73 different services run out of 24 departments in one city,

30
0:01:40.454,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and Ella and her partners and her children were known to most of them.

31
0:01:43.788,000 --> 0:01:45,000
They think nothing of calling social services

32
0:01:45.926,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to try and mediate one of the many arguments that broke out.

33
0:01:48.802,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And the family home was visited on a regular basis by social workers,

34
0:01:52.275,000 --> 0:01:56,000
youth workers, a health officer, a housing officer, a home tutor

35
0:01:56.999,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and the local policemen.

36
0:01:58.999,000 --> 0:02:,000
And the governments say that there are 100,000 families

37
0:02:01.761,000 --> 0:02:03,000
in Britain today like Ella's,

38
0:02:03.884,000 --> 0:02:08,000
struggling to break the cycle of economic, social and environmental deprivation.

39
0:02:09.269,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And they also say that managing this problem

40
0:02:11.467,000 --> 0:02:14,000
costs a quarter of a million pounds per family per year

41
0:02:14.493,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and yet nothing changes.

42
0:02:15.889,000 --> 0:02:18,000
None of these well-meaning visitors are making a difference.

43
0:02:18.999,000 --> 0:02:22,000
This is a chart we made in the same city with another family like Ella's.

44
0:02:23.306,000 --> 0:02:26,000
This shows 30 years of intervention in that family's life.

45
0:02:26.932,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And just as with Ella, not one of these interventions is part of an overall plan.

46
0:02:30.787,000 --> 0:02:31,000
There's no end goal in sight.

47
0:02:32.258,000 --> 0:02:35,000
None of the interventions are dealing with the underlying issues.

48
0:02:35.333,000 --> 0:02:38,000
These are just containment measures, ways of managing a problem.

49
0:02:38.367,000 --> 0:02:39,000
One of the policemen says to me,

50
0:02:40.11,000 --> 0:02:42,000
"Look, I just deliver the message and then I leave."

51
0:02:42.623,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So, I've spent time living with families like Ella's

52
0:02:45.332,000 --> 0:02:46,000
in different parts of the world,

53
0:02:46.896,000 --> 0:02:48,000
because I want to know: what can we learn

54
0:02:49.158,000 --> 0:02:52,000
from places where our social institutions just aren't working?

55
0:02:52.675,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I want to know what it feels like to live in Ella's family.

56
0:02:55.49,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I want to know what's going on and what we can do differently.

57
0:02:59.525,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Well, the first thing I learned is that cost is a really slippery concept.

58
0:03:03.638,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Because when the government says that a family like Ella's

59
0:03:06.38,000 --> 0:03:08,000
costs a quarter of a million pounds a year to manage,

60
0:03:09.001,000 --> 0:03:1,000
what it really means

61
0:03:10.176,000 --> 0:03:12,000
is that this system costs a quarter of a million pounds a year.

62
0:03:13.17,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Because not one penny of this money actually touches Ella's family

63
0:03:16.309,000 --> 0:03:17,000
in a way that makes a difference.

64
0:03:17.913,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Instead, the system is just like this costly gyroscope

65
0:03:20.48,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that spins around the families, keeping them stuck at its heart,

66
0:03:23.483,000 --> 0:03:25,000
exactly where they are.

67
0:03:25.532,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And I also spent time with the frontline workers,

68
0:03:27.879,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and I learned that it is an impossible situation.

69
0:03:30.726,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So Tom, who is the social worker for Ella's 14-year-old son Ryan,

70
0:03:35.465,000 --> 0:03:38,000
has to spend 86 percent of his time servicing the system:

71
0:03:38.999,000 --> 0:03:4,000
meetings with colleagues, filling out forms,

72
0:03:41.094,000 --> 0:03:43,000
more meetings with colleagues to discuss the forms,

73
0:03:43.546,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and maybe most shockingly,

74
0:03:44.816,000 --> 0:03:46,000
the 14 percent of the time he has to be with Ryan

75
0:03:47.409,000 --> 0:03:49,000
is spent getting data and information for the system.

76
0:03:49.929,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So he says to Ryan,

77
0:03:51.104,000 --> 0:03:53,000
"How often have you been smoking? Have you been drinking?

78
0:03:53.815,000 --> 0:03:54,000
When did you go to school?"

79
0:03:55.152,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And this kind of interaction rules out the possibility

80
0:03:57.726,000 --> 0:03:58,000
of a normal conversation.

81
0:03:58.962,000 --> 0:04:,000
It rules out the possibility of what's needed

82
0:04:01.104,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to build a relationship between Tom and Ryan.

83
0:04:04.999,000 --> 0:04:05,000
When we made this chart,

84
0:04:06.412,000 --> 0:04:08,000
the frontline workers, the professionals --

85
0:04:08.451,000 --> 0:04:09,000
they stared at it absolutely amazed.

86
0:04:10.246,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It snaked around the walls of their offices.

87
0:04:12.999,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So many hours, so well meant, but ultimately so futile.

88
0:04:18.999,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And there was this moment of absolute breakdown,

89
0:04:22.463,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and then of clarity:

90
0:04:24.319,000 --> 0:04:26,000
we had to work in a different way.

91
0:04:27.652,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So in a really brave step, the leaders of the city where Ella lives

92
0:04:30.981,000 --> 0:04:32,000
agreed that we could start by reversing Ryan's ratio.

93
0:04:33.65,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So everyone who came into contact with Ella or a family like Ella's

94
0:04:36.834,000 --> 0:04:38,000
would spend 80 percent of their time working with the families

95
0:04:39.77,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and only 20 percent servicing the system.

96
0:04:42.359,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And even more radically,

97
0:04:44.234,000 --> 0:04:45,000
the families would lead

98
0:04:45.428,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and they would decide who was in a best position to help them.

99
0:04:48.779,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So Ella and another mother were asked to be part of an interview panel,

100
0:04:52.162,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to choose from amongst the existing professionals

101
0:04:54.509,000 --> 0:04:56,000
who would work with them.

102
0:04:56.8,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And many, many people wanted to join us,

103
0:04:58.79,000 --> 0:05:01,000
because you don't go into this kind of work to manage a system,

104
0:05:01.885,000 --> 0:05:03,000
you go in because you can and you want to make a difference.

105
0:05:04.762,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So Ella and the mother asked everybody who came through the door,

106
0:05:07.999,000 --> 0:05:09,000
"What will you do when my son starts kicking me?"

107
0:05:10.455,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And so the first person who comes in says,

108
0:05:12.999,000 --> 0:05:14,000
"Well, I'll look around for the nearest exit

109
0:05:15.142,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and I will back out very slowly,

110
0:05:17.999,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and if the noise is still going on, I'll call my supervisor."

111
0:05:21.024,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And the mothers go, "You're the system. Get out of here!"

112
0:05:23.761,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And then the next person who comes is a policeman, and he says,

113
0:05:26.999,000 --> 0:05:29,000
"Well, I'll tackle your son to the ground and then I'm not sure what I'll do."

114
0:05:30.999,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And the mothers say, "Thank you."

115
0:05:32.701,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So, they chose professionals who confessed

116
0:05:34.947,000 --> 0:05:35,000
they didn't necessarily have the answers,

117
0:05:36.941,000 --> 0:05:39,000
who said -- well, they weren't going to talk in jargon.

118
0:05:40.554,000 --> 0:05:42,000
They showed their human qualities and convinced the mothers

119
0:05:43.467,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that they would stick with them through thick and thin,

120
0:05:46.104,000 --> 0:05:48,000
even though they wouldn't be soft with them.

121
0:05:48.187,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So these new teams and the families

122
0:05:49.903,000 --> 0:05:51,000
were then given a sliver of the former budget,

123
0:05:52.086,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but they could spend the money in any way they chose.

124
0:05:54.601,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And so one of the families went out for supper.

125
0:05:56.86,000 --> 0:05:59,000
They went to McDonald's and they sat down and they talked and they listened

126
0:06:00.489,000 --> 0:06:02,000
for the first time in a long time.

127
0:06:02.573,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Another family asked the team

128
0:06:04.187,000 --> 0:06:07,000
if they would help them do up their home.

129
0:06:07.253,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And one mother took the money

130
0:06:08.784,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and she used it as a float to start a social enterprise.

131
0:06:12.335,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And in a really short space of time,

132
0:06:14.808,000 --> 0:06:16,000
something new started to grow:

133
0:06:17.241,000 --> 0:06:19,000
a relationship between the team and the workers.

134
0:06:20.163,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And then some remarkable changes took place.

135
0:06:23.104,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Maybe it's not surprising

136
0:06:24.648,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that the journey for Ella has had some big steps backwards

137
0:06:27.406,000 --> 0:06:28,000
as well as forwards.

138
0:06:28.591,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But today, she's completed an IT training course,

139
0:06:31.38,000 --> 0:06:34,000
she has her first paid job, her children are back in school,

140
0:06:34.692,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and the neighbors,

141
0:06:35.867,000 --> 0:06:37,000
who previously just hoped this family would be moved anywhere

142
0:06:38.8,000 --> 0:06:39,000
except next door to them,

143
0:06:40.03,000 --> 0:06:41,000
are fine.

144
0:06:41.205,000 --> 0:06:43,000
They've made some new friendships.

145
0:06:43.329,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And all the same people have been involved in this transformation --

146
0:06:47.369,000 --> 0:06:49,000
same families, same workers.

147
0:06:49.999,000 --> 0:06:52,000
But the relationship between them has been supported to change.

148
0:06:54.556,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So I'm telling you about Ella because I think that relationships

149
0:06:57.661,000 --> 0:06:58,000
are the critical resource we have

150
0:06:59.622,000 --> 0:07:01,000
in solving some of these intractable problems.

151
0:07:02.024,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But today, our relationships are all but written off

152
0:07:04.77,000 --> 0:07:07,000
by our politics, our social policies, our welfare institutions.

153
0:07:08.662,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And I've learned that this really has to change.

154
0:07:12.002,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So what do I mean by relationships?

155
0:07:14.411,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I'm talking about the simple human bonds between us,

156
0:07:17.439,000 --> 0:07:19,000
a kind of authentic sense of connection, of belonging,

157
0:07:19.999,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the bonds that make us happy, that support us to change,

158
0:07:22.707,000 --> 0:07:24,000
to be brave like Ella and try something new.

159
0:07:25.535,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And, you know, it's no accident

160
0:07:27.479,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that those who run and work in the institutions

161
0:07:30.042,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that are supposed to support Ella and her family

162
0:07:32.324,000 --> 0:07:33,000
don't talk about relationships,

163
0:07:33.862,000 --> 0:07:37,000
because relationships are expressly designed out of a welfare model

164
0:07:37.958,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that was drawn up in Britain and exported around the world.

165
0:07:41.44,000 --> 0:07:42,000
The contemporaries of William Beveridge,

166
0:07:43.397,000 --> 0:07:45,000
who was the architect of the first welfare state

167
0:07:45.679,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and the author of the Beveridge Report,

168
0:07:47.623,000 --> 0:07:5,000
had little faith in what they called the average sensual or emotional man.

169
0:07:51.146,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Instead, they trusted this idea of the impersonal system

170
0:07:54.614,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and the bureaucrat who would be detached and work in this system.

171
0:07:58.999,000 --> 0:08:,000
And the impact of Beveridge

172
0:08:01.138,000 --> 0:08:03,000
on the way the modern state sees social issues

173
0:08:03.405,000 --> 0:08:05,000
just can't be underestimated.

174
0:08:05.488,000 --> 0:08:08,000
The Beveridge Report sold over 100,000 copies

175
0:08:08.688,000 --> 0:08:1,000
in the first weeks of publication alone.

176
0:08:11.041,000 --> 0:08:14,000
People queued in the rain on a November night to get hold of a copy,

177
0:08:14.274,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and it was read across the country, across the colonies, across Europe,

178
0:08:17.664,000 --> 0:08:18,000
across the United States of America,

179
0:08:19.429,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and it had this huge impact

180
0:08:21.225,000 --> 0:08:24,000
on the way that welfare states were designed around the globe.

181
0:08:24.846,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The cultures, the bureaucracies, the institutions -- they are global,

182
0:08:29.931,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and they've come to seem like common sense.

183
0:08:31.975,000 --> 0:08:33,000
They've become so ingrained in us,

184
0:08:34.083,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that actually we don't even see them anymore.

185
0:08:36.856,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And I think it's really important to say that in the 20th century,

186
0:08:39.999,000 --> 0:08:41,000
they were remarkably successful, these institutions.

187
0:08:42.66,000 --> 0:08:45,000
They led to longer lifespans, the eradication of mass disease,

188
0:08:46.115,000 --> 0:08:48,000
mass housing, almost universal education.

189
0:08:49.999,000 --> 0:08:5,000
But at the same time,

190
0:08:51.999,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Beveridge sowed the seeds of today's challenges.

191
0:08:55.999,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So let me tell you a second story.

192
0:08:57.787,000 --> 0:09:02,000
What do you think today is a bigger killer than a lifetime of smoking?

193
0:09:05.226,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It's loneliness.

194
0:09:07.741,000 --> 0:09:11,000
According to government statistics, one person over 60 -- one in three --

195
0:09:12.681,000 --> 0:09:15,000
doesn't speak to or see another person in a week.

196
0:09:16.666,000 --> 0:09:19,000
One person in 10, that's 850,000 people,

197
0:09:19.999,000 --> 0:09:21,000
doesn't speak to anyone else in a month.

198
0:09:22.924,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And we're not the only people with this problem;

199
0:09:25.222,000 --> 0:09:27,000
this problem touches the whole of the Western world.

200
0:09:27.677,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And it's even more acute in countries like China,

201
0:09:29.999,000 --> 0:09:32,000
where a process of rapid urbanization, mass migration, has left older people

202
0:09:33.706,000 --> 0:09:34,000
alone in the villages.

203
0:09:35.274,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And so the services that Beveridge designed and exported --

204
0:09:39.119,000 --> 0:09:41,000
they can't address this kind of problem.

205
0:09:41.43,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Loneliness is like a collective relational challenge,

206
0:09:44.064,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and it can't be addressed by a traditional bureaucratic response.

207
0:09:48.486,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So some years ago, wanting to understand this problem,

208
0:09:51.461,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I started to work with a group of about 60 older people

209
0:09:54.358,000 --> 0:09:55,000
in South London, where I live.

210
0:09:56.203,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I went shopping, I played bingo,

211
0:09:58.302,000 --> 0:10:,000
but mainly I was just observing and listening.

212
0:10:00.489,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I wanted to know what we could do differently.

213
0:10:03.837,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And if you ask them, people tell you they want two things.

214
0:10:06.689,000 --> 0:10:08,000
They want somebody to go up a ladder and change a light bulb,

215
0:10:09.622,000 --> 0:10:11,000
or to be there when they come out of hospital.

216
0:10:11.944,000 --> 0:10:13,000
They want on-demand, practical support.

217
0:10:14.322,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And they want to have fun.

218
0:10:15.904,000 --> 0:10:18,000
They want to go out, do interesting things with like-minded people,

219
0:10:19.146,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and make friends like we've all made friends at every stage of our lives.

220
0:10:23.478,000 --> 0:10:25,000
So we rented a phone line, hired a couple of handymen,

221
0:10:26.231,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and started a service we called "Circle."

222
0:10:28.592,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And Circle offers its local membership a toll-free 0 800 number

223
0:10:32.437,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that they can call on demand for any support.

224
0:10:35.19,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And people have called us for so many reasons.

225
0:10:37.383,000 --> 0:10:39,000
They've called because their pets are unwell,

226
0:10:39.526,000 --> 0:10:42,000
their DVD is broken, they've forgotten how to use their mobile phone,

227
0:10:42.824,000 --> 0:10:43,000
or maybe they are coming out of hospital

228
0:10:44.773,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and they want someone to be there.

229
0:10:46.45,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And Circle also offers a rich social calendar --

230
0:10:49.624,000 --> 0:10:53,000
knitting, darts, museum tours, hot air ballooning -- you name it.

231
0:10:54.255,000 --> 0:10:58,000
But here's the interesting thing, the really deep change:

232
0:10:58.674,000 --> 0:11:01,000
over time, the friendships that have formed

233
0:11:01.909,000 --> 0:11:03,000
have begun to replace the practical offer.

234
0:11:04.964,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So let me tell you about Belinda.

235
0:11:06.621,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Belinda's a Circle member, and she was going into hospital for a hip operation,

236
0:11:10.881,000 --> 0:11:13,000
so she called her local Circle to say they wouldn't see her for a bit.

237
0:11:14.889,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And Damon, who runs the local Circle, calls her back and says, "How can I help?"

238
0:11:18.713,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And Belinda says, "Oh no, I'm fine --

239
0:11:20.648,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Jocelyn is doing the shopping, Tony's doing the gardening,

240
0:11:23.465,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Melissa and Joe are going to come in and cook and chat."

241
0:11:26.186,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So five Circle members had organized themselves

242
0:11:29.217,000 --> 0:11:3,000
to take care of Belinda.

243
0:11:32.123,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And Belinda's 80, although she says that she feels 25 inside,

244
0:11:35.493,000 --> 0:11:36,000
but she also says

245
0:11:37.081,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that she felt stuck and pretty down when she joined Circle.

246
0:11:41.083,000 --> 0:11:45,000
But the simple act of encouraging her to come along to that first event

247
0:11:45.588,000 --> 0:11:48,000
led to a process where natural friendships formed,

248
0:11:48.812,000 --> 0:11:52,000
friendships that today are replacing the need for expensive services.

249
0:11:53.157,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It's relationships that are making the difference.

250
0:11:57.572,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So I think that three factors have converged

251
0:12:00.504,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that enable us to put relationships at the heart and center

252
0:12:03.52,000 --> 0:12:05,000
of how we solve social problems today.

253
0:12:06.389,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Firstly, the nature of the problems --

254
0:12:08.476,000 --> 0:12:1,000
they've changed, and they require different solutions.

255
0:12:11.155,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Secondly, the cost, human as much as financial, of doing business as usual.

256
0:12:15.669,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And thirdly, technology.

257
0:12:18.009,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I've talked about the first two factors.

258
0:12:20.553,000 --> 0:12:22,000
It's technology that enables these approaches to scale

259
0:12:23.525,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and potentially now support thousands of people.

260
0:12:26.911,000 --> 0:12:28,000
So the technology we've used is really simple,

261
0:12:29.094,000 --> 0:12:32,000
it's made up of available things like databases, mobile phones.

262
0:12:32.571,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Circle has got this very simple system that underpins it,

263
0:12:35.331,000 --> 0:12:38,000
enables a small local team to support a membership of up to a thousand.

264
0:12:39.215,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And you can contrast this with a neighborhood organization

265
0:12:42.012,000 --> 0:12:43,000
of the 1970s,

266
0:12:43.193,000 --> 0:12:45,000
when this kind of scale just wasn't possible,

267
0:12:45.38,000 --> 0:12:49,000
neither was the quality or the longevity that the spine of technology can provide.

268
0:12:49.52,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So it's relationships underpinned by technology

269
0:12:52.773,000 --> 0:12:54,000
that can turn the Beveridge models on their heads.

270
0:12:55.71,000 --> 0:12:58,000
The Beveridge models are all about institutions with finite resources,

271
0:12:59.38,000 --> 0:13:01,000
anonymously managing access.

272
0:13:01.845,000 --> 0:13:02,000
In my work at the front line,

273
0:13:03.489,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I've seen again and again how up to 80 percent of resource

274
0:13:07.199,000 --> 0:13:09,000
is spent keeping people out.

275
0:13:09.258,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So professionals have to administer

276
0:13:10.972,000 --> 0:13:12,000
these increasingly complex forms of administration

277
0:13:13.39,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that are basically about stopping people accessing the service

278
0:13:16.756,000 --> 0:13:17,000
or managing the queue.

279
0:13:18.93,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And Circle, like the relational services that we and others have designed,

280
0:13:23.29,000 --> 0:13:24,000
inverts this logic.

281
0:13:24.679,000 --> 0:13:27,000
What it says is, the more people, the more relationships,

282
0:13:28.696,000 --> 0:13:3,000
the stronger the solution.

283
0:13:31.734,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So I want to tell you my third and final story,

284
0:13:34.12,000 --> 0:13:35,000
which is about unemployment.

285
0:13:37.3,000 --> 0:13:39,000
In Britain, as in most places in the world,

286
0:13:40.09,000 --> 0:13:42,000
our welfare states were primarily designed

287
0:13:42.654,000 --> 0:13:44,000
to get people into work,

288
0:13:45.323,000 --> 0:13:46,000
to educate them for this,

289
0:13:47.339,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and to keep them healthy.

290
0:13:49.035,000 --> 0:13:51,000
But here, too, the systems are failing.

291
0:13:51.592,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And so the response has been

292
0:13:52.988,000 --> 0:13:55,000
to try and make these old systems even more efficient and transactional --

293
0:13:56.549,000 --> 0:13:59,000
to speed up processing times, divide people into ever-smaller categories,

294
0:14:00.205,000 --> 0:14:03,000
try and target services at them more efficiently -- in other words,

295
0:14:03.4,000 --> 0:14:05,000
the very opposite of relational.

296
0:14:07.425,000 --> 0:14:1,000
But guess how most people find work today?

297
0:14:11.583,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Through word of mouth.

298
0:14:13.399,000 --> 0:14:17,000
It turns out that in Britain today, most new jobs are not advertised.

299
0:14:18.024,000 --> 0:14:2,000
So it's friends that tell you about a job,

300
0:14:20.191,000 --> 0:14:22,000
it's friends that recommend you for a job,

301
0:14:22.488,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and it's a rich and diverse social network that helps you find work.

302
0:14:26.803,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Maybe some of you here this evening are thinking,

303
0:14:29.152,000 --> 0:14:3,000
"But I found my job through an advert,"

304
0:14:31.037,000 --> 0:14:34,000
but if you think back, it was probably a friend that showed you the ad

305
0:14:34.383,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and then encouraged you to apply.

306
0:14:35.984,000 --> 0:14:36,000
But not surprisingly,

307
0:14:37.331,000 --> 0:14:4,000
people who perhaps most need this rich and diverse network

308
0:14:40.634,000 --> 0:14:42,000
are those who are most isolated from it.

309
0:14:43.357,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So knowing this,

310
0:14:44.656,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and also knowing about the costs and failure of current systems,

311
0:14:47.702,000 --> 0:14:49,000
we designed something new with relationships at its heart.

312
0:14:50.675,000 --> 0:14:55,000
We designed a service that encourages people to meet up,

313
0:14:56.061,000 --> 0:14:57,000
people in and out of work,

314
0:14:57.525,000 --> 0:14:58,000
to work together in structured ways

315
0:14:59.3,000 --> 0:15:,000
and try new opportunities.

316
0:15:02.308,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And, well, it's very hard to compare the results of these new systems

317
0:15:06.303,000 --> 0:15:07,000
with the old transactional models,

318
0:15:07.999,000 --> 0:15:09,000
but it looks like, with our first 1,000 members,

319
0:15:10.324,000 --> 0:15:12,000
we outperformed existing services by a factor of three,

320
0:15:13.239,000 --> 0:15:14,000
at a fraction of the cost.

321
0:15:15.223,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And here, too, we've used technology,

322
0:15:18.127,000 --> 0:15:21,000
but not to network people in the way that a social platform would do.

323
0:15:21.549,000 --> 0:15:24,000
We've used it to bring people face to face and connect them with each other,

324
0:15:25.175,000 --> 0:15:28,000
building real relationships and supporting people to find work.

325
0:15:30.308,000 --> 0:15:32,000
At the end of his life, in 1948,

326
0:15:33.279,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Beveridge wrote a third report.

327
0:15:35.913,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And in it he said he had made a dreadful mistake.

328
0:15:40.356,000 --> 0:15:43,000
He had left people and their communities out.

329
0:15:45.111,000 --> 0:15:49,000
And this omission, he said, led to seeing people,

330
0:15:49.74,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and people starting to see themselves,

331
0:15:51.899,000 --> 0:15:54,000
within the categories of the bureaucracies and the institutions.

332
0:15:55.708,000 --> 0:15:57,000
And human relationships were already withering.

333
0:15:59.296,000 --> 0:16:02,000
But unfortunately, this third report was much less read

334
0:16:02.536,000 --> 0:16:03,000
than Beveridge's earlier work.

335
0:16:05.115,000 --> 0:16:09,000
But today, we need to bring people and their communities

336
0:16:09.35,000 --> 0:16:13,000
back into the heart of the way we design new systems and new services,

337
0:16:13.501,000 --> 0:16:15,000
in an approach that I call "Relational Welfare."

338
0:16:16.032,000 --> 0:16:18,000
We need to leave behind these old, transactional,

339
0:16:18.572,000 --> 0:16:2,000
unsuitable, outdated models,

340
0:16:20.854,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and we need to adopt instead the shared collective relational responses

341
0:16:24.389,000 --> 0:16:26,000
that can support a family like Ella's,

342
0:16:26.869,000 --> 0:16:28,000
that can address an issue like loneliness,

343
0:16:29.2,000 --> 0:16:31,000
that can support people into work and up the skills curve

344
0:16:31.959,000 --> 0:16:32,000
in a modern labor market,

345
0:16:33.427,000 --> 0:16:37,000
that can also address challenges of education, of health care systems,

346
0:16:37.589,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and so many more of those problems that are pressing on our societies.

347
0:16:42.306,000 --> 0:16:44,000
It is all about relationships.

348
0:16:45.324,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Relationships are the critical resource we have.

349
0:16:48.375,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Thank you.

350
0:16:49.55,000 --> 0:16:54,000

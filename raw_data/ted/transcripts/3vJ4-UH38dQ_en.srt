1
0:00:12.867,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Zika fever:

2
0:00:15.94,000 --> 0:00:18,000
our newest dread disease.

3
0:00:19.67,000 --> 0:00:21,000
What is it? Where'd it come from?

4
0:00:22.69,000 --> 0:00:23,000
What do we do about it?

5
0:00:24.85,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Well for most adults, it's a relatively mild disease --

6
0:00:28.144,000 --> 0:00:32,000
a little fever, a little headache, joint pain, maybe a rash.

7
0:00:32.83,000 --> 0:00:35,000
In fact, most people who get it don't even know they've had it.

8
0:00:36.64,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But the more we find out about the Zika virus

9
0:00:40.378,000 --> 0:00:41,000
the more terrifying it becomes.

10
0:00:41.95,000 --> 0:00:44,000
For example, doctors have noticed an uptick

11
0:00:45.481,000 --> 0:00:48,000
of something called Guillain-Barré syndrome in recent outbreaks.

12
0:00:49.219,000 --> 0:00:52,000
In Guillain-Barré, your immune system attacks your nerve cells

13
0:00:52.395,000 --> 0:00:55,000
it can partially or even totally paralyze you.

14
0:00:56.092,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Fortunately, that's quite rare, and most people recover.

15
0:01:00.04,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But if you're pregnant when you're infected

16
0:01:05.72,000 --> 0:01:07,000
you're at risk of something terrible.

17
0:01:08.524,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Indeed, a child with a deformed head.

18
0:01:12.5,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Here's a normal baby.

19
0:01:15.134,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Here's that infant with what's called microcephaly.

20
0:01:18.895,000 --> 0:01:2,000
a brain in a head that's too small.

21
0:01:22.213,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And there's no known cure.

22
0:01:24.941,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It was actually doctors in northeastern Brazil

23
0:01:30.695,000 --> 0:01:35,000
who first noticed, just a year ago, after a Zika outbreak,

24
0:01:35.829,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that there was a peak in the incidence of microcephaly.

25
0:01:40.583,000 --> 0:01:41,000
It took medical doctors another year

26
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to be sure that it was caused by the Zika virus,

27
0:01:45.146,000 --> 0:01:46,000
but they're now sure.

28
0:01:46.321,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And if you're a "bring on the evidence" type,

29
0:01:49.027,000 --> 0:01:5,000
check out this publication.

30
0:01:51.58,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So where did it come from, and how did it get here?

31
0:01:54.548,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And it is here.

32
0:01:55.881,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Like many of our viruses, it came out of Africa,

33
0:01:59.261,000 --> 0:02:02,000
specifically the Zika forest in Uganda.

34
0:02:03.596,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Researchers at the nearby Yellow Fever Research Institute

35
0:02:08.398,000 --> 0:02:12,000
identified an unknown virus in a monkey in the Zika forest

36
0:02:12.708,000 --> 0:02:14,000
which is how it got its name.

37
0:02:15.413,000 --> 0:02:17,000
The first human cases of Zika fever

38
0:02:17.65,000 --> 0:02:19,000
surfaced a few years later in Uganda-Tanzania.

39
0:02:21.299,000 --> 0:02:23,000
The virus then spread through West Africa

40
0:02:25.036,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and east through equatorial Asia -- Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia.

41
0:02:32.164,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But it was still mostly in monkeys and, of course, mosquitoes.

42
0:02:37.692,000 --> 0:02:42,000
In fact in the 60 years between the time it was first identified in 1947 and 2007

43
0:02:43.514,000 --> 0:02:46,000
there were only 13 reported cases of human Zika fever.

44
0:02:47.551,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And then something extraordinary happened on the tiny Micronesian Yap islands.

45
0:02:53.52,000 --> 0:02:58,000
There was an outbreak that affected fully 75 percent of the population.

46
0:02:59.686,000 --> 0:03:01,000
How did it get there? By air.

47
0:03:03.4,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Today we have two billion commercial airline passengers.

48
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
An infected passenger can board a plane, fly halfway around the world

49
0:03:11.427,000 --> 0:03:14,000
before developing symptoms -- if they develop symptoms at all.

50
0:03:15.96,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Then when they land, the local mosquitoes begin to bite them and spread the fever.

51
0:03:20.937,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Zika fever then next surfaced in 2013 in French Polynesia.

52
0:03:27.18,000 --> 0:03:32,000
By December of that year, it was being transmitted locally by the mosquitoes.

53
0:03:32.834,000 --> 0:03:37,000
That led to an explosive outbreak in which almost 30,000 people were affected.

54
0:03:38.191,000 --> 0:03:4,000
From there it radiated around the Pacific.

55
0:03:40.612,000 --> 0:03:44,000
There were outbreaks in the Cook Islands, in New Caledonia,

56
0:03:45.524,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in Vanuatu, in the Solomon Islands

57
0:03:47.968,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and almost all the way around to the coast of South America and Easter Island.

58
0:03:52.88,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And then, in early 2015,

59
0:03:56.356,000 --> 0:04:,000
there was an upsurge of cases of a dengue-like syndrome

60
0:04:01.213,000 --> 0:04:04,000
in the city of Natal in northeastern Brazil.

61
0:04:05.141,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The virus wasn't dengue, it was Zika, and it spread rapidly --

62
0:04:11.267,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Recife down the coast, a big metropolitan center, soon became the epicenter.

63
0:04:17.235,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Well people have speculated that it was 2014 World Cup soccer fans

64
0:04:22.861,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that brought the virus into the country.

65
0:04:25.66,000 --> 0:04:29,000
But others have speculated that perhaps it was Pacific Islanders

66
0:04:29.755,000 --> 0:04:31,000
participating in championship canoe races

67
0:04:32.438,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that were held in Rio that year that brought it in.

68
0:04:35.65,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Well today, this is only a year later.

69
0:04:39.583,000 --> 0:04:42,000
The virus is being locally transmitted by mosquitoes

70
0:04:43.024,000 --> 0:04:46,000
virtually throughout South America, Central America, Mexico

71
0:04:46.309,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and the Caribbean Islands

72
0:04:48.5,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Until this year, the many thousands of cases

73
0:04:51.911,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that have been diagnosed in the US were contracted elsewhere.

74
0:04:56.896,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But as of this summer, it's being transmitted locally in Miami.

75
0:05:02.078,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It's here.

76
0:05:03.343,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So what do we do about it?

77
0:05:04.99,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Well, preventing infection

78
0:05:09.855,000 --> 0:05:12,000
is either about protecting people or about eliminating the mosquitoes.

79
0:05:14.08,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Let's focus on people first.

80
0:05:16.51,000 --> 0:05:17,000
You can get vaccinated.

81
0:05:18.892,000 --> 0:05:21,000
You can not travel to Zika areas.

82
0:05:22.889,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Or you can cover up and apply insect repellent.

83
0:05:26.658,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Getting vaccinated is not an option, because there isn't a vaccine yet

84
0:05:30.087,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and there probably won't be for a couple of years.

85
0:05:33.673,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Staying home isn't a foolproof protection either

86
0:05:37.64,000 --> 0:05:4,000
because we now know that it can be sexually transmitted.

87
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Covering up and applying insect repellent does work ...

88
0:05:45.476,000 --> 0:05:46,000
until you forget.

89
0:05:47.642,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Laughter)

90
0:05:49.444,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So that leaves the mosquitoes, and here's how we control them now:

91
0:05:53.055,000 --> 0:05:54,000
spraying insecticides.

92
0:05:56.134,000 --> 0:05:59,000
The protective gear is necessary because these are toxic chemicals

93
0:06:00.024,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that kill people as well as bugs.

94
0:06:02.649,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Although it does take quite a lot more to kill a person than to kill a bug.

95
0:06:06.44,000 --> 0:06:1,000
These are pictures from Brazil and Nicaragua.

96
0:06:10.64,000 --> 0:06:12,000
But it looks the same in Miami, Florida.

97
0:06:13.59,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And we of course can spray insecticides from planes.

98
0:06:19.28,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Last summer, mosquito control officials in Dorchester County, South Carolina,

99
0:06:25.518,000 --> 0:06:28,000
authorized spraying of Naled, an insecticide,

100
0:06:29.447,000 --> 0:06:31,000
early one morning, as recommended by the manufacturer.

101
0:06:32.81,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Later that day, a beekeeper told reporters

102
0:06:37.049,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that her bee yard looked like it had been nuked.

103
0:06:41.644,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Oops.

104
0:06:43.699,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Bees are the good guys.

105
0:06:45.46,000 --> 0:06:52,000
The citizens of Florida protested, but spraying continued.

106
0:06:53.071,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Unfortunately, so did the increase in the number of Zika fever cases.

107
0:06:58.02,000 --> 0:07:01,000
That's because insecticides aren't very effective.

108
0:07:02.21,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So are there any approaches that are perhaps more effective than spraying

109
0:07:10.38,000 --> 0:07:15,000
but with less downsides than toxic chemicals?

110
0:07:16.15,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I'm a huge fan of biological controls,

111
0:07:19.665,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and I share that view with Rachel Carson, author of "Silent Spring,"

112
0:07:24.182,000 --> 0:07:29,000
the book that is credited with starting the environmental movement.

113
0:07:29.22,000 --> 0:07:32,000
In this book she tells the story, as an example,

114
0:07:32.8,000 --> 0:07:37,000
of how a very nasty insect pest of livestock

115
0:07:38.482,000 --> 0:07:41,000
was eliminated in the last century.

116
0:07:41.97,000 --> 0:07:43,000
No one knows that extraordinary story today.

117
0:07:44.446,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So Jack Block and I, when we were writing an editorial

118
0:07:48.709,000 --> 0:07:51,000
about the mosquito problem today, retold that story.

119
0:07:51.947,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And in capsule form, it's that pupae -- that's the immature form of the insect --

120
0:07:56.637,000 --> 0:08:,000
were irradiated until they were sterile, grown to adulthood

121
0:08:01.44,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and then released from planes all over the Southwest,

122
0:08:05.074,000 --> 0:08:09,000
the Southeast and down into Mexico and into Central America

123
0:08:09.511,000 --> 0:08:12,000
literally by the hundreds of millions from little airplanes,

124
0:08:13.629,000 --> 0:08:17,000
eventually eliminating that terrible insect pest

125
0:08:18.502,000 --> 0:08:2,000
for most of the Western Hemisphere.

126
0:08:21.995,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Our real purpose in writing this editorial

127
0:08:24.423,000 --> 0:08:26,000
was to introduce readers to how we can do that today --

128
0:08:27.819,000 --> 0:08:31,000
not with radiation but with our knowledge of genetics.

129
0:08:31.898,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Let me explain.

130
0:08:33.73,000 --> 0:08:35,000
This is the bad guy: Aedes aegypti.

131
0:08:36.23,000 --> 0:08:4,000
It's the most common insect vector of diseases,

132
0:08:40.915,000 --> 0:08:43,000
not just Zika but dengue, Chikungunya, West Nile virus

133
0:08:44.733,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and that ancient plague, yellow fever.

134
0:08:48.79,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It's an urban mosquito,

135
0:08:50.679,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and it's the female that does the dirty work.

136
0:08:54.609,000 --> 0:08:58,000
She bites to get a blood meal to feed her offspring.

137
0:09:00.07,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Males don't bite; they don't even have the mouth parts to bite.

138
0:09:04.419,000 --> 0:09:1,000
A little British company called Oxitec genetically modified that mosquito

139
0:09:10.601,000 --> 0:09:16,000
so that when it mates with a wild female, its eggs don't develop to adulthood.

140
0:09:16.97,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Let me show you.

141
0:09:18.477,000 --> 0:09:2,000
This is the normal reproductive cycle.

142
0:09:21.715,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Oxitec designed the mosquito so that when the male mates with the wild female

143
0:09:26.897,000 --> 0:09:27,000
the eggs don't develop.

144
0:09:28.6,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Sounds impossible?

145
0:09:30.56,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Well let me show you just diagrammatically how they do it.

146
0:09:34.36,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Now this represents the nucleus of a mosquito cell,

147
0:09:37.836,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and that tangle in the middle represents its genome,

148
0:09:40.812,000 --> 0:09:42,000
the sum total of its genes.

149
0:09:43.336,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Scientists added a single gene

150
0:09:46.709,000 --> 0:09:5,000
that codes for a protein represented by this orange ball

151
0:09:51.042,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that feeds back on itself to keep cranking out more of that protein.

152
0:09:57.06,000 --> 0:10:01,000
The extra copies, however, go and gum up the mosquitoes' genes,

153
0:10:01.837,000 --> 0:10:02,000
killing the organism.

154
0:10:04.06,000 --> 0:10:07,000
To keep it alive in the laboratory they use a compound called tetracycline.

155
0:10:08.456,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Tetracycline shuts off that gene and allows normal development.

156
0:10:13.844,000 --> 0:10:17,000
They added another little wrinkle so that they could study what happens.

157
0:10:18.201,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And that is they added a gene that makes the insect glow under UV light

158
0:10:25.456,000 --> 0:10:28,000
so that when they released it they could follow exactly how far it went

159
0:10:28.822,000 --> 0:10:31,000
how long it lived and all of the kinds of data

160
0:10:32.6,000 --> 0:10:33,000
for a good scientific study.

161
0:10:34.97,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Now this is the pupal stage, and at this stage

162
0:10:39.106,000 --> 0:10:41,000
the females are larger than the males.

163
0:10:42.42,000 --> 0:10:45,000
That allows them to sort them into the males and the females

164
0:10:46.312,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and they allow only the males to grow to adulthood.

165
0:10:51.058,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And let me remind you that males don't bite.

166
0:10:53.4,000 --> 0:10:54,000
From there it's pretty simple.

167
0:10:55.02,000 --> 0:10:58,000
They take beakers full of male mosquitoes,

168
0:10:58.646,000 --> 0:11:,000
load them into milk cartons, and drive around the city,

169
0:11:01.25,000 --> 0:11:03,000
releasing them guided by GPS.

170
0:11:04.678,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Here's the mayor of a city releasing the first batch

171
0:11:07.219,000 --> 0:11:09,000
of what they call the "friendly Aedes."

172
0:11:10.23,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Now I wish I could tell you this is an American city, but it's not.

173
0:11:13.515,000 --> 0:11:14,000
It's Piracicaba, Brazil.

174
0:11:15.991,000 --> 0:11:19,000
The amazing thing is that in just a year

175
0:11:20.808,000 --> 0:11:25,000
it brought down the cases of dengue by 91 percent.

176
0:11:26.31,000 --> 0:11:29,000
That's better than any insecticide spraying can do.

177
0:11:30.24,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So why aren't we using this remarkable biological control in the US?

178
0:11:35.77,000 --> 0:11:41,000
That's because it's a GMO: a genetically modified organism.

179
0:11:42.72,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Notice the subtitle here says if the FDA would let them

180
0:11:47.664,000 --> 0:11:49,000
they could do the same thing here, when Zika arrives.

181
0:11:50.39,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And of course it has arrived.

182
0:11:52.428,000 --> 0:11:55,000
So now I have to tell you the short form

183
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
of the long, torturous story of GM regulation in the US

184
0:12:02.747,000 --> 0:12:08,000
In the US, there are three agencies that regulate genetically modified organisms:

185
0:12:09.985,000 --> 0:12:11,000
the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration,

186
0:12:12.5,000 --> 0:12:14,000
the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency,

187
0:12:14.746,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and the USDA, US Department of Agriculture.

188
0:12:18.34,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Took these folks two years to decide that it would be the FDA

189
0:12:23.157,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that would regulate the genetically modified mosquito.

190
0:12:26.084,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And they would do it as a new animal drug, if that makes any sense.

191
0:12:33.13,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Took them another five years going back and forth and back and forth

192
0:12:36.685,000 --> 0:12:41,000
to convince the FDA that this would not harm people,

193
0:12:42.096,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and it would not harm the environment.

194
0:12:45.1,000 --> 0:12:5,000
They finally gave them, this summer, permission to run a little test

195
0:12:50.451,000 --> 0:12:51,000
in the Florida Keys,

196
0:12:52.014,000 --> 0:12:58,000
where they had been invited years earlier when they Keys had an outbreak of dengue.

197
0:12:59.604,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Would that it were that easy.

198
0:13:02.17,000 --> 0:13:04,000
When the local residents heard

199
0:13:04.4,000 --> 0:13:08,000
that there would be genetically modified mosquitoes tested in their community

200
0:13:08.519,000 --> 0:13:1,000
some of them began to organize protests.

201
0:13:11.368,000 --> 0:13:16,000
They even organized a petition on the internet with this cuddly logo,

202
0:13:16.963,000 --> 0:13:22,000
which eventually accumulated some 160,000 signatures

203
0:13:23.224,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And they demanded a referendum

204
0:13:24.93,000 --> 0:13:26,000
which will be conducted in just a couple of weeks

205
0:13:27.826,000 --> 0:13:3,000
about whether the trials would be permitted at all.

206
0:13:32.135,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Well it's Miami that really needs these better ways of controlling insects.

207
0:13:38.556,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And there the attitudes are changing.

208
0:13:40.721,000 --> 0:13:46,000
In fact, very recently a bipartisan group of more than 60 legislators

209
0:13:46.76,000 --> 0:13:49,000
wrote to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell

210
0:13:49.966,000 --> 0:13:54,000
asking that she, at the Federal level, expedite access for Florida

211
0:13:55.334,000 --> 0:13:57,000
to this new technology.

212
0:13:58.02,000 --> 0:13:59,000
So the bottom line is this:

213
0:13:59.631,000 --> 0:14:02,000
biological control of harmful insects

214
0:14:03.583,000 --> 0:14:07,000
can be both more effective and very much more environmentally friendly

215
0:14:08.519,000 --> 0:14:12,000
than using insecticides, which are toxic chemicals.

216
0:14:13.336,000 --> 0:14:16,000
That was true in Rachel Carson's time; it's true today.

217
0:14:16.8,000 --> 0:14:21,000
What's different is that we have enormously more information

218
0:14:22.538,000 --> 0:14:23,000
about genetics than we had then,

219
0:14:24.459,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and therefore more ability to use that information

220
0:14:28.999,000 --> 0:14:3,000
to affect these biological controls.

221
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And I hope that what I've done is aroused your curiosity enough

222
0:14:37.212,000 --> 0:14:42,000
to start your own inquiry -- not into just GM mosquitoes

223
0:14:42.52,000 --> 0:14:48,000
but to the other genetically modified organisms that are so controversial today.

224
0:14:49.567,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I think if you do that, and you dig down through all of the misinformation,

225
0:14:54.288,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and the marketing

226
0:14:55.622,000 --> 0:14:58,000
on the part of the organic food industry and the Greenpeaces

227
0:14:59.034,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and find the science, the accurate science,

228
0:15:02.208,000 --> 0:15:04,000
you'll be surprised and pleased.

229
0:15:04.94,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Thank you.

230
0:15:06.114,000 --> 0:15:08,000
(Applause)

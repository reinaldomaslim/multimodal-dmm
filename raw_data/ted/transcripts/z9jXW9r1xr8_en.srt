2
0:00:12.706,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So if you live on planet Earth

3
0:00:15.208,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and you're one of seven billion people that eats food every day,

4
0:00:18.792,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I need you to pay attention,

5
0:00:20.208,000 --> 0:00:22,000
because over the next three decades,

6
0:00:22.375,000 --> 0:00:23,000
we will need to address

7
0:00:23.833,000 --> 0:00:26,000
one of the most critical global challenges of our generation.

8
0:00:27.833,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And I'm not talking about climate change.

9
0:00:30.083,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I'm talking about food and agriculture.

10
0:00:33.625,000 --> 0:00:38,000
In 2050, our global population is projected to reach 9.8 billion,

11
0:00:38.75,000 --> 0:00:41,000
with 68 percent of us living in urban city centers.

12
0:00:42.667,000 --> 0:00:44,000
In order to feed this massive population,

13
0:00:45.542,000 --> 0:00:47,000
we will need to increase our agricultural output

14
0:00:47.958,000 --> 0:00:49,000
by 70 percent over current levels.

15
0:00:51.083,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Just to put this number into perspective,

16
0:00:53.125,000 --> 0:00:56,000
we will need to grow more food in the next 35 to 40 years

17
0:00:56.542,000 --> 0:00:59,000
than the previous 10,000 years combined.

18
0:01:00.333,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Put simply, not only is our global population becoming bigger,

19
0:01:04.333,000 --> 0:01:05,000
but it's also getting denser,

20
0:01:06.25,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and we will need to grow significantly more food

21
0:01:08.875,000 --> 0:01:1,000
using significantly less land and resources.

22
0:01:13.042,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Complicating our current efforts to address these major demographic shifts

23
0:01:18.625,000 --> 0:01:21,000
are the challenges facing the agricultural industry today.

24
0:01:22.917,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Globally, one third of all the food that we produce is wasted,

25
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:3,000
acquitting to 1.6 billion tons of food

26
0:01:30.333,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that spoiled on the way to the market

27
0:01:32.708,000 --> 0:01:34,000
or expired in our refrigerators

28
0:01:35.125,000 --> 0:01:37,000
or were simply thrown out by supermarkets and restaurants

29
0:01:37.875,000 --> 0:01:38,000
at the end of the day.

30
0:01:39.583,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Every single year, up to 600 million people

31
0:01:42.75,000 --> 0:01:44,000
will get sick eating contaminated food,

32
0:01:45.208,000 --> 0:01:49,000
highlighting the challenge that we have of maintaining global food safety.

33
0:01:49.292,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And, maybe unsurprisingly,

34
0:01:51.375,000 --> 0:01:52,000
the agricultural industry

35
0:01:53.042,000 --> 0:01:55,000
is the single largest consumer of fresh water,

36
0:01:55.833,000 --> 0:01:57,000
accounting for 70 percent of global usage.

37
0:01:59.875,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Now, you'll be relieved to know

38
0:02:02.042,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that the agricultural industry

39
0:02:04.375,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and that the global movement by universities, companies and NGOs

40
0:02:09.625,000 --> 0:02:11,000
is putting together comprehensive research

41
0:02:11.667,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and developing novel technology

42
0:02:13.583,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to address all of these issues.

43
0:02:16.125,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And many have been doing it for decades.

44
0:02:18.542,000 --> 0:02:21,000
But one of the more recent innovations in food production

45
0:02:22.167,000 --> 0:02:25,000
being deployed in industrial parks in North America,

46
0:02:25.75,000 --> 0:02:27,000
in the urban city centers of Asia,

47
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and even in the arid deserts of the Middle East

48
0:02:30.417,000 --> 0:02:31,000
is controlled environment agriculture.

49
0:02:33.375,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Controlled environment agriculture is actually just a fancy way of saying

50
0:02:36.958,000 --> 0:02:37,000
weather- or climate-proof farming,

51
0:02:38.958,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and many of these farms grow food three-dimensionally in vertical racks,

52
0:02:42.833,000 --> 0:02:45,000
as opposed to the two dimensions of conventional farms.

53
0:02:46.208,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And so this type of food production is also referred to

54
0:02:49.167,000 --> 0:02:5,000
as indoor vertical farming.

55
0:02:52.167,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I've been involved in the indoor vertical farming space

56
0:02:54.833,000 --> 0:02:55,000
for the past five and a half years,

57
0:02:56.583,000 --> 0:02:58,000
developing technology to make this type of food production

58
0:02:59.375,000 --> 0:03:01,000
more efficient and affordable.

59
0:03:01.5,000 --> 0:03:04,000
This picture was taken outside of a decommissioned shipping container

60
0:03:05.083,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that we converted into an indoor farm

61
0:03:07.917,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and then launched into the heart and the heat of Dubai.

62
0:03:12.458,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Indoor vertical farming is a relatively recent phenomena,

63
0:03:15.667,000 --> 0:03:16,000
commercially speaking,

64
0:03:16.958,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and the reason for this is that consumers care more about food safety

65
0:03:20.292,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and where their food comes from,

66
0:03:21.917,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and also, the necessary technology to make this possible

67
0:03:25.667,000 --> 0:03:28,000
is more readily available and lower cost,

68
0:03:28.75,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and the overall cost of food production globally is actually increasing,

69
0:03:33.417,000 --> 0:03:35,000
making this type of food production more competitive.

70
0:03:35.958,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So if you want to build an indoor vertical farm,

71
0:03:39.042,000 --> 0:03:42,000
you will need to replace some of the conventional elements of farming

72
0:03:42.542,000 --> 0:03:43,000
with artificial substitutes,

73
0:03:44.333,000 --> 0:03:45,000
starting with sunlight.

74
0:03:47.208,000 --> 0:03:48,000
In indoor vertical farms,

75
0:03:48.875,000 --> 0:03:51,000
natural sunlight is replaced with artificial lighting like LEDs.

76
0:03:52.5,000 --> 0:03:55,000
While there are many different types of LEDs being used,

77
0:03:55.625,000 --> 0:03:57,000
the one that we decided to install here

78
0:03:57.667,000 --> 0:03:59,000
is called "full spectrum LEDs,"

79
0:03:59.875,000 --> 0:04:02,000
which was optimized for the type of vegetables that we were growing.

80
0:04:03.5,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Also, in order to maximize production for a given space,

81
0:04:07.333,000 --> 0:04:11,000
indoor vertical farms also utilize and install racking systems

82
0:04:11.458,000 --> 0:04:12,000
to grow vegetables vertically,

83
0:04:13.375,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and some of the biggest facilities

84
0:04:15.125,000 --> 0:04:17,000
stack their production 14 to 16 floors high.

85
0:04:19.625,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Now most of these farms are hydroponic or aeroponic systems,

86
0:04:22.833,000 --> 0:04:23,000
which means that instead of using soil,

87
0:04:24.792,000 --> 0:04:27,000
they use a substitute material like polyurethane sponges,

88
0:04:28.375,000 --> 0:04:29,000
biodegradable peat moss

89
0:04:30.208,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and even use inorganic materials like perlite and clay pellets.

90
0:04:35.125,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Another unique aspects about these farms

91
0:04:37.125,000 --> 0:04:39,000
is that they use a precise nutrient formula

92
0:04:39.625,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that is circulated and recycled throughout the facility,

93
0:04:42.917,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and this is pumped directly to the vegetables' root zone

94
0:04:45.625,000 --> 0:04:46,000
to promote plant growth.

95
0:04:47.917,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And lastly, these farms use

96
0:04:49.917,000 --> 0:04:51,000
a sophisticated monitoring and automation system

97
0:04:52.667,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to significantly increase productivity,

98
0:04:55.125,000 --> 0:04:57,000
efficiency and consistency,

99
0:04:57.458,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and these tools also provide the added benefit

100
0:04:59.958,000 --> 0:05:02,000
of producing food that is more traceable and safe.

101
0:05:04.625,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Some of the obvious benefits of growing food in this way

102
0:05:08.25,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is that you have year-round vegetable production,

103
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:14,000
you have consistent quality and you have predictable output.

104
0:05:14.583,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Some of the other major benefits

105
0:05:16.542,000 --> 0:05:19,000
include significant resource use efficiencies,

106
0:05:20.083,000 --> 0:05:21,000
particularly water.

107
0:05:22.667,000 --> 0:05:24,000
For every kilogram of vegetables grown in this way,

108
0:05:25.417,000 --> 0:05:29,000
hundreds of liters of water is conserved compared to conventional farming methods.

109
0:05:30.083,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And with the water savings

110
0:05:31.417,000 --> 0:05:33,000
come similar savings in the use of fertilizer.

111
0:05:34.083,000 --> 0:05:35,000
One of the highest-yielding farms

112
0:05:35.917,000 --> 0:05:4,000
grows over 350 times more food per square meter than a conventional farm.

113
0:05:42.542,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And weatherproofing

114
0:05:43.958,000 --> 0:05:46,000
means complete control of incoming contaminants and pests,

115
0:05:47.833,000 --> 0:05:5,000
completely eliminating the need for the use of chemical pesticides.

116
0:05:52.333,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And not to be mistaken,

117
0:05:53.833,000 --> 0:05:56,000
these farms can produce enormous amounts of food,

118
0:05:56.875,000 --> 0:05:57,000
with one of the biggest facilities

119
0:05:58.583,000 --> 0:06:01,000
producing 30,000 heads of vegetables a day.

120
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:05,000
However, as with any new technology or innovation,

121
0:06:05.125,000 --> 0:06:06,000
there are some drawbacks.

122
0:06:06.542,000 --> 0:06:07,000
As you would imagine,

123
0:06:07.833,000 --> 0:06:1,000
growing food in this way can be incredibly energy-intensive.

124
0:06:11.083,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Also, these farms can only produce a small variety of vegetables commercially

125
0:06:15.083,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and the overall cost of the production still is quite high.

126
0:06:19.125,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And in order to address these issues,

127
0:06:21.292,000 --> 0:06:23,000
some of the biggest and most sophisticated farms

128
0:06:24.292,000 --> 0:06:27,000
are making significant investments, starting with energy efficiency.

129
0:06:29.458,000 --> 0:06:31,000
In order to reduce the high energy usage,

130
0:06:32.417,000 --> 0:06:35,000
there are efforts to develop higher-efficiency LEDs,

131
0:06:35.625,000 --> 0:06:37,000
to develop lasers optimized for plant growth

132
0:06:38.5,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and using even fiber-optic cables like these

133
0:06:41.667,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to channel sunlight directly into an indoor vertical farm

134
0:06:45.167,000 --> 0:06:47,000
during the day to reduce the need for artificial lighting.

135
0:06:49.208,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Also, to reduce the labor costs associated with hiring a more sophisticated,

136
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:57,000
more urban and also more high-skilled labor force,

137
0:06:57.375,000 --> 0:07:,000
robotics in automation is used extensively in large-scale facilities.

138
0:07:02.583,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And you can never really be too resource-efficient.

139
0:07:06.042,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Building indoor vertical farms in and around urban city centers

140
0:07:10.25,000 --> 0:07:12,000
can help to shorten the agricultural supply chain

141
0:07:13.125,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and also help to maintain the nutritional content in vegetables.

142
0:07:16.5,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Also, there are food deserts in many countries

143
0:07:20.333,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that have little to no access to nutritious vegetables,

144
0:07:24.125,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and as this industry matures,

145
0:07:25.875,000 --> 0:07:28,000
it will become possible to provide more equitable access

146
0:07:29.5,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to high-quality, highly nutritious vegetables

147
0:07:32.458,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in even the most underprivileged of communities.

148
0:07:35.75,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And finally, and this is really exciting for me personally,

149
0:07:39.667,000 --> 0:07:42,000
indoor vertical farming can actually be integrated seamlessly

150
0:07:43.375,000 --> 0:07:44,000
into the cityscape

151
0:07:44.792,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to help repurpose idle, underutilized and unused urban infrastructure.

152
0:07:51.375,000 --> 0:07:53,000
In fact, this is already happening today.

153
0:07:54.125,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Ride-sharing services have taken hundreds of thousands of cars off the road

154
0:07:58.833,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and they have significantly reduced the need for parking.

155
0:08:02.833,000 --> 0:08:04,000
This is a farm that we installed in central Beijing

156
0:08:05.375,000 --> 0:08:07,000
in an underutilized underground parking structure

157
0:08:08.375,000 --> 0:08:1,000
to grow vegetables for the nearby hotels.

158
0:08:11.458,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Underutilized infrastructure

159
0:08:12.875,000 --> 0:08:15,000
is not simply limited to large-scale civil engineering projects,

160
0:08:16.583,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and they can also include smaller spaces like idle restaurant corners.

161
0:08:21.167,000 --> 0:08:23,000
This is an example of a farm that we installed

162
0:08:23.417,000 --> 0:08:26,000
directly into the partition of a hotel entrance

163
0:08:26.625,000 --> 0:08:29,000
in order to grow fresh herbs and microgreens on-site for the chefs.

164
0:08:31.583,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Honestly, if you look around,

165
0:08:33.375,000 --> 0:08:35,000
you will find underutilized space everywhere,

166
0:08:36.167,000 --> 0:08:39,000
under, around and inside of urban developments.

167
0:08:40.542,000 --> 0:08:42,000
This is a farm that we installed into an empty office corner

168
0:08:43.458,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to grow fresh vegetables for the employees in nearby cafes.

169
0:08:48.167,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I get to be a part of all these cool projects

170
0:08:51.125,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and working in the agricultural industry

171
0:08:53.292,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to improve access and affordability

172
0:08:56.5,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to fresh and nutritious produce,

173
0:08:58.333,000 --> 0:09:,000
hopefully soon by anyone anywhere,

174
0:09:00.708,000 --> 0:09:03,000
has been the greatest joy and also the most humbling

175
0:09:04.083,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and intellectually challenging thing I've ever done.

176
0:09:07.792,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And now that I've convinced you that agriculture can be quite sexy,

177
0:09:11.875,000 --> 0:09:13,000
you'll be surprised and shocked to know

178
0:09:14.458,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that I still have trouble

179
0:09:16.708,000 --> 0:09:2,000
fully articulating how and why I decided to work, and continue to work,

180
0:09:21.667,000 --> 0:09:22,000
in the agricultural industry.

181
0:09:23.667,000 --> 0:09:26,000
But a couple of years ago, I found a rather unique answer

182
0:09:27.125,000 --> 0:09:29,000
hiding in plain sight.

183
0:09:29.167,000 --> 0:09:31,000
You see, I read an article

184
0:09:31.333,000 --> 0:09:33,000
about how your name,

185
0:09:33.375,000 --> 0:09:35,000
particularly your last name,

186
0:09:35.458,000 --> 0:09:36,000
can have a strong influence

187
0:09:36.792,000 --> 0:09:39,000
on everything from your personality to your professional career.

188
0:09:40.667,000 --> 0:09:42,000
This is my Japanese last name:

189
0:09:43.083,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Oda.

190
0:09:44.833,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And the characters translate literally

191
0:09:48.667,000 --> 0:09:49,000
into "small farm."

192
0:09:49.958,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Laughter)

193
0:09:51.25,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Thank you.

194
0:09:52.542,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Applause)

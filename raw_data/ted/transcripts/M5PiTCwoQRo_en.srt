1
0:00:13.37,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I grew up in a family of social scientists,

2
0:00:17.004,000 --> 0:00:19,000
but I was the weird child who drew.

3
0:00:20.108,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:21.796,000 --> 0:00:24,000
From making sketches of the models in my mom's Sears catalog ...

5
0:00:27.187,000 --> 0:00:29,000
to a bedroom so full of my craft projects

6
0:00:29.987,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that it was like my own personal art gallery,

7
0:00:33.164,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I lived to make.

8
0:00:36.909,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I don't think anyone in my family was surprised when I became an architect.

9
0:00:41.844,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But to be honest with you,

10
0:00:44.153,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the real foundation of the architect I became

11
0:00:46.631,000 --> 0:00:48,000
was not laid in that bedroom art gallery

12
0:00:49.307,000 --> 0:00:52,000
but by the conversations around my family's dinner table.

13
0:00:53.54,000 --> 0:00:57,000
There were stories of how people lived and connected to one another,

14
0:00:57.951,000 --> 0:01:,000
from the impact of urban migration on a village in Zambia

15
0:01:01.668,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to the complex health care needs

16
0:01:03.22,000 --> 0:01:05,000
of the homeless in the streets of San Francisco.

17
0:01:06.574,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now, it would be fair

18
0:01:07.788,000 --> 0:01:08,000
if you're looking over at your seatmate

19
0:01:09.759,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and wondering, "What the hell does that have to do with architecture?"

20
0:01:13.733,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Well, all of these stories involved space

21
0:01:18.497,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and how it did or didn't accommodate us.

22
0:01:23.134,000 --> 0:01:24,000
The fact is,

23
0:01:24.309,000 --> 0:01:25,000
we share some of our deepest connections

24
0:01:26.259,000 --> 0:01:27,000
in physical space.

25
0:01:28.309,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And our stories play out,

26
0:01:29.736,000 --> 0:01:32,000
even in this crazy age of texting and tweeting,

27
0:01:33.467,000 --> 0:01:34,000
in physical space.

28
0:01:36.201,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Unfortunately, architecture hasn't done a great job

29
0:01:40.058,000 --> 0:01:42,000
of telling all of our stories equally.

30
0:01:43.491,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Too often, we see the building of monuments like the Gherkin

31
0:01:47.311,000 --> 0:01:48,000
or even Trump Tower ...

32
0:01:48.716,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:50.749,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that tell the story of the haves rather than the have-nots.

34
0:01:55.245,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Throughout my career,

35
0:01:57.037,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I've actively resisted the practice

36
0:01:58.732,000 --> 0:02:,000
of building monuments to certain peoples' stories --

37
0:02:01.681,000 --> 0:02:04,000
usually white, male, rich --

38
0:02:05.047,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and bulldozing other peoples' stories --

39
0:02:07.536,000 --> 0:02:08,000
usually people of color

40
0:02:09.259,000 --> 0:02:1,000
from low-income communities.

41
0:02:11.857,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I've tried to create a practice

42
0:02:13.358,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that is rooted in elevating the stories

43
0:02:15.4,000 --> 0:02:17,000
of those who have most often been silenced.

44
0:02:19.491,000 --> 0:02:2,000
That work --

45
0:02:21.453,000 --> 0:02:23,000
it's been a mission in spatial justice.

46
0:02:24.487,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Applause)

47
0:02:30.482,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Now, spatial justice means that we understand

48
0:02:32.918,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that justice has a geography,

49
0:02:36.977,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and that the equitable distribution of resources, services and access

50
0:02:42.614,000 --> 0:02:43,000
is a basic human right.

51
0:02:45.426,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So what does spatial justice look like?

52
0:02:48.161,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Well, I'd like to share a story with you.

53
0:02:51.703,000 --> 0:02:52,000
For years,

54
0:02:53.031,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I've been working in the historically African-American neighborhood

55
0:02:56.212,000 --> 0:02:58,000
of Bayview Hunters Point in San Francisco,

56
0:02:58.32,000 --> 0:03:,000
on a plot of land that once held a power plant.

57
0:03:01.418,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Back in the '90s,

58
0:03:02.669,000 --> 0:03:05,000
a community group led by mothers who lived in the public housing

59
0:03:05.763,000 --> 0:03:06,000
on the hill above the plant

60
0:03:07.339,000 --> 0:03:08,000
fought for its closure.

61
0:03:09.111,000 --> 0:03:1,000
They won.

62
0:03:10.592,000 --> 0:03:12,000
The utility company finally tore it down,

63
0:03:13.359,000 --> 0:03:14,000
cleaned the soil

64
0:03:14.731,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and capped most of the site with asphalt

65
0:03:16.876,000 --> 0:03:18,000
so that the clean soil wouldn't blow away.

66
0:03:19.139,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Sounds like a success story, right?

67
0:03:22.231,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Well, not so fast.

68
0:03:24.342,000 --> 0:03:26,000
You see, because of various issues like land entitlements,

69
0:03:27.151,000 --> 0:03:29,000
lease agreements, etc.,

70
0:03:29.204,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the land actually couldn't be redeveloped for at least five to 10 years.

71
0:03:34.337,000 --> 0:03:37,000
What that meant is that this community

72
0:03:37.531,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that had been living near a power plant for decades,

73
0:03:40.817,000 --> 0:03:45,000
now had 30 acres of asphalt in their backyard.

74
0:03:47.711,000 --> 0:03:48,000
To put that in context for you,

75
0:03:49.275,000 --> 0:03:51,000
30 acres is equal to about 30 football fields.

76
0:03:52.909,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Now, the utility company didn't want to be the bad guy here.

77
0:03:56.147,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Recognizing that they owed the community,

78
0:03:58.439,000 --> 0:04:,000
they actually put out a call for designers

79
0:04:00.463,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to propose temporary uses for this site,

80
0:04:02.392,000 --> 0:04:04,000
hoping to turn it into a community benefit

81
0:04:05.291,000 --> 0:04:06,000
rather than blight.

82
0:04:07.351,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I'm part of the diverse team of designers that responded to that call,

83
0:04:11.164,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and for the last four years,

84
0:04:12.525,000 --> 0:04:14,000
we've been collaborating with those mothers

85
0:04:14.549,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and other residents,

86
0:04:15.724,000 --> 0:04:17,000
as well as local organizations and the utility company.

87
0:04:19.394,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We've been experimenting with all types of events

88
0:04:22.214,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to try and address issues of spatial justice.

89
0:04:24.754,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Everything from job training workshops

90
0:04:27.907,000 --> 0:04:28,000
to an annual circus

91
0:04:29.659,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to even a beautiful, new shoreline trail.

92
0:04:32.511,000 --> 0:04:34,000
In the four years that we've been operational,

93
0:04:35.003,000 --> 0:04:38,000
over 12,000 people have come and done something on this site

94
0:04:38.988,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that we hope has transformed their relationship to it.

95
0:04:44.115,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But lately,

96
0:04:45.652,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I'm starting to realize that events are not enough.

97
0:04:50.538,000 --> 0:04:51,000
A few months ago,

98
0:04:51.712,000 --> 0:04:53,000
there was a community meeting in this neighborhood.

99
0:04:54.301,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The utility company was finally ready to talk concretely

100
0:04:57.39,000 --> 0:04:58,000
about long-term redevelopment.

101
0:05:00.028,000 --> 0:05:03,000
That meeting was kind of a disaster.

102
0:05:04.8,000 --> 0:05:05,000
There was a lot of yelling and anger.

103
0:05:06.586,000 --> 0:05:07,000
People asked things like,

104
0:05:08.19,000 --> 0:05:1,000
"If you're going to sell it to a developer,

105
0:05:10.214,000 --> 0:05:12,000
wouldn't they just build luxury condos like everyone else?"

106
0:05:13.15,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And "Where has the city been?"

107
0:05:14.945,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"Why aren't there more jobs and resources in this neighborhood?"

108
0:05:19.619,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It was not that our events had failed to bring joy.

109
0:05:23.935,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But in spite of that, there was still pain here.

110
0:05:27.995,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Pain from a history of environmental injustice

111
0:05:30.218,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that left many industrial uses in this neighborhood,

112
0:05:34.174,000 --> 0:05:36,000
leaving residents living near toxic waste

113
0:05:36.329,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and, literally, shit.

114
0:05:39.275,000 --> 0:05:4,000
There's pain from the fact

115
0:05:40.586,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that this zip code still has one of the lowest per capita income,

116
0:05:45.312,000 --> 0:05:46,000
highest unemployment

117
0:05:46.645,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and highest incarceration rates

118
0:05:48.326,000 --> 0:05:52,000
in a city which tech giants like Twitter, Airbnb and Uber call home.

119
0:05:53.81,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And those tech companies --

120
0:05:55.531,000 --> 0:05:56,000
hm --

121
0:05:56.84,000 --> 0:05:58,000
they've actually helped to trigger a gentrification push

122
0:05:59.523,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that is rapidly redefining this neighborhood,

123
0:06:01.644,000 --> 0:06:03,000
both in terms of identity and population.

124
0:06:05.299,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Now let me pause for a moment to talk about gentrification.

125
0:06:10.578,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I suspect for a lot of us, it's kind of like a dirty word.

126
0:06:15.35,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It's become synonymous with the displacement

127
0:06:17.495,000 --> 0:06:18,000
of poor residents from their neighborhood

128
0:06:19.516,000 --> 0:06:2,000
by wealthier newcomers.

129
0:06:21.355,000 --> 0:06:23,000
If you've ever been displaced,

130
0:06:23.668,000 --> 0:06:26,000
then you know the agony of losing a place that held your story.

131
0:06:28.176,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And if you haven't experienced this,

132
0:06:30.764,000 --> 0:06:33,000
then I'm going to ask you to try and imagine your way into it right now.

133
0:06:35.039,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Think about what it would be like to find your favorite local spot,

134
0:06:38.556,000 --> 0:06:41,000
a place where you often went and hung out with the old-timers or your friends,

135
0:06:43.486,000 --> 0:06:44,000
had vanished.

136
0:06:45.687,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And then you get home,

137
0:06:46.862,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and you find a letter from your landlord,

138
0:06:48.836,000 --> 0:06:49,000
saying that your rent's been doubled.

139
0:06:51.734,000 --> 0:06:52,000
The choice to stay --

140
0:06:54.301,000 --> 0:06:55,000
it's not yours to make.

141
0:06:56.737,000 --> 0:06:57,000
You no longer belong in your home.

142
0:07:00.607,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And know that this feeling you're feeling right now,

143
0:07:04.71,000 --> 0:07:05,000
it would be the same

144
0:07:06.09,000 --> 0:07:09,000
regardless of whether or not the person who harmed you meant to do so.

145
0:07:12.019,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Developer Majora Carter once said to me,

146
0:07:15.087,000 --> 0:07:17,000
"Poor people don't hate gentrification.

147
0:07:17.533,000 --> 0:07:2,000
They just hate that they rarely get to hang around long enough

148
0:07:20.841,000 --> 0:07:21,000
to enjoy its benefits."

149
0:07:23.97,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Why is it that we treat culture erasure and economic displacement as inevitable?

150
0:07:30.93,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We could approach development

151
0:07:32.401,000 --> 0:07:34,000
with an acknowledgment of past injustices --

152
0:07:35.043,000 --> 0:07:36,000
find value not only in those new stories

153
0:07:37.03,000 --> 0:07:38,000
but the old ones, too.

154
0:07:39.145,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And make a commitment to build people's capacity to stay --

155
0:07:43.681,000 --> 0:07:45,000
to stay in their homes,

156
0:07:45.801,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to stay in their communities,

157
0:07:47.952,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to stay where they feel whole.

158
0:07:52.297,000 --> 0:07:53,000
But to do this rethink,

159
0:07:54.047,000 --> 0:07:57,000
it requires looking at those past injustices

160
0:07:57.235,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and the pain and grief that is interwoven into them.

161
0:08:00.474,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And as I started to reflect on my own work,

162
0:08:03.276,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I realized that pain and grief have been recurring themes.

163
0:08:07.142,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I heard it early on in the Bayview Hunters Point project

164
0:08:09.795,000 --> 0:08:1,000
when a man named Daryl said,

165
0:08:11.7,000 --> 0:08:13,000
"We've always been set aside like an island --

166
0:08:14.103,000 --> 0:08:15,000
a no-man's-land."

167
0:08:16.78,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I also heard it in Houston,

168
0:08:18.257,000 --> 0:08:2,000
when I was working on a project with day laborers.

169
0:08:20.615,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And as Juan told me stories of being robbed of his wages many times

170
0:08:23.892,000 --> 0:08:25,000
on the corner in which he stood every day

171
0:08:26.424,000 --> 0:08:28,000
to earn a living to support his family,

172
0:08:29.019,000 --> 0:08:3,000
he asked,

173
0:08:30.194,000 --> 0:08:32,000
"Why can't anyone see the sacredness of this site?"

174
0:08:34.757,000 --> 0:08:36,000
You know, you've seen the pain, too.

175
0:08:38.604,000 --> 0:08:41,000
From campaigns around statue removals in Charlottesville and New Orleans ...

176
0:08:43.796,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to towns that have lost their industrial lifeblood

177
0:08:46.154,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and are now dying,

178
0:08:47.352,000 --> 0:08:49,000
like Lorain, Ohio and Bolton, England.

179
0:08:51.212,000 --> 0:08:54,000
We often rush to remake these places,

180
0:08:54.578,000 --> 0:08:56,000
thinking that we can ease their pain.

181
0:08:58.248,000 --> 0:09:,000
But in our boundless desire to do good,

182
0:09:01.204,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to get past all of our mistakes,

183
0:09:02.815,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to build places that hold possibility,

184
0:09:06.849,000 --> 0:09:08,000
we often maintain a blissful ignorance

185
0:09:10.971,000 --> 0:09:14,000
of a landscape filled with a very long trail of broken promises

186
0:09:15.89,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and squelched dreams.

187
0:09:18.634,000 --> 0:09:2,000
We are building on top of brokenness.

188
0:09:22.763,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Is it any wonder that the foundations cannot hold?

189
0:09:27.411,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Holding space for pain and grief was never part of my job description

190
0:09:30.72,000 --> 0:09:31,000
as an architect --

191
0:09:32.274,000 --> 0:09:33,000
after all, it's not expedient,

192
0:09:34.284,000 --> 0:09:35,000
focused on beauty,

193
0:09:35.88,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and hell, even requested by my clients.

194
0:09:40.35,000 --> 0:09:43,000
But I've seen what happens when there's space for pain.

195
0:09:43.52,000 --> 0:09:44,000
It can be transformational.

196
0:09:46.663,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Returning to our story,

197
0:09:48.203,000 --> 0:09:51,000
when we first started working in the neighborhood,

198
0:09:51.371,000 --> 0:09:52,000
one of the first things we did

199
0:09:52.824,000 --> 0:09:55,000
was go out and interview the activists who had led the fight to close the plant.

200
0:09:57.195,000 --> 0:10:,000
We consistently heard and felt from them a sense of impending loss.

201
0:10:01.48,000 --> 0:10:02,000
The neighborhood was already changing,

202
0:10:03.371,000 --> 0:10:04,000
even back then.

203
0:10:04.546,000 --> 0:10:06,000
People were leaving or dying of old age,

204
0:10:06.618,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and with those departures, stories were being lost.

205
0:10:10.397,000 --> 0:10:11,000
To those activists,

206
0:10:12.378,000 --> 0:10:14,000
no one was going to know the amazing things

207
0:10:14.817,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that had happened in this community,

208
0:10:16.994,000 --> 0:10:18,000
because to everyone on the outside,

209
0:10:19.397,000 --> 0:10:2,000
it was the ghetto.

210
0:10:21.468,000 --> 0:10:22,000
At worst, a place of violence;

211
0:10:22.977,000 --> 0:10:24,000
at best, a blank slate.

212
0:10:26.682,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Neither was true, of course.

213
0:10:29.344,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So my colleagues and I, we reached out to StoryCorps.

214
0:10:33.425,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And with their support,

215
0:10:34.6,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and that of the utility company,

216
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
we built a listening booth on our site.

217
0:10:38.459,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And we invited the residents to come

218
0:10:40.252,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and have their stories recorded for posterity.

219
0:10:43.515,000 --> 0:10:45,000
After a few days of recording,

220
0:10:46.148,000 --> 0:10:47,000
we held a listening party

221
0:10:48.695,000 --> 0:10:49,000
where we played clips,

222
0:10:49.87,000 --> 0:10:51,000
much like what you hear on NPR every Friday morning.

223
0:10:53.625,000 --> 0:10:54,000
That party --

224
0:10:55.387,000 --> 0:10:57,000
it was one of the most amazing community meetings

225
0:10:57.797,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I've ever been a part of.

226
0:10:59.925,000 --> 0:11:01,000
In part because we didn't just talk about joy

227
0:11:03.238,000 --> 0:11:04,000
but also pain.

228
0:11:05.833,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Two stories that I remember well --

229
0:11:07.659,000 --> 0:11:1,000
AJ talked about what it was like to grow up in the neighborhood.

230
0:11:10.78,000 --> 0:11:11,000
There was always a kid to play with.

231
0:11:13.023,000 --> 0:11:14,000
But he also spoke with sadness

232
0:11:14.915,000 --> 0:11:17,000
of what it was like to first be stopped and questioned by a police officer

233
0:11:18.416,000 --> 0:11:19,000
when he was 11.

234
0:11:21.267,000 --> 0:11:23,000
GL also talked about the kids,

235
0:11:23.62,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and the ups and downs of the experience of living in this neighborhood,

236
0:11:27.42,000 --> 0:11:28,000
but he also spoke with pride

237
0:11:29.159,000 --> 0:11:31,000
of some of the organizations that had sprung up

238
0:11:31.627,000 --> 0:11:33,000
to provide support and empowerment.

239
0:11:34.696,000 --> 0:11:35,000
He wanted to see more of that.

240
0:11:37.026,000 --> 0:11:4,000
By holding space to first express pain and grief,

241
0:11:40.891,000 --> 0:11:43,000
we were then able to brainstorm ideas for a site --

242
0:11:43.939,000 --> 0:11:47,000
amazing ideas that then became the seeds of what we did over the next four years.

243
0:11:49.486,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So why the radically different meeting now?

244
0:11:52.212,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Well ...

245
0:11:53.7,000 --> 0:11:56,000
the pain and grief woven into these spaces was not created in a day.

246
0:11:58.164,000 --> 0:12:,000
Healing also takes time.

247
0:12:02.328,000 --> 0:12:06,000
After all, who here thinks you can go to therapy just once and be cured?

248
0:12:06.644,000 --> 0:12:07,000
(Laughter)

249
0:12:08.04,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Anyone?

250
0:12:10.181,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I didn't think so.

251
0:12:12.135,000 --> 0:12:13,000
In retrospect,

252
0:12:13.681,000 --> 0:12:15,000
I wish that we had held more listening sessions,

253
0:12:16.559,000 --> 0:12:17,000
not just joyful events.

254
0:12:19.645,000 --> 0:12:21,000
My work's taken me all over the world,

255
0:12:22.916,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and I have yet to set foot in a place where pain didn't exist

256
0:12:27.361,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and the potential for healing was absent.

257
0:12:30.311,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So while I've spent my career honing my skills as an architect,

258
0:12:33.701,000 --> 0:12:35,000
I realize that I'm now also a healer.

259
0:12:37.869,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I suppose this is the point in the talk where I should be telling you

260
0:12:41.133,000 --> 0:12:42,000
those five steps to healing,

261
0:12:42.492,000 --> 0:12:43,000
but I don't have the solution --

262
0:12:44.205,000 --> 0:12:45,000
yet.

263
0:12:45.568,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Just a path.

264
0:12:47.772,000 --> 0:12:48,000
That being said,

265
0:12:48.947,000 --> 0:12:5,000
there are a few things I have learned along the way.

266
0:12:51.772,000 --> 0:12:52,000
First --

267
0:12:53.418,000 --> 0:12:55,000
we cannot create cities for everyone

268
0:12:56.059,000 --> 0:12:58,000
unless we're first willing to listen to everyone.

269
0:12:59.684,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Not just about what they hope to see built in the future

270
0:13:02.375,000 --> 0:13:04,000
but also about what has been lost or unfulfilled.

271
0:13:06.771,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Second --

272
0:13:08.357,000 --> 0:13:1,000
healing is not just for "those people."

273
0:13:11.969,000 --> 0:13:13,000
For those of us with privilege,

274
0:13:14.21,000 --> 0:13:17,000
we have to have a reckoning with our own guilt,

275
0:13:17.857,000 --> 0:13:19,000
discomfort and complicity.

276
0:13:21.574,000 --> 0:13:23,000
As non-profit leader Anne Marks once observed,

277
0:13:24.098,000 --> 0:13:26,000
"Hurt people hurt people;

278
0:13:26.325,000 --> 0:13:28,000
healed people heal people."

279
0:13:30.424,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And third --

280
0:13:32.611,000 --> 0:13:34,000
healing is not about the erasure of pain.

281
0:13:35.822,000 --> 0:13:38,000
We often have a tendency to want to put a clean slate over our pain,

282
0:13:39.316,000 --> 0:13:41,000
much like that asphalt on the soil in Bayview Hunters Point.

283
0:13:42.602,000 --> 0:13:43,000
But it doesn't work that way.

284
0:13:44.768,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Healing is about acknowledging pain

285
0:13:47.472,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and making peace with it.

286
0:13:50.484,000 --> 0:13:54,000
One of my favorite quotes says that healing renews our faith

287
0:13:54.749,000 --> 0:13:55,000
in the process of becoming.

288
0:13:57.996,000 --> 0:13:59,000
I stand here before you as an architect-healer

289
0:14:00.278,000 --> 0:14:02,000
because I'm ready to see what I can become,

290
0:14:03.022,000 --> 0:14:05,000
what my community and those that I work with can become,

291
0:14:05.673,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and what this country,

292
0:14:06.848,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and frankly, this world can become.

293
0:14:09.099,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And I was not meant to take that journey alone.

294
0:14:13.202,000 --> 0:14:17,000
I believe that many of you are unhappy with the way that things are now.

295
0:14:19.202,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Believe that it can be different.

296
0:14:22.89,000 --> 0:14:26,000
I believe that you all are far more resilient than you think.

297
0:14:28.419,000 --> 0:14:3,000
But the first step requires courage.

298
0:14:32.343,000 --> 0:14:34,000
The courage to see each other's pain,

299
0:14:35.787,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and to be willing to stay in the presence of it,

300
0:14:38.737,000 --> 0:14:39,000
even when it gets uncomfortable.

301
0:14:41.737,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Just imagine the change that we can make together

302
0:14:46.428,000 --> 0:14:47,000
if we all committed to that.

303
0:14:49.323,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Thank you.

304
0:14:50.498,000 --> 0:14:56,000
(Applause)

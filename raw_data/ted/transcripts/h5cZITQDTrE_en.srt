1
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Thank you.

2
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me.

3
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I feel it's sort of like the Vimalakirti Sutra,

4
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:46,000
an ancient work from ancient India

5
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:52,000
in which the Buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people

6
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:56,000
come to see him from the biggest city in the area, Vaishali,

7
0:00:56,000 --> 0:01:,000
and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him.

8
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:03,000
All the young people, actually, from the city.

9
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:08,000
The old fogeys don't come because they're mad at Buddha,

10
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
because when he came to their city he accepted --

11
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:14,000
he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him, from whoever it is,

12
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and the local geisha, a movie-star sort of person,

13
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:21,000
raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first.

14
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So he was hanging out with the movie star, and of course they were grumbling:

15
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:27,000
"He's supposed to be religious and all this.

16
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:32,000
What's he doing over there at Amrapali's house with all his 500 monks,"

17
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and so on. They were all grumbling, and so they boycotted him.

18
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:37,000
They wouldn't go listen to him.

19
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But the young people all came.

20
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol, and they put it on the ground.

21
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And as soon as they had laid all these,

22
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:5,000
all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient India,

23
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:57,000
he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium,

24
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:,000
the wonder of the universe. Everyone looked in that, and they saw in there

25
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes.

26
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And of course, in the Buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets

27
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:1,000
with human life on it,

28
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets.

29
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So they don't -- when they look out and they see those lights that you showed

30
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in the sky -- they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning

31
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:24,000
or rocks or flames or gases exploding.

32
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:26,000
They actually see landscapes and human beings

33
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that.

34
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:34,000
He made that special effect at the beginning

35
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:37,000
to get everyone to think about interconnection

36
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected.

37
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And then Leilei -- I know his other name -- told us about interconnection,

38
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and how we're all totally interconnected here,

39
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and how we've all known each other. And of course in the Buddhist universe,

40
0:02:56,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we've already done this already billions of times in many, many lifetimes in the past.

41
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And I didn't give the talk always. You did, and we had to watch you, and so forth.

42
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And we're all still trying to, I guess we're all trying to become TEDsters,

43
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:18,000
if that's a modern form of enlightenment.

44
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I guess so. Because in a way, if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness

45
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:28,000
of all the computers and everything, it's the forging of a mass awareness,

46
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:3,000
of where everybody can really know everything

47
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that's going on everywhere in the planet.

48
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And therefore it will become intolerable --

49
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:38,000
what compassion is, is where it will become intolerable for us,

50
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:44,000
totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying

51
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:46,000
the life of the mind or whatever it is,

52
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease

53
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place,

54
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:57,000
or they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth.

55
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It just becomes intolerable.

56
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:05,000
With all of us knowing everything, we're kind of forced by technology

57
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to become Buddhas or something, to become enlightened.

58
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And of course, we all will be deeply disappointed when we do.

59
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do,

60
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:24,000
a little bit tired, we do suffer.

61
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We do enjoy our misery in a certain way.

62
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:3,000
We distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere,

63
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:32,000
but basically we all have this common misery

64
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that we are sort of stuck inside our skins

65
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and everyone else is out there.

66
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin

67
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and the two of us enjoy each other, and each one tries to get out of their own,

68
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and ultimately it fails of course, and then we're back into this thing.

69
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Because our egocentric perception -- from the Buddha's point of view, misperception --

70
0:04:56,000 --> 0:05:,000
is that all we are is what is inside our skin.

71
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And it's inside and outside, self and other,

72
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and other is all very different.

73
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception,

74
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:1,000
a little bit, right?

75
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:13,000
You know, someone sitting next to you in a seat -- that's OK because you're in a theater,

76
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:16,000
but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you,

77
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
you'd freak out.

78
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:21,000
What do they want from me? Like, who's that?

79
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And so you wouldn't sit that close to another person

80
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:3,000
because of your notion that it's you versus the universe -- that's all Buddha discovered.

81
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone, each of us,

82
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and everyone else is different,

83
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:41,000
then that puts us in an impossible situation, doesn't it?

84
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Who is it who's going to get enough attention from the world?

85
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Who's going to get enough out of the world?

86
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Who's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings --

87
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:53,000
if you're different from all the other beings?

88
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So where compassion comes is where you

89
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:02,000
surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way:

90
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:07,000
through art, through meditation, through understanding, through knowledge actually,

91
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:09,000
knowing that you have no such boundary,

92
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:12,000
knowing your interconnectedness with other beings.

93
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:15,000
You can experience yourself as the other beings

94
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:2,000
when you see through the delusion of being separated from them.

95
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:23,000
When you do that, you're forced to feel what they feel.

96
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Luckily, they say -- I still am not sure --

97
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:31,000
but luckily, they say that when you reach that point because some people have said

98
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:34,000
in the Buddhist literature, they say, "Oh who would really want to be compassionate?

99
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:39,000
How awful! I'm so miserable on my own. My head is aching.

100
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:42,000
My bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied.

101
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I never have enough, even if I'm a billionaire, I don't have enough.

102
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I need a hundred billion." So I'm like that.

103
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Imagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people's suffering.

104
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It would be terrible.

105
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But apparently, this is a strange paradox of life.

106
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:03,000
When you're no longer locked in yourself,

107
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge

108
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:14,000
of the nature of the world, that enables you to let your mind spread out,

109
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and empathize, and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing,

110
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and realizing that you are the other being,

111
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:27,000
somehow by that opening, you can see the deeper nature of life. And you can,

112
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:35,000
you get away from this terrible iron circle of I, me, me, mine,

113
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:37,000
like the Beatles used to sing.

114
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:39,000
You know, we really learned everything in the '60s.

115
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Too bad nobody ever woke up to it,

116
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and they've been trying to suppress it since then.

117
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I, me, me, mine. It's like a perfect song, that song. A perfect teaching.

118
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:53,000
But when we're relieved from that,

119
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:55,000
we somehow then become interested in all the other beings.

120
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And we feel ourselves differently. It's totally strange.

121
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It's totally strange.

122
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:04,000
The Dalai Lama always likes to say --

123
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:09,000
he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion,

124
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:13,000
it's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures

125
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:17,000
are finally too small a theater for your intelligence.

126
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that, or what, you know --

127
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and the more you focus on how you feel, by the way, the worse it gets.

128
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Like, even when you're having a good time,

129
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:32,000
when is the good time over?

130
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:36,000
The good time is over when you think, how good is it?

131
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And then it's never good enough.

132
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I love that Leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly

133
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:49,000
on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time,

134
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:51,000
doing it by having a good time.

135
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I think the Dalai Lama should have heard that. I wish he'd been there to hear that.

136
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:56,000
He once told me -- he looked kind of sad;

137
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:58,000
he worries very much about the haves and have-nots.

138
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:02,000
He looked a little sad, because he said, well, a hundred years ago,

139
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:05,000
they went and took everything away from the haves.

140
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:08,000
You know, the big communist revolutions, Russia and China and so forth.

141
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:1,000
They took it all away by violence,

142
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:14,000
saying they were going to give it to everyone, and then they were even worse.

143
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:16,000
They didn't help at all.

144
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today?

145
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And so then he looks at me.

146
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So I said, "Well, you know, you're all in this yourself. You teach: it's generosity,"

147
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:32,000
was all I could think of. What is virtue?

148
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But of course, what you said, I think the key to saving the world, the key to compassion

149
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:42,000
is that it is more fun.

150
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:47,000
It should be done by fun. Generosity is more fun. That's the key.

151
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Everybody has the wrong idea. They think Buddha was so boring,

152
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and they're so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he's fairly jolly.

153
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Even though his people are being genocided --

154
0:09:57,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and believe me, he feels every blow on every old nun's head,

155
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:05,000
in every Chinese prison. He feels it.

156
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:08,000
He feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays.

157
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I won't even say what they do. But he feels it.

158
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And yet he's very jolly. He's extremely jolly.

159
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Because when you open up like that,

160
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:25,000
then you can't just -- what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery?

161
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:28,000
You have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is,

162
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:3,000
how it can be changed.

163
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Look at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us. She scared us with the lava man.

164
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:37,000
She scared us with the lava man is coming,

165
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:39,000
then the tsunami is coming,

166
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:45,000
but then finally there were flowers and trees, and it was very beautiful.

167
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:47,000
It's really lovely.

168
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So, compassion means to feel the feelings of others,

169
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and the human being actually is compassion.

170
0:10:56,000 --> 0:11:,000
The human being is almost out of time.

171
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:04,000
The human being is compassion because what is our brain for?

172
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Now, Jim's brain is memorizing the almanac.

173
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:15,000
But he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is, he will, he did.

174
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:2,000
He could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings.

175
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And he would have tremendous fun doing that.

176
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So the first person who gets happy,

177
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:3,000
when you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of, how happy am I,

178
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:32,000
where you're always dissatisfied --

179
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:37,000
as Mick Jagger told us. You never get any satisfaction that way.

180
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So then you decide, "Well, I'm sick of myself.

181
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:42,000
I'm going to think of how other people can be happy.

182
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I'm going to get up in the morning and think,

183
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:47,000
what can I do for even one other person, even a dog, my dog, my cat,

184
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:5,000
my pet, my butterfly?"

185
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And the first person who gets happy when you do that,

186
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:57,000
you don't do anything for anybody else, but you get happier, you yourself,

187
0:11:57,000 --> 0:12:,000
because your whole perception broadens

188
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it.

189
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And you realize that this -- being with these people --

190
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:08,000
is the flower garden that Chiho showed us.

191
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:1,000
It is Nirvana.

192
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And my time is up. And I know the TED commandments.

193
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Thank you.

1
0:00:15.368,000 --> 0:00:18,000
We conventionally divide space

2
0:00:18.771,000 --> 0:00:19,000
into private and public realms,

3
0:00:20.333,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and we know these legal distinctions very well

4
0:00:23.6,000 --> 0:00:24,000
because we've become experts

5
0:00:25.608,000 --> 0:00:28,000
at protecting our private property and private space.

6
0:00:29.468,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But we're less attuned

7
0:00:31.372,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to the nuances of the public.

8
0:00:34.927,000 --> 0:00:37,000
What translates generic public space into qualitative space?

9
0:00:38.85,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I mean, this is something

10
0:00:40.256,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that our studio has been working on

11
0:00:42.081,000 --> 0:00:43,000
for the past decade.

12
0:00:43.589,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And we're doing this through some case studies.

13
0:00:45.852,000 --> 0:00:46,000
A large chunk of our work

14
0:00:47.341,000 --> 0:00:48,000
has been put into transforming

15
0:00:48.881,000 --> 0:00:5,000
this neglected industrial ruin

16
0:00:51.677,000 --> 0:00:54,000
into a viable post-industrial space

17
0:00:54.75,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that looks forward and backward

18
0:00:56.251,000 --> 0:00:57,000
at the same time.

19
0:00:57.512,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And another huge chunk of our work

20
0:01:00.014,000 --> 0:01:02,000
has gone into making relevant

21
0:01:02.052,000 --> 0:01:04,000
a site that's grown out of sync with its time.

22
0:01:04.748,000 --> 0:01:07,000
We've been working on democratizing Lincoln Center

23
0:01:07.792,000 --> 0:01:1,000
for a public that doesn't usually have $300

24
0:01:11.51,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to spend on an opera ticket.

25
0:01:15.275,000 --> 0:01:16,000
So we've been eating, drinking,

26
0:01:16.966,000 --> 0:01:18,000
thinking, living public space

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
for quite a long time.

28
0:01:21.231,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And it's taught us really one thing,

29
0:01:23.5,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and that is to truly make good public space,

30
0:01:27.468,000 --> 0:01:3,000
you have to erase the distinctions

31
0:01:30.718,000 --> 0:01:32,000
between architecture, urbanism,

32
0:01:33.343,000 --> 0:01:34,000
landscape, media design

33
0:01:35.218,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and so on.

34
0:01:36.802,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It really goes beyond distinction.

35
0:01:38.831,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Now we're moving onto Washington, D.C.

36
0:01:41.885,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and we're working on another transformation,

37
0:01:44.218,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and that is for the existing Hirshhorn Museum

38
0:01:46.843,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that's sited

39
0:01:48.468,000 --> 0:01:5,000
on the most revered public space in America,

40
0:01:50.76,000 --> 0:01:52,000
the National Mall.

41
0:01:53.693,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The Mall is a symbol

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
of American democracy.

43
0:01:58.093,000 --> 0:02:,000
And what's fantastic is that this symbol

44
0:02:01.093,000 --> 0:02:03,000
is not a thing, it's not an image,

45
0:02:03.302,000 --> 0:02:04,000
it's not an artifact,

46
0:02:05.01,000 --> 0:02:06,000
actually it's a space,

47
0:02:06.718,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and it's kind of just defined by a line of buildings

48
0:02:09.568,000 --> 0:02:11,000
on either side.

49
0:02:11.599,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's a space where citizens can voice their discontent

50
0:02:15.343,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and show their power.

51
0:02:16.636,000 --> 0:02:18,000
It's a place where pivotal moments in American history

52
0:02:19.552,000 --> 0:02:21,000
have taken place.

53
0:02:21.708,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And they're inscribed in there forever --

54
0:02:24.114,000 --> 0:02:26,000
like the march on Washington for jobs and freedom

55
0:02:26.493,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and the great speech that Martin Luther King gave there.

56
0:02:29.585,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The Vietnam protests, the commemoration of all that died

57
0:02:33.968,000 --> 0:02:35,000
in the pandemic of AIDS,

58
0:02:36.01,000 --> 0:02:38,000
the march for women's reproductive rights,

59
0:02:38.552,000 --> 0:02:41,000
right up until almost the present.

60
0:02:42.01,000 --> 0:02:45,000
The Mall is the greatest civic stage

61
0:02:45.172,000 --> 0:02:48,000
in this country for dissent.

62
0:02:48.843,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And it's synonymous with free speech,

63
0:02:52.731,000 --> 0:02:54,000
even if you're not sure what it is that you have to say.

64
0:02:55.422,000 --> 0:03:,000
It may just be a place for civic commiseration.

65
0:03:00.452,000 --> 0:03:03,000
There is a huge disconnect, we believe,

66
0:03:04.093,000 --> 0:03:08,000
between the communicative and discursive space of the Mall

67
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and the museums that line it to either side.

68
0:03:12.302,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And that is that those museums are usually passive,

69
0:03:15.927,000 --> 0:03:18,000
they have passive relationships between the museum

70
0:03:19.302,000 --> 0:03:2,000
as the presenter and the audience,

71
0:03:20.946,000 --> 0:03:22,000
as the receiver of information.

72
0:03:23.218,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And so you can see dinosaurs

73
0:03:24.968,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and insects and collections of locomotives

74
0:03:29.052,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and all of that,

75
0:03:30.377,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but you're really not involved;

76
0:03:31.908,000 --> 0:03:32,000
you're being talked to.

77
0:03:33.552,000 --> 0:03:37,000
When Richard Koshalek took over as director of the Hirshhorn

78
0:03:38.255,000 --> 0:03:39,000
in 2009,

79
0:03:40.052,000 --> 0:03:42,000
he was determined to take advantage

80
0:03:42.468,000 --> 0:03:45,000
of the fact that this museum was sited

81
0:03:45.718,000 --> 0:03:46,000
at the most unique place:

82
0:03:47.468,000 --> 0:03:48,000
at the seat of power in the U.S.

83
0:03:49.343,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And while art and politics

84
0:03:51.552,000 --> 0:03:56,000
are inherently and implicitly together always and all the time,

85
0:03:57.01,000 --> 0:04:01,000
there could be some very special relationship

86
0:04:01.177,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that could be forged here in its uniqueness.

87
0:04:05.093,000 --> 0:04:07,000
The question is, is it possible ultimately

88
0:04:07.718,000 --> 0:04:08,000
for art to insert itself

89
0:04:09.468,000 --> 0:04:12,000
into the dialogue of national and world affairs?

90
0:04:12.593,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And could the museum be an agent of cultural diplomacy?

91
0:04:16.462,000 --> 0:04:21,000
There are over 180 embassies in Washington D.C.

92
0:04:21.523,000 --> 0:04:23,000
There are over 500 think tanks.

93
0:04:24.51,000 --> 0:04:25,000
There should be a way

94
0:04:26.01,000 --> 0:04:28,000
of harnessing all of that intellectual and global energy

95
0:04:28.927,000 --> 0:04:3,000
into, and somehow through, the museum.

96
0:04:31.077,000 --> 0:04:34,000
There should be some kind of brain trust.

97
0:04:34.156,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So the Hirshhorn, as we began to think about it,

98
0:04:37.468,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and as we evolved the mission,

99
0:04:39.968,000 --> 0:04:4,000
with Richard and his team --

100
0:04:41.802,000 --> 0:04:43,000
it's really his life blood.

101
0:04:43.927,000 --> 0:04:47,000
But beyond exhibiting contemporary art,

102
0:04:48.012,000 --> 0:04:5,000
the Hirshhorn will become a public forum,

103
0:04:50.802,000 --> 0:04:52,000
a place of discourse

104
0:04:52.927,000 --> 0:04:54,000
for issues around arts,

105
0:04:55.135,000 --> 0:05:,000
culture, politics and policy.

106
0:05:00.218,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It would have the global reach of the World Economic Forum.

107
0:05:04.218,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference.

108
0:05:07.1,000 --> 0:05:11,000
It would have the informality of the town square.

109
0:05:11.558,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And for this new initiative,

110
0:05:13.487,000 --> 0:05:14,000
the Hirshhorn would have to expand

111
0:05:15.302,000 --> 0:05:16,000
or appropriate a site

112
0:05:16.679,000 --> 0:05:18,000
for a contemporary, deployable structure.

113
0:05:19.573,000 --> 0:05:2,000
This is it. This is the Hirshhorn --

114
0:05:21.312,000 --> 0:05:24,000
so a 230-foot-diameter concrete doughnut

115
0:05:24.427,000 --> 0:05:26,000
designed in the early '70s

116
0:05:26.635,000 --> 0:05:27,000
by Gordon Bunshaft.

117
0:05:28.387,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It's hulking, it's silent,

118
0:05:29.677,000 --> 0:05:3,000
it's cloistered, it's arrogant,

119
0:05:31.427,000 --> 0:05:33,000
it's a design challenge.

120
0:05:33.76,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Architects love to hate it.

121
0:05:35.333,000 --> 0:05:36,000
One redeeming feature

122
0:05:37.343,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is it's lifted up off the ground

123
0:05:39.052,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and it's got this void,

124
0:05:40.802,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and it's got an empty core

125
0:05:42.427,000 --> 0:05:44,000
kind of in the spirit and that facade

126
0:05:45.343,000 --> 0:05:48,000
very much corporate and federal style.

127
0:05:49.093,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And around that space,

128
0:05:51.01,000 --> 0:05:52,000
the ring is actually galleries.

129
0:05:52.552,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Very, very difficult to mount shows in there.

130
0:05:55.177,000 --> 0:05:56,000
When the Hirshhorn opened,

131
0:05:57.135,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Ada Louise Huxstable, the New York Times critic,

132
0:05:59.445,000 --> 0:06:,000
had some choice words:

133
0:06:00.956,000 --> 0:06:01,000
"Neo-penitentiary modern."

134
0:06:02.758,000 --> 0:06:04,000
"A maimed monument and a maimed Mall

135
0:06:05.617,000 --> 0:06:06,000
for a maimed collection."

136
0:06:07.052,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Almost four decades later,

137
0:06:08.808,000 --> 0:06:09,000
how will this building expand

138
0:06:10.552,000 --> 0:06:12,000
for a new progressive program?

139
0:06:12.581,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Where would it go?

140
0:06:14.093,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It can't go in the Mall.

141
0:06:15.335,000 --> 0:06:16,000
There is no space there.

142
0:06:16.592,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It can't go in the courtyard.

143
0:06:18.135,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It's already taken up by landscape and by sculptures.

144
0:06:23.343,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Well there's always the hole.

145
0:06:24.748,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But how could it take the space of that hole

146
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and not be buried in it invisibly?

147
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
How could it become iconic?

148
0:06:33.01,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And what language would it take?

149
0:06:36.558,000 --> 0:06:39,000
The Hirshhorn sits among the Mall's monumental institutions.

150
0:06:39.76,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Most are neoclassical, heavy and opaque,

151
0:06:42.604,000 --> 0:06:44,000
made of stone or concrete.

152
0:06:45.402,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And the question is,

153
0:06:47.292,000 --> 0:06:48,000
if one inhabits that space,

154
0:06:48.708,000 --> 0:06:51,000
what is the material of the Mall?

155
0:06:52.07,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It has to be different from the buildings there.

156
0:06:54.718,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It has to be something entirely different.

157
0:06:56.742,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It has to be air.

158
0:06:58.53,000 --> 0:07:,000
In our imagination, it has to be light.

159
0:07:01.052,000 --> 0:07:03,000
It has to be ephemeral. It has to be formless.

160
0:07:03.267,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And it has to be free.

161
0:07:05.291,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Video)

162
0:07:16.647,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So this is the big idea.

163
0:07:19.778,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It's a giant airbag.

164
0:07:22.343,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The expansion takes the shape of its container

165
0:07:25.998,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and it oozes out wherever it can --

166
0:07:27.737,000 --> 0:07:28,000
the top and sides.

167
0:07:29.76,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But more poetically,

168
0:07:31.51,000 --> 0:07:33,000
we like to think of the structure

169
0:07:33.552,000 --> 0:07:35,000
as inhaling the democratic air of the Mall,

170
0:07:35.624,000 --> 0:07:38,000
bringing it into itself.

171
0:07:39.385,000 --> 0:07:42,000
The before and the after.

172
0:07:43.356,000 --> 0:07:46,000
It was dubbed "the bubble" by the press.

173
0:07:46.51,000 --> 0:07:48,000
That was the lounge.

174
0:07:49.052,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It's basically one big volume of air

175
0:07:52.014,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that just oozes out in every direction.

176
0:07:54.302,000 --> 0:07:56,000
The membrane is translucent.

177
0:07:56.335,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It's made of silcon-coated glass fiber.

178
0:08:00.024,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And it's inflated twice a year for one month at a time.

179
0:08:04.116,000 --> 0:08:07,000
This is the view from the inside.

180
0:08:07.301,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So you might have been wondering

181
0:08:09.147,000 --> 0:08:1,000
how in the world

182
0:08:11.125,000 --> 0:08:13,000
did we get this approved by the federal government.

183
0:08:13.578,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It had to be approved by actually two agencies.

184
0:08:17.458,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And one is there to preserve

185
0:08:21.343,000 --> 0:08:23,000
the dignity and sanctity of the Mall.

186
0:08:23.708,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I blush whenever I show this.

187
0:08:26.441,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It is yours to interpret.

188
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
But one thing I can say

189
0:08:32.302,000 --> 0:08:34,000
is that it's a combination

190
0:08:34.76,000 --> 0:08:36,000
of iconoclasm

191
0:08:37.01,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and adoration.

192
0:08:40.637,000 --> 0:08:43,000
There was also some creative interpretation involved.

193
0:08:43.753,000 --> 0:08:45,000
The Congressional Buildings Act of 1910

194
0:08:46.677,000 --> 0:08:47,000
limits the height of buildings in D.C.

195
0:08:48.635,000 --> 0:08:49,000
to 130 feet,

196
0:08:50.593,000 --> 0:08:52,000
except for spires, towers, domes and minarets.

197
0:08:53.468,000 --> 0:08:57,000
This pretty much exempts monuments of the church and state.

198
0:08:58.135,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And the bubble is 153 ft.

199
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
That's the Pantheon next to it.

200
0:09:03.885,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It's about 1.2 million cubic feet of compressed air.

201
0:09:07.177,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And so we argued it

202
0:09:09.093,000 --> 0:09:1,000
on the merits of being a dome.

203
0:09:11.093,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So there it is,

204
0:09:13.177,000 --> 0:09:14,000
very stately,

205
0:09:14.351,000 --> 0:09:17,000
among all the stately buildings in the Mall.

206
0:09:17.802,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And while this Hirshhorn is not landmarked,

207
0:09:20.843,000 --> 0:09:22,000
it's very, very historically sensitive.

208
0:09:23.218,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And so we couldn't really touch its surfaces.

209
0:09:25.593,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We couldn't leave any traces behind.

210
0:09:27.332,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So we strained it from the edges,

211
0:09:29.51,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and we held it by cables.

212
0:09:31.635,000 --> 0:09:34,000
It's a study of some bondage techniques,

213
0:09:35.01,000 --> 0:09:36,000
which are actually very important

214
0:09:36.693,000 --> 0:09:37,000
because it's hit by wind all the time.

215
0:09:38.618,000 --> 0:09:4,000
There's one permanent steel ring at the top,

216
0:09:40.733,000 --> 0:09:42,000
but it can't be seen from any vantage point on the Mall.

217
0:09:43.448,000 --> 0:09:45,000
There are also some restrictions

218
0:09:45.635,000 --> 0:09:46,000
about how much it could be lit.

219
0:09:47.136,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It glows from within, it's translucent.

220
0:09:49.177,000 --> 0:09:52,000
But it can't be more lit than the Capitol

221
0:09:52.343,000 --> 0:09:53,000
or some of the monuments.

222
0:09:53.76,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So it's down the hierarchy on lighting.

223
0:09:56.14,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So it comes to the site twice a year.

224
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
It's taken off the delivery truck.

225
0:10:01.218,000 --> 0:10:02,000
It's hoisted.

226
0:10:02.718,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And then it's inflated

227
0:10:05.01,000 --> 0:10:06,000
with this low-pressure air.

228
0:10:06.76,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And then it's restrained with the cables.

229
0:10:08.737,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And then it's ballasted with water at the very bottom.

230
0:10:11.927,000 --> 0:10:15,000
This is a very strange moment

231
0:10:16.052,000 --> 0:10:18,000
where we were asked by the bureaucracy at the Mall

232
0:10:18.468,000 --> 0:10:21,000
how much time would it take to install.

233
0:10:21.677,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And we said, well the first erection would take one week.

234
0:10:24.416,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And they really connected with that idea.

235
0:10:27.76,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And then it was really easy all the way through.

236
0:10:31.76,000 --> 0:10:35,000
So we didn't really have that many hurdles, I have to say,

237
0:10:35.843,000 --> 0:10:37,000
with the government and all the authorities.

238
0:10:37.915,000 --> 0:10:38,000
But some of the toughest hurdles

239
0:10:39.463,000 --> 0:10:4,000
have been the technical ones.

240
0:10:40.968,000 --> 0:10:41,000
This is the warp and weft.

241
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
This is a point cloud.

242
0:10:44.302,000 --> 0:10:46,000
There are extreme pressures.

243
0:10:46.427,000 --> 0:10:47,000
This is a very, very unusual building

244
0:10:48.213,000 --> 0:10:49,000
in that there's no gravity load,

245
0:10:50.135,000 --> 0:10:51,000
but there's load in every direction.

246
0:10:51.874,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And I'm just going to zip through these slides.

247
0:10:56.427,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And this is the space in action.

248
0:10:59.552,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So flexible interior for discussions,

249
0:11:02.385,000 --> 0:11:04,000
just like this, but in the round --

250
0:11:04.718,000 --> 0:11:05,000
luminous and reconfigurable.

251
0:11:06.177,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Could be used for anything,

252
0:11:08.593,000 --> 0:11:09,000
for performances, films,

253
0:11:10.343,000 --> 0:11:12,000
for installations.

254
0:11:12.885,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And the very first program

255
0:11:15.302,000 --> 0:11:17,000
will be one of cultural dialogue and diplomacy

256
0:11:17.517,000 --> 0:11:18,000
organized in partnership

257
0:11:18.802,000 --> 0:11:2,000
with the Council on Foreign Relations.

258
0:11:21.427,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Form and content are together here.

259
0:11:23.177,000 --> 0:11:25,000
The bubble is an anti-monument.

260
0:11:25.843,000 --> 0:11:27,000
The ideals of participatory democracy

261
0:11:28.385,000 --> 0:11:3,000
are represented through suppleness

262
0:11:30.51,000 --> 0:11:31,000
rather than rigidity.

263
0:11:31.956,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Art and politics

264
0:11:33.385,000 --> 0:11:36,000
occupy an ambiguous site outside the museum walls,

265
0:11:37.025,000 --> 0:11:4,000
but inside of the museum's core,

266
0:11:40.618,000 --> 0:11:41,000
blending its air

267
0:11:42.468,000 --> 0:11:44,000
with the democratic air of the Mall.

268
0:11:44.835,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And the bubble will inflate

269
0:11:50.385,000 --> 0:11:51,000
hopefully for the first time

270
0:11:52.01,000 --> 0:11:54,000
at the end of 2013.

271
0:11:54.218,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Thank you.

272
0:11:56.718,000 --> 0:11:59,000
(Applause)

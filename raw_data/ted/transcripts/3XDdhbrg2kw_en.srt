1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Chris has been so nice.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I don't know how you keep it up, Chris, I really don't.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
So nice, all week. He's the kind of man you could say to,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
"Chris, I'm really sorry, I've crashed your car.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And it gets worse, I crashed it into your house.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Your house has caught fire.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And what's more, your wife has just run off with your best friend."

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And you know that Chris would say, "Thank you."

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
"Thank you for sharing, that's really interesting."

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
"Thank you for taking me to a place that I didn't know existed. Thank you."

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
One of the -- (Applause) Thank you for inviting us.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
One of the things about appearing later on in the TED week is that,

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
gradually, as the days go by,

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Laughter)

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Nuclear fusion, I had about 10 minutes on that.

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Spectroscopy, that was another one.

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Parallel universes.

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And so this morning I thought, "Oh well, I'll just do a card trick."

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
That one's gone as well.

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And today is Emmanuel's day, I think we've agreed that, already, haven't we?

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Emmanuel? Absolutely. (Applause)

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I was planning on finishing on a dance ...

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So, that's going to look pretty shabby now.

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So, what I thought I'd do is -- in honor of Emmanuel --

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
is, what I can do is to launch today the first

32
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
TED Global auction.

33
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
If I could start, this is the Enigma decoding machine.

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Who will start me with $1,000? Anyone?

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Thank you. Bruno's face, just then,

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
he said, "No, don't go through this. Don't, please don't.

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Don't go through this. Don't do it."

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I'm worried. When I first got the invitation,

41
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
they said somewhere in the thing, they said, "15 minutes to change the world,

42
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
your moment onstage." 15 minutes to change the world.

43
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I don't know about you, it takes me 15 minutes to change a plug.

44
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So, the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one.

46
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Well, of course now we know we don't have to change a plug,

47
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
now we've seen that wonderful demonstration

48
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
of the wireless electric -- fantastic. You know, it inspires us.

49
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
300 years ago he'd have been burnt at the stake for that.

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And now it's an idea.

52
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It's great. It's fantastic.

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But you do meet some fantastic people,

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
people who look at the world in a totally different way.

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Yesterday, David Deutsch, another one

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
who covered most of what I was going to say.

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But when you think of the world in that way,

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
it does make going to Starbucks a whole new experience, don't you think?

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I mean, he must walk in and they will say,

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
"Would you like a macchiato,

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
or a latte, or an Americano,

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
or a cappuccino?"

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And he'll say,

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
"You're offering me things that are infinitely variable."

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Laughter)

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
"How can your coffee be true?"

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Laughter)

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And they will say,

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
"Would you mind if I serve the next customer?"

72
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And Elaine Morgan yesterday, wasn't she wonderful?

74
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Fantastic. Really good.

75
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Her talk about the aquatic ape, and the link, of course,

76
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the link between Darwinism

77
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and the fact that we are all naked beneath this --

78
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
we're not hirsute and we can swim rather well.

79
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And she said, you know, she's 90. She's running out of time, she said.

80
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And she's desperate to find more evidence for the link.

81
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And I think, "I'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh."

82
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Laughter)

83
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
This man has swum around the North Pole, what more evidence do you want?

84
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
(Laughter)

85
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And there he is.

86
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
(Applause)

87
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
That's how TED brings these connections together.

88
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I wasn't here on Tuesday. I didn't actually see Gordon Brown's

89
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
job application -- um, sorry.

90
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
(Laughter)

91
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I'm so sorry. (Applause)

92
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I'm so sorry. No, no. (Applause)

93
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
No, no, ahh ... (Applause)

94
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(As Brown): "Global problems require Scottish solutions."

95
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

96
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The problem I have is because Gordon Brown, he comes onstage

97
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and he looks for all the world like a man

98
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
who's just taken the head off a bear suit.

99
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(As Brown): "Hello, can I tell you what happened in the woods back there?

100
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Uh, no." (Laughter)

101
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
"I'm sorry. I've only got 18 minutes, 18 minutes to talk about saving the world,

102
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
saving the planet, global institutions.

103
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Our work on climate change,

104
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I've only got 18 minutes, unfortunately I'm not able to tell you about

105
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
all the wonderful things we're doing to promote the climate change agenda

106
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in Great Britain,

107
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
like the third runway we're planning at Heathrow Airport ..."

108
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Laughter)

109
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
"The large coal-fired power station we're building

110
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
at King's North,

111
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and of course the exciting news that only today,

112
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
only this week, Britain's only manufacturer

113
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
of wind turbines has been forced to close.

114
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
No time, unfortunately,

115
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to mention those."

116
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Applause)

117
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
"British jobs for Scottish people ...

118
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
No." (Laughter)

119
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
"Christian principles, Christian values.

120
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal,

121
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife."

122
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Laughter)

123
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
"Although to be honest, when I was at Number 11 that was never going to be a problem."

124
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

125
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(As Tony Blair): "Yeah, alright, come on, eh.

126
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Alright Gordon, come on, eh.

127
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I just, can I just say a few things about,

128
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
first about Cherie, because she's a wonderful lady,

129
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
my wife, with a wonderful smile.

130
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
That reminds me, I must post that letter."

131
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Laughter)

132
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
"I just think, you know, what people forget,

133
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Gordon and I, we always got on perfectly well.

134
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Alright, it was never exactly 'Brokeback Mountain.'"

135
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
(Laughter)

136
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
"You know, I wrote to him, just before I left office. I said,

137
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
'Can I rely on your support for the next month?'

138
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And he wrote back. He said, 'No, you can't.'

139
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Which kind of surprised me, because I'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before."

140
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Laughter)

141
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Another thing Gordon could have mentioned in his speech

142
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to the Mansion House in 2002 --

143
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that was to the building; the people weren't listening.

144
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But the people, when talking about the finance industry, he said,

145
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
"What you as the city of London have done for financial services,

146
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
we, as a government, hope to do for the economy as a whole."

147
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
(Laughter)

148
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
When you think what's happened to financial services,

149
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and you see what's happened to the economy, you think,

150
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
"Well, there is a man who delivers on his promises."

151
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
(Laughter)

152
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But we're in a new world now. We're in a completely new world.

153
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
This is the first time that I can remember, where if you get a letter

154
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
from the bank manager about a loan, you don't know if you're borrowing

155
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
money from him, or if he's borrowing money from you.

156
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Am I right?

157
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
These extraordinary things, Icelandic Internet accounts.

158
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Did anyone here have an Icelandic Internet account?

159
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Why would you do that? Why would -- It's like one step up

160
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
from replying to one of those emails from Nigeria, isn't it?

161
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
(Laughter)

162
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Asking for your bank details.

163
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And, you know, Iceland, it was never going to cut it.

164
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It didn't have that kind of collateral.

165
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
What does it have? It has fish, that's all.

166
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
That's why the Prime Minister went on television. He said,

167
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
"This has left us all

168
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
with a very big haddock."

169
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
(Laughter)

170
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
A lot of what I do -- I have to try and make sense

171
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
of things before I can make nonsense of them.

172
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And making sense of the financial crisis is very, very difficult.

173
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Luckily, somebody like George Bush was really helpful.

174
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
He summed it up, really, at a dinner.

175
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
He was speaking at a dinner, he said,

176
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
"Wall Street got drunk."

177
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Laughter)

178
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
"And now it's got a hangover."

179
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And that's, you know, that's something --

180
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
(Applause)

181
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And that's something we can relate to.

182
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
It's certainly something he can relate to.

183
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Laughter)

184
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And the other one, of course, is Donald Rumsfeld, who said,

185
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
"There are the known knowns, the things we know we know.

186
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And then you got the known unknowns,

187
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
the things we know we don't know.

188
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And then you got the unknown unknowns, those are the things

189
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
we don't know we don't know."

190
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And being English, when I first heard that I thought, "What a load of cock."

191
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And then, you're now, well, actually, that's what this is about.

192
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
This whole, what Ben Bernanke has said,

193
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
the chaotic unwinding of the world's financial system,

194
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
it's about -- they don't know, they didn't know what they were doing.

195
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
In 2006, the head of the American Mortgage Bankers Association said, quote,

196
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
"As we can clearly see,

197
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
no seismic occurrence

198
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
is about to overwhelm the U.S. economy."

199
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Now, there is a man on top of his job.

200
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
(Laughter)

201
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And when the crisis was happening, the head of quantitative equities

202
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
at Lehman Brothers said,

203
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
"Events which models predicted would happen

204
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
once every 10,000 years

205
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
happened every day for three days."

206
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So, it's extraordinary. It's a new world that's very, very difficult to make sense of.

207
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
But we have a new hope. We have a new man.

208
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
America has now elected its first openly black President.

209
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
(Laughter)

210
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Wonderful news.

211
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Not only that, he's left-handed. Have you noticed this?

212
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
How many people here are left-handed?

213
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
You see, a lot of the people that I most admire,

214
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
they're great artists, great designers, great thinkers,

215
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
they're left-handed.

216
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And somebody said to me last night, you know, being left-handed,

217
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
you have to learn to write without smudging the ink.

218
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And somebody was talking about metaphors on Monday.

219
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And I thought, what a wonderful metaphor, isn't it? An American President who

220
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
has to write without smudging the ink.

221
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
You like that one? As opposed to you could see

222
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
George Bush, well, what's the metaphor there?

223
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing, wouldn't it?

224
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
"Well, you know I'm sorry about that.

225
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I'm right-handed but I seem to have smudged that ink as well."

226
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
(Laughter)

227
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But, you know, he's gone. Now he's gone.

228
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
That's eight years of American History, eight minutes of my act,

229
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
just gone like that.

230
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
"You know, it's the end of an error [sic].

231
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I happen to believe it was a great error.

232
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors

233
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
in the history of the United States.

234
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
But we proved them wrong in Iraq.

235
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
They said there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda.

236
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
There is now."

237
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Laughter)

238
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
"But I have a message for the suicide bombers,

239
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
for those people who've blown themselves up."

240
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
(Laughter)

241
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
"We're going to find you."

242
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
(Laughter)

243
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
"We're going to make sure you don't do it again."

244
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Laughter)

245
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But now he's gone, and it's great to see one of the --

246
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
arguably one of the worst speech makers

247
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
in American history,

248
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
now given way to one of the greatest, in Obama.

249
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
You were there, maybe, on the night of his victory.

250
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And he spoke to the crowd in Chicago, he said,

251
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
"If there is anyone out there

252
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
who still doubts

253
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that America is a place

254
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
where all things are possible ..."

255
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I can't do the whole thing because it would take too long, it really would.

256
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Laughter)

257
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But you get the picture. And then it goes to the inauguration.

258
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And he and the Chief Justice, they trip over each other,

259
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up.

260
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And there is George Bush sitting there going, "Heh heh heh heh ..."

261
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Laughter)

262
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
"Not so easy is it? Heh heh heh."

263
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
(Laughter)

264
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
But the interesting thing is, Gordon Brown was talking about Cicero,

265
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
who said, people would listen to a speech, they said, "Great speech."

266
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And then they'd listen to Demosthenes,

267
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and they'd say, "Let's march."

268
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And we all want to believe in President Obama.

269
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
It's rather like that line in the film "As Good As it Gets."

270
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Do you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson,

271
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson, "What do you see in me?"

272
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And Jack Nicholson just says,

273
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
"You make me want to be a better man."

274
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And you want a leader who inspires and challenges

275
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and makes you want to be a better citizen. Right?

276
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
But at the moment, it's a Cicero thing.

277
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
We like what Barack Obama says, but we don't do anything about it.

278
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So he comes over to this country, and he says,

279
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
"We need

280
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
a big fiscal stimulus."

281
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And everyone goes, "Great!" He leaves the country

282
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and the French and the Germans go, "No, no, forget about that,

283
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
absolutely not." Nothing happens. He goes to Strasburg.

284
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
He says, "We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan."

285
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And everyone goes, "Great idea."

286
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
He leaves, people go, "No no no, we're not going to do that.

287
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
5,000 maximum, and no rockets. No, no, not going to do it."

288
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
He goes to Prague, he says, "We believe in a nuclear-free world."

289
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And it's great to have an American president who can say the word "nuclear,"

290
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
let's just point that out first.

291
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Do you remember that? George Bush, "A nu-ca-ler."

292
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Sorry, what? "A nu-ca-ler."

293
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
(Laughter)

294
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Could you say "avuncular"? "Avunclear."

295
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
(Laughter)

296
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Thank you very much.

297
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
But he says, "We want a nuclear-free world."

298
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And that day, North Korea, that very day,

299
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
North Korea is just seeing if it can

300
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
just get one over Japan --

301
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
(Laughter) --

302
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and land it before ...

303
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So, where do we look for inspiration? We've still got Bill Clinton.

304
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
"Travels the world." (Laughs)

305
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
"I believe, I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said ..."

306
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
(Laughter)

307
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
"Tell a lie; it was Diana Ross ..."

308
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
(Laughter)

309
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
"... who said, reach out and touch ..."

310
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
(Laughter)

311
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
"... somebody's gla -- hand."

312
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
(Laughter)

313
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
"Make this world a better place, if you can.

314
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I just think that's important. I really do.

315
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And I was hoping Hillary would get to the White House,

316
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
because she'd have been out of our home for four years.

317
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And I, you know." (Laughter)

318
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
"So, when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements, let me tell you."

319
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
(Laughter)

320
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
So, there's him. In Britain we have Prince Charles:

321
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
"And the environment is so important, all we can do.

322
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
My wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to

323
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
push emissions up her agenda."

324
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
(Laughter)

325
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Or, any South Africans, we have Mandela to inspire.

326
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Mandela, the great man Mandela.

327
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
He's been honored with a statue now.

328
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
The previous highest honor he had in Britain

329
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
was a visit from the team from Ground Force, a gardening program.

330
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
"So, Nelson, how would you like a nice water feature?"

331
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
"Ahh, listen to me Mr. Titchmarsh."

332
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
(Laughter)

333
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
"I was held in prison

334
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
for nearly 30 years

335
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
on an island

336
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
in the middle of the ocean.

337
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Why would I need a bloody water feature?"

338
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
(Laughter)

339
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Very quickly: I wasn't quite sure how to end this talk

340
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote

341
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
from the "Japanese Essays on Idleness"

342
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
which said it's nice to have something which is unfinished

343
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
because it implies there is still room for growth.

344
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Thank you very much indeed.

345
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
(Applause)

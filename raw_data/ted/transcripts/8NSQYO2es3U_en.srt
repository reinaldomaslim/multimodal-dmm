1
0:00:12.875,000 --> 0:00:14,000
It was about two years after Hurricane Katrina

2
0:00:15.875,000 --> 0:00:17,000
that I first saw the Louisiana flood maps.

3
0:00:19.5,000 --> 0:00:22,000
These flood maps are used to show land loss in the past

4
0:00:23.292,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and land loss that is to come.

5
0:00:25.875,000 --> 0:00:28,000
On this particular day, at a community meeting,

6
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:31,000
these maps were used to explain

7
0:00:31.125,000 --> 0:00:35,000
how a 30-foot tidal surge that accompanied Hurricane Katrina

8
0:00:35.5,000 --> 0:00:38,000
could flood communities like mine in south Louisiana

9
0:00:38.875,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and communities across the Mississippi and Alabama coast.

10
0:00:42.875,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It turns out that the land we were losing was our buffer from the sea.

11
0:00:49.125,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I volunteered to interact with the graphics on the wall,

12
0:00:52.583,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and in an instant my life changed for the second time in two years.

13
0:00:57.333,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The graphic showed massive land loss in south Louisiana

14
0:01:02.083,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and an encroaching sea,

15
0:01:04.208,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but more specifically, the graphic showed the disappearance of my community

16
0:01:10.833,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and many other communities before the end of the century.

17
0:01:15.292,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I wasn't alone at the front of the room.

18
0:01:17.708,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I was standing there with other members of south Louisiana's communities --

19
0:01:22.125,000 --> 0:01:24,000
black, Native, poor.

20
0:01:25.792,000 --> 0:01:29,000
We thought we were just bound by temporary disaster recovery,

21
0:01:30.167,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but we found that we were now bound by the impossible task

22
0:01:34.083,000 --> 0:01:38,000
of ensuring that our communities would not be erased by sea level rise

23
0:01:38.25,000 --> 0:01:39,000
due to climate change.

24
0:01:41.375,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Friends, neighbors, family, my community:

25
0:01:46.333,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I just assumed it would always be there.

26
0:01:49.958,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Land, trees, marsh, bayous:

27
0:01:54.917,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I just assumed that it would be there as it had been for thousands of years.

28
0:01:59.042,000 --> 0:02:,000
I was wrong.

29
0:02:02.25,000 --> 0:02:04,000
To understand what was happening to my community,

30
0:02:04.875,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I had to talk to other communities around the globe.

31
0:02:07.875,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I started in south Louisiana with the United Houma Nation.

32
0:02:11.292,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I talked to youth advocates in Shishmaref, Alaska.

33
0:02:15.208,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I talked to fisherwomen in coastal Vietnam,

34
0:02:18.708,000 --> 0:02:2,000
justice fighters in Fiji,

35
0:02:21.25,000 --> 0:02:23,000
new generations of leaders

36
0:02:23.458,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in the ancient cultures of the Torres Straits.

37
0:02:26.667,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Communities that had been here for thousands of years

38
0:02:30.792,000 --> 0:02:31,000
were suffering the same fate,

39
0:02:32.667,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and we were all contemplating how we would survive the next 50.

40
0:02:38.625,000 --> 0:02:4,000
By the end of the next century,

41
0:02:41.333,000 --> 0:02:43,000
it's predicted that more than 180 million people

42
0:02:44.083,000 --> 0:02:46,000
will be displaced due to climate change,

43
0:02:46.5,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and in south Louisiana,

44
0:02:48.208,000 --> 0:02:51,000
those who can afford to do so are already moving.

45
0:02:51.875,000 --> 0:02:53,000
They're moving because south Louisiana is losing land

46
0:02:54.875,000 --> 0:02:56,000
at one of the fastest rates on the planet.

47
0:02:58.25,000 --> 0:03:,000
Disappearance is what my bayou community

48
0:03:01.083,000 --> 0:03:03,000
has in common with other coastal communities.

49
0:03:04.708,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Erasure is what communities around the globe are fighting

50
0:03:08.792,000 --> 0:03:1,000
as we get real about the impacts of climate change.

51
0:03:13.208,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I've spent the last 14 years advocating on behalf of communities

52
0:03:16.542,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that have been directly impacted by the climate crisis.

53
0:03:19.625,000 --> 0:03:21,000
These communities are fighting discrimination

54
0:03:21.958,000 --> 0:03:23,000
within climate disaster recovery,

55
0:03:24.833,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and they're also trying to balance mass displacement of people

56
0:03:28.792,000 --> 0:03:29,000
with an influx of others

57
0:03:30.625,000 --> 0:03:32,000
who see opportunity in starting anew.

58
0:03:34.25,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Since 2005, people have been called "refugees"

59
0:03:39.292,000 --> 0:03:42,000
when they leave when they're displaced by climate disaster,

60
0:03:42.5,000 --> 0:03:46,000
even when they don't cross international borders.

61
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:49,000
These terms, these misused terms,

62
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that are meant to identify the other,

63
0:03:52.958,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the victim,

64
0:03:55.375,000 --> 0:03:57,000
the person who is not supposed to be here,

65
0:03:57.958,000 --> 0:03:58,000
these terms are barriers

66
0:03:59.958,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to economic recovery,

67
0:04:02.25,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to social integration

68
0:04:04.292,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and to the healing required from the climate crisis and climate trauma.

69
0:04:09.542,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Words matter.

70
0:04:11.375,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It also matters how we treat people who are crossing borders.

71
0:04:15.125,000 --> 0:04:18,000
We should care about how people who are crossing borders today

72
0:04:19.125,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to seek refuge and safety are being treated,

73
0:04:21.958,000 --> 0:04:25,000
if for no other reason than it might be you or someone you love

74
0:04:26.292,000 --> 0:04:29,000
who needs to exercise their human right to migrate

75
0:04:29.958,000 --> 0:04:3,000
in the nearby future.

76
0:04:32.25,000 --> 0:04:35,000
We must start preparing for global migration today.

77
0:04:35.833,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It's a reality now.

78
0:04:38.917,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Our cities and our communities are not prepared.

79
0:04:41.708,000 --> 0:04:44,000
In fact, our economic system and our social systems

80
0:04:44.875,000 --> 0:04:48,000
are only prepared to make profit off of people who migrate.

81
0:04:49.208,000 --> 0:04:54,000
This will cause rounds of climate gentrification,

82
0:04:54.75,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and it will also penalize the movement of people,

83
0:04:58.583,000 --> 0:05:,000
usually through exploited labor

84
0:05:00.917,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and usually through criminalization.

85
0:05:04.542,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Climate gentrification that happens in anticipation of sea level rise

86
0:05:08.417,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is what we're seeing in places like Miami,

87
0:05:11.125,000 --> 0:05:14,000
where communities that were kept from the waterfront

88
0:05:14.25,000 --> 0:05:17,000
are now being priced out of the high ground

89
0:05:17.917,000 --> 0:05:18,000
where they were placed originally

90
0:05:19.708,000 --> 0:05:21,000
as people move away from the coast.

91
0:05:22.042,000 --> 0:05:24,000
These folks are being moved, forced to relocate away

92
0:05:24.667,000 --> 0:05:27,000
from the social and economic systems that they need to survive.

93
0:05:29.333,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Climate gentrification also happens in the aftermath of climate disaster.

94
0:05:35.542,000 --> 0:05:37,000
When massive amounts of people leave a location

95
0:05:38.083,000 --> 0:05:4,000
for an indefinite amount of time,

96
0:05:40.292,000 --> 0:05:42,000
we see others come in.

97
0:05:42.625,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We also see climate gentrification happen

98
0:05:45.208,000 --> 0:05:49,000
when damaged homes are now "green built,"

99
0:05:49.667,000 --> 0:05:5,000
but now have a higher value,

100
0:05:51.667,000 --> 0:05:54,000
generally outside of the reach of black and brown and poor people

101
0:05:55.208,000 --> 0:05:56,000
who want to return home.

102
0:05:57.667,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The price difference in rents or the ownership of a house

103
0:06:01.833,000 --> 0:06:04,000
is the difference between being able to practice your right,

104
0:06:05.75,000 --> 0:06:08,000
your human right to return home as a community,

105
0:06:09.125,000 --> 0:06:12,000
or be forced to resettle somewhere else

106
0:06:12.167,000 --> 0:06:13,000
less climate resilient,

107
0:06:13.667,000 --> 0:06:14,000
less expensive

108
0:06:15.125,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and alone.

109
0:06:17.458,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The climate crisis is a much larger conversation

110
0:06:20.75,000 --> 0:06:22,000
than reducing CO2 emissions,

111
0:06:23.125,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and it is a much different conversation than just extreme weather.

112
0:06:27.292,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We're facing a shift in every aspect of our global reality.

113
0:06:32.292,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And climate migration is just one small part,

114
0:06:35.417,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but it's going to have ripple effects

115
0:06:37.5,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in both coastal cities and cities in the interior.

116
0:06:41.458,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So what do we do?

117
0:06:43.042,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I have a few ideas.

118
0:06:44.417,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Laughter)

119
0:06:46.208,000 --> 0:06:5,000
First, we must reframe our understanding of the problem.

120
0:06:50.917,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Climate change is not the problem.

121
0:06:53.792,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Climate change is the most horrible symptom

122
0:06:57.583,000 --> 0:06:59,000
of an economic system

123
0:06:59.708,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that has been built for a few

124
0:07:02.125,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to extract every precious value out of this planet and its people,

125
0:07:07.708,000 --> 0:07:08,000
from our natural resources

126
0:07:09.5,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to the fruits of our human labor.

127
0:07:11.75,000 --> 0:07:13,000
This system has created this crisis.

128
0:07:14.708,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Applause)

129
0:07:20.25,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We must have the courage to admit we've taken too much.

130
0:07:24.333,000 --> 0:07:26,000
We cannot close our eyes to the fact

131
0:07:27.208,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that the entire world is paying a price

132
0:07:30.375,000 --> 0:07:36,000
for the privilege and comfort of just a few people on the planet.

133
0:07:37.333,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It's time for us to make society-wide changes

134
0:07:41.25,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to a system that incentivizes consumption

135
0:07:44.5,000 --> 0:07:46,000
to the point of global imbalance.

136
0:07:47.458,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Our social, political and economic systems of extraction

137
0:07:51.875,000 --> 0:07:55,000
must be transformed into systems that regenerate the earth

138
0:07:56.292,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and advance human liberty globally.

139
0:08:00.042,000 --> 0:08:03,000
It is arrogance to think that technology will save us.

140
0:08:04.625,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It is ego to think that we can continue

141
0:08:08.458,000 --> 0:08:11,000
this unjust and extractive approach to living on this planet

142
0:08:12.167,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and survive.

143
0:08:14.458,000 --> 0:08:19,000
(Applause)

144
0:08:19.792,000 --> 0:08:21,000
To survive this next phase of our human existence,

145
0:08:22.75,000 --> 0:08:25,000
we will need to restructure our social and economic systems

146
0:08:26.042,000 --> 0:08:28,000
to develop our collective resilience.

147
0:08:28.75,000 --> 0:08:33,000
The social restructuring must be towards restoration and repair

148
0:08:34.333,000 --> 0:08:35,000
of the earth

149
0:08:35.792,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and the communities that have been extracted from,

150
0:08:38.667,000 --> 0:08:39,000
criminalized

151
0:08:39.958,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and targeted for generations.

152
0:08:42.917,000 --> 0:08:43,000
These are the frontlines.

153
0:08:44.75,000 --> 0:08:46,000
This is where we start.

154
0:08:47.5,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We must establish a new social attitude to see migration as a benefit,

155
0:08:52.375,000 --> 0:08:54,000
a necessity for our global survival,

156
0:08:55.25,000 --> 0:08:57,000
not as a threat to our individual privilege.

157
0:08:58.958,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Collective resilience means developing cities that can receive people

158
0:09:03.208,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and provide housing,

159
0:09:04.917,000 --> 0:09:06,000
food, water, health care

160
0:09:07.833,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and the freedom from overpolicing

161
0:09:09.875,000 --> 0:09:1,000
for everyone,

162
0:09:11.167,000 --> 0:09:12,000
no matter who they are,

163
0:09:12.542,000 --> 0:09:13,000
no matter where they're from.

164
0:09:15.583,000 --> 0:09:19,000
What would it mean if we started to plan for climate migration now?

165
0:09:20.667,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Sprawling cities or declining cities could see this as an opportunity

166
0:09:24.917,000 --> 0:09:28,000
to rebuild a social infrastructure rooted in justice and fairness.

167
0:09:29.875,000 --> 0:09:31,000
We could actually put money into public hospitals

168
0:09:32.625,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and help them prepare

169
0:09:34.125,000 --> 0:09:36,000
for what is to come through climate migration,

170
0:09:36.375,000 --> 0:09:39,000
including the trauma that comes with loss and relocation.

171
0:09:40.75,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We can invest more of our time in justice,

172
0:09:44.083,000 --> 0:09:46,000
but it cannot be for temporary gain,

173
0:09:46.708,000 --> 0:09:48,000
it cannot be to help budget shortfalls,

174
0:09:49.167,000 --> 0:09:51,000
it has to be for long-term change

175
0:09:51.333,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and it has to be to advance justice.

176
0:09:53.917,000 --> 0:09:55,000
It's already possible, y'all.

177
0:09:56.208,000 --> 0:09:57,000
After Hurricane Katrina,

178
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:01,000
universities and high schools around the US took in students

179
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:06,000
to help them finish their semester or their year without missing a beat.

180
0:10:06.167,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Those students are now productive assets in our community,

181
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and this is what our communities, our businesses and our institutions

182
0:10:13.458,000 --> 0:10:14,000
need to get ready for now.

183
0:10:15.042,000 --> 0:10:16,000
The time is now.

184
0:10:18.083,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So as we reframe the problem in a more truthful way

185
0:10:21.875,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and we restructure our social systems in a more just way,

186
0:10:26.375,000 --> 0:10:3,000
all that will be left is for us to reindigenize ourselves

187
0:10:30.417,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and to conjure a power of the most ancient kind.

188
0:10:34.5,000 --> 0:10:38,000
This necessarily means that we must learn to follow --

189
0:10:38.75,000 --> 0:10:42,000
not tokenize, not exotify, not dismiss --

190
0:10:43.583,000 --> 0:10:45,000
the leadership and the traditional knowledge

191
0:10:46.042,000 --> 0:10:48,000
of a particular local place.

192
0:10:49.042,000 --> 0:10:52,000
It means that we must commit to standards of ecological equity

193
0:10:52.792,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and climate justice and human rights

194
0:10:55.542,000 --> 0:10:57,000
as the basis, a base standard,

195
0:10:57.792,000 --> 0:10:58,000
a starting point,

196
0:10:59.167,000 --> 0:11:,000
for where our new society is to go.

197
0:11:02.25,000 --> 0:11:07,000
All of this requires us to recognize a power greater than ourselves

198
0:11:07.625,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and a life longer than the ones we will live.

199
0:11:10.958,000 --> 0:11:14,000
It requires us to believe in the things that we are privileged enough

200
0:11:15.375,000 --> 0:11:16,000
not to have to see.

201
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:21,000
We must honor the rights of nature.

202
0:11:21.167,000 --> 0:11:24,000
We must advance human rights for all.

203
0:11:24.625,000 --> 0:11:26,000
We must transform from a disposable,

204
0:11:27.583,000 --> 0:11:29,000
individual society

205
0:11:30.292,000 --> 0:11:33,000
into one that sees our collective, long-term humanity,

206
0:11:34.167,000 --> 0:11:35,000
or else we will not make it.

207
0:11:37.125,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We must see that even the best of us are entangled in an unjust system,

208
0:11:42.958,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and we must acknowledge

209
0:11:45.125,000 --> 0:11:47,000
that the only way you're going to survive

210
0:11:47.75,000 --> 0:11:5,000
is for us to figure out

211
0:11:50.792,000 --> 0:11:52,000
how to reach a shared liberation together.

212
0:11:54.625,000 --> 0:11:55,000
The good news is

213
0:11:56.125,000 --> 0:11:58,000
we come from powerful people.

214
0:11:58.5,000 --> 0:12:,000
We come from those who have, in one way or another,

215
0:12:01.292,000 --> 0:12:04,000
survived so far to be us here today.

216
0:12:04.917,000 --> 0:12:06,000
This is reason enough to fight.

217
0:12:07.333,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And take it from your south Louisiana friend,

218
0:12:09.875,000 --> 0:12:12,000
those hardest fights are the ones to celebrate.

219
0:12:13.125,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Let's choose to make this next phase of our planetary existence beautiful,

220
0:12:18.042,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and while we're at it,

221
0:12:19.333,000 --> 0:12:21,000
let's make it just and fair for everyone.

222
0:12:23.042,000 --> 0:12:24,000
We can do this, y'all.

223
0:12:24.917,000 --> 0:12:25,000
We can do this,

224
0:12:26.208,000 --> 0:12:27,000
because we must.

225
0:12:27.833,000 --> 0:12:29,000
We must, or else we lose our planet

226
0:12:30.833,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and we lose ourselves.

227
0:12:32.708,000 --> 0:12:33,000
The work starts here.

228
0:12:34.375,000 --> 0:12:36,000
The work starts together.

229
0:12:36.458,000 --> 0:12:37,000
This is my offering.

230
0:12:37.917,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Thank you for receiving it. Merci.

231
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:43,000
(Applause)

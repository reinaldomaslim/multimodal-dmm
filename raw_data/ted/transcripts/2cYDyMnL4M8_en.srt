1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Let me talk about India

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
through the evolution of ideas.

3
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Now I believe this is an interesting way of looking at it

4
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
because in every society, especially an open democratic society,

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
it's only when ideas take root that things change.

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Slowly ideas lead to ideology,

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
lead to policies that lead to actions.

8
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
In 1930 this country went through a Great Depression,

9
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
which led to all the ideas of the state and social security,

10
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and all the other things that happened in Roosevelt's time.

11
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
In the 1980s we had the Reagan revolution, which lead to deregulation.

12
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And today, after the global economic crisis,

13
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
there was a whole new set of rules

14
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
about how the state should intervene.

15
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So ideas change states.

16
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And I looked at India and said,

17
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
really there are four kinds of ideas

18
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
which really make an impact on India.

19
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
The first, to my mind,

20
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
is what I call as "the ideas that have arrived."

21
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
These ideas have brought together something

22
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
which has made India happen the way it is today.

23
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
The second set of ideas I call "ideas in progress."

24
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Those are ideas which have been accepted

25
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
but not implemented yet.

26
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
The third set of ideas are what I call as

27
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
"ideas that we argue about" --

28
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
those are ideas where we have a fight,

29
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
an ideological battle about how to do things.

30
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And the fourth thing, which I believe is most important, is

31
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
"the ideas that we need to anticipate."

32
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Because when you are a developing country

33
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having,

34
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
you can actually anticipate

35
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
what that did and do things very differently.

36
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Now in India's case I believe there are six ideas

37
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
which are responsible for where it has come today.

38
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The first is really the notion of people.

39
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
In the '60s and '70s

40
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
we thought of people as a burden.

41
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We thought of people as a liability.

42
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Today we talk of people as an asset.

43
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
We talk of people as human capital.

44
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And I believe this change in the mindset,

45
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
of looking at people as something of a burden

46
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to human capital,

47
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
has been one of the fundamental changes in the Indian mindset.

48
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And this change in thinking of human capital

49
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
is linked to the fact

50
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that India is going through a demographic dividend.

51
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
As healthcare improves,

52
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
as infant mortality goes down,

53
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
fertility rates start dropping. And India is experiencing that.

54
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
India is going to have

55
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
a lot of young people with a demographic dividend

56
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
for the next 30 years.

57
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
What is unique about this demographic dividend

58
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
is that India will be the only country in the world

59
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to have this demographic dividend.

60
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
In other words, it will be the only young country in an aging world.

61
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And this is very important. At the same time

62
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
if you peel away the demographic dividend in India,

63
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
there are actually two demographic curves.

64
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
One is in the south and in the west of India,

65
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
which is already going to be fully expensed by 2015,

66
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
because in that part of the country, the fertility rate is

67
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
almost equal to that of a West European country.

68
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Then there is the whole northern India,

69
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend.

70
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But a demographic dividend is only as good

71
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
as the investment in your human capital.

72
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Only if the people have education,

73
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
they have good health, they have infrastructure,

74
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
they have roads to go to work, they have lights to study at night --

75
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
only in those cases can you really get the benefit

76
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
of a demographic dividend.

77
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
In other words, if you don't really invest in the human capital,

78
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the same demographic dividend

79
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
can be a demographic disaster.

80
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Therefore India is at a critical point

81
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
where either it can leverage its demographic dividend

82
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
or it can lead to a demographic disaster.

83
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The second thing in India has been the change in

84
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
the role of entrepreneurs.

85
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
When India got independence entrepreneurs were seen

86
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
as a bad lot, as people who would exploit.

87
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But today, after 60 years, because of the rise of entrepreneurship,

88
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
entrepreneurs have become role models,

89
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
and they are contributing hugely to the society.

90
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
This change has contributed

91
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to the vitality and the whole economy.

92
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The third big thing I believe that has changed India

93
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
is our attitude towards the English language.

94
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
English language was seen as a language of the imperialists.

95
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But today, with globalization,

96
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
with outsourcing, English has become a language of aspiration.

97
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
This has made it something that everybody wants to learn.

98
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And the fact that we have English is now becoming

99
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
a huge strategic asset.

100
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
The next thing is technology.

101
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Forty years back, computers were seen

102
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
as something which was forbidding, something which was intimidating,

103
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
something that reduced jobs.

104
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Today we live in a country

105
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
which sells eight million mobile phones a month,

106
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
of which 90 percent of those mobile phones

107
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
are prepaid phones

108
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
because people don't have credit history.

109
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Forty percent of those prepaid phones

110
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
are recharged at less than 20 cents at each recharge.

111
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
That is the scale at which

112
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
technology has liberated and made it accessible.

113
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And therefore technology has gone

114
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
from being seen as something forbidding

115
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and intimidating to something that is empowering.

116
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Twenty years back,

117
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
when there was a report on bank computerization,

118
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
they didn't name the report as

119
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
a report on computers,

120
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
they call them as "ledger posting machines."

121
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
They didn't want the unions to believe that they were actually computers.

122
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And when they wanted to have more advanced, more powerful computers

123
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
they called them "advanced ledger posting machines."

124
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So we have come a long way from those days

125
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
where the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment,

126
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and really has changed the way Indians think of technology.

127
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And then I think the other point

128
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
is that Indians today are far more

129
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
comfortable with globalization.

130
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Again, after having lived for more than 200 years

131
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
under the East India Company and under imperial rule,

132
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization

133
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
believing it was a form of imperialism.

134
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
But today, as Indian companies go abroad,

135
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
as Indians come and work all over the world,

136
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Indians have gained a lot more confidence

137
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and have realized that globalization is something they can participate in.

138
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And the fact that the demographics are in our favor,

139
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
because we are the only young country in an aging world,

140
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
makes globalization all the more attractive to Indians.

141
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And finally, India has had

142
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the deepening of its democracy.

143
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
When democracy came to India 60 years back

144
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
it was an elite concept.

145
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy

146
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
because they wanted to bring in the idea of

147
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth.

148
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But today democracy has become a bottom-up process

149
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
where everybody has realized

150
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
the benefits of having a voice,

151
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
the benefits of being in an open society.

152
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And therefore democracy has become embedded.

153
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I believe these six factors --

154
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
the rise of the notion of population as human capital,

155
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
the rise of Indian entrepreneurs,

156
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
the rise of English as a language of aspiration,

157
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
technology as something empowering,

158
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
globalization as a positive factor,

159
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and the deepening of democracy -- has contributed

160
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to why India is today growing

161
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
at rates it has never seen before.

162
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
But having said that,

163
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
then we come to what I call as ideas in progress.

164
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society,

165
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
but you are not able to implement those things.

166
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And really there are four things here.

167
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
One is the question of education.

168
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
For some reason, whatever reason -- lack of money,

169
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
lack of priorities, because of religion having an older culture --

170
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
primary education was never given the focus it required.

171
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But now I believe it's reached a point

172
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
where it has become very important.

173
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Unfortunately the government schools don't function,

174
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
so children are going to private schools today.

175
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Even in the slums of India

176
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
more than 50 percent of urban kids are going into private schools.

177
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work.

178
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But having said that, there is an enormous desire

179
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
among everybody, including the poor, to educate their children.

180
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So I believe primary education is an idea

181
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
which is arrived but not yet implemented.

182
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Similarly, infrastructure --

183
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
for a long time, infrastructure was not a priority.

184
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Those of you who have been to India have seen that.

185
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
It's certainly not like China.

186
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But today I believe finally infrastructure is something

187
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
which is agreed upon and which people want to implement.

188
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
It is reflected in the political statements.

189
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
20 years back the political slogan was, "Roti, kapada, makaan,"

190
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
which meant, "Food, clothing and shelter."

191
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And today's political slogan is, "Bijli, sadak, pani,"

192
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
which means "Electricity, water and roads."

193
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And that is a change in the mindset

194
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
where infrastructure is now accepted.

195
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So I do believe this is an idea which has arrived,

196
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
but simply not implemented.

197
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
The third thing is again cities.

198
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
It's because Gandhi believed in villages

199
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and because the British ruled from the cities,

200
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
therefore Nehru thought of New Delhi as an un-Indian city.

201
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
For a long time we have neglected our cities.

202
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see.

203
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
But today, finally, after economic reforms,

204
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and economic growth,

205
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I think the notion that cities are engines

206
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
of economic growth,

207
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
cities are engines of creativity,

208
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
cities are engines of innovation,

209
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
have finally been accepted.

210
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And I think now you're seeing the move towards improving our cities.

211
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Again, an idea which is arrived, but not yet implemented.

212
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
The final thing is the notion of India as a single market --

213
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
because when you didn't think of India as a market,

214
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
you didn't really bother about a single market, because it didn't really matter.

215
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And therefore you had a situation

216
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
where every state had its own market for products.

217
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Every province had its own market for agriculture.

218
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Increasingly now the policies of

219
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
taxation and infrastructure and all that,

220
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
are moving towards creating India as a single market.

221
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So there is a form of internal globalization which is happening,

222
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
which is as important as external globalization.

223
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
These four factors I believe --

224
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
the ones of primary education,

225
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
infrastructure, urbanization, and single market --

226
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
in my view are ideas in India

227
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
which have been accepted, but not implemented.

228
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Then we have what I believe are the ideas in conflict.

229
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
The ideas that we argue about.

230
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
These are the arguments we have which cause gridlock.

231
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
What are those ideas? One is, I think, are ideological issues.

232
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Because of the historical Indian background, in the caste system,

233
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and because of the fact that there have been many people

234
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
who have been left out in the cold,

235
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
a lot of the politics is about how to make sure

236
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that we'll address that.

237
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And it leads to reservations and other techniques.

238
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
It's also related to the way that we subsidize our people,

239
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and all the left and right arguments that we have.

240
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
A lot of the Indian problems are related to the ideology

241
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
of caste and other things.

242
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
This policy is causing gridlock.

243
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
This is one of the factors which needs to be resolved.

244
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
The second one is the labor policies that we have,

245
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
which make it so difficult for

246
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
entrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies,

247
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that 93 percent of Indian labor

248
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
is in the unorganized sector.

249
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
They have no benefits: they don't have social security;

250
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
they don't have pension; they don't have healthcare; none of those things.

251
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
This needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people

252
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
into the formal workforce,

253
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised.

254
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws,

255
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
which are not as onerous as they are today.

256
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
At the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector,

257
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for.

258
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
The third thing is our higher education.

259
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Indian higher education is completely regulated.

260
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It's very difficult to start a private university.

261
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
It's very difficult for a foreign university to come to India.

262
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
As a result of that our higher education

263
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
is simply not keeping pace with India's demands.

264
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
That is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address.

265
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
But most important I believe

266
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
are the ideas we need to anticipate.

267
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Here India can look at what is happening in the west

268
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and elsewhere, and look at what needs to be done.

269
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
The first thing is, we're very fortunate

270
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that technology is at a point

271
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
where it is much more advanced

272
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
than when other countries had the development.

273
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So we can use technology for governance.

274
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
We can use technology for direct benefits.

275
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
We can use technology for transparency, and many other things.

276
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
The second thing is, the health issue.

277
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
India has equally horrible

278
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
health problems of the higher state of cardiac issue,

279
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
the higher state of diabetes, the higher state of obesity.

280
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases

281
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
with a set of rich country diseases.

282
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Therefore we're to rethink the whole way we look at health.

283
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
We really need to put in place a strategy

284
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
so that we don't go to the other extreme of health.

285
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Similarly today in the West

286
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
you're seeing the problem of entitlement --

287
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
the cost of social security, the cost of Medicare, the cost of Medicaid.

288
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Therefore when you are a young country,

289
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
again you have a chance to put in place a modern pension system

290
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
so that you don't create entitlement problems as you grow old.

291
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And then again, India does not have the luxury

292
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
of making its environment dirty,

293
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
because it has to marry environment and development.

294
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Just to give an idea, the world has to stabilize

295
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
at something like 20 gigatons per year.

296
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
On a population of nine billion

297
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
our average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year.

298
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
India is already at two tons per year.

299
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
But if India grows at something like eight percent,

300
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
income per year per person will go to 16 times by 2050.

301
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
So we're saying: income growing at 16 times and no growth in carbon.

302
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment,

303
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
the way we look at energy,

304
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
the way we create whole new paradigms of development.

305
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Now why does this matter to you?

306
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Why does what's happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you?

307
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Number one, this matters because

308
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
this represents more than a billion people.

309
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
A billion people, 1/6th of the world population.

310
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
It matters because this is a democracy.

311
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And it is important to prove

312
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
that growth and democracy are not incompatible,

313
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
that you can have a democracy, that you can have an open society,

314
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and you can have growth.

315
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
It's important because if you solve these problems,

316
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
you can solve the problems of poverty in the world.

317
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
It's important because

318
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
you need it to solve the world's environment problems.

319
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
If we really want to come to a point,

320
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission,

321
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
we want to really lower the use of energy --

322
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
it has to be solved in countries like India.

323
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
You know if you look at the development

324
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
in the West over 200 years,

325
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
the average growth may have been about two percent.

326
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Here we are talking about countries growing at eight to nine percent.

327
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And that makes a huge difference.

328
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
When India was growing at about three, 3.5 percent

329
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and the population was growing at two percent,

330
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
its per capita income was doubling every 45 years.

331
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
When the economic growth goes to eight percent

332
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and population growth drops to 1.5 percent,

333
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
then per capita income is doubling every nine years.

334
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
In other words, you're certainly fast-forwarding this whole process

335
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
of a billion people going to prosperity.

336
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And you must have a clear strategy

337
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
which is important for India and important for the world.

338
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
That is why I think all of you

339
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
should be equally concerned with it as I am.

340
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Thank you very much.

341
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000

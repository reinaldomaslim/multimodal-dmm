Tyler Edmonds,

2
0:00:16.102,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Bobby Johnson,

3
0:00:18.291,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Davontae Sanford,

4
0:00:20.592,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Marty Tankleff,

5
0:00:22.602,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Jeffrey Deskovic,

6
0:00:24.847,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Anthony Caravella

7
0:00:27.174,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and Travis Hayes.

8
0:00:29.165,000 --> 0:00:31,000
You probably don't recognize their faces.

9
0:00:32.01,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Together, they served 89 years for murders that they didn't commit;

10
0:00:36.658,000 --> 0:00:4,000
murders that they falsely confessed to committing when they were teenagers.

11
0:00:41.763,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I'm a forensic developmental psychologist,

12
0:00:43.798,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and I study these types of cases.

13
0:00:46.663,000 --> 0:00:47,000
As a researcher,

14
0:00:48.277,000 --> 0:00:49,000
a professor

15
0:00:49.472,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and a new parent,

16
0:00:50.805,000 --> 0:00:54,000
my goal is to conduct scientific research that helps us understand

17
0:00:55.726,000 --> 0:00:58,000
how kids function in a legal system that was designed for adults.

18
0:00:59.302,000 --> 0:01:,000
In March of 2006,

19
0:01:01.27,000 --> 0:01:03,000
police interrogated Brendan Dassey,

20
0:01:03.587,000 --> 0:01:06,000
a 16-year-old high school student with an IQ around 70,

21
0:01:07.531,000 --> 0:01:09,000
putting him in the range of intellectual disability.

22
0:01:10.927,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So here's just a brief snippet of his four-hour interrogation.

23
0:01:15.104,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Video) Police 1: Brendan, be honest.

24
0:01:16.948,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I told you before that's the only thing that's going to help you here.

25
0:01:20.308,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We already know what happened, OK?

26
0:01:22.082,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Police 2: If we don't get honesty here --

27
0:01:24.65,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I'm your friend right now,

28
0:01:27.676,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but I've got to believe in you,

29
0:01:29.713,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and if I don't believe in you,

30
0:01:31.208,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I can't go to bat for you.

31
0:01:33.587,000 --> 0:01:34,000
OK? You're nodding.

32
0:01:35.074,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Tell us what happened.

33
0:01:36.317,000 --> 0:01:38,000
P1: Your mom said you'd be honest with us.

34
0:01:38.687,000 --> 0:01:41,000
P2: And she's behind you 100 percent no matter what happens here.

35
0:01:41.794,000 --> 0:01:44,000
P1: That's what she said, because she thinks you know more, too.

36
0:01:44.83,000 --> 0:01:45,000
P2: We're in your corner.

37
0:01:46.853,000 --> 0:01:5,000
P1: We already know what happened, now tell us exactly. Don't lie.

38
0:01:51.843,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Lindsay Malloy: They told Brendan that honesty would "set him free,"

39
0:01:55.117,000 --> 0:01:57,000
but they were completely convinced of his guilt at that point.

40
0:01:58.048,000 --> 0:02:,000
So by honesty, they meant a confession,

41
0:02:00.437,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and his confession would definitely not end up setting him free.

42
0:02:04.588,000 --> 0:02:06,000
They eventually got a confession from Brendan

43
0:02:06.771,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that didn't really make sense,

44
0:02:08.376,000 --> 0:02:1,000
didn't match much of the physical evidence of the crime

45
0:02:10.994,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and is widely believed to be false.

46
0:02:13.439,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Still, it was enough to convict Brendan and sentence him to life in prison

47
0:02:17.477,000 --> 0:02:19,000
for murder and sexual assault in 2007.

48
0:02:21.067,000 --> 0:02:23,000
There was no physical evidence against Brendan at all.

49
0:02:23.646,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It was nothing more than his own words

50
0:02:26.132,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that sent him to prison for nearly a decade,

51
0:02:28.861,000 --> 0:02:3,000
until a judge overturned his conviction just a few months ago.

52
0:02:33.484,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The Dassey case is unique because it made its way into a Netflix series,

53
0:02:38.097,000 --> 0:02:39,000
called "Making a Murderer,"

54
0:02:39.485,000 --> 0:02:4,000
which I'm sure many of you saw,

55
0:02:41.45,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and if you haven't, you should definitely watch it.

56
0:02:44.754,000 --> 0:02:45,000
The Dassey case is also unique

57
0:02:46.47,000 --> 0:02:48,000
because it led to such intense public outrage.

58
0:02:49.404,000 --> 0:02:52,000
People were very angry about how Brendan was questioned,

59
0:02:52.433,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and many assumed that his interrogation had to have been illegal.

60
0:02:57.134,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It wasn't illegal.

61
0:02:58.524,000 --> 0:03:,000
As someone who's a researcher in this area

62
0:03:00.646,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and is familiar with police interrogation training manuals,

63
0:03:03.511,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I wasn't really surprised by what I saw.

64
0:03:06.159,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The fact is, Dassey's interrogation itself is actually not all that unique,

65
0:03:10.693,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and to be honest with you, I've seen worse.

66
0:03:13.475,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So I understand the public outcry about injustice

67
0:03:17.423,000 --> 0:03:19,000
in Brendan Dassey's individual case.

68
0:03:20.058,000 --> 0:03:24,000
But let's not forget that approximately one million or so of his peers

69
0:03:24.617,000 --> 0:03:26,000
are arrested every year in the United States

70
0:03:26.944,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and may be subjected to similar interrogation techniques,

71
0:03:30.435,000 --> 0:03:33,000
techniques that we know increase the risk for false confession.

72
0:03:35.21,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And I know many people are going to struggle with that term,

73
0:03:38.132,000 --> 0:03:39,000
"false confession,"

74
0:03:39.339,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and with believing that false confessions actually occur.

75
0:03:43.084,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And I get that.

76
0:03:44.277,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It's very shocking and counterintuitive:

77
0:03:47.836,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Why would someone confess and even give gruesome details

78
0:03:52.789,000 --> 0:03:55,000
about a horrifying crime like rape or murder

79
0:03:56.089,000 --> 0:03:57,000
if they hadn't actually done it?

80
0:03:58.004,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It makes no sense.

81
0:04:00.393,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And the fact is, we can never know precisely

82
0:04:02.54,000 --> 0:04:03,000
how often false confessions occur.

83
0:04:04.982,000 --> 0:04:07,000
But what we do know is that false confessions or admissions were present

84
0:04:08.949,000 --> 0:04:11,000
in approximately 25 percent of wrongful convictions

85
0:04:12.284,000 --> 0:04:15,000
of people later exonerated by DNA evidence.

86
0:04:15.321,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Turns out, they were innocent.

87
0:04:17.634,000 --> 0:04:2,000
These cases are crystal clear because we have the DNA.

88
0:04:20.851,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So they didn't do the crime,

89
0:04:22.925,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and yet one-quarter of them confessed to it anyway.

90
0:04:27.424,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And at this point, from countless research studies,

91
0:04:30.054,000 --> 0:04:33,000
we have a pretty good sense of why people falsely confess,

92
0:04:33.404,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and why some people,

93
0:04:34.882,000 --> 0:04:35,000
like Brendan Dassey,

94
0:04:36.507,000 --> 0:04:38,000
are at greater risk for doing so.

95
0:04:40.077,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We know that youth are especially vulnerable to providing false confessions.

96
0:04:45.69,000 --> 0:04:47,000
In one study of exonerations, for example,

97
0:04:48.352,000 --> 0:04:5,000
only eight percent of adults had falsely confessed,

98
0:04:50.77,000 --> 0:04:52,000
but 42 percent of juveniles had done so.

99
0:04:53.745,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Of course, if we're just looking at wrongful convictions and exonerations,

100
0:04:58.217,000 --> 0:04:59,000
we're only getting part of the story.

101
0:05:00.663,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Left out, for instance, are the many cases that are resolved by guilty pleas,

102
0:05:05.212,000 --> 0:05:06,000
not trials.

103
0:05:06.939,000 --> 0:05:07,000
From TV and news headlines,

104
0:05:08.709,000 --> 0:05:11,000
you may think that trials are the norm in our legal system,

105
0:05:11.829,000 --> 0:05:14,000
but the reality is that 97 percent of legal cases in the US

106
0:05:15.439,000 --> 0:05:17,000
are resolved by pleas, not trials.

107
0:05:18.396,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Ninety-seven percent.

108
0:05:20.911,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Also left out will be confessions to more minor types of crimes

109
0:05:24.702,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that don't typically involve DNA evidence

110
0:05:26.95,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and aren't usually reviewed or appealed following a conviction.

111
0:05:31.087,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So for this reason,

112
0:05:32.3,000 --> 0:05:35,000
many refer to the false confessions we actually do know about

113
0:05:35.53,000 --> 0:05:37,000
as the tip of a much larger iceberg.

114
0:05:39.492,000 --> 0:05:43,000
In our research, we found alarming rates of false confession among teenagers.

115
0:05:43.942,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We interviewed almost 200 incarcerated 14-to-17-year-olds,

116
0:05:48.043,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and 17 percent of them reported

117
0:05:49.843,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that they'd made at least one false confession to police.

118
0:05:54.427,000 --> 0:05:56,000
What's also shocking to most is that,

119
0:05:57.41,000 --> 0:05:58,000
in interrogations in the US,

120
0:05:59.145,000 --> 0:06:02,000
police are allowed to interrogate juveniles just like adults.

121
0:06:02.492,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So they can lie to them --

122
0:06:04.607,000 --> 0:06:07,000
blatant lies like, "We have your fingerprints,

123
0:06:08.496,000 --> 0:06:09,000
we have your DNA;

124
0:06:09.689,000 --> 0:06:12,000
your friend is down the hall saying that this was all your idea."

125
0:06:14.038,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Lying to suspects is banned in the UK, for example,

126
0:06:17.995,000 --> 0:06:18,000
but legal here in the US,

127
0:06:19.558,000 --> 0:06:22,000
even with intellectually impaired teens like Brendan Dassey.

128
0:06:24.077,000 --> 0:06:27,000
In our research, most of the incarcerated teens that we interviewed

129
0:06:27.284,000 --> 0:06:29,000
reported experiencing high-pressure police interrogations

130
0:06:30.239,000 --> 0:06:32,000
without lawyers or parents present.

131
0:06:33.407,000 --> 0:06:36,000
More than 80 percent described having been threatened by the police,

132
0:06:36.965,000 --> 0:06:39,000
including with the possibility of being raped or killed in jail

133
0:06:40.5,000 --> 0:06:41,000
or being tried as an adult.

134
0:06:42.889,000 --> 0:06:44,000
These maximization strategies are designed

135
0:06:45.566,000 --> 0:06:47,000
to make suspects feel like denials are pointless

136
0:06:48.432,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and confession is the only option.

137
0:06:51.182,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So you may have heard of playing the role of "good cop/bad cop," right?

138
0:06:54.808,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Well, this is bad cop.

139
0:06:56.813,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Juveniles are more suggestible and susceptible to social influence,

140
0:07:02.006,000 --> 0:07:05,000
like the intense pressure accusations and suggestions

141
0:07:05.43,000 --> 0:07:07,000
coming from authority figures in interrogations.

142
0:07:09.468,000 --> 0:07:11,000
More than 70 percent of the teens in our study said

143
0:07:12.143,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that the police had tried to "befriend" them

144
0:07:14.322,000 --> 0:07:17,000
or indicate a desire to help them out during the interrogation.

145
0:07:18.745,000 --> 0:07:2,000
These are referred to as "minimization strategies,"

146
0:07:21.679,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and they're designed to convey sympathy and understanding to the suspect,

147
0:07:25.749,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and they imply that a confession will result in more lenient treatment.

148
0:07:30.529,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So in the classic good-cop-bad-cop oversimplification

149
0:07:33.923,000 --> 0:07:34,000
of police interrogations,

150
0:07:35.296,000 --> 0:07:36,000
this is "good cop."

151
0:07:36.646,000 --> 0:07:39,000
(Video) P1: Honesty here, Brendan, is the thing that's going to help you, OK?

152
0:07:40.347,000 --> 0:07:41,000
No matter what you did,

153
0:07:41.553,000 --> 0:07:43,000
we can work through that, OK?

154
0:07:43.995,000 --> 0:07:44,000
We can't make any promises,

155
0:07:45.316,000 --> 0:07:48,000
but we'll stand behind you no matter what you did, OK?

156
0:07:50.093,000 --> 0:07:53,000
LM: "No matter what you did, we can work through that."

157
0:07:53.138,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Hints of leniency like you just saw with Brendan

158
0:07:55.401,000 --> 0:07:57,000
are especially powerful among adolescents,

159
0:07:58.135,000 --> 0:08:02,000
in part because they evaluate reward and risk differently than adults do.

160
0:08:03.215,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Confessing brings an immediate reward to the suspect, right?

161
0:08:06.358,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Now the stressful, unpleasant interrogation is over.

162
0:08:09.922,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So confessing may seem like the best option to most teens,

163
0:08:13.223,000 --> 0:08:17,000
who are less focused on that long-term risk of conviction and punishment

164
0:08:17.427,000 --> 0:08:18,000
down the road

165
0:08:18.607,000 --> 0:08:19,000
as a result of that confession.

166
0:08:20.956,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I think we can all agree that thoughtful, long-term planning

167
0:08:23.862,000 --> 0:08:25,000
is not a strength of most teenagers that we know.

168
0:08:27.454,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And by and large, the legal system seems to get

169
0:08:29.999,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that young victims and witnesses should be treated differently than adults.

170
0:08:33.67,000 --> 0:08:37,000
But when it comes to young suspects, it's like the kid gloves come off.

171
0:08:38.487,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And treating juveniles as though they're adults in interrogations

172
0:08:41.6,000 --> 0:08:42,000
is a problem,

173
0:08:42.782,000 --> 0:08:43,000
because literally hundreds

174
0:08:44.063,000 --> 0:08:46,000
of psychological and neuroscientific studies

175
0:08:46.147,000 --> 0:08:48,000
tell us that juveniles do not think like adults,

176
0:08:48.791,000 --> 0:08:49,000
they do not behave like adults,

177
0:08:50.661,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and they're not built like adults.

178
0:08:53.837,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Adolescent brains are different from adult brains --

179
0:08:56.601,000 --> 0:08:57,000
even anatomically.

180
0:08:58.62,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So there are important changes happening

181
0:09:00.599,000 --> 0:09:03,000
in the structure and function of the brain during adolescence,

182
0:09:04.225,000 --> 0:09:07,000
especially in the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system,

183
0:09:07.261,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and these are areas that are crucial for things like self-control,

184
0:09:11.655,000 --> 0:09:12,000
decision-making,

185
0:09:13.029,000 --> 0:09:15,000
emotion processing and regulation

186
0:09:15.36,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and sensitivity to reward and risk,

187
0:09:18.126,000 --> 0:09:21,000
all of which can affect how you function in a stressful circumstance,

188
0:09:21.713,000 --> 0:09:22,000
like a police interrogation.

189
0:09:23.916,000 --> 0:09:25,000
We need to educate law enforcement,

190
0:09:26.223,000 --> 0:09:28,000
attorneys, judges and jurors

191
0:09:28.619,000 --> 0:09:3,000
on juveniles' developmental limitations

192
0:09:30.768,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and how they can play out in a high-stakes interrogation.

193
0:09:34.682,000 --> 0:09:36,000
In one national survey of police officers,

194
0:09:36.76,000 --> 0:09:39,000
75 percent of them actually requested specialized training

195
0:09:39.826,000 --> 0:09:41,000
in how to talk to children and adolescents --

196
0:09:42.023,000 --> 0:09:43,000
most of them had had none.

197
0:09:44.835,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We also need to consider having special protections in place for juveniles.

198
0:09:48.821,000 --> 0:09:52,000
In his 91-page decision to overturn Dassey's conviction earlier this year,

199
0:09:53.125,000 --> 0:09:56,000
the judge made a big deal about the fact that Dassey had no parent

200
0:09:56.658,000 --> 0:09:57,000
or other allied adult

201
0:09:57.833,000 --> 0:09:58,000
in the interrogation room with him.

202
0:10:00.235,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So here's a clip of Brendan talking to his mom after he confessed,

203
0:10:04.495,000 --> 0:10:06,000
when it was obviously far too late for him.

204
0:10:08.351,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Video) Mom: What do you mean?

205
0:10:09.829,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Brendan: Like, if his story is, like, different,

206
0:10:12.214,000 --> 0:10:13,000
like I never did nothing or something.

207
0:10:15.913,000 --> 0:10:16,000
M: Did you?

208
0:10:19.762,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Huh?

209
0:10:20.942,000 --> 0:10:21,000
B: Not really.

210
0:10:22.696,000 --> 0:10:23,000
M: What do you mean, "Not really"?

211
0:10:25.001,000 --> 0:10:26,000
B: They got into my head.

212
0:10:27.381,000 --> 0:10:29,000
LM: So he sums it up pretty beautifully there:

213
0:10:29.595,000 --> 0:10:3,000
"They got into my head."

214
0:10:30.998,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We don't know if the outcome would have been different for Brendan

215
0:10:34.176,000 --> 0:10:36,000
if his mom had been in the interrogation room with him.

216
0:10:36.843,000 --> 0:10:37,000
But it's certainly possible.

217
0:10:38.954,000 --> 0:10:41,000
In our research, only seven percent of incarcerated teens,

218
0:10:42.416,000 --> 0:10:44,000
most of whom had had numerous encounters with police,

219
0:10:45.19,000 --> 0:10:47,000
had ever had a parent or attorney in the room with them

220
0:10:48.211,000 --> 0:10:5,000
when they were questioned as a suspect.

221
0:10:50.324,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Few had ever asked for a parent or attorney to be present.

222
0:10:55.647,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And you see this in lower-stake situations, too.

223
0:10:57.97,000 --> 0:11:01,000
We did a mock interrogation experiment in our lab here at FIU --

224
0:11:02.132,000 --> 0:11:04,000
with parent permission for all minors, of course,

225
0:11:04.5,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and all the appropriate ethical approvals.

226
0:11:07.079,000 --> 0:11:11,000
We falsely accused teens and adults of cheating on a study task --

227
0:11:11.697,000 --> 0:11:12,000
an academic dishonesty offense --

228
0:11:13.356,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that we told them was as serious as cheating in a class.

229
0:11:17.374,000 --> 0:11:19,000
In reality, participants had witnessed a peer cheat,

230
0:11:19.931,000 --> 0:11:21,000
someone who was actually part of our research team

231
0:11:22.369,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and was allegedly on academic probation.

232
0:11:25.136,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And we gave everyone a tough choice:

233
0:11:27.338,000 --> 0:11:29,000
you can lose your extra credit for participating in the study

234
0:11:30.324,000 --> 0:11:31,000
or accuse your peer,

235
0:11:31.745,000 --> 0:11:34,000
who will probably be expelled because of his academic probation status.

236
0:11:35.597,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Of course, in reality, none of these consequences would have panned out,

237
0:11:39.102,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and we fully debriefed all of the participants afterward.

238
0:11:41.858,000 --> 0:11:45,000
But most teenagers -- 59 percent of them --

239
0:11:45.898,000 --> 0:11:46,000
signed the confession statement,

240
0:11:47.479,000 --> 0:11:49,000
falsely taking responsibility for the cheating.

241
0:11:50.617,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Only three teens out of 74,

242
0:11:53.099,000 --> 0:11:54,000
or about four percent of them,

243
0:11:54.623,000 --> 0:11:57,000
asked to talk to a parent when we accused them of cheating,

244
0:11:57.977,000 --> 0:11:58,000
despite the fact that for most of them,

245
0:11:59.929,000 --> 0:12:02,000
their parent was literally sitting in the next room during the study.

246
0:12:04.806,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Of course, cheating is far from murder,

247
0:12:07.061,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and I know that.

248
0:12:08.237,000 --> 0:12:13,000
But it's interesting that so many teens, significantly more teens than adults,

249
0:12:13.698,000 --> 0:12:16,000
signed the confession saying that they cheated.

250
0:12:17.31,000 --> 0:12:18,000
They hadn't cheated,

251
0:12:18.91,000 --> 0:12:2,000
but they signed this form anyway saying that they had,

252
0:12:21.479,000 --> 0:12:23,000
rarely attempting to involve a parent in the situation.

253
0:12:25.671,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Other studies tell the same story.

254
0:12:27.732,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Over 90 percent of juveniles waive their Miranda rights

255
0:12:30.59,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and submit to police questioning without lawyers or parents present.

256
0:12:34.815,000 --> 0:12:37,000
In England and Wales, interrogations of juveniles must be conducted

257
0:12:38.665,000 --> 0:12:4,000
in the presence of an "appropriate adult,"

258
0:12:40.727,000 --> 0:12:42,000
like a parent, guardian or social worker.

259
0:12:43.43,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And this isn't something youth have to ask for --

260
0:12:45.822,000 --> 0:12:47,000
which is great, because research shows that they won't --

261
0:12:48.522,000 --> 0:12:49,000
it's automatic.

262
0:12:51.332,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Now, having an appropriate adult safeguard for juveniles here in the US

263
0:12:54.7,000 --> 0:12:57,000
would not be a cure-all for improving police questioning of youth.

264
0:12:59.035,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Unfortunately, parents often lack the knowledge and legal sophistication

265
0:13:03.068,000 --> 0:13:05,000
to appropriately advise their children.

266
0:13:05.677,000 --> 0:13:08,000
You can just look at the case of the Central Park Five:

267
0:13:08.837,000 --> 0:13:13,000
five teenagers who falsely confessed to a brutal gang rape in 1989,

268
0:13:13.989,000 --> 0:13:15,000
with their parents by their sides.

269
0:13:16.986,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And it took over a decade to clear their names.

270
0:13:19.971,000 --> 0:13:21,000
So the appropriate adult really should be an attorney

271
0:13:22.974,000 --> 0:13:23,000
or perhaps a trained child advocate.

272
0:13:26.373,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Overturning Dassey's conviction, the judge pointed out that there's no federal law

273
0:13:30.386,000 --> 0:13:32,000
requiring that the police even inform a juvenile's parent

274
0:13:33.321,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that the juvenile is being questioned

275
0:13:35.189,000 --> 0:13:38,000
or honor that juvenile's request to have a parent in the room.

276
0:13:39.613,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So if you think about all of this together for a second:

277
0:13:42.505,000 --> 0:13:45,000
as a country, we've decided that juveniles cannot be trusted

278
0:13:46.506,000 --> 0:13:47,000
with things like voting,

279
0:13:48.087,000 --> 0:13:49,000
buying cigarettes,

280
0:13:49.559,000 --> 0:13:5,000
attending an R-rated movie

281
0:13:51.329,000 --> 0:13:52,000
or driving,

282
0:13:52.71,000 --> 0:13:55,000
but they can make the judgment call to waive their Miranda rights,

283
0:13:56.03,000 --> 0:14:,000
rights that we know from research, most teens don't understand or appreciate.

284
0:14:01.467,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And parents in the room: depending on the state that you live in,

285
0:14:04.57,000 --> 0:14:07,000
your child can potentially waive these rights without your knowledge

286
0:14:07.832,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and without consulting any adult first.

287
0:14:11.747,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Now, no one -- and certainly not me -- wants to prevent police

288
0:14:14.951,000 --> 0:14:16,000
from doing the very important investigative work

289
0:14:17.236,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that they do every day.

290
0:14:19.167,000 --> 0:14:23,000
But we need to make sure that they have appropriate training for talking to youth.

291
0:14:23.502,000 --> 0:14:25,000
As a parent and as a researcher,

292
0:14:25.731,000 --> 0:14:26,000
I think we can do better.

293
0:14:28.069,000 --> 0:14:31,000
I think we can take steps to prevent another Brendan Dassey,

294
0:14:31.737,000 --> 0:14:34,000
while still getting the crucial information that we need

295
0:14:35.006,000 --> 0:14:36,000
from children and teens

296
0:14:36.186,000 --> 0:14:37,000
to solve crimes.

297
0:14:37.831,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Thank you.

298
0:14:39.12,000 --> 0:14:41,000
(Applause)

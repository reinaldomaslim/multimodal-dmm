1
0:00:12.693,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm going to ask and try to answer,

2
0:00:14.948,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in some ways, kind of an uncomfortable question.

3
0:00:19.846,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Both civilians, obviously, and soldiers

4
0:00:22.2,000 --> 0:00:24,000
suffer in war;

5
0:00:24.286,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I don't think any civilian has ever missed

6
0:00:26.75,000 --> 0:00:29,000
the war that they were subjected to.

7
0:00:30.112,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I've been covering wars for almost 20 years,

8
0:00:32.13,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and one of the remarkable things for me

9
0:00:35.458,000 --> 0:00:38,000
is how many soldiers find themselves missing it.

10
0:00:39.342,000 --> 0:00:41,000
How is it someone can go through

11
0:00:41.647,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the worst experience imaginable,

12
0:00:43.984,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and come home, back to their home,

13
0:00:45.96,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and their family, their country, and miss the war?

14
0:00:49.421,000 --> 0:00:52,000
How does that work? What does it mean?

15
0:00:52.992,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We have to answer that question,

16
0:00:56.45,000 --> 0:00:58,000
because if we don't, it'll be impossible

17
0:00:59.317,000 --> 0:01:,000
to bring soldiers back

18
0:01:00.585,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to a place in society where they belong,

19
0:01:04.64,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and I think it'll also be impossible to stop war,

20
0:01:06.893,000 --> 0:01:09,000
if we don't understand how that mechanism works.

21
0:01:09.911,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The problem is that war

22
0:01:13.173,000 --> 0:01:16,000
does not have a simple, neat truth,

23
0:01:17.01,000 --> 0:01:19,000
one simple, neat truth.

24
0:01:19.709,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Any sane person hates war,

25
0:01:21.97,000 --> 0:01:22,000
hates the idea of war,

26
0:01:23.825,000 --> 0:01:25,000
wouldn't want to have anything to do with it,

27
0:01:26.402,000 --> 0:01:29,000
doesn't want to be near it, doesn't want to know about it.

28
0:01:29.518,000 --> 0:01:31,000
That's a sane response to war.

29
0:01:32.202,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But if I asked all of you in this room,

30
0:01:34.969,000 --> 0:01:37,000
who here has paid money

31
0:01:38.327,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to go to a cinema

32
0:01:40.313,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and be entertained by a Hollywood war movie,

33
0:01:43.703,000 --> 0:01:46,000
most of you would probably raise your hands.

34
0:01:47.261,000 --> 0:01:49,000
That's what's so complicated about war.

35
0:01:49.857,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And trust me, if a room full of peace-loving people

36
0:01:53.397,000 --> 0:01:56,000
finds something compelling about war,

37
0:01:56.636,000 --> 0:01:58,000
so do 20-year-old soldiers

38
0:01:59.379,000 --> 0:02:02,000
who have been trained in it, I promise you.

39
0:02:02.641,000 --> 0:02:05,000
That's the thing that has to be understood.

40
0:02:05.945,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I've covered war for about 20 years, as I said,

41
0:02:08.767,000 --> 0:02:1,000
but my most intense experiences in combat

42
0:02:11.393,000 --> 0:02:15,000
were with American soldiers in Afghanistan.

43
0:02:15.625,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I've been in Africa, the Middle East,

44
0:02:16.94,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Afghanistan in the '90s,

45
0:02:18.69,000 --> 0:02:21,000
but it was with American soldiers in 2007, 2008,

46
0:02:22.537,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that I was confronted with

47
0:02:25.17,000 --> 0:02:26,000
very intense combat.

48
0:02:26.69,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I was in a small valley called the Korengal Valley

49
0:02:28.73,000 --> 0:02:3,000
in eastern Afghanistan.

50
0:02:31.563,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It was six miles long.

51
0:02:33.349,000 --> 0:02:36,000
There were 150 men of Battle Company in that valley,

52
0:02:36.491,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and for a while, while I was there,

53
0:02:40.025,000 --> 0:02:42,000
almost 20 percent of all the combat

54
0:02:42.301,000 --> 0:02:43,000
in all of Afghanistan was happening

55
0:02:44.097,000 --> 0:02:45,000
in those six miles.

56
0:02:45.93,000 --> 0:02:47,000
A hundred and fifty men were absorbing

57
0:02:48.481,000 --> 0:02:51,000
almost a fifth of the combat for all of NATO forces

58
0:02:51.633,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in the country, for a couple months.

59
0:02:54.159,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It was very intense.

60
0:02:56.296,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I spent most of my time at a small outpost

61
0:02:58.365,000 --> 0:02:59,000
called Restrepo.

62
0:02:59.939,000 --> 0:03:,000
It was named after the platoon medic

63
0:03:01.499,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that had been killed about two months into the deployment.

64
0:03:04.353,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It was a few plywood B-huts

65
0:03:08.293,000 --> 0:03:11,000
clinging to a side of a ridge,

66
0:03:12.102,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and sandbags, bunkers, gun positions,

67
0:03:16.879,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and there were 20 men up there

68
0:03:18.69,000 --> 0:03:2,000
of Second Platoon, Battle Company.

69
0:03:20.775,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I spent most of my time up there.

70
0:03:22.375,000 --> 0:03:23,000
There was no running water.

71
0:03:23.99,000 --> 0:03:24,000
There was no way to bathe.

72
0:03:25.001,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The guys were up there for a month at a time.

73
0:03:27.44,000 --> 0:03:29,000
They never even got out of their clothes.

74
0:03:29.964,000 --> 0:03:3,000
They fought. The worked.

75
0:03:31.114,000 --> 0:03:33,000
They slept in the same clothes.

76
0:03:33.86,000 --> 0:03:34,000
They never took them off, and at the end of the month,

77
0:03:35.339,000 --> 0:03:37,000
they went back down to the company headquarters,

78
0:03:37.65,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and by then, their clothes were unwearable.

79
0:03:39.717,000 --> 0:03:41,000
They burned them and got a new set.

80
0:03:42.01,000 --> 0:03:43,000
There was no Internet. There was no phone.

81
0:03:43.73,000 --> 0:03:46,000
There was no communication with the outside world up there.

82
0:03:47.629,000 --> 0:03:49,000
There was no cooked food.

83
0:03:50.459,000 --> 0:03:52,000
There was nothing up there

84
0:03:53.03,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that young men typically like:

85
0:03:54.93,000 --> 0:03:57,000
no cars, no girls, no television, nothing

86
0:03:58.211,000 --> 0:03:59,000
except combat.

87
0:04:00.075,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Combat they did learn to like.

88
0:04:04.036,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I remember one day, it was a very hot day

89
0:04:06.487,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in the spring,

90
0:04:08.253,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and we hadn't been in a fight

91
0:04:10.634,000 --> 0:04:12,000
in a couple of weeks, maybe.

92
0:04:13.08,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Usually, the outpost was attacked,

93
0:04:15.644,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and we hadn't seen any combat in a couple of weeks,

94
0:04:18.507,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and everyone was just stunned

95
0:04:21.11,000 --> 0:04:23,000
with boredom and heat.

96
0:04:23.267,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And I remember the lieutenant walking past me

97
0:04:27.801,000 --> 0:04:28,000
sort of stripped to the waist.

98
0:04:29.274,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It was incredibly hot.

99
0:04:31.676,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Stripped to the waist, walked past me muttering,

100
0:04:34.04,000 --> 0:04:36,000
"Oh God, please someone attack us today."

101
0:04:36.792,000 --> 0:04:38,000
That's how bored they were.

102
0:04:39.142,000 --> 0:04:42,000
That's war too, is a lieutenant saying,

103
0:04:42.208,000 --> 0:04:44,000
"Please make something happen

104
0:04:44.868,000 --> 0:04:46,000
because we're going crazy."

105
0:04:46.911,000 --> 0:04:48,000
To understand that,

106
0:04:49.259,000 --> 0:04:5,000
you have to, for a moment,

107
0:04:51.169,000 --> 0:04:53,000
think about combat not morally --

108
0:04:53.57,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that's an important job to do —

109
0:04:55.455,000 --> 0:04:56,000
but for a moment, don't think about it morally,

110
0:04:57.348,000 --> 0:04:59,000
think about it neurologically.

111
0:05:00.219,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Let's think about what happens in your brain

112
0:05:02.431,000 --> 0:05:04,000
when you're in combat.

113
0:05:04.804,000 --> 0:05:06,000
First of all, the experience

114
0:05:07.156,000 --> 0:05:11,000
is very bizarre, it's a very bizarre one.

115
0:05:11.77,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It's not what I had expected.

116
0:05:14.76,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Usually, you're not scared.

117
0:05:16.49,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I've been very scared in combat,

118
0:05:18.61,000 --> 0:05:2,000
but most of the time when I was out there,

119
0:05:20.712,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I wasn't scared.

120
0:05:21.839,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I was very scared beforehand

121
0:05:23.366,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and incredibly scared afterwards,

122
0:05:25.281,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and that fear that comes afterwards can last years.

123
0:05:27.883,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I haven't been shot at in six years,

124
0:05:29.835,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and I was woken up very abruptly this morning

125
0:05:32.188,000 --> 0:05:35,000
by a nightmare that I was being strafed by aircraft,

126
0:05:35.433,000 --> 0:05:36,000
six years later.

127
0:05:36.64,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I've never even been strafed by aircraft,

128
0:05:38.374,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and I was having nightmares about it.

129
0:05:41.75,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Time slows down.

130
0:05:43.123,000 --> 0:05:45,000
You get this weird tunnel vision.

131
0:05:45.347,000 --> 0:05:48,000
You notice some details very, very, very accurately

132
0:05:49.008,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and other things drop out.

133
0:05:51.195,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It's almost a slightly altered state of mind.

134
0:05:54.158,000 --> 0:05:55,000
What's happening in your brain

135
0:05:55.629,000 --> 0:05:57,000
is you're getting an enormous amount of adrenaline

136
0:05:58.346,000 --> 0:05:59,000
pumped through your system.

137
0:06:00.166,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Young men will go to great lengths

138
0:06:02.76,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to have that experience.

139
0:06:05.096,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It's wired into us.

140
0:06:08.018,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It's hormonally supported.

141
0:06:11.86,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The mortality rate for young men in society

142
0:06:15.745,000 --> 0:06:17,000
is six times what it is for young women

143
0:06:18.165,000 --> 0:06:19,000
from violence and from accidents,

144
0:06:19.97,000 --> 0:06:21,000
just the stupid stuff that young men do:

145
0:06:22.159,000 --> 0:06:24,000
jumping off of things they shouldn't jump off of,

146
0:06:24.461,000 --> 0:06:26,000
lighting things on fire they shouldn't light on fire,

147
0:06:26.88,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I mean, you know what I'm talking about.

148
0:06:29.118,000 --> 0:06:31,000
They die at six times the rate

149
0:06:31.159,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that young women do.

150
0:06:32.599,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Statistically, you are safer as a teenage boy,

151
0:06:36.503,000 --> 0:06:38,000
you would be safer in the fire department

152
0:06:39.146,000 --> 0:06:41,000
or the police department in most American cities

153
0:06:41.71,000 --> 0:06:43,000
than just walking around the streets of your hometown

154
0:06:44.232,000 --> 0:06:46,000
looking for something to do,

155
0:06:46.59,000 --> 0:06:49,000
statistically.

156
0:06:49.65,000 --> 0:06:52,000
You can imagine how that plays out in combat.

157
0:06:52.888,000 --> 0:06:55,000
At Restrepo, every guy up there was almost killed,

158
0:06:55.95,000 --> 0:06:56,000
including me,

159
0:06:57.644,000 --> 0:06:59,000
including my good friend Tim Hetherington,

160
0:06:59.704,000 --> 0:07:01,000
who was later killed in Libya.

161
0:07:02.126,000 --> 0:07:03,000
There were guys walking around

162
0:07:03.802,000 --> 0:07:04,000
with bullet holes in their uniforms,

163
0:07:05.623,000 --> 0:07:06,000
rounds that had cut through the fabric

164
0:07:07.51,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and didn't touch their bodies.

165
0:07:10.892,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I was leaning against some sandbags one morning,

166
0:07:13.974,000 --> 0:07:15,000
not much going on, sort of spacing out,

167
0:07:16.971,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and some sand was kicked into the side of,

168
0:07:20.478,000 --> 0:07:22,000
sort of hit the side of my face.

169
0:07:23.148,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Something hit the side of my face, and I didn't know what it was.

170
0:07:25.361,000 --> 0:07:26,000
You have to understand about bullets

171
0:07:26.9,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that they go a lot faster than sound,

172
0:07:28.798,000 --> 0:07:29,000
so if someone shoots at you

173
0:07:30.211,000 --> 0:07:32,000
from a few hundred meters,

174
0:07:32.268,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the bullet goes by you, or hits you obviously,

175
0:07:35.411,000 --> 0:07:37,000
half a second or so before the sound catches up to it.

176
0:07:38.063,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So I had some sand sprayed in the side of my face.

177
0:07:40.95,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Half a second later, I heard dut-dut-dut-dut-duh.

178
0:07:42.95,000 --> 0:07:43,000
It was machine gun fire.

179
0:07:43.964,000 --> 0:07:45,000
It was the first round, the first burst

180
0:07:46.31,000 --> 0:07:48,000
of an hour-long firefight.

181
0:07:49.173,000 --> 0:07:52,000
What had happened was the bullet hit,

182
0:07:52.238,000 --> 0:07:55,000
a bullet hit three or four inches from the side of my head.

183
0:07:55.981,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Imagine, just think about it, because I certainly did,

184
0:08:00.63,000 --> 0:08:01,000
think about the angle of deviation that saved my life.

185
0:08:02.51,000 --> 0:08:04,000
At 400 meters, it missed me by three inches.

186
0:08:04.972,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Just think about the math on that.

187
0:08:09.268,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Every guy up there

188
0:08:11.052,000 --> 0:08:12,000
had some experience like that,

189
0:08:12.974,000 --> 0:08:15,000
at least once, if not many times.

190
0:08:16.502,000 --> 0:08:18,000
The boys are up there for a year.

191
0:08:18.982,000 --> 0:08:19,000
They got back.

192
0:08:20.751,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Some of them got out of the Army

193
0:08:22.11,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and had tremendous psychological problems when they got home.

194
0:08:24.704,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Some of them stayed in the Army

195
0:08:26.239,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and were more or less okay, psychologically.

196
0:08:29.862,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I was particularly close to a guy named Brendan O'Byrne.

197
0:08:32.939,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I'm still very good friends with him.

198
0:08:34.827,000 --> 0:08:37,000
He came back to the States. He got out of the Army.

199
0:08:37.883,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I had a dinner party one night.

200
0:08:39.851,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I invited him,

201
0:08:41.645,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and he started talking with a woman,

202
0:08:45.08,000 --> 0:08:46,000
one of my friends,

203
0:08:46.317,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and she knew how bad it had been out there,

204
0:08:49.369,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and she said, "Brendan,

205
0:08:51.118,000 --> 0:08:54,000
is there anything at all that you miss about

206
0:08:54.446,000 --> 0:08:57,000
being out in Afghanistan, about the war?"

207
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And he thought about it quite a long time,

208
0:09:01.169,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and finally he said, "Ma'am, I miss almost all of it."

209
0:09:06.552,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And he's one of the most traumatized people

210
0:09:09.994,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I've seen from that war.

211
0:09:13.083,000 --> 0:09:15,000
"Ma'am, I miss almost all of it."

212
0:09:15.094,000 --> 0:09:18,000
What is he talking about?

213
0:09:18.179,000 --> 0:09:21,000
He's not a psychopath.

214
0:09:21.621,000 --> 0:09:22,000
He doesn't miss killing people.

215
0:09:23.28,000 --> 0:09:25,000
He's not crazy. He doesn't miss getting shot at

216
0:09:25.56,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and seeing his friends get killed.

217
0:09:27.262,000 --> 0:09:3,000
What is it that he misses? We have to answer that.

218
0:09:31.09,000 --> 0:09:37,000
If we're going to stop war, we have to answer that question.

219
0:09:37.816,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I think what he missed is brotherhood.

220
0:09:42.994,000 --> 0:09:43,000
He missed, in some ways,

221
0:09:44.75,000 --> 0:09:45,000
the opposite of killing.

222
0:09:46.146,000 --> 0:09:48,000
What he missed was connection

223
0:09:48.478,000 --> 0:09:5,000
to the other men he was with.

224
0:09:50.826,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Now, brotherhood is different from friendship.

225
0:09:53.342,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Friendship happens in society, obviously.

226
0:09:57.096,000 --> 0:09:58,000
The more you like someone,

227
0:09:58.634,000 --> 0:10:,000
the more you'd be willing to do for them.

228
0:10:00.708,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Brotherhood has nothing to do

229
0:10:02.214,000 --> 0:10:05,000
with how you feel about the other person.

230
0:10:05.706,000 --> 0:10:07,000
It's a mutual agreement in a group

231
0:10:08.688,000 --> 0:10:1,000
that you will put the welfare of the group,

232
0:10:10.93,000 --> 0:10:12,000
you will put the safety of everyone in the group

233
0:10:12.95,000 --> 0:10:13,000
above your own.

234
0:10:14.81,000 --> 0:10:17,000
In effect, you're saying,

235
0:10:18.187,000 --> 0:10:23,000
"I love these other people more than I love myself."

236
0:10:23.602,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Brendan was a team leader

237
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:26,000
in command of three men,

238
0:10:26.863,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and the worst day in Afghanistan —

239
0:10:30.3,000 --> 0:10:32,000
He was almost killed so many times.

240
0:10:33.179,000 --> 0:10:34,000
It didn't bother him.

241
0:10:34.514,000 --> 0:10:36,000
The worst thing that happened to him in Afghanistan

242
0:10:37.092,000 --> 0:10:39,000
was one of his men was hit in the head with a bullet

243
0:10:39.908,000 --> 0:10:43,000
in the helmet, knocked him over.

244
0:10:44.392,000 --> 0:10:45,000
They thought he was dead.

245
0:10:45.52,000 --> 0:10:46,000
It was in the middle of a huge firefight.

246
0:10:46.97,000 --> 0:10:48,000
No one could deal with it, and a minute later,

247
0:10:48.99,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Kyle Steiner sat back up

248
0:10:51.03,000 --> 0:10:52,000
from the dead, as it were,

249
0:10:52.955,000 --> 0:10:54,000
because he'd come back to consciousness.

250
0:10:54.98,000 --> 0:10:55,000
The bullet had just knocked him out.

251
0:10:56.252,000 --> 0:10:57,000
It glanced off the helmet.

252
0:10:58.179,000 --> 0:11:,000
He remembers people saying,

253
0:11:00.245,000 --> 0:11:01,000
as he was sort of half-conscious,

254
0:11:01.707,000 --> 0:11:04,000
he remembers people saying,

255
0:11:05.206,000 --> 0:11:07,000
"Steiner's been hit in the head. Steiner's dead."

256
0:11:07.277,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And he was thinking, "I'm not dead."

257
0:11:08.899,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And he sat up.

258
0:11:10.647,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And Brendan realized after that

259
0:11:12.844,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that he could not protect his men,

260
0:11:14.485,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and that was the only time he cried in Afghanistan,

261
0:11:16.863,000 --> 0:11:18,000
was realizing that.

262
0:11:19.828,000 --> 0:11:21,000
That's brotherhood.

263
0:11:22.34,000 --> 0:11:24,000
This wasn't invented recently.

264
0:11:24.772,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Many of you have probably read "The Iliad."

265
0:11:27.269,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Achilles surely would have risked his life

266
0:11:29.24,000 --> 0:11:33,000
or given his life to save his friend Patroclus.

267
0:11:34.018,000 --> 0:11:36,000
In World War II, there were many stories

268
0:11:36.956,000 --> 0:11:39,000
of soldiers who were wounded,

269
0:11:40.032,000 --> 0:11:42,000
were brought to a rear base hospital,

270
0:11:42.099,000 --> 0:11:43,000
who went AWOL,

271
0:11:43.455,000 --> 0:11:45,000
crawled out of windows, slipped out doors,

272
0:11:45.675,000 --> 0:11:48,000
went AWOL, wounded,

273
0:11:49.273,000 --> 0:11:5,000
to make their way back to the front lines

274
0:11:50.675,000 --> 0:11:52,000
to rejoin their brothers out there.

275
0:11:53.311,000 --> 0:11:55,000
So you think about Brendan,

276
0:11:55.66,000 --> 0:11:58,000
you think about all these soldiers

277
0:11:59.016,000 --> 0:12:01,000
having an experience like that, a bond like that,

278
0:12:01.901,000 --> 0:12:02,000
in a small group,

279
0:12:03.781,000 --> 0:12:04,000
where they loved 20 other people

280
0:12:05.679,000 --> 0:12:07,000
in some ways more than they loved themselves,

281
0:12:08.598,000 --> 0:12:13,000
you think about how good that would feel, imagine it,

282
0:12:13.714,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and they are blessed with that experience for a year,

283
0:12:18.344,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and then they come home,

284
0:12:19.833,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and they are just back in society

285
0:12:22.82,000 --> 0:12:24,000
like the rest of us are,

286
0:12:25.659,000 --> 0:12:27,000
not knowing who they can count on,

287
0:12:28.085,000 --> 0:12:33,000
not knowing who loves them, who they can love,

288
0:12:33.262,000 --> 0:12:35,000
not knowing exactly what anyone they know

289
0:12:35.853,000 --> 0:12:37,000
would do for them if it came down to it.

290
0:12:38.087,000 --> 0:12:41,000
That is terrifying.

291
0:12:41.673,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Compared to that,

292
0:12:43.663,000 --> 0:12:47,000
war, psychologically, in some ways, is easy,

293
0:12:47.737,000 --> 0:12:49,000
compared to that kind of alienation.

294
0:12:50.234,000 --> 0:12:51,000
That's why they miss it,

295
0:12:51.624,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and that's what we have to understand

296
0:12:54.102,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and in some ways fix in our society.

297
0:12:57.505,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Thank you very much.

298
0:13:00.435,000 --> 0:13:02,000
(Applause)

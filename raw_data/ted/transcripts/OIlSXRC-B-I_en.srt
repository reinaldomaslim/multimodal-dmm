1
0:00:12.81,000 --> 0:00:13,000
You may know this feeling:

2
0:00:14.81,000 --> 0:00:17,000
you wake up to multiple unread notifications on your mobile phone.

3
0:00:19.532,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Your calendar is already packed with meetings,

4
0:00:21.738,000 --> 0:00:23,000
sometimes double- or triple-booked.

5
0:00:24.822,000 --> 0:00:25,000
You feel engaged, you feel busy.

6
0:00:27.395,000 --> 0:00:28,000
In fact, you feel productive.

7
0:00:30.573,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But at the end of it all, something still feels missing.

8
0:00:36.176,000 --> 0:00:38,000
You try to figure out what it is.

9
0:00:38.804,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But before you do,

10
0:00:40.53,000 --> 0:00:41,000
the next day starts all over again.

11
0:00:44.272,000 --> 0:00:46,000
That was how I felt two years ago.

12
0:00:48.177,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I felt stressed; I felt anxious.

13
0:00:50.916,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I felt a bit trapped.

14
0:00:53.457,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The world around me was moving very quickly.

15
0:00:57.431,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And I didn't know what to do.

16
0:01:00.019,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I started wondering to myself:

17
0:01:02.205,000 --> 0:01:03,000
How do I keep up with all this?

18
0:01:04.257,000 --> 0:01:06,000
How do we find fulfillment

19
0:01:06.839,000 --> 0:01:1,000
in a world that's literally changing as fast as we can think,

20
0:01:11.627,000 --> 0:01:12,000
or maybe even faster?

21
0:01:15.516,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I started looking for answers.

22
0:01:17.594,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I spoke to many people, I spoke to my friends,

23
0:01:20.421,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I spoke to my family.

24
0:01:21.919,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I even read many self-help books.

25
0:01:25.615,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But I couldn't find anything satisfactory.

26
0:01:28.49,000 --> 0:01:3,000
In fact, the more self-help books I read,

27
0:01:30.974,000 --> 0:01:32,000
the more stressed and anxious I became.

28
0:01:33.503,000 --> 0:01:34,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:34.673,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It was like I was feeding my mind with junk food,

30
0:01:37.998,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and I was becoming mentally obese.

31
0:01:40.787,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:42.847,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I was about to give up,

33
0:01:45.133,000 --> 0:01:47,000
until one day, I found this.

34
0:01:48.076,000 --> 0:01:52,000
"The Tao Te Ching: The Book of the Way and Its Virtue."

35
0:01:54.028,000 --> 0:01:57,000
This is an ancient Chinese philosophy classic

36
0:01:57.196,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that was written more than 2,600 years ago.

37
0:02:00.601,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And it was by far the thinnest and the smallest book on the bookshelf.

38
0:02:06.162,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It only had 81 pages.

39
0:02:08.488,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And each page had a short poem.

40
0:02:11.201,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I remember I flipped to one particular poem.

41
0:02:15.206,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Here it is.

42
0:02:16.382,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

43
0:02:17.658,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:19.133,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Let me read it out to you.

45
0:02:21.419,000 --> 0:02:24,000
"The supreme goodness is like water.

46
0:02:25.473,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It benefits all things without contention.

47
0:02:29.038,000 --> 0:02:31,000
In dwelling, it stays grounded.

48
0:02:32.427,000 --> 0:02:34,000
In being, it flows to depths.

49
0:02:35.445,000 --> 0:02:37,000
In expression, it is honest.

50
0:02:38.901,000 --> 0:02:4,000
In confrontation, it stays gentle.

51
0:02:42.52,000 --> 0:02:44,000
In governance, it does not control.

52
0:02:45.258,000 --> 0:02:47,000
In action, it aligns to timing.

53
0:02:48.37,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It is content with its nature

54
0:02:50.989,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and therefore cannot be faulted."

55
0:02:54.998,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Wow! I remember when I first read this passage.

56
0:02:57.911,000 --> 0:03:,000
I felt the biggest chills down my spine.

57
0:03:01.553,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I still feel that today, reading it to you guys.

58
0:03:05.048,000 --> 0:03:08,000
My anxiety and stress just suddenly disappeared.

59
0:03:09.239,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Ever since that day,

60
0:03:10.898,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I've been trying to apply the concepts in this passage to my day-to-day life.

61
0:03:16.406,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And today, I'd like to share with you three lessons I learned so far

62
0:03:19.731,000 --> 0:03:2,000
from this philosophy of water --

63
0:03:21.604,000 --> 0:03:25,000
three lessons that I believe have helped me find greater fulfillment

64
0:03:25.986,000 --> 0:03:26,000
in almost everything that I do.

65
0:03:29.023,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The first lesson is about humility.

66
0:03:32.475,000 --> 0:03:34,000
If we think about water flowing in a river,

67
0:03:34.809,000 --> 0:03:35,000
it is always staying low.

68
0:03:37.847,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It helps all the plants grow and keeps all the animals alive.

69
0:03:41.427,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It doesn't actually draw any attention to itself,

70
0:03:44.021,000 --> 0:03:46,000
nor does it need any reward or recognition.

71
0:03:47.442,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It is humble.

72
0:03:49.792,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But without water's humble contribution,

73
0:03:52.315,000 --> 0:03:54,000
life as we know it may not exist.

74
0:03:57.103,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Water's humility taught me a few important things.

75
0:04:00.492,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It taught me that instead of acting like I know what I'm doing

76
0:04:04.024,000 --> 0:04:05,000
or I have all the answers,

77
0:04:05.744,000 --> 0:04:07,000
it's perfectly OK to say,

78
0:04:07.823,000 --> 0:04:08,000
"I don't know.

79
0:04:09.212,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I want to learn more,

80
0:04:10.633,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and I need your help."

81
0:04:12.911,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It also taught me that, instead of promoting my glory and success,

82
0:04:17.028,000 --> 0:04:2,000
it is so much more satisfying to promote the success and glory of others.

83
0:04:21.879,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It taught me that, instead of doing things where I can get ahead,

84
0:04:25.807,000 --> 0:04:27,000
it so much more fulfilling and meaningful

85
0:04:27.903,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to help other people overcome their challenges so they can succeed.

86
0:04:33.473,000 --> 0:04:34,000
With a humble mindset,

87
0:04:34.649,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I was able to form a lot richer connections with the people around me.

88
0:04:39.18,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I became genuinely interested in the stories and experiences

89
0:04:42.799,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that make them unique and magical.

90
0:04:45.235,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Life became a lot more fun,

91
0:04:46.554,000 --> 0:04:49,000
because every day I'd discover new quirks, new ideas

92
0:04:49.625,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and new solutions to problems I didn't know before,

93
0:04:52.37,000 --> 0:04:55,000
all thanks to the ideas and help from others.

94
0:04:57.093,000 --> 0:04:59,000
All streams eventually flow to the ocean

95
0:04:59.95,000 --> 0:05:,000
because it is lower than them.

96
0:05:02.965,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Humility gives water its power.

97
0:05:06.649,000 --> 0:05:1,000
But I think it gives us the capacity to remain grounded,

98
0:05:11.077,000 --> 0:05:12,000
to be present,

99
0:05:12.459,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to learn from and be transformed by the stories of the people around us.

100
0:05:18.434,000 --> 0:05:2,000
The second lesson I learned is about harmony.

101
0:05:21.919,000 --> 0:05:23,000
If we think about water flowing towards a rock,

102
0:05:24.315,000 --> 0:05:25,000
it will just flow around it.

103
0:05:26.125,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It doesn't get upset, it doesn't get angry,

104
0:05:28.728,000 --> 0:05:29,000
it doesn't get agitated.

105
0:05:30.276,000 --> 0:05:31,000
In fact, it doesn't feel much at all.

106
0:05:32.687,000 --> 0:05:36,000
When faced with an obstacle, somehow water finds a solution,

107
0:05:37.662,000 --> 0:05:39,000
without force, without conflict.

108
0:05:41.955,000 --> 0:05:43,000
When I was thinking through this, I began to understand

109
0:05:44.607,000 --> 0:05:46,000
why I was feeling stressed out in the first place.

110
0:05:47.506,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Instead of working in harmony with my environment,

111
0:05:50.046,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I was working against it.

112
0:05:52.369,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I was forcing things to change

113
0:05:53.891,000 --> 0:05:57,000
because I was consumed by the need to succeed or to prove myself.

114
0:05:58.616,000 --> 0:05:59,000
In the end, nothing did.

115
0:06:00.775,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And I got more frustrated.

116
0:06:03.211,000 --> 0:06:06,000
By simply shifting my focus from trying to achieve more success

117
0:06:06.68,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to trying to achieve more harmony,

118
0:06:09.45,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I was immediately able to feel calm and focused again.

119
0:06:13.796,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I started asking questions like:

120
0:06:15.677,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Will this action bring me greater harmony

121
0:06:18.423,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and bring more harmony to my environment?

122
0:06:20.779,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Does this align with my nature?

123
0:06:24.388,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I became more comfortable simply being who I am,

124
0:06:27.285,000 --> 0:06:29,000
rather than who I'm supposed to be or expected to be.

125
0:06:31.809,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Work actually became easier,

126
0:06:33.792,000 --> 0:06:35,000
because I stopped focusing on things that I cannot control

127
0:06:36.546,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and only on the things that I can.

128
0:06:38.427,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I stopped fighting with myself,

129
0:06:41.244,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and I learned to work with my environment to solve its problems.

130
0:06:46.267,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Nature does not hurry.

131
0:06:48.879,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Yet, everything is accomplished.

132
0:06:51.704,000 --> 0:06:54,000
That's Tao Te Ching's way of describing the power of harmony.

133
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
Just as water is able to find a solution without force or conflict,

134
0:07:01.006,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I believe we can find a greater sense of fulfillment in our endeavors

135
0:07:05.173,000 --> 0:07:08,000
by shifting focus from achieving more success

136
0:07:08.498,000 --> 0:07:09,000
to achieving more harmony.

137
0:07:11.228,000 --> 0:07:15,000
The third lesson I learned from the philosophy of water

138
0:07:15.411,000 --> 0:07:16,000
is about openness.

139
0:07:17.744,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Water is open to change.

140
0:07:20.395,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Depending on the temperature, it can be a liquid, solid or gas.

141
0:07:24.965,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Depending on the medium it's in,

142
0:07:26.521,000 --> 0:07:29,000
it can be a teapot, a cup or a flower vase.

143
0:07:30.566,000 --> 0:07:34,000
In fact, it's water's ability to adapt and change and remain flexible

144
0:07:34.9,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that made it so enduring through the ages,

145
0:07:37.289,000 --> 0:07:39,000
despite all the changes in the environment.

146
0:07:41.002,000 --> 0:07:44,000
We also live in a world today of constant change.

147
0:07:44.979,000 --> 0:07:47,000
We can no longer expect to work to a static job description

148
0:07:48.209,000 --> 0:07:49,000
or follow a single career path.

149
0:07:50.792,000 --> 0:07:53,000
We, too, are expected to constantly reinvent and refresh our skills

150
0:07:54.649,000 --> 0:07:55,000
to stay relevant.

151
0:07:57.419,000 --> 0:07:59,000
In our organization, we host a lot of hackathons,

152
0:08:00.237,000 --> 0:08:02,000
where small groups or individuals come together

153
0:08:02.517,000 --> 0:08:04,000
to solve a business problem in a compressed time frame.

154
0:08:05.601,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And what's interesting to me is that the teams that usually win

155
0:08:08.902,000 --> 0:08:11,000
are not the ones with the most experienced team members,

156
0:08:12.268,000 --> 0:08:14,000
but the ones with members who are open to learn,

157
0:08:15.077,000 --> 0:08:16,000
who are open to unlearn

158
0:08:16.998,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and who are open to helping each other

159
0:08:19.141,000 --> 0:08:21,000
navigate through the changing circumstances.

160
0:08:23.244,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Life is like a hackathon in some way.

161
0:08:26.014,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It's calling to each and every one of us to step up, to open up

162
0:08:30.382,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and cause a ripple effect.

163
0:08:32.8,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Now, we can stay behind closed doors and continue to be paralyzed

164
0:08:36.991,000 --> 0:08:38,000
by our self-limiting beliefs, such as:

165
0:08:39.823,000 --> 0:08:41,000
"I will never be able to talk about Chinese philosophy

166
0:08:42.38,000 --> 0:08:43,000
in front of a huge audience."

167
0:08:43.808,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Laughter)

168
0:08:44.88,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Or we can just open up and enjoy the ride.

169
0:08:47.828,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It can only be an amazing experience.

170
0:08:51.077,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So humility, harmony and openness.

171
0:08:54.703,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Those are the three lessons I learned from the philosophy of water so far.

172
0:08:58.752,000 --> 0:09:,000
They nicely abbreviate to H-H-O,

173
0:09:01.348,000 --> 0:09:02,000
or H2O.

174
0:09:02.542,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Laughter)

175
0:09:03.629,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And they have become my guiding principles in life.

176
0:09:07.885,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So nowadays, whenever I feel stressed,

177
0:09:10.529,000 --> 0:09:13,000
unfulfilled, anxious or just not sure what to do,

178
0:09:14.025,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I simply ask the question:

179
0:09:16.247,000 --> 0:09:17,000
What would water do?

180
0:09:17.724,000 --> 0:09:18,000
(Laughter)

181
0:09:18.97,000 --> 0:09:21,000
This simple and powerful question inspired by a book

182
0:09:22.55,000 --> 0:09:26,000
written long before the days of bitcoin, fintech and digital technology

183
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
has changed my life for the better.

184
0:09:29.685,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Try it, and let me know how it works for you.

185
0:09:32.164,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I would love to hear from you.

186
0:09:33.704,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Thank you.

187
0:09:34.879,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Applause)

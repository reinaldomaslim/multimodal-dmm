2
0:00:15.888,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Salaam alaikum.

3
0:00:18.804,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Welcome to Doha.

4
0:00:20.49,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I am in charge of making this country's food secure.

5
0:00:23.892,000 --> 0:00:25,000
That is my job for the next two years,

6
0:00:25.943,000 --> 0:00:27,000
to design an entire master plan,

7
0:00:28.359,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and then for the next 10 years to implement it --

8
0:00:31.892,000 --> 0:00:33,000
of course, with so many other people.

9
0:00:33.912,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But first, I need to talk to you about a story, which is my story,

10
0:00:38.559,000 --> 0:00:41,000
about the story of this country that you're all here in today.

11
0:00:42.427,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And of course, most of you have had three meals today,

12
0:00:45.977,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and probably will continue to have after this event.

13
0:00:50.51,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So going in, what was Qatar in the 1940s?

14
0:00:54.943,000 --> 0:00:58,000
We were about 11,000 people living here.

15
0:00:59.143,000 --> 0:01:06,000
There was no water. There was no energy, no oil, no cars, none of that.

16
0:01:06.159,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Most of the people who lived here

17
0:01:07.554,000 --> 0:01:09,000
either lived in coastal villages, fishing,

18
0:01:10.026,000 --> 0:01:15,000
or were nomads who roamed around with the environment trying to find water.

19
0:01:15.976,000 --> 0:01:18,000
None of the glamour that you see today existed.

20
0:01:19.378,000 --> 0:01:24,000
No cities like you see today in Doha or Dubai or Abu Dhabi or Kuwait or Riyadh.

21
0:01:24.526,000 --> 0:01:26,000
It wasn't that they couldn't develop cities.

22
0:01:27.143,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Resources weren't there to develop them.

23
0:01:29.242,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And you can see that life expectancy was also short.

24
0:01:32.075,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Most people died around the age of 50.

25
0:01:33.977,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So let's move to chapter two: the oil era.

26
0:01:37.776,000 --> 0:01:4,000
1939, that's when they discovered oil.

27
0:01:40.993,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But unfortunately, it wasn't really fully exploited commercially

28
0:01:45.793,000 --> 0:01:47,000
until after the Second World War.

29
0:01:48.243,000 --> 0:01:5,000
What did it do?

30
0:01:50.377,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It changed the face of this country, as you can see today and witness.

31
0:01:53.677,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It also made all those people who roamed around the desert --

32
0:01:57.409,000 --> 0:02:,000
looking for water, looking for food,

33
0:02:00.693,000 --> 0:02:04,000
trying to take care of their livestock -- urbanize.

34
0:02:04.796,000 --> 0:02:05,000
You might find this strange,

35
0:02:06.76,000 --> 0:02:09,000
but in my family we have different accents.

36
0:02:10.609,000 --> 0:02:14,000
My mother has an accent that is so different to my father,

37
0:02:14.609,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and we're all a population of about 300,000 people in the same country.

38
0:02:19.643,000 --> 0:02:22,000
There are about five or six accents in this country as I speak.

39
0:02:23.177,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Someone says, "How so? How could this happen?"

40
0:02:26.993,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Because we lived scattered.

41
0:02:28.776,000 --> 0:02:33,000
We couldn't live in a concentrated way simply because there was no resources.

42
0:02:33.928,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And when the resources came, be it oil,

43
0:02:37.739,000 --> 0:02:4,000
we started building these fancy technologies

44
0:02:40.793,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and bringing people together because we needed the concentration.

45
0:02:44.443,000 --> 0:02:46,000
People started to get to know each other.

46
0:02:46.827,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And we realized that there are some differences in accents.

47
0:02:50.776,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So that is the chapter two: the oil era.

48
0:02:53.711,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Let's look at today.

49
0:02:55.826,000 --> 0:02:59,000
This is probably the skyline that most of you know about Doha.

50
0:03:00.552,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So what's the population today?

51
0:03:01.943,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It's 1.7 million people.

52
0:03:04.193,000 --> 0:03:06,000
That is in less than 60 years.

53
0:03:06.892,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The average growth of our economy is about 15 percent for the past five years.

54
0:03:12.794,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Lifespan has increased to 78.

55
0:03:15.627,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Water consumption has increased to 430 liters.

56
0:03:20.436,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And this is amongst the highest worldwide.

57
0:03:23.843,000 --> 0:03:25,000
From having no water whatsoever

58
0:03:26.01,000 --> 0:03:31,000
to consuming water to the highest degree, higher than any other nation.

59
0:03:31.494,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I don't know if this was a reaction to lack of water.

60
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But what is interesting about the story that I've just said?

61
0:03:41.46,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The interesting part is that we continue to grow

62
0:03:44.643,000 --> 0:03:5,000
15 percent every year for the past five years without water.

63
0:03:51.243,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Now that is historic. It's never happened before in history.

64
0:03:56.193,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water.

65
0:04:00.126,000 --> 0:04:02,000
This is history being made in this region.

66
0:04:02.642,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Not only cities that we're building,

67
0:04:04.559,000 --> 0:04:09,000
but cities with dreams and people who are wishing to be scientists, doctors.

68
0:04:09.712,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Build a nice home, bring the architect, design my house.

69
0:04:12.861,000 --> 0:04:18,000
These people are adamant that this is a livable space when it wasn't.

70
0:04:19.06,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But of course, with the use of technology.

71
0:04:21.029,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So Brazil has 1,782 millimeters per year of precipitation of rain.

72
0:04:27.543,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Qatar has 74, and we have that growth rate.

73
0:04:30.394,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The question is how.

74
0:04:32.41,000 --> 0:04:35,000
How could we survive that?

75
0:04:35.676,000 --> 0:04:37,000
We have no water whatsoever.

76
0:04:37.76,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Simply because of this gigantic, mammoth machine called desalination.

77
0:04:44.059,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Energy is the key factor here. It changed everything.

78
0:04:48.227,000 --> 0:04:52,000
It is that thing that we pump out of the ground, we burn tons of,

79
0:04:52.726,000 --> 0:04:55,000
probably most of you used it coming to Doha.

80
0:04:55.726,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So that is our lake, if you can see it.

81
0:04:58.627,000 --> 0:04:59,000
That is our river.

82
0:05:00.476,000 --> 0:05:05,000
That is how you all happen to use and enjoy water.

83
0:05:05.818,000 --> 0:05:11,000
This is the best technology that this region could ever have: desalination.

84
0:05:12.444,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So what are the risks?

85
0:05:14.712,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Do you worry much?

86
0:05:16.262,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I would say, perhaps if you look at the global facts,

87
0:05:20.178,000 --> 0:05:22,000
you will realize, of course I have to worry.

88
0:05:22.769,000 --> 0:05:24,000
There is growing demand, growing population.

89
0:05:25.278,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We've turned seven billion only a few months ago.

90
0:05:28.527,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And so that number also demands food.

91
0:05:32.019,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And there's predictions that we'll be nine billion by 2050.

92
0:05:35.227,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So a country that has no water

93
0:05:38.083,000 --> 0:05:41,000
has to worry about what happens beyond its borders.

94
0:05:41.734,000 --> 0:05:43,000
There's also changing diets.

95
0:05:44.066,000 --> 0:05:48,000
By elevating to a higher socio-economic level,

96
0:05:48.132,000 --> 0:05:5,000
they also change their diet.

97
0:05:50.315,000 --> 0:05:53,000
They start eating more meat and so on and so forth.

98
0:05:53.315,000 --> 0:05:55,000
On the other hand, there is declining yields

99
0:05:55.668,000 --> 0:05:57,000
because of climate change and because of other factors.

100
0:05:58.366,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen.

101
0:06:03.534,000 --> 0:06:06,000
This is the situation in Qatar, for those who don't know.

102
0:06:07.349,000 --> 0:06:1,000
We only have two days of water reserve.

103
0:06:10.699,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We import 90 percent of our food,

104
0:06:12.983,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land.

105
0:06:16.683,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The limited number of farmers that we have

106
0:06:19.132,000 --> 0:06:22,000
have been pushed out of their farming practices

107
0:06:22.666,000 --> 0:06:27,000
as a result of open market policy and bringing the big competitions, etc., etc.

108
0:06:28.215,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So we also face risks.

109
0:06:31.466,000 --> 0:06:38,000
These risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity.

110
0:06:38.649,000 --> 0:06:4,000
The question is, is there a solution?

111
0:06:41.167,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Is there a sustainable solution?

112
0:06:43.349,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Indeed there is.

113
0:06:45.333,000 --> 0:06:49,000
This slide sums up thousands of pages of technical documents

114
0:06:49.366,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that we've been working on over the past two years.

115
0:06:52.05,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Let's start with the water.

116
0:06:53.482,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So we know very well -- I showed you earlier -- that we need this energy.

117
0:06:57.251,000 --> 0:07:,000
So if we're going to need energy, what sort of energy?

118
0:07:00.349,000 --> 0:07:02,000
A depletable energy? Fossil fuel?

119
0:07:02.648,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Or should we use something else?

120
0:07:05.043,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy?

121
0:07:08.382,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I guess most of you by now realize that we do: 300 days of sun.

122
0:07:12.516,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need.

123
0:07:17.848,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And we will probably put 1,800 megawatts of solar systems

124
0:07:23.249,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to produce 3.5 million cubic meters of water.

125
0:07:25.858,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And that is a lot of water.

126
0:07:27.882,000 --> 0:07:29,000
That water will go then to the farmers,

127
0:07:30.15,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and the farmers will be able to water their plants,

128
0:07:32.387,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and they will be able then to supply society with food.

129
0:07:36.517,000 --> 0:07:38,000
But in order to sustain the horizontal line --

130
0:07:38.634,000 --> 0:07:41,000
because these are the projects, these are the systems that we will deliver --

131
0:07:41.965,000 --> 0:07:43,000
we need to also develop the vertical line:

132
0:07:44.599,000 --> 0:07:49,000
system sustenance, high-level education, research and development,

133
0:07:49.917,000 --> 0:07:54,000
industries, technologies, to produce these technologies for application, and finally markets.

134
0:07:54.979,000 --> 0:08:,000
But what gels all of it, what enables it, is legislation, policies, regulations.

135
0:08:01.112,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Without it we can't do anything.

136
0:08:03.345,000 --> 0:08:04,000
So that's what we are planning to do.

137
0:08:04.897,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Within two years we should hopefully be done with this plan

138
0:08:08.428,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and taking it to implementation.

139
0:08:10.395,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Our objective is to be a millennium city, just like many millennium cities around:

140
0:08:17.095,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Istanbul, Rome, London, Paris, Damascus, Cairo.

141
0:08:24.23,000 --> 0:08:28,000
We are only 60 years old, but we want to live forever

142
0:08:28.325,000 --> 0:08:32,000
as a city, to live in peace.

143
0:08:32.886,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Thank you very much.

144
0:08:34.831,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.853,000 --> 0:00:14,000
"Can you taste words?"

2
0:00:15.8,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It was a question that caught me by surprise.

3
0:00:18.88,000 --> 0:00:21,000
This summer, I was giving a talk at a literary festival,

4
0:00:22.015,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and afterwards, as I was signing books,

5
0:00:24.715,000 --> 0:00:26,000
a teenage girl came with her friend,

6
0:00:27.418,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and this is what she asked me.

7
0:00:29.475,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I told her that some people experience an overlap in their senses

8
0:00:34.316,000 --> 0:00:35,000
so that they could hear colors

9
0:00:36.167,000 --> 0:00:37,000
or see sounds,

10
0:00:37.719,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and many writers were fascinated by this subject, myself included.

11
0:00:43.181,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But she cut me off, a bit impatiently, and said, "Yeah, I know all of that.

12
0:00:48.074,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It's called synesthesia. We learned it at school.

13
0:00:51.386,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But my mom is reading your book,

14
0:00:53.839,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and she says there's lots of food and ingredients

15
0:00:57.314,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and a long dinner scene in it.

16
0:00:59.222,000 --> 0:01:01,000
She gets hungry at every page.

17
0:01:01.412,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So I was thinking,

18
0:01:02.982,000 --> 0:01:04,000
how come you don't get hungry when you write?

19
0:01:05.238,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And I thought maybe, maybe you could taste words.

20
0:01:08.83,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Does it make sense?"

21
0:01:10.701,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And, actually, it did make sense,

22
0:01:12.9,000 --> 0:01:14,000
because ever since my childhood,

23
0:01:15.031,000 --> 0:01:18,000
each letter in the alphabet has a different color,

24
0:01:18.728,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and colors bring me flavors.

25
0:01:21.281,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So for instance, the color purple is quite pungent, almost perfumed,

26
0:01:26.911,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and any words that I associate with purple

27
0:01:30.752,000 --> 0:01:32,000
taste the same way,

28
0:01:32.942,000 --> 0:01:35,000
such as "sunset" -- a very spicy word.

29
0:01:37.271,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But I was worried that if I tell all of this to the teenager,

30
0:01:41.993,000 --> 0:01:43,000
it might sound either too abstract

31
0:01:44.167,000 --> 0:01:46,000
or perhaps too weird,

32
0:01:46.955,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and there wasn't enough time anyhow,

33
0:01:48.719,000 --> 0:01:5,000
because people were waiting in the queue,

34
0:01:51.004,000 --> 0:01:55,000
so it suddenly felt like what I was trying to convey

35
0:01:55.56,000 --> 0:01:58,000
was more complicated and detailed

36
0:01:58.633,000 --> 0:02:01,000
than what the circumstances allowed me to say.

37
0:02:03.392,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And I did what I usually do in similar situations:

38
0:02:07.643,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I stammered, I shut down, and I stopped talking.

39
0:02:11.272,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I stopped talking because the truth was complicated,

40
0:02:15.462,000 --> 0:02:17,000
even though I knew, deep within,

41
0:02:17.913,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that one should never, ever remain silent for fear of complexity.

42
0:02:24.342,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So I want to start my talk today

43
0:02:26.227,000 --> 0:02:29,000
with the answer that I was not able to give on that day.

44
0:02:29.772,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Yes, I can taste words --

45
0:02:32.093,000 --> 0:02:34,000
sometimes, that is, not always,

46
0:02:34.257,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and happy words have a different flavor than sad words.

47
0:02:38.305,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I like to explore: What does the word "creativity" taste like,

48
0:02:42.996,000 --> 0:02:44,000
or "equality,"

49
0:02:45.034,000 --> 0:02:47,000
"love," "revolution?"

50
0:02:47.504,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And what about "motherland?"

51
0:02:50.178,000 --> 0:02:54,000
These days, it's particularly this last word that troubles me.

52
0:02:54.446,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It leaves a sweet taste on my tongue,

53
0:02:57.039,000 --> 0:03:,000
like cinnamon, a bit of rose water

54
0:03:00.449,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and golden apples.

55
0:03:01.873,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But underneath, there's a sharp tang,

56
0:03:05.095,000 --> 0:03:07,000
like nettles and dandelion.

57
0:03:07.719,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The taste of my motherland, Turkey,

58
0:03:11.03,000 --> 0:03:14,000
is a mixture of sweet and bitter.

59
0:03:15.55,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And the reason why I'm telling you this

60
0:03:17.516,000 --> 0:03:19,000
is because I think there's more and more people

61
0:03:19.963,000 --> 0:03:2,000
all around the world today

62
0:03:21.779,000 --> 0:03:23,000
who have similarly mixed emotions

63
0:03:24.668,000 --> 0:03:26,000
about the lands they come from.

64
0:03:26.964,000 --> 0:03:28,000
We love our native countries, yeah?

65
0:03:29.649,000 --> 0:03:3,000
How can we not?

66
0:03:30.873,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We feel attached to the people, the culture, the land, the food.

67
0:03:35.338,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And yet at the same time,

68
0:03:36.554,000 --> 0:03:41,000
we feel increasingly frustrated by its politics and politicians,

69
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
sometimes to the point of despair or hurt or anger.

70
0:03:47.908,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I want to talk about emotions

71
0:03:50.06,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and the need to boost our emotional intelligence.

72
0:03:53.817,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I think it's a pity

73
0:03:54.992,000 --> 0:04:,000
that mainstream political theory pays very little attention to emotions.

74
0:04:01.019,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Oftentimes, analysts and experts are so busy with data and metrics

75
0:04:06.637,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that they seem to forget those things in life

76
0:04:09.598,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that are difficult to measure

77
0:04:11.456,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and perhaps impossible to cluster under statistical models.

78
0:04:16.745,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But I think this is a mistake, for two main reasons.

79
0:04:20.134,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Firstly, because we are emotional beings.

80
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:26,000
As human beings, I think we all are like that.

81
0:04:26.547,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But secondly, and this is new,

82
0:04:29.245,000 --> 0:04:32,000
we have entered a new stage in world history

83
0:04:32.924,000 --> 0:04:38,000
in which collective sentiments guide and misguide politics

84
0:04:38.967,000 --> 0:04:4,000
more than ever before.

85
0:04:41.771,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And through social media and social networking,

86
0:04:44.915,000 --> 0:04:46,000
these sentiments are further amplified,

87
0:04:47.825,000 --> 0:04:5,000
polarized, and they travel around the world quite fast.

88
0:04:52.135,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Ours is the age of anxiety, anger,

89
0:04:56.074,000 --> 0:04:58,000
distrust, resentment

90
0:04:58.612,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and, I think, lots of fear.

91
0:05:00.932,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But here's the thing:

92
0:05:02.251,000 --> 0:05:06,000
even though there's plenty of research about economic factors,

93
0:05:07.05,000 --> 0:05:11,000
there's relatively few studies about emotional factors.

94
0:05:12.015,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Why is it that we underestimate feelings and perceptions?

95
0:05:17.183,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I think it's going to be one of our biggest intellectual challenges,

96
0:05:21.197,000 --> 0:05:26,000
because our political systems are replete with emotions.

97
0:05:26.521,000 --> 0:05:27,000
In country after country,

98
0:05:28.351,000 --> 0:05:33,000
we have seen illiberal politicians exploiting these emotions.

99
0:05:33.787,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And yet within the academia and among the intelligentsia,

100
0:05:37.429,000 --> 0:05:4,000
we are yet to take emotions seriously.

101
0:05:41.019,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I think we should.

102
0:05:42.317,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And just like we should focus on economic inequality worldwide,

103
0:05:46.206,000 --> 0:05:52,000
we need to pay more attention to emotional and cognitive gaps worldwide

104
0:05:52.846,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and how to bridge these gaps,

105
0:05:54.68,000 --> 0:05:56,000
because they do matter.

106
0:05:57.554,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Years ago, when I was still living in Istanbul,

107
0:06:00.328,000 --> 0:06:04,000
an American scholar working on women writers in the Middle East

108
0:06:04.388,000 --> 0:06:05,000
came to see me.

109
0:06:06.324,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And at some point in our exchange, she said,

110
0:06:08.873,000 --> 0:06:09,000
"I understand why you're a feminist,

111
0:06:10.853,000 --> 0:06:12,000
because, you know, you live in Turkey."

112
0:06:14.349,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And I said to her,

113
0:06:15.531,000 --> 0:06:17,000
"I don't understand why you're not a feminist,

114
0:06:17.803,000 --> 0:06:19,000
because, you know, you live in America."

115
0:06:20.079,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Laughter)

116
0:06:22.623,000 --> 0:06:24,000
(Applause)

117
0:06:25.609,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And she laughed.

118
0:06:28.11,000 --> 0:06:29,000
She took it as a joke,

119
0:06:29.718,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and the moment passed.

120
0:06:31.561,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Laughter)

121
0:06:33.482,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But the way she had divided the world into two imaginary camps,

122
0:06:38.416,000 --> 0:06:39,000
into two opposite camps --

123
0:06:40.383,000 --> 0:06:42,000
it bothered me and it stayed with me.

124
0:06:43.047,000 --> 0:06:45,000
According to this imaginary map,

125
0:06:45.567,000 --> 0:06:48,000
some parts of the world were liquid countries.

126
0:06:49.113,000 --> 0:06:52,000
They were like choppy waters not yet settled.

127
0:06:52.407,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Some other parts of the world, namely the West,

128
0:06:55.742,000 --> 0:06:58,000
were solid, safe and stable.

129
0:06:59.071,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So it was the liquid lands that needed feminism

130
0:07:02.409,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and activism and human rights,

131
0:07:04.83,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and those of us who were unfortunate enough

132
0:07:07.252,000 --> 0:07:08,000
to come from such places

133
0:07:09.088,000 --> 0:07:13,000
had to keep struggling for these most essential values.

134
0:07:13.886,000 --> 0:07:14,000
But there was hope.

135
0:07:15.097,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Since history moved forward,

136
0:07:16.928,000 --> 0:07:2,000
even the most unsteady lands would someday catch up.

137
0:07:21.341,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And meanwhile, the citizens of solid lands

138
0:07:24.363,000 --> 0:07:28,000
could take comfort in the progress of history

139
0:07:28.559,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and in the triumph of the liberal order.

140
0:07:31.833,000 --> 0:07:34,000
They could support the struggles of other people elsewhere,

141
0:07:35.82,000 --> 0:07:38,000
but they themselves did not have to struggle

142
0:07:39.37,000 --> 0:07:42,000
for the basics of democracy anymore,

143
0:07:42.722,000 --> 0:07:44,000
because they were beyond that stage.

144
0:07:46.524,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I think in the year 2016,

145
0:07:48.993,000 --> 0:07:52,000
this hierarchical geography was shattered to pieces.

146
0:07:54.144,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Our world no longer follows this dualistic pattern

147
0:07:58.258,000 --> 0:08:01,000
in the scholar's mind, if it ever did.

148
0:08:01.876,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Now we know that history does not necessarily move forward.

149
0:08:06.259,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Sometimes it draws circles,

150
0:08:08.206,000 --> 0:08:09,000
even slides backwards,

151
0:08:10.187,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and that generations can make the same mistakes

152
0:08:13.158,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that their great-grandfathers had made.

153
0:08:16.016,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And now we know that there's no such thing

154
0:08:18.647,000 --> 0:08:21,000
as solid countries versus liquid countries.

155
0:08:22.478,000 --> 0:08:26,000
In fact, we are all living in liquid times,

156
0:08:26.946,000 --> 0:08:29,000
just like the late Zygmunt Bauman told us.

157
0:08:30.617,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And Bauman had another definition for our age.

158
0:08:33.833,000 --> 0:08:38,000
He used to say we are all going to be walking on moving sands.

159
0:08:40.052,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And if that's the case, I think,

160
0:08:42.31,000 --> 0:08:45,000
it should concern us women more than men,

161
0:08:45.635,000 --> 0:08:49,000
because when societies slide backwards into authoritarianism,

162
0:08:49.749,000 --> 0:08:51,000
nationalism or religious fanaticism,

163
0:08:52.569,000 --> 0:08:54,000
women have much more to lose.

164
0:08:55.46,000 --> 0:08:57,000
That is why this needs to be a vital moment,

165
0:08:58.305,000 --> 0:09:,000
not only for global activism,

166
0:09:00.52,000 --> 0:09:03,000
but in my opinion, for global sisterhood as well.

167
0:09:04.403,000 --> 0:09:08,000
(Applause)

168
0:09:12.555,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But I want to make a little confession before I go any further.

169
0:09:15.927,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Until recently, whenever I took part in an international conference or festival,

170
0:09:21.132,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I would be usually one of the more depressed speakers.

171
0:09:25.347,000 --> 0:09:26,000
(Laughter)

172
0:09:26.629,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Having seen how our dreams of democracy and how our dreams of coexistence

173
0:09:32.477,000 --> 0:09:33,000
were crushed in Turkey,

174
0:09:34.464,000 --> 0:09:38,000
both gradually but also with a bewildering speed,

175
0:09:38.717,000 --> 0:09:4,000
over the years I've felt quite demoralized.

176
0:09:41.731,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And at these festivals there would be some other gloomy writers,

177
0:09:45.868,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and they would come from places such as Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan,

178
0:09:50.811,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Bangladesh, Philippines, China, Venezuela, Russia.

179
0:09:55.856,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And we would smile at each other in sympathy,

180
0:09:58.233,000 --> 0:10:,000
this camaraderie of the doomed.

181
0:10:00.354,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Laughter)

182
0:10:02.985,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And you could call us WADWIC:

183
0:10:05.213,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Worried and Depressed Writers International Club.

184
0:10:09.355,000 --> 0:10:1,000
(Laughter)

185
0:10:11.101,000 --> 0:10:12,000
But then things began to change,

186
0:10:12.896,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and suddenly our club became more popular,

187
0:10:16.883,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and we started to have new members.

188
0:10:19.416,000 --> 0:10:2,000
I remember --

189
0:10:20.889,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Laughter)

190
0:10:23.375,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I remember Greek writers and poets joined first, came on board.

191
0:10:28.645,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And then writers from Hungary and Poland,

192
0:10:32.426,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and then, interestingly, writers from Austria, the Netherlands, France,

193
0:10:37.922,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and then writers from the UK, where I live and where I call my home,

194
0:10:42.381,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and then writers from the USA.

195
0:10:46.487,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Suddenly, there were more of us

196
0:10:48.554,000 --> 0:10:5,000
feeling worried about the fate of our nations

197
0:10:51.361,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and the future of the world.

198
0:10:53.647,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And maybe there were more of us now

199
0:10:56.177,000 --> 0:10:59,000
feeling like strangers in our own motherlands.

200
0:11:00.444,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And then this bizarre thing happened.

201
0:11:02.645,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Those of us who used to be very depressed for a long time,

202
0:11:06.156,000 --> 0:11:08,000
we started to feel less depressed,

203
0:11:08.902,000 --> 0:11:11,000
whereas the newcomers, they were so not used to feeling this way

204
0:11:12.628,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that they were now even more depressed.

205
0:11:14.704,000 --> 0:11:15,000
(Laughter)

206
0:11:15.823,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So you could see writers from Bangladesh or Turkey or Egypt

207
0:11:20.685,000 --> 0:11:23,000
trying to console their colleagues

208
0:11:24.139,000 --> 0:11:28,000
from Brexit Britain or from post-election USA.

209
0:11:28.622,000 --> 0:11:29,000
(Laughter)

210
0:11:31.05,000 --> 0:11:32,000
But joking aside,

211
0:11:32.321,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I think our world is full of unprecedented challenges,

212
0:11:36.742,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and this comes with an emotional backlash,

213
0:11:39.804,000 --> 0:11:41,000
because in the face of high-speed change,

214
0:11:42.049,000 --> 0:11:44,000
many people wish to slow down,

215
0:11:44.14,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and when there's too much unfamiliarity,

216
0:11:46.732,000 --> 0:11:48,000
people long for the familiar.

217
0:11:49.193,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And when things get too confusing,

218
0:11:51.463,000 --> 0:11:54,000
many people crave simplicity.

219
0:11:54.527,000 --> 0:11:56,000
This is a very dangerous crossroads,

220
0:11:56.988,000 --> 0:12:01,000
because it's exactly where the demagogue enters into the picture.

221
0:12:03.267,000 --> 0:12:06,000
The demagogue understands how collective sentiments work

222
0:12:07.158,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and how he -- it's usually a he -- can benefit from them.

223
0:12:11.819,000 --> 0:12:14,000
He tells us that we all belong in our tribes,

224
0:12:15.433,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and he tells us that we will be safer if we are surrounded by sameness.

225
0:12:21.165,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Demagogues come in all sizes and in all shapes.

226
0:12:23.949,000 --> 0:12:27,000
This could be the eccentric leader of a marginal political party

227
0:12:28.284,000 --> 0:12:29,000
somewhere in Europe,

228
0:12:29.644,000 --> 0:12:34,000
or an Islamist extremist imam preaching dogma and hatred,

229
0:12:35.39,000 --> 0:12:4,000
or it could be a white supremacist Nazi-admiring orator somewhere else.

230
0:12:41.114,000 --> 0:12:45,000
All these figures, at first glance -- they seem disconnected.

231
0:12:45.29,000 --> 0:12:47,000
But I think they feed each other,

232
0:12:47.714,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and they need each other.

233
0:12:50.507,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And all around the world,

234
0:12:51.747,000 --> 0:12:56,000
when we look at how demagogues talk and how they inspire movements,

235
0:12:57.536,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I think they have one unmistakable quality in common:

236
0:13:01.89,000 --> 0:13:05,000
they strongly, strongly dislike plurality.

237
0:13:06.4,000 --> 0:13:08,000
They cannot deal with multiplicity.

238
0:13:09.668,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Adorno used to say,

239
0:13:11.29,000 --> 0:13:17,000
"Intolerance of ambiguity is the sign of an authoritarian personality."

240
0:13:18.529,000 --> 0:13:19,000
But I ask myself:

241
0:13:19.891,000 --> 0:13:2,000
What if that same sign,

242
0:13:21.878,000 --> 0:13:24,000
that same intolerance of ambiguity --

243
0:13:25.055,000 --> 0:13:3,000
what if it's the mark of our times, of the age we're living in?

244
0:13:30.451,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Because wherever I look, I see nuances withering away.

245
0:13:34.339,000 --> 0:13:38,000
On TV shows, we have one anti-something speaker

246
0:13:38.397,000 --> 0:13:41,000
situated against a pro-something speaker.

247
0:13:41.641,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Yeah? It's good ratings.

248
0:13:43.149,000 --> 0:13:45,000
It's even better if they shout at each other.

249
0:13:45.921,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Even in academia, where our intellect is supposed to be nourished,

250
0:13:50.496,000 --> 0:13:56,000
you see one atheist scholar competing with a firmly theist scholar,

251
0:13:56.795,000 --> 0:13:58,000
but it's not a real intellectual exchange,

252
0:13:59.783,000 --> 0:14:02,000
because it's a clash between two certainties.

253
0:14:04.003,000 --> 0:14:08,000
I think binary oppositions are everywhere.

254
0:14:08.539,000 --> 0:14:1,000
So slowly and systematically,

255
0:14:11.084,000 --> 0:14:15,000
we are being denied the right to be complex.

256
0:14:16.305,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Istanbul, Berlin, Nice, Paris, Brussels,

257
0:14:19.932,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Dhaka, Baghdad, Barcelona:

258
0:14:22.602,000 --> 0:14:25,000
we have seen one horrible terror attack after another.

259
0:14:26.505,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And when you express your sorrow, and when you react against the cruelty,

260
0:14:30.921,000 --> 0:14:31,000
you get all kinds of reactions,

261
0:14:32.787,000 --> 0:14:34,000
messages on social media.

262
0:14:34.866,000 --> 0:14:35,000
But one of them is quite disturbing,

263
0:14:36.726,000 --> 0:14:38,000
only because it's so widespread.

264
0:14:38.948,000 --> 0:14:41,000
They say, "Why do you feel sorry for them?

265
0:14:43.392,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Why do you feel sorry for them?

266
0:14:45.596,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Why don't you feel sorry for civilians in Yemen

267
0:14:48.562,000 --> 0:14:5,000
or civilians in Syria?"

268
0:14:51.793,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And I think the people who write such messages

269
0:14:54.217,000 --> 0:14:55,000
do not understand

270
0:14:55.697,000 --> 0:15:,000
that we can feel sorry for and stand in solidarity with

271
0:15:00.768,000 --> 0:15:04,000
victims of terrorism and violence in the Middle East, in Europe,

272
0:15:05.413,000 --> 0:15:07,000
in Asia, in America, wherever, everywhere,

273
0:15:08.373,000 --> 0:15:1,000
equally and simultaneously.

274
0:15:11.004,000 --> 0:15:14,000
They don't seem to understand that we don't have to pick one pain

275
0:15:14.762,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and one place over all others.

276
0:15:18.86,000 --> 0:15:21,000
But I think this is what tribalism does to us.

277
0:15:22.467,000 --> 0:15:24,000
It shrinks our minds, for sure,

278
0:15:24.8,000 --> 0:15:26,000
but it also shrinks our hearts,

279
0:15:26.946,000 --> 0:15:31,000
to such an extent that we become numb to the suffering of other people.

280
0:15:33.52,000 --> 0:15:35,000
And the sad truth is, we weren't always like this.

281
0:15:36.508,000 --> 0:15:4,000
I had a children's book out in Turkey,

282
0:15:40.544,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and when the book was published, I did lots of events.

283
0:15:43.543,000 --> 0:15:44,000
I went to many primary schools,

284
0:15:45.177,000 --> 0:15:48,000
which gave me a chance to observe younger kids in Turkey.

285
0:15:49.093,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And it was always amazing to see how much empathy, imagination

286
0:15:53.959,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and chutzpah they have.

287
0:15:55.423,000 --> 0:15:59,000
These children are much more inclined to become global citizens

288
0:15:59.474,000 --> 0:16:01,000
than nationalists at that age.

289
0:16:02.004,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And it's wonderful to see, when you ask them,

290
0:16:04.125,000 --> 0:16:07,000
so many of them want to be poets and writers,

291
0:16:07.24,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and girls are just as confident as boys,

292
0:16:10.662,000 --> 0:16:11,000
if not even more.

293
0:16:12.626,000 --> 0:16:14,000
But then I would go to high schools,

294
0:16:14.829,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and everything has changed.

295
0:16:16.668,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Now nobody wants to be a writer anymore,

296
0:16:18.858,000 --> 0:16:2,000
now nobody wants to be a novelist anymore,

297
0:16:21.318,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and girls have become timid,

298
0:16:24.096,000 --> 0:16:26,000
they are cautious, guarded,

299
0:16:26.254,000 --> 0:16:29,000
reluctant to speak up in the public space,

300
0:16:29.518,000 --> 0:16:3,000
because we have taught them --

301
0:16:31.218,000 --> 0:16:33,000
the family, the school, the society --

302
0:16:33.691,000 --> 0:16:36,000
we have taught them to erase their individuality.

303
0:16:37.866,000 --> 0:16:38,000
I think East and West,

304
0:16:39.211,000 --> 0:16:41,000
we are losing multiplicity,

305
0:16:41.791,000 --> 0:16:45,000
both within our societies and within ourselves.

306
0:16:46.352,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And coming from Turkey, I do know that the loss of diversity

307
0:16:50.587,000 --> 0:16:52,000
is a major, major loss.

308
0:16:53.098,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Today, my motherland became the world's biggest jailer

309
0:16:56.449,000 --> 0:16:57,000
for journalists,

310
0:16:57.813,000 --> 0:17:,000
surpassing even China's sad record.

311
0:17:02.11,000 --> 0:17:07,000
And I also believe that what happened over there in Turkey

312
0:17:07.528,000 --> 0:17:08,000
can happen anywhere.

313
0:17:09.005,000 --> 0:17:11,000
It can even happen here.

314
0:17:11.467,000 --> 0:17:15,000
So just like solid countries was an illusion,

315
0:17:15.717,000 --> 0:17:19,000
singular identities is also an illusion,

316
0:17:20.052,000 --> 0:17:25,000
because we all have a multiplicity of voices inside.

317
0:17:25.865,000 --> 0:17:28,000
The Iranian, the Persian poet, Hafiz,

318
0:17:29.23,000 --> 0:17:34,000
used to say, "You carry in your soul every ingredient necessary

319
0:17:34.638,000 --> 0:17:36,000
to turn your existence into joy.

320
0:17:37.543,000 --> 0:17:4,000
All you have to do is to mix those ingredients."

321
0:17:41.309,000 --> 0:17:42,000
And I think mix we can.

322
0:17:43.31,000 --> 0:17:46,000
I am an Istanbulite,

323
0:17:46.446,000 --> 0:17:48,000
but I'm also attached to the Balkans,

324
0:17:48.633,000 --> 0:17:5,000
the Aegean, the Mediterranean,

325
0:17:51.057,000 --> 0:17:53,000
the Middle East, the Levant.

326
0:17:53.381,000 --> 0:17:55,000
I am a European by birth, by choice,

327
0:17:56.176,000 --> 0:17:58,000
the values that I uphold.

328
0:17:58.44,000 --> 0:18:,000
I have become a Londoner over the years.

329
0:18:01.037,000 --> 0:18:05,000
I would like to think of myself as a global soul, as a world citizen,

330
0:18:05.801,000 --> 0:18:08,000
a nomad and an itinerant storyteller.

331
0:18:09.82,000 --> 0:18:12,000
I have multiple attachments, just like all of us do.

332
0:18:13.601,000 --> 0:18:16,000
And multiple attachments mean multiple stories.

333
0:18:18.448,000 --> 0:18:22,000
As writers, we always chase stories, of course,

334
0:18:23.181,000 --> 0:18:26,000
but I think we are also interested in silences,

335
0:18:26.299,000 --> 0:18:28,000
the things we cannot talk about,

336
0:18:28.382,000 --> 0:18:3,000
political taboos, cultural taboos.

337
0:18:31.379,000 --> 0:18:34,000
We're also interested in our own silences.

338
0:18:35.38,000 --> 0:18:39,000
I have always been very vocal about and written extensively

339
0:18:39.495,000 --> 0:18:42,000
about minority rights, women's rights,

340
0:18:42.564,000 --> 0:18:43,000
LGBT rights.

341
0:18:44.62,000 --> 0:18:47,000
But as I was thinking about this TED Talk,

342
0:18:47.713,000 --> 0:18:48,000
I realized one thing:

343
0:18:49.3,000 --> 0:18:53,000
I have never had the courage to say in a public space

344
0:18:54.234,000 --> 0:18:57,000
that I was bisexual myself,

345
0:18:57.461,000 --> 0:19:,000
because I so feared the slander

346
0:19:00.612,000 --> 0:19:02,000
and the stigma and the ridicule

347
0:19:03.144,000 --> 0:19:05,000
and the hatred that was sure to follow.

348
0:19:06.62,000 --> 0:19:1,000
But of course, one should never, ever, remain silent

349
0:19:11.186,000 --> 0:19:13,000
for fear of complexity.

350
0:19:14.482,000 --> 0:19:18,000
(Applause)

351
0:19:22.323,000 --> 0:19:25,000
And although I am no stranger to anxieties,

352
0:19:25.65,000 --> 0:19:28,000
and although I am talking here about the power of emotions --

353
0:19:29.42,000 --> 0:19:31,000
I do know the power of emotions --

354
0:19:31.496,000 --> 0:19:32,000
I have discovered over time

355
0:19:33.447,000 --> 0:19:35,000
that emotions are not limitless.

356
0:19:35.621,000 --> 0:19:36,000
You know? They have a limit.

357
0:19:37.399,000 --> 0:19:38,000
There comes a moment --

358
0:19:38.698,000 --> 0:19:4,000
it's like a tipping point or a threshold --

359
0:19:40.845,000 --> 0:19:43,000
when you get tired of feeling afraid,

360
0:19:43.992,000 --> 0:19:45,000
when you get tired of feeling anxious.

361
0:19:46.688,000 --> 0:19:47,000
And I think not only individuals,

362
0:19:48.607,000 --> 0:19:52,000
but perhaps nations, too, have their own tipping points.

363
0:19:53.685,000 --> 0:19:55,000
So even stronger than my emotions

364
0:19:56.437,000 --> 0:19:57,000
is my awareness

365
0:19:58.362,000 --> 0:20:01,000
that not only gender, not only identity,

366
0:20:02.035,000 --> 0:20:04,000
but life itself is fluid.

367
0:20:05.471,000 --> 0:20:07,000
They want to divide us into tribes,

368
0:20:08.209,000 --> 0:20:1,000
but we are connected across borders.

369
0:20:11.211,000 --> 0:20:12,000
They preach certainty,

370
0:20:12.913,000 --> 0:20:15,000
but we know that life has plenty of magic

371
0:20:16.538,000 --> 0:20:18,000
and plenty of ambiguity.

372
0:20:18.608,000 --> 0:20:2,000
And they like to incite dualities,

373
0:20:21.423,000 --> 0:20:24,000
but we are far more nuanced than that.

374
0:20:25.38,000 --> 0:20:26,000
So what can we do?

375
0:20:26.923,000 --> 0:20:28,000
I think we need to go back to the basics,

376
0:20:29.265,000 --> 0:20:31,000
back to the colors of the alphabet.

377
0:20:32.037,000 --> 0:20:35,000
The Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran used to say,

378
0:20:35.821,000 --> 0:20:37,000
"I learned silence from the talkative

379
0:20:38.638,000 --> 0:20:4,000
and tolerance from the intolerant

380
0:20:41.102,000 --> 0:20:43,000
and kindness from the unkind."

381
0:20:43.972,000 --> 0:20:45,000
I think it's a great motto for our times.

382
0:20:47.094,000 --> 0:20:5,000
So from populist demagogues, we will learn

383
0:20:50.579,000 --> 0:20:52,000
the indispensability of democracy.

384
0:20:53.319,000 --> 0:20:57,000
And from isolationists, we will learn the need for global solidarity.

385
0:20:58.077,000 --> 0:21:03,000
And from tribalists, we will learn the beauty of cosmopolitanism

386
0:21:03.582,000 --> 0:21:05,000
and the beauty of diversity.

387
0:21:07.223,000 --> 0:21:12,000
As I finish, I want to leave you with one word, or one taste.

388
0:21:12.481,000 --> 0:21:15,000
The word "yurt" in Turkish means "motherland."

389
0:21:16.19,000 --> 0:21:17,000
It means "homeland."

390
0:21:17.885,000 --> 0:21:19,000
But interestingly, the word also means

391
0:21:20.188,000 --> 0:21:23,000
"a tent used by nomadic tribes."

392
0:21:23.966,000 --> 0:21:26,000
And I like that combination, because it makes me think

393
0:21:27.048,000 --> 0:21:31,000
homelands do not need to be rooted in one place.

394
0:21:31.148,000 --> 0:21:32,000
They can be portable.

395
0:21:32.636,000 --> 0:21:34,000
We can take them with us everywhere.

396
0:21:35.369,000 --> 0:21:37,000
And I think for writers, for storytellers,

397
0:21:38.316,000 --> 0:21:39,000
at the end of the day,

398
0:21:39.752,000 --> 0:21:41,000
there is one main homeland,

399
0:21:42.201,000 --> 0:21:44,000
and it's called "Storyland."

400
0:21:44.963,000 --> 0:21:46,000
And the taste of that word

401
0:21:47.287,000 --> 0:21:49,000
is the taste of freedom.

402
0:21:49.615,000 --> 0:21:5,000
Thank you.

403
0:21:50.942,000 --> 0:21:56,000
(Applause)

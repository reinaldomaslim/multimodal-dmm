1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
This technology

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
made a very important impact on us.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It changed the way our history developed.

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But it's a technology so pervasive,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
so invisible,

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that we, for a long time,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
forgot to take it into account

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
when we talked about

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
human evolution.

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But we see the results of this technology, still.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So let's make a little test.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So everyone of you turns to their neighbor please.

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Turn and face your neighbors.

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Please, also on the balcony.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Smile. Smile. Open the mouths.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Smile, friendly.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Do you --

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Do you see any Canine teeth?

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Count Dracula teeth

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in the mouths of your neighbors?

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Of course not.

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Because our dental anatomy

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
is actually made,

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
not for tearing down raw meat from bones

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
or chewing fibrous leaves for hours.

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
It is made for a diet

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
which is soft, mushy,

30
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
which is reduced in fibers,

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
which is very easily chewable

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and digestible.

33
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Sounds like fast food, doesn't it.

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It's for cooked food.

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
We carry in our face the proof

37
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that cooking,

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
food transformation,

39
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
made us what we are.

40
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So I would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves.

41
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
We talk about ourselves as omnivores.

42
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I would say, we should call ourselves coctivors --

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
from coquere, to cook.

45
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
We are the animals

46
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
who eat cooked food.

47
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
No, no, no, no. Better --

48
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
to live of cooked food.

49
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So cooking is a very important technology.

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It's technology.

51
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I don't know how you feel,

52
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
but I like to cook for entertainment.

53
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And you need some design

54
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to be successful.

55
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So, cooking is a very important technology,

56
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
because it allowed us to acquire

57
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
what brought you all here:

58
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
the big brain,

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
this wonderful cerebral cortex we have.

60
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Because brains are expensive.

61
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Those have to pay tuition fees know.

62
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

63
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But it's also, metabolically speaking, expensive.

64
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
You now, our brain is two to three percent of the body mass,

65
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use.

66
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It's very expensive.

67
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Where does the energy come from. Of course, from food.

68
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
If we eat raw food,

69
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
we cannot release really the energy.

70
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So this ingenuity of our ancestors,

71
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
to invent this most marvelous technology.

72
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Invisible -- everyone of us does it every day, so to speak.

73
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Cooking made it possible

74
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that mutations,

75
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
natural selections, our environment,

76
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
could develop us.

77
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So if we think about

78
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
this unleashing human potential,

79
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
which was possible by cooking and food,

80
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
why do we talk so badly about food?

81
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Why is it always do and don'ts

82
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and it's good for you, it's not good for you?

83
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I think the good news for me

84
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
would be if we could go back

85
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and talk about the unleashing,

86
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
the continuation of the unleashing of human potential.

87
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Now, cooking allowed also

88
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that we became a migrant species.

89
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We walked out of Africa two times.

90
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We populated all the ecologies.

91
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
If you can cook, nothing can happen to you,

92
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
because whatever you find,

93
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
you will try to transform it.

94
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It keeps also your brain working.

95
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Now the very easy and simple technology

96
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
which was developed

97
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
actually runs after this formula.

98
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Take something which looks like food, transform it,

99
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and it gives you a good, very easy, accessible energy.

100
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
This technology affected two organs,

101
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
the brain and the gut, which it actually affected.

102
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
The brain could grow, but the gut actually shrunk.

103
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Okay, it's not obvious to be honest.

104
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

105
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
But it shrunk to 60 percent

106
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
of primate gut

107
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
of my body mass.

108
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So because of having cooked food,

109
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
it's easier to digest.

110
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Now having a large brain, as you know,

111
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
is a big advantage,

112
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
because you can actually influence your environment.

113
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
You can influence your own technologies you have invented.

114
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
You can continue to innovate and invent.

115
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now the big brain did this also with cooking.

116
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But how did it actually run this show?

117
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
How did it actually interfere?

118
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
What kind of criteria did it use?

119
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And this is actually taste reward and energy.

120
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
You know we have up to five tastes,

121
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
three of them sustain us.

122
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Sweet -- energy.

123
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Umami -- this is a meaty taste.

124
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
You need proteins for muscles, recovery.

125
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Salty,

126
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
because you need salt, otherwise your electric body will not work.

127
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And two tastes which protect you --

128
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
bitter and sour,

129
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
which are against

130
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
poisonous and rotten material.

131
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But of course, they are hard-wired

132
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
but we use them still in a sophisticated way.

133
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Think about bittersweet chocolate;

134
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
or think about the acidity

135
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
of yogurt -- wonderful --

136
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
mixed with strawberry fruits.

137
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing

138
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
because we know

139
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that, in cooking, we can transform it

140
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
to the form.

141
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Reward: this is a more complex

142
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and especially integrative

143
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
form of our brain

144
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
with various different elements --

145
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the external states, our internal states,

146
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
how do we feel, and so on are put together.

147
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And something which maybe you don't like

148
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
but you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat.

149
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So satisfaction was a very important part.

150
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And as I say, energy was necessary.

151
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Now how did the gut actually

152
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
participate in this development?

153
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And the gut is a silent voice --

154
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
it's going more for feelings.

155
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I use the euphemism digestive comfort --

156
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
actually -- it's a digestive discomfort,

157
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
which the gut is concerned with.

158
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
If you get a stomach ache, if you get a little bit bloated,

159
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
was not the right food, was not the right cooking manipulation

160
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
or maybe other things went wrong.

161
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So my story is a tale of two brains,

162
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
because it might surprise you,

163
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
our gut has a full-fledged brain.

164
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
All the managers in the room say,

165
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
"You don't tell me something new, because we know, gut feeling.

166
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
This is what we are using."

167
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Laughter)

168
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And actually you use it and it's actually useful.

169
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Because our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system,

170
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
they do speak with each other

171
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and make decisions.

172
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But what it means

173
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to have a brain there

174
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
is that, not only the big brain

175
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
has to talk with the food,

176
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
the food has to talk with the brain,

177
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
because we have to learn actually

178
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
how to talk to the brains.

179
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Now if there's a gut brain,

180
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
we should also learn to talk with this brain.

181
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Now 150 years ago,

182
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
anatomists described very, very carefully --

183
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
here is a model of a wall of a gut.

184
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I took the three elements --

185
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
stomach, small intestine and colon.

186
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And within this structure,

187
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
you see these two pinkish layers,

188
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
which are actually the muscle.

189
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And between this muscle, they found nervous tissues,

190
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
a lot of nervous tissues,

191
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
which penetrate actually the muscle --

192
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
penetrate the submucosa,

193
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
where you have all the elements for the immune system.

194
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
The gut is actually the largest immune system,

195
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
defending your body.

196
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
It penetrates the mucosa.

197
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
This is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing

198
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and you digest,

199
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
which is actually the lumen.

200
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Now if you think about the gut,

201
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
the gut is -- if you could stretch it --

202
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
40 meters long,

203
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
the length of a tennis court.

204
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
If we could unroll it,

205
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
get out all the folds and so on,

206
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
it would have 400 sq. meters of surface.

207
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And now this brain takes care over this,

208
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface

209
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and, of course, digest our food we cook.

210
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So if we give you a specification,

211
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
this brain, which is autonomous,

212
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
have 500 million nerve cells,

213
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
100 million neurons --

214
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
so around the size of a cat brain,

215
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
so there sleeps a little cat --

216
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
thinks for itself,

217
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
optimizes whatever it digests.

218
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It has 20 different neuron types.

219
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
It's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain,

220
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
where you have 100 billion neurons.

221
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
It has autonomous organized microcircuits,

222
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
has these programs which run.

223
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
It senses the food; it knows exactly what to do.

224
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
It senses it by chemical means

225
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and very importantly by mechanical means,

226
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
because it has to move the food --

227
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
it has to mix all the various elements

228
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
which we need for digestion.

229
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
This control of muscle is very, very important,

230
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
because, you know, there can be reflexes.

231
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
If you don't like a food, especially if you're a child, you gag.

232
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It's this brain which makes this reflex.

233
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And then finally,

234
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery,

235
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
which actually digests the food we cook.

236
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Now how do the two brains work with each other?

237
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I took here a model from robotics --

238
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
it's called the Subsumption Architecture.

239
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
What it means is that we have a layered control system.

240
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
The lower layer, our gut brain,

241
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
has its own goals -- digestion defense --

242
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and we have the higher brain

243
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
with the goal of integration

244
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and generating behaviors.

245
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Now both look -- and this is the blue arrows --

246
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
both look to the same food, which is in the lumen

247
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and in the area of your intestine.

248
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
The big brain integrates signals,

249
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
which come from the running programs

250
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
of the lower brain,

251
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
But subsumption means

252
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that the higher brain can interfere with the lower.

253
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It can replace,

254
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
or it can inhibit actually, signals.

255
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So if we take two types of signals --

256
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
a hunger signal for example.

257
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
If you have an empty stomach,

258
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin.

259
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
It's a very big signal;

260
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
it's sent to the brain says,

261
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
"Go and eat."

262
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
You have stop signals --

263
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
we have up to eight stop signals.

264
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
At least in my case,

265
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
they are not listened to.

266
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
(Laughter)

267
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So what happens

268
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
if the big brain in the integration

269
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
overrides the signal?

270
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So if you override the hunger signal,

271
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
you can have a disorder, which is called anorexia.

272
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Despite generating

273
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
a healthy hunger signal,

274
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
the big brain ignores it

275
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and activates different programs in the gut.

276
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
The more usual case

277
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
is overeating.

278
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
It actually takes the signal

279
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and changes it,

280
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and we continue,

281
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
even [though] our eight signals would say, "Stop, enough.

282
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
We have transferred enough energy."

283
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
Now the interesting thing is that,

284
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
along this lower layer -- this gut --

285
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
the signal becomes stronger and stronger

286
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
if undigested, but digestible, material

287
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
could penetrate.

288
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
This we found from bariatric surgery.

289
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
That then the signal would be very, very high.

290
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
So now back to the cooking question

291
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and back to the design.

292
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
We have learned to talk to the big brain --

293
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
taste and reward, as you know.

294
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Now what would be the language

295
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
we have to talk to the gut brain

296
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
that its signals are so strong

297
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that the big brain cannot ignore it?

298
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Then we would generate something

299
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
all of us would like to have --

300
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
a balance between the hunger

301
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and the satiation.

302
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Now I give you, from our research, a very short claim.

303
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
This is fat digestion.

304
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
You have on your left

305
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
an olive oil droplet,

306
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes.

307
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
This is an in vitro experiment.

308
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It's very difficult to work in the intestine.

309
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Now everyone would expect

310
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
that when the degradation of the oil happens,

311
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
when the constituents are liberated,

312
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
they disappear, they go away

313
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
because they [were] absorbed.

314
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Actually, what happens is that a very intricate structure appears.

315
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And I hope you can see

316
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that there are some ring-like structures in the middle image,

317
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
which is water.

318
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
This whole system generates a huge surface

319
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
to allow more enzymes

320
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
to attack the remaining oil.

321
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And finally, on your right side,

322
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
you see a bubbly,

323
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
cell-like structure appearing,

324
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
from which the body will absorb the fat.

325
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Now if we could take this language --

326
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and this is a language of structures --

327
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and make it longer-lasting,

328
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
that it can go through

329
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
the passage of the intestine,

330
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
it would generate stronger signals.

331
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
So our research --

332
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and I think the research also at the universities --

333
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
are now fixing on these points

334
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
to say: how can we actually --

335
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and this might sound trivial now to you --

336
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
how can we change cooking?

337
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
How can we cook

338
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
that we have this language developed?

339
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
So what we have actually, it's not an omnivore's dilemma.

340
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
We have a coctivor's opportunity,

341
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
because we have learned over the last two million years

342
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
which taste and reward --

343
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
quite sophisticated to cook --

344
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
to please ourselves, to satisfy ourselves.

345
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
If we add the matrix,

346
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
if we add the structure language, which we have to learn,

347
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
when we learn it, then we can put it back;

348
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and around energy,

349
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
we could generate a balance,

350
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
which comes out

351
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
from our really primordial operation: cooking.

352
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
So, to make cooking really

353
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
a very important element,

354
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
I would say even philosophers have to change

355
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and have to finally recognize

356
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
that cooking is what made us.

357
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
So I would say, coquo ergo sum:

358
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
I cook, therefore I am.

359
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Thank you very much.

360
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000

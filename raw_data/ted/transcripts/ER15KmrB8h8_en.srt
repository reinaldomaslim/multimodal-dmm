0:00:13.125,000 --> 0:00:16,000
In 2015, 25 teams from around the world

3
0:00:17.042,000 --> 0:00:19,000
competed to build robots for disaster response

4
0:00:19.792,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that could perform a number of tasks,

5
0:00:21.667,000 --> 0:00:22,000
such as using a power tool,

6
0:00:23.333,000 --> 0:00:24,000
working on uneven terrain

7
0:00:25.042,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and driving a car.

8
0:00:27.292,000 --> 0:00:29,000
That all sounds impressive, and it is,

9
0:00:30.458,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but look at the body of the winning robot, HUBO.

10
0:00:34.208,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Here, HUBO is trying to get out of a car,

11
0:00:36.542,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and keep in mind,

12
0:00:38.292,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the video is sped up three times.

13
0:00:40.083,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:44.75,000 --> 0:00:46,000
HUBO, from team KAIST out of Korea, is a state-of-the-art robot

15
0:00:47.75,000 --> 0:00:48,000
with impressive capabilities,

16
0:00:49.542,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but this body doesn't look all that different

17
0:00:51.708,000 --> 0:00:52,000
from robots we've seen a few decades ago.

18
0:00:54.625,000 --> 0:00:56,000
If you look at the other robots in the competition,

19
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:01,000
their movements also still look, well, very robotic.

20
0:01:01.125,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Their bodies are complex mechanical structures

21
0:01:03.375,000 --> 0:01:04,000
using rigid materials

22
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:08,000
such as metal and traditional rigid electric motors.

23
0:01:08.625,000 --> 0:01:09,000
They certainly weren't designed

24
0:01:10.25,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to be low-cost, safe near people

25
0:01:13.333,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and adaptable to unpredictable challenges.

26
0:01:16.208,000 --> 0:01:18,000
We've made good progress with the brains of robots,

27
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but their bodies are still primitive.

28
0:01:22.625,000 --> 0:01:24,000
This is my daughter Nadia.

29
0:01:24.667,000 --> 0:01:25,000
She's only five years old

30
0:01:26.417,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and she can get out of the car way faster than HUBO.

31
0:01:28.917,000 --> 0:01:29,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:30.708,000 --> 0:01:32,000
She can also swing around on monkey bars with ease,

33
0:01:33.125,000 --> 0:01:36,000
much better than any current human-like robot could do.

34
0:01:36.292,000 --> 0:01:37,000
In contrast to HUBO,

35
0:01:37.667,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the human body makes extensive use of soft and deformable materials

36
0:01:41.417,000 --> 0:01:42,000
such as muscle and skin.

37
0:01:43.375,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We need a new generation of robot bodies

38
0:01:45.75,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that is inspired by the elegance, efficiency and by the soft materials

39
0:01:49.875,000 --> 0:01:5,000
of the designs found in nature.

40
0:01:52.292,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And indeed, this has become the key idea of a new field of research

41
0:01:56.542,000 --> 0:01:57,000
called soft robotics.

42
0:01:58.5,000 --> 0:02:,000
My research group and collaborators around the world

43
0:02:01.417,000 --> 0:02:04,000
are using soft components inspired by muscle and skin

44
0:02:05.083,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to build robots with agility and dexterity

45
0:02:07.917,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that comes closer and closer

46
0:02:09.583,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to the astonishing capabilities of the organisms found in nature.

47
0:02:14.458,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I've always been particularly inspired by biological muscle.

48
0:02:18.167,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now, that's not surprising.

49
0:02:20.333,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I'm also Austrian, and I know that I sound a bit like Arnie, the Terminator.

50
0:02:23.958,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Biological muscle is a true masterpiece of evolution.

52
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It can heal after damage

53
0:02:31.583,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and it's tightly integrated with sensory neurons

54
0:02:34.042,000 --> 0:02:36,000
for feedback on motion and the environment.

55
0:02:37.083,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It can contract fast enough to power the high-speed wings

56
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:41,000
of a hummingbird;

57
0:02:41.292,000 --> 0:02:43,000
it can grow strong enough to move an elephant;

58
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and it's adaptable enough to be used in the extremely versatile arms

59
0:02:47.583,000 --> 0:02:48,000
of an octopus,

60
0:02:48.917,000 --> 0:02:51,000
an animal that can squeeze its entire body through tiny holes.

61
0:02:53.25,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Actuators are for robots what muscles are for animals:

62
0:02:57.167,000 --> 0:02:58,000
key components of the body

63
0:02:59.042,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that enable movement and interaction with the world.

64
0:03:02.667,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So if we could build soft actuators,

65
0:03:05.167,000 --> 0:03:06,000
or artificial muscles,

66
0:03:06.625,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that are as versatile, adaptable

67
0:03:08.25,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and could have the same performance as the real thing,

68
0:03:10.833,000 --> 0:03:11,000
we could build almost any type of robot

69
0:03:12.792,000 --> 0:03:13,000
for almost any type of use.

70
0:03:15.167,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Not surprisingly, people have tried for many decades

71
0:03:18.375,000 --> 0:03:2,000
to replicate the astonishing capabilities of muscle,

72
0:03:21.292,000 --> 0:03:22,000
but it's been really hard.

73
0:03:24.583,000 --> 0:03:25,000
About 10 years ago,

74
0:03:26.083,000 --> 0:03:28,000
when I did my PhD back in Austria,

75
0:03:28.833,000 --> 0:03:3,000
my colleagues and I rediscovered

76
0:03:30.958,000 --> 0:03:34,000
what is likely one of the very first publications on artificial muscle,

77
0:03:35.125,000 --> 0:03:36,000
published in 1880.

78
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:4,000
"On the shape and volume changes of dielectric bodies

79
0:03:40.167,000 --> 0:03:41,000
caused by electricity,"

80
0:03:41.708,000 --> 0:03:44,000
published by German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen.

81
0:03:44.833,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Most of you know him as the discoverer of the X-ray.

82
0:03:49.292,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Following his instructions, we used a pair of needles.

83
0:03:51.875,000 --> 0:03:52,000
We connected it to a high-voltage source,

84
0:03:53.833,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and we placed it near a transparent piece of rubber

85
0:03:56.313,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that was prestretched onto a plastic frame.

86
0:03:59.333,000 --> 0:04:,000
When we switched on the voltage,

87
0:04:01.042,000 --> 0:04:02,000
the rubber deformed,

88
0:04:02.375,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and just like our biceps flexes our arm,

89
0:04:05.583,000 --> 0:04:07,000
the rubber flexed the plastic frame.

90
0:04:08.25,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It looks like magic.

91
0:04:09.583,000 --> 0:04:11,000
The needles don't even touch the rubber.

92
0:04:11.958,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Now, having two such needles is not a practical way

93
0:04:14.5,000 --> 0:04:16,000
of operating artificial muscles,

94
0:04:16.667,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but this amazing experiment got me hooked on the topic.

95
0:04:19.833,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I wanted to create new ways to build artificial muscles

96
0:04:22.875,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that would work well for real-world applications.

97
0:04:25.708,000 --> 0:04:28,000
For the next years, I worked on a number of different technologies

98
0:04:29.458,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that all showed promise,

99
0:04:30.791,000 --> 0:04:33,000
but they all had remaining challenges that are hard to overcome.

100
0:04:34.833,000 --> 0:04:35,000
In 2015,

101
0:04:36.458,000 --> 0:04:38,000
when I started my own lab at CU Boulder,

102
0:04:38.875,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I wanted to try an entirely new idea.

103
0:04:41.125,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I wanted to combine the high speed and efficiency

104
0:04:44.042,000 --> 0:04:45,000
of electrically driven actuators

105
0:04:46.042,000 --> 0:04:48,000
with the versatility of soft, fluidic actuators.

106
0:04:49.458,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Therefore, I thought,

107
0:04:50.792,000 --> 0:04:53,000
maybe I can try using really old science in a new way.

108
0:04:54.167,000 --> 0:04:55,000
The diagram you see here

109
0:04:55.958,000 --> 0:04:57,000
shows an effect called Maxwell stress.

110
0:04:58.542,000 --> 0:04:59,000
When you take two metal plates

111
0:05:00.042,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and place them in a container filled with oil,

112
0:05:02.25,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and then switch on a voltage,

113
0:05:03.917,000 --> 0:05:06,000
the Maxwell stress forces the oil up in between the two plates,

114
0:05:07.875,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and that's what you see here.

115
0:05:09.375,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So the key idea was,

116
0:05:10.75,000 --> 0:05:12,000
can we use this effect to push around oil

117
0:05:13.708,000 --> 0:05:15,000
contained in soft stretchy structures?

118
0:05:16.542,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And indeed, this worked surprisingly well,

119
0:05:18.917,000 --> 0:05:2,000
quite honestly, much better than I expected.

120
0:05:21.625,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Together with my outstanding team of students,

121
0:05:23.833,000 --> 0:05:24,000
we used this idea as a starting point

122
0:05:25.75,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to develop a new technology called HASEL artificial muscles.

123
0:05:29.917,000 --> 0:05:32,000
HASELs are gentle enough to pick up a raspberry

124
0:05:33.042,000 --> 0:05:34,000
without damaging it.

125
0:05:36.542,000 --> 0:05:39,000
They can expand and contract like real muscle.

126
0:05:41.625,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And they can be operated faster than the real thing.

127
0:05:44.958,000 --> 0:05:46,000
They can also be scaled up to deliver large forces.

128
0:05:47.625,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Here you see them lifting a gallon filled with water.

129
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:52,000
They can be used to drive a robotic arm,

130
0:05:52.958,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and they can even self-sense their position.

131
0:05:57.292,000 --> 0:05:59,000
HASELs can be used for very precise movement,

132
0:06:01.292,000 --> 0:06:03,000
but they can also deliver very fluidic, muscle-like movement

133
0:06:04.167,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and bursts of power to shoot up a ball into the air.

134
0:06:09.375,000 --> 0:06:1,000
When submerged in oil,

135
0:06:12.667,000 --> 0:06:15,000
HASEL artificial muscles can be made invisible.

136
0:06:19.875,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So how do HASEL artificial muscles work?

137
0:06:22.542,000 --> 0:06:23,000
You might be surprised.

138
0:06:24.25,000 --> 0:06:27,000
They're based on very inexpensive, easily available materials.

139
0:06:27.458,000 --> 0:06:29,000
You can even try, and I recommend it,

140
0:06:29.75,000 --> 0:06:3,000
the main principle at home.

141
0:06:31.875,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Take a few Ziploc bags and fill them with olive oil.

142
0:06:34.667,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Try to push out air bubbles as much as you can.

143
0:06:37.583,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Now take a glass plate and place it on one side of the bag.

144
0:06:40.708,000 --> 0:06:42,000
When you press down, you see the bag contract.

145
0:06:43.792,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Now the amount of contraction is easy to control.

146
0:06:47.167,000 --> 0:06:49,000
When you take a small weight, you get a small contraction.

147
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
With a medium weight, we get a medium contraction.

148
0:06:54.125,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And with a large weight, you get a large contraction.

149
0:06:57.042,000 --> 0:07:,000
Now for HASELs, the only change is to replace the force of your hand

150
0:07:00.5,000 --> 0:07:03,000
or the weight with an electrical force.

151
0:07:03.542,000 --> 0:07:08,000
HASEL stands for "hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic actuators."

152
0:07:08.917,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Here you see a geometry called Peano-HASEL actuators,

153
0:07:12.125,000 --> 0:07:14,000
one of many possible designs.

154
0:07:15.083,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Again, you take a flexible polymer such as our Ziploc bag,

155
0:07:18.708,000 --> 0:07:2,000
you fill it with an insulating liquid, such as olive oil,

156
0:07:21.667,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and now, instead of the glass plate,

157
0:07:23.458,000 --> 0:07:25,000
you place an electrical conductor on one side of the pouch.

158
0:07:26.958,000 --> 0:07:28,000
To create something that looks more like a muscle fiber,

159
0:07:29.625,000 --> 0:07:3,000
you can connect a few pouches together

160
0:07:31.625,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and attached a weight on one side.

161
0:07:33.792,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Next, we apply voltage.

162
0:07:36.083,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Now, the electric field starts acting on the liquid.

163
0:07:39.417,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It displaces the liquid,

164
0:07:41.125,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and it forces the muscle to contract.

165
0:07:44.708,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Here you see a completed Peano-HASEL actuator

166
0:07:47.208,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and how it expands and contracts when voltage is applied.

167
0:07:51.125,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Viewed from the side,

168
0:07:52.458,000 --> 0:07:55,000
you can really see those pouches take a more cylindrical shape,

169
0:07:55.708,000 --> 0:07:56,000
such as we saw with the Ziploc bags.

170
0:07:58.5,000 --> 0:08:01,000
We can also place a few such muscle fibers next to each other

171
0:08:01.75,000 --> 0:08:03,000
to create something that looks even more like a muscle

172
0:08:04.333,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that also contracts and expands in cross section.

173
0:08:06.792,000 --> 0:08:09,000
These HASELs here are lifting a weight that's about 200 times heavier

174
0:08:10.167,000 --> 0:08:11,000
than their own weight.

175
0:08:12.667,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Here you see one of our newest designs, called quadrant donut HASELs

176
0:08:16.167,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and how they expand and contract.

177
0:08:17.792,000 --> 0:08:2,000
They can be operated incredibly fast, reaching superhuman speeds.

178
0:08:23.333,000 --> 0:08:25,000
They are even powerful enough to jump off the ground.

179
0:08:26.333,000 --> 0:08:27,000
(Laughter)

180
0:08:28.917,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Overall, HASELs show promise to become the first technology

181
0:08:32.458,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that matches or exceeds the performance of biological muscle

182
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:39,000
while being compatible with large-scale manufacturing.

183
0:08:39.167,000 --> 0:08:42,000
This is also a very young technology. We are just getting started.

184
0:08:42.333,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We have many ideas how to drastically improve performance,

185
0:08:45.125,000 --> 0:08:48,000
using new materials and new designs to reach a level of performance

186
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:53,000
beyond biological muscle and also beyond traditional rigid electric motors.

187
0:08:54.25,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Moving towards more complex designs of HASEL for bio-inspired robotics,

188
0:08:57.667,000 --> 0:08:58,000
here you see our artificial scorpion

189
0:08:59.458,000 --> 0:09:,000
that can use its tail to hunt prey,

190
0:09:01.208,000 --> 0:09:02,000
in this case, a rubber balloon.

191
0:09:02.75,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Laughter)

192
0:09:04.417,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Going back to our initial inspiration,

193
0:09:06.542,000 --> 0:09:08,000
the versatility of octopus arms and elephant trunks,

194
0:09:09.375,000 --> 0:09:11,000
we are now able to build soft continuum actuators

195
0:09:12.167,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that come closer and closer to the capabilities of the real thing.

196
0:09:17.833,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I am most excited about the practical applications

197
0:09:20.75,000 --> 0:09:21,000
of HASEL artificial muscles.

198
0:09:22.583,000 --> 0:09:24,000
They'll enable soft robotic devices

199
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that can improve the quality of life.

200
0:09:27.375,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Soft robotics will enable a new generation of more lifelike prosthetics

201
0:09:31.208,000 --> 0:09:33,000
for people who have lost parts of their bodies.

202
0:09:33.458,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Here you see some HASELs in my lab,

203
0:09:35.292,000 --> 0:09:37,000
early testing, driving a prosthetic finger.

204
0:09:39.542,000 --> 0:09:42,000
One day, we may even merge our bodies with robotic parts.

205
0:09:45.125,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I know that sounds very scary at first.

206
0:09:48.917,000 --> 0:09:49,000
But when I think about my grandparents

207
0:09:50.792,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and the way they become more dependent on others

208
0:09:53.75,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to perform simple everyday tasks such as using the restroom alone,

209
0:09:57.875,000 --> 0:09:59,000
they often feel like they're becoming a burden.

210
0:10:00.958,000 --> 0:10:03,000
With soft robotics, we will be able to enhance and restore

211
0:10:04.25,000 --> 0:10:05,000
agility and dexterity,

212
0:10:05.875,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and thereby help older people maintain autonomy

213
0:10:08.792,000 --> 0:10:1,000
for longer parts of their lives.

214
0:10:11.083,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Maybe we can call that "robotics for antiaging"

215
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:17,000
or even a next stage of human evolution.

216
0:10:19.083,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Unlike their traditional rigid counterparts,

217
0:10:21.958,000 --> 0:10:25,000
soft life-like robots will safely operate near people and help us at home.

218
0:10:27.667,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Soft robotics is a very young field. We're just getting started.

219
0:10:31.083,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I hope that many young people from many different backgrounds

220
0:10:34.208,000 --> 0:10:35,000
join us on this exciting journey

221
0:10:36.083,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and help shape the future of robotics

222
0:10:38.25,000 --> 0:10:4,000
by introducing new concepts inspired by nature.

223
0:10:42.708,000 --> 0:10:43,000
If we do this right,

224
0:10:44.333,000 --> 0:10:45,000
we can improve the quality of life

225
0:10:46.125,000 --> 0:10:47,000
for all of us.

226
0:10:47.458,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Thank you.

227
0:10:48.75,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Who here is fascinated by life under the sea?

2
0:00:18.96,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Fantastic.

3
0:00:20.36,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Now, what did we just do?

4
0:00:22.76,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Let's dissect this for a second.

5
0:00:24.6,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The simple action of an individual raising a hand

6
0:00:28.12,000 --> 0:00:29,000
led many others to do the same.

7
0:00:30.88,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Now, it's true that when individuals in a social network

8
0:00:34.24,000 --> 0:00:35,000
have common priorities,

9
0:00:35.84,000 --> 0:00:37,000
it's often beneficial to copy one another.

10
0:00:38.84,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Think back to grade school and dressing like the cool kids made you "cool."

11
0:00:42.72,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But copying behavior is also common in wild animals.

12
0:00:46.44,000 --> 0:00:49,000
For example, some birds copy the alarm calls of other birds

13
0:00:50.2,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to spread information about approaching predators.

14
0:00:53.92,000 --> 0:00:56,000
But could copying behavior in wild animals

15
0:00:57.2,000 --> 0:01:,000
affect entire ecosystems that we humans depend on?

16
0:01:02.04,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I was led to this question while studying coral reefs,

17
0:01:04.64,000 --> 0:01:07,000
which support millions of people through fisheries and tourism

18
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
here in Africa and around the world.

19
0:01:10.76,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But coral reefs depend on fish

20
0:01:14.04,000 --> 0:01:17,000
that perform a critical job by eating algae.

21
0:01:17.64,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Because if left unchecked,

22
0:01:18.92,000 --> 0:01:21,000
these algae can kill coral and take over entire coral reefs,

23
0:01:22.84,000 --> 0:01:26,000
a costly change that is difficult or impossible to reverse.

24
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So to understand how fish may prevent this,

25
0:01:31.2,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I spy on them

26
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
while they're eating algae,

27
0:01:35.24,000 --> 0:01:37,000
which can be difficult for them to do

28
0:01:37.32,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in open parts of the reef exposed to predators,

29
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
some of which, on rare occasion,

30
0:01:42.96,000 --> 0:01:44,000
appear to realize I'm watching them.

31
0:01:45.88,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:52.28,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So clearly, clearly, for reef fish,

33
0:01:55.36,000 --> 0:01:57,000
dining out can be scary.

34
0:01:57.72,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But I wanted to understand how these fish do their job

35
0:02:00.28,000 --> 0:02:01,000
in risky situations.

36
0:02:01.88,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So my colleagues and I put massive video camera stands

37
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in a coral reef

38
0:02:07.52,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to remotely monitor entire feeding grounds

39
0:02:10.24,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that produce a lot of algae

40
0:02:11.84,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but are exposed to predators.

41
0:02:15.56,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And this perspective from above

42
0:02:17.72,000 --> 0:02:2,000
shows us the feeding behavior and precise movements

43
0:02:21.24,000 --> 0:02:22,000
of many different fish,

44
0:02:22.84,000 --> 0:02:23,000
shown here with colored dots.

45
0:02:25.24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And by analyzing thousands of fish movements

46
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to and from feeding grounds,

47
0:02:30.4,000 --> 0:02:31,000
we discovered a pattern.

48
0:02:32.68,000 --> 0:02:34,000
These fish, despite being from different species

49
0:02:35.36,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and not swimming in schools,

50
0:02:37.2,000 --> 0:02:39,000
were copying one another,

51
0:02:39.24,000 --> 0:02:42,000
such that one fish entering these dangerous feeding grounds

52
0:02:42.48,000 --> 0:02:44,000
could lead many others to do the same.

53
0:02:45.32,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And fish stayed for longer and ate more algae

54
0:02:48.28,000 --> 0:02:51,000
when they were surrounded by more feeding fish.

55
0:02:51.32,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Now, this could be happening

56
0:02:53.28,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because even simple movements by individual fish

57
0:02:55.88,000 --> 0:02:58,000
can inadvertently communicate vital information.

58
0:02:59.88,000 --> 0:03:02,000
For example, if even one fish sees a predator and flees,

59
0:03:03.88,000 --> 0:03:05,000
this can alert many others to danger.

60
0:03:06.64,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And a fish safely entering feeding grounds can show others that the coast is clear.

61
0:03:11.32,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So it turns out that even when these fish are different species,

62
0:03:15.36,000 --> 0:03:18,000
they are connected within social networks

63
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:22,000
which can provide information on when it's safe to eat.

64
0:03:22.84,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And our analyses indicate that fish simply copying other fish in their social network

65
0:03:27.84,000 --> 0:03:32,000
could account for over 60 percent of the algae eaten by the fish community,

66
0:03:32.92,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and thus could be critical to the flow of energy and resources

67
0:03:37.96,000 --> 0:03:39,000
through coral reef ecosystems.

68
0:03:40.68,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But these findings also suggest that overfishing,

69
0:03:43.28,000 --> 0:03:44,000
a common problem in coral reefs,

70
0:03:45.28,000 --> 0:03:47,000
not only removes fish,

71
0:03:47.76,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but it could break up the social network of remaining fish,

72
0:03:50.84,000 --> 0:03:52,000
which may hide more and eat less algae

73
0:03:53.64,000 --> 0:03:55,000
because they're missing critical information.

74
0:03:56.2,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And this would make coral reefs more vulnerable than we currently predict.

75
0:04:02.04,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So remarkably, fish social networks

76
0:04:06.4,000 --> 0:04:08,000
allow the actions of one to spread to many

77
0:04:09.32,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and could affect entire coral reefs,

78
0:04:11.28,000 --> 0:04:14,000
which feed millions of us

79
0:04:14.56,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and support the global economy

80
0:04:16.36,000 --> 0:04:17,000
for all of us.

81
0:04:18.44,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Now, our discovery points us towards better ways

82
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to sustainably manage coral reefs,

83
0:04:23.36,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but it also shows us,

84
0:04:24.96,000 --> 0:04:28,000
we humans are not just affected by the actions of other humans,

85
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but we could be affected by the actions of individual fish

86
0:04:32.079,000 --> 0:04:33,000
on a distant coral reef

87
0:04:33.88,000 --> 0:04:35,000
through their simple copying behavior.

88
0:04:36.36,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Thank you.

89
0:04:37.6,000 --> 0:04:41,000

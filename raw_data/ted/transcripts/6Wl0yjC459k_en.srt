1
0:00:13.507,000 --> 0:00:16,000
It's been about a decade since the last financial crisis,

2
0:00:16.776,000 --> 0:00:18,000
yet this industry has never been bigger.

3
0:00:19.725,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Legislation that was meant to better regulate its largest players

4
0:00:23.289,000 --> 0:00:24,000
has hurt its smaller ones,

5
0:00:24.874,000 --> 0:00:29,000
resulting in most of the industry's assets to be controlled by the top one percent.

6
0:00:30.55,000 --> 0:00:31,000
They've become too big to fail.

7
0:00:33.386,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I'm not referring to big banks,

8
0:00:35.613,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but the world of Big Agriculture.

9
0:00:39.47,000 --> 0:00:4,000
As a public health practitioner

10
0:00:40.99,000 --> 0:00:42,000
who has worked with small-scale farmers in Rwanda

11
0:00:43.722,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and now as a small food business owner

12
0:00:46.25,000 --> 0:00:49,000
who sits at the intersection between our consumers and producers,

13
0:00:50.201,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I've been exposed to one of the most

14
0:00:51.96,000 --> 0:00:54,000
ecologically and economically intensive industries in the world,

15
0:00:55.408,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and throughout my work,

16
0:00:56.712,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I've witnessed a chilling irony.

17
0:00:59.881,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Our farmers, who feed our communities, cannot afford the very foods they grow.

18
0:01:06.927,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Today, a handful of corporations continue to consolidate

19
0:01:10.791,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the entire food supply chain,

20
0:01:13.095,000 --> 0:01:16,000
from the intellectual property of seeds to produce and livestock

21
0:01:16.918,000 --> 0:01:19,000
all the way to the financial institutions who lend to these farmers.

22
0:01:21.268,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And the recent results have been rising bankruptcies for family farms

23
0:01:25.917,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and little control for those who are just trying to survive in the industry.

24
0:01:30.931,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Left unchecked, we will head into another economic collapse,

25
0:01:35.095,000 --> 0:01:38,000
one very similar to the farm crisis of the 1980s,

26
0:01:38.464,000 --> 0:01:4,000
when commodity market prices crashed,

27
0:01:40.721,000 --> 0:01:41,000
interest rates doubled,

28
0:01:42.383,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and many farmers lost everything.

29
0:01:45.67,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Fortunately, there's a very simple, three-part solution

30
0:01:50.129,000 --> 0:01:52,000
you can be part of right now

31
0:01:52.878,000 --> 0:01:55,000
to help us transform our food industry from the bottom up.

32
0:01:58.47,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Step one: shop at your local farmers markets.

33
0:02:03.181,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Buying from your local market

34
0:02:04.762,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and subscribing to a community-supported agricultural produce box,

35
0:02:09.346,000 --> 0:02:1,000
better known as a CSA,

36
0:02:11.275,000 --> 0:02:13,000
may be the single greatest purchasing decision you can make

37
0:02:14.273,000 --> 0:02:15,000
as a consumer today.

38
0:02:16.21,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Last year, American farmers made the least they have

39
0:02:19.536,000 --> 0:02:21,000
in almost three decades,

40
0:02:21.843,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because they now own fewer parts of the supply chain

41
0:02:24.898,000 --> 0:02:25,000
than ever before.

42
0:02:27.018,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Under exclusive contracts with Big Ag and big box stores,

43
0:02:30.67,000 --> 0:02:33,000
farmers are not offered a fair price for their goods.

44
0:02:34.559,000 --> 0:02:36,000
In fact, the average farmer in America

45
0:02:37.301,000 --> 0:02:43,000
makes less than 15 cents of every dollar on a product that you purchase at a store.

46
0:02:44.877,000 --> 0:02:48,000
On the other hand, farmers who sell their goods at a farmers market

47
0:02:48.967,000 --> 0:02:5,000
take home closer to 90 cents of every dollar.

48
0:02:52.412,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But beyond taking home a larger share,

49
0:02:55.019,000 --> 0:02:57,000
farmers use markets as an opportunity

50
0:02:57.567,000 --> 0:02:59,000
to cultivate the next generation of agriculturalists

51
0:03:00.304,000 --> 0:03:03,000
who shepherd our farmlands and our pastures.

52
0:03:03.393,000 --> 0:03:07,000
In our fight against climate change, we need them now more than ever

53
0:03:07.439,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to promote and preserve diverse land use.

54
0:03:10.96,000 --> 0:03:13,000
When multigenerational farms are lost to Big Ag consolidation,

55
0:03:14.925,000 --> 0:03:16,000
our communities suffer in countless ways.

56
0:03:17.814,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Rural America has now jumped above the national average in violent crime.

57
0:03:23.153,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Three out four farmworkers surveyed have been directly impacted

58
0:03:26.776,000 --> 0:03:27,000
by our opioid epidemic.

59
0:03:28.644,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Now oftentimes disguised as accidents,

60
0:03:31.55,000 --> 0:03:33,000
farmer suicide is now on the rise.

61
0:03:35.971,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Step two: shop at your local farmers markets.

62
0:03:40.63,000 --> 0:03:41,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:43.454,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Produce from a large retail store is harvested before it's ripe

64
0:03:47.84,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to travel more than a thousand miles before it ultimately sits on your shelf

65
0:03:51.723,000 --> 0:03:52,000
roughly two weeks later.

66
0:03:53.502,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Alternatively, because most farmers markets

67
0:03:55.821,000 --> 0:03:57,000
have proximity and production requirements,

68
0:03:58.646,000 --> 0:04:02,000
farmers travel less than 50 miles to offer you local produce

69
0:04:03.404,000 --> 0:04:05,000
with minimal packaging waste.

70
0:04:06.363,000 --> 0:04:1,000
With the advent of online grocers and trending meal kits,

71
0:04:11.076,000 --> 0:04:13,000
consumers are increasingly disconnected

72
0:04:13.627,000 --> 0:04:15,000
with their farmers and the economics of food production.

73
0:04:16.906,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Since the rise of the smartphone revolution,

74
0:04:19.245,000 --> 0:04:21,000
direct-to-consumer goods have stagnated.

75
0:04:24.081,000 --> 0:04:29,000
While local and sustainable foods have been trending for almost a decade,

76
0:04:29.232,000 --> 0:04:3,000
terms like "healthy" and "natural"

77
0:04:31.233,000 --> 0:04:33,000
have no legal framework in the United States.

78
0:04:34.371,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Your best bet for fresh, nutrient-rich foods

79
0:04:38.112,000 --> 0:04:39,000
without the marketing jargon?

80
0:04:40.378,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Go to your farmers market.

81
0:04:42.94,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Buying local is not a new idea,

82
0:04:45.382,000 --> 0:04:48,000
but turning it into a habit in today's world still is.

83
0:04:49.136,000 --> 0:04:52,000
If we want to avoid the high costs of cheap food,

84
0:04:53.321,000 --> 0:04:54,000
protect our environment,

85
0:04:54.976,000 --> 0:04:56,000
rebuild our communities

86
0:04:57.324,000 --> 0:05:,000
and save our farmers -- literally --

87
0:05:01.426,000 --> 0:05:03,000
we're going to need to vote with our food purchases.

88
0:05:05.15,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The success of our food systems is directly attached to us.

89
0:05:09.961,000 --> 0:05:13,000
If we want to break up Big Ag's hold on our food supply chain,

90
0:05:14.275,000 --> 0:05:17,000
then we're going to need to connect with our farmers.

91
0:05:17.993,000 --> 0:05:19,000
We're going to need to rebuild relationships

92
0:05:20.481,000 --> 0:05:23,000
with the hands that feed us three times a day.

93
0:05:24.75,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Plus, two more for snacks.

94
0:05:27.465,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Come on.

95
0:05:30.541,000 --> 0:05:34,000
With a government online database of more than 8,600 farmers markets

96
0:05:35.145,000 --> 0:05:36,000
across the country,

97
0:05:36.334,000 --> 0:05:38,000
you can easily find the nearest one to you.

98
0:05:39.59,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Just think of yourself as an investor in food,

99
0:05:43.343,000 --> 0:05:46,000
where your purchasing power helps create a more equitable society for everyone.

100
0:05:48.062,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Oh!

101
0:05:49.788,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Almost forgot step three,

102
0:05:52.27,000 --> 0:05:53,000
which may surprise you:

103
0:05:55.595,000 --> 0:05:57,000
shop at your local farmers markets.

104
0:05:57.899,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Laughter)

105
0:05:58.993,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Thank you.

106
0:06:00.075,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Applause)

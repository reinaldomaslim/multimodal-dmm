2
0:00:13.212,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm not sure that every person here

3
0:00:15.342,000 --> 0:00:17,000
is familiar with my pictures.

4
0:00:18.079,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I want to start to show just a few pictures to you,

5
0:00:22.162,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and after I'll speak.

6
0:00:57.884,000 --> 0:01:,000
I must speak to you a little bit of my history,

7
0:01:01.836,000 --> 0:01:02,000
because we'll be speaking on this

8
0:01:03.783,000 --> 0:01:05,000
during my speech here.

9
0:01:06.764,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I was born in 1944 in Brazil,

10
0:01:09.9,000 --> 0:01:12,000
in the times that Brazil was not yet a market economy.

11
0:01:13.655,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I was born on a farm,

12
0:01:15.538,000 --> 0:01:19,000
a farm that was more than 50 percent rainforest [still].

13
0:01:20.04,000 --> 0:01:21,000
A marvelous place.

14
0:01:21.66,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I lived with incredible birds, incredible animals,

15
0:01:25.972,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I swam in our small rivers with our caimans.

16
0:01:30.213,000 --> 0:01:32,000
It was about 35 families that lived on this farm,

17
0:01:33.122,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and everything that we produced on this farm, we consumed.

18
0:01:37.404,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Very few things went to the market.

19
0:01:39.511,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Once a year, the only thing that went to the market

20
0:01:42.221,000 --> 0:01:43,000
was the cattle that we produced,

21
0:01:43.941,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and we made trips of about 45 days

22
0:01:46.71,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to reach the slaughterhouse,

23
0:01:48.886,000 --> 0:01:5,000
bringing thousands of head of cattle,

24
0:01:51.18,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and about 20 days traveling back

25
0:01:53.712,000 --> 0:01:55,000
to reach our farm again.

26
0:01:56.109,000 --> 0:01:58,000
When I was 15 years old,

27
0:01:58.486,000 --> 0:02:01,000
it was necessary for me to leave this place

28
0:02:01.991,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and go to a town a little bit bigger -- much bigger --

29
0:02:05.454,000 --> 0:02:08,000
where I did the second part of secondary school.

30
0:02:08.885,000 --> 0:02:1,000
There I learned different things.

31
0:02:11.653,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Brazil was starting to urbanize, industrialize,

32
0:02:14.278,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and I knew the politics. I became a little bit radical,

33
0:02:18.693,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I was a member of leftist parties,

34
0:02:21.535,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and I became an activist.

35
0:02:24.641,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I [went to] university to become an economist.

36
0:02:27.733,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I [did] a master's degree in economics.

37
0:02:30.413,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And the most important thing in my life

38
0:02:33.422,000 --> 0:02:34,000
also happened in this time.

39
0:02:35.081,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I met an incredible girl

40
0:02:37.77,000 --> 0:02:41,000
who became my lifelong best friend,

41
0:02:41.908,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and my associate in everything that I have done till now,

42
0:02:45.676,000 --> 0:02:48,000
my wife, Lélia Wanick Salgado.

43
0:02:48.94,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Brazil radicalized very strongly.

44
0:02:50.844,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We fought very hard against the dictatorship,

45
0:02:53.756,000 --> 0:02:54,000
in a moment it was necessary to us:

46
0:02:55.542,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Either go into clandestinity with weapons in hand,

47
0:02:59.126,000 --> 0:03:01,000
or leave Brazil. We were too young,

48
0:03:01.581,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and our organization thought it was better for us to go out,

49
0:03:06.782,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and we went to France,

50
0:03:07.746,000 --> 0:03:09,000
where I did a PhD in economics,

51
0:03:09.765,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Léila became an architect.

52
0:03:11.761,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I worked after for an investment bank.

53
0:03:14.844,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We made a lot of trips, financed development,

54
0:03:17.806,000 --> 0:03:19,000
economic projects in Africa with the World Bank.

55
0:03:20.661,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And one day photography made a total invasion in my life.

56
0:03:24.129,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I became a photographer,

57
0:03:25.367,000 --> 0:03:27,000
abandoned everything and became a photographer,

58
0:03:27.983,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and I started to do the photography

59
0:03:30.808,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that was important for me.

60
0:03:33.804,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Many people tell me that you are a photojournalist,

61
0:03:35.99,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that you are an anthropologist photographer,

62
0:03:38.566,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that you are an activist photographer.

63
0:03:41.327,000 --> 0:03:44,000
But I did much more than that.

64
0:03:44.327,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I put photography as my life.

65
0:03:47.009,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I lived totally inside photography

66
0:03:49.613,000 --> 0:03:51,000
doing long term projects,

67
0:03:51.648,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and I want to show you just a few pictures

68
0:03:54.158,000 --> 0:03:59,000
of -- again, you'll see inside the social projects,

69
0:04:00.055,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that I went to, I published many books

70
0:04:02.217,000 --> 0:04:05,000
on these photographs,

71
0:04:05.423,000 --> 0:04:08,000
but I'll just show you a few ones now.

72
0:04:54.949,000 --> 0:04:57,000
In the '90s, from 1994 to 2000,

73
0:04:58.724,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I photographed a story called Migrations.

74
0:05:01.965,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It became a book. It became a show.

75
0:05:03.842,000 --> 0:05:05,000
But during the time that I was photographing this,

76
0:05:06.6,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I lived through a very hard moment in my life, mostly in Rwanda.

77
0:05:12.337,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I saw in Rwanda total brutality.

78
0:05:16.648,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I saw deaths by thousands per day.

79
0:05:19.813,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I lost my faith in our species.

80
0:05:22.754,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I didn't believe that it was possible for us to live any longer,

81
0:05:26.945,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and I started to be attacked by my own Staphylococcus.

82
0:05:32.492,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I started to have infection everywhere.

83
0:05:35.476,000 --> 0:05:39,000
When I made love with my wife, I had no sperm that came out of me;

84
0:05:39.888,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I had blood.

85
0:05:42.715,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I went to see a friend's doctor in Paris,

86
0:05:45.596,000 --> 0:05:47,000
told him that I was completely sick.

87
0:05:48.362,000 --> 0:05:5,000
He made a long examination, and told me, "Sebastian,

88
0:05:51.216,000 --> 0:05:54,000
you are not sick, your prostate is perfect.

89
0:05:54.353,000 --> 0:05:58,000
What happened is, you saw so many deaths that you are dying.

90
0:05:58.441,000 --> 0:06:,000
You must stop. Stop.

91
0:06:01.36,000 --> 0:06:05,000
You must stop because on the contrary, you will be dead."

92
0:06:06.201,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And I made the decision to stop.

93
0:06:09.847,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I was really upset with photography,

94
0:06:12.14,000 --> 0:06:14,000
with everything in the world,

95
0:06:14.161,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and I made the decision to go back to where I was born.

96
0:06:18.001,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It was a big coincidence.

97
0:06:19.605,000 --> 0:06:22,000
It was the moment that my parents became very old.

98
0:06:23.016,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I have seven sisters. I'm one of the only men in my family,

99
0:06:26.577,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and they made together the decision

100
0:06:28.445,000 --> 0:06:3,000
to transfer this land to Léila and myself.

101
0:06:31.145,000 --> 0:06:36,000
When we received this land, this land was as dead as I was.

102
0:06:36.761,000 --> 0:06:39,000
When I was a kid, it was more than 50 percent rainforest.

103
0:06:40.065,000 --> 0:06:41,000
When we received the land,

104
0:06:41.587,000 --> 0:06:44,000
it was less than half a percent rainforest,

105
0:06:45.362,000 --> 0:06:46,000
as in all my region.

106
0:06:47.007,000 --> 0:06:49,000
To build development, Brazilian development,

107
0:06:49.936,000 --> 0:06:51,000
we destroyed a lot of our forest.

108
0:06:52.723,000 --> 0:06:53,000
As you did here in the United States,

109
0:06:54.706,000 --> 0:06:56,000
or you did in India, everywhere in this planet.

110
0:06:56.994,000 --> 0:06:57,000
To build our development,

111
0:06:58.672,000 --> 0:07:,000
we come to a huge contradiction

112
0:07:00.755,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that we destroy around us everything.

113
0:07:04.49,000 --> 0:07:07,000
This farm that had thousands of head of cattle

114
0:07:08.155,000 --> 0:07:1,000
had just a few hundreds,

115
0:07:10.322,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and we didn't know how to deal with these.

116
0:07:12.727,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And Léila came up with an incredible idea, a crazy idea.

117
0:07:16.627,000 --> 0:07:2,000
She said, why don't you put back the rainforest that was here before?

118
0:07:21.274,000 --> 0:07:22,000
You say that you were born in paradise.

119
0:07:22.78,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Let's build the paradise again.

120
0:07:25.706,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And I went to see a good friend

121
0:07:28.538,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that was engineering forests

122
0:07:30.071,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to prepare a project for us,

123
0:07:31.969,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and we started. We started to plant, and this

124
0:07:34.15,000 --> 0:07:38,000
first year we lost a lot of trees, second year less,

125
0:07:38.407,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and slowly, slowly this dead land started to be born again.

126
0:07:43.468,000 --> 0:07:46,000
We started to plant hundreds of thousands of trees,

127
0:07:46.831,000 --> 0:07:49,000
only local species, only native species,

128
0:07:50.271,000 --> 0:07:53,000
where we built an ecosystem identical to the one that was destroyed,

129
0:07:53.812,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and the life started to come back in an incredible way.

130
0:07:58.12,000 --> 0:08:,000
It was necessary for us to transform our land

131
0:08:00.919,000 --> 0:08:01,000
into a national park.

132
0:08:02.361,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We transformed. We gave this land back to nature.

133
0:08:05.019,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It became a national park.

134
0:08:06.394,000 --> 0:08:09,000
We created an institution called Instituto Terra,

135
0:08:10.144,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and we built a big environmental project to raise money everywhere.

136
0:08:15.123,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Here in Los Angeles, in the Bay Area in San Francisco,

137
0:08:18.908,000 --> 0:08:2,000
it became tax deductible in the United States.

138
0:08:21.059,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We raised money in Spain, in Italy, a lot in Brazil.

139
0:08:24.387,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We worked with a lot of companies in Brazil

140
0:08:26.595,000 --> 0:08:28,000
that put money into this project, the government.

141
0:08:28.843,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And the life started to come, and I had a big wish

142
0:08:33.027,000 --> 0:08:36,000
to come back to photography, to photograph again.

143
0:08:36.443,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And this time, my wish was not to photograph anymore

144
0:08:39.738,000 --> 0:08:43,000
just one animal that I had photographed all my life: us.

145
0:08:44.321,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I wished to photograph the other animals,

146
0:08:46.689,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to photograph the landscapes,

147
0:08:48.681,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to photograph us, but us from the beginning,

148
0:08:52.127,000 --> 0:08:54,000
the time we lived in equilibrium with nature.

149
0:08:54.657,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And I went. I started in the beginning of 2004,

150
0:08:59.21,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and I finished at the end of 2011.

151
0:09:02.41,000 --> 0:09:04,000
We created an incredible amount of pictures,

152
0:09:05.103,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and the result -- Lélia did the design of all my books,

153
0:09:08.673,000 --> 0:09:11,000
the design of all my shows. She is the creator of the shows.

154
0:09:11.737,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And what we want with these pictures

155
0:09:14.044,000 --> 0:09:2,000
is to create a discussion about what we have that is pristine on the planet

156
0:09:20.456,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and what we must hold on this planet

157
0:09:22.979,000 --> 0:09:25,000
if we want to live, to have some equilibrium in our life.

158
0:09:26.277,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And I wanted to see us

159
0:09:28.788,000 --> 0:09:33,000
when we used, yes, our instruments in stone.

160
0:09:34.655,000 --> 0:09:36,000
We exist yet. I was last week

161
0:09:36.812,000 --> 0:09:38,000
at the Brazilian National Indian Foundation,

162
0:09:39.708,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and only in the Amazon we have about 110 groups

163
0:09:43.014,000 --> 0:09:45,000
of Indians that are not contacted yet.

164
0:09:45.945,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We must protect the forest in this sense.

165
0:09:48.478,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And with these pictures, I hope that we can create

166
0:09:53.313,000 --> 0:09:55,000
information, a system of information.

167
0:09:55.542,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We tried to do a new presentation of the planet,

168
0:09:59.288,000 --> 0:10:,000
and I want to show you now just a few pictures

169
0:10:01.214,000 --> 0:10:04,000
of this project, please.

170
0:11:59.543,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Well, this — (Applause) —

171
0:12:01.975,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Thank you. Thank you very much.

172
0:12:09.142,000 --> 0:12:12,000
This is what we must fight hard

173
0:12:12.228,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to hold like it is now.

174
0:12:14.119,000 --> 0:12:18,000
But there is another part that we must together rebuild,

175
0:12:18.23,000 --> 0:12:22,000
to build our societies, our modern family of societies,

176
0:12:22.247,000 --> 0:12:24,000
we are at a point where we cannot go back.

177
0:12:24.886,000 --> 0:12:26,000
But we create an incredible contradiction.

178
0:12:27.094,000 --> 0:12:29,000
To build all this, we destroy a lot.

179
0:12:29.39,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Our forest in Brazil, that antique forest

180
0:12:31.6,000 --> 0:12:33,000
that was the size of California,

181
0:12:34.486,000 --> 0:12:36,000
is destroyed today 93 percent.

182
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Here, on the West Coast, you've destroyed your forest.

183
0:12:40.154,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Around here, no? The redwood forests are gone.

184
0:12:43.391,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Gone very fast, disappeared.

185
0:12:45.258,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Coming the other day from Atlanta, here, two days ago,

186
0:12:47.927,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I was flying over deserts

187
0:12:49.771,000 --> 0:12:51,000
that we made, we provoked with our own hands.

188
0:12:52.631,000 --> 0:12:54,000
India has no more trees. Spain has no more trees.

189
0:12:55.29,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And we must rebuild these forests.

190
0:12:58.799,000 --> 0:13:01,000
That is the essence of our life, these forests.

191
0:13:02.447,000 --> 0:13:06,000
We need to breathe. The only factory

192
0:13:06.689,000 --> 0:13:09,000
capable to transform CO2 into oxygen,

193
0:13:10.265,000 --> 0:13:11,000
are the forests.

194
0:13:12.009,000 --> 0:13:16,000
The only machine capable to capture the carbon

195
0:13:16.363,000 --> 0:13:18,000
that we are producing, always,

196
0:13:19.214,000 --> 0:13:23,000
even if we reduce them, everything that we do, we produce CO2,

197
0:13:23.379,000 --> 0:13:24,000
are the trees.

198
0:13:24.878,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I put the question -- three or four weeks ago,

199
0:13:29.244,000 --> 0:13:3,000
we saw in the newspapers

200
0:13:30.933,000 --> 0:13:32,000
millions of fish that die in Norway.

201
0:13:33.825,000 --> 0:13:36,000
A lack of oxygen in the water.

202
0:13:36.841,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I put to myself the question, if for a moment,

203
0:13:39.073,000 --> 0:13:42,000
we will not lack oxygen for all animal species,

204
0:13:43.06,000 --> 0:13:46,000
ours included -- that would be very complicated for us.

205
0:13:46.498,000 --> 0:13:5,000
For the water system, the trees are essential.

206
0:13:50.802,000 --> 0:13:53,000
I'll give you a small example that you'll understand very easily.

207
0:13:54.474,000 --> 0:13:57,000
You happy people that have a lot of hair on your head,

208
0:13:58.4,000 --> 0:14:01,000
if you take a shower, it takes you

209
0:14:01.565,000 --> 0:14:04,000
two or three hours to dry your hair

210
0:14:05.089,000 --> 0:14:07,000
if you don't use a dryer machine.

211
0:14:07.41,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Me, one minute, it's dry. The same with the trees.

212
0:14:12.191,000 --> 0:14:14,000
The trees are the hair of our planet.

213
0:14:14.893,000 --> 0:14:17,000
When you have rain in a place that has no trees,

214
0:14:18.682,000 --> 0:14:21,000
in just a few minutes, the water arrives in the stream,

215
0:14:22.11,000 --> 0:14:24,000
brings soil, destroying our water source,

216
0:14:24.693,000 --> 0:14:25,000
destroying the rivers,

217
0:14:26.6,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and no humidity to retain.

218
0:14:28.01,000 --> 0:14:32,000
When you have trees, the root system holds the water.

219
0:14:32.301,000 --> 0:14:34,000
All the branches of the trees, the leaves that come down

220
0:14:35.029,000 --> 0:14:37,000
create a humid area,

221
0:14:37.091,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and they take months and months under the water, go to the rivers,

222
0:14:41.811,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and maintain our source, maintain our rivers.

223
0:14:45.011,000 --> 0:14:47,000
This is the most important thing,

224
0:14:47.015,000 --> 0:14:51,000
when we imagine that we need water for every activity in life.

225
0:14:51.478,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I want to show you now, to finish,

226
0:14:53.666,000 --> 0:14:55,000
just a few pictures that for me

227
0:14:56.366,000 --> 0:14:58,000
are very important in that direction.

228
0:14:59.305,000 --> 0:15:01,000
You remember that I told you,

229
0:15:01.455,000 --> 0:15:03,000
when I received the farm from my parents

230
0:15:03.558,000 --> 0:15:05,000
that was my paradise, that was the farm.

231
0:15:06.358,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Land completely destroyed, the erosion there, the land had dried.

232
0:15:11.868,000 --> 0:15:13,000
But you can see in this picture,

233
0:15:14.424,000 --> 0:15:18,000
we were starting to construct an educational center

234
0:15:18.439,000 --> 0:15:22,000
that became quite a large environmental center in Brazil.

235
0:15:23.403,000 --> 0:15:27,000
But you see a lot of small spots in this picture.

236
0:15:27.741,000 --> 0:15:3,000
In each point of those spots, we had planted a tree.

237
0:15:31.318,000 --> 0:15:32,000
There are thousands of trees.

238
0:15:32.893,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Now I'll show you the pictures made exactly in the same point

239
0:15:36.101,000 --> 0:15:38,000
two months ago.

240
0:15:39.807,000 --> 0:15:46,000
(Applause)

241
0:15:48.857,000 --> 0:15:49,000
I told you in the beginning that it was necessary

242
0:15:50.615,000 --> 0:15:54,000
for us to plant about 2.5 million trees

243
0:15:55.415,000 --> 0:15:57,000
of about 200 different species

244
0:15:57.854,000 --> 0:16:,000
in order to rebuild the ecosystem.

245
0:16:01.094,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And I'll show you the last picture.

246
0:16:03.629,000 --> 0:16:06,000
We are with two million trees in the ground now.

247
0:16:06.798,000 --> 0:16:07,000
We are doing the sequestration

248
0:16:08.447,000 --> 0:16:12,000
of about 100,000 tons of carbon with these trees.

249
0:16:12.901,000 --> 0:16:16,000
My friends, it's very easy to do. We did it, no?

250
0:16:17.445,000 --> 0:16:19,000
By an accident that happened to me,

251
0:16:19.757,000 --> 0:16:22,000
we went back, we built an ecosystem.

252
0:16:23.157,000 --> 0:16:25,000
We here inside the room,

253
0:16:25.824,000 --> 0:16:28,000
I believe that we have the same concern,

254
0:16:29.36,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and the model that we created in Brazil,

255
0:16:31.796,000 --> 0:16:32,000
we can transplant it here.

256
0:16:33.141,000 --> 0:16:36,000
We can apply it everywhere around the world, no?

257
0:16:36.164,000 --> 0:16:38,000
And I believe that we can do it together.

258
0:16:39.112,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Thank you very much.

259
0:16:40.741,000 --> 0:16:44,000
(Applause)

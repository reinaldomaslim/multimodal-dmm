1
0:00:13.634,000 --> 0:00:15,000
What does it mean to be normal?

2
0:00:16.857,000 --> 0:00:17,000
And what does it mean to be sick?

3
0:00:21.087,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I've asked myself this question from the time I was about seven,

4
0:00:24.568,000 --> 0:00:26,000
when I was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome.

5
0:00:27.115,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Tourette's is a neurological disorder

6
0:00:29.243,000 --> 0:00:34,000
characterized by stereotyped movements I perform against my will, called tics.

7
0:00:35.524,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Now, tics are technically involuntary,

8
0:00:38.563,000 --> 0:00:41,000
in the sense that they occur without any conscious attention

9
0:00:41.802,000 --> 0:00:42,000
or intention on my part.

10
0:00:44.228,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But there's a funny thing about how I experience tics.

11
0:00:49.021,000 --> 0:00:53,000
They feel more unvoluntary than involuntary,

12
0:00:53.665,000 --> 0:00:55,000
because I still feel like it's me moving my shoulder,

13
0:00:56.649,000 --> 0:00:57,000
not some external force.

14
0:00:58.696,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Also, I get this uncomfortable sensation, called premonitory urge,

15
0:01:03.545,000 --> 0:01:04,000
right before tics happen,

16
0:01:04.939,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and particularly when I'm trying to resist them.

17
0:01:07.633,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Now, I imagine most of you out there understand what I'm saying,

18
0:01:10.705,000 --> 0:01:13,000
but unless you have Tourette's, you probably think you can't relate.

19
0:01:15.776,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But I bet you can.

20
0:01:17.664,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So, let's try a little experiment here and see if I can give you

21
0:01:20.705,000 --> 0:01:23,000
a taste of what my experience feels like.

22
0:01:23.831,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Alright, ready?

23
0:01:25.776,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Don't blink.

24
0:01:27.077,000 --> 0:01:28,000
No, really, don't blink.

25
0:01:28.712,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And besides dry eyes, what do you feel?

26
0:01:33.509,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Phantom pressure?

27
0:01:35.794,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Eyelids tingling?

28
0:01:37.945,000 --> 0:01:38,000
A need?

29
0:01:39.81,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Are you holding your breath?

30
0:01:41.429,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:42.604,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Aha.

32
0:01:43.779,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:47.942,000 --> 0:01:5,000
That's approximately what my tics feels like.

34
0:01:52.315,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Now, tics and blinking, neurologically speaking, are not the same,

35
0:01:56.03,000 --> 0:02:,000
but my point is that you don't have to have Tourette's

36
0:02:00.602,000 --> 0:02:04,000
to be able to relate to my experience of my premonitory urges,

37
0:02:05.625,000 --> 0:02:1,000
because your brain can give you similar experiences and feelings.

38
0:02:12.078,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So, let's shift the conversation from what it means to be normal versus sick

39
0:02:17.903,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to what it means that a majority of us are both normal and sick.

40
0:02:24.697,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Because in the final analysis, we're all humans

41
0:02:28.078,000 --> 0:02:32,000
whose brains provide for a spectrum of experiences.

42
0:02:34.563,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And everything on that spectrum of human experiences

43
0:02:37.333,000 --> 0:02:41,000
is ultimately produced by brain systems

44
0:02:41.72,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that assume a spectrum of different states.

45
0:02:45.744,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So again, what does it mean to be normal,

46
0:02:48.443,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and what does it mean to be sick,

47
0:02:50.427,000 --> 0:02:55,000
when sickness exists on the extreme end of a spectrum of normal?

48
0:02:57.88,000 --> 0:03:,000
As both a researcher who studies differences in how individuals' brains

49
0:03:01.602,000 --> 0:03:02,000
wire and rewire themselves,

50
0:03:03.396,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and as a Touretter with other related diagnoses,

51
0:03:06.419,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I have long been fascinated by failures of self-regulation

52
0:03:11.049,000 --> 0:03:15,000
on the impulsive and compulsive behavioral spectrums.

53
0:03:15.342,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Because so much of my own experience of my own body

54
0:03:19.49,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and my own behavior

55
0:03:20.752,000 --> 0:03:22,000
has existed all over that map.

56
0:03:25.561,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So with the spotlight on the opioid crisis,

57
0:03:31.636,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I've really found myself wondering lately:

58
0:03:35.08,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Where on the spectrum of unvoluntary behavior

59
0:03:38.72,000 --> 0:03:43,000
do we put something like abusing opioid painkillers or heroin?

60
0:03:45.569,000 --> 0:03:5,000
By now, we all know that the opioid crisis and epidemic is out of control.

61
0:03:52.084,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Ninety-one people die every day in this country from overdose.

62
0:03:55.464,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And between 2002 and 2015,

63
0:03:58.137,000 --> 0:04:01,000
the number of deaths from heroin increased by a factor of six.

64
0:04:04.125,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And something about the way that we treat addiction isn't working,

65
0:04:08.688,000 --> 0:04:09,000
at least not for everyone.

66
0:04:11.569,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It is a fact that people suffering from addiction

67
0:04:15.029,000 --> 0:04:16,000
have lost free will

68
0:04:16.971,000 --> 0:04:22,000
when it comes to their behavior around drugs, alcohol, food

69
0:04:23.093,000 --> 0:04:26,000
or other reward-system stimulating behaviors.

70
0:04:26.792,000 --> 0:04:3,000
That addiction is a brain-based disease state

71
0:04:30.959,000 --> 0:04:33,000
is a medical, neurobiological reality.

72
0:04:35.625,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But how we relate to that disease --

73
0:04:38.173,000 --> 0:04:43,000
indeed, how we relate to the concept of disease when it comes to addiction --

74
0:04:43.553,000 --> 0:04:47,000
makes an enormous difference for how we treat people with addictions.

75
0:04:49.42,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So, we tend to think of pretty much everything we do as entirely voluntary.

76
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:57,000
But it turns out that the brain's default state

77
0:04:57.911,000 --> 0:05:02,000
is really more like a car idling in drive than a car in park.

78
0:05:04.672,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Some of what we think we choose to do

79
0:05:07.204,000 --> 0:05:11,000
is actually things that we have become programmed to do

80
0:05:11.243,000 --> 0:05:12,000
when the brakes are released.

81
0:05:14.95,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Have you ever joked that your brain was running on autopilot?

82
0:05:20.196,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Guess what?

83
0:05:21.744,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It probably was.

84
0:05:23.871,000 --> 0:05:24,000
OK?

85
0:05:25.053,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And the brain's autopilot is in a structure called the striatum.

86
0:05:31.903,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So the striatum detects emotional and sensory motor conditions

87
0:05:40.006,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and it knows to trigger whatever behavior you have done most often

88
0:05:46.459,000 --> 0:05:48,000
in the past under those same conditions.

89
0:05:51.546,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Do you know why I became a neuroscientist?

90
0:05:55.54,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Because I wanted to learn what made me tick.

91
0:05:57.935,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Laughter)

92
0:06:00.413,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Thank you, thank you.

93
0:06:01.983,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Laughter)

94
0:06:03.27,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I've been wanting to use that one in front of an audience for years.

95
0:06:06.522,000 --> 0:06:07,000
(Applause)

96
0:06:08.188,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So in graduate school, I studied genetic factors

97
0:06:11.467,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that orchestrate wiring to the striatum during development.

98
0:06:16.458,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And yes, that is my former license plate.

99
0:06:20.027,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Laughter)

100
0:06:21.463,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And for the record, I don't recommend

101
0:06:23.297,000 --> 0:06:27,000
any PhD student get a license plate with their thesis topic printed on it,

102
0:06:27.431,000 --> 0:06:29,000
unless they're prepared for their experiments not to work

103
0:06:30.128,000 --> 0:06:31,000
for the next two years.

104
0:06:31.323,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Laughter)

105
0:06:32.501,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I eventually did figure it out.

106
0:06:34.132,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So, my experiments were exploring how miswiring in the striatum

107
0:06:39.569,000 --> 0:06:41,000
relates to compulsive behaviors.

108
0:06:41.657,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Meaning, behaviors that are coerced

109
0:06:44.458,000 --> 0:06:47,000
by uncomfortable urges you can't consciously resist.

110
0:06:48.165,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So I was really excited when my mice developed

111
0:06:52.141,000 --> 0:06:54,000
this compulsive behavior,

112
0:06:54.403,000 --> 0:06:57,000
where they were rubbing their faces and they couldn't seem to stop,

113
0:06:57.673,000 --> 0:06:58,000
even when they were wounding themselves.

114
0:06:59.625,000 --> 0:07:01,000
OK, excited is the wrong word,

115
0:07:02.514,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I actually felt terrible for them.

116
0:07:06.514,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I thought that they had tics, evidence of striatal miswiring.

117
0:07:11.973,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And they were compulsive,

118
0:07:13.806,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but it turned out, on further testing,

119
0:07:17.703,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that these mice showed an aversion to interacting

120
0:07:22.49,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and getting to know other unfamiliar mice.

121
0:07:24.581,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Which was unusual, it was unexpected.

122
0:07:26.649,000 --> 0:07:29,000
The results implied that the striatum,

123
0:07:29.943,000 --> 0:07:31,000
which, for sure, is involved in compulsive-spectrum disorders,

124
0:07:32.966,000 --> 0:07:37,000
is also involved in human social connection and our ability to --

125
0:07:38.152,000 --> 0:07:4,000
not human social connection, but our ability to connect.

126
0:07:44.387,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So I delved deeper,

127
0:07:46.498,000 --> 0:07:48,000
into a field called social neuroscience.

128
0:07:49.347,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And that is a newer, interdisciplinary field,

129
0:07:51.665,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and there I found reports that linked the striatum

130
0:07:54.381,000 --> 0:07:56,000
not just to social anomalies in mice,

131
0:07:57.22,000 --> 0:07:58,000
but also in people.

132
0:07:59.458,000 --> 0:08:04,000
As it turns out, the social neurochemistry in the striatum

133
0:08:06.243,000 --> 0:08:1,000
is linked to things you've probably already heard of.

134
0:08:10.974,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Like oxytocin,

135
0:08:12.427,000 --> 0:08:16,000
which is that hormone that makes cuddling feel all warm and fuzzy.

136
0:08:17.475,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But it also implicates signaling at opioid receptors.

137
0:08:21.943,000 --> 0:08:23,000
There are naturally occurring opioids in your brain

138
0:08:24.403,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that are deeply linked to social processes.

139
0:08:30.754,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Experiments with naloxone, which blocks opioid receptors,

140
0:08:35.517,000 --> 0:08:4,000
show us just how essential this opioid-receptor signaling is

141
0:08:40.875,000 --> 0:08:41,000
to social interaction.

142
0:08:45.736,000 --> 0:08:49,000
When people are given naloxone -- it's an ingredient in Narcan,

143
0:08:50.078,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that reverses opioid overdoses to save lives.

144
0:08:53.386,000 --> 0:08:55,000
But when it's given to healthy people,

145
0:08:55.871,000 --> 0:08:58,000
it actually interfered with their ability to feel connected

146
0:08:59.561,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to people they already knew and cared about.

147
0:09:03.275,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So, something about not having opioid-receptor binding

148
0:09:09.18,000 --> 0:09:12,000
makes it difficult for us to feel the rewards of social interaction.

149
0:09:14.27,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Now, for the interest of time,

150
0:09:15.786,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I've necessarily gotten rid of some of the scientific details,

151
0:09:18.818,000 --> 0:09:2,000
but briefly, here's where we're at.

152
0:09:22.228,000 --> 0:09:25,000
The effects of social disconnection through opioid receptors,

153
0:09:26.228,000 --> 0:09:28,000
the effects of addictive drugs

154
0:09:28.538,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and the effects of abnormal neurotransmission

155
0:09:31.053,000 --> 0:09:33,000
on involuntary movements and compulsive behaviors

156
0:09:33.934,000 --> 0:09:35,000
all converge in the striatum.

157
0:09:38.839,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And the striatum and opioid signaling in it

158
0:09:42.395,000 --> 0:09:44,000
has been deeply linked with loneliness.

159
0:09:48.877,000 --> 0:09:51,000
When we don't have enough signaling at opioid receptors,

160
0:09:52.418,000 --> 0:09:57,000
we can feel alone in a room full of people we care about and love, who love us.

161
0:09:58.774,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Social neuroscientists, like Dr. Cacioppo at the University of Chicago,

162
0:10:03.307,000 --> 0:10:05,000
have discovered that loneliness is very dangerous.

163
0:10:06.873,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And it predisposes people

164
0:10:08.157,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to entire spectrums of physical and mental illnesses.

165
0:10:16.515,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Think of it like this: when you're at your hungriest,

166
0:10:19.897,000 --> 0:10:22,000
pretty much any food tastes amazing, right?

167
0:10:23.127,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So similarly, loneliness creates a hunger in the brain

168
0:10:27.871,000 --> 0:10:32,000
which neurochemically hypersensitizes our reward system.

169
0:10:34.355,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And social isolation acts through receptors

170
0:10:37.332,000 --> 0:10:4,000
for these naturally occurring opioids and other social neurotransmitters

171
0:10:41.307,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to leave the striatum in a state

172
0:10:43.76,000 --> 0:10:47,000
where its response to things that signal reward and pleasure

173
0:10:47.934,000 --> 0:10:49,000
is completely, completely over the top.

174
0:10:51.307,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And in this state of hypersensitivity,

175
0:10:54.363,000 --> 0:10:58,000
our brains signal deep dissatisfaction.

176
0:10:59.976,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We become restless, irritable and impulsive.

177
0:11:05.769,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And that's pretty much when I want you to keep the bowl of Halloween chocolate

178
0:11:09.5,000 --> 0:11:11,000
entirely across the room for me, because I will eat it all.

179
0:11:12.378,000 --> 0:11:13,000
I will.

180
0:11:13.553,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And that brings up another thing that makes social disconnection

181
0:11:17.243,000 --> 0:11:18,000
so dangerous.

182
0:11:19.346,000 --> 0:11:21,000
If we don't have the ability to connect socially,

183
0:11:21.704,000 --> 0:11:25,000
we are so ravenous for our social neurochemistry to be rebalanced,

184
0:11:26.569,000 --> 0:11:28,000
we're likely to seek relief from anywhere.

185
0:11:28.887,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And if that anywhere is opioid painkillers or heroin,

186
0:11:34.752,000 --> 0:11:4,000
it is going to be a heat-seeking missile for our social reward system.

187
0:11:42.601,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Is it any wonder people in today's world are becoming addicted so easily?

188
0:11:51.022,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Social isolation --

189
0:11:56.926,000 --> 0:11:57,000
excuse me --

190
0:11:59.736,000 --> 0:12:,000
contributes to relapse.

191
0:12:01.953,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Studies have shown that people who tend to avoid relapse

192
0:12:06.104,000 --> 0:12:1,000
tend to be people who have broad, reciprocal social relationships

193
0:12:10.927,000 --> 0:12:12,000
where they can be of service to each other,

194
0:12:12.98,000 --> 0:12:13,000
where they can be helpful.

195
0:12:14.268,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Being of service lets people connect.

196
0:12:18.101,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So --

197
0:12:21.863,000 --> 0:12:26,000
if we don't have the ability to authentically connect,

198
0:12:27.289,000 --> 0:12:31,000
our society increasingly lacks this ability to authentically connect

199
0:12:33.101,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and experience things that are transcendent and beyond ourselves.

200
0:12:37.379,000 --> 0:12:38,000
We used to get this transcendence

201
0:12:39.001,000 --> 0:12:42,000
from a feeling of belonging to our families and our communities.

202
0:12:42.238,000 --> 0:12:45,000
But everywhere, communities are changing.

203
0:12:45.8,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And social and economic disintegration is making this harder and harder.

204
0:12:54.414,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I'm not the only person to point out

205
0:12:56.994,000 --> 0:12:59,000
that the areas in the country most economically hard hit,

206
0:13:00.462,000 --> 0:13:03,000
where people feel most desolate about their life's meaning,

207
0:13:03.956,000 --> 0:13:05,000
are also the places

208
0:13:06.124,000 --> 0:13:12,000
where there have been communities most ravaged by opioids.

209
0:13:14.284,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Social isolation acts through the brain's reward system

210
0:13:17.776,000 --> 0:13:2,000
to make this state of affairs literally painful.

211
0:13:21.72,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So perhaps it's this pain, this loneliness,

212
0:13:26.054,000 --> 0:13:28,000
this despondence

213
0:13:29.062,000 --> 0:13:32,000
that's driving so many of us to connect with whatever we can.

214
0:13:33.434,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Like food.

215
0:13:35.757,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Like handheld electronics.

216
0:13:38.36,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And for too many people, to drugs like heroin and fentanyl.

217
0:13:41.892,000 --> 0:13:44,000
I know someone who overdosed, who was revived by Narcan,

218
0:13:46.753,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and she was mostly angry that she wasn't simply allowed to die.

219
0:13:50.459,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Imagine for a second how that feels, that state of hopelessness, OK?

220
0:13:55.959,000 --> 0:13:59,000
But the striatum is also a source of hope.

221
0:14:00.012,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Because the striatum gives us a clue of how to bring people back.

222
0:14:05.56,000 --> 0:14:08,000
So, remember that the striatum is our autopilot,

223
0:14:08.68,000 --> 0:14:09,000
running our behaviors on habit,

224
0:14:10.266,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and it's possible to rewire, to reprogram that autopilot,

225
0:14:14.657,000 --> 0:14:15,000
but it involves neuroplasticity.

226
0:14:16.362,000 --> 0:14:18,000
So, neuroplasticity is the ability of brains

227
0:14:19.109,000 --> 0:14:21,000
to reprogram themselves,

228
0:14:21.895,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and rewire themselves, so we can learn new things.

229
0:14:24.403,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And maybe you've heard the classic adage of plasticity:

230
0:14:27.014,000 --> 0:14:29,000
neurons that fire together, wire together.

231
0:14:30.323,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Right?

232
0:14:31.531,000 --> 0:14:35,000
So we need to practice social connective behaviors

233
0:14:35.863,000 --> 0:14:38,000
instead of compulsive behaviors, when we're lonely,

234
0:14:38.99,000 --> 0:14:41,000
when we are cued to remember our drug.

235
0:14:45.371,000 --> 0:14:49,000
We need neuronally firing repeated experiences

236
0:14:49.482,000 --> 0:14:52,000
in order for the striatum to undergo that necessary neuroplasticity

237
0:14:53.18,000 --> 0:14:59,000
that allows it to take that "go find heroin" autopilot offline.

238
0:14:59.204,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And what the convergence of social neuroscience, addiction

239
0:15:04.077,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and compulsive-spectrum disorders in the striatum suggests

240
0:15:06.895,000 --> 0:15:07,000
is that it's not simply enough

241
0:15:08.625,000 --> 0:15:11,000
to teach the striatum healthier responses to compulsive urges.

242
0:15:12.038,000 --> 0:15:17,000
We need social impulses to replace drug-cued compulsive behaviors,

243
0:15:17.831,000 --> 0:15:23,000
because we need to rebalance, neurochemically, our social reward system.

244
0:15:24.069,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And unless that happens,

245
0:15:25.258,000 --> 0:15:27,000
we're going to be left in a state of craving.

246
0:15:28.331,000 --> 0:15:31,000
No matter what besides our drug we repeatedly practice doing.

247
0:15:37.539,000 --> 0:15:41,000
I believe that the solution to the opioid crisis

248
0:15:42.42,000 --> 0:15:45,000
is to explore how social and psychospiritual interventions

249
0:15:46.069,000 --> 0:15:49,000
can act as neurotechnologies in circuits

250
0:15:50.014,000 --> 0:15:53,000
that process social and drug-induced rewards.

251
0:15:54.783,000 --> 0:15:59,000
One possibility is to create and study scalable tools

252
0:15:59.918,000 --> 0:16:01,000
for people to connect with one another

253
0:16:02.427,000 --> 0:16:03,000
over a mutual interest

254
0:16:04.053,000 --> 0:16:06,000
in recovery through psychospiritual practices.

255
0:16:06.244,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And as such, psychospiritual practice could involve anything

256
0:16:09.53,000 --> 0:16:12,000
from people getting together as megafans of touring jam bands,

257
0:16:14.959,000 --> 0:16:18,000
or parkour jams, featuring shared experiences of vulnerability

258
0:16:18.999,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and personal growth,

259
0:16:20.213,000 --> 0:16:23,000
or more conventional things, like recovery yoga meetups,

260
0:16:23.342,000 --> 0:16:25,000
or meetings centered around more traditional conceptions

261
0:16:26.232,000 --> 0:16:27,000
of spiritual experiences.

262
0:16:28.104,000 --> 0:16:3,000
But whatever it is,

263
0:16:30.334,000 --> 0:16:32,000
it needs to activate

264
0:16:32.958,000 --> 0:16:34,000
all of the neurotransmitter systems in the striatum

265
0:16:35.903,000 --> 0:16:37,000
that are involved in processing social connection.

266
0:16:41.411,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Social media can't go deep enough for this.

267
0:16:43.799,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Social media doesn't so much encourage us to share,

268
0:16:47.101,000 --> 0:16:48,000
as it does to compare.

269
0:16:48.712,000 --> 0:16:52,000
It's the difference between having superficial small talk with someone

270
0:16:53.236,000 --> 0:16:57,000
and authentic, deeply connected conversation with eye contact.

271
0:16:58.442,000 --> 0:17:01,000
And stigma also keeps us separate.

272
0:17:01.757,000 --> 0:17:04,000
There's a lot of evidence that it keeps us sick.

273
0:17:05.806,000 --> 0:17:09,000
And stigma often makes it safer for addicts to connect with other addicts.

274
0:17:10.656,000 --> 0:17:14,000
But recovery groups centered around reestablishing social connections

275
0:17:15.473,000 --> 0:17:19,000
could certainly be inclusive of people who are seeking recovery

276
0:17:20.382,000 --> 0:17:22,000
for a range of mental health problems.

277
0:17:24.093,000 --> 0:17:27,000
My point is, when we connect around what's broken,

278
0:17:29.902,000 --> 0:17:31,000
we connect as human beings.

279
0:17:33.998,000 --> 0:17:38,000
We heal ourselves from the compulsive self-destruction

280
0:17:39.948,000 --> 0:17:42,000
that was our response to the pain of disconnection.

281
0:17:44.18,000 --> 0:17:5,000
When we think of neuropsychiatric illnesses as a spectrum of phenomenon

282
0:17:50.395,000 --> 0:17:52,000
that are part of what make us human,

283
0:17:53.284,000 --> 0:17:56,000
then we remove the otherness of people who struggle with self-destruction.

284
0:17:57.307,000 --> 0:18:,000
We remove the stigma

285
0:18:01.924,000 --> 0:18:04,000
between doctors and patients and caregivers.

286
0:18:05.966,000 --> 0:18:1,000
We put the question of what it means to be normal versus sick

287
0:18:11.323,000 --> 0:18:14,000
back on the spectrum of the human condition.

288
0:18:14.831,000 --> 0:18:19,000
And it is on that spectrum where we can all connect

289
0:18:19.865,000 --> 0:18:23,000
and seek healing together, for all of our struggles with humanness.

290
0:18:24.873,000 --> 0:18:25,000
Thank you for letting me share.

291
0:18:26.46,000 --> 0:18:3,000

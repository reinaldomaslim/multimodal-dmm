2
0:00:15.536,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I want to talk to you today about something

3
0:00:17.481,000 --> 0:00:2,000
the open-source programming world can teach democracy,

4
0:00:20.496,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but before that, a little preamble.

5
0:00:22.131,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Let's start here.

6
0:00:23.951,000 --> 0:00:26,000
This is Martha Payne. Martha's a 9-year-old Scot

7
0:00:27.346,000 --> 0:00:29,000
who lives in the Council of Argyll and Bute.

8
0:00:29.367,000 --> 0:00:31,000
A couple months ago, Payne started a food blog

9
0:00:32.06,000 --> 0:00:34,000
called NeverSeconds, and she would take her camera

10
0:00:34.933,000 --> 0:00:36,000
with her every day to school to document

11
0:00:37.213,000 --> 0:00:39,000
her school lunches.

12
0:00:39.227,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Can you spot the vegetable? (Laughter)

13
0:00:41.116,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And, as sometimes happens,

14
0:00:44.87,000 --> 0:00:46,000
this blog acquired first dozens of readers,

15
0:00:47.46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and then hundreds of readers,

16
0:00:49.14,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and then thousands of readers, as people tuned in

17
0:00:51.726,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to watch her rate her school lunches,

18
0:00:53.394,000 --> 0:00:54,000
including on my favorite category,

19
0:00:54.919,000 --> 0:00:57,000
"Pieces of hair found in food." (Laughter)

20
0:00:58.511,000 --> 0:01:01,000
This was a zero day. That's good.

21
0:01:01.982,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And then two weeks ago yesterday, she posted this.

22
0:01:05.176,000 --> 0:01:06,000
A post that read: "Goodbye."

23
0:01:07.087,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And she said, "I'm very sorry to tell you this, but

24
0:01:10.301,000 --> 0:01:12,000
my head teacher pulled me out of class today and told me

25
0:01:13.045,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I'm not allowed to take pictures in the lunch room anymore.

26
0:01:16.041,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I really enjoyed doing this.

27
0:01:17.767,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Thank you for reading. Goodbye."

28
0:01:20.997,000 --> 0:01:25,000
You can guess what happened next, right? (Laughter)

29
0:01:26.175,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The outrage was so swift, so voluminous, so unanimous,

30
0:01:32.093,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that the Council of Argyll and Bute reversed themselves

31
0:01:35.039,000 --> 0:01:36,000
the same day and said, "We would,

32
0:01:36.325,000 --> 0:01:38,000
we would never censor a nine-year-old." (Laughter)

33
0:01:38.491,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Except, of course, this morning. (Laughter)

34
0:01:40.968,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And this brings up the question,

35
0:01:45.381,000 --> 0:01:47,000
what made them think they could get away

36
0:01:47.595,000 --> 0:01:49,000
with something like that? (Laughter)

37
0:01:49.645,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And the answer is, all of human history prior to now.

38
0:01:54.362,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Laughter) So,

39
0:01:57.91,000 --> 0:02:,000
what happens when a medium suddenly puts

40
0:02:01.835,000 --> 0:02:04,000
a lot of new ideas into circulation?

41
0:02:05.539,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Now, this isn't just a contemporaneous question.

42
0:02:07.644,000 --> 0:02:09,000
This is something we've faced several times

43
0:02:09.644,000 --> 0:02:1,000
over the last few centuries.

44
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:12,000
When the telegraph came along, it was clear

45
0:02:12.985,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that it was going to globalize the news industry.

46
0:02:15.203,000 --> 0:02:16,000
What would this lead to?

47
0:02:16.692,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Well, obviously, it would lead to world peace.

48
0:02:20.256,000 --> 0:02:22,000
The television, a medium that allowed us not just to hear

49
0:02:23.066,000 --> 0:02:25,000
but see, literally see, what was going on

50
0:02:25.833,000 --> 0:02:27,000
elsewhere in the world, what would this lead to?

51
0:02:28.15,000 --> 0:02:3,000
World peace. (Laughter)

52
0:02:30.39,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The telephone?

53
0:02:31.347,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You guessed it: world peace.

54
0:02:33.942,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Sorry for the spoiler alert, but no world peace. Not yet.

55
0:02:38.916,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Even the printing press, even the printing press

56
0:02:41.395,000 --> 0:02:44,000
was assumed to be a tool that was going to enforce

57
0:02:44.524,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Catholic intellectual hegemony across Europe.

58
0:02:48.177,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Instead, what we got was Martin Luther's 95 Theses,

59
0:02:50.661,000 --> 0:02:52,000
the Protestant Reformation, and, you know,

60
0:02:52.681,000 --> 0:02:54,000
the Thirty Years' War. All right,

61
0:02:55.039,000 --> 0:02:59,000
so what all of these predictions of world peace got right

62
0:02:59.27,000 --> 0:03:01,000
is that when a lot of new ideas suddenly

63
0:03:01.801,000 --> 0:03:03,000
come into circulation, it changes society.

64
0:03:04.727,000 --> 0:03:07,000
What they got exactly wrong was what happens next.

65
0:03:08.259,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The more ideas there are in circulation,

66
0:03:10.808,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the more ideas there are for any individual to disagree with.

67
0:03:15.516,000 --> 0:03:19,000
More media always means more arguing.

68
0:03:20.289,000 --> 0:03:22,000
That's what happens when the media's space expands.

69
0:03:23.209,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And yet, when we look back on the printing press

70
0:03:26.112,000 --> 0:03:29,000
in the early years, we like what happened.

71
0:03:29.491,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We are a pro-printing press society.

72
0:03:32.735,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So how do we square those two things,

73
0:03:34.705,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that it leads to more arguing, but we think it was good?

74
0:03:37.461,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And the answer, I think, can be found in things like this.

75
0:03:40.06,000 --> 0:03:43,000
This is the cover of "Philosophical Transactions,"

76
0:03:43.345,000 --> 0:03:45,000
the first scientific journal ever published in English

77
0:03:45.967,000 --> 0:03:46,000
in the middle of the 1600s,

78
0:03:47.849,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and it was created by a group of people who had been

79
0:03:49.676,000 --> 0:03:5,000
calling themselves "The Invisible College,"

80
0:03:51.313,000 --> 0:03:53,000
a group of natural philosophers who only later

81
0:03:53.517,000 --> 0:03:55,000
would call themselves scientists,

82
0:03:56.122,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and they wanted to improve the way

83
0:03:59.666,000 --> 0:04:01,000
natural philosophers argued with each other,

84
0:04:02.323,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and they needed to do two things for this.

85
0:04:04.313,000 --> 0:04:06,000
They needed openness. They needed to create a norm

86
0:04:06.797,000 --> 0:04:07,000
which said, when you do an experiment,

87
0:04:08.656,000 --> 0:04:1,000
you have to publish not just your claims,

88
0:04:11.341,000 --> 0:04:12,000
but how you did the experiment.

89
0:04:12.767,000 --> 0:04:14,000
If you don't tell us how you did it, we won't trust you.

90
0:04:15.564,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But the other thing they needed was speed.

91
0:04:17.924,000 --> 0:04:19,000
They had to quickly synchronize what

92
0:04:20.229,000 --> 0:04:22,000
other natural philosophers knew. Otherwise,

93
0:04:22.683,000 --> 0:04:24,000
you couldn't get the right kind of argument going.

94
0:04:25.54,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The printing press was clearly the right medium for this,

95
0:04:28.49,000 --> 0:04:3,000
but the book was the wrong tool. It was too slow.

96
0:04:31.076,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And so they invented the scientific journal

97
0:04:33.938,000 --> 0:04:35,000
as a way of synchronizing the argument

98
0:04:36.724,000 --> 0:04:38,000
across the community of natural scientists.

99
0:04:39.278,000 --> 0:04:42,000
The scientific revolution wasn't created by the printing press.

100
0:04:42.776,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It was created by scientists,

101
0:04:44.922,000 --> 0:04:45,000
but it couldn't have been created if they didn't have

102
0:04:46.781,000 --> 0:04:48,000
a printing press as a tool.

103
0:04:48.951,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So what about us? What about our generation,

104
0:04:51.191,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and our media revolution, the Internet?

105
0:04:53.194,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Well, predictions of world peace? Check. (Laughter)

106
0:04:57.313,000 --> 0:05:05,000
More arguing? Gold star on that one. (Laughter)

107
0:05:05.896,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:07.207,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I mean, YouTube is just a gold mine. (Laughter)

109
0:05:11.554,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Better arguing? That's the question.

110
0:05:15.649,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So I study social media, which means,

111
0:05:17.693,000 --> 0:05:19,000
to a first approximation, I watch people argue.

112
0:05:20.304,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And if I had to pick a group that I think is

113
0:05:24.411,000 --> 0:05:27,000
our Invisible College, is our generation's collection of people

114
0:05:28.204,000 --> 0:05:31,000
trying to take these tools and to press it into service,

115
0:05:31.363,000 --> 0:05:33,000
not for more arguments, but for better arguments,

116
0:05:34.144,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I'd pick the open-source programmers.

117
0:05:36.539,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Programming is a three-way relationship

118
0:05:38.801,000 --> 0:05:4,000
between a programmer, some source code,

119
0:05:41.085,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and the computer it's meant to run on, but computers

120
0:05:43.699,000 --> 0:05:47,000
are such famously inflexible interpreters of instructions

121
0:05:48.401,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that it's extraordinarily difficult to write out a set

122
0:05:52.424,000 --> 0:05:55,000
of instructions that the computer knows how to execute,

123
0:05:55.462,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and that's if one person is writing it.

124
0:05:57.328,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Once you get more than one person writing it,

125
0:05:59.427,000 --> 0:06:02,000
it's very easy for any two programmers to overwrite

126
0:06:02.511,000 --> 0:06:04,000
each other's work if they're working on the same file,

127
0:06:05.172,000 --> 0:06:07,000
or to send incompatible instructions

128
0:06:07.354,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that simply causes the computer to choke,

129
0:06:09.795,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and this problem grows larger

130
0:06:12.754,000 --> 0:06:14,000
the more programmers are involved.

131
0:06:15.523,000 --> 0:06:18,000
To a first approximation, the problem of managing

132
0:06:18.87,000 --> 0:06:2,000
a large software project is the problem

133
0:06:21.596,000 --> 0:06:24,000
of keeping this social chaos at bay.

134
0:06:25.252,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Now, for decades there has been a canonical solution

135
0:06:27.727,000 --> 0:06:28,000
to this problem, which is to use something called

136
0:06:29.381,000 --> 0:06:3,000
a "version control system,"

137
0:06:31.361,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and a version control system does what is says on the tin.

138
0:06:33.57,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It provides a canonical copy of the software

139
0:06:36.964,000 --> 0:06:37,000
on a server somewhere.

140
0:06:38.516,000 --> 0:06:4,000
The only programmers who can change it are people

141
0:06:41.422,000 --> 0:06:44,000
who've specifically been given permission to access it,

142
0:06:44.953,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and they're only allowed to access the sub-section of it

143
0:06:48.72,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that they have permission to change.

144
0:06:51.15,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And when people draw diagrams of version control systems,

145
0:06:54.335,000 --> 0:06:56,000
the diagrams always look something like this.

146
0:06:56.7,000 --> 0:06:58,000
All right. They look like org charts.

147
0:06:59.578,000 --> 0:07:,000
And you don't have to squint very hard

148
0:07:00.985,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to see the political ramifications of a system like this.

149
0:07:04.45,000 --> 0:07:08,000
This is feudalism: one owner, many workers.

150
0:07:08.926,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Now, that's fine for the commercial software industry.

151
0:07:12.25,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It really is Microsoft's Office. It's Adobe's Photoshop.

152
0:07:17.64,000 --> 0:07:19,000
The corporation owns the software.

153
0:07:20.472,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The programmers come and go.

154
0:07:22.786,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But there was one programmer who decided

155
0:07:26.159,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that this wasn't the way to work.

156
0:07:29.147,000 --> 0:07:3,000
This is Linus Torvalds.

157
0:07:30.409,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Torvalds is the most famous open-source programmer,

158
0:07:32.561,000 --> 0:07:37,000
created Linux, obviously, and Torvalds looked at the way

159
0:07:37.862,000 --> 0:07:4,000
the open-source movement had been dealing with this problem.

160
0:07:41.374,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Open-source software, the core promise of the open-source license,

161
0:07:45.998,000 --> 0:07:48,000
is that everybody should have access to all the source code

162
0:07:49.744,000 --> 0:07:52,000
all the time, but of course, this creates

163
0:07:52.997,000 --> 0:07:55,000
the very threat of chaos you have to forestall

164
0:07:56.304,000 --> 0:07:57,000
in order to get anything working.

165
0:07:57.882,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So most open-source projects just held their noses

166
0:08:00.364,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and adopted the feudal management systems.

167
0:08:03.044,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But Torvalds said, "No, I'm not going to do that."

168
0:08:05.552,000 --> 0:08:08,000
His point of view on this was very clear.

169
0:08:09.117,000 --> 0:08:11,000
When you adopt a tool, you also adopt

170
0:08:11.65,000 --> 0:08:14,000
the management philosophy embedded in that tool,

171
0:08:15.239,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and he wasn't going to adopt anything that didn't work

172
0:08:18.375,000 --> 0:08:2,000
the way the Linux community worked.

173
0:08:20.684,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And to give you a sense of how enormous

174
0:08:23.216,000 --> 0:08:26,000
a decision like this was, this is a map

175
0:08:26.884,000 --> 0:08:29,000
of the internal dependencies within Linux,

176
0:08:30.373,000 --> 0:08:32,000
within the Linux operating system, which sub-parts

177
0:08:32.98,000 --> 0:08:36,000
of the program rely on which other sub-parts to get going.

178
0:08:37.425,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This is a tremendously complicated process.

179
0:08:41.003,000 --> 0:08:43,000
This is a tremendously complicated program,

180
0:08:43.795,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and yet, for years, Torvalds ran this

181
0:08:46.46,000 --> 0:08:49,000
not with automated tools but out of his email box.

182
0:08:50.364,000 --> 0:08:52,000
People would literally mail him changes

183
0:08:52.837,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that they'd agreed on, and he would merge them by hand.

184
0:08:56.956,000 --> 0:09:,000
And then, 15 years after looking at Linux and figuring out

185
0:09:01.702,000 --> 0:09:03,000
how the community worked, he said, "I think I know

186
0:09:04.512,000 --> 0:09:08,000
how to write a version control system for free people."

187
0:09:08.679,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And he called it "Git." Git is distributed version control.

188
0:09:14.574,000 --> 0:09:17,000
It has two big differences

189
0:09:17.598,000 --> 0:09:19,000
with traditional version control systems.

190
0:09:19.661,000 --> 0:09:22,000
The first is that it lives up to the philosophical promise

191
0:09:22.808,000 --> 0:09:25,000
of open-source. Everybody who works on a project

192
0:09:26.094,000 --> 0:09:29,000
has access to all of the source code all of the time.

193
0:09:29.765,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And when people draw diagrams of Git workflow,

194
0:09:32.439,000 --> 0:09:34,000
they use drawings that look like this.

195
0:09:35.376,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And you don't have to understand what the circles

196
0:09:37.694,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and boxes and arrows mean to see that this is a far more

197
0:09:41.373,000 --> 0:09:44,000
complicated way of working than is supported

198
0:09:44.468,000 --> 0:09:46,000
by ordinary version control systems.

199
0:09:47.189,000 --> 0:09:51,000
But this is also the thing that brings the chaos back,

200
0:09:51.498,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and this is Git's second big innovation.

201
0:09:54.548,000 --> 0:09:57,000
This is a screenshot from GitHub, the premier Git hosting service,

202
0:09:58.544,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and every time a programmer uses Git

203
0:10:01.894,000 --> 0:10:04,000
to make any important change at all,

204
0:10:05.055,000 --> 0:10:08,000
creating a new file, modifying an existing one,

205
0:10:08.364,000 --> 0:10:12,000
merging two files, Git creates this kind of signature.

206
0:10:13.038,000 --> 0:10:16,000
This long string of numbers and letters here

207
0:10:16.181,000 --> 0:10:21,000
is a unique identifier tied to every single change,

208
0:10:21.256,000 --> 0:10:23,000
but without any central coordination.

209
0:10:24.113,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Every Git system generates this number the same way,

210
0:10:28.602,000 --> 0:10:31,000
which means this is a signature tied directly

211
0:10:31.944,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and unforgeably to a particular change.

212
0:10:35.094,000 --> 0:10:36,000
This has the following effect:

213
0:10:37.03,000 --> 0:10:4,000
A programmer in Edinburgh and a programmer in Entebbe

214
0:10:40.708,000 --> 0:10:43,000
can both get the same -- a copy of the same piece of software.

215
0:10:44.41,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Each of them can make changes and they can merge them

216
0:10:48.236,000 --> 0:10:5,000
after the fact even if they didn't know

217
0:10:51.171,000 --> 0:10:53,000
of each other's existence beforehand.

218
0:10:54.13,000 --> 0:10:57,000
This is cooperation without coordination.

219
0:10:57.629,000 --> 0:10:59,000
This is the big change.

220
0:11:00.565,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Now, I tell you all of this not to convince you that it's great

221
0:11:05.775,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that open-source programmers now have a tool

222
0:11:09.472,000 --> 0:11:12,000
that supports their philosophical way of working,

223
0:11:12.565,000 --> 0:11:14,000
although I think that is great.

224
0:11:14.669,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I tell you all of this because of what I think it means

225
0:11:17.437,000 --> 0:11:19,000
for the way communities come together.

226
0:11:19.631,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Once Git allowed for cooperation without coordination,

227
0:11:25.95,000 --> 0:11:27,000
you start to see communities form

228
0:11:28.89,000 --> 0:11:32,000
that are enormously large and complex.

229
0:11:33.142,000 --> 0:11:35,000
This is a graph of the Ruby community.

230
0:11:35.421,000 --> 0:11:36,000
It's an open-source programming language,

231
0:11:36.95,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and all of the interconnections between the people --

232
0:11:39.948,000 --> 0:11:41,000
this is now not a software graph, but a people graph,

233
0:11:42.347,000 --> 0:11:44,000
all of the interconnections among the people

234
0:11:44.449,000 --> 0:11:46,000
working on that project —

235
0:11:46.792,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and this doesn't look like an org chart.

236
0:11:49.782,000 --> 0:11:52,000
This looks like a dis-org chart, and yet,

237
0:11:53.202,000 --> 0:11:55,000
out of this community, but using these tools,

238
0:11:55.81,000 --> 0:11:57,000
they can now create something together.

239
0:11:58.096,000 --> 0:12:02,000
So there are two good reasons to think that

240
0:12:02.461,000 --> 0:12:06,000
this kind of technique can be applied

241
0:12:06.634,000 --> 0:12:1,000
to democracies in general and in particular to the law.

242
0:12:11.167,000 --> 0:12:12,000
When you make the claim, in fact,

243
0:12:13.025,000 --> 0:12:15,000
that something on the Internet is going to be good

244
0:12:15.983,000 --> 0:12:17,000
for democracy, you often get this reaction.

245
0:12:18.424,000 --> 0:12:23,000
(Music) (Laughter)

246
0:12:24.348,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Which is, are you talking about the thing

247
0:12:26.874,000 --> 0:12:28,000
with the singing cats? Like, is that the thing

248
0:12:29.285,000 --> 0:12:31,000
you think is going to be good for society?

249
0:12:31.914,000 --> 0:12:33,000
To which I have to say, here's the thing

250
0:12:34.049,000 --> 0:12:37,000
with the singing cats. That always happens.

251
0:12:37.41,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And I don't just mean that always happens with the Internet,

252
0:12:39.143,000 --> 0:12:41,000
I mean that always happens with media, full stop.

253
0:12:41.723,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It did not take long after the rise

254
0:12:43.763,000 --> 0:12:45,000
of the commercial printing press before someone

255
0:12:46.439,000 --> 0:12:49,000
figured out that erotic novels were a good idea. (Laughter)

256
0:12:49.752,000 --> 0:12:52,000
You don't have to have an economic incentive to sell books

257
0:12:52.794,000 --> 0:12:55,000
very long before someone says, "Hey, you know what I bet

258
0:12:55.815,000 --> 0:12:57,000
people would pay for?" (Laughter)

259
0:12:57.983,000 --> 0:13:,000
It took people another 150 years to even think

260
0:13:01.533,000 --> 0:13:07,000
of the scientific journal, right? So -- (Laughter) (Applause)

261
0:13:08.293,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So the harnessing by the Invisible College

262
0:13:11.331,000 --> 0:13:13,000
of the printing press to create the scientific journal

263
0:13:13.716,000 --> 0:13:15,000
was phenomenally important, but it didn't happen big,

264
0:13:16.627,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and it didn't happen quick, and it didn't happen fast, so

265
0:13:19.386,000 --> 0:13:22,000
if you're going to look for where the change is happening,

266
0:13:22.684,000 --> 0:13:24,000
you have to look on the margins.

267
0:13:24.7,000 --> 0:13:29,000
So, the law is also dependency-related.

268
0:13:30.164,000 --> 0:13:33,000
This is a graph of the U.S. Tax Code,

269
0:13:33.573,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and the dependencies of one law on other laws

270
0:13:36.653,000 --> 0:13:38,000
for the overall effect.

271
0:13:39.051,000 --> 0:13:42,000
So there's that as a site for source code management.

272
0:13:42.483,000 --> 0:13:43,000
But there's also the fact that law is another place

273
0:13:44.385,000 --> 0:13:46,000
where there are many opinions in circulation,

274
0:13:46.659,000 --> 0:13:49,000
but they need to be resolved to one canonical copy,

275
0:13:50.167,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and when you go onto GitHub, and you look around,

276
0:13:52.744,000 --> 0:13:54,000
there are millions and millions of projects,

277
0:13:54.813,000 --> 0:13:55,000
almost all of which are source code,

278
0:13:56.167,000 --> 0:13:58,000
but if you look around the edges, you can see people

279
0:13:58.852,000 --> 0:14:,000
experimenting with the political ramifications

280
0:14:01.061,000 --> 0:14:02,000
of a system like that.

281
0:14:02.674,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Someone put up all the Wikileaked cables

282
0:14:04.484,000 --> 0:14:06,000
from the State Department, along with software used

283
0:14:06.749,000 --> 0:14:09,000
to interpret them, including my favorite use ever

284
0:14:09.938,000 --> 0:14:11,000
of the Cablegate cables, which is a tool for detecting

285
0:14:12.309,000 --> 0:14:15,000
naturally occurring haiku in State Department prose.

286
0:14:15.324,000 --> 0:14:2,000
(Laughter)

287
0:14:21.22,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Right. (Laughter)

288
0:14:24.292,000 --> 0:14:26,000
The New York Senate has put up something called

289
0:14:27.091,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Open Legislation, also hosting it on GitHub,

290
0:14:29.498,000 --> 0:14:31,000
again for all of the reasons of updating and fluidity.

291
0:14:31.884,000 --> 0:14:33,000
You can go and pick your Senator and then you can see

292
0:14:34.55,000 --> 0:14:36,000
a list of bills they have sponsored.

293
0:14:36.585,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Someone going by Divegeek has put up the Utah code,

294
0:14:40.217,000 --> 0:14:42,000
the laws of the state of Utah, and they've put it up there

295
0:14:42.982,000 --> 0:14:43,000
not just to distribute the code,

296
0:14:44.431,000 --> 0:14:47,000
but with the very interesting possibility that this could

297
0:14:47.629,000 --> 0:14:51,000
be used to further the development of legislation.

298
0:14:52.184,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Somebody put up a tool during the copyright debate

299
0:14:56.023,000 --> 0:15:,000
last year in the Senate, saying, "It's strange that Hollywood

300
0:15:00.209,000 --> 0:15:03,000
has more access to Canadian legislators

301
0:15:03.333,000 --> 0:15:06,000
than Canadian citizens do. Why don't we use GitHub

302
0:15:07.149,000 --> 0:15:11,000
to show them what a citizen-developed bill might look like?"

303
0:15:11.625,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And it includes this very evocative screenshot.

304
0:15:15.377,000 --> 0:15:17,000
This is a called a "diff," this thing on the right here.

305
0:15:18.355,000 --> 0:15:2,000
This shows you, for text that many people are editing,

306
0:15:21.325,000 --> 0:15:23,000
when a change was made, who made it,

307
0:15:23.526,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and what the change is.

308
0:15:24.529,000 --> 0:15:25,000
The stuff in red is the stuff that got deleted.

309
0:15:25.984,000 --> 0:15:27,000
The stuff in green is the stuff that got added.

310
0:15:28.676,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Programmers take this capability for granted.

311
0:15:31.458,000 --> 0:15:33,000
No democracy anywhere in the world offers this feature

312
0:15:34.383,000 --> 0:15:37,000
to its citizens for either legislation or for budgets,

313
0:15:38.198,000 --> 0:15:4,000
even though those are the things done

314
0:15:40.728,000 --> 0:15:43,000
with our consent and with our money.

315
0:15:43.867,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Now, I would love to tell you that the fact

316
0:15:47.105,000 --> 0:15:5,000
that the open-source programmers have worked out

317
0:15:50.277,000 --> 0:15:53,000
a collaborative method that is large scale, distributed,

318
0:15:53.948,000 --> 0:15:56,000
cheap, and in sync with the ideals of democracy, I would love

319
0:15:57.413,000 --> 0:15:59,000
to tell you that because those tools are in place,

320
0:15:59.584,000 --> 0:16:03,000
the innovation is inevitable. But it's not.

321
0:16:03.915,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Part of the problem, of course, is just a lack of information.

322
0:16:06.908,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Somebody put a question up on Quora saying,

323
0:16:08.811,000 --> 0:16:1,000
"Why is it that lawmakers don't use

324
0:16:10.903,000 --> 0:16:11,000
distributed version control?"

325
0:16:12.31,000 --> 0:16:15,000
This, graphically, was the answer. (Laughter)

326
0:16:15.931,000 --> 0:16:17,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

327
0:16:18.022,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And that is indeed part of the problem, but only part.

328
0:16:23.044,000 --> 0:16:26,000
The bigger problem, of course, is power.

329
0:16:26.221,000 --> 0:16:29,000
The people experimenting with participation don't have

330
0:16:29.391,000 --> 0:16:31,000
legislative power, and the people who have legislative

331
0:16:31.96,000 --> 0:16:34,000
power are not experimenting with participation.

332
0:16:35.923,000 --> 0:16:36,000
They are experimenting with openness.

333
0:16:37.468,000 --> 0:16:38,000
There's no democracy worth the name that doesn't have

334
0:16:39.328,000 --> 0:16:41,000
a transparency move, but transparency is openness

335
0:16:42.256,000 --> 0:16:45,000
in only one direction, and being given a dashboard

336
0:16:46.161,000 --> 0:16:49,000
without a steering wheel has never been the core promise

337
0:16:49.331,000 --> 0:16:52,000
a democracy makes to its citizens.

338
0:16:52.742,000 --> 0:16:54,000
So consider this.

339
0:16:55.092,000 --> 0:16:57,000
The thing that got Martha Payne's opinions

340
0:16:57.678,000 --> 0:17:,000
out into the public was a piece of technology,

341
0:17:01.369,000 --> 0:17:04,000
but the thing that kept them there was political will.

342
0:17:05.003,000 --> 0:17:07,000
It was the expectation of the citizens

343
0:17:07.277,000 --> 0:17:1,000
that she would not be censored.

344
0:17:10.812,000 --> 0:17:15,000
That's now the state we're in with these collaboration tools.

345
0:17:16.14,000 --> 0:17:2,000
We have them. We've seen them. They work.

346
0:17:20.147,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Can we use them?

347
0:17:21.198,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Can we apply the techniques that worked here to this?

348
0:17:26.324,000 --> 0:17:29,000
T.S. Eliot once said, "One of the most momentous things

349
0:17:30.041,000 --> 0:17:32,000
that can happen to a culture

350
0:17:32.121,000 --> 0:17:35,000
is that they acquire a new form of prose."

351
0:17:35.764,000 --> 0:17:37,000
I think that's wrong, but -- (Laughter)

352
0:17:38.012,000 --> 0:17:41,000
I think it's right for argumentation. Right?

353
0:17:41.671,000 --> 0:17:44,000
A momentous thing that can happen to a culture

354
0:17:45.026,000 --> 0:17:47,000
is they can acquire a new style of arguing:

355
0:17:47.84,000 --> 0:17:53,000
trial by jury, voting, peer review, now this. Right?

356
0:17:54.556,000 --> 0:17:57,000
A new form of arguing has been invented in our lifetimes,

357
0:17:57.625,000 --> 0:17:58,000
in the last decade, in fact.

358
0:17:59.512,000 --> 0:18:03,000
It's large, it's distributed, it's low-cost,

359
0:18:03.565,000 --> 0:18:06,000
and it's compatible with the ideals of democracy.

360
0:18:06.864,000 --> 0:18:07,000
The question for us now is, are we going to let

361
0:18:08.85,000 --> 0:18:09,000
the programmers keep it to themselves?

362
0:18:10.376,000 --> 0:18:12,000
Or are we going to try and take it and press it into service

363
0:18:12.425,000 --> 0:18:14,000
for society at large?

364
0:18:14.577,000 --> 0:18:16,000
Thank you for listening. (Applause)

365
0:18:17.177,000 --> 0:18:21,000
(Applause)

366
0:18:21.315,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

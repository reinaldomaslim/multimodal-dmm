1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
By birth and by choice,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I've been involved with the auto industry my entire life,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and for the past 30 years,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I've worked at Ford Motor Company.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And for most of those years,

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I worried about,

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
how am I going to sell more cars and trucks?

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But today I worry about,

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks?

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
What happens

11
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
when the number of vehicles on the road doubles, triples,

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
or even quadruples?

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
My life is guided by two great passions,

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and the first is automobiles.

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company.

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I thought it was so cool as a little boy

17
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
when my dad would bring home the latest Ford or Lincoln

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and leave it in the driveway.

19
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And I decided about that time, about age 10,

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that it would be really cool if I was a test driver.

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So my parents would go to dinner.

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
They'd sit down; I'd sneak out of the house.

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I'd jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway,

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and it was a blast.

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And that went on for about two years,

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
until -- I think I was about 12 --

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
my dad brought home

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
a Lincoln Mark III.

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And it was snowing that day.

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So he and mom went to dinner,

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and I snuck out

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and thought it'd be really cool to do donuts

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
or even some figure-eights in the snow.

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
My dad finished dinner early that evening.

35
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And he was walking to the front hall

36
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and out the front door

37
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
just about the same time I hit some ice

38
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and met him at the front door with the car --

39
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and almost ended up in the front hall.

40
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while.

41
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But I really began to love cars then.

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And my first car was a 1975 electric-green Mustang.

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And even though the color was pretty hideous,

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I did love the car,

45
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
and it really cemented my love affair with cars

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that's continued on to this day.

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
But cars are really more than a passion of mine;

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
they're quite literally in my blood.

49
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
My great grandfather was Henry Ford,

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and on my mother's side,

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
my great grandfather was Harvey Firestone.

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So when I was born,

53
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me.

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But my great grandfather, Henry Ford,

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
really believed that the mission of the Ford Motor Company

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
was to make people's lives better

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them.

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Because he believed that with mobility

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
comes freedom and progress.

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And that's a belief that I share.

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
My other great passion is the environment.

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And as a young boy, I used to go up to Northern Michigan

63
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and then later wrote about.

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And it really struck me

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
as the years went by,

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
in a very negative way,

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
when I would go to some stream that I'd loved,

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and was used to walking through this field

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that was once filled with fireflies,

71
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it.

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And so even at a young age,

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that really resonated with me,

74
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and the whole notion of environmental preservation,

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
at a very basic level, sunk in with me.

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
As a high-schooler, I started to read

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold

78
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and Edward Abbey,

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and I really began to develop

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
a deeper appreciation of the natural world.

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But it never really occurred to me

82
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that my love of cars and trucks

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
would ever be in conflict with nature.

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And that was true

85
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
until I got to college.

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And when I got to college, you can imagine my surprise

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
when I would go to class

88
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and a number of my professors would say

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that Ford Motor Company and my family

90
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
was everything that was wrong with our country.

91
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
They thought that we were more interested, as an industry,

92
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
in profits, rather than progress,

93
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and that we filled the skies with smog --

94
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and frankly, we were the enemy.

95
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I joined Ford after college,

96
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
after some soul searching

97
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
whether or not this is really the right thing to do.

98
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But I decided that I wanted to go

99
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and see if I could affect change there.

100
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And as I look back over 30 years ago,

101
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
it was a little naive to think at that age

102
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that I could. But I wanted to.

103
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And I really discovered

104
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that my professors weren't completely wrong.

105
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
In fact, when I got back to Detroit,

106
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
my environmental leanings weren't exactly embraced

107
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
by those in my own company,

108
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and certainly by those in the industry.

109
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I had some very interesting conversations,

110
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
as you can imagine.

111
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
There were some within Ford

112
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
who believed that all this ecological nonsense

113
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
should just disappear

114
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and that I needed to stop hanging out

115
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
with "environmental wackos."

116
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I was considered a radical.

117
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management

118
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
and told to stop associating

119
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
with any known or suspected environmentalists.

120
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Laughter)

121
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Of course, I had no intention of doing that,

122
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and I kept speaking out about the environment,

123
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and it really was the topic

124
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that we now today call sustainability.

125
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And in time, my views went from controversial

126
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
to more or less consensus today.

127
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I mean, I think most people in the industry

128
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
understand that we've got to get on with it.

129
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And the good news is today we are tackling the big issues,

130
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
of cars and the environment --

131
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
not only at Ford, but really as an industry.

132
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights.

133
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And with new technology,

134
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
we're reducing -- and I believe, someday we'll eliminate --

135
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
CO2 emissions.

136
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
We're starting to sell electric cars, which is great.

137
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
We're developing alternative powertrains

138
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that are going to make cars affordable

139
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
in every sense of the word --

140
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
economically, socially

141
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and environmentally.

142
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And actually, although we've got a long way to go

143
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and a lot of work to do,

144
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I can see the day where my two great passions --

145
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
cars and the environment --

146
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
actually come into harmony.

147
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
But unfortunately,

148
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
as we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem --

149
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and as I said, we're not there yet; we've got a lot of work to do,

150
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
but I can see where we will --

151
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but even as we're in the process of doing that,

152
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
another huge problem is looming,

153
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and people aren't noticing.

154
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And that is the freedom of mobility

155
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that my great grandfather brought to people

156
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is now being threatened, just as the environment is.

157
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
The problem, put in its simplest terms,

158
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
is one of mathematics.

159
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world,

160
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and within our lifetime, that number's going to grow

161
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
to about nine billion.

162
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And at that population level,

163
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth.

164
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And with that growth

165
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
comes some severe practical problems,

166
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
one of which is our transportation system

167
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
simply won't be able to deal with it.

168
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
When we look at the population growth in terms of cars,

169
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
it becomes even clearer.

170
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide.

171
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But with more people

172
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and greater prosperity around the world,

173
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that number's going to grow

174
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to between two and four billion cars by mid century.

175
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And this is going to create the kind of global gridlock

176
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that the world has never seen before.

177
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Now think about the impact

178
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that this is going to have on our daily lives.

179
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Today the average American

180
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
spends about a week a year

181
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
stuck in traffic jams,

182
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and that's a huge waste of time and resources.

183
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
But that's nothing compared

184
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to what's going on

185
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
in the nations that are growing the fastest.

186
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Today the average driver in Beijing

187
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
has a five-hour commute.

188
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And last summer -- many of you probably saw this --

189
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
there was a hundred-mile traffic jam

190
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that took 11 days to clear in China.

191
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
In the decades to come,

192
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
75 percent of the world's population

193
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
will live in cities,

194
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and 50 of those cities

195
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
will be of 10 million people or more.

196
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So you can see the size of the issue that we're facing.

197
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
When you factor in population growth,

198
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
it's clear that the mobility model that we have today

199
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
simply will not work tomorrow.

200
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Frankly, four billion clean cars on the road

201
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
are still four billion cars,

202
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and a traffic jam with no emissions

203
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
is still a traffic jam.

204
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So, if we make no changes today,

205
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
what does tomorrow look like?

206
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Well I think you probably already have the picture.

207
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge,

208
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and they're really very, very inconvenient,

209
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
but that's all they are.

210
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
But the bigger issue

211
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
is that global gridlock

212
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
is going to stifle economic growth

213
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and our ability to deliver

214
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
food and health care,

215
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
particularly to people that live in city centers.

216
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
And our quality of life is going to be severely compromised.

217
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So what's going to solve this?

218
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Well the answer isn't going to be more of the same.

219
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
My great grandfather once said

220
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
before he invented the Model T,

221
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
"If I had asked people then what they wanted,

222
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
they would have answered,

223
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
'We want faster horses.'"

224
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So the answer to more cars

225
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
is simply not to have more roads.

226
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
When America began moving west,

227
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
we didn't add more wagon trains,

228
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
we built railroads.

229
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And to connect our country after World War II,

230
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
we didn't build more two-lane highways,

231
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
we built the interstate highway system.

232
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Today we need that same leap in thinking

233
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
for us to create a viable future.

234
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
We are going to build smart cars,

235
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but we also need to build

236
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
smart roads, smart parking,

237
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
smart public transportation systems and more.

238
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
We don't want to waste our time

239
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
sitting in traffic, sitting at tollbooths

240
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
or looking for parking spots.

241
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We need an integrated system

242
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
that uses real time data

243
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale

244
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
without hassle or compromises for travelers.

245
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And frankly, that's the kind of system

246
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable.

247
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Now the good news is some of this work has already begun

248
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
in different parts of the world.

249
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
The city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi

250
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
uses driverless electric vehicles

251
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that can communicate with one another,

252
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and they go underneath the city streets.

253
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And up above, you've got a series of pedestrian walkways.

254
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
On New York City's 34th Street,

255
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
gridlock will soon be replaced

256
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
with a connected system

257
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
of vehicle-specific corridors.

258
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created,

259
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and all of this will cut down the average rush hour commute

260
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
to get across town in New York

261
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
from about an hour today at rush hour

262
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to about 20 minutes.

263
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Now if you look at Hong Kong,

264
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
they have a very interesting system called Octopus there.

265
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
It's a system that really ties together

266
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
all the transportation assets

267
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
into a single payment system.

268
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So parking garages, buses, trains,

269
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
they all operate within the same system.

270
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Now shared car services

271
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
are also springing up around the world,

272
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and these efforts, I think, are great.

273
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
They're relieving congestion,

274
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and they're frankly starting to save some fuel.

275
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
These are all really good ideas

276
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that will move us forward.

277
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
But what really inspires me

278
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
is what's going to be possible

279
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
when our cars can begin talking to each other.

280
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Very soon, the same systems that we use today

281
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
to bring music and entertainment

282
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and GPS information into our vehicles

283
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
are going to be used to create

284
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
a smart vehicle network.

285
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Every morning I drive about 30 miles

286
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn, Michigan.

287
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And every night I go home,

288
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
my commute is a total crapshoot.

289
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And I often have to leave the freeway

290
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and look for different ways

291
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
for me to try and make it home.

292
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
But very soon we're going to see the days

293
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
when cars are essentially talking to each other.

294
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
So if the car ahead of me on I-94 hits traffic,

295
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
it will immediately alert my car

296
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and tell my car to reroute itself

297
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
to get me home in the best possible way.

298
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And these systems are being tested right now,

299
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and frankly they're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon.

300
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
But the potential of a connected car network

301
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
is almost limitless.

302
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So just imagine:

303
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
one day very soon,

304
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
you're going to be able to plan a trip downtown

305
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and your car will be connected to a smart parking system.

306
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So you get in your car,

307
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and as you get in your car,

308
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive --

309
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
no more driving around looking for one,

310
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel

311
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
in today's cars in urban areas --

312
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
is looking for parking spots.

313
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Or think about being in New York City

314
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone

315
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
so you don't have to wait in the cold to hail one.

316
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Or being at a future TED Conference

317
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
and having your car

318
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
talk to the calendars of everybody here

319
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and telling you all the best route to take home

320
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and when you should leave

321
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time.

322
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
This is the kind of technology

323
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
that will merge millions of individual vehicles

324
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
into a single system.

325
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So I think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution

326
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
to this enormous problem.

327
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
But as we found out with addressing CO2 issues,

328
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and also fossil fuels,

329
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
there is no one silver bullet.

330
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
The solution is not going to be

331
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
more cars, more roads or a new rail system;

332
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
it can only be found, I believe,

333
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
in a global network

334
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
of interconnected solutions.

335
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Now I know we can develop the technology

336
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that's going to make this work,

337
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
but we've got to be willing to get out there

338
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and seek out the solutions --

339
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation

340
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
or some other way we haven't even thought of yet;

341
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
our overall transportation-mix and infrastructure

342
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
must support all the future options.

343
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
We need our best and our brightest

344
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
to start entertaining this issue.

345
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Companies, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists,

346
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
they all need to understand

347
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
this is a huge business opportunity,

348
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
as well as an enormous social problem.

349
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And just as these groups

350
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
embrace the green energy challenge --

351
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and it's really been amazing to me to watch

352
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
how much brain power, how much money

353
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and how much serious thought

354
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
has, really over the last three years,

355
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
just poured into the green energy field.

356
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
We need that same kind of passion and energy

357
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
to attack global gridlock.

358
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
But we need people like all of you in this room,

359
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
leading thinkers.

360
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
I mean, frankly, I need all of you

361
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
to think about how

362
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
you can help solve this huge issue.

363
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And we need people from all walks of life;

364
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
not just inventors, we need policymakers

365
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and government officials

366
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
to also think about how they're going to respond to this challenge.

367
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
This isn't going to be solved

368
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
by any one person or one group.

369
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
It's going to really require a national energy policy,

370
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
frankly for each country,

371
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
because the solutions in each country are going to be different

372
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
based upon income levels, traffic jams

373
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and also how integrated

374
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
the systems already are.

375
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
But we need to get going, and we need to get going today.

376
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And we must have an infrastructure

377
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
that's designed to support

378
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
this flexible future.

379
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
You know, we've come a long way.

380
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Since the Model T,

381
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
most people never traveled

382
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
more than 25 miles from home in their entire lifetime.

383
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
And since then,

384
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
the automobile has allowed us the freedom

385
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
to choose where we live, where we work,

386
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
where we play

387
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and frankly when we just go out and want to move around.

388
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
We don't want to regress and lose that freedom.

389
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
We're on our way to solving --

390
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and as I said earlier, I know we've got a long way to go --

391
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it,

392
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and that's the environmental issue,

393
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
but I believe we all must turn

394
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination

395
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
to help now solve this notion of global gridlock.

396
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Because in doing so,

397
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
we're going to preserve what we've really come to take for granted,

398
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
which is the freedom to move

399
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and move very effortlessly around the world.

400
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And it frankly will enhance our quality of life

401
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
if we fix this.

402
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Because, if you can envision, as I do,

403
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
a future of zero emissions

404
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and freedom to move around the country and around the world

405
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
like we take for granted today,

406
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
that's worth the hard work today

407
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
to preserve that for tomorrow.

408
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
I believe we're at our best

409
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
when we're confronted with big issues.

410
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
This is a big one, and it won't wait.

411
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
So let's get started now.

412
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Thank you.

413
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
(Applause)

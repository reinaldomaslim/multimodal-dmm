1
0:00:16.45,000 --> 0:00:17,000
For as long as I can remember,

2
0:00:18.45,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I have felt a very deep connection to animals and to the ocean.

3
0:00:23.069,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And at this age, my personal idol was Flipper the dolphin.

4
0:00:28.526,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And when I first learned about endangered species,

5
0:00:31.393,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I was truly distressed to know that every day,

6
0:00:35.107,000 --> 0:00:38,000
animals were being wiped off the face of this Earth forever.

7
0:00:38.655,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And I wanted to do something to help, but I always wondered:

8
0:00:41.686,000 --> 0:00:44,000
What could one person possibly do to make a difference?

9
0:00:45.542,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And it would be 30 years,

10
0:00:47.577,000 --> 0:00:49,000
but I would eventually get the answer to that question.

11
0:00:51.389,000 --> 0:00:54,000
When these heartbreaking images of oiled birds

12
0:00:54.555,000 --> 0:00:57,000
finally began to emerge from the Gulf of Mexico last year

13
0:00:57.657,000 --> 0:00:59,000
during the horrific BP oil spill,

14
0:01:00.006,000 --> 0:01:04,000
a German biologist by the name of Silvia Gaus was quoted as saying,

15
0:01:04.114,000 --> 0:01:06,000
"We should just euthanize all oiled birds,

16
0:01:06.822,000 --> 0:01:07,000
because studies have shown

17
0:01:08.146,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that fewer than one percent of them survive after being released."

18
0:01:13.142,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And I could not disagree more.

19
0:01:15.698,000 --> 0:01:16,000
In addition,

20
0:01:17.009,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I believe that every oiled animal deserves a second chance at life.

21
0:01:20.984,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And I want to tell you why I feel so strongly about this.

22
0:01:24.464,000 --> 0:01:26,000
On June 23, 2000,

23
0:01:26.521,000 --> 0:01:29,000
a ship named the Treasure sank off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa,

24
0:01:30.435,000 --> 0:01:32,000
spilling 1,300 tons of fuel,

25
0:01:32.847,000 --> 0:01:37,000
which polluted the habitats of nearly half the entire world population

26
0:01:38.307,000 --> 0:01:39,000
of African penguins.

27
0:01:40.344,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Now, the ship sank between Robben Island to the south,

28
0:01:43.477,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and Dassen Island to the north --

29
0:01:45.851,000 --> 0:01:47,000
two of the penguins' main breeding islands.

30
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And exactly six years and three days earlier,

31
0:01:52.304,000 --> 0:01:54,000
on June 20, 1994,

32
0:01:55.05,000 --> 0:01:57,000
a ship named the Apollo Sea sank near Dassen Island,

33
0:01:57.97,000 --> 0:02:,000
oiling 10,000 penguins, half of which died.

34
0:02:02.514,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Now when the Treasure sank in 2000,

35
0:02:04.335,000 --> 0:02:06,000
it was the height of the best breeding season

36
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
scientists had ever recorded for the African penguin,

37
0:02:11.178,000 --> 0:02:13,000
which at the time, was listed as a threatened species.

38
0:02:14.169,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And soon, nearly 20,000 penguins

39
0:02:16.927,000 --> 0:02:18,000
were covered with this toxic oil.

40
0:02:19.362,000 --> 0:02:22,000
The local seabird rescue center, named SANCCOB,

41
0:02:22.443,000 --> 0:02:25,000
immediately launched a massive rescue operation,

42
0:02:25.519,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken.

43
0:02:30.475,000 --> 0:02:32,000
At the time, I was working down the street.

44
0:02:32.562,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I was a penguin aquarist at the New England Aquarium.

45
0:02:35.388,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And exactly 11 years ago yesterday,

46
0:02:39.472,000 --> 0:02:41,000
the phone rang in the penguin office.

47
0:02:41.901,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And with that call, my life would change forever.

48
0:02:44.869,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It was Estelle van Der Merwe calling from SANCCOB,

49
0:02:47.493,000 --> 0:02:48,000
saying, "Please come help.

50
0:02:49.354,000 --> 0:02:51,000
We have thousands of oiled penguins

51
0:02:52.084,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and thousands of willing but completely inexperienced volunteers.

52
0:02:57.499,000 --> 0:03:,000
And we need penguin experts to come train and supervise them."

53
0:03:01.126,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So two days later,

54
0:03:02.634,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I was on a plane headed for Cape Town

55
0:03:04.629,000 --> 0:03:06,000
with a team of penguin specialists.

56
0:03:07.487,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And the scene inside of this building was devastating and surreal.

57
0:03:12.412,000 --> 0:03:15,000
In fact, many people compared it to a war zone.

58
0:03:15.833,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Last week, a 10-year-old girl asked me:

59
0:03:18.994,000 --> 0:03:21,000
"What did it feel like when you first walked into that building

60
0:03:22.794,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and saw so many oiled penguins?"

61
0:03:26.982,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And this is what happened.

62
0:03:28.376,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I was instantly transported back to that moment in time.

63
0:03:33.122,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Penguins are very vocal birds and really, really noisy,

64
0:03:37.114,000 --> 0:03:39,000
so I expected to walk into this building

65
0:03:39.635,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and be met with this cacophony of honking and braying and squawking.

66
0:03:43.611,000 --> 0:03:44,000
But instead,

67
0:03:45.089,000 --> 0:03:48,000
when we stepped through those doors and into the building,

68
0:03:48.895,000 --> 0:03:5,000
it was eerily silent.

69
0:03:52.566,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So it was very clear

70
0:03:54.043,000 --> 0:03:57,000
these were stressed, sick, traumatized birds.

71
0:03:58.068,000 --> 0:04:,000
The other thing that was so striking

72
0:04:00.431,000 --> 0:04:02,000
was the sheer number of volunteers.

73
0:04:03.383,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Up to 1,000 people a day came to the rescue center.

74
0:04:07.097,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Eventually, over the course of this rescue,

75
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
more than 12-and-a-half thousand volunteers

76
0:04:12.713,000 --> 0:04:14,000
came from all over the world to Cape Town,

77
0:04:15.056,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to help save these birds.

78
0:04:16.659,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And the amazing thing was that not one of them had to be there.

79
0:04:21.278,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Yet they were.

80
0:04:22.453,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity,

81
0:04:25.782,000 --> 0:04:28,000
this extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis

82
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
was profoundly moving and awe-inspiring.

83
0:04:32.782,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So the day after we arrived,

84
0:04:34.163,000 --> 0:04:36,000
two of us from the aquarium were put in charge of room two.

85
0:04:37.092,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Room two had more than 4,000 oiled penguins in it.

86
0:04:41.315,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Now, mind you --

87
0:04:42.49,000 --> 0:04:45,000
three days earlier, we had 60 penguins under our care,

88
0:04:45.807,000 --> 0:04:47,000
so we were definitely overwhelmed

89
0:04:48.144,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and just a bit terrified -- at least I was.

90
0:04:51.092,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Personally, I really didn't know

91
0:04:53.117,000 --> 0:04:57,000
if I was capable of handling such a monstrous task.

92
0:04:57.518,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And collectively,

93
0:04:58.851,000 --> 0:05:,000
we really didn't know if we could pull this off.

94
0:05:01.852,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Because we all knew that just six years earlier,

95
0:05:05.158,000 --> 0:05:08,000
half as many penguins had been oiled and rescued,

96
0:05:08.197,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and only half of them had survived.

97
0:05:11.149,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So would it be humanly possible to save this many oiled penguins?

98
0:05:15.389,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We just did not know.

99
0:05:17.741,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But what gave us hope

100
0:05:19.064,000 --> 0:05:22,000
were these incredibly dedicated and brave volunteers,

101
0:05:22.483,000 --> 0:05:24,000
three of whom here are force-feeding penguins.

102
0:05:25.35,000 --> 0:05:27,000
You may notice they're wearing very thick gloves.

103
0:05:27.898,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And what you should know about African penguins

104
0:05:30.413,000 --> 0:05:32,000
is that they have razor-sharp beaks.

105
0:05:33.365,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And before long,

106
0:05:34.563,000 --> 0:05:36,000
our bodies were covered head to toe

107
0:05:37.42,000 --> 0:05:4,000
with these nasty wounds inflicted by the terrified penguins.

108
0:05:41.41,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Now the day after we arrived, a new crisis began to unfold.

109
0:05:44.999,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The oil slick was now moving north towards Dassen Island,

110
0:05:48.226,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and the rescuers despaired,

111
0:05:50.519,000 --> 0:05:52,000
because they knew if the oil hit,

112
0:05:52.678,000 --> 0:05:54,000
it would not be possible to rescue any more oiled birds.

113
0:05:55.551,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And there really were no good solutions.

114
0:05:57.559,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But then finally,

115
0:05:58.734,000 --> 0:06:,000
one of the researchers threw out this crazy idea.

116
0:06:01.703,000 --> 0:06:04,000
He said, "OK, why don't we try and collect the birds

117
0:06:05.353,000 --> 0:06:06,000
at the greatest risk of getting oiled" --

118
0:06:07.352,000 --> 0:06:08,000
they collected 20,000 --

119
0:06:09.119,000 --> 0:06:13,000
"and we'll ship them 500 miles up the coast to Port Elizabeth

120
0:06:13.75,000 --> 0:06:14,000
in these open-air trucks,

121
0:06:15.077,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and release them into the clean waters there

122
0:06:17.284,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and let them swim back home?"

123
0:06:19.316,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Laughter)

124
0:06:23.405,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So three of those penguins -- Peter, Pamela and Percy --

125
0:06:26.747,000 --> 0:06:27,000
wore satellite tags,

126
0:06:27.922,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and the researchers crossed their fingers

127
0:06:29.925,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and hoped that by the time they got back home,

128
0:06:32.19,000 --> 0:06:34,000
the oil would be cleaned up from their islands.

129
0:06:34.439,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And luckily, the day they arrived, it was.

130
0:06:37.384,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So it had been a huge gamble, but it had paid off.

131
0:06:41.327,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And so they know now that they can use this strategy

132
0:06:44.261,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in future oil spills.

133
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So in wildlife rescue as in life,

134
0:06:49.638,000 --> 0:06:51,000
we learn from each previous experience,

135
0:06:51.804,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and we learn from both our successes and our failures.

136
0:06:56.034,000 --> 0:07:,000
And the main thing learned during the Apollo Sea rescue in '94

137
0:07:00.463,000 --> 0:07:04,000
was that most of those penguins had died due to the unwitting use

138
0:07:04.866,000 --> 0:07:07,000
of poorly ventilated transport boxes and trucks,

139
0:07:08.182,000 --> 0:07:09,000
because they just had not been prepared

140
0:07:10.108,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to deal with so many oiled penguins at once.

141
0:07:12.449,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So in these six years between these two oil spills,

142
0:07:15.387,000 --> 0:07:18,000
they've built thousands of these well-ventilated boxes.

143
0:07:18.744,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And as a result, during the Treasure rescue,

144
0:07:21.641,000 --> 0:07:25,000
just 160 penguins died during the transport process,

145
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
as opposed to 5,000.

146
0:07:28.261,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So this alone was a huge victory.

147
0:07:31.02,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Something else learned during the Apollo rescue

148
0:07:33.279,000 --> 0:07:34,000
was how to train the penguins

149
0:07:34.799,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to take fish freely from their hands,

150
0:07:37.8,000 --> 0:07:38,000
using these training boxes.

151
0:07:39.763,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And we used this technique again during the Treasure rescue.

152
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But an interesting thing was noted during the training process.

153
0:07:47.994,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The first penguins to make that transition to free feeding

154
0:07:51.476,000 --> 0:07:53,000
were the ones that had a metal band on their wing

155
0:07:54.44,000 --> 0:07:57,000
from the Apollo Sea spill six years earlier.

156
0:07:57.893,000 --> 0:08:,000
So penguins learn from previous experience, too.

157
0:08:02.162,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So all of those penguins had to have the oil meticulously cleaned

158
0:08:05.938,000 --> 0:08:06,000
from their bodies.

159
0:08:07.12,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It would take two people at least an hour just to clean one penguin.

160
0:08:11.947,000 --> 0:08:12,000
When you clean a penguin,

161
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
you first have to spray it with a degreaser.

162
0:08:15.49,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And this brings me to my favorite story from the Treasure rescue.

163
0:08:19.536,000 --> 0:08:21,000
About a year prior to this oil spill,

164
0:08:22.151,000 --> 0:08:25,000
a 17-year-old student had invented a degreaser.

165
0:08:25.929,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And they'd been using it at SANCCOB with great success,

166
0:08:28.77,000 --> 0:08:3,000
so they began using it during the Treasure rescue.

167
0:08:31.443,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But partway through, they ran out.

168
0:08:34.831,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So in a panic, Estelle from SANCCOB called the student

169
0:08:37.732,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and said, "Please, you have to make more!"

170
0:08:39.792,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So he raced to the lab

171
0:08:41.069,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and made enough to clean the rest of the birds.

172
0:08:44.171,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So I just think it is the coolest thing

173
0:08:46.979,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that a teenager invented a product

174
0:08:50.541,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that helped save the lives of thousands of animals.

175
0:08:54.557,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So what happened to those 20,000 oiled penguins?

176
0:08:58.089,000 --> 0:09:,000
And was Silvia Gaus right?

177
0:09:00.126,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Should we routinely euthanize all oiled birds

178
0:09:03.546,000 --> 0:09:05,000
because most of them are going to die anyway?

179
0:09:05.802,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Well, she could not be more wrong.

180
0:09:08.913,000 --> 0:09:12,000
After half a million hours of grueling volunteer labor,

181
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
more than 90 percent of those oiled penguins

182
0:09:15.667,000 --> 0:09:17,000
were successfully returned to the wild.

183
0:09:18.675,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And we know from follow-up studies

184
0:09:20.889,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that they have lived just as long as never-oiled penguins,

185
0:09:25.02,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and bred nearly as successfully.

186
0:09:27.742,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And in addition,

187
0:09:28.917,000 --> 0:09:31,000
about 3,000 penguin chicks were rescued and hand raised.

188
0:09:32.77,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And again, we know from long-term monitoring

189
0:09:35.463,000 --> 0:09:4,000
that more of these hand-raised chicks survive to adulthood and breeding age

190
0:09:41.375,000 --> 0:09:43,000
than do parent-raised chicks.

191
0:09:43.494,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Armed with this knowledge, SANCCOB has a chick-bolstering project,

192
0:09:46.974,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and every year, they rescue and raise abandoned chicks,

193
0:09:49.974,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and they have a very impressive, 80 percent success rate.

194
0:09:54.522,000 --> 0:09:55,000
This is critically important,

195
0:09:56.406,000 --> 0:09:58,000
because one year ago,

196
0:09:58.858,000 --> 0:10:,000
the African penguin was declared endangered.

197
0:10:02.208,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And they could be extinct in less than 10 years

198
0:10:06.038,000 --> 0:10:08,000
if we don't do something now to protect them.

199
0:10:08.943,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So what did I learn

200
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
from this intense and unforgettable experience?

201
0:10:13.464,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Personally, I learned that I am capable of handling so much more

202
0:10:17.052,000 --> 0:10:18,000
than I ever dreamed possible.

203
0:10:18.812,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And I learned that one person can make a huge difference.

204
0:10:22.745,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Just look at that 17-year-old.

205
0:10:24.777,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And when we come together and work as one,

206
0:10:28.428,000 --> 0:10:3,000
we can achieve extraordinary things.

207
0:10:31.226,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And truly, to be a part of something so much larger than yourself

208
0:10:35.226,000 --> 0:10:38,000
is the most rewarding experience you can possibly have.

209
0:10:39.863,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So I'd like to leave you with one final thought

210
0:10:42.275,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and a challenge, if you will.

211
0:10:43.872,000 --> 0:10:47,000
My mission as The Penguin Lady is to raise awareness and funding

212
0:10:48.087,000 --> 0:10:49,000
to protect penguins.

213
0:10:50.039,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But why should any of you care about penguins?

214
0:10:52.53,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Well, you should care because they're an indicator species.

215
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
And simply put: if penguins are dying, it means our oceans are dying.

216
0:11:01.165,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And we ultimately will be affected,

217
0:11:03.205,000 --> 0:11:05,000
because, as Sylvia Earle says,

218
0:11:05.37,000 --> 0:11:07,000
"The oceans are our life-support system."

219
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And the two main threats to penguins today

220
0:11:10.76,000 --> 0:11:12,000
are overfishing and global warming.

221
0:11:13.39,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And these are two things

222
0:11:14.574,000 --> 0:11:18,000
that each one of us actually has the power to do something about.

223
0:11:19.272,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So if we each do our part, together, we can make a difference,

224
0:11:23.453,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and we can help keep penguins from going extinct.

225
0:11:26.882,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Humans have always been the greatest threat to penguins,

226
0:11:30.332,000 --> 0:11:32,000
but we are now their only hope.

227
0:11:32.451,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Thank you.

228
0:11:33.626,000 --> 0:11:37,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.938,000 --> 0:00:15,000
You may have noticed that I'm wearing two different shoes.

2
0:00:18.72,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It probably looks funny --

3
0:00:20.414,000 --> 0:00:21,000
it definitely feels funny --

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
but I wanted to make a point.

5
0:00:24.571,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Let's say my left shoe corresponds to a sustainable footprint,

6
0:00:28.908,000 --> 0:00:31,000
meaning we humans consume less natural resources

7
0:00:32.13,000 --> 0:00:34,000
than our planet can regenerate,

8
0:00:34.378,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and emit less carbon dioxide than our forests and oceans can reabsorb.

9
0:00:39.532,000 --> 0:00:41,000
That's a stable and healthy condition.

10
0:00:42.374,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Today's situation is more like my other shoe.

11
0:00:45.666,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It's way oversized.

12
0:00:47.982,000 --> 0:00:5,000
At the second of August in 2017,

13
0:00:51.185,000 --> 0:00:55,000
we had already consumed all resources our planet can regenerate this year.

14
0:00:56.764,000 --> 0:00:59,000
This is like spending all your money until the 18th of a month

15
0:01:00.299,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and then needing a credit from the bank for the rest of the time.

16
0:01:03.601,000 --> 0:01:05,000
For sure, you can do this for some months in a row,

17
0:01:06.006,000 --> 0:01:07,000
but if you don't change your behavior,

18
0:01:07.926,000 --> 0:01:09,000
sooner or later, you will run into big problems.

19
0:01:11.219,000 --> 0:01:15,000
We all know the devastating effects of this excessive exploitation:

20
0:01:15.936,000 --> 0:01:16,000
global warming,

21
0:01:17.347,000 --> 0:01:18,000
rising of the sea levels,

22
0:01:19.109,000 --> 0:01:21,000
melting of the glaciers and polar ice,

23
0:01:21.44,000 --> 0:01:24,000
increasingly extreme climate patterns and more.

24
0:01:26.417,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The enormity of this problem really frustrates me.

25
0:01:30.306,000 --> 0:01:33,000
What frustrates me even more is that there are solutions to this,

26
0:01:33.673,000 --> 0:01:35,000
but we keep doing things like we always did.

27
0:01:36.599,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Today I want to share with you

28
0:01:38.387,000 --> 0:01:42,000
how a new solar technology can contribute to a sustainable future of buildings.

29
0:01:44.504,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Buildings consume about 40 percent of our total energy demand,

30
0:01:48.785,000 --> 0:01:49,000
so tackling this consumption

31
0:01:50.163,000 --> 0:01:52,000
would significantly reduce our climate emissions.

32
0:01:53.436,000 --> 0:01:55,000
A building designed along sustainable principles

33
0:01:55.779,000 --> 0:01:57,000
can produce all the power it needs by itself.

34
0:01:58.814,000 --> 0:01:59,000
To achieve this,

35
0:01:59.988,000 --> 0:02:02,000
you first have to reduce the consumption as much as possible,

36
0:02:03.37,000 --> 0:02:05,000
by using well-insulated walls or windows, for instance.

37
0:02:06.621,000 --> 0:02:08,000
These technologies are commercially available.

38
0:02:09.828,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Then you need energy for warm water and heating.

39
0:02:13.13,000 --> 0:02:15,000
You can get this in a renewable way from the sun

40
0:02:15.834,000 --> 0:02:16,000
through solar-thermal installations

41
0:02:17.672,000 --> 0:02:19,000
or from the ground and air, with heat pumps.

42
0:02:20.023,000 --> 0:02:21,000
All of these technologies are available.

43
0:02:22.972,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Then you are left with the need for electricity.

44
0:02:25.964,000 --> 0:02:28,000
In principle, there are several ways to get renewable electricity,

45
0:02:29.884,000 --> 0:02:32,000
but how many buildings do you know which have a windmill on the roof

46
0:02:33.178,000 --> 0:02:34,000
or a water power plant in the garden?

47
0:02:35.49,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Probably not so many, because usually, it doesn't make sense.

48
0:02:38.533,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But the sun provides abundant energy to our roofs and facades.

49
0:02:43.39,000 --> 0:02:47,000
The potential to harvest this energy at our buildings' surfaces is enormous.

50
0:02:48.699,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Let's take Europe as an example.

51
0:02:51.166,000 --> 0:02:55,000
If you would utilize all areas which have a nice orientation to the sun

52
0:02:55.484,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and they're not overly shaded,

53
0:02:57.191,000 --> 0:03:,000
the power generated by photovoltaics

54
0:03:00.25,000 --> 0:03:03,000
would correspond to about 30 percent of our total energy demand.

55
0:03:04.303,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But today's photovoltaics have some issues.

56
0:03:07.61,000 --> 0:03:09,000
They do offer a good cost-performance ratio,

57
0:03:10.204,000 --> 0:03:12,000
but they aren't really flexible in terms of their design,

58
0:03:12.896,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and this makes aesthetics a challenge.

59
0:03:15.123,000 --> 0:03:17,000
People often imagine pictures like this

60
0:03:17.599,000 --> 0:03:19,000
when thinking about solar cells on buildings.

61
0:03:20.056,000 --> 0:03:21,000
This may work for solar farms,

62
0:03:21.986,000 --> 0:03:24,000
but when you think of buildings, of streets, of architecture,

63
0:03:25.414,000 --> 0:03:26,000
aesthetics does matter.

64
0:03:27.52,000 --> 0:03:31,000
This is the reason why we don't see many solar cells on buildings today.

65
0:03:31.567,000 --> 0:03:32,000
They just don't match.

66
0:03:33.765,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Our team is working on a totally different solar-cell technology,

67
0:03:38.097,000 --> 0:03:41,000
which is called organic photovoltaics or OPV.

68
0:03:41.595,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The term organic describes

69
0:03:43.456,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that the material used for light absorption and charge transport

70
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
are mainly based on the element carbon,

71
0:03:49.448,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and not on metals.

72
0:03:51.339,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We utilize the mixture of a polymer

73
0:03:54.077,000 --> 0:03:56,000
which is set up by different repeating units,

74
0:03:56.66,000 --> 0:03:58,000
like the pearls in a pearl chain,

75
0:03:58.714,000 --> 0:04:,000
and a small molecule which has the shape of a football

76
0:04:01.714,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and is called fullerene.

77
0:04:03.85,000 --> 0:04:06,000
These two compounds are mixed and dissolved to become an ink.

78
0:04:08.413,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And like ink,

79
0:04:09.594,000 --> 0:04:13,000
they can be printed with simple printing techniques like slot-die coating

80
0:04:14.044,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in a continuous roll-to-roll process on flexible substrates.

81
0:04:18.855,000 --> 0:04:2,000
The resulting thin layer is the active layer,

82
0:04:21.244,000 --> 0:04:22,000
absorbing the energy of the sun.

83
0:04:23.905,000 --> 0:04:25,000
This active layer is extremely effective.

84
0:04:27.522,000 --> 0:04:3,000
You only need a layer thickness of 0.2 micrometers

85
0:04:30.951,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to absorb the energy of the sun.

86
0:04:33.169,000 --> 0:04:35,000
This is 100 times thinner than a human hair.

87
0:04:36.876,000 --> 0:04:37,000
To give you another example,

88
0:04:38.869,000 --> 0:04:4,000
take one kilogram of the basic polymer

89
0:04:41.59,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and use it to formulate the active ink.

90
0:04:44.502,000 --> 0:04:45,000
With this amount of ink,

91
0:04:45.935,000 --> 0:04:49,000
you can print a solar cell the size of a complete football field.

92
0:04:51.114,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So OPV is extremely material efficient,

93
0:04:54.822,000 --> 0:04:57,000
which I think is a crucial thing when talking about sustainability.

94
0:04:59.354,000 --> 0:05:,000
After the printing process,

95
0:05:01.259,000 --> 0:05:03,000
you can have a solar module which could look like this ...

96
0:05:04.988,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It looks a bit like a plastic foil

97
0:05:07.035,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and actually has many of its features.

98
0:05:09.625,000 --> 0:05:1,000
It's lightweight ...

99
0:05:12.478,000 --> 0:05:13,000
it's bendable ...

100
0:05:14.458,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and it's semi-transparent.

101
0:05:18.949,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But it can harvest the energy of the sun outdoors

102
0:05:21.353,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and also of this indoor light,

103
0:05:22.848,000 --> 0:05:24,000
as you can see with this small, illuminated LED.

104
0:05:26.872,000 --> 0:05:27,000
You can use it in its plastic form

105
0:05:28.804,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and take advantage of its low weight and its bendability.

106
0:05:32.938,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The first is important when thinking about buildings in warmer regions.

107
0:05:37.325,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Here, the roofs are not designed to bear additionally heavy loads.

108
0:05:40.981,000 --> 0:05:42,000
They aren't designed for snow in winter, for instance,

109
0:05:43.655,000 --> 0:05:47,000
so heavy silicon solar cells cannot be used for light harvesting,

110
0:05:47.847,000 --> 0:05:5,000
but these lightweight solar foils are very well suited.

111
0:05:52.067,000 --> 0:05:54,000
The bendability is important

112
0:05:54.545,000 --> 0:05:57,000
if you want to combine the solar cell with membrane architecture.

113
0:05:58.802,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Imagine the sails of the Sydney Opera as power plants.

114
0:06:02.932,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Alternatively, you can combine the solar foils

115
0:06:05.282,000 --> 0:06:07,000
with conventional construction materials like glass.

116
0:06:08.458,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Many glass facade elements contain a foil anyway,

117
0:06:10.873,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to create laminated safety glass.

118
0:06:13.148,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It's not a big deal to add a second foil in the production process,

119
0:06:16.691,000 --> 0:06:18,000
but then the facade element contains the solar cell

120
0:06:19.627,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and can produce electricity.

121
0:06:23.059,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Besides looking nice,

122
0:06:24.773,000 --> 0:06:28,000
these integrated solar cells come along with two more important benefits.

123
0:06:29.595,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Do you remember the solar cell attached to a roof I showed before?

124
0:06:33.322,000 --> 0:06:35,000
In this case, we install the roof first,

125
0:06:36.015,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and as a second layer, the solar cell.

126
0:06:37.931,000 --> 0:06:39,000
This is adding on the installation costs.

127
0:06:40.508,000 --> 0:06:42,000
In the case of integrated solar cells,

128
0:06:42.668,000 --> 0:06:45,000
at the site of construction, only one element is installed,

129
0:06:46.141,000 --> 0:06:48,000
being at the same time the envelope of the building

130
0:06:48.626,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and the solar cell.

131
0:06:50.799,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Besides saving on the installation costs,

132
0:06:52.853,000 --> 0:06:53,000
this also saves resources,

133
0:06:54.799,000 --> 0:06:57,000
because the two functions are combined into one element.

134
0:06:58.247,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Earlier, I've talked about optics.

135
0:07:00.168,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I really like this solar panel --

136
0:07:02.366,000 --> 0:07:04,000
maybe you have different taste or different design needs ...

137
0:07:06.167,000 --> 0:07:07,000
No problem.

138
0:07:07.342,000 --> 0:07:08,000
With the printing process,

139
0:07:08.63,000 --> 0:07:12,000
the solar cell can change its shape and design very easily.

140
0:07:13.574,000 --> 0:07:15,000
This will give the flexibility to architects,

141
0:07:16.112,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to planners and building owners,

142
0:07:18.048,000 --> 0:07:21,000
to integrate this electricity-producing technology as they wish.

143
0:07:27.322,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I want to stress that this is not just happening in the labs.

144
0:07:30.619,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It will take several more years to get to mass adoption,

145
0:07:33.391,000 --> 0:07:35,000
but we are at the edge of commercialization,

146
0:07:36.662,000 --> 0:07:39,000
meaning there are several companies out there with production lines.

147
0:07:40.561,000 --> 0:07:41,000
They are scaling up their capacities,

148
0:07:42.441,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and so are we, with the inks.

149
0:07:48.613,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Shoe drops)

150
0:07:53.004,000 --> 0:07:55,000
This smaller footprint is much more comfortable.

151
0:07:55.578,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Laughter)

152
0:07:57.07,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It is the right size, the right scale.

153
0:08:00.032,000 --> 0:08:03,000
We have to come back to the right scale when it comes to energy consumption.

154
0:08:04.535,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And making buildings carbon-neutral is an important part here.

155
0:08:08.331,000 --> 0:08:09,000
In Europe,

156
0:08:09.506,000 --> 0:08:12,000
we have the goal to decarbonize our building stock [by] 2050.

157
0:08:13.324,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I hope organic photovoltaics will be a big part of this.

158
0:08:17.882,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Here are a couple of examples.

159
0:08:20.123,000 --> 0:08:24,000
This is the first commercial installation of fully printed organic solar cells.

160
0:08:25.276,000 --> 0:08:28,000
"Commercial" means that the solar cells were printed on industrial equipment.

161
0:08:29.903,000 --> 0:08:32,000
The so-called "solar trees" were part of the German pavilion

162
0:08:33.313,000 --> 0:08:35,000
at the World Expo in Milan in 2015.

163
0:08:36.532,000 --> 0:08:38,000
They provided shading during the day

164
0:08:38.686,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and electricity for the lighting in the evening.

165
0:08:41.716,000 --> 0:08:44,000
You may wonder why this hexagonal shape was chosen for the solar cells.

166
0:08:45.744,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Easy answer:

167
0:08:46.98,000 --> 0:08:49,000
the architects wanted to have a specific shading pattern on the floor

168
0:08:50.338,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and asked for it,

169
0:08:51.628,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and then it was printed as requested.

170
0:08:54.276,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Being far from a real product,

171
0:08:55.951,000 --> 0:08:58,000
this free-form installation hooked the imagination of the visiting architects

172
0:08:59.713,000 --> 0:09:,000
much more than we expected.

173
0:09:01.83,000 --> 0:09:03,000
This other application is closer to the projects

174
0:09:04.796,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and applications we are targeting.

175
0:09:06.941,000 --> 0:09:08,000
In an office building in São Paulo, Brazil,

176
0:09:09.85,000 --> 0:09:12,000
semitransparent OPV panels are integrated into the glass facade,

177
0:09:13.619,000 --> 0:09:14,000
serving different needs.

178
0:09:15.55,000 --> 0:09:18,000
First, they provided shading for the meeting rooms behind.

179
0:09:19.479,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Second, the logo of the company is displayed in an innovative way.

180
0:09:24.644,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And of course, electricity is produced,

181
0:09:26.557,000 --> 0:09:28,000
reducing the energy footprint of the building.

182
0:09:29.552,000 --> 0:09:3,000
This is pointing towards a future

183
0:09:31.422,000 --> 0:09:33,000
where buildings are no longer energy consumers,

184
0:09:33.893,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but energy providers.

185
0:09:35.96,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I want to see solar cells seamlessly integrated

186
0:09:38.923,000 --> 0:09:39,000
into our building shells

187
0:09:40.826,000 --> 0:09:43,000
to be both resource-efficient and a pleasure to look at.

188
0:09:44.612,000 --> 0:09:48,000
For roofs, silicon solar cells will often continue to be a good solution.

189
0:09:49.112,000 --> 0:09:53,000
But to exploit the potential of all facades and other areas,

190
0:09:53.652,000 --> 0:09:55,000
such as semitransparent areas,

191
0:09:55.96,000 --> 0:09:57,000
curved surfaces and shadings,

192
0:09:58.572,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I believe organic photovoltaics can offer a significant contribution,

193
0:10:03.605,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and they can be made in any form architects and planners will want them to.

194
0:10:09.425,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Thank you.

195
0:10:10.6,000 --> 0:10:13,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.329,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The shocking police crackdown on protestors in Ferguson, Missouri,

2
0:00:17.717,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in the wake of the police shooting of Michael Brown,

3
0:00:20.729,000 --> 0:00:24,000
underscored the extent to which advanced military weapons and equipment,

4
0:00:24.952,000 --> 0:00:25,000
designed for the battlefield,

5
0:00:26.684,000 --> 0:00:27,000
are making their way

6
0:00:27.993,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to small-town police departments across the United States.

7
0:00:32.514,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Although much tougher to observe,

8
0:00:34.5,000 --> 0:00:37,000
this same thing is happening with surveillance equipment.

9
0:00:38.047,000 --> 0:00:4,000
NSA-style mass surveillance is enabling

10
0:00:40.707,000 --> 0:00:42,000
local police departments to gather vast quantities

11
0:00:43.665,000 --> 0:00:46,000
of sensitive information about each and every one of us

12
0:00:47.232,000 --> 0:00:51,000
in a way that was never previously possible.

13
0:00:51.284,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Location information can be very sensitive.

14
0:00:54.76,000 --> 0:00:56,000
If you drive your car around the United States,

15
0:00:57.391,000 --> 0:00:58,000
it can reveal if you go to a therapist,

16
0:00:59.314,000 --> 0:01:01,000
attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting,

17
0:01:01.782,000 --> 0:01:03,000
if you go to church or if you don't go to church.

18
0:01:04.603,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And when that information about you

19
0:01:06.329,000 --> 0:01:09,000
is combined with the same information about everyone else,

20
0:01:09.824,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the government can gain a detailed portrait

21
0:01:12.398,000 --> 0:01:14,000
of how private citizens interact.

22
0:01:15.114,000 --> 0:01:17,000
This information used to be private.

23
0:01:17.589,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Thanks to modern technology,

24
0:01:19.282,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the government knows far too much about what happens behind closed doors.

25
0:01:23.61,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And local police departments make decisions about who they think you are

26
0:01:27.998,000 --> 0:01:3,000
based on this information.

27
0:01:31.169,000 --> 0:01:35,000
One of the key technologies driving mass location tracking

28
0:01:35.816,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is the innocuous-sounding Automatic License Plate Reader.

29
0:01:38.774,000 --> 0:01:39,000
If you haven't seen one,

30
0:01:40.469,000 --> 0:01:43,000
it's probably because you didn't know what to look for --

31
0:01:43.657,000 --> 0:01:44,000
they're everywhere.

32
0:01:45.032,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Mounted on roads or on police cars,

33
0:01:48.104,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Automatic License Plate Readers capture images of every passing car

34
0:01:52.533,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and convert the license plate into machine-readable text

35
0:01:56.158,000 --> 0:01:59,000
so that they can be checked against hot lists

36
0:01:59.56,000 --> 0:02:02,000
of cars potentially wanted for wrongdoing.

37
0:02:02.845,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But more than that, increasingly,

38
0:02:04.972,000 --> 0:02:06,000
local police departments are keeping records

39
0:02:07.122,000 --> 0:02:1,000
not just of people wanted for wrongdoing,

40
0:02:10.282,000 --> 0:02:12,000
but of every plate that passes them by,

41
0:02:13.084,000 --> 0:02:16,000
resulting in the collection of mass quantities of data

42
0:02:17.053,000 --> 0:02:19,000
about where Americans have gone.

43
0:02:19.294,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Did you know this was happening?

44
0:02:21.822,000 --> 0:02:24,000
When Mike Katz-Lacabe asked his local police department

45
0:02:25.228,000 --> 0:02:28,000
for information about the plate reader data they had on him,

46
0:02:28.657,000 --> 0:02:29,000
this is what they got:

47
0:02:30.335,000 --> 0:02:33,000
in addition to the date, time and location,

48
0:02:33.477,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the police department had photographs that captured

49
0:02:36.508,000 --> 0:02:39,000
where he was going and often who he was with.

50
0:02:39.898,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The second photo from the top is a picture of Mike and his two daughters

51
0:02:43.72,000 --> 0:02:46,000
getting out of their car in their own driveway.

52
0:02:47.552,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The government has hundreds of photos like this

53
0:02:50.34,000 --> 0:02:52,000
about Mike going about his daily life.

54
0:02:53.111,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And if you drive a car in the United States,

55
0:02:55.295,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I would bet money that they have photographs

56
0:02:58.028,000 --> 0:03:,000
like this of you going about your daily life.

57
0:03:00.946,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Mike hasn't done anything wrong.

58
0:03:02.987,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Why is it okay that the government is keeping all of this information?

59
0:03:06.942,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The reason it's happening is because,

60
0:03:08.721,000 --> 0:03:11,000
as the cost of storing this data has plummeted,

61
0:03:12.072,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the police departments simply hang on to it,

62
0:03:14.584,000 --> 0:03:17,000
just in case it could be useful someday.

63
0:03:18.366,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The issue is not just that one police department

64
0:03:20.866,000 --> 0:03:22,000
is gathering this information in isolation

65
0:03:23.487,000 --> 0:03:25,000
or even that multiple police departments are doing it.

66
0:03:26.246,000 --> 0:03:28,000
At the same time, the federal government

67
0:03:28.743,000 --> 0:03:31,000
is collecting all of these individual pots of data,

68
0:03:32.361,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and pooling them together into one vast database

69
0:03:35.682,000 --> 0:03:36,000
with hundreds of millions of hits,

70
0:03:37.338,000 --> 0:03:39,000
showing where Americans have traveled.

71
0:03:39.806,000 --> 0:03:42,000
This document from the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration,

72
0:03:42.964,000 --> 0:03:44,000
which is one of the agencies primarily interested in this,

73
0:03:45.729,000 --> 0:03:49,000
is one of several that reveal the existence of this database.

74
0:03:50.166,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Meanwhile, in New York City,

75
0:03:52.735,000 --> 0:03:55,000
the NYPD has driven police cars equipped with license plate readers

76
0:03:56.677,000 --> 0:04:,000
past mosques in order to figure out who is attending.

77
0:04:00.851,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The uses and abuses of this technology aren't limited to the United States.

78
0:04:04.689,000 --> 0:04:07,000
In the U.K., the police department

79
0:04:07.724,000 --> 0:04:11,000
put 80-year-old John Kat on a plate reader watch list

80
0:04:11.868,000 --> 0:04:15,000
after he had attended dozens of lawful political demonstrations

81
0:04:16.145,000 --> 0:04:2,000
where he liked to sit on a bench and sketch the attendees.

82
0:04:20.771,000 --> 0:04:23,000
License plate readers aren't the only mass location tracking technology

83
0:04:24.293,000 --> 0:04:26,000
available to law enforcement agents today.

84
0:04:26.449,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Through a technique known as a cell tower dump,

85
0:04:29.461,000 --> 0:04:32,000
law enforcement agents can uncover who was using

86
0:04:32.713,000 --> 0:04:34,000
one or more cell towers at a particular time,

87
0:04:34.998,000 --> 0:04:36,000
a technique which has been known to reveal

88
0:04:37.03,000 --> 0:04:41,000
the location of tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands of people.

89
0:04:41.309,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Also, using a device known as a StingRay,

90
0:04:44.549,000 --> 0:04:46,000
law enforcement agents can send tracking signals

91
0:04:47.185,000 --> 0:04:51,000
inside people's houses to identify the cell phones located there.

92
0:04:51.55,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And if they don't know which house to target,

93
0:04:53.812,000 --> 0:04:55,000
they've been known to drive this technology

94
0:04:55.998,000 --> 0:04:58,000
around through whole neighborhoods.

95
0:04:59.424,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Just as the police in Ferguson possess high-tech military weapons and equipment,

96
0:05:04.06,000 --> 0:05:06,000
so too do police departments across the United States

97
0:05:07.042,000 --> 0:05:09,000
possess high-tech surveillance gear.

98
0:05:09.377,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Just because you don't see it,

99
0:05:11.408,000 --> 0:05:13,000
doesn't mean it's not there.

100
0:05:13.793,000 --> 0:05:15,000
The question is, what should we do about this?

101
0:05:16.344,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I think this poses a serious civil liberties threat.

102
0:05:19.654,000 --> 0:05:23,000
History has shown that once the police have massive quantities of data,

103
0:05:24.016,000 --> 0:05:26,000
tracking the movements of innocent people,

104
0:05:26.095,000 --> 0:05:3,000
it gets abused, maybe for blackmail, maybe for political advantage,

105
0:05:30.411,000 --> 0:05:32,000
or maybe for simple voyeurism.

106
0:05:32.67,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Fortunately, there are steps we can take.

107
0:05:35.012,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Local police departments can be governed by the city councils,

108
0:05:38.742,000 --> 0:05:4,000
which can pass laws requiring the police

109
0:05:41.664,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to dispose of the data about innocent people

110
0:05:44.586,000 --> 0:05:47,000
while allowing the legitimate uses of the technology to go forward.

111
0:05:47.748,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Thank you.

112
0:05:49.423,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Applause).

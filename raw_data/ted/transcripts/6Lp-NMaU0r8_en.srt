On March 14, this year,

3
0:00:18.678,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I posted this poster on Facebook.

4
0:00:21.558,000 --> 0:00:23,000
This is an image of me and my daughter

5
0:00:23.983,000 --> 0:00:25,000
holding the Israeli flag.

6
0:00:26.763,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I will try to explain to you about the context of why

7
0:00:29.802,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and when I posted.

8
0:00:32.408,000 --> 0:00:35,000
A few days ago, I was sitting waiting

9
0:00:35.529,000 --> 0:00:37,000
on the line at the grocery store,

10
0:00:37.833,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and the owner and one of the clients

11
0:00:41.119,000 --> 0:00:42,000
were talking to each other,

12
0:00:42.809,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and the owner was explaining to the client

13
0:00:44.867,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that we're going to get 10,000 missiles on Israel.

14
0:00:48.343,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And the client was saying, no, it's 10,000 a day.

15
0:00:53.056,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:55.717,000 --> 0:01:,000
("10,000 missiles") This is the context. This is where we are now in Israel.

17
0:01:00.718,000 --> 0:01:03,000
We have this war with Iran coming for 10 years now,

18
0:01:04.306,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and we have people, you know, afraid.

19
0:01:07.681,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It's like every year it's the last minute

20
0:01:11.244,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that we can do something about the war with Iran.

21
0:01:13.719,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It's like, if we don't act now, it's too late forever,

22
0:01:17.391,000 --> 0:01:19,000
for 10 years now.

23
0:01:19.643,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So at some point it became, you know, to me,

24
0:01:22.04,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I'm a graphic designer, so I made posters about it

25
0:01:25.09,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and I posted the one I just showed you before.

26
0:01:29.065,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Most of the time, I make posters, I post them on Facebook,

27
0:01:32.127,000 --> 0:01:33,000
my friends like it, don't like it,

28
0:01:33.784,000 --> 0:01:34,000
most of the time don't like it, don't share it,

29
0:01:35.515,000 --> 0:01:37,000
don't nothing,

30
0:01:37.738,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and it's another day.

31
0:01:39.731,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So I went to sleep, and that was it for me.

32
0:01:43.683,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And later on in the night, I woke up

33
0:01:46.599,000 --> 0:01:47,000
because I'm always waking up in the night,

34
0:01:48.432,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and I went by the computer and I see all these red dots,

35
0:01:51.007,000 --> 0:01:54,000
you know, on Facebook, which I've never seen before.

36
0:01:54.159,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Laughter)

37
0:01:55.242,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And I was like, "What's going on?"

38
0:01:57.579,000 --> 0:02:,000
So I come to the computer and I start looking on,

39
0:02:01.083,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and suddenly I see many people talking to me,

40
0:02:04.108,000 --> 0:02:06,000
most of them I don't know,

41
0:02:06.471,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and a few of them from Iran,

42
0:02:09.056,000 --> 0:02:12,000
which is -- What?

43
0:02:12.537,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Because you have to understand,

44
0:02:15.154,000 --> 0:02:18,000
in Israel we don't talk with people from Iran.

45
0:02:18.808,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We don't know people from Iran.

46
0:02:20.778,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It's like, on Facebook, you have friends only from --

47
0:02:25.143,000 --> 0:02:28,000
it's like your neighbors are your friends on Facebook.

48
0:02:28.597,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And now people from Iran are talking to me.

49
0:02:31.334,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So I start answering this girl, and she's telling me

50
0:02:34.843,000 --> 0:02:38,000
she saw the poster and she asked her family to come,

51
0:02:39.703,000 --> 0:02:4,000
because they don't have a computer, she asked her family

52
0:02:41.319,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to come to see the poster, and they're all sitting in the living room crying.

53
0:02:45.867,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So I'm like, whoa.

54
0:02:47.549,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I ask my wife to come, and I tell her, you have to see that.

55
0:02:50.967,000 --> 0:02:53,000
People are crying, and she came, she read the text,

56
0:02:54.016,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and she started to cry.

57
0:02:56.716,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And everybody's crying now. (Laughter)

58
0:02:59.354,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So I don't know what to do, so my first reflex,

59
0:03:02.154,000 --> 0:03:05,000
as a graphic designer, is, you know, to show everybody

60
0:03:05.468,000 --> 0:03:08,000
what I'd just seen, and people started to see them

61
0:03:09.166,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and to share them, and that's how it started.

62
0:03:11.766,000 --> 0:03:14,000
The day after, when really it became a lot of talking,

63
0:03:15.505,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I said to myself, and my wife said to me,

64
0:03:17.728,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I also want a poster,

65
0:03:18.994,000 --> 0:03:21,000
so this is her. (Laughter)

66
0:03:22.456,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Because it's working, put me in a poster now.

67
0:03:27.438,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But more seriously, I was like, okay, these ones work,

68
0:03:30.548,000 --> 0:03:33,000
but it's not just about me, it's about people from Israel

69
0:03:33.846,000 --> 0:03:33,000
who want to say something.

70
0:03:34.749,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So I'm going to shoot all the people I know, if they want,

71
0:03:37.586,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and I'm going to put them in a poster and I'm going to share them.

72
0:03:39.674,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So I went to my neighbors and friends and students

73
0:03:43.356,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and I just asked them, give me a picture, I will make you a poster.

74
0:03:47.447,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And that's how it started. And that's how, really,

75
0:03:50.344,000 --> 0:03:53,000
it's unleashed, because suddenly people

76
0:03:53.757,000 --> 0:03:55,000
from Facebook, friends and others,

77
0:03:56.207,000 --> 0:03:58,000
just understand that they can be part of it.

78
0:03:59.164,000 --> 0:04:,000
It's not just one dude making one poster,

79
0:04:00.898,000 --> 0:04:03,000
it's -- we can be part of it, so they start sending me pictures

80
0:04:04.411,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and ask me, "Make me a poster. Post it.

81
0:04:06.787,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too."

82
0:04:11.421,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It became, you know, at some point it was really, really intense.

83
0:04:14.789,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I mean, so many pictures, so I asked friends

84
0:04:19.104,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to come, graphic designers most of them,

85
0:04:22.227,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to make posters with me, because I didn't have the time.

86
0:04:24.83,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It was a huge amount of pictures.

87
0:04:27.486,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So for a few days, that's how my living room was.

88
0:04:30.881,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And we received Israeli posters, Israeli images,

89
0:04:35.404,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but also lots of comments, lots of messages from Iran.

90
0:04:40.09,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And we took these messages and we made posters out of it,

91
0:04:43.772,000 --> 0:04:46,000
because I know people: They don't read, they see images.

92
0:04:47.237,000 --> 0:04:49,000
If it's an image, they may read it.

93
0:04:50.213,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So here are a few of them.

94
0:04:52.93,000 --> 0:04:54,000
("You are my first Israelian friend. I wish we both get rid of our idiot politicians, anyway nice to see you!")

95
0:04:55.203,000 --> 0:04:58,000
("I love that blue. I love that star. I love that flag.") This one is really moving for me because it's the story

96
0:04:58.739,000 --> 0:05:01,000
of a girl who has been raised in Iran

97
0:05:02.553,000 --> 0:05:07,000
to walk on an Israeli flag to enter her school every morning,

98
0:05:07.831,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and now that she sees the posters that we're sending,

99
0:05:11.162,000 --> 0:05:13,000
she starts -- she said that she changed her mind,

100
0:05:13.837,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and now she loves that blue, she loves that star,

101
0:05:17.178,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and she loves that flag, talking about the Israeli flag,

102
0:05:19.513,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and she wished that we'd meet and come to visit one another,

103
0:05:23.333,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and just a few days after I posted the first poster.

104
0:05:28.416,000 --> 0:05:3,000
The day after,

105
0:05:31.028,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Iranians started to respond with their own posters.

106
0:05:33.745,000 --> 0:05:36,000
They have graphic designers. What? (Laughter)

107
0:05:37.171,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Crazy, crazy.

108
0:05:39.513,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So you can see they are still shy, they don't want to show their faces,

109
0:05:43.038,000 --> 0:05:44,000
but they want to spread the message.

110
0:05:44.61,000 --> 0:05:46,000
They want to respond. They want to say the same thing.

111
0:05:46.746,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So. And now it's communication.

112
0:05:49.851,000 --> 0:05:52,000
It's a two-way story. It's Israelis and Iranians

113
0:05:53.277,000 --> 0:05:55,000
sending the same message, one to each other.

114
0:05:55.933,000 --> 0:05:56,000
("My Israeli Friends. I don't hate you. I don't want War.")

115
0:05:57.611,000 --> 0:06:01,000
This never happened before, and this is two people

116
0:06:01.771,000 --> 0:06:03,000
supposed to be enemies, we're on the verge of a war,

117
0:06:04.688,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and suddenly people on Facebook are starting to say,

118
0:06:07.307,000 --> 0:06:11,000
"I like this guy. I love those guys."

119
0:06:11.458,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And it became really big at some point.

120
0:06:15.896,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And then it became news.

121
0:06:19.208,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Because when you're seeing the Middle East, you see only the bad news.

122
0:06:23.408,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And suddenly, there is something that was happening

123
0:06:25.707,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that was good news. So the guys on the news,

124
0:06:28.533,000 --> 0:06:29,000
they say, "Okay, let's talk about this."

125
0:06:30.221,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And they just came, and it was so much,

126
0:06:33.42,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I remember one day, Michal,

127
0:06:35.859,000 --> 0:06:37,000
she was talking with the journalist, and she was asking him,

128
0:06:38.659,000 --> 0:06:42,000
"Who's gonna see the show?"And he said, "Everybody."

129
0:06:42.717,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So she said, "Everybody in Palestine, in where? Israel?

130
0:06:48.214,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Who is everybody?""Everybody."

131
0:06:51.13,000 --> 0:06:52,000
They said, "Syria?" "Syria."

132
0:06:52.744,000 --> 0:06:53,000
"Lebanon?""Lebanon."

133
0:06:54.484,000 --> 0:06:57,000
At some point, he just said, "40 million people are going to see you today.

134
0:06:58.455,000 --> 0:07:,000
It's everybody." The Chinese.

135
0:07:01.167,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And we were just at the beginning of the story.

136
0:07:06.793,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Something crazy also happened.

137
0:07:08.875,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Every time a country started talking about it,

138
0:07:12.063,000 --> 0:07:15,000
like Germany, America, wherever,

139
0:07:15.332,000 --> 0:07:2,000
a page on Facebook popped up with the same logo

140
0:07:20.76,000 --> 0:07:21,000
with the same stories, so at the beginning

141
0:07:22.517,000 --> 0:07:25,000
we had "Iran-Loves-Israel," which is an Iranian

142
0:07:26.332,000 --> 0:07:31,000
sitting in Tehran, saying, "Okay, Israel loves Iran?

143
0:07:31.41,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I give you Iran-Loves-Israel."

144
0:07:33.32,000 --> 0:07:34,000
You have Palestine-Loves-Israel.

145
0:07:34.922,000 --> 0:07:36,000
You have Lebanon that just -- a few days ago.

146
0:07:37.55,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And this whole list of pages on Facebook

147
0:07:41.018,000 --> 0:07:43,000
dedicated to the same message,

148
0:07:43.118,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to people sending their love, one to each other.

149
0:07:48.955,000 --> 0:07:51,000
The moment I really understood that something was happening,

150
0:07:52.651,000 --> 0:07:54,000
a friend of mine told me,

151
0:07:55.101,000 --> 0:07:57,000
"Google the word 'Israel.'"

152
0:07:57.103,000 --> 0:08:,000
And those were the first images on those days

153
0:08:00.81,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that popped up from Google

154
0:08:03.089,000 --> 0:08:06,000
when you were typing, "Israel" or "Iran."

155
0:08:06.695,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We really changed how people see the Middle East.

156
0:08:11.009,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Because you're not in the Middle East.

157
0:08:12.778,000 --> 0:08:14,000
You're somewhere over there, and then you want to see the Middle East,

158
0:08:15.069,000 --> 0:08:16,000
so you go on Google and you say, "Israel,"

159
0:08:16.725,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and they give you the bad stuff.

160
0:08:17.934,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And for a few days you got those images.

161
0:08:22.703,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Today the Israel-Loves-Iran page

162
0:08:25.102,000 --> 0:08:3,000
is this number, 80,831, and two million people last week

163
0:08:30.49,000 --> 0:08:32,000
went on the page and shared, liked, I don't know,

164
0:08:33.353,000 --> 0:08:35,000
commented on one of the photos.

165
0:08:35.945,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So for five months now, that's what we are doing,

166
0:08:40.453,000 --> 0:08:44,000
me, Michal, a few of my friends, are just making images.

167
0:08:45.203,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We're showing a new reality

168
0:08:47.49,000 --> 0:08:49,000
by just making images

169
0:08:49.693,000 --> 0:08:51,000
because that's how the world perceives us.

170
0:08:52.59,000 --> 0:08:54,000
They see images of us, and they see bad images.

171
0:08:55.391,000 --> 0:09:,000
So we're working on making good images. End of story.

172
0:09:00.442,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Look at this one. This is the Iran-Loves-Israel page.

173
0:09:05.357,000 --> 0:09:07,000
This is not the Israel-Loves-Iran. This is not my page.

174
0:09:07.875,000 --> 0:09:1,000
This is a guy in Tehran on the day of remembrance

175
0:09:11.654,000 --> 0:09:13,000
of the Israeli fallen soldier

176
0:09:14.196,000 --> 0:09:17,000
putting an image of an Israeli soldier on his page.

177
0:09:18.159,000 --> 0:09:21,000
This is the enemy.

178
0:09:21.55,000 --> 0:09:22,000
What?

179
0:09:23.022,000 --> 0:09:25,000
("Our heartfelt condolences to the families who lost their dearests in terror attack in Bulgaria")

180
0:09:25.064,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And it's going both ways.

181
0:09:26.769,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It's like, we are showing respect, one to each other.

182
0:09:31.307,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And we're understanding. And you show compassion.

183
0:09:36.293,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And you become friends.

184
0:09:41.054,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And at some point, you become friends on Facebook,

185
0:09:44.281,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and you become friends in life.

186
0:09:46.058,000 --> 0:09:48,000
You can go and travel and meet people.

187
0:09:48.874,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And I was in Munich a few weeks ago.

188
0:09:52.252,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I went there to open an exposition about Iran

189
0:09:56.079,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and I met there with people from the page

190
0:09:58.536,000 --> 0:10:,000
that told me, "Okay, you're going to be in Europe,

191
0:10:00.842,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I'm coming. I'm coming from France, from Holland,

192
0:10:03.446,000 --> 0:10:05,000
from Germany," of course, and from Israel people came,

193
0:10:06.167,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and we just met there for the first time in real life.

194
0:10:10.742,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I met with people that are supposed to be my enemies

195
0:10:15.259,000 --> 0:10:17,000
for the first time. And we just shake hands,

196
0:10:17.873,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and have a coffee and a nice discussion,

197
0:10:19.876,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and we talk about food and basketball.

198
0:10:22.596,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And that was the end of it.

199
0:10:24.334,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Remember that image from the beginning?

200
0:10:27.088,000 --> 0:10:35,000
At some point we met in real life, and we became friends.

201
0:10:35.469,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And it goes the other way around.

202
0:10:38.133,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Some girl that we met on Facebook

203
0:10:40.926,000 --> 0:10:42,000
never been in Israel, born and raised in Iran,

204
0:10:43.836,000 --> 0:10:46,000
lives in Germany, afraid of Israelis

205
0:10:47.394,000 --> 0:10:49,000
because of what she knows about us,

206
0:10:49.624,000 --> 0:10:52,000
decides after a few months of talking on the Internet

207
0:10:53.238,000 --> 0:10:56,000
with some Israelis to come to Israel,

208
0:10:56.282,000 --> 0:11:,000
and she gets on the plane and arrives at Ben Gurion

209
0:11:00.779,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and says, "Okay, not that big a deal."

210
0:11:06.906,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So a few weeks ago, the stress is getting higher,

211
0:11:10.493,000 --> 0:11:12,000
so we start this new campaign

212
0:11:12.966,000 --> 0:11:15,000
called "Not ready to die in your war."

213
0:11:16.338,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I mean, it's plus/minus the same message,

214
0:11:19.151,000 --> 0:11:22,000
but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it.

215
0:11:22.825,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And again, something amazing happened,

216
0:11:25.776,000 --> 0:11:28,000
something that we didn't have on the first wave of the campaign.

217
0:11:29.114,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Now people from Iran, the same ones who were shy

218
0:11:33.384,000 --> 0:11:35,000
at the first campaign and just sent, you know,

219
0:11:35.489,000 --> 0:11:37,000
their foot and half their faces,

220
0:11:37.677,000 --> 0:11:39,000
now they're sending their faces, and they're saying,

221
0:11:40.077,000 --> 0:11:49,000
"Okay, no problem, we're into it. We are with you."

222
0:11:49.142,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Just read where those guys are from.

223
0:11:52.662,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And for every guy from Israel,

224
0:11:54.977,000 --> 0:11:57,000
you've got someone from Iran.

225
0:12:06.344,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Just people sending their pictures.

226
0:12:26.391,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Crazy, yes?

227
0:12:28.574,000 --> 0:12:29,000
So --

228
0:12:30.21,000 --> 0:12:38,000
(Applause)

229
0:12:39.467,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So you may ask yourself, who is this dude?

230
0:12:46.864,000 --> 0:12:49,000
My name is Ronny Edry, and I'm 41, I'm an Israeli,

231
0:12:50.518,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I'm a father of two, I'm a husband,

232
0:12:54.798,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and I'm a graphic designer. I'm teaching graphic design.

233
0:12:59.778,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And I'm not that naive, because a lot of the time

234
0:13:03.546,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I've been asked, many times I've been asked, "Yeah, but,

235
0:13:06.929,000 --> 0:13:09,000
this is really naive, sending flowers over, I mean — "

236
0:13:10.155,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I was in the army. I was in the paratroopers for three years,

237
0:13:14.206,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and I know how it looks from the ground.

238
0:13:17.756,000 --> 0:13:21,000
I know how it can look really bad.

239
0:13:22.082,000 --> 0:13:26,000
So to me, this is the courageous thing to do,

240
0:13:26.219,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to try to reach the other side before it's too late,

241
0:13:29.658,000 --> 0:13:3,000
because when it's going to be too late, it's going to be too late.

242
0:13:31.573,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And sometimes war is inevitable, sometimes,

243
0:13:35.994,000 --> 0:13:39,000
but maybe [with] effort, we can avoid it.

244
0:13:40.064,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Maybe as people, because especially in Israel,

245
0:13:43.419,000 --> 0:13:46,000
we're in a democracy. We have the freedom of speech,

246
0:13:46.832,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and maybe that little thing can change something.

247
0:13:50.275,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And really, we can be our own ambassadors.

248
0:13:54.62,000 --> 0:14:,000
We can just send a message and hope for the best.

249
0:14:01.356,000 --> 0:14:03,000
So I want to ask Michal, my wife, to come with me

250
0:14:03.698,000 --> 0:14:07,000
on the stage just to make with you one image,

251
0:14:08.478,000 --> 0:14:1,000
because it's all about images.

252
0:14:10.603,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And maybe that image will help us change something.

253
0:14:15.174,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Just raise that. Exactly.

254
0:14:18.681,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And I'm just going to take a picture of it,

255
0:14:21.182,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and I'm just going to post it on Facebook

256
0:14:23.984,000 --> 0:14:28,000
with kind of "Israelis for peace" or something.

257
0:14:31.9,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Oh my God.

258
0:14:34.41,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Don't cry.

259
0:14:36.772,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Thank you guys.

260
0:14:38.463,000 --> 0:14:5,000
(Applause)

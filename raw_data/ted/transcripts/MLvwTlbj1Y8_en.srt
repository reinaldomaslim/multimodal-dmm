1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So today, I would like to talk with you

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
about bionics,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
which is the popular term

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
for the science of replacing part of a living organism

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
with a mechatronic device, or a robot.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It is essentially

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
the stuff of life meets machine.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And specifically, I'd like to talk with you

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
about how bionics is evolving

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
for people with arm amputations.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
This is our motivation.

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Arm amputation causes a huge disability.

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I mean, the functional impairment is clear.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Our hands are amazing instruments.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And when you lose one, far less both,

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
it's a lot harder to do the things

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
we physically need to do.

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
There's also a huge emotional impact.

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And actually, I spend as much of my time in clinic

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
dealing with the emotional adjustment of patients

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
as with the physical disability.

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And finally, there's a profound social impact.

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
We talk with our hands.

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
We greet with our hands.

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And we interact with the physical world with our hands.

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And when they're missing,

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
it's a barrier.

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Arm amputation is usually caused by trauma,

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
with things like industrial accidents,

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
motor vehicle collisions

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
or, very poignantly, war.

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
There are also some children who are born without arms,

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
called congenital limb deficiency.

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Unfortunately, we don't do great

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
with upper-limb prosthetics.

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
There are two general types.

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
They're called body-powered prostheses,

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
which were invented just after the Civil War,

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
refined in World War I and World War II.

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Here you see a patent

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
for an arm in 1912.

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It's not a lot different

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
than the one you see on my patient.

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
They work by harnessing shoulder power.

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So when you squish your shoulders, they pull on a bicycle cable.

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And that bicycle cable can open or close a hand or a hook

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
or bend an elbow.

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And we still use them commonly,

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
because they're very robust

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and relatively simple devices.

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The state of the art

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
is what we call myoelectric prostheses.

53
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
These are motorized devices

54
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that are controlled

55
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
by little electrical signals from your muscle.

56
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Every time you contract a muscle,

57
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
it emits a little electricity

58
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that you can record with antennae or electrodes

59
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and use that to operate the motorized prosthesis.

60
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
They work pretty well

61
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
for people who have just lost their hand,

62
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
because your hand muscles are still there.

63
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
You squeeze your hand, these muscles contract.

64
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
You open it, these muscles contract.

65
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So it's intuitive, and it works pretty well.

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Well how about with higher levels of amputation?

67
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Now you've lost your arm above the elbow.

68
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
You're missing not only these muscles,

69
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but your hand and your elbow too.

70
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
What do you do?

71
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Well our patients have to use

72
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
very code-y systems

73
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
of using just their arm muscles

74
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to operate robotic limbs.

75
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
We have robotic limbs.

76
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
There are several available on the market, and here you see a few.

77
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
They contain just a hand that will open and close,

78
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
a wrist rotator and an elbow.

79
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
There's no other functions.

80
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
If they did, how would we tell them what to do?

81
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
We built our own arm at the Rehab Institute of Chicago

82
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
where we've added some wrist flexion and shoulder joints

83
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to get up to six motors, or six degrees of freedom.

84
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And we've had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms

85
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that were funded by the U.S. military, using these prototypes,

86
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that had up to 10 different degrees of freedom

87
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
including movable hands.

88
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But at the end of the day,

89
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
how do we tell these robotic arms what to do?

90
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
How do we control them?

91
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Well we need a neural interface,

92
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
a way to connect to our nervous system

93
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
or our thought processes

94
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
so that it's intuitive, it's natural,

95
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
like for you and I.

96
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Well the body works by starting a motor command in your brain,

97
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
going down your spinal cord,

98
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
out the nerves and to your periphery.

99
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And your sensation's the exact opposite.

100
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
You touch yourself, there's a stimulus

101
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that comes up those very same nerves back up to your brain.

102
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
When you lose your arm, that nervous system still works.

103
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Those nerves can put out command signals.

104
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And if I tap the nerve ending

105
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
on a World War II vet,

106
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
he'll still feel his missing hand.

107
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So you might say,

108
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
let's go to the brain

109
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and put something in the brain to record signals,

110
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
or in the end of the peripheral nerve and record them there.

111
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And these are very exciting research areas,

112
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
but it's really, really hard.

113
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
You have to put in

114
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
hundreds of microscopic wires

115
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to record from little tiny individual neurons -- ordinary fibers

116
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that put out tiny signals

117
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that are microvolts.

118
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And it's just too hard

119
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to use now and for my patients today.

120
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So we developed a different approach.

121
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We're using a biological amplifier

122
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to amplify these nerve signals -- muscles.

123
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Muscles will amplify the nerve signals

124
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
about a thousand-fold,

125
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
so that we can record them from on top of the skin,

126
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
like you saw earlier.

127
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation.

128
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Imagine, with somebody who's lost their whole arm,

129
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
we still have four major nerves

130
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that go down your arm.

131
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And we take the nerve away from your chest muscle

132
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and let these nerves grow into it.

133
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Now you think, "Close hand," and a little section of your chest contracts.

134
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
You think, "Bend elbow,"

135
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
a different section contracts.

136
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And we can use electrodes or antennae

137
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
to pick that up and tell the arm to move.

138
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
That's the idea.

139
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So this is the first man that we tried it on.

140
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
His name is Jesse Sullivan.

141
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
He's just a saint of a man --

142
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
54-year-old lineman who touched the wrong wire

143
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and had both of his arms burnt so badly

144
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
they had to be amputated at the shoulder.

145
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
Jesse came to us at the RIC

146
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to be fit with these state-of-the-art devices, and here you see them.

147
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I'm still using that old technology

148
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
with a bicycle cable on his right side.

149
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And he picks which joint he wants to move with those chin switches.

150
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
On the left side he's got a modern motorized prosthesis

151
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
with those three joints,

152
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and he operates little pads in his shoulder

153
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that he touches to make the arm go.

154
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And Jesse's a good crane operator,

155
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and he did okay by our standards.

156
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
He also required a revision surgery on his chest.

157
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And that gave us the opportunity

158
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
to do targeted reinnervation.

159
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So my colleague, Dr. Greg Dumanian, did the surgery.

160
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
First, we cut away the nerve to his own muscle,

161
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
then we took the arm nerves

162
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and just kind of had them shift down onto his chest

163
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and closed him up.

164
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And after about three months,

165
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
the nerves grew in a little bit and we could get a twitch.

166
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And after six months, the nerves grew in well,

167
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and you could see strong contractions.

168
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And this is what it looks like.

169
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
This is what happens when Jesse thinks

170
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
open and close his hand,

171
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
or bend or straighten your elbow.

172
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
You can see the movements on his chest,

173
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and those little hash marks

174
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
are where we put our antennae, or electrodes.

175
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And I challenge anybody in the room

176
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to make their chest go like this.

177
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
His brain is thinking about his arm.

178
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
He has not learned how to do this with the chest.

179
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
There is not a learning process.

180
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
That's why it's intuitive.

181
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So here's Jesse in our first little test with him.

182
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
On the left-hand side, you see his original prosthesis,

183
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and he's using those switches

184
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to move little blocks from one box to the other.

185
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
He's had that arm for about 20 months, so he's pretty good with it.

186
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
On the right side,

187
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
two months after we fit him with his targeted reinnervation prosthesis --

188
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
which, by the way, is the same physical arm,

189
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
just programmed a little different --

190
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
you can see that he's much faster

191
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and much smoother as he moves these little blocks.

192
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And we're only able to use three of the signals at this time.

193
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Then we had one of those little surprises in science.

194
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So we're all motivated to get motor commands

195
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
to drive robotic arms.

196
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And after a few months,

197
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
you touch Jesse on his chest,

198
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and he felt his missing hand.

199
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
His hand sensation grew into his chest again

200
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
probably because we had also taken away a lot of fat,

201
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
so the skin was right down to the muscle

202
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and deinnervated, if you would, his skin.

203
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So you touch Jesse here, he feels his thumb;

204
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
you touch it here, he feels his pinky.

205
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
He feels light touch

206
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
down to one gram of force.

207
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
He feels hot, cold, sharp, dull,

208
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
all in his missing hand,

209
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
or both his hand and his chest,

210
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
but he can attend to either.

211
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So this is really exciting for us,

212
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
because now we have a portal,

213
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
a portal, or a way to potentially give back sensation,

214
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
so that he might feel what he touches

215
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
with his prosthetic hand.

216
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Imagine sensors in the hand

217
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
coming up and pressing on this new hand skin.

218
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So it was very exciting.

219
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
We've also gone on

220
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
with what was initially our primary population

221
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
of people with above-the-elbow amputations.

222
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And here we deinnervate, or cut the nerve away,

223
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
just from little segments of muscle

224
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and leave others alone

225
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that give us our up-down signals

226
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and two others that will give us a hand open and close signal.

227
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
This was one of our first patients, Chris.

228
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
You see him with his original device

229
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
on the left there after eight months of use,

230
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and on the right, it is two months.

231
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
He's about four or five times as fast

232
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
with this simple little performance metric.

233
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
All right.

234
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So one of the best parts of my job

235
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
is working with really great patients

236
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
who are also our research collaborators.

237
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And we're fortunate today

238
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
to have Amanda Kitts come and join us.

239
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Please welcome Amanda Kitts.

240
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
(Applause)

241
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So Amanda, would you please tell us how you lost your arm?

242
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Amanda Kitts: Sure. In 2006, I had a car accident.

243
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And I was driving home from work,

244
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and a truck was coming the opposite direction,

245
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
came over into my lane,

246
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
ran over the top of my car and his axle tore my arm off.

247
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Todd Kuiken: Okay, so after your amputation, you healed up.

248
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And you've got one of these conventional arms.

249
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Can you tell us how it worked?

250
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
AK: Well, it was a little difficult,

251
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
because all I had to work with was a bicep and a tricep.

252
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So for the simple little things like picking something up,

253
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I would have to bend my elbow,

254
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and then I would have to cocontract

255
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
to get it to change modes.

256
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
When I did that,

257
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I had to use my bicep

258
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to get the hand to close,

259
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
use my tricep to get it to open,

260
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
cocontract again

261
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
to get the elbow to work again.

262
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
TK: So it was a little slow?

263
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
AK: A little slow, and it was just hard to work.

264
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
You had to concentrate a whole lot.

265
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
TK: Okay, so I think about nine months later

266
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that you had the targeted reinnervation surgery,

267
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
took six more months to have all the reinnervation.

268
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Then we fit her with a prosthesis.

269
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And how did that work for you?

270
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
AK: It works good.

271
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
I was able to use my elbow

272
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and my hand simultaneously.

273
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I could work them just by my thoughts.

274
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So I didn't have to do any of the cocontracting and all that.

275
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
TK: A little faster?

276
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
AK: A little faster. And much more easy, much more natural.

277
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
TK: Okay, this was my goal.

278
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
For 20 years, my goal was to let somebody

279
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
[be] able to use their elbow and hand in an intuitive way

280
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and at the same time.

281
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And we now have over 50 patients around the world who have had this surgery,

282
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
including over a dozen of our wounded warriors

283
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
in the U.S. armed services.

284
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
The success rate of the nerve transfers is very high.

285
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
It's like 96 percent.

286
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Because we're putting a big fat nerve onto a little piece of muscle.

287
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And it provides intuitive control.

288
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Our functional testing, those little tests,

289
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
all show that they're a lot quicker and a lot easier.

290
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And the most important thing

291
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
is our patients have appreciated it.

292
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
So that was all very exciting.

293
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
But we want to do better.

294
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
There's a lot of information in those nerve signals,

295
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and we wanted to get more.

296
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
You can move each finger. You can move your thumb, your wrist.

297
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Can we get more out of it?

298
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So we did some experiments

299
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
where we saturated our poor patients with zillions of electrodes

300
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and then had them try to do two dozen different tasks --

301
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
from wiggling a finger to moving a whole arm

302
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to reaching for something --

303
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and recorded this data.

304
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And then we used some algorithms

305
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
that are a lot like speech recognition algorithms,

306
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
called pattern recognition.

307
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
See.

308
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
(Laughter)

309
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And here you can see, on Jesse's chest,

310
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
when he just tried to do three different things,

311
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
you can see three different patterns.

312
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
But I can't put in an electrode

313
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and say, "Go there."

314
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So we collaborated with our colleagues in University of New Brunswick,

315
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
came up with this algorithm control,

316
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
which Amanda can now demonstrate.

317
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
AK: So I have the elbow that goes up and down.

318
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I have the wrist rotation

319
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
that goes -- and it can go all the way around.

320
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And I have the wrist flexion and extension.

321
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And I also have the hand closed and open.

322
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
TK: Thank you, Amanda.

323
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Now this is a research arm,

324
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
but it's made out of commercial components from here down

325
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and a few that I've borrowed from around the world.

326
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
It's about seven pounds,

327
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
which is probably about what my arm would weigh

328
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
if I lost it right here.

329
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Obviously, that's heavy for Amanda.

330
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And in fact, it feels even heavier,

331
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
because it's not glued on the same.

332
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
She's carrying all the weight through harnesses.

333
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
So the exciting part isn't so much the mechatronics,

334
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
but the control.

335
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
So we've developed a small microcomputer

336
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
that is blinking somewhere behind her back

337
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and is operating this

338
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
all by the way she trains it

339
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
to use her individual muscle signals.

340
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
So Amanda, when you first started using this arm,

341
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
how long did it take to use it?

342
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
AK: It took just about probably three to four hours

343
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
to get it to train.

344
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
I had to hook it up to a computer,

345
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
so I couldn't just train it anywhere.

346
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
So if it stopped working, I just had to take it off.

347
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
So now it's able to train

348
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
with just this little piece on the back.

349
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
I can wear it around.

350
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
If it stops working for some reason, I can retrain it.

351
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Takes about a minute.

352
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
TK: So we're really excited,

353
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
because now we're getting to a clinically practical device.

354
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And that's where our goal is --

355
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
to have something clinically pragmatic to wear.

356
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We've also had Amanda able to use

357
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
some of our more advanced arms that I showed you earlier.

358
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Here's Amanda using an arm made by DEKA Research Corporation.

359
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And I believe Dean Kamen presented it at TED a few years ago.

360
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
So Amanda, you can see,

361
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
has really good control.

362
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
It's all the pattern recognition.

363
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And it now has a hand that can do different grasps.

364
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
What we do is have the patient go all the way open

365
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and think, "What hand grasp pattern do I want?"

366
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
It goes into that mode,

367
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and then you can do up to five or six different hand grasps with this hand.

368
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Amanda, how many were you able to do with the DEKA arm?

369
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
AK: I was able to get four.

370
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
I had the key grip, I had a chuck grip,

371
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
I had a power grasp

372
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and I had a fine pinch.

373
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
But my favorite one was just when the hand was open,

374
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
because I work with kids,

375
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and so all the time you're clapping and singing,

376
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
so I was able to do that again, which was really good.

377
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
TK: That hand's not so good for clapping.

378
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
AK: Can't clap with this one.

379
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
TK: All right. So that's exciting

380
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
on where we may go with the better mechatronics,

381
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
if we make them good enough

382
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
to put out on the market and use in a field trial.

383
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
I want you to watch closely.

384
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
(Video) Claudia: Oooooh!

385
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
TK: That's Claudia,

386
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and that was the first time

387
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic.

388
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
She had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis

389
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
that then she rubbed over different surfaces,

390
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and she could feel different textures

391
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
of sandpaper, different grits, ribbon cable,

392
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
as it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin.

393
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
She said that when she just ran it across the table,

394
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
it felt like her finger was rocking.

395
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
So that's an exciting laboratory experiment

396
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
on how to give back, potentially, some skin sensation.

397
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
But here's another video that shows some of our challenges.

398
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
This is Jesse, and he's squeezing a foam toy.

399
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And the harder he squeezes -- you see a little black thing in the middle

400
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
that's pushing on his skin proportional to how hard he squeezes.

401
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
But look at all the electrodes around it.

402
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
I've got a real estate problem.

403
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
You're supposed to put a bunch of these things on there,

404
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
but our little motor's making all kinds of noise

405
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
right next to my electrodes.

406
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
So we're really challenged on what we're doing there.

407
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
The future is bright.

408
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
We're excited about where we are and a lot of things we want to do.

409
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
So for example,

410
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
one is to get rid of my real estate problem

411
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and get better signals.

412
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
We want to develop these little tiny capsules

413
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
about the size of a piece of risotto

414
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
that we can put into the muscles

415
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and telemeter out the EMG signals,

416
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
so that it's not worrying about electrode contact.

417
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
And we can have the real estate open

418
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
to try more sensation feedback.

419
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
We want to build a better arm.

420
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
This arm -- they're always made for the 50th percentile male --

421
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
which means they're too big for five-eighths of the world.

422
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
So rather than a super strong or super fast arm,

423
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
we're making an arm that is --

424
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
we're starting with,

425
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
the 25th percentile female --

426
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
that will have a hand that wraps around,

427
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
opens all the way,

428
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
two degrees of freedom in the wrist and an elbow.

429
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
So it'll be the smallest and lightest

430
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
and the smartest arm ever made.

431
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Once we can do it that small,

432
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
it's a lot easier making them bigger.

433
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
So those are just some of our goals.

434
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
And we really appreciate you all being here today.

435
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
I'd like to tell you a little bit about the dark side,

436
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
with yesterday's theme.

437
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
So Amanda came jet-lagged,

438
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
she's using the arm,

439
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
and everything goes wrong.

440
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
There was a computer spook,

441
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
a broken wire,

442
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
a converter that sparked.

443
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
We took out a whole circuit in the hotel

444
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
and just about put on the fire alarm.

445
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
And none of those problems could I have dealt with,

446
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
but I have a really bright research team.

447
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
And thankfully Dr. Annie Simon was with us

448
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
and worked really hard yesterday to fix it.

449
0:18:24.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
That's science.

450
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
And fortunately, it worked today.

451
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
So thank you very much.

452
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
(Applause)

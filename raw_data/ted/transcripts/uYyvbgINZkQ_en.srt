1
0:00:12.717,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I was on a long road trip this summer,

2
0:00:15.167,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and I was having a wonderful time listening

3
0:00:18.245,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to the amazing Isabel Wilkerson's "The Warmth of Other Suns."

4
0:00:22.992,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It documents six million black folks fleeing the South from 1915 to 1970

5
0:00:32.761,000 --> 0:00:35,000
looking for a respite from all the brutality

6
0:00:36.238,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and trying to get to a better opportunity up North,

7
0:00:39.999,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and it was filled with stories of the resilience and the brilliance

8
0:00:44.407,000 --> 0:00:45,000
of African-Americans,

9
0:00:46.362,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and it was also really hard to hear all the stories of the horrors

10
0:00:56.32,000 --> 0:01:,000
It was especially hard to hear about the beatings and the burnings

11
0:01:01.029,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and the lynchings of black men.

12
0:01:03.366,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And I said, "You know, this is a little deep.

13
0:01:06.632,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I need a break. I'm going to turn on the radio."

14
0:01:10.915,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I turned it on, and there it was:

15
0:01:14.061,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Ferguson, Missouri,

16
0:01:16.233,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Michael Brown,

17
0:01:18.445,000 --> 0:01:2,000
18-year-old black man,

18
0:01:20.665,000 --> 0:01:25,000
unarmed, shot by a white police officer, laid on the ground dead,

19
0:01:26.564,000 --> 0:01:29,000
blood running for four hours

20
0:01:30.478,000 --> 0:01:34,000
while his grandmother and little children and his neighbors watched in horror,

21
0:01:34.993,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and I thought,

22
0:01:38.019,000 --> 0:01:41,000
here it is again.

23
0:01:41.24,000 --> 0:01:44,000
This violence, this brutality against black men

24
0:01:44.962,000 --> 0:01:46,000
has been going on for centuries.

25
0:01:47.824,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I mean, it's the same story. It's just different names.

26
0:01:52.396,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It could have been Amadou Diallo.

27
0:01:56.498,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It could have been Sean Bell.

28
0:01:58.823,000 --> 0:02:01,000
It could have been Oscar Grant.

29
0:02:02.213,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It could have been Trayvon Martin.

30
0:02:06.205,000 --> 0:02:08,000
This violence, this brutality,

31
0:02:09.044,000 --> 0:02:11,000
is really something that's part of our national psyche.

32
0:02:11.863,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It's part of our collective history.

33
0:02:14.632,000 --> 0:02:18,000
What are we going to do about it?

34
0:02:19.447,000 --> 0:02:23,000
You know that part of us that still crosses the street,

35
0:02:24.672,000 --> 0:02:26,000
locks the doors,

36
0:02:26.722,000 --> 0:02:28,000
clutches the purses,

37
0:02:29.076,000 --> 0:02:31,000
when we see young black men?

38
0:02:31.962,000 --> 0:02:33,000
That part.

39
0:02:34.023,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I mean, I know we're not shooting people down in the street,

40
0:02:37.971,000 --> 0:02:41,000
but I'm saying that the same stereotypes and prejudices

41
0:02:42.058,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that fuel those kinds of tragic incidents

42
0:02:45.123,000 --> 0:02:47,000
are in us.

43
0:02:47.328,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We've been schooled in them as well.

44
0:02:51.195,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I believe that we can stop these types of incidents,

45
0:02:57.758,000 --> 0:02:59,000
these Fergusons from happening,

46
0:03:00.729,000 --> 0:03:05,000
by looking within and being willing to change ourselves.

47
0:03:06.078,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So I have a call to action for you.

48
0:03:09.369,000 --> 0:03:13,000
There are three things that I want to offer us today to think about

49
0:03:13.454,000 --> 0:03:18,000
as ways to stop Ferguson from happening again;

50
0:03:18.562,000 --> 0:03:2,000
three things that I think will help us

51
0:03:20.861,000 --> 0:03:23,000
reform our images of young black men;

52
0:03:24.336,000 --> 0:03:28,000
three things that I'm hoping will not only protect them

53
0:03:28.652,000 --> 0:03:32,000
but will open the world so that they can thrive.

54
0:03:32.848,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Can you imagine that?

55
0:03:35.149,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Can you imagine our country embracing young black men,

56
0:03:39.7,000 --> 0:03:44,000
seeing them as part of our future, giving them that kind of openness,

57
0:03:45.045,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that kind of grace we give to people we love?

58
0:03:48.758,000 --> 0:03:52,000
How much better would our lives be? How much better would our country be?

59
0:03:53.054,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Let me just start with number one.

60
0:03:55.967,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We gotta get out of denial.

61
0:04:00.956,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Stop trying to be good people.

62
0:04:03.359,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We need real people.

63
0:04:05.503,000 --> 0:04:06,000
You know, I do a lot of diversity work,

64
0:04:07.412,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and people will come up to me at the beginning of the workshop.

65
0:04:10.382,000 --> 0:04:13,000
They're like, "Oh, Ms. Diversity Lady, we're so glad you're here" --

66
0:04:14.067,000 --> 0:04:15,000
(Laughter) --

67
0:04:15.646,000 --> 0:04:18,000
"but we don't have a biased bone in our body."

68
0:04:18.659,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And I'm like, "Really?

69
0:04:20.522,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Because I do this work every day, and I see all my biases."

70
0:04:25.01,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I mean, not too long ago, I was on a plane

71
0:04:28.525,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and I heard the voice of a woman pilot coming over the P.A. system,

72
0:04:32.902,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and I was just so excited, so thrilled.

73
0:04:35.014,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I was like, "Yes, women, we are rocking it.

74
0:04:38.116,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We are now in the stratosphere."

75
0:04:40.326,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It was all good, and then it started getting turbulent and bumpy,

76
0:04:43.46,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and I was like,

77
0:04:44.877,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"I hope she can drive."

78
0:04:47.295,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Laughter)

79
0:04:48.634,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I know. Right.

80
0:04:49.826,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But it's not even like I knew that was a bias

81
0:04:52.068,000 --> 0:04:55,000
until I was coming back on the other leg and there's always a guy driving

82
0:04:55.558,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and it's often turbulent and bumpy,

83
0:04:57.307,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and I've never questioned the confidence of the male driver.

84
0:05:00.133,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The pilot is good.

85
0:05:02.089,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Now, here's the problem.

86
0:05:04.585,000 --> 0:05:11,000
If you ask me explicitly, I would say, "Female pilot: awesome."

87
0:05:12.096,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But it appears that when things get funky and a little troublesome, a little risky,

88
0:05:16.792,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I lean on a bias that I didn't even know that I had.

89
0:05:20.802,000 --> 0:05:22,000
You know, fast-moving planes in the sky,

90
0:05:23.416,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I want a guy.

91
0:05:25.379,000 --> 0:05:27,000
That's my default.

92
0:05:27.662,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Men are my default.

93
0:05:30.291,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Who is your default?

94
0:05:32.611,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Who do you trust?

95
0:05:34.641,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Who are you afraid of?

96
0:05:36.774,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Who do you implicitly feel connected to?

97
0:05:40.805,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Who do you run away from?

98
0:05:43.847,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I'm going to tell you what we have learned.

99
0:05:46.271,000 --> 0:05:51,000
The implicit association test, which measures unconscious bias,

100
0:05:51.669,000 --> 0:05:52,000
you can go online and take it.

101
0:05:53.389,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Five million people have taken it.

102
0:05:55.645,000 --> 0:06:,000
Turns out, our default is white. We like white people.

103
0:06:01.555,000 --> 0:06:03,000
We prefer white. What do I mean by that?

104
0:06:04.315,000 --> 0:06:09,000
When people are shown images of black men and white men,

105
0:06:09.569,000 --> 0:06:12,000
we are more quickly able to associate

106
0:06:13.562,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that picture with a positive word, that white person with a positive word,

107
0:06:17.64,000 --> 0:06:19,000
than we are when we are trying to associate

108
0:06:20.305,000 --> 0:06:23,000
positive with a black face, and vice versa.

109
0:06:24.01,000 --> 0:06:25,000
When we see a black face,

110
0:06:25.9,000 --> 0:06:31,000
it is easier for us to connect black with negative

111
0:06:31.948,000 --> 0:06:33,000
than it is white with negative.

112
0:06:34.075,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Seventy percent of white people taking that test prefer white.

113
0:06:41.039,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Fifty percent of black people taking that test prefer white.

114
0:06:45.753,000 --> 0:06:5,000
You see, we were all outside when the contamination came down.

115
0:06:51.31,000 --> 0:06:57,000
What do we do about the fact that our brain automatically associates?

116
0:06:57.697,000 --> 0:07:02,000
You know, one of the things that you probably are thinking about,

117
0:07:03.306,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and you're probably like, you know what,

118
0:07:05.284,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I'm just going to double down on my color blindness.

119
0:07:08.818,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Yes, I'm going to recommit to that.

120
0:07:10.545,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I'm going to suggest to you, no.

121
0:07:12.662,000 --> 0:07:15,000
We've gone about as far as we can go trying to make a difference

122
0:07:15.821,000 --> 0:07:16,000
trying to not see color.

123
0:07:17.434,000 --> 0:07:21,000
The problem was never that we saw color. It was what we did when we saw the color.

124
0:07:22.269,000 --> 0:07:26,000
It's a false ideal.

125
0:07:26.27,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And while we're busy pretending not to see,

126
0:07:29.04,000 --> 0:07:32,000
we are not being aware of the ways in which racial difference

127
0:07:32.871,000 --> 0:07:37,000
is changing people's possibilities, that's keeping them from thriving,

128
0:07:38.152,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and sometimes it's causing them an early death.

129
0:07:43.339,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So in fact, what the scientists are telling us is, no way.

130
0:07:48.885,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Don't even think about color blindness.

131
0:07:51.28,000 --> 0:07:53,000
In fact, what they're suggesting is,

132
0:07:53.76,000 --> 0:07:57,000
stare at awesome black people.

133
0:07:58.29,000 --> 0:07:59,000
(Laughter)

134
0:08:00.03,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Look at them directly in their faces and memorize them,

135
0:08:04.997,000 --> 0:08:08,000
because when we look at awesome folks who are black,

136
0:08:09.663,000 --> 0:08:12,000
it helps to dissociate

137
0:08:12.872,000 --> 0:08:17,000
the association that happens automatically in our brain.

138
0:08:18.405,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Why do you think I'm showing you these beautiful black men behind me?

139
0:08:23.827,000 --> 0:08:26,000
There were so many, I had to cut them.

140
0:08:27.039,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Okay, so here's the thing:

141
0:08:28.351,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I'm trying to reset your automatic associations about who black men are.

142
0:08:34.279,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I'm trying to remind you

143
0:08:36.641,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that young black men grow up to be amazing human beings

144
0:08:41.665,000 --> 0:08:46,000
who have changed our lives and made them better.

145
0:08:47.371,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So here's the thing.

146
0:08:49.89,000 --> 0:08:51,000
The other possibility in science,

147
0:08:52.441,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and it's only temporarily changing our automatic assumptions,

148
0:08:55.365,000 --> 0:08:57,000
but one thing we know

149
0:08:57.87,000 --> 0:09:01,000
is that if you take a white person who is odious that you know,

150
0:09:02.662,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and stick it up next to a person of color,

151
0:09:05.672,000 --> 0:09:07,000
a black person, who is fabulous,

152
0:09:08.131,000 --> 0:09:11,000
then that sometimes actually causes us to disassociate too.

153
0:09:11.637,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So think Jeffrey Dahmer and Colin Powell.

154
0:09:16.851,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Just stare at them, right? (Laughter)

155
0:09:19.359,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But these are the things. So go looking for your bias.

156
0:09:22.168,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Please, please, just get out of denial and go looking for disconfirming data

157
0:09:26.257,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that will prove that in fact your old stereotypes are wrong.

158
0:09:30.847,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Okay, so that's number one: number two,

159
0:09:32.781,000 --> 0:09:36,000
what I'm going to say is move toward young black men instead of away from them.

160
0:09:37.466,000 --> 0:09:39,000
It's not the hardest thing to do,

161
0:09:40.058,000 --> 0:09:43,000
but it's also one of these things

162
0:09:43.928,000 --> 0:09:45,000
where you have to be conscious and intentional about it.

163
0:09:46.604,000 --> 0:09:49,000
You know, I was in a Wall Street area one time several years ago

164
0:09:49.712,000 --> 0:09:52,000
when I was with a colleague of mine, and she's really wonderful

165
0:09:53.094,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and she does diversity work with me and she's a woman of color, she's Korean.

166
0:09:56.734,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And we were outside, it was late at night,

167
0:09:58.684,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and we were sort of wondering where we were going, we were lost.

168
0:10:01.726,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And I saw this person across the street, and I was thinking, "Oh great, black guy."

169
0:10:05.91,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I was going toward him without even thinking about it.

170
0:10:08.678,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And she was like, "Oh, that's interesting."

171
0:10:12.462,000 --> 0:10:14,000
The guy across the street, he was a black guy.

172
0:10:15.28,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I think black guys generally know where they're going.

173
0:10:18.939,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I don't know why exactly I think that, but that's what I think.

174
0:10:22.584,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So she was saying, "Oh, you were going, 'Yay, a black guy'?"

175
0:10:27.925,000 --> 0:10:3,000
She said, "I was going, 'Ooh, a black guy.'"

176
0:10:30.989,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Other direction. Same need, same guy, same clothes,

177
0:10:34.385,000 --> 0:10:37,000
same time, same street, different reaction.

178
0:10:37.734,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And she said, "I feel so bad. I'm a diversity consultant.

179
0:10:40.463,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I did the black guy thing. I'm a woman of color. Oh my God!"

180
0:10:43.281,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And I said, "You know what? Please. We really need to relax about this."

181
0:10:47.055,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I mean, you've got to realize I go way back with black guys.

182
0:10:50.781,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Laughter)

183
0:10:53.527,000 --> 0:10:56,000
My dad is a black guy. You see what I'm saying?

184
0:10:56.763,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I've got a 6'5" black guy son. I was married to a black guy.

185
0:11:00.703,000 --> 0:11:02,000
My black guy thing is so wide and so deep

186
0:11:03.219,000 --> 0:11:07,000
that I can pretty much sort and figure out who that black guy is,

187
0:11:08.009,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and he was my black guy.

188
0:11:09.959,000 --> 0:11:12,000
He said, "Yes, ladies, I know where you're going. I'll take you there."

189
0:11:13.733,000 --> 0:11:16,000
You know, biases are the stories we make up about people

190
0:11:17.376,000 --> 0:11:19,000
before we know who they actually are.

191
0:11:19.888,000 --> 0:11:21,000
But how are we going to know who they are

192
0:11:22.62,000 --> 0:11:25,000
when we've been told to avoid and be afraid of them?

193
0:11:26.427,000 --> 0:11:31,000
So I'm going to tell you to walk toward your discomfort.

194
0:11:31.48,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And I'm not asking you to take any crazy risks.

195
0:11:34.517,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I'm saying, just do an inventory,

196
0:11:39.417,000 --> 0:11:42,000
expand your social and professional circles.

197
0:11:43.309,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Who's in your circle?

198
0:11:45.139,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Who's missing?

199
0:11:47.635,000 --> 0:11:5,000
How many authentic relationships

200
0:11:51.592,000 --> 0:11:57,000
do you have with young black people, folks, men, women?

201
0:11:58.062,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Or any other major difference from who you are

202
0:12:01.814,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and how you roll, so to speak?

203
0:12:05.15,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Because, you know what? Just look around your periphery.

204
0:12:08.229,000 --> 0:12:1,000
There may be somebody at work, in your classroom,

205
0:12:10.532,000 --> 0:12:13,000
in your house of worship, somewhere, there's some black young guy there.

206
0:12:13.98,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And you're nice. You say hi.

207
0:12:15.438,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I'm saying go deeper, closer, further, and build the kinds of relationships,

208
0:12:21.784,000 --> 0:12:26,000
the kinds of friendships that actually cause you to see the holistic person

209
0:12:27.064,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and to really go against the stereotypes.

210
0:12:30.552,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I know some of you are out there,

211
0:12:35.436,000 --> 0:12:36,000
"You have no idea how awkward I am.

212
0:12:37.408,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Like, I don't think this is going to work for me.

213
0:12:40.14,000 --> 0:12:41,000
I'm sure I'm going to blow this."

214
0:12:41.876,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Okay, maybe, but this thing is not about perfection. It's about connection.

215
0:12:47.835,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And you're not going to get comfortable before you get uncomfortable.

216
0:12:52.839,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I mean, you just have to do it.

217
0:12:54.969,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And young black men, what I'm saying is

218
0:12:57.316,000 --> 0:13:02,000
if someone comes your way, genuinely and authentically, take the invitation.

219
0:13:02.361,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Not everyone is out to get you.

220
0:13:04.211,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Go looking for those people who can see your humanity.

221
0:13:08.691,000 --> 0:13:11,000
You know, it's the empathy and the compassion

222
0:13:12.199,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that comes out of having relationships with people who are different from you.

223
0:13:16.903,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Something really powerful and beautiful happens:

224
0:13:19.898,000 --> 0:13:21,000
you start to realize that they are you,

225
0:13:22.414,000 --> 0:13:27,000
that they are part of you, that they are you in your family,

226
0:13:28.196,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and then we cease to be bystanders

227
0:13:31.194,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and we become actors, we become advocates,

228
0:13:35.179,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and we become allies.

229
0:13:37.677,000 --> 0:13:42,000
So go away from your comfort into a bigger, brighter thing,

230
0:13:43.148,000 --> 0:13:47,000
because that is how we will stop another Ferguson from happening.

231
0:13:48.14,000 --> 0:13:5,000
That's how we create a community

232
0:13:50.37,000 --> 0:13:53,000
where everybody, especially young black men, can thrive.

233
0:13:53.382,000 --> 0:13:55,000
So this last thing is going to be harder,

234
0:13:56.305,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and I know it, but I'm just going to put it out there anyway.

235
0:13:59.173,000 --> 0:14:04,000
When we see something, we have to have the courage to say something,

236
0:14:04.412,000 --> 0:14:07,000
even to the people we love.

237
0:14:08.206,000 --> 0:14:11,000
You know, it's holidays and it's going to be a time

238
0:14:11.847,000 --> 0:14:14,000
when we're sitting around the table and having a good time.

239
0:14:15.279,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Many of us, anyways, will be in holidays,

240
0:14:17.478,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and you've got to listen to the conversations around the table.

241
0:14:22.402,000 --> 0:14:28,000
You start to say things like, "Grandma's a bigot."

242
0:14:29.094,000 --> 0:14:3,000
(Laughter)

243
0:14:30.924,000 --> 0:14:32,000
"Uncle Joe is racist."

244
0:14:33.863,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And you know, we love Grandma and we love Uncle Joe. We do.

245
0:14:38.482,000 --> 0:14:43,000
We know they're good people, but what they're saying is wrong.

246
0:14:45.317,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And we need to be able to say something, because you know who else is at the table?

247
0:14:52.3,000 --> 0:14:54,000
The children are at the table.

248
0:14:55.154,000 --> 0:15:,000
And we wonder why these biases don't die, and move from generation to generation?

249
0:15:00.399,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Because we're not saying anything.

250
0:15:03.65,000 --> 0:15:09,000
We've got to be willing to say, "Grandma, we don't call people that anymore."

251
0:15:10.172,000 --> 0:15:15,000
"Uncle Joe, it isn't true that he deserved that.

252
0:15:15.383,000 --> 0:15:17,000
No one deserves that."

253
0:15:18.319,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And we've got to be willing

254
0:15:21.733,000 --> 0:15:25,000
to not shelter our children from the ugliness of racism

255
0:15:26.507,000 --> 0:15:29,000
when black parents don't have the luxury to do so,

256
0:15:29.819,000 --> 0:15:33,000
especially those who have young black sons.

257
0:15:34.6,000 --> 0:15:37,000
We've got to take our lovely darlings, our future,

258
0:15:37.981,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and we've got to tell them we have an amazing country with incredible ideals,

259
0:15:45.783,000 --> 0:15:47,000
we have worked incredibly hard, and we have made some progress,

260
0:15:48.762,000 --> 0:15:51,000
but we are not done.

261
0:15:51.932,000 --> 0:15:54,000
We still have in us this old stuff

262
0:15:55.926,000 --> 0:15:58,000
about superiority and it is causing us

263
0:15:58.967,000 --> 0:16:01,000
to embed those further into our institutions

264
0:16:02.439,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and our society and generations,

265
0:16:04.418,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and it is making for despair

266
0:16:08.027,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and disparities and a devastating devaluing of young black men.

267
0:16:15.151,000 --> 0:16:17,000
We still struggle, you have to tell them,

268
0:16:17.612,000 --> 0:16:19,000
with seeing both the color

269
0:16:20.39,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and the character of young black men,

270
0:16:24.024,000 --> 0:16:27,000
but that you, and you expect them,

271
0:16:27.857,000 --> 0:16:31,000
to be part of the forces of change in this society

272
0:16:32.371,000 --> 0:16:38,000
that will stand against injustice and is willing, above all other things,

273
0:16:38.939,000 --> 0:16:46,000
to make a society where young black men can be seen for all of who they are.

274
0:16:48.705,000 --> 0:16:52,000
So many amazing black men,

275
0:16:53.627,000 --> 0:17:01,000
those who are the most amazing statesmen that have ever lived,

276
0:17:01.959,000 --> 0:17:04,000
brave soldiers,

277
0:17:04.992,000 --> 0:17:08,000
awesome, hardworking laborers.

278
0:17:09.286,000 --> 0:17:13,000
These are people who are powerful preachers.

279
0:17:13.942,000 --> 0:17:18,000
They are incredible scientists and artists and writers.

280
0:17:19.537,000 --> 0:17:22,000
They are dynamic comedians.

281
0:17:23.512,000 --> 0:17:27,000
They are doting grandpas,

282
0:17:28.448,000 --> 0:17:31,000
caring sons.

283
0:17:31.48,000 --> 0:17:35,000
They are strong fathers,

284
0:17:36.237,000 --> 0:17:4,000
and they are young men with dreams of their own.

285
0:17:40.593,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Thank you.

286
0:17:44.15,000 --> 0:17:48,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12,000 --> 0:00:14,000
It's amazing, when you meet a head of state and you say,

2
0:00:14,000 --> 0:00:18,000
"What is your most precious natural resource?" --

3
0:00:18,000 --> 0:00:2,000
they will not say children at first.

4
0:00:2,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And then when you say children,

5
0:00:22,000 --> 0:00:24,000
they will pretty quickly agree with you.

6
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Video): We're traveling today with

7
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the Minister of Defense of Colombia,

8
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:38,000
head of the army and the head of the police,

9
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and we're dropping off 650 laptops

10
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:43,000
today to children

11
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:45,000
who have no television, no telephone

12
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and have been in a community

13
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
cut off from the rest of the world

14
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:52,000
for the past 40 years.

15
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The importance of delivering laptops to this region

16
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected

17
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:,000
because of the FARC,

18
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the guerrillas that started off 40 years ago

19
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:07,000
as a political movement and then became a drug movement.

20
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
There are one billion children in the world,

21
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and 50 percent of them don't have electricity

22
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:15,000
at home or at school.

23
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And in some countries -- let me pick Afghanistan --

24
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:2,000
75 percent of the little girls don't go to school.

25
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And I don't mean that they drop out of school

26
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:24,000
in the third or fourth grade -- they don't go.

27
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So in the three years

28
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
since I talked at TED and showed a prototype,

29
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:31,000
it's gone from an idea

30
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to a real laptop.

31
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We have half a million laptops today

32
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:39,000
in the hands of children.

33
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:41,000
We have about a quarter of a million in transit

34
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to those and other children,

35
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and then there are another quarter of a million more

36
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that are being ordered at this moment.

37
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So, in rough numbers, there are a million laptops.

38
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:54,000
That's smaller than I predicted --

39
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I predicted three to 10 million --

40
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:58,000
but is still a very large number.

41
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:02,000
In Colombia, we have about 3,000 laptops.

42
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It's the Minister of Defense with whom we're working,

43
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:08,000
not the Minister of Education, because it is seen as

44
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:1,000
a strategic defense issue

45
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in the sense of liberating these zones

46
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that had been completely closed off,

47
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:21,000
in which the people who had been causing, if you will,

48
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:25,000
40 years' worth of bombings and kidnappings

49
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and assassinations lived.

50
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And suddenly,

51
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:31,000
the kids have connected laptops.

52
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
They've leapfrogged.

53
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The change is absolutely monumental,

54
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:39,000
because it's not just opening it up,

55
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:42,000
but it's opening it up to the rest of the world.

56
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So yes, they're building roads, yes, they're putting in telephone,

57
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
yes, there will be television.

58
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But the kids six to 12 years old

59
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:52,000
are surfing the Internet in Spanish and in local languages,

60
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
so the children grow up

61
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:56,000
with access to information,

62
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
with a window into the rest of the world.

63
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Before, they were closed off.

64
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Interestingly enough, in other countries,

65
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:05,000
it will be the Minister of Finance who sees it

66
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:09,000
as an engine of economic growth.

67
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And that engine is going to see the results in 20 years.

68
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It's not going to happen, you know, in one year,

69
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but it's an important, deeply economic

70
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and cultural change

71
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that happens through children.

72
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Thirty-one countries in total are involved,

73
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and in the case of Uruguay,

74
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:31,000
half the children already have them,

75
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and by the middle of 2009,

76
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:37,000
every single child in Uruguay will have a laptop --

77
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:39,000
a little green laptop.

78
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Now what are some of the results?

79
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Some of the results

80
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that go across every single country

81
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:48,000
include teachers saying

82
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:51,000
they have never loved teaching so much,

83
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and reading comprehension

84
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:57,000
measured by third parties -- not by us -- skyrockets.

85
0:03:57,000 --> 0:04:,000
Probably the most important thing we see

86
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:03,000
is children teaching parents.

87
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:06,000
They own the laptops. They take them home.

88
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And so when I met with three children from the schools,

89
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:13,000
who had traveled all day to come to Bogota,

90
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
one of the three children brought her mother.

91
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And the reason she brought her mother

92
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
is that this six-year-old child

93
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:23,000
had been teaching her mother

94
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:25,000
how to read and write.

95
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Her mother had not gone to primary school.

96
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And this is such an inversion,

97
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and such a wonderful example

98
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
of children being the agents of change.

99
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So now, in closing, people say,

100
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:41,000
now why laptops?

101
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Laptops are a luxury; it's like giving them iPods. No.

102
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The reason you want laptops

103
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:5,000
is that the word is education, not laptop.

104
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:53,000
This is an education project, not a laptop project.

105
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:55,000
They need to learn learning. And then, just think --

106
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:57,000
they can have, let's say, 100 books.

107
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:,000
In a village, you have 100 laptops,

108
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:03,000
each with a different set of 100 books,

109
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and so that village suddenly has 10,000 books.

110
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:1,000
You and I didn't have 10,000 books when we went to primary school.

111
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Sometimes school is under a tree,

112
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:16,000
or in many cases, the teacher has only a fifth-grade education,

113
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
so you need a collaborative model of learning,

114
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:21,000
not just building more schools and training more teachers,

115
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:23,000
which you have to do anyway.

116
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So we're once again doing "Give One, Get One."

117
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Last year, we ran a "Give One, Get One" program,

118
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and it generated over 100,000 laptops

119
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that we were then able to give free.

120
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And by being a zero-dollar laptop,

121
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:4,000
we can go to countries that can't afford it at all.

122
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And that's what we did. We went to Haiti,

123
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:45,000
we went to Rwanda, Afghanistan,

124
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Ethiopia, Mongolia.

125
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Places that are not markets,

126
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:53,000
seeding it with the principles of

127
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:56,000
saturation, connectivity, low ages, etc.

128
0:05:56,000 --> 0:06:,000
And then we can actually roll out large numbers.

129
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So think of it this way:

130
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:05,000
think of it as inoculating children

131
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:08,000
against ignorance.

132
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And think of the laptop as a vaccine.

133
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:12,000
You don't vaccinate a few children.

134
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:15,000
You vaccinate all the children in an area.

1
0:00:12.372,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I think we're all aware

2
0:00:14.085,000 --> 0:00:16,000
that the world today is full of problems.

3
0:00:17.058,000 --> 0:00:19,000
We've been hearing them

4
0:00:19.153,000 --> 0:00:23,000
today and yesterday and every day for decades.

5
0:00:23.443,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Serious problems, big problems, pressing problems.

6
0:00:27.487,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Poor nutrition, access to water,

7
0:00:30.843,000 --> 0:00:33,000
climate change, deforestation,

8
0:00:33.88,000 --> 0:00:36,000
lack of skills, insecurity, not enough food,

9
0:00:37.124,000 --> 0:00:39,000
not enough healthcare, pollution.

10
0:00:40.1,000 --> 0:00:41,000
There's problem after problem,

11
0:00:41.845,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and I think what really separates this time

12
0:00:44.376,000 --> 0:00:48,000
from any time I can remember in my brief time

13
0:00:48.5,000 --> 0:00:5,000
on Earth is the awareness of these problems.

14
0:00:50.935,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We're all very aware.

15
0:00:53.501,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Why are we having so much trouble

16
0:00:55.529,000 --> 0:00:56,000
dealing with these problems?

17
0:00:57.36,000 --> 0:01:,000
That's the question I've been struggling with,

18
0:01:00.4,000 --> 0:01:04,000
coming from my very different perspective.

19
0:01:04.569,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I'm not a social problem guy.

20
0:01:07.652,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I'm a guy that works with business,

21
0:01:10.414,000 --> 0:01:13,000
helps business make money.

22
0:01:13.704,000 --> 0:01:16,000
God forbid.

23
0:01:16.938,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So why are we having so many problems

24
0:01:19.992,000 --> 0:01:22,000
with these social problems,

25
0:01:23.135,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and really is there any role for business,

26
0:01:25.192,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and if so, what is that role?

27
0:01:28.725,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I think that in order to address that question,

28
0:01:31.584,000 --> 0:01:34,000
we have to step back and think about

29
0:01:35.45,000 --> 0:01:38,000
how we've understood and pondered

30
0:01:39.105,000 --> 0:01:4,000
both the problems and the solutions

31
0:01:41.103,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to these great social challenges that we face.

32
0:01:45.267,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Now, I think many have seen business

33
0:01:48.101,000 --> 0:01:5,000
as the problem, or at least one of the problems,

34
0:01:50.976,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in many of the social challenges we face.

35
0:01:53.728,000 --> 0:01:54,000
You know, think of the fast food industry,

36
0:01:55.134,000 --> 0:01:56,000
the drug industry, the banking industry.

37
0:01:57.109,000 --> 0:01:59,000
You know, this is a low point

38
0:01:59.288,000 --> 0:02:01,000
in the respect for business.

39
0:02:02.279,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Business is not seen as the solution.

40
0:02:03.989,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It's seen as the problem now, for most people.

41
0:02:07.73,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And rightly so, in many cases.

42
0:02:09.704,000 --> 0:02:11,000
There's a lot of bad actors out there

43
0:02:11.983,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that have done the wrong thing,

44
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that actually have made the problem worse.

45
0:02:15.961,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So this perspective is perhaps justified.

46
0:02:19.424,000 --> 0:02:21,000
How have we tended to see the solutions

47
0:02:22.014,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to these social problems,

48
0:02:24.35,000 --> 0:02:27,000
these many issues that we face in society?

49
0:02:27.512,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Well, we've tended to see the solutions

50
0:02:29.144,000 --> 0:02:31,000
in terms of NGOs,

51
0:02:31.296,000 --> 0:02:33,000
in terms of government,

52
0:02:33.302,000 --> 0:02:35,000
in terms of philanthropy.

53
0:02:35.439,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Indeed, the kind of unique organizational entity

54
0:02:37.873,000 --> 0:02:41,000
of this age is this tremendous rise of NGOs

55
0:02:42.63,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and social organizations.

56
0:02:45.136,000 --> 0:02:47,000
This is a unique, new organizational form

57
0:02:47.96,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that we've seen grown up.

58
0:02:49.153,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Enormous innovation, enormous energy,

59
0:02:52.56,000 --> 0:02:54,000
enormous talent now has been mobilized

60
0:02:55.295,000 --> 0:02:57,000
through this structure

61
0:02:57.415,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to try to deal with all of these challenges.

62
0:03:02.268,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And many of us here are deeply involved in that.

63
0:03:06.525,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I'm a business school professor,

64
0:03:08.034,000 --> 0:03:12,000
but I've actually founded, I think, now, four nonprofits.

65
0:03:12.049,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Whenever I got interested and became aware

66
0:03:14.938,000 --> 0:03:17,000
of a societal problem, that was what I did,

67
0:03:17.998,000 --> 0:03:18,000
form a nonprofit.

68
0:03:19.876,000 --> 0:03:22,000
That was the way we've thought about how to deal

69
0:03:22.939,000 --> 0:03:23,000
with these issues.

70
0:03:23.948,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Even a business school professor has thought about it that way.

71
0:03:28.4,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But I think at this moment,

72
0:03:30.235,000 --> 0:03:32,000
we've been at this for quite a while.

73
0:03:33.004,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We've been aware of these problems for decades.

74
0:03:35.856,000 --> 0:03:36,000
We have decades of experience

75
0:03:37.766,000 --> 0:03:41,000
with our NGOs and with our government entities,

76
0:03:42.091,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and there's an awkward reality.

77
0:03:43.92,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The awkward reality is we're not making

78
0:03:45.862,000 --> 0:03:47,000
fast enough progress.

79
0:03:48.446,000 --> 0:03:5,000
We're not winning.

80
0:03:51.17,000 --> 0:03:53,000
These problems still seem very daunting

81
0:03:53.254,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and very intractable,

82
0:03:54.46,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and any solutions we're achieving

83
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
are small solutions.

84
0:03:59.1,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We're making incremental progress.

85
0:04:02.982,000 --> 0:04:04,000
What's the fundamental problem we have

86
0:04:05.704,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in dealing with these social problems?

87
0:04:08.782,000 --> 0:04:12,000
If we cut all the complexity away,

88
0:04:12.814,000 --> 0:04:15,000
we have the problem of scale.

89
0:04:16.193,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We can't scale.

90
0:04:19.304,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We can make progress. We can show benefits.

91
0:04:22.231,000 --> 0:04:25,000
We can show results. We can make things better.

92
0:04:25.559,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We're helping. We're doing better. We're doing good.

93
0:04:29.837,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We can't scale.

94
0:04:32.191,000 --> 0:04:36,000
We can't make a large-scale impact on these problems.

95
0:04:37.157,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Why is that?

96
0:04:38.991,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Because we don't have the resources.

97
0:04:42.581,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And that's really clear now.

98
0:04:44.292,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And that's clearer now than it's been for decades.

99
0:04:47.174,000 --> 0:04:5,000
There's simply not enough money

100
0:04:50.726,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to deal with any of these problems at scale

101
0:04:54.117,000 --> 0:04:56,000
using the current model.

102
0:04:56.442,000 --> 0:04:59,000
There's not enough tax revenue,

103
0:04:59.512,000 --> 0:05:03,000
there's not enough philanthropic donations,

104
0:05:03.558,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to deal with these problems the way we're dealing with them now.

105
0:05:06.006,000 --> 0:05:11,000
We've got to confront that reality.

106
0:05:11.171,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And the scarcity of resources

107
0:05:14.23,000 --> 0:05:18,000
for dealing with these problems is only growing,

108
0:05:18.257,000 --> 0:05:21,000
certainly in the advanced world today,

109
0:05:21.807,000 --> 0:05:25,000
with all the fiscal problems we face.

110
0:05:26.186,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So if it's fundamentally a resource problem,

111
0:05:30.431,000 --> 0:05:34,000
where are the resources in society?

112
0:05:34.476,000 --> 0:05:36,000
How are those resources really created,

113
0:05:36.861,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the resources we're going to need to deal

114
0:05:38.568,000 --> 0:05:41,000
with all these societal challenges?

115
0:05:42.208,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Well there, I think the answer is very clear:

116
0:05:45.324,000 --> 0:05:48,000
They're in business.

117
0:05:49.01,000 --> 0:05:54,000
All wealth is actually created by business.

118
0:05:54.621,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Business creates wealth

119
0:05:57.347,000 --> 0:06:02,000
when it meets needs at a profit.

120
0:06:02.393,000 --> 0:06:04,000
That's how all wealth is created.

121
0:06:04.857,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It's meeting needs at a profit

122
0:06:07.23,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that leads to taxes

123
0:06:09.642,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and that leads to incomes

124
0:06:11.311,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and that leads to charitable donations.

125
0:06:13.578,000 --> 0:06:16,000
That's where all the resources come from.

126
0:06:16.829,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Only business can actually create resources.

127
0:06:19.287,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Other institutions can utilize them

128
0:06:21.241,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to do important work,

129
0:06:22.466,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but only business can create them.

130
0:06:25.65,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And business creates them

131
0:06:27.171,000 --> 0:06:34,000
when it's able to meet a need at a profit.

132
0:06:35.049,000 --> 0:06:38,000
The resources are overwhelmingly

133
0:06:38.433,000 --> 0:06:39,000
generated by business.

134
0:06:40.322,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The question then is, how do we tap into this?

135
0:06:45.625,000 --> 0:06:47,000
How do we tap into this?

136
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Business generates those resources

137
0:06:50.947,000 --> 0:06:54,000
when it makes a profit.

138
0:06:55.616,000 --> 0:06:58,000
That profit is that small difference

139
0:06:58.99,000 --> 0:07:02,000
between the price and the cost it takes to produce

140
0:07:03.836,000 --> 0:07:05,000
whatever solution business has created

141
0:07:06.153,000 --> 0:07:09,000
to whatever problem they're trying to solve.

142
0:07:09.376,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But that profit is the magic.

143
0:07:16.136,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Why? Because that profit allows whatever solution

144
0:07:20.89,000 --> 0:07:22,000
we've created

145
0:07:23.109,000 --> 0:07:27,000
to be infinitely scalable.

146
0:07:27.299,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Because if we can make a profit,

147
0:07:29.9,000 --> 0:07:32,000
we can do it for 10, 100, a million,

148
0:07:33.424,000 --> 0:07:36,000
100 million, a billion.

149
0:07:36.716,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The solution becomes self-sustaining.

150
0:07:41.436,000 --> 0:07:43,000
That's what business does

151
0:07:44.035,000 --> 0:07:47,000
when it makes a profit.

152
0:07:47.645,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Now what does this all have to do

153
0:07:50.029,000 --> 0:07:53,000
with social problems?

154
0:07:53.097,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Well, one line of thinking is, let's take this profit

155
0:07:56.379,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and redeploy it into social problems.

156
0:08:01.928,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Business should give more.

157
0:08:03.194,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Business should be more responsible.

158
0:08:04.618,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And that's been the path that we've been on

159
0:08:07.068,000 --> 0:08:09,000
in business.

160
0:08:09.754,000 --> 0:08:1,000
But again, this path that we've been on

161
0:08:11.618,000 --> 0:08:15,000
is not getting us where we need to go.

162
0:08:15.958,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Now, I started out as a strategy professor,

163
0:08:19.106,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and I'm still a strategy professor.

164
0:08:20.612,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I'm proud of that.

165
0:08:21.971,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But I've also, over the years,

166
0:08:23.497,000 --> 0:08:25,000
worked more and more on social issues.

167
0:08:26.153,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I've worked on healthcare, the environment,

168
0:08:29.42,000 --> 0:08:32,000
economic development, reducing poverty,

169
0:08:32.992,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and as I worked more and more in the social field,

170
0:08:37.337,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I started seeing something

171
0:08:38.899,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that had a profound impact on me

172
0:08:42.169,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and my whole life, in a way.

173
0:08:45.755,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The conventional wisdom in economics

174
0:08:49.544,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and the view in business has historically been

175
0:08:53.412,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that actually, there's a tradeoff

176
0:08:57.369,000 --> 0:09:02,000
between social performance and economic performance.

177
0:09:02.377,000 --> 0:09:03,000
The conventional wisdom has been

178
0:09:03.861,000 --> 0:09:06,000
that business actually makes a profit

179
0:09:06.931,000 --> 0:09:07,000
by causing a social problem.

180
0:09:08.724,000 --> 0:09:1,000
The classic example is pollution.

181
0:09:10.906,000 --> 0:09:12,000
If business pollutes, it makes more money

182
0:09:13.682,000 --> 0:09:17,000
than if it tried to reduce that pollution.

183
0:09:18.323,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Reducing pollution is expensive,

184
0:09:20.214,000 --> 0:09:25,000
therefore businesses don't want to do it.

185
0:09:25.697,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It's profitable to have an unsafe working environment.

186
0:09:28.642,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It's too expensive to have a safe working environment,

187
0:09:31.38,000 --> 0:09:32,000
therefore business makes more money

188
0:09:32.686,000 --> 0:09:33,000
if they don't have a safe working environment.

189
0:09:34.526,000 --> 0:09:37,000
That's been the conventional wisdom.

190
0:09:38.023,000 --> 0:09:4,000
A lot of companies have fallen into that conventional wisdom.

191
0:09:40.836,000 --> 0:09:42,000
They resisted environmental improvement.

192
0:09:43.379,000 --> 0:09:48,000
They resisted workplace improvement.

193
0:09:48.813,000 --> 0:09:51,000
That thinking has led to, I think,

194
0:09:52.359,000 --> 0:09:53,000
much of the behavior

195
0:09:53.879,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that we have come to criticize in business,

196
0:09:55.815,000 --> 0:09:57,000
that I come to criticize in business.

197
0:09:58.335,000 --> 0:10:01,000
But the more deeply I got into all these social issues,

198
0:10:01.868,000 --> 0:10:04,000
one after another,

199
0:10:04.88,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and actually, the more I tried to address them

200
0:10:07.326,000 --> 0:10:09,000
myself, personally, in a few cases,

201
0:10:09.442,000 --> 0:10:11,000
through nonprofits that I was involved with,

202
0:10:12.171,000 --> 0:10:14,000
the more I found actually that the reality

203
0:10:15.109,000 --> 0:10:17,000
is the opposite.

204
0:10:17.643,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Business does not profit

205
0:10:18.889,000 --> 0:10:19,000
from causing social problems,

206
0:10:20.591,000 --> 0:10:24,000
actually not in any fundamental sense.

207
0:10:24.965,000 --> 0:10:26,000
That's a very simplistic view.

208
0:10:27.158,000 --> 0:10:29,000
The deeper we get into these issues,

209
0:10:29.866,000 --> 0:10:3,000
the more we start to understand

210
0:10:31.711,000 --> 0:10:32,000
that actually business profits

211
0:10:33.612,000 --> 0:10:34,000
from solving from social problems.

212
0:10:35.608,000 --> 0:10:37,000
That's where the real profit comes.

213
0:10:38.152,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Let's take pollution.

214
0:10:40.993,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We've learned today that actually

215
0:10:43.209,000 --> 0:10:45,000
reducing pollution and emissions

216
0:10:45.616,000 --> 0:10:48,000
is generating profit.

217
0:10:49.122,000 --> 0:10:51,000
It saves money.

218
0:10:51.19,000 --> 0:10:52,000
It makes the business more productive and efficient.

219
0:10:52.888,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It doesn't waste resources.

220
0:10:54.285,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Having a safer working environment actually,

221
0:10:56.928,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and avoiding accidents,

222
0:10:58.416,000 --> 0:10:59,000
it makes the business more profitable,

223
0:10:59.788,000 --> 0:11:02,000
because it's a sign of good processes.

224
0:11:02.996,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Accidents are expensive and costly.

225
0:11:07.027,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Issue by issue by issue, we start to learn

226
0:11:09.631,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that actually there's no trade-off

227
0:11:12.597,000 --> 0:11:15,000
between social progress

228
0:11:16.193,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and economic efficiency

229
0:11:19.194,000 --> 0:11:21,000
in any fundamental sense.

230
0:11:21.287,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Another issue is health.

231
0:11:22.646,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I mean, what we've found is actually

232
0:11:25.215,000 --> 0:11:26,000
health of employees is something

233
0:11:27.097,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that business should treasure,

234
0:11:28.49,000 --> 0:11:3,000
because that health allows those employees

235
0:11:30.818,000 --> 0:11:31,000
to be more productive and come to work

236
0:11:32.227,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and not be absent.

237
0:11:34.543,000 --> 0:11:37,000
The deeper work, the new work, the new thinking

238
0:11:37.967,000 --> 0:11:41,000
on the interface between business and social problems

239
0:11:42.151,000 --> 0:11:44,000
is actually showing that there's a fundamental,

240
0:11:45.069,000 --> 0:11:46,000
deep synergy,

241
0:11:46.988,000 --> 0:11:49,000
particularly if you're not thinking in the very short run.

242
0:11:50.916,000 --> 0:11:51,000
In the very short run, you can sometimes

243
0:11:52.754,000 --> 0:11:54,000
fool yourself into thinking

244
0:11:54.855,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that there's fundamentally opposing goals,

245
0:11:57.15,000 --> 0:11:59,000
but in the long run, ultimately, we're learning

246
0:11:59.963,000 --> 0:12:03,000
in field after field that this is simply not true.

247
0:12:04.159,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So how could we tap into

248
0:12:07.449,000 --> 0:12:09,000
the power of business

249
0:12:10.171,000 --> 0:12:12,000
to address the fundamental problems

250
0:12:12.374,000 --> 0:12:14,000
that we face?

251
0:12:14.807,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Imagine if we could do that, because if we could do it,

252
0:12:17.407,000 --> 0:12:19,000
we could scale.

253
0:12:19.447,000 --> 0:12:21,000
We could tap into this enormous resource pool

254
0:12:21.856,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and this organizational capacity.

255
0:12:24.754,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And guess what? That's happening now, finally,

256
0:12:30.244,000 --> 0:12:34,000
partly because of people like you

257
0:12:34.257,000 --> 0:12:35,000
who have raised these issues now

258
0:12:36.205,000 --> 0:12:39,000
for year after year and decade after decade.

259
0:12:39.32,000 --> 0:12:41,000
We see organizations like Dow Chemical

260
0:12:41.728,000 --> 0:12:42,000
leading the revolution away from trans fat

261
0:12:43.646,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and saturated fat with innovative new products.

262
0:12:46.778,000 --> 0:12:47,000
This is an example of Jain Irrigation.

263
0:12:48.731,000 --> 0:12:5,000
This is a company that's brought drip irrigation technology

264
0:12:51.282,000 --> 0:12:53,000
to thousands and millions of farmers,

265
0:12:53.951,000 --> 0:12:56,000
reducing substantially the use of water.

266
0:12:57.002,000 --> 0:13:,000
We see companies like the Brazilian forestry company Fibria

267
0:13:00.323,000 --> 0:13:01,000
that's figured out how to avoid

268
0:13:01.806,000 --> 0:13:02,000
tearing down old growth forest

269
0:13:03.685,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and using eucalyptus and getting much more yield

270
0:13:06.461,000 --> 0:13:07,000
per hectare of pulp

271
0:13:08.451,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and making much more paper than you could make

272
0:13:10.419,000 --> 0:13:12,000
by cutting down those old trees.

273
0:13:12.528,000 --> 0:13:14,000
You see companies like Cisco that are training

274
0:13:15.408,000 --> 0:13:19,000
so far four million people in I.T. skills

275
0:13:19.564,000 --> 0:13:2,000
to actually, yes, be responsible,

276
0:13:21.507,000 --> 0:13:23,000
but help expand the opportunity

277
0:13:23.938,000 --> 0:13:25,000
to disseminate I.T. technology

278
0:13:26.211,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and grow the whole business.

279
0:13:27.513,000 --> 0:13:31,000
There's a fundamental opportunity for business today

280
0:13:32.134,000 --> 0:13:36,000
to impact and address these social problems,

281
0:13:36.19,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and this opportunity

282
0:13:37.514,000 --> 0:13:4,000
is the largest business opportunity

283
0:13:40.782,000 --> 0:13:43,000
we see in business.

284
0:13:44.448,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And the question is, how can we get business

285
0:13:46.654,000 --> 0:13:49,000
thinking to adapt this issue of shared value?

286
0:13:50.082,000 --> 0:13:51,000
This is what I call shared value:

287
0:13:51.891,000 --> 0:13:54,000
addressing a social issue with a business model.

288
0:13:55.646,000 --> 0:13:56,000
That's shared value.

289
0:13:57.57,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Shared value is capitalism,

290
0:13:59.399,000 --> 0:14:01,000
but it's a higher kind of capitalism.

291
0:14:01.961,000 --> 0:14:04,000
It's capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be,

292
0:14:05.321,000 --> 0:14:08,000
meeting important needs,

293
0:14:08.734,000 --> 0:14:1,000
not incrementally competing for

294
0:14:11.557,000 --> 0:14:14,000
trivial differences in product attributes

295
0:14:14.82,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and market share.

296
0:14:16.553,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Shared value is when we can create social value

297
0:14:18.772,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and economic value simultaneously.

298
0:14:21.375,000 --> 0:14:23,000
It's finding those opportunities

299
0:14:23.885,000 --> 0:14:26,000
that will unleash the greatest possibility we have

300
0:14:26.95,000 --> 0:14:27,000
to actually address these social problems

301
0:14:28.941,000 --> 0:14:3,000
because we can scale.

302
0:14:30.974,000 --> 0:14:33,000
We can address shared value at multiple levels.

303
0:14:34.53,000 --> 0:14:37,000
It's real. It's happening.

304
0:14:37.695,000 --> 0:14:39,000
But in order to get this solution working,

305
0:14:40.588,000 --> 0:14:44,000
we have to now change how business sees itself,

306
0:14:44.716,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and this is thankfully underway.

307
0:14:47.23,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Businesses got trapped into the conventional wisdom

308
0:14:50.706,000 --> 0:14:51,000
that they shouldn't worry about social problems,

309
0:14:52.554,000 --> 0:14:54,000
that this was sort of something on the side,

310
0:14:54.596,000 --> 0:14:56,000
that somebody else was doing it.

311
0:14:57.177,000 --> 0:14:58,000
We're now seeing companies

312
0:14:58.753,000 --> 0:15:,000
embrace this idea.

313
0:15:01.229,000 --> 0:15:03,000
But we also have to recognize business

314
0:15:03.418,000 --> 0:15:05,000
is not going to do this as effectively

315
0:15:06.162,000 --> 0:15:07,000
as if we have NGOs and government

316
0:15:08.022,000 --> 0:15:11,000
working in partnership with business.

317
0:15:11.053,000 --> 0:15:14,000
The new NGOs that are really moving the needle

318
0:15:14.061,000 --> 0:15:16,000
are the ones that have found these partnerships,

319
0:15:16.244,000 --> 0:15:17,000
that have found these ways to collaborate.

320
0:15:18.061,000 --> 0:15:2,000
The governments that are making the most progress

321
0:15:20.534,000 --> 0:15:21,000
are the governments that have found ways

322
0:15:22.148,000 --> 0:15:25,000
to enable shared value in business

323
0:15:25.799,000 --> 0:15:28,000
rather than see government as the only player

324
0:15:28.92,000 --> 0:15:31,000
that has to call the shots.

325
0:15:31.934,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And government has many ways in which it could impact

326
0:15:34.406,000 --> 0:15:36,000
the willingness and the ability of companies

327
0:15:36.72,000 --> 0:15:37,000
to compete in this way.

328
0:15:38.714,000 --> 0:15:4,000
I think if we can get business seeing itself differently,

329
0:15:41.663,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and if we can get others seeing business differently,

330
0:15:44.206,000 --> 0:15:46,000
we can change the world.

331
0:15:47.011,000 --> 0:15:5,000
I know it. I'm seeing it.

332
0:15:50.216,000 --> 0:15:51,000
I'm feeling it.

333
0:15:52.166,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Young people, I think,

334
0:15:53.861,000 --> 0:15:56,000
my Harvard Business School students, are getting it.

335
0:15:57.041,000 --> 0:16:01,000
If we can break down this sort of divide,

336
0:16:01.363,000 --> 0:16:04,000
this unease, this tension,

337
0:16:04.373,000 --> 0:16:05,000
this sense that we're not

338
0:16:06.303,000 --> 0:16:08,000
fundamentally collaborating here

339
0:16:08.543,000 --> 0:16:1,000
in driving these social problems,

340
0:16:10.893,000 --> 0:16:12,000
we can break this down,

341
0:16:12.997,000 --> 0:16:14,000
and we finally, I think,

342
0:16:14.997,000 --> 0:16:16,000
can have solutions.

343
0:16:17.629,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Thank you.

344
0:16:20.429,000 --> 0:16:22,000

1
0:00:12.99,000 --> 0:00:21,000
this is Henry a cute boy and when Henry

2
0:00:18.009,000 --> 0:00:26,000
was three his mom found him having some

3
0:00:22.24,000 --> 0:00:28,000
febrile seizures febrile seizures are

4
0:00:26.109,000 --> 0:00:32,000
seizures that occur when you also have a

5
0:00:28.449,000 --> 0:00:35,000
fever and the doctor said don't worry

6
0:00:32.32,000 --> 0:00:38,000
too much kids usually outgrow these when

7
0:00:35.65,000 --> 0:00:4,000
he was four he had a convulsive seizure

8
0:00:39.04,000 --> 0:00:44,000
the kind that you lose consciousness and

9
0:00:41.62,000 --> 0:00:5,000
shake generalized tonic-clonic seizure

10
0:00:44.98,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and while the diagnosis of epilepsy was

11
0:00:50.92,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in the mail Henry's mom went to get him

12
0:00:55.51,000 --> 0:01:03,000
out of bed one morning and as she went

13
0:00:58.059,000 --> 0:01:1,000
in his room she found his cold lifeless

14
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:13,000
body Henry died of SUDEP sudden

15
0:01:10.36,000 --> 0:01:15,000
unexpected death and epilepsy I'm

16
0:01:13.84,000 --> 0:01:17,000
curious how many of you have heard of

17
0:01:16.06,000 --> 0:01:21,000
SUDEP this is a very well-educated

18
0:01:18.58,000 --> 0:01:24,000
audience and I see only a few hands

19
0:01:21.42,000 --> 0:01:26,000
SUDEP is when a otherwise healthy person

20
0:01:24.759,000 --> 0:01:27,000
with epilepsy dies and they can't

21
0:01:26.979,000 --> 0:01:33,000
attribute it to anything they can find

22
0:01:28.75,000 --> 0:01:36,000
in an autopsy there is a suit up every

23
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:45,000
seven to nine minutes that's on average

24
0:01:37.209,000 --> 0:01:47,000
two per TEDTalk now a normal brain has

25
0:01:45.239,000 --> 0:01:49,000
electrical activity you could see some

26
0:01:47.979,000 --> 0:01:52,000
of the electrical waves coming out of

27
0:01:49.69,000 --> 0:01:54,000
this picture of a brain here and these

28
0:01:53.289,000 --> 0:01:57,000
should look like typical electrical

29
0:01:55.39,000 --> 0:01:59,000
activity that an EEG could read on the

30
0:01:57.489,000 --> 0:02:01,000
surface when you have a seizure

31
0:01:59.679,000 --> 0:02:03,000
it's a bit of unusual electrical

32
0:02:02.17,000 --> 0:02:05,000
activity and it can be focal it can take

33
0:02:04.27,000 --> 0:02:08,000
place in just a small part of your brain

34
0:02:05.92,000 --> 0:02:1,000
when that happens you might have a

35
0:02:08.59,000 --> 0:02:12,000
strange sensation one could be happening

36
0:02:11.319,000 --> 0:02:13,000
several could be happening here in the

37
0:02:12.64,000 --> 0:02:16,000
audience right now and the person next

38
0:02:14.23,000 --> 0:02:18,000
you might not even know however if you

39
0:02:16.99,000 --> 0:02:2,000
have a seizure where that little brush

40
0:02:18.64,000 --> 0:02:23,000
fire spreads like a forest fire over

41
0:02:21.31,000 --> 0:02:26,000
the brain then it generalizes and that

42
0:02:24.069,000 --> 0:02:29,000
generalized seizure takes your

43
0:02:26.73,000 --> 0:02:32,000
consciousness away and causes you to

44
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
convulse there are more students in the

45
0:02:33.28,000 --> 0:02:36,000
United States

46
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:39,000
every year then sudden infant death

47
0:02:36.37,000 --> 0:02:4,000
syndrome now how many of you've heard of

48
0:02:39.55,000 --> 0:02:43,000
sudden infant death syndrome all right

49
0:02:41.2,000 --> 0:02:45,000
pretty much every hand goes up so what's

50
0:02:44.019,000 --> 0:02:49,000
going on here why is this so much more

51
0:02:46.12,000 --> 0:02:52,000
common and yet people haven't heard of

52
0:02:49.51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
it and what can you do to prevent it

53
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
well there are two things scientifically

54
0:02:54.31,000 --> 0:03:,000
shown that prevent or reduce the risk of

55
0:02:57.79,000 --> 0:03:02,000
SUDEP the first is follow your doctor's

56
0:03:00.67,000 --> 0:03:05,000
instructions take your medications 2/3

57
0:03:03.64,000 --> 0:03:05,000
of people who have epilepsy get it under

58
0:03:05.83,000 --> 0:03:08,000
control

59
0:03:06.22,000 --> 0:03:1,000
with their medications the second thing

60
0:03:08.86,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that reduces the risk of Sudha is

61
0:03:10.63,000 --> 0:03:16,000
companionship it's having somebody there

62
0:03:13.959,000 --> 0:03:19,000
at the time that you have a seizure now

63
0:03:16.93,000 --> 0:03:21,000
suit up even though most of you've never

64
0:03:20.17,000 --> 0:03:25,000
heard of it is actually the number two

65
0:03:22.299,000 --> 0:03:29,000
cause of years of potential life lost of

66
0:03:26.109,000 --> 0:03:34,000
all neurological disorders the vertical

67
0:03:29.709,000 --> 0:03:37,000
axis is the number of deaths times the

68
0:03:34.35,000 --> 0:03:41,000
remaining lifespan so higher is much

69
0:03:38.17,000 --> 0:03:44,000
worse impact suit-up however unlike

70
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
these others is something that people

71
0:03:45.01,000 --> 0:03:52,000
right here could do something to push

72
0:03:47.739,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that down now what is what is Roz picard

73
0:03:52.78,000 --> 0:03:56,000
as an AI researcher doing here telling

74
0:03:55.63,000 --> 0:04:,000
you about pseudo right I'm not a

75
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
neurologist when I was working at the

76
0:04:00.7,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Media Lab on measurement of emotion

77
0:04:03.489,000 --> 0:04:06,000
trying to make our machines more

78
0:04:04.72,000 --> 0:04:07,000
intelligent about our emotions we

79
0:04:06.97,000 --> 0:04:12,000
started doing a lot of work measuring

80
0:04:08.56,000 --> 0:04:14,000
stress we built lots of sensors that

81
0:04:13.18,000 --> 0:04:18,000
measured it in lots of different ways

82
0:04:14.95,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but one of them in particular grew out

83
0:04:18.37,000 --> 0:04:21,000
of some of this very old work with

84
0:04:20.56,000 --> 0:04:24,000
measuring sweaty palms with an

85
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
electrical signal this is a signal skin

86
0:04:24.91,000 --> 0:04:27,000
conductance that's known to go up when

87
0:04:26.38,000 --> 0:04:29,000
you get nervous but it turns out it also

88
0:04:28.539,000 --> 0:04:31,000
goes up with a lot of other interesting

89
0:04:30.07,000 --> 0:04:33,000
conditions but measuring it with wires

90
0:04:32.05,000 --> 0:04:34,000
on your hand is really inconvenient so

91
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:36,000
we in

92
0:04:34.99,000 --> 0:04:38,000
a bunch of other ways of doing this at

93
0:04:36.669,000 --> 0:04:4,000
the MIT Media Lab and with these

94
0:04:39.34,000 --> 0:04:44,000
wearables we started to collect the

95
0:04:41.5,000 --> 0:04:47,000
first ever clinical quality data 24/7

96
0:04:44.97,000 --> 0:04:49,000
here's a picture of what that looked

97
0:04:47.949,000 --> 0:04:52,000
like the first time that an MIT student

98
0:04:50.199,000 --> 0:04:56,000
collected skin conductance on the wrist

99
0:04:53.13,000 --> 0:05:,000
24/7 let's zoom in a little bit here

100
0:04:56.889,000 --> 0:05:01,000
what you see is 24 hours from left to

101
0:05:00.28,000 --> 0:05:06,000
right and here's two days of data and

102
0:05:02.37,000 --> 0:05:08,000
first what surprised us was the sleep

103
0:05:06.31,000 --> 0:05:1,000
was the biggest peak of the day now that

104
0:05:08.919,000 --> 0:05:12,000
sounds broken right how I mean you're

105
0:05:11.289,000 --> 0:05:13,000
calm when you're asleep so what's going

106
0:05:13.449,000 --> 0:05:16,000
on here

107
0:05:13.96,000 --> 0:05:17,000
well it turns out that our physiology

108
0:05:16.479,000 --> 0:05:2,000
during sleep is very different than our

109
0:05:18.13,000 --> 0:05:22,000
physiology during wake and while there's

110
0:05:20.919,000 --> 0:05:23,000
still a bit of a mystery why these Peaks

111
0:05:22.99,000 --> 0:05:24,000
are usually the biggest of the day

112
0:05:24.46,000 --> 0:05:27,000
during sleep

113
0:05:25.449,000 --> 0:05:29,000
we now believe they're related to memory

114
0:05:27.699,000 --> 0:05:32,000
consolidation and memory formation

115
0:05:29.949,000 --> 0:05:35,000
during sleep we also saw things that

116
0:05:33.07,000 --> 0:05:37,000
were exactly what we expected when an

117
0:05:36.099,000 --> 0:05:4,000
MIT student is working hard in the lab

118
0:05:37.81,000 --> 0:05:41,000
or on homeworks there it's not only

119
0:05:40.86,000 --> 0:05:44,000
emotional stress but there's cognitive

120
0:05:42.789,000 --> 0:05:47,000
load and it turns out that cognitive

121
0:05:45.19,000 --> 0:05:5,000
load cognitive effort mental engagement

122
0:05:48.539,000 --> 0:05:54,000
excitement about learning something

123
0:05:50.53,000 --> 0:05:56,000
those things also make the signal go up

124
0:05:54.87,000 --> 0:06:,000
unfortunately to the embarrassment of we

125
0:05:57.25,000 --> 0:06:05,000
MIT professors the low point everyday

126
0:06:01.53,000 --> 0:06:06,000
classroom activity now I am just showing

127
0:06:05.8,000 --> 0:06:11,000
you one person's day two here but this

128
0:06:07.09,000 --> 0:06:15,000
unfortunately is true in general this

129
0:06:12.669,000 --> 0:06:17,000
sweatband has inside it a home built

130
0:06:15.19,000 --> 0:06:2,000
skin conductance sensor and one day one

131
0:06:18.039,000 --> 0:06:23,000
of our undergrads knocked on my door

132
0:06:21.18,000 --> 0:06:26,000
right at the end of the December

133
0:06:23.56,000 --> 0:06:28,000
semester and he said Russ supercard can

134
0:06:26.949,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I please borrow one of your wristband

135
0:06:29.05,000 --> 0:06:34,000
sensors my little brother has autism

136
0:06:31.57,000 --> 0:06:36,000
he can't talk and I want to see what's

137
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
stressing him out and I said sure in

138
0:06:37.36,000 --> 0:06:41,000
fact don't just take one take two

139
0:06:39.06,000 --> 0:06:43,000
because they broke easily back then so

140
0:06:42.28,000 --> 0:06:44,000
he took them home he put them on his

141
0:06:43.9,000 --> 0:06:47,000
little brother now I was back in MIT

142
0:06:45.219,000 --> 0:06:5,000
looking at the data on my laptop

143
0:06:48.19,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and the first day I thought I thought he

144
0:06:50.83,000 --> 0:06:54,000
put them on both wrists instead of

145
0:06:52.36,000 --> 0:06:56,000
waiting for one to break okay fine don't

146
0:06:54.88,000 --> 0:06:59,000
follow my instructions I'm glad he

147
0:06:56.77,000 --> 0:07:03,000
didn't second day chill look like

148
0:07:00.04,000 --> 0:07:09,000
classroom activity few more days ahead

149
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:12,000
the next day one wrist signal was flat

150
0:07:09.52,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and the other had the biggest peak I've

151
0:07:12.55,000 --> 0:07:18,000
ever seen and I saw what's going on we

152
0:07:16.9,000 --> 0:07:21,000
stressed people out at MIT every way

153
0:07:18.82,000 --> 0:07:26,000
imaginable I've never seen a peak this

154
0:07:22.06,000 --> 0:07:28,000
big and it was only on one side how can

155
0:07:26.86,000 --> 0:07:3,000
you be stressed on one side your body

156
0:07:28.27,000 --> 0:07:32,000
not the other so I thought one or both

157
0:07:31.21,000 --> 0:07:34,000
sensors must be broken

158
0:07:32.41,000 --> 0:07:36,000
now I'm an electro engineer by training

159
0:07:34.6,000 --> 0:07:38,000
so I started a whole bunch of stuff to

160
0:07:36.7,000 --> 0:07:4,000
try to debug this and long story short I

161
0:07:38.83,000 --> 0:07:43,000
could not reproduce this so I resorted

162
0:07:41.68,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to old-fashioned debugging I called the

163
0:07:44.53,000 --> 0:07:5,000
student at home on vacation hi how's

164
0:07:49.36,000 --> 0:07:54,000
your little brother how's your Christmas

165
0:07:51.31,000 --> 0:07:56,000
hey do you have any idea what happened

166
0:07:54.67,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to him and I gave this particular date

167
0:07:56.41,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and time in the data and he said I don't

168
0:08:00.1,000 --> 0:08:06,000
know I'll check the diary diary MIT

169
0:08:03.73,000 --> 0:08:07,000
student keeps a diary so I waited and he

170
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:1,000
came back he had the exact date and time

171
0:08:08.65,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and he says that was right before he had

172
0:08:10.72,000 --> 0:08:17,000
a grand mal seizure now at the time I

173
0:08:15.79,000 --> 0:08:2,000
didn't know anything about epilepsy and

174
0:08:18.24,000 --> 0:08:22,000
did a bunch of research realized that

175
0:08:21.37,000 --> 0:08:23,000
another student's dad is chief of

176
0:08:23.05,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Neurosurgery at Children's Hospital

177
0:08:24.1,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Boston

178
0:08:24.99,000 --> 0:08:28,000
screwed up my courage and called dr. Joe

179
0:08:27.49,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Madsen hi dr. Madsen my name is Rosalind

180
0:08:29.8,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Picard is it possible somebody could

181
0:08:33.31,000 --> 0:08:4,000
have a huge sympathetic nervous system

182
0:08:37.87,000 --> 0:08:41,000
surge that's what drives the skin

183
0:08:40.36,000 --> 0:08:47,000
conductance twenty minutes before a

184
0:08:42.4,000 --> 0:08:49,000
seizure and he says probably not he says

185
0:08:48.31,000 --> 0:08:52,000
it's interesting we've had people whose

186
0:08:49.69,000 --> 0:08:53,000
hair stands on end on one arm 20 minutes

187
0:08:52.72,000 --> 0:08:55,000
before a seizure

188
0:08:54.3,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I'm like on one arm I didn't want to

189
0:08:56.65,000 --> 0:09:,000
tell him that initially because I

190
0:08:58.81,000 --> 0:09:01,000
thought he'd this was too ridiculous he

191
0:09:01.12,000 --> 0:09:03,000
explained how this

192
0:09:01.96,000 --> 0:09:04,000
happen in the brain and he got

193
0:09:03.76,000 --> 0:09:06,000
interested showed him the data we made a

194
0:09:05.8,000 --> 0:09:08,000
whole bunch more devices got them safety

195
0:09:07.09,000 --> 0:09:11,000
certified 90 families were being

196
0:09:09.22,000 --> 0:09:13,000
enrolled in a study all with children

197
0:09:11.86,000 --> 0:09:16,000
who were going to be monitored 24/7 with

198
0:09:13.81,000 --> 0:09:18,000
gold standard EEG on their scalp for

199
0:09:17.35,000 --> 0:09:21,000
reading the brain activity video to

200
0:09:19.06,000 --> 0:09:24,000
watch the behavior electrocardiogram ECG

201
0:09:21.76,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and now EDA electrodermal activity to

202
0:09:24.52,000 --> 0:09:27,000
see if there was something and this

203
0:09:26.38,000 --> 0:09:32,000
periphery that we could easily pick up

204
0:09:28.12,000 --> 0:09:36,000
related to a seizure we found in 100% of

205
0:09:33.25,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the first batch of grand mal seizures

206
0:09:36.19,000 --> 0:09:41,000
these whopper of responses in the skin

207
0:09:39.01,000 --> 0:09:43,000
conductance the blue in the middle the

208
0:09:41.68,000 --> 0:09:45,000
boys sleep is usually the biggest peak

209
0:09:43.57,000 --> 0:09:47,000
of the day these three seizures you see

210
0:09:45.73,000 --> 0:09:51,000
here are popping out of the forest like

211
0:09:48.22,000 --> 0:09:53,000
redwood trees furthermore when you

212
0:09:51.79,000 --> 0:09:58,000
couple the skin conductance at the top

213
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
with the movement from the wrist and you

214
0:09:59.08,000 --> 0:10:03,000
get lots of data and train machine

215
0:10:01.75,000 --> 0:10:06,000
learning and AI on it you can build an

216
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:1,000
automated AI that detects these patterns

217
0:10:07.24,000 --> 0:10:14,000
much better than just a shake detector

218
0:10:10.87,000 --> 0:10:17,000
can do so we realized that we needed to

219
0:10:15.07,000 --> 0:10:2,000
get this out and with the PhD work of

220
0:10:17.92,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Ming zur Po and later great improvements

221
0:10:20.95,000 --> 0:10:23,000
by an Pataca this has made progress and

222
0:10:23.08,000 --> 0:10:26,000
the seizure detection is much more

223
0:10:24.52,000 --> 0:10:28,000
accurate but we also learned some other

224
0:10:26.74,000 --> 0:10:31,000
things about sudha during this one thing

225
0:10:28.9,000 --> 0:10:33,000
we learned is that SUDEP is while it's

226
0:10:32.44,000 --> 0:10:36,000
rare after a generalized tonic-clonic

227
0:10:34.06,000 --> 0:10:38,000
seizure that's when it's most likely to

228
0:10:36.64,000 --> 0:10:39,000
happen after that type and when it

229
0:10:38.77,000 --> 0:10:41,000
happens it doesn't happen during the

230
0:10:40.3,000 --> 0:10:44,000
seizure and it doesn't usually happen in

231
0:10:42.58,000 --> 0:10:46,000
immediately afterwards but immediately

232
0:10:44.86,000 --> 0:10:48,000
afterwards when the person just seems

233
0:10:47.14,000 --> 0:10:52,000
very still in quiet

234
0:10:48.91,000 --> 0:10:54,000
they may go into another phase where the

235
0:10:52.81,000 --> 0:10:56,000
breathing stops and then after the

236
0:10:54.94,000 --> 0:10:58,000
breathing stops later the heart stops so

237
0:10:57.28,000 --> 0:11:02,000
there's some time to get somebody there

238
0:10:59.43,000 --> 0:11:04,000
we also learned that there is a region

239
0:11:03.01,000 --> 0:11:06,000
deep in the brain called the amygdala

240
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
which we had been studying in our

241
0:11:06.58,000 --> 0:11:08,000
emotion research a lot we have two

242
0:11:08.71,000 --> 0:11:1,000
amygdalas

243
0:11:09.22,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and if you stimulate the right one you

244
0:11:11.35,000 --> 0:11:15,000
get a big right skin conductance

245
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:17,000
response now you have two

246
0:11:15.55,000 --> 0:11:18,000
sign up right now for a craniotomy to

247
0:11:17.17,000 --> 0:11:21,000
get this done not exactly something

248
0:11:19.36,000 --> 0:11:22,000
we're gonna volunteer to do but it

249
0:11:21.34,000 --> 0:11:24,000
causes a big right skin conductance

250
0:11:22.69,000 --> 0:11:25,000
response stimulating the left one big

251
0:11:24.52,000 --> 0:11:29,000
left skin conductance response on the

252
0:11:26.14,000 --> 0:11:31,000
palm and furthermore when somebody

253
0:11:29.86,000 --> 0:11:32,000
stimulates your amygdala while you're

254
0:11:31.87,000 --> 0:11:35,000
sitting there and you might just be

255
0:11:32.98,000 --> 0:11:4,000
working you don't show any signs of

256
0:11:36.19,000 --> 0:11:42,000
distress but you stop breathing and you

257
0:11:41.23,000 --> 0:11:45,000
don't start again until somebody

258
0:11:42.51,000 --> 0:11:49,000
stimulates you hey Roz are you there and

259
0:11:46.12,000 --> 0:11:51,000
you open your mouth to talk as you take

260
0:11:49.54,000 --> 0:11:57,000
that breath to speak you start breathing

261
0:11:51.94,000 --> 0:11:58,000
again so we had started with work on

262
0:11:57.67,000 --> 0:12:,000
stress which had enabled us to build

263
0:11:59.83,000 --> 0:12:01,000
lots of sensors that were gathering high

264
0:12:01.57,000 --> 0:12:03,000
quality enough data that we could leave

265
0:12:02.71,000 --> 0:12:06,000
the lab and start to get this in the

266
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
wild accidentally found whopper of a

267
0:12:07.15,000 --> 0:12:1,000
response with a seizure neurological

268
0:12:09.07,000 --> 0:12:12,000
activation that can cause a much bigger

269
0:12:10.54,000 --> 0:12:13,000
response than traditional stressors lots

270
0:12:13.06,000 --> 0:12:16,000
of partnership with hospitals and

271
0:12:14.41,000 --> 0:12:17,000
epilepsy Monitoring Unit especially

272
0:12:16.6,000 --> 0:12:19,000
children's hospital boston and the

273
0:12:17.89,000 --> 0:12:22,000
brigham and machine learning in AI on

274
0:12:20.56,000 --> 0:12:25,000
top of this to take and collect lots

275
0:12:23.62,000 --> 0:12:27,000
more data in service of trying to

276
0:12:26.02,000 --> 0:12:3,000
understand these events and if we could

277
0:12:27.88,000 --> 0:12:33,000
prevent suit up this is now

278
0:12:30.73,000 --> 0:12:35,000
commercialized by impecca startup that

279
0:12:34.57,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I've had the privilege to co-found and

280
0:12:36.67,000 --> 0:12:4,000
the team there has done an amazing job

281
0:12:38.31,000 --> 0:12:43,000
improving the technology to make a very

282
0:12:41.35,000 --> 0:12:45,000
beautiful sensor that not only tells

283
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
time and does steps and sleep and all

284
0:12:45.73,000 --> 0:12:48,000
that good stuff but this is running

285
0:12:47.2,000 --> 0:12:51,000
real-time AI and machine learning to

286
0:12:49.69,000 --> 0:12:54,000
detect generalized tonic-clonic seizures

287
0:12:51.76,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and send an alert for help if I were to

288
0:12:54.91,000 --> 0:13:,000
have a seizure and lose consciousness

289
0:12:57.4,000 --> 0:13:05,000
this just got fda-approved as the first

290
0:13:01.12,000 --> 0:13:09,000
SmartWatch to get approved in Neurology

291
0:13:06.11,000 --> 0:13:09,000
[Music]

292
0:13:13.81,000 --> 0:13:18,000
now the next slide is what made my skin

293
0:13:16.82,000 --> 0:13:21,000
conductance got one morning I'm checking

294
0:13:19.67,000 --> 0:13:24,000
my email and I see a story from a mom

295
0:13:22.31,000 --> 0:13:26,000
who said she was in the shower and her

296
0:13:25.43,000 --> 0:13:28,000
phone was on the counter by the shower

297
0:13:27.02,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and it said her daughter might need her

298
0:13:28.94,000 --> 0:13:3,000
help

299
0:13:29.39,000 --> 0:13:32,000
so she interrupts her shower and goes

300
0:13:31.61,000 --> 0:13:34,000
running to her daughter's bedroom and

301
0:13:32.99,000 --> 0:13:37,000
she finds her daughter face down in bed

302
0:13:35.39,000 --> 0:13:4,000
blue and not breathing she flips her

303
0:13:38.27,000 --> 0:13:44,000
over human stimulation and her daughter

304
0:13:41.18,000 --> 0:13:48,000
takes a breath and another breath and

305
0:13:44.3,000 --> 0:13:52,000
her daughter turns pink and is fine I

306
0:13:48.82,000 --> 0:13:54,000
think I turned white this email my first

307
0:13:53.24,000 --> 0:13:56,000
response is oh no it's not perfect the

308
0:13:55.22,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Bluetooth could break the battery could

309
0:13:56.63,000 --> 0:13:59,000
die all these things could go wrong

310
0:13:57.95,000 --> 0:14:02,000
don't rely on this and she said it's

311
0:14:00.41,000 --> 0:14:04,000
okay I know no technology is perfect

312
0:14:02.96,000 --> 0:14:09,000
none of us can always be there all the

313
0:14:05.03,000 --> 0:14:13,000
time but this this device plus AI

314
0:14:10.66,000 --> 0:14:17,000
enabled me to get there in time to save

315
0:14:13.04,000 --> 0:14:21,000
my daughter's life now I've been

316
0:14:18.44,000 --> 0:14:23,000
mentioning children but sue Depp Peaks

317
0:14:21.35,000 --> 0:14:26,000
actually among people in their 20s 30s

318
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and 40s and the next line I'm going to

319
0:14:26.75,000 --> 0:14:29,000
put up is probably gonna make some

320
0:14:28.04,000 --> 0:14:33,000
people uncomfortable but it's less

321
0:14:30.59,000 --> 0:14:35,000
uncomfortable then we'll all be if this

322
0:14:33.05,000 --> 0:14:38,000
list is extended to somebody you know

323
0:14:35.71,000 --> 0:14:39,000
could this happen to somebody you know

324
0:14:38.51,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and the reason I bring up this

325
0:14:40.58,000 --> 0:14:45,000
uncomfortable question is because one in

326
0:14:43.34,000 --> 0:14:48,000
26 of you will have epilepsy at some

327
0:14:45.86,000 --> 0:14:5,000
point and from what I've been learning

328
0:14:48.83,000 --> 0:14:51,000
people with epilepsy often don't tell

329
0:14:50.99,000 --> 0:14:54,000
their friends and their neighbors that

330
0:14:52.28,000 --> 0:15:,000
they haven't so if you're willing to let

331
0:14:55.31,000 --> 0:15:03,000
them use an AI or whatever to summon you

332
0:15:00.8,000 --> 0:15:04,000
in a moment of possible need if you

333
0:15:03.44,000 --> 0:15:07,000
would let them know that you could make

334
0:15:05.21,000 --> 0:15:12,000
a difference in their life why do all

335
0:15:08.24,000 --> 0:15:14,000
this hard work to build a eyes a couple

336
0:15:12.41,000 --> 0:15:16,000
of reasons here one is Natasha the girl

337
0:15:14.9,000 --> 0:15:17,000
who lived and her family wanted me to

338
0:15:16.52,000 --> 0:15:2,000
tell you her name

339
0:15:18.31,000 --> 0:15:23,000
another is her family and the wonderful

340
0:15:21.35,000 --> 0:15:25,000
people out there who want to be there to

341
0:15:23.84,000 --> 0:15:25,000
support people who have conditions that

342
0:15:25.7,000 --> 0:15:26,000
they

343
0:15:26.13,000 --> 0:15:3,000
felt uncomfortable in the past

344
0:15:27.42,000 --> 0:15:32,000
mentioning to others and the other

345
0:15:30.3,000 --> 0:15:37,000
reason is all of you because we have the

346
0:15:33.36,000 --> 0:15:39,000
opportunity to shape the future of AI we

347
0:15:37.35,000 --> 0:15:42,000
can actually change it because we are

348
0:15:40.32,000 --> 0:15:46,000
the ones building it so let's build AI

349
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
that makes everybody's lives better

350
0:15:47.18,000 --> 0:15:53,000
thank you

351
0:15:48.67,000 --> 0:15:53,000

I think that at the time,

3
0:00:14.554,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Catwoman had a really cool pair of glasses

4
0:00:17.887,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in the Batman series that was on television.

5
0:00:20.929,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And I wanted to be cool like her.

6
0:00:23.012,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It didn't occur to me

7
0:00:24.304,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that glasses were really a medical device.

8
0:00:26.845,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Small Thing.)

9
0:00:28.525,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Big Idea.)

10
0:00:32.595,000 --> 0:00:34,000
When light rays reflect off an object

11
0:00:34.72,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and enter the eye through the cornea,

12
0:00:36.554,000 --> 0:00:39,000
your retina converts this light into electrical impulses

13
0:00:40.179,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that are sent to the brain,

14
0:00:41.845,000 --> 0:00:42,000
which interprets the impulses

15
0:00:43.637,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and allows you to understand what you're seeing.

16
0:00:46.762,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Eyeglasses help you see.

17
0:00:48.929,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The earliest forms of eye gear

18
0:00:50.887,000 --> 0:00:52,000
can be traced back 4,000 years.

19
0:00:53.762,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Cultures that needed to adapt to climates that were snowy

20
0:00:57.595,000 --> 0:00:58,000
created eye shields,

21
0:00:59.012,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and they were made of bone and animal hides.

22
0:01:02.429,000 --> 0:01:05,000
They had small slits for people to see through,

23
0:01:05.47,000 --> 0:01:06,000
but no lenses.

24
0:01:07.095,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The first vision aid was called a reading stone

25
0:01:09.72,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and was invented over 1,000 years ago.

26
0:01:12.679,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It's not exactly clear who invented the first eyeglasses,

27
0:01:17.387,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but many people attribute it to the Italians.

28
0:01:19.887,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Early versions of eyeglasses were called rivet spectacles.

29
0:01:23.804,000 --> 0:01:26,000
They were two magnifying glasses that were hinged together

30
0:01:27.47,000 --> 0:01:28,000
at the bridge of the nose.

31
0:01:28.804,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It took some time for eyeglasses to land

32
0:01:32.512,000 --> 0:01:33,000
on the perfect design.

33
0:01:34.095,000 --> 0:01:36,000
They didn't really have sides,

34
0:01:36.262,000 --> 0:01:39,000
which are also called temples, or arms,

35
0:01:39.47,000 --> 0:01:41,000
until about the 17th century.

36
0:01:41.637,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Modern-day eyeglasses feature a pair of rims

37
0:01:44.97,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that hold corrective lenses,

38
0:01:46.929,000 --> 0:01:48,000
a bridge that connects the rims,

39
0:01:49.387,000 --> 0:01:51,000
sides that slide behind the ears,

40
0:01:52.012,000 --> 0:01:54,000
hinges that connect the sides to the frames,

41
0:01:55.012,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and on some glasses, a pair of temple tips

42
0:01:58.262,000 --> 0:01:59,000
for behind the ear comfort.

43
0:02:00.22,000 --> 0:02:01,000
In American culture,

44
0:02:01.554,000 --> 0:02:04,000
20th century cinema helped popularize eyeglasses.

45
0:02:04.887,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Audiences would see glamorous actresses and actors

46
0:02:08.637,000 --> 0:02:1,000
donning glasses to take on a different persona.

47
0:02:11.637,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Sometimes a pair of glasses became popularized

48
0:02:14.137,000 --> 0:02:17,000
by the actual person that was wearing them,

49
0:02:17.345,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and then that personality trait

50
0:02:19.179,000 --> 0:02:22,000
was projected into the actual device.

51
0:02:22.262,000 --> 0:02:23,000
You had the aviator glasses,

52
0:02:23.887,000 --> 0:02:25,000
which showed a forward-thinking,

53
0:02:25.929,000 --> 0:02:27,000
adventurous type of person.

54
0:02:27.97,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Glasses with heavy frames signified intelligence

55
0:02:32.304,000 --> 0:02:33,000
or nerdiness.

56
0:02:33.887,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Wayfarers signified this kind of nerdy punk,

57
0:02:37.095,000 --> 0:02:38,000
the outlaw, the misfit.

58
0:02:38.595,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Glasses have become so popular as a fashion device

59
0:02:42.679,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that some people actually don glasses

60
0:02:45.554,000 --> 0:02:47,000
without a prescription lens at all,

61
0:02:47.804,000 --> 0:02:51,000
because they want to portray a certain attribute about themselves.

62
0:02:51.929,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Glasses are a lifeline to people.

63
0:02:54.137,000 --> 0:02:56,000
People that can't see well enough to drive,

64
0:02:57.137,000 --> 0:02:59,000
well enough to cook, well enough to read

65
0:02:59.887,000 --> 0:03:03,000
rely on glasses for maintaining their lives.

66
0:03:04.054,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And there's lots of other objects in our society

67
0:03:06.47,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that have been created

68
0:03:07.762,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to help overcome various physical obstacles.

69
0:03:11.22,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And it's only the eyeglasses

70
0:03:13.387,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that have catapulted to that fashion statement.

71
0:03:17.179,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Wouldn't it be wonderful if anything that we use,

72
0:03:20.637,000 --> 0:03:23,000
any device that we've invented to help our humanity

73
0:03:24.637,000 --> 0:03:26,000
could also be elevated in the same way?

74
0:03:27.012,000 --> 0:03:29,000

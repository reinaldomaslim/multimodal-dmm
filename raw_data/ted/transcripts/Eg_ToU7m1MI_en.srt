1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
A great way to start, I think, with my view of simplicity

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
is to take a look at TED. Here you are, understanding why we're here,

3
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
what's going on with no difficulty at all.

4
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
The best A.I. in the planet would find it complex and confusing,

5
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and my little dog Watson would find it simple and understandable

6
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but would miss the point.

7
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
He would have a great time.

9
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And of course, if you're a speaker here, like Hans Rosling,

10
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
a speaker finds this complex, tricky. But in Hans Rosling's case,

11
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
he had a secret weapon yesterday,

12
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
literally, in his sword swallowing act.

13
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And I must say, I thought of quite a few objects

14
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that I might try to swallow today and finally gave up on,

15
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but he just did it and that was a wonderful thing.

16
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So Puck meant not only are we fools in the pejorative sense,

17
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
but that we're easily fooled. In fact, what Shakespeare

18
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled,

19
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
so we're actually looking forward to it.

20
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We go to magic shows in order to be fooled.

21
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And this makes many things fun, but it makes it difficult to actually

22
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves.

23
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And our friend, Betty Edwards,

24
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" lady, shows these two tables

25
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to her drawing class and says,

26
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"The problem you have with learning to draw

27
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
is not that you can't move your hand,

28
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
but that the way your brain perceives images is faulty.

29
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It's trying to perceive images into objects

30
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
rather than seeing what's there."

31
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And to prove it, she says, "The exact size and shape of these tabletops

32
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
is the same, and I'm going to prove it to you."

33
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
She does this with cardboard, but since I have

34
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
an expensive computer here

35
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I'll just rotate this little guy around and ...

36
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Now having seen that -- and I've seen it hundreds of times,

37
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
because I use this in every talk I give -- I still can't see

38
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that they're the same size and shape, and I doubt that you can either.

39
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So what do artists do? Well, what artists do is to measure.

40
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
They measure very, very carefully.

41
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And if you measure very, very carefully with a stiff arm and a straight edge,

42
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
you'll see that those two shapes are

43
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
exactly the same size.

44
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And the Talmud saw this a long time ago, saying,

45
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
"We see things not as they are, but as we are."

46
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I certainly would like to know what happened to the person

47
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
who had that insight back then,

48
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion.

49
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are,

50
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination

51
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
happening inside here. It's a waking dream,

52
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and understanding that that is what we actually exist in

53
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history.

54
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And what that means: "simple and understandable"

55
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
might not be actually simple or understandable,

56
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and things we think are "complex" might be made simple and understandable.

57
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws.

58
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel.

59
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The way I think of it is, we can't learn to see

60
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
until we admit we're blind.

61
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Once you start down at this very humble level,

62
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
then you can start finding ways to see things.

63
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And what's happened, over the last 400 years in particular,

64
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
is that human beings have invented "brainlets" --

65
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
little additional parts for our brain --

66
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
made out of powerful ideas that help us

67
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
see the world in different ways.

68
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And these are in the form of sensory apparatus --

69
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
telescopes, microscopes -- reasoning apparatus --

70
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
various ways of thinking -- and, most importantly,

71
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
in the ability to change perspective on things.

72
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I'll talk about that a little bit.

73
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It's this change in perspective

74
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
on what it is we think we're perceiving

75
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that has helped us make more progress in the last 400 years

76
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
than we have in the rest of human history.

77
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And yet, it is not taught in any K through 12 curriculum in America that I'm aware of.

78
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So one of the things that goes from simple to complex

79
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
is when we do more. We like more.

80
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
If we do more in a kind of a stupid way,

81
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
the simplicity gets complex

82
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and, in fact, we can keep on doing it for a very long time.

83
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But Murray Gell-Mann yesterday talked about emergent properties;

84
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
another name for them could be "architecture"

85
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
as a metaphor for taking the same old material

86
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and thinking about non-obvious, non-simple ways of combining it.

87
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And in fact, what Murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature --

88
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
of having the descriptions

89
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
at various levels be rather similar --

90
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles

91
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
are both sticky and standoffish,

92
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and they're in violent motion.

93
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Those three things give rise to all the different levels

94
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
of what seem to be complexity in our world.

95
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But how simple?

96
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So, when I saw Roslings' Gapminder stuff a few years ago,

97
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I just thought it was the greatest thing I'd seen

98
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
in conveying complex ideas simply.

99
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But then I had a thought of, "Boy, maybe it's too simple."

100
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And I put some effort in to try and check

101
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time

102
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side,

103
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and I found that they matched up very well.

104
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So the Roslings have been able to do simplicity

105
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
without removing what's important about the data.

106
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Whereas the film yesterday that we saw

107
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
of the simulation of the inside of a cell,

108
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
as a former molecular biologist, I didn't like that at all.

109
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Not because it wasn't beautiful or anything,

110
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand

111
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
about molecular biology, and that is:

112
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes

113
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
finding each other just the right way

114
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
so they combine together and be catalyzed?

115
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And what we saw yesterday was

116
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
every reaction was fortuitous;

117
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
they just swooped in the air and bound, and something happened.

118
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But in fact, those molecules are spinning at the rate of

119
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
about a million revolutions per second;

120
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
they're agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds;

121
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
they're completely crowded together, they're jammed,

122
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
they're bashing up against each other.

123
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And if you don't understand that in your mental model of this stuff,

124
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous,

125
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and I think that's exactly the wrong image

126
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
for when you're trying to teach science.

127
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So, another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication

128
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
with the actual understanding of some principle.

129
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So a kid who's 14 in high school

130
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
gets this version of the Pythagorean theorem,

131
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
which is a truly subtle and interesting proof,

132
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but in fact it's not a good way to start learning about mathematics.

133
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So a more direct one, one that gives you more of the feeling of math,

134
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
is something closer to Pythagoras' own proof, which goes like this:

135
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
so here we have this triangle, and if we surround that C square with

136
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
three more triangles and we copy that,

137
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
notice that we can move those triangles down like this.

138
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ...

139
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and bingo. That is all you have to do.

140
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And this kind of proof is the kind of proof

141
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that you need to learn when you're learning mathematics

142
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in order to get an idea of what it means

143
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
before you look into the, literally, 1,200 or 1,500 proofs

144
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
of Pythagoras' theorem that have been discovered.

145
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Now let's go to young children.

146
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
This is a very unusual teacher

147
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
who was a kindergarten and first-grade teacher,

148
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
but was a natural mathematician.

149
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music

150
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
but is a terrific musician;

151
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
she just had a feeling for math.

152
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
And here are her six-year-olds,

153
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and she's got them making shapes out of a shape.

154
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So they pick a shape they like -- like a diamond, or a square,

155
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
or a triangle, or a trapezoid -- and then they try and make

156
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
the next larger shape of that same shape, and the next larger shape.

157
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
You can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there.

158
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And what this teacher did on every project

159
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project,

160
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and then something like science.

161
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So they had created these artifacts.

162
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Now she had them look at them and do this ... laborious,

163
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
which I thought for a long time, until she explained to me was

164
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
to slow them down so they'll think.

165
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So they're cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here

166
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and pasting them up.

167
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But the whole point of this thing is

168
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
for them to look at this chart and fill it out.

169
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
"What have you noticed about what you did?"

170
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And so six-year-old Lauren there noticed that the first one took one,

171
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and the second one took three more

172
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and the total was four on that one,

173
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
the third one took five more and the total was nine on that one,

174
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and then the next one.

175
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
She saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add

176
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
around the edges was always going to grow by two,

177
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there.

178
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six,

179
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
where she wasn't sure what six times six was

180
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and what seven times seven was,

181
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
but then she was confident again.

182
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
So that's what Lauren did.

183
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And then the teacher, Gillian Ishijima, had the kids

184
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor,

185
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and everybody went batshit: "Holy shit! They're the same!"

186
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
No matter what the shapes were, the growth law is the same.

187
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd

188
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
will recognize these two progressions

189
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
as a first-order discrete differential equation

190
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and a second-order discrete differential equation,

191
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
derived by six-year-olds.

192
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Well, that's pretty amazing.

193
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
That isn't what we usually try to teach six-year-olds.

194
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So, let's take a look now at how we might use the computer for some of this.

195
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And so the first idea here is

196
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
just to show you the kind of things that children do.

197
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I'm using the software that we're putting on the $100 laptop.

198
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So I'd like to draw a little car here --

199
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I'll just do this very quickly -- and put a big tire on him.

200
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And I get a little object here and I can look inside this object,

201
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I'll call it a car. And here's a little behavior: car forward.

202
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Each time I click it, car turn.

203
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
If I want to make a little script to do this over and over again,

204
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I just drag these guys out and set them going.

205
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And I can try steering the car here by ...

206
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
See the car turn by five here?

207
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
So what if I click this down to zero?

208
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
It goes straight. That's a big revelation for nine-year-olds.

209
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Make it go in the other direction.

210
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
But of course, that's a little bit like kissing your sister

211
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
as far as driving a car,

212
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
so the kids want to do a steering wheel;

213
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
so they draw a steering wheel.

214
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And we'll call this a wheel.

215
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
See this wheel's heading here?

216
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
If I turn this wheel, you can see that number over there going minus and positive.

217
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
That's kind of an invitation to pick up this name of

218
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
those numbers coming out there

219
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and to just drop it into the script here,

220
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and now I can steer the car with the steering wheel.

221
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And it's interesting.

222
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
You know how much trouble the children have with variables,

223
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
but by learning it this way, in a situated fashion,

224
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
they never forget from this single trial

225
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
what a variable is and how to use it.

226
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did.

227
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
So if you look at the little script here,

228
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
the speed is always going to be 30.

229
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
We're going to move the car according to that over and over again.

230
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And I'm dropping a little dot for each one of these things;

231
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
they're evenly spaced because they're 30 apart.

232
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And what if I do this progression that the six-year-olds did

233
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
of saying, "OK, I'm going to increase the speed by two each time,

234
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and then I'm going to increase the distance by the speed each time?

235
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
What do I get there?"

236
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
We get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration.

237
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
So how do the children do science?

238
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
(Video) Teacher: [Choose] objects that you think will fall to the Earth at the same time.

239
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Student 1: Ooh, this is nice.

240
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Teacher: Do not pay any attention

241
0:15:20.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
to what anybody else is doing.

242
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Who's got the apple?

243
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Alan Kay: They've got little stopwatches.

244
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Student 2: What did you get? What did you get?

245
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
AK: Stopwatches aren't accurate enough.

246
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Student 3: 0.99 seconds.

247
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Teacher: So put "sponge ball" ...

248
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Student 4l: [I decided to] do the shot put and the sponge ball

249
0:15:59.33,000 --> 0:16:02,000
because they're two totally different weights,

250
0:16:02.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and if you drop them at the same time,

251
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:06,000
maybe they'll drop at the same speed.

252
0:16:06.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Teacher: Drop. Class: Whoa!

253
0:16:10.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
AK: So obviously, Aristotle never asked a child

254
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
about this particular point

255
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:18,000
because, of course, he didn't bother doing the experiment,

256
0:16:18.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and neither did St. Thomas Aquinas.

257
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And it was not until Galileo actually did it

258
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:25,000
that an adult thought like a child,

259
0:16:25.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
only 400 years ago.

260
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:32,000
We get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids

261
0:16:32.33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
who will actually cut straight to the chase.

262
0:16:35.33,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Now, what if we want to look at this more closely?

263
0:16:38.33,000 --> 0:16:41,000
We can take a movie of what's going on,

264
0:16:41.33,000 --> 0:16:43,000
but even if we single stepped this movie,

265
0:16:43.33,000 --> 0:16:45,000
it's tricky to see what's going on.

266
0:16:45.33,000 --> 0:16:48,000
And so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side

267
0:16:48.33,000 --> 0:16:5,000
or stack them up.

268
0:16:50.33,000 --> 0:16:55,000
So when the children see this, they say, "Ah! Acceleration,"

269
0:16:55.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways,

270
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is.

271
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:1,000
So what I'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image

272
0:17:10.33,000 --> 0:17:15,000
to the bottom of the next image, about a fifth of a second later,

273
0:17:15.33,000 --> 0:17:17,000
like that. And they're getting faster and faster each time,

274
0:17:17.33,000 --> 0:17:27,000
and if I stack these guys up, then we see the differences; the increase

275
0:17:27.33,000 --> 0:17:3,000
in the speed is constant.

276
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:32,000
And they say, "Oh, yeah. Constant acceleration.

277
0:17:32.33,000 --> 0:17:34,000
We've done that already."

278
0:17:34.33,000 --> 0:17:42,000
And how shall we look and verify that we actually have it?

279
0:17:42.33,000 --> 0:17:47,000
So you can't tell much from just making the ball drop there,

280
0:17:47.33,000 --> 0:17:51,000
but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time,

281
0:17:53.33,000 --> 0:17:58,000
we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model.

282
0:18:00.33,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Galileo, by the way, did this very cleverly

283
0:18:04.33,000 --> 0:18:07,000
by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute.

284
0:18:07.33,000 --> 0:18:12,000
I pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that

285
0:18:12.33,000 --> 0:18:17,000
this is actually probably a Newton and the apple type story,

286
0:18:17.33,000 --> 0:18:19,000
but it's a great story.

287
0:18:19.33,000 --> 0:18:21,000
And I thought I would do just one thing

288
0:18:21.33,000 --> 0:18:31,000
on the $100 laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here.

289
0:18:31.33,000 --> 0:18:34,000
So once you have gravity, here's this --

290
0:18:34.33,000 --> 0:18:36,000
increase the speed by something,

291
0:18:36.33,000 --> 0:18:39,000
increase the ship's speed.

292
0:18:39.33,000 --> 0:18:42,000
If I start the little game here that the kids have done,

293
0:18:42.33,000 --> 0:18:44,000
it'll crash the space ship.

294
0:18:44.33,000 --> 0:18:48,000
But if I oppose gravity, here we go ... Oops!

295
0:18:48.33,000 --> 0:18:5,000
(Laughter)

296
0:18:50.33,000 --> 0:18:51,000
One more.

297
0:18:54.33,000 --> 0:18:59,000
Yeah, there we go. Yeah, OK?

298
0:18:59.33,000 --> 0:19:06,000
I guess the best way to end this is with two quotes:

299
0:19:06.33,000 --> 0:19:08,000
Marshall McLuhan said,

300
0:19:08.33,000 --> 0:19:12,000
"Children are the messages that we send to the future,"

301
0:19:12.33,000 --> 0:19:14,000
but in fact, if you think of it,

302
0:19:14.33,000 --> 0:19:16,000
children are the future we send to the future.

303
0:19:16.33,000 --> 0:19:19,000
Forget about messages;

304
0:19:19.33,000 --> 0:19:22,000
children are the future,

305
0:19:22.33,000 --> 0:19:24,000
and children in the first and second world

306
0:19:24.33,000 --> 0:19:27,000
and, most especially, in the third world

307
0:19:27.33,000 --> 0:19:29,000
need mentors.

308
0:19:29.33,000 --> 0:19:34,000
And this summer, we're going to build five million of these $100 laptops,

309
0:19:34.33,000 --> 0:19:36,000
and maybe 50 million next year.

310
0:19:36.33,000 --> 0:19:43,000
But we couldn't create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life.

311
0:19:43.33,000 --> 0:19:49,000
That means that we, once again, have a thing where we can put technology out,

312
0:19:49.33,000 --> 0:19:52,000
but the mentoring that is required to go

313
0:19:52.33,000 --> 0:19:57,000
from a simple new iChat instant messaging system

314
0:19:57.33,000 --> 0:19:59,000
to something with depth is missing.

315
0:19:59.33,000 --> 0:20:02,000
I believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface,

316
0:20:02.33,000 --> 0:20:06,000
and this new kind of user interface could be done

317
0:20:06.33,000 --> 0:20:11,000
with an expenditure of about 100 million dollars.

318
0:20:11.33,000 --> 0:20:18,000
It sounds like a lot, but it is literally 18 minutes of what we're spending in Iraq --

319
0:20:18.33,000 --> 0:20:23,000
we're spending 8 billion dollars a month; 18 minutes is 100 million dollars --

320
0:20:23.33,000 --> 0:20:25,000
so this is actually cheap.

321
0:20:25.33,000 --> 0:20:29,000
And Einstein said,

322
0:20:29.33,000 --> 0:20:32,000
"Things should be as simple as possible, but not simpler."

323
0:20:32.33,000 --> 0:20:33,000
Thank you.

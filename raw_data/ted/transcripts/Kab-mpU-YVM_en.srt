1
0:00:12.841,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Last year, some BuzzFeed employees were scheming

2
0:00:16.434,000 --> 0:00:18,000
to prank their boss, Ze Frank,

3
0:00:19.415,000 --> 0:00:2,000
on his birthday.

4
0:00:21.319,000 --> 0:00:25,000
They decided to put a family of baby goats in his office.

5
0:00:25.547,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:26.976,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Now, BuzzFeed had recently signed on to the Facebook Live experiment,

7
0:00:31.421,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and so naturally,

8
0:00:32.816,000 --> 0:00:35,000
we decided to livestream the whole event on the internet

9
0:00:36.722,000 --> 0:00:39,000
to capture the moment when Ze would walk in

10
0:00:40.046,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and discover livestock in his office.

11
0:00:44.019,000 --> 0:00:47,000
We thought the whole thing would last maybe 10 minutes,

12
0:00:47.207,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and a few hundred company employees would log in for the inside joke.

13
0:00:52.132,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But what happened?

14
0:00:53.977,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Ze kept on getting delayed:

15
0:00:55.719,000 --> 0:00:56,000
he went to get a drink,

16
0:00:57.229,000 --> 0:00:58,000
he was called to a meeting,

17
0:00:58.701,000 --> 0:00:59,000
the meeting ran long,

18
0:01:00.468,000 --> 0:01:01,000
he went to the bathroom.

19
0:01:01.657,000 --> 0:01:05,000
More and more people started logging in to watch the goats.

20
0:01:06.493,000 --> 0:01:1,000
By the time Ze walked in more than 30 minutes later,

21
0:01:10.53,000 --> 0:01:15,000
90,000 viewers were watching the livestream.

22
0:01:16.601,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Now, our team had a lot of discussion about this video

23
0:01:20.582,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and why it was so successful.

24
0:01:22.582,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It wasn't the biggest live video that we had done to date.

25
0:01:25.482,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The biggest one that we had done involved a fountain of cheese.

26
0:01:30.063,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But it performed so much better than we had expected.

27
0:01:33.912,000 --> 0:01:37,000
What was it about the goats in the office that we didn't anticipate?

28
0:01:38.781,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Now, a reasonable person could have any number of hypotheses.

29
0:01:42.863,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Maybe people love baby animals.

30
0:01:45.751,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Maybe people love office pranks.

31
0:01:47.499,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Maybe people love stories about their bosses

32
0:01:50.268,000 --> 0:01:51,000
or birthday surprises.

33
0:01:52.382,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But our team wasn't really thinking about what the video was about.

34
0:01:56.106,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We were thinking about

35
0:01:57.402,000 --> 0:02:01,000
what the people watching the video were thinking and feeling.

36
0:02:01.502,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We read some of the 82,000 comments that were made during the video,

37
0:02:06.309,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and we hypothesized that they were excited

38
0:02:10.125,000 --> 0:02:13,000
because they were participating in the shared anticipation

39
0:02:13.323,000 --> 0:02:15,000
of something that was about to happen.

40
0:02:16.077,000 --> 0:02:19,000
They were part of a community, just for an instant,

41
0:02:19.313,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and it made them happy.

42
0:02:21.102,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So we decided that we needed to test this hypothesis.

43
0:02:24.793,000 --> 0:02:27,000
What could we do to test this very same thing?

44
0:02:28.995,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The following week,

45
0:02:30.41,000 --> 0:02:34,000
armed with the additional knowledge that food videos are very popular,

46
0:02:35.109,000 --> 0:02:38,000
we dressed two people in hazmat suits

47
0:02:38.704,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and wrapped rubber bands around a watermelon until it exploded.

48
0:02:42.989,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:44.889,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Eight hundred thousand people watched

50
0:02:48.285,000 --> 0:02:52,000
the 690th rubber band explode the watermelon,

51
0:02:52.34,000 --> 0:02:55,000
marking it as the biggest Facebook Live event to date.

52
0:02:56.483,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The question I get most frequently is:

53
0:02:59.117,000 --> 0:03:,000
How do you make something go viral?

54
0:03:01.713,000 --> 0:03:03,000
The question itself is misplaced;

55
0:03:03.943,000 --> 0:03:04,000
it's not about the something.

56
0:03:05.66,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It's about what the people doing the something,

57
0:03:08.981,000 --> 0:03:09,000
reading or watching --

58
0:03:10.208,000 --> 0:03:11,000
what are they thinking?

59
0:03:11.841,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Now, most media companies, when they think about metadata,

60
0:03:15.211,000 --> 0:03:17,000
they think about subjects or formats.

61
0:03:18.412,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It's about goats,

62
0:03:19.586,000 --> 0:03:2,000
it's about office pranks,

63
0:03:21.386,000 --> 0:03:22,000
it's about food,

64
0:03:22.707,000 --> 0:03:23,000
it's a list or a video or a quiz,

65
0:03:24.585,000 --> 0:03:25,000
it's 2,000 words long,

66
0:03:25.868,000 --> 0:03:26,000
it's 15 minutes long,

67
0:03:27.045,000 --> 0:03:3,000
it has 23 embedded tweets or 15 images.

68
0:03:30.191,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Now, that kind of metadata is mildly interesting,

69
0:03:33.227,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but it doesn't actually get at what really matters.

70
0:03:36.217,000 --> 0:03:4,000
What if, instead of tagging what articles or videos are about,

71
0:03:40.399,000 --> 0:03:41,000
what if we asked:

72
0:03:41.613,000 --> 0:03:44,000
How is it helping our users do a real job in their lives?

73
0:03:46.173,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Last year, we started a project

74
0:03:49.017,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to formally categorize our content in this way.

75
0:03:51.973,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We called it, "cultural cartography."

76
0:03:55.72,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It formalized an informal practice that we've had for a really long time:

77
0:03:59.746,000 --> 0:04:01,000
don't just think about the subject matter;

78
0:04:01.996,000 --> 0:04:04,000
think also about, and in fact, primarily about,

79
0:04:05.188,000 --> 0:04:08,000
the job that your content is doing for the reader or the viewer.

80
0:04:09.45,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Let me show you the map that we have today.

81
0:04:11.98,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Each bubble is a specific job,

82
0:04:14.846,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and each group of bubbles in a specific color are related jobs.

83
0:04:19.64,000 --> 0:04:2,000
First up: humor.

84
0:04:21.918,000 --> 0:04:22,000
"Makes me laugh."

85
0:04:23.103,000 --> 0:04:25,000
There are so many ways to make somebody laugh.

86
0:04:25.915,000 --> 0:04:26,000
You can be laughing at someone,

87
0:04:27.456,000 --> 0:04:29,000
you could laugh at specific internet humor,

88
0:04:29.635,000 --> 0:04:32,000
you could be laughing at some good, clean, inoffensive dad jokes.

89
0:04:33.706,000 --> 0:04:35,000
"This is me." Identity.

90
0:04:36.03,000 --> 0:04:39,000
People are increasingly using media to explain, "This is who I am.

91
0:04:39.862,000 --> 0:04:41,000
This is my upbringing, this is my culture,

92
0:04:42.085,000 --> 0:04:44,000
this is my fandom, this is my guilty pleasure,

93
0:04:44.447,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and this is how I laugh about myself."

94
0:04:48.6,000 --> 0:04:49,000
"Helps me connect with another person."

95
0:04:50.506,000 --> 0:04:52,000
This is one of the greatest gifts of the internet.

96
0:04:52.941,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It's amazing when you find a piece of media

97
0:04:55.156,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that precisely describes your bond with someone.

98
0:04:59.02,000 --> 0:05:01,000
This is the group of jobs that helps me do something --

99
0:05:01.642,000 --> 0:05:02,000
helps me settle an argument,

100
0:05:03.043,000 --> 0:05:05,000
helps me learn something about myself or another person,

101
0:05:05.74,000 --> 0:05:06,000
or helps me explain my story.

102
0:05:07.62,000 --> 0:05:09,000
This is the group of jobs that makes me feel something --

103
0:05:10.333,000 --> 0:05:13,000
makes me curious or sad or restores my faith in humanity.

104
0:05:13.514,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Many media companies and creators do put themselves

105
0:05:17.257,000 --> 0:05:18,000
in their audiences' shoes.

106
0:05:18.749,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But in the age of social media, we can go much farther.

107
0:05:22.056,000 --> 0:05:26,000
People are connected to each other on Facebook, on Twitter,

108
0:05:26.142,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and they're increasingly using media to have a conversation

109
0:05:30.429,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and to talk to each other.

110
0:05:31.907,000 --> 0:05:36,000
If we can be a part of establishing a deeper connection between two people,

111
0:05:37.767,000 --> 0:05:4,000
then we will have done a real job for these people.

112
0:05:41.394,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Let me give you some examples of how this plays out.

113
0:05:44.578,000 --> 0:05:45,000
This is one of my favorite lists:

114
0:05:46.493,000 --> 0:05:49,000
"32 Memes You Should Send Your Sister Immediately" --

115
0:05:49.82,000 --> 0:05:5,000
immediately.

116
0:05:51.583,000 --> 0:05:54,000
For example, "When you're going through your sister's stuff,

117
0:05:54.711,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and you hear her coming up the stairs."

118
0:05:56.714,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Absolutely, I've done that.

119
0:05:58.528,000 --> 0:06:01,000
"Watching your sister get in trouble for something that you did

120
0:06:01.707,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and blamed on her."

121
0:06:02.923,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Yes, I've done that as well.

122
0:06:04.555,000 --> 0:06:05,000
This list got three million views.

123
0:06:06.378,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Why is that?

124
0:06:07.567,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Because it did, very well, several jobs:

125
0:06:10.567,000 --> 0:06:11,000
"This is us."

126
0:06:12.111,000 --> 0:06:13,000
"Connect with family."

127
0:06:13.4,000 --> 0:06:14,000
"Makes me laugh."

128
0:06:14.605,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Here are some of the thousands and thousands of comments

129
0:06:17.763,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that sisters sent to each other using this list.

130
0:06:21.508,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Sometimes we discover what jobs do after the fact.

131
0:06:25.592,000 --> 0:06:3,000
This quiz, "Pick an Outfit and We'll Guess Your Exact Age and Height,"

132
0:06:30.754,000 --> 0:06:32,000
went very viral: 10 million views.

133
0:06:32.841,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Ten million views.

134
0:06:34.041,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I mean -- did we actually determine the exact age and height

135
0:06:38.591,000 --> 0:06:39,000
of 10 million people?

136
0:06:40.199,000 --> 0:06:42,000
That's incredible. It's incredible.

137
0:06:42.485,000 --> 0:06:43,000
In fact, we didn't.

138
0:06:43.753,000 --> 0:06:44,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:44.906,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Turns out that this quiz went extremely viral

140
0:06:49.023,000 --> 0:06:52,000
among a group of 55-and-up women --

141
0:06:52.61,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Laughter)

142
0:06:53.806,000 --> 0:06:56,000
who were surprised and delighted

143
0:06:57.479,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that BuzzFeed determined that they were 28 and 5'9".

144
0:07:03.221,000 --> 0:07:04,000
(Laughter)

145
0:07:04.855,000 --> 0:07:07,000
"They put me at 34 years younger and seven inches taller.

146
0:07:08.087,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I dress for comfort and do not give a damn what anyone says.

147
0:07:11.059,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Age is a state of mind."

148
0:07:12.862,000 --> 0:07:15,000
This quiz was successful not because it was accurate,

149
0:07:15.936,000 --> 0:07:19,000
but because it allowed these ladies to do a very important job --

150
0:07:20.014,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the humblebrag.

151
0:07:22.478,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Now, we can even apply this framework to recipes and food.

152
0:07:27.887,000 --> 0:07:32,000
A recipe's normal job is to tell you what to make for dinner or for lunch.

153
0:07:34.205,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And this is how you would normally brainstorm for a recipe:

154
0:07:37.637,000 --> 0:07:39,000
you figure out what ingredients you want to use,

155
0:07:39.984,000 --> 0:07:4,000
what recipe that makes,

156
0:07:41.176,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and then maybe you slap a job on at the end to sell it.

157
0:07:44.445,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But what if we flipped it around and thought about the job first?

158
0:07:49.73,000 --> 0:07:53,000
One brainstorming session involved the job of bonding.

159
0:07:54.976,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So, could we make a recipe that brought people together?

160
0:07:59.3,000 --> 0:08:03,000
This is not a normal brainstorming process at a food publisher.

161
0:08:05.532,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So we know that people like to bake together,

162
0:08:08.271,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and we know that people like to do challenges together,

163
0:08:11.58,000 --> 0:08:15,000
so we decided to come up with a recipe that involved those two things,

164
0:08:16.337,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and we challenged ourselves:

165
0:08:18.272,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Could we get people to say,

166
0:08:20.102,000 --> 0:08:24,000
"Hey, BFF, let's see if we can do this together"?

167
0:08:24.807,000 --> 0:08:27,000
The resulting video was the "Fudgiest Brownies Ever" video.

168
0:08:28.166,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It was enormously successful in every metric possible --

169
0:08:31.114,000 --> 0:08:32,000
70 million views.

170
0:08:32.935,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And people said the exact things that we were going after:

171
0:08:36.659,000 --> 0:08:39,000
"Hey, Colette, we need to make these, are you up for a challenge?"

172
0:08:39.783,000 --> 0:08:4,000
"Game on."

173
0:08:40.96,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It did the job that it set out to do,

174
0:08:43.254,000 --> 0:08:47,000
which was to bring people together over baking and chocolate.

175
0:08:49.294,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I'm really excited about the potential for this project.

176
0:08:53.242,000 --> 0:08:56,000
When we talk about this framework with our content creators,

177
0:08:56.408,000 --> 0:08:57,000
they instantly get it,

178
0:08:57.597,000 --> 0:08:59,000
no matter what beat they cover, what country they’re in,

179
0:09:00.354,000 --> 0:09:01,000
or what language they speak.

180
0:09:01.743,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So cultural cartography has helped us massively scale our workforce training.

181
0:09:06.621,000 --> 0:09:09,000
When we talk about this project and this framework

182
0:09:10.295,000 --> 0:09:11,000
with advertisers and brands,

183
0:09:11.691,000 --> 0:09:12,000
they also instantly get it,

184
0:09:13.293,000 --> 0:09:18,000
because advertisers, more often than media companies,

185
0:09:18.943,000 --> 0:09:21,000
understand how important it is to understand the job

186
0:09:22.489,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that their products are doing for customers.

187
0:09:26.58,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But the reason I'm the most excited about this project

188
0:09:30.347,000 --> 0:09:33,000
is because it changes the relationship between media and data.

189
0:09:35.051,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Most media companies think of media as "mine."

190
0:09:39.547,000 --> 0:09:4,000
How many fans do I have?

191
0:09:40.778,000 --> 0:09:41,000
How many followers have I gained?

192
0:09:42.399,000 --> 0:09:43,000
How many views have I gotten?

193
0:09:44.13,000 --> 0:09:46,000
How many unique IDs do I have in my data warehouse?

194
0:09:47.372,000 --> 0:09:5,000
But that misses the true value of data, which is that it's yours.

195
0:09:53.166,000 --> 0:09:59,000
If we can capture in data what really matters to you,

196
0:09:59.288,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and if we can understand more the role that our work plays

197
0:10:03.8,000 --> 0:10:04,000
in your actual life,

198
0:10:05.213,000 --> 0:10:07,000
the better content we can create for you,

199
0:10:08.1,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and the better that we can reach you.

200
0:10:10.76,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Who are you?

201
0:10:13.293,000 --> 0:10:14,000
How did you get there?

202
0:10:14.897,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Where are you going?

203
0:10:16.13,000 --> 0:10:17,000
What do you care about?

204
0:10:17.423,000 --> 0:10:18,000
What can you teach us?

205
0:10:19.151,000 --> 0:10:2,000
That's cultural cartography.

206
0:10:21.146,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Thank you.

207
0:10:22.326,000 --> 0:10:25,000

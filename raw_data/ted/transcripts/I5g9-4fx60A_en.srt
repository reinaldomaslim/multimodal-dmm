1
0:00:13.111,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Chris Anderson: So, you've been obsessed with this problem

2
0:00:15.993,000 --> 0:00:16,000
for the last few years.

3
0:00:17.781,000 --> 0:00:19,000
What is the problem, in your own words?

4
0:00:19.845,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Andrew Forrest: Plastic.

5
0:00:21.6,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Simple as that.

6
0:00:23.312,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Our inability to use it for the tremendous energetic commodity that it is,

7
0:00:30.329,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and just throw it away.

8
0:00:32.838,000 --> 0:00:35,000
CA: And so we see waste everywhere.

9
0:00:35.933,000 --> 0:00:37,000
At its extreme, it looks a bit like this.

10
0:00:38.421,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I mean, where was this picture taken?

11
0:00:40.776,000 --> 0:00:41,000
AF: That's in the Philippines,

12
0:00:42.25,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and you know, there's a lot of rivers, ladies and gentlemen,

13
0:00:45.18,000 --> 0:00:46,000
which look exactly like that.

14
0:00:46.561,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And that's the Philippines.

15
0:00:47.919,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So it's all over Southeast Asia.

16
0:00:49.688,000 --> 0:00:5,000
CA: So plastic is thrown into the rivers,

17
0:00:51.693,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and from there, of course, it ends up in the ocean.

18
0:00:54.994,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I mean, we obviously see it on the beaches,

19
0:00:58.591,000 --> 0:01:,000
but that's not even your main concern.

20
0:01:01.157,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It's what's actually happening to it in the oceans. Talk about that.

21
0:01:04.648,000 --> 0:01:06,000
AF: OK, so look. Thank you, Chris.

22
0:01:07.173,000 --> 0:01:08,000
About four years ago,

23
0:01:08.371,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I thought I'd do something really barking crazy,

24
0:01:11.714,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and I committed to do a PhD in marine ecology.

25
0:01:16.446,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And the scary part about that was,

26
0:01:19.687,000 --> 0:01:2,000
sure, I learned a lot about marine life,

27
0:01:21.628,000 --> 0:01:23,000
but it taught me more about marine death

28
0:01:23.872,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and the extreme mass ecological fatality of fish,

29
0:01:30.056,000 --> 0:01:32,000
of marine life, marine mammals,

30
0:01:32.336,000 --> 0:01:34,000
very close biology to us,

31
0:01:34.824,000 --> 0:01:38,000
which are dying in the millions if not trillions that we can't count

32
0:01:39.086,000 --> 0:01:4,000
at the hands of plastic.

33
0:01:40.786,000 --> 0:01:43,000
CA: But people think of plastic as ugly but stable. Right?

34
0:01:44.652,000 --> 0:01:47,000
You throw something in the ocean, "Hey, it'll just sit there forever.

35
0:01:48.115,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Can't do any damage, right?"

36
0:01:49.785,000 --> 0:01:55,000
AF: See, Chris, it's an incredible substance designed for the economy.

37
0:01:56.576,000 --> 0:02:,000
It is the worst substance possible for the environment.

38
0:02:01.296,000 --> 0:02:04,000
The worst thing about plastics, as soon as it hits the environment,

39
0:02:04.507,000 --> 0:02:06,000
is that it fragments.

40
0:02:07.315,000 --> 0:02:09,000
It never stops being plastic.

41
0:02:09.782,000 --> 0:02:11,000
It breaks down smaller and smaller and smaller,

42
0:02:12.501,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and the breaking science on this, Chris,

43
0:02:15.173,000 --> 0:02:17,000
which we've known in marine ecology for a few years now,

44
0:02:17.855,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but it's going to hit humans.

45
0:02:19.918,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We are aware now that nanoplastic,

46
0:02:23.113,000 --> 0:02:27,000
the very, very small particles of plastic, carrying their negative charge,

47
0:02:27.739,000 --> 0:02:29,000
can go straight through the pores of your skin.

48
0:02:31.39,000 --> 0:02:32,000
That's not the bad news.

49
0:02:32.589,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The bad news is that it goes straight through the blood-brain barrier,

50
0:02:37.155,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that protective coating which is there to protect your brain.

51
0:02:40.063,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Your brain's a little amorphous, wet mass full of little electrical charges.

52
0:02:44.094,000 --> 0:02:47,000
You put a negative particle into that,

53
0:02:47.395,000 --> 0:02:5,000
particularly a negative particle which can carry pathogens --

54
0:02:50.948,000 --> 0:02:53,000
so you have a negative charge, it attracts positive-charge elements,

55
0:02:54.556,000 --> 0:02:56,000
like pathogens, toxins,

56
0:02:57.004,000 --> 0:02:58,000
mercury, lead.

57
0:02:58.595,000 --> 0:03:01,000
That's the breaking science we're going to see in the next 12 months.

58
0:03:01.873,000 --> 0:03:04,000
CA: So already I think you told me that there's like 600 plastic bags or so

59
0:03:05.453,000 --> 0:03:08,000
for every fish that size in the ocean, something like that.

60
0:03:09.388,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And they're breaking down,

61
0:03:12.285,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and there's going to be ever more of them,

62
0:03:14.348,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and we haven't even seen the start of the consequences of that.

63
0:03:17.349,000 --> 0:03:18,000
AF: No, we really haven't.

64
0:03:18.97,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, they're a bunch of good scientists,

65
0:03:22.218,000 --> 0:03:24,000
we've been working with them for a while.

66
0:03:24.291,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I've completely verified their work.

67
0:03:26.055,000 --> 0:03:28,000
They say there will be one ton of plastic, Chris,

68
0:03:28.785,000 --> 0:03:3,000
for every three tons of fish by, not 2050 --

69
0:03:31.329,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and I really get impatient with people who talk about 2050 -- by 2025.

70
0:03:35.958,000 --> 0:03:36,000
That's around the corner.

71
0:03:37.225,000 --> 0:03:39,000
That's just the here and now.

72
0:03:39.372,000 --> 0:03:42,000
You don't need one ton of plastic to completely wipe out marine life.

73
0:03:42.655,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Less than that is going to do a fine job at it.

74
0:03:45.741,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So we have to end it straightaway. We've got no time.

75
0:03:50.235,000 --> 0:03:54,000
CA: OK, so you have an idea for ending it, and you're coming at this

76
0:03:54.628,000 --> 0:03:56,000
not as a typical environmental campaigner, I would say,

77
0:03:57.343,000 --> 0:04:,000
but as a businessman, as an entrepreneur, who has lived --

78
0:04:00.557,000 --> 0:04:03,000
you've spent your whole life thinking about global economic systems

79
0:04:04.07,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and how they work.

80
0:04:05.747,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And if I understand it right,

81
0:04:07.375,000 --> 0:04:13,000
your idea depends on heroes who look something like this.

82
0:04:13.921,000 --> 0:04:14,000
What's her profession?

83
0:04:15.457,000 --> 0:04:18,000
AF: She, Chris, is a ragpicker,

84
0:04:18.69,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and there were 15, 20 million ragpickers like her,

85
0:04:22.432,000 --> 0:04:26,000
until China stopped taking everyone's waste.

86
0:04:26.712,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And the price of plastic, minuscule that it was, collapsed.

87
0:04:30.951,000 --> 0:04:31,000
That led to people like her,

88
0:04:32.761,000 --> 0:04:36,000
which, now -- she is a child who is a schoolchild.

89
0:04:37.003,000 --> 0:04:38,000
She should be at school.

90
0:04:38.692,000 --> 0:04:4,000
That's probably very akin to slavery.

91
0:04:40.982,000 --> 0:04:42,000
My daughter Grace and I have met hundreds of people like her.

92
0:04:43.977,000 --> 0:04:46,000
CA: And there are many adults as well, literally millions around the world,

93
0:04:47.556,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and in some industries,

94
0:04:48.756,000 --> 0:04:5,000
they actually account for the fact that, for example,

95
0:04:51.345,000 --> 0:04:53,000
we don't see a lot of metal waste in the world.

96
0:04:53.571,000 --> 0:04:54,000
AF: That's exactly right.

97
0:04:54.815,000 --> 0:04:57,000
That little girl is, in fact, the hero of the environment.

98
0:04:57.969,000 --> 0:05:,000
She's in competition with a great big petrochemical plant

99
0:05:01.6,000 --> 0:05:02,000
which is just down the road,

100
0:05:02.974,000 --> 0:05:04,000
the three-and-a-half-billion-dollar petrochemical plant.

101
0:05:05.679,000 --> 0:05:06,000
That's the problem.

102
0:05:06.862,000 --> 0:05:1,000
We've got more oil and gas in plastic and landfill

103
0:05:11.331,000 --> 0:05:14,000
than we have in the entire oil and gas resources of the United States.

104
0:05:15.124,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So she is the hero.

105
0:05:17.171,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And that's what that landfill looks like, ladies and gentlemen,

106
0:05:20.161,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and it's solid oil and gas.

107
0:05:22.603,000 --> 0:05:25,000
CA: So there's huge value potentially locked up in there

108
0:05:26.299,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that the world's ragpickers would, if they could, make a living from.

109
0:05:30.862,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But why can't they?

110
0:05:33.303,000 --> 0:05:36,000
AF: Because we have ingrained in us

111
0:05:36.589,000 --> 0:05:4,000
a price of plastic from fossil fuels,

112
0:05:40.949,000 --> 0:05:43,000
which sits just under what it takes

113
0:05:44.544,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to economically and profitably recycle plastic from plastic.

114
0:05:49.118,000 --> 0:05:54,000
See, all plastic is is building blocks from oil and gas.

115
0:05:54.176,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Plastic's 100 percent polymer, which is 100 percent oil and gas.

116
0:05:58.085,000 --> 0:06:,000
And you know we've got enough plastic in the world

117
0:06:00.508,000 --> 0:06:01,000
for all our needs.

118
0:06:01.712,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And when we recycle plastic,

119
0:06:04.256,000 --> 0:06:07,000
if we can't recycle it cheaper than fossil fuel plastic,

120
0:06:07.545,000 --> 0:06:1,000
then, of course, the world just sticks to fossil fuel plastic.

121
0:06:10.904,000 --> 0:06:11,000
CA: So that's the fundamental problem,

122
0:06:12.908,000 --> 0:06:16,000
the price of recycled plastic is usually more

123
0:06:17.042,000 --> 0:06:21,000
than the price of just buying it made fresh from more oil.

124
0:06:21.582,000 --> 0:06:22,000
That's the fundamental problem.

125
0:06:23.153,000 --> 0:06:26,000
AF: A slight tweak of the rules here, Chris.

126
0:06:26.316,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I'm a commodity person.

127
0:06:28.108,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I understand that we used to have scrap metal and rubbish iron

128
0:06:35.131,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and bits of copper lying all round the villages,

129
0:06:38.166,000 --> 0:06:39,000
particularly in the developing world.

130
0:06:40.019,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And people worked out it's got a value.

131
0:06:41.939,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It's actually an article of value,

132
0:06:45.118,000 --> 0:06:46,000
not of waste.

133
0:06:46.562,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Now the villages and the cities and the streets are clean,

134
0:06:49.764,000 --> 0:06:53,000
you don't trip over scrap copper or scrap iron now,

135
0:06:54.326,000 --> 0:06:57,000
because it's an article of value, it gets recycled.

136
0:06:57.705,000 --> 0:07:02,000
CA: So what's your idea, then, to try to change that in plastics?

137
0:07:03.322,000 --> 0:07:04,000
AF: OK, so Chris,

138
0:07:04.958,000 --> 0:07:07,000
for most part of that PhD, I've been doing research.

139
0:07:08.941,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And the good thing about being a businessperson who's done OK at it

140
0:07:12.236,000 --> 0:07:13,000
is that people want to see you.

141
0:07:14.121,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Other businesspeople,

142
0:07:15.31,000 --> 0:07:19,000
even if you're kind of a bit of a zoo animal species they'd like to check out,

143
0:07:19.437,000 --> 0:07:21,000
they'll say, yeah, OK, we'll all meet Twiggy Forrest.

144
0:07:21.947,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And so once you're in there,

145
0:07:23.84,000 --> 0:07:24,000
you can interrogate them.

146
0:07:25.384,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And I've been to most of the oil and gas and fast-moving consumer good companies

147
0:07:31.377,000 --> 0:07:32,000
in the world,

148
0:07:32.602,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and there is a real will to change.

149
0:07:35.706,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I mean, there's a couple of dinosaurs

150
0:07:37.535,000 --> 0:07:39,000
who are going to hope for the best and do nothing,

151
0:07:40.047,000 --> 0:07:41,000
but there's a real will to change.

152
0:07:42.021,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So what I've been discussing is,

153
0:07:43.834,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the seven and a half billion people in the world

154
0:07:47.334,000 --> 0:07:5,000
don't actually deserve to have their environment smashed by plastic,

155
0:07:51.275,000 --> 0:07:56,000
their oceans rendered depauperate or barren of sea life because of plastic.

156
0:07:56.511,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So you come down that chain,

157
0:07:57.968,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and there's tens of thousands of brands which we all buy heaps of products from,

158
0:08:02.135,000 --> 0:08:05,000
but then there's only a hundred major resin producers,

159
0:08:05.634,000 --> 0:08:07,000
big petrochemical plants,

160
0:08:07.794,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that spew out all the plastic which is single use.

161
0:08:10.537,000 --> 0:08:11,000
CA: So one hundred companies

162
0:08:11.944,000 --> 0:08:13,000
are right at the base of this food chain, as it were.

163
0:08:14.469,000 --> 0:08:15,000
AF: Yeah.

164
0:08:15.652,000 --> 0:08:17,000
CA: And so what do you need those one hundred companies to do?

165
0:08:18.621,000 --> 0:08:22,000
AF: OK, so we need them to simply raise the value

166
0:08:23.194,000 --> 0:08:25,000
of the building blocks of plastic from oil and gas,

167
0:08:26.082,000 --> 0:08:28,000
which I call "bad plastic,"

168
0:08:28.681,000 --> 0:08:29,000
raise the value of that,

169
0:08:30.007,000 --> 0:08:33,000
so that when it spreads through the brands and onto us, the customers,

170
0:08:33.86,000 --> 0:08:37,000
we won't barely even notice an increase in our coffee cup

171
0:08:38.341,000 --> 0:08:4,000
or Coke or Pepsi, or anything.

172
0:08:41.348,000 --> 0:08:42,000
CA: Like, what, like a cent extra?

173
0:08:43.136,000 --> 0:08:44,000
AF: Less. Quarter of a cent, half a cent.

174
0:08:45.158,000 --> 0:08:48,000
It'll be absolutely minimal.

175
0:08:48.372,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But what it does,

176
0:08:49.649,000 --> 0:08:53,000
it makes every bit of plastic all over the world an article of value.

177
0:08:54.365,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Where you have the waste worst,

178
0:08:57.866,000 --> 0:08:58,000
say Southeast Asia, India,

179
0:08:59.774,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that's where the wealth is most.

180
0:09:01.879,000 --> 0:09:03,000
CA: OK, so it feels like there's two parts to this.

181
0:09:04.356,000 --> 0:09:07,000
One is, if they will charge more money

182
0:09:08.378,000 --> 0:09:11,000
but carve out that excess

183
0:09:11.585,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and pay it -- into what? -- a fund operated by someone

184
0:09:16.079,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to tackle this problem of -- what?

185
0:09:18.868,000 --> 0:09:21,000
What would that money be used for, that they charge the extra for?

186
0:09:22.483,000 --> 0:09:24,000
AF: So when I speak to really big businesses,

187
0:09:24.967,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I say, "Look, I need you to change, and I need you to change really fast,"

188
0:09:28.537,000 --> 0:09:3,000
their eyes are going to peel over in boredom,

189
0:09:31.277,000 --> 0:09:33,000
unless I say, "And it's good business."

190
0:09:33.64,000 --> 0:09:35,000
"OK, now you've got my attention, Andrew."

191
0:09:35.757,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So I say, "Right, I need you to make a contribution

192
0:09:38.617,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to an environmental and industry transition fund.

193
0:09:41.177,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Over two or three years,

194
0:09:42.636,000 --> 0:09:44,000
the entire global plastics industry

195
0:09:44.857,000 --> 0:09:48,000
can transition from getting its building blocks from fossil fuel

196
0:09:48.987,000 --> 0:09:5,000
to getting its building blocks from plastic.

197
0:09:51.106,000 --> 0:09:52,000
The technology is out there.

198
0:09:52.591,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It's proven."

199
0:09:53.885,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I've taken two multibillion-dollar operations from nothing,

200
0:09:57.386,000 --> 0:09:59,000
recognizing that the technology can be scaled.

201
0:10:00.229,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I see at least a dozen technologies in plastic to handle all types of plastic.

202
0:10:04.747,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So once those technologies have an economic margin,

203
0:10:08.323,000 --> 0:10:09,000
which this gives them,

204
0:10:10.269,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that's where the global public will get all their plastic from,

205
0:10:13.557,000 --> 0:10:14,000
from existing plastic.

206
0:10:15.455,000 --> 0:10:19,000
CA: So every sale of virgin plastic contributes money to a fund

207
0:10:19.62,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that is used to basically transition the industry

208
0:10:22.478,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and start to pay for things like cleanup and other pieces.

209
0:10:25.345,000 --> 0:10:26,000
AF: Absolutely. Absolutely.

210
0:10:26.734,000 --> 0:10:28,000
CA: And it has the incredible side benefit,

211
0:10:28.77,000 --> 0:10:29,000
which is maybe even the main benefit,

212
0:10:30.575,000 --> 0:10:31,000
of creating a market.

213
0:10:31.949,000 --> 0:10:34,000
It suddenly makes recyclable plastic

214
0:10:35.105,000 --> 0:10:39,000
a giant business that can unlock millions of people around the world

215
0:10:39.718,000 --> 0:10:4,000
to find a new living collecting it.

216
0:10:41.583,000 --> 0:10:42,000
AF: Yeah, exactly.

217
0:10:42.76,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So all you do is, you've got fossil fuel plastics at this value

218
0:10:47.308,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and recycled plastic at this value.

219
0:10:49.389,000 --> 0:10:5,000
You change it.

220
0:10:50.726,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So recycled plastic is cheaper.

221
0:10:53.636,000 --> 0:10:56,000
What I love about this most, Chris, is that, you know,

222
0:10:56.827,000 --> 0:11:01,000
we waste into the environment 300, 350 million tons of plastic.

223
0:11:02.402,000 --> 0:11:04,000
On the oil and gas companies own accounts,

224
0:11:04.963,000 --> 0:11:06,000
it's going to grow to 500 million tons.

225
0:11:07.003,000 --> 0:11:09,000
This is an accelerating problem.

226
0:11:09.455,000 --> 0:11:12,000
But every ton of that is polymer.

227
0:11:13.229,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Polymer is 1,000 dollars, 1,500 dollars a ton.

228
0:11:16.757,000 --> 0:11:2,000
That's half a trillion dollars which could go into business

229
0:11:20.885,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and could create jobs and opportunities and wealth right across the world,

230
0:11:24.448,000 --> 0:11:25,000
particularly in the most impoverished.

231
0:11:26.471,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Yet we throw it away.

232
0:11:27.752,000 --> 0:11:3,000
CA: So this would allow the big companies to invest in recycling plants

233
0:11:31.156,000 --> 0:11:32,000
literally all over the world --

234
0:11:32.689,000 --> 0:11:33,000
AF: All over the world.

235
0:11:33.865,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Because the technology is low-capital cost,

236
0:11:35.937,000 --> 0:11:38,000
you can put it in at rubbish dumps, at the bottom of big hotels,

237
0:11:38.998,000 --> 0:11:39,000
garbage depots, everywhere,

238
0:11:40.324,000 --> 0:11:41,000
turn that waste into resin.

239
0:11:41.642,000 --> 0:11:42,000
CA: Now, you're a philanthropist,

240
0:11:43.264,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and you're ready to commit some of your own wealth to this.

241
0:11:46.077,000 --> 0:11:48,000
What is the role of philanthropy in this project?

242
0:11:48.399,000 --> 0:11:51,000
AF: I think what we have to do is kick in the 40 to 50 million US dollars

243
0:11:52.257,000 --> 0:11:53,000
to get it going,

244
0:11:53.681,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and then we have to create absolute transparency

245
0:11:56.174,000 --> 0:11:59,000
so everyone can see exactly what's going on.

246
0:11:59.428,000 --> 0:12:02,000
From the resin producers to the brands to the consumers,

247
0:12:02.712,000 --> 0:12:04,000
everyone gets to see who is playing the game,

248
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
who is protecting the Earth, and who doesn't care.

249
0:12:07.942,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And that'll cost about a million dollars a week,

250
0:12:10.297,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and we're going to underwrite that for five years.

251
0:12:12.707,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Total contribution is circa 300 million US dollars.

252
0:12:15.561,000 --> 0:12:16,000
CA: Wow.

253
0:12:16.912,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Now --

254
0:12:18.189,000 --> 0:12:22,000
(Applause)

255
0:12:23.095,000 --> 0:12:26,000
You've talked to other companies, like to the Coca-Colas of this world,

256
0:12:26.55,000 --> 0:12:29,000
who are willing to do this, they're willing to pay a higher price,

257
0:12:29.712,000 --> 0:12:3,000
they would like to pay a higher price,

258
0:12:31.563,000 --> 0:12:32,000
so long as it's fair.

259
0:12:32.742,000 --> 0:12:34,000
AF: Yeah, it's fair.

260
0:12:35.15,000 --> 0:12:38,000
So, Coca-Cola wouldn't like Pepsi to play ball

261
0:12:38.329,000 --> 0:12:4,000
unless the whole world knew that Pepsi wasn't playing ball.

262
0:12:41.15,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Then they don't care.

263
0:12:42.348,000 --> 0:12:44,000
So it's that transparency of the market

264
0:12:45.266,000 --> 0:12:47,000
where, if people try and cheat the system,

265
0:12:47.624,000 --> 0:12:49,000
the market can see it, the consumers can see it.

266
0:12:50.009,000 --> 0:12:52,000
The consumers want a role to play in this.

267
0:12:52.159,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Seven and a half billion of us.

268
0:12:53.71,000 --> 0:12:55,000
We don't want our world smashed by a hundred companies.

269
0:12:56.344,000 --> 0:12:58,000
CA: Well, so tell us, you've said what the companies can do

270
0:12:59.176,000 --> 0:13:,000
and what you're willing to do.

271
0:13:00.667,000 --> 0:13:01,000
What can people listening do?

272
0:13:02.084,000 --> 0:13:04,000
AF: OK, so I would like all of us,

273
0:13:04.405,000 --> 0:13:05,000
all around the world,

274
0:13:05.628,000 --> 0:13:08,000
to go a website called noplasticwaste.org.

275
0:13:08.736,000 --> 0:13:1,000
You contact your hundred resin producers

276
0:13:10.886,000 --> 0:13:11,000
which are in your region.

277
0:13:12.35,000 --> 0:13:13,000
You will have at least one

278
0:13:14.047,000 --> 0:13:18,000
within an email or Twitter or a telephone contact from you,

279
0:13:18.505,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and let them know that you would like them to make a contribution to a fund

280
0:13:23.964,000 --> 0:13:25,000
which industry can manage or the World Bank can manage.

281
0:13:26.615,000 --> 0:13:29,000
It raises tens of billions of dollars per year

282
0:13:30.333,000 --> 0:13:34,000
so you can transition the industry to getting all its plastic from plastic,

283
0:13:35.039,000 --> 0:13:36,000
not from fossil fuel.

284
0:13:36.235,000 --> 0:13:38,000
We don't need that. That's bad. This is good.

285
0:13:38.506,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And it can clean up the environment.

286
0:13:40.542,000 --> 0:13:41,000
We've got enough capital there,

287
0:13:42.119,000 --> 0:13:44,000
we've got tens of billions of dollars, Chris, per annum

288
0:13:45.1,000 --> 0:13:46,000
to clean up the environment.

289
0:13:46.556,000 --> 0:13:47,000
CA: You're in the recycling business.

290
0:13:48.355,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Isn't this a conflict of interest for you,

291
0:13:50.385,000 --> 0:13:52,000
or rather, a huge business opportunity for you?

292
0:13:52.619,000 --> 0:13:54,000
AF: Yeah, look, I'm in the iron ore business,

293
0:13:54.775,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and I compete against the scrap metal business,

294
0:13:57.008,000 --> 0:14:,000
and that's why you don't have any scrap lying around to trip over,

295
0:14:00.467,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and cut your toe on,

296
0:14:01.94,000 --> 0:14:02,000
because it gets collected.

297
0:14:03.24,000 --> 0:14:06,000
CA: This isn't your excuse to go into the plastic recycling business.

298
0:14:06.558,000 --> 0:14:08,000
AF: No, I am going to cheer for this boom.

299
0:14:08.903,000 --> 0:14:1,000
This will be the internet of plastic waste.

300
0:14:11.038,000 --> 0:14:14,000
This will be a boom industry which will spread all over the world,

301
0:14:14.401,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and particularly where poverty is worst because that's where the rubbish is most,

302
0:14:18.484,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and that's the resource.

303
0:14:19.824,000 --> 0:14:22,000
So I'm going to cheer for it and stand back.

304
0:14:23.055,000 --> 0:14:24,000
CA: Twiggy, we're in an era

305
0:14:24.424,000 --> 0:14:28,000
where so many people around the world are craving a new, regenerative economy,

306
0:14:29.113,000 --> 0:14:31,000
these big supply chains, these big industries,

307
0:14:31.766,000 --> 0:14:33,000
to fundamentally transform.

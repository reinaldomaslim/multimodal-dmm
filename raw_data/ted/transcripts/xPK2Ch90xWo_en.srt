1
0:00:12.949,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Rainforest noises)

2
0:00:21.68,000 --> 0:00:24,000
In the summer of 2011, as a tourist,

3
0:00:25.167,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I visited the rainforests of Borneo for the very first time,

4
0:00:29.593,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and as you might imagine,

5
0:00:31.641,000 --> 0:00:36,000
it was the overwhelming sounds of the forest that struck me the most.

6
0:00:36.911,000 --> 0:00:38,000
There's this constant cacophony of noise.

7
0:00:39.721,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Some things actually do stick out.

8
0:00:42.136,000 --> 0:00:46,000
For example, this here is a big bird, a rhinoceros hornbill.

9
0:00:46.562,000 --> 0:00:5,000
This buzzing is a cicada.

10
0:00:51.434,000 --> 0:00:53,000
This is a family of gibbons.

11
0:00:54.047,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It's actually singing to each other over a great distance.

12
0:00:59.341,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The place where this was recorded was in fact a gibbon reserve,

13
0:01:02.334,000 --> 0:01:04,000
which is why you can hear so many of them,

14
0:01:04.372,000 --> 0:01:08,000
but in fact the most important noise that was coming out of the forest that time

15
0:01:09.302,000 --> 0:01:1,000
was one that I didn't notice,

16
0:01:10.834,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and in fact nobody there had actually noticed it.

17
0:01:14.373,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So, as I said, this was a gibbon reserve.

18
0:01:16.361,000 --> 0:01:18,000
They spend most of their time rehabilitating gibbons,

19
0:01:19.17,000 --> 0:01:21,000
but they also have to spend a lot of their time

20
0:01:21.731,000 --> 0:01:24,000
protecting their area from illegal logging that takes place on the side.

21
0:01:25.423,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And so if we take the sound of the forest

22
0:01:27.466,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and we actually turn down the gibbons, the insects, and the rest,

23
0:01:31.023,000 --> 0:01:34,000
in the background, the entire time, in recordings you heard,

24
0:01:34.689,000 --> 0:01:37,000
was the sound of a chainsaw at great distance.

25
0:01:38.403,000 --> 0:01:41,000
They had three full-time guards who were posted around this sanctuary

26
0:01:42.397,000 --> 0:01:46,000
whose job was in fact to guard against illegal logging,

27
0:01:46.599,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and one day, we went walking, again as tourists, out into the forest,

28
0:01:50.058,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and within five minutes' walk,

29
0:01:52.311,000 --> 0:01:55,000
we stumbled upon somebody who was just sawing a tree down,

30
0:01:55.69,000 --> 0:01:58,000
five minutes' walk, a few hundred meters from the ranger station.

31
0:01:58.951,000 --> 0:02:,000
They hadn't been able to hear the chainsaws,

32
0:02:01.009,000 --> 0:02:04,000
because as you heard, the forest is very, very loud.

33
0:02:04.826,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It struck me as quite unacceptable that in this modern time,

34
0:02:08.745,000 --> 0:02:12,000
just a few hundred meters away from a ranger station in a sanctuary,

35
0:02:13.217,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that in fact nobody could hear it when someone who has a chainsaw gets fired up.

36
0:02:17.022,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It sounds impossible, but in fact, it was quite true.

37
0:02:21.689,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So how do we stop illegal logging?

38
0:02:23.523,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It's really tempting, as an engineer, always to come up with a high-tech,

39
0:02:26.952,000 --> 0:02:27,000
super-crazy high-tech solution,

40
0:02:28.713,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but in fact, you're in the rainforest.

41
0:02:30.663,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It has to be simple, it has to be scalable,

42
0:02:33.04,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and so what we also noticed while were there was that

43
0:02:36.048,000 --> 0:02:38,000
everything we needed was already there.

44
0:02:38.374,000 --> 0:02:4,000
We could build a system that would allow us to stop this

45
0:02:41.125,000 --> 0:02:43,000
using what's already there.

46
0:02:43.407,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Who was there? What was already in the forest?

47
0:02:45.639,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Well, we had people.

48
0:02:46.787,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We had this group there that was dedicated, three full-time guards,

49
0:02:50.072,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that was dedicated to go and stop it,

50
0:02:51.846,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but they just needed to know what was happening out in the forest.

51
0:02:54.96,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The real surprise, this is the big one,

52
0:02:56.853,000 --> 0:02:58,000
was that there was connectivity out in the forest.

53
0:02:59.236,000 --> 0:03:01,000
There was cell phone service way out in the middle of nowhere.

54
0:03:02.15,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We're talking hundreds of kilometers from the nearest road,

55
0:03:05.081,000 --> 0:03:08,000
there's certainly no electricity, but they had very good cell phone service,

56
0:03:08.653,000 --> 0:03:1,000
these people in the towns were on Facebook all the time,

57
0:03:11.276,000 --> 0:03:12,000
they're surfing the web on their phones,

58
0:03:13.226,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and this sort of got me thinking that in fact it would be possible

59
0:03:16.335,000 --> 0:03:18,000
to use the sounds of the forest,

60
0:03:18.494,000 --> 0:03:2,000
pick up the sounds of chainsaws programmatically,

61
0:03:20.886,000 --> 0:03:21,000
because people can't hear them,

62
0:03:22.534,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and send an alert.

63
0:03:24.221,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But you have to have a device to go up in the trees.

64
0:03:26.803,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So if we can use some device to listen to the sounds of the forest,

65
0:03:30.454,000 --> 0:03:32,000
connect to the cell phone network that's there,

66
0:03:32.687,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and send an alert to people on the ground,

67
0:03:34.721,000 --> 0:03:37,000
perhaps we could have a solution to this issue for them.

68
0:03:38.271,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But let's take a moment to talk about saving the rainforest,

69
0:03:41.551,000 --> 0:03:44,000
because it's something that we've definitely all heard about forever.

70
0:03:45.393,000 --> 0:03:47,000
People in my generation have heard about saving the rainforest

71
0:03:48.312,000 --> 0:03:49,000
since we were kids,

72
0:03:50.212,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and it seems that the message has never changed:

73
0:03:52.46,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We've got to save the rainforest, it's super urgent,

74
0:03:54.982,000 --> 0:03:56,000
this many football fields have been destroyed yesterday.

75
0:03:57.688,000 --> 0:04:,000
and yet here we are today, about half of the rainforest remains,

76
0:04:00.992,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and we have potentially more urgent problems like climate change.

77
0:04:05.319,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But in fact, this is the little-known fact that I didn't realize at the time:

78
0:04:09.228,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Deforestation accounts for more greenhouse gas

79
0:04:12.189,000 --> 0:04:16,000
than all of the world's planes, trains, cars, trucks and ships combined.

80
0:04:16.229,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It's the second highest contributor to climate change.

81
0:04:18.945,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Also, according to Interpol,

82
0:04:21.778,000 --> 0:04:24,000
as much as 90 percent of the logging that takes place in the rainforest

83
0:04:25.307,000 --> 0:04:28,000
is illegal logging, like the illegal logging that we saw.

84
0:04:29.088,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So if we can help people in the forest enforce the rules that are there,

85
0:04:33.132,000 --> 0:04:36,000
then in fact we could eat heavily into this 17 percent

86
0:04:37.056,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and potentially have a major impact in the short term.

87
0:04:39.667,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It might just be the cheapest, fastest way to fight climate change.

88
0:04:44.832,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And so here's the system that we imagine.

89
0:04:46.83,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It looks super high tech.

90
0:04:48.024,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The moment a sound of a chainsaw is heard in the forest,

91
0:04:50.657,000 --> 0:04:52,000
the device picks up the sound of the chainsaw,

92
0:04:52.829,000 --> 0:04:55,000
it sends an alert through the standard GSM network that's already there

93
0:04:56.436,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to a ranger in the field

94
0:04:58.523,000 --> 0:05:,000
who can in fact show up in real time and stop the logging.

95
0:05:01.34,000 --> 0:05:04,000
It's no more about going out and finding a tree that's been cut.

96
0:05:05.249,000 --> 0:05:07,000
It's not about seeing a tree from a satellite

97
0:05:07.425,000 --> 0:05:08,000
in an area that's been clear cut,

98
0:05:09.061,000 --> 0:05:11,000
it's about real-time intervention.

99
0:05:11.669,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So I said it was the cheapest and fastest way to do it,

100
0:05:14.39,000 --> 0:05:16,000
but in fact, actually, as you saw, they weren't able to do it,

101
0:05:17.315,000 --> 0:05:18,000
so it may not be so cheap and fast.

102
0:05:19.199,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But if the devices in the trees were actually cell phones,

103
0:05:22.635,000 --> 0:05:23,000
it could be pretty cheap.

104
0:05:24.191,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Cell phones are thrown away by the hundreds of millions every year,

105
0:05:28.478,000 --> 0:05:3,000
hundreds of millions in the U.S. alone,

106
0:05:30.599,000 --> 0:05:33,000
not counting the rest of the world, which of course we should do,

107
0:05:33.78,000 --> 0:05:35,000
but in fact, cell phones are great.

108
0:05:36.311,000 --> 0:05:37,000
They're full of sensors.

109
0:05:37.644,000 --> 0:05:39,000
They can listen to the sounds of the forest.

110
0:05:39.796,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We do have to protect them.

111
0:05:41.178,000 --> 0:05:43,000
We have to put them in this box that you see here,

112
0:05:43.585,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and we do have to power them.

113
0:05:45.152,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Powering them is one of the greater engineering challenges

114
0:05:47.915,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that we had to deal with,

115
0:05:49.215,000 --> 0:05:51,000
because powering a cell phone under a tree canopy,

116
0:05:51.967,000 --> 0:05:53,000
any sort of solar power under a tree canopy,

117
0:05:54.219,000 --> 0:05:55,000
was an as-yet-unsolved problem,

118
0:05:56.029,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and that's this unique solar panel design that you see here,

119
0:05:58.886,000 --> 0:06:02,000
which in fact is built also from recycled byproducts of an industrial process.

120
0:06:03.205,000 --> 0:06:05,000
These are strips that are cut down.

121
0:06:05.829,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So this is me putting it all together

122
0:06:09.335,000 --> 0:06:1,000
in my parents' garage, actually.

123
0:06:11.216,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Thanks very much to them for allowing me to do that.

124
0:06:13.793,000 --> 0:06:17,000
As you can see, this is a device up in a tree.

125
0:06:18.149,000 --> 0:06:21,000
What you can see from here, perhaps, is that they are pretty well obscured

126
0:06:21.734,000 --> 0:06:22,000
up in the tree canopy at a distance.

127
0:06:23.536,000 --> 0:06:26,000
That's important, because although they are able to hear chainsaw noises

128
0:06:27.013,000 --> 0:06:28,000
up to a kilometer in the distance,

129
0:06:28.783,000 --> 0:06:3,000
allowing them to cover about three square kilometers,

130
0:06:31.303,000 --> 0:06:34,000
if someone were to take them, it would make the area unprotected.

131
0:06:35.281,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So does it actually work?

132
0:06:38.034,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Well, to test it, we took it back to Indonesia,

133
0:06:41.006,000 --> 0:06:43,000
not the same place, but another place,

134
0:06:43.119,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to another gibbon reserve

135
0:06:44.79,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that was threatened daily by illegal logging.

136
0:06:48.505,000 --> 0:06:51,000
On the very second day, it picked up illegal chainsaw noises.

137
0:06:52.424,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We were able to get a real-time alert.

138
0:06:54.623,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I got an email on my phone.

139
0:06:55.97,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Actually, we had just climbed the tree. Everyone had just gotten back down.

140
0:06:59.686,000 --> 0:07:01,000
All these guys are smoking cigarettes,

141
0:07:01.926,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and then I get an email, and they all quiet down,

142
0:07:04.783,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and in fact you can hear the chainsaw

143
0:07:06.887,000 --> 0:07:07,000
really, really faint in the background,

144
0:07:08.816,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but no one had noticed it until that moment.

145
0:07:11.121,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And so then we took off to actually stop these loggers.

146
0:07:14.395,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I was pretty nervous.

147
0:07:15.904,000 --> 0:07:19,000
This is the moment where we've actually arrived close to where the loggers are.

148
0:07:20.13,000 --> 0:07:23,000
This is the moment where you can see where I'm actually regretting

149
0:07:23.244,000 --> 0:07:25,000
perhaps the entire endeavor.

150
0:07:25.245,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I'm not really sure what's on the other side of this hill.

151
0:07:27.988,000 --> 0:07:28,000
That guy's much braver than I am.

152
0:07:29.951,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But he went, so I had to go, walking up,

153
0:07:34.131,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and in fact, he made it over the hill,

154
0:07:36.29,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and interrupted the loggers in the act.

155
0:07:39.527,000 --> 0:07:4,000
For them, it was such a surprise --

156
0:07:41.189,000 --> 0:07:43,000
they had never, ever been interrupted before --

157
0:07:43.569,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that it was such an impressive event for them,

158
0:07:45.734,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that we've heard from our partners they have not been back since.

159
0:07:48.85,000 --> 0:07:49,000
They were, in fact, great guys.

160
0:07:50.342,000 --> 0:07:52,000
They showed us how the entire operation works,

161
0:07:52.522,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and what they really convinced us on the spot was that

162
0:07:55.096,000 --> 0:07:57,000
if you can show up in real time and stop people,

163
0:07:57.341,000 --> 0:08:01,000
it's enough of a deterrent they won't come back.

164
0:08:01.529,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So --

165
0:08:03.085,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Thank you. (Applause)

166
0:08:09.586,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Word of this spread, possibly because we told a lot of people,

167
0:08:13.44,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and in fact, then some really amazing stuff started to happen.

168
0:08:16.877,000 --> 0:08:19,000
People from around the world started to send us emails, phone calls.

169
0:08:20.546,000 --> 0:08:22,000
What we saw was that people throughout Asia,

170
0:08:22.635,000 --> 0:08:24,000
people throughout Africa, people throughout South America,

171
0:08:25.377,000 --> 0:08:26,000
they told us that they could use it too,

172
0:08:27.288,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and what's most important,

173
0:08:28.568,000 --> 0:08:3,000
what we'd found that we thought might be exceptional,

174
0:08:31.066,000 --> 0:08:33,000
in the forest there was pretty good cell phone service.

175
0:08:33.648,000 --> 0:08:34,000
That was not exceptional, we were told,

176
0:08:35.525,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and that particularly is on the periphery of the forests that are most under threat.

177
0:08:39.468,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And then something really amazing happened,

178
0:08:41.768,000 --> 0:08:44,000
which was that people started sending us their own old cell phones.

179
0:08:45.251,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So in fact what we have now is a system

180
0:08:47.201,000 --> 0:08:5,000
where we can use people on the ground, people who are already there,

181
0:08:50.544,000 --> 0:08:53,000
who can both improve and use the existing connectivity,

182
0:08:53.609,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and we're using old cell phones that are being sent to us

183
0:08:56.286,000 --> 0:08:57,000
by people from around the world

184
0:08:57.779,000 --> 0:09:,000
that want their phones to be doing something else in their afterlife,

185
0:09:01.072,000 --> 0:09:01,000
so to speak.

186
0:09:01.826,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And if the rest of the device can be completely recycled,

187
0:09:04.755,000 --> 0:09:06,000
then we believe it's an entirely upcycled device.

188
0:09:07.471,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So again, this didn't come because of any sort of high-tech solution.

189
0:09:11.125,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It just came from using what's already there,

190
0:09:13.438,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and I'm thoroughly convinced that if it's not phones,

191
0:09:16.294,000 --> 0:09:18,000
that there's always going to be enough there

192
0:09:18.663,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that you can build similar solutions

193
0:09:20.474,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that can be very effective in new contexts.

194
0:09:22.54,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Thank you very much.

195
0:09:24.676,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Applause)

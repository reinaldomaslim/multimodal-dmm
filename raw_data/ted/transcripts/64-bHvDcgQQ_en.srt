1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
"The Better Man."

2
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I was the better at getting and keeping.

3
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
You were the better at spend and spend;

4
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I was the better at grubbing and heaping,

5
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
But who was the better man in the end?

6
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Yes, who was the better man, my friend?

7
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
You were the better with lords and ladies,

8
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I was the better at pillaging Troy;

9
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
You were the better at kissing the babies,

10
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I was the better at search and destroy.

11
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But who was the better man, old boy?

12
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
Who was the better man?

13
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I was the better at improvisation,

14
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
You were the better at spinning the plates;

15
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I was the better at procrastination,

16
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
You were the better at quiet debate.

17
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But who was the better man, old mate?

18
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Who was the better man?

19
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
You were the better at rolling a reefer,

20
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I was the better at coke and rum;

21
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Remember that night on the beach in Ibiza?

22
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
The Maori twins

23
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
with the tattooed bum?

24
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But who was the better man, old chum?

25
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Who was the better man?

26
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Now we come down to it, relatives grieving.

27
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Out in the hall with their crocodile tears;

28
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Now that you're out of it, now that you're leaving,

29
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Now that they've sealed your arse and your ears,

30
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
What I've been meaning to tell you for years,

31
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And years, and years, and years, old friend ...

32
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Is that you were the better man, in the end;

33
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
You were the better man,

34
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
My friend.

35
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Applause)

36
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I wrote this next poem for my mother.

37
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Every one of us had a mother,

38
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
only one --

39
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
probably the most important person in your life,

40
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
if you're lucky enough to know them.

41
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
My mother was certainly the most important in mine.

42
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Let me try and describe her to you.

43
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
She's 86 years old. She's frail.

44
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
White, platinum hair.

45
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Why do they do that? Why do old ladies go to those hair shops,

46
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and make those helmets?

47
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Laughter)

48
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Bright as a button. All the ducks in a row.

49
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Looks like a much prettier version

50
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
of Margaret Thatcher,

51
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Laughter)

52
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but without any of the soft bits in Margaret's character.

53
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Laughter)

54
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I wrote this poem for her. These are not my beliefs.

55
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But my mother has lived by this creed

56
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
all her life.

57
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
"Never Go Back."

58
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Never go back. Never go back.

59
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Never return to the haunts of your youth.

60
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Keep to the track, to the beaten track;

61
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Memory holds all you need of the truth.

62
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Never look back. Never look back.

63
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Never succumb to the gorgon's stare.

64
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Keep to the track, to the beaten track;

65
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
No-one is waiting and nothing is there.

66
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Never go back. Never go back.

67
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Never surrender the future you earned.

68
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Keep to the track, to the beaten track;

69
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Never return to the bridges you've burned.

70
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Never look back. Never look back.

71
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Never retreat to the 'glorious past.'

72
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Keep to the track, to the beaten track;

73
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Treat every day of your life as your last.

74
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Never go back. Never go back.

75
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Never acknowledge the ghost on the stair.

76
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Keep to the track, to the beaten track;

77
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
No-one is waiting and nothing is there.

78
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
(Applause)

79
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Now ladies and gentlemen, I'm up on me hobbyhorse.

80
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
If every commercially minded cosmetic surgeon

81
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
were tied end to end along a railroad track,

82
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
that would be me,

83
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
stoking the train

84
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
without a qualm in the world.

85
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Ladies, don't do it.

86
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Don't do it.

87
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
You think we want you to do it, but we don't want you to do it.

88
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Stop it.

89
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Tell them to go to hell.

90
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
You bodies are wonderful as they are.

91
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Just leave them alone.

92
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
"To a Beautiful Lady of a Certain Age."

93
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Lady lady, do not weep.

94
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
What is gone is gone. Now sleep.

95
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Turn your pillow. Dry your tears.

96
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Count thy sheep and not thy years.

97
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Nothing good can come of this.

98
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Time rules all, my dearest.

99
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
'Tis but folly to be waging war

100
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
On one who never lost before.

101
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Lady, this is all in vain.

102
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Youth can never come again;

103
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We have drunk the summer wine.

104
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
None can make a stitch in time.

105
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Nip and tuck till crack of doom.

106
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
What is foretold in the womb

107
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
May not be foresworn with gold.

108
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Nor may time be bought or sold.

109
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Dearest, do I love thee less?

110
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Do I shrink from thy caress?

111
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Think you I could cease to care?

112
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Never was there one so fair!

113
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Lady lady, do not weep --

114
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
What is gone is gone. Now sleep.

115
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Lean against me, calm your fears,

116
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Count thy blessings, not thy years.

117
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
(Applause)

118
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
America, ladies and gentlemen, has done more for me financially than Britain

119
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
ever has, or ever could have done.

120
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I was born in Britain, as you have probably guessed.

121
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Even when on its worst behavior,

122
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I find myself automatically defending the USA

123
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
from the sneers of green-eyed Europhiles

124
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
playing their Greek card to Roman trumps.

125
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
America is an empire.

126
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I hope you know that now.

127
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
All empires, by definition, are bumbling,

128
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
shambolic, bullying, bureaucratic affairs,

129
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
as certain of the rightness of their cause in infancy,

130
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
as they are corrupted by power in their dotage.

131
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I am no historian, ladies and gentlemen.

132
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But it seems to be that the USA's sins,

133
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
compared to those of many previous empires,

134
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
are of a more moderate,

135
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
if more pervasive, kind.

136
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Let me put this bluntly.

137
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
If Americans are so fat,

138
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
stupid and ignorant,

139
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
my dear friends from Birmingham,

140
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
how come they rule the world?

141
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
"Hail to the Gods of America."

142
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Hail to the Gods of America!

143
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Hail to the gods of the dream.

144
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Invictus E Pluribus Unum.

145
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
But which of them reigns supreme?

146
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Which is America's Jupiter?

147
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The Brahmins of Capital Hill?

148
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
A sorcerer's profit on Wall Street?

149
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
They eye of a dollar bill?

150
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Or is it celebrity status?

151
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
The worship of those we hate.

152
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Or the cult of living forever,

153
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
If only we'd watch our weight.

154
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
What of the titans of media?

155
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Or Hollywood's siren call?

156
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
What of the temples of justice,

157
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Whose servants enslave us all?

158
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
What of the Brand and the Label?

159
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
What of the upstart Sport?

160
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And what of the Constitution,

161
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
That bully of last resort?

162
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Hail to the God of America,

163
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Whose power the masses extol --

164
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Convenience rules America;

165
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Convenience owns our soul.

166
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Aye, that it does.

167
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
(Applause)

168
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And if you would like to know why I am not a father --

169
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I, who by a miracle have 22 godchildren --

170
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
the answer is in this poem,

171
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
which upsets me every time I read it.

172
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
"Love Came to Visit Me."

173
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Love came to visit me,

174
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
shy as a fawn.

175
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But finding me busy,

176
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
she fled, with the dawn.

177
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
At 20 the torch of resentment was lit.

178
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
My rage at injustice

179
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
waxed hot as the pits.

180
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
The flux of its lava cleared all in its path.

181
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Comrades and enemies fled from its wrath.

182
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Yet lovers grew wary, once novelty waned

183
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
To lie with a bloody man,

184
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
his terror unfeigned.

185
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
At 30 my powers seemed mighty to me.

186
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
The fruits of my rivals, I shook from the tree.

187
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
By guile and by bluster,

188
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
by night and by day,

189
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
I battered and scattered the fools from my way.

190
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And women grew willing to sham and to bluff.

191
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Their trinkets and baubles cost little enough.

192
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
From 40 to 50, grown easy and sly,

193
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I wined them and dined them, like pigs in a sty.

194
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
We feasted and reveled and rutted in muck,

195
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Forgetting our peril, forgetting to duck,

196
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Forgetting times arrows are sharper than knives.

197
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Grown sick to our stomachs,

198
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and sick of our lives.

199
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Love came to visit me,

200
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
shy as a fawn.

201
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
But finding me busy,

202
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
she fled with the dawn.

203
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
(Applause)

204
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Um, there are --

205
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
I've got far too much money and I have far too much fun

206
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
in my businesses.

207
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
So poetry came as a complete shock to me, ladies and gentlemen.

208
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
A complete shock. I was a little ill.

209
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Okay, I was ill.

210
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Okay, I had a life-threatening illness, you know.

211
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I was in a clinic. I wasn't allowed to make telephone calls.

212
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
I wasn't allowed to see any of my -- you know, whatever.

213
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
So, in the end I begged a pack of Post-it notes off a nurse.

214
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And from another nurse, I begged a pencil, pen.

215
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And I didn't know what else to do. So I started to write poetry.

216
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
That was in October of 2000.

217
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I'm not an evil man.

218
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
But sometimes I try to put myself in an evil man's position.

219
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I'm not a glorious and fantastic-looking woman,

220
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
who men fall down, you know, when she walks in a room.

221
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
But sometimes I try to put myself in that position.

222
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
(Laughter)

223
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Not with much success.

224
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
But it's interesting to me. I love to write historical verse.

225
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
I love to think what they thought, what it was like.

226
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Because although

227
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
many of the speakers and many of the people who are in the audience,

228
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
although you guys can not only go to the moon,

229
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
you know, you're going to totally transform everything.

230
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Cloning will transform everything. Voice navigation will transform everything.

231
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
I don't know. You can do anything you want.

232
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
All you guys are so clever, and women, you can do it all!

233
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
But human nature doesn't change, mate.

234
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
My friends, human nature is exactly the same as it was

235
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
when my ancestor --

236
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
probably it was my ancestor --

237
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
got his hands around the neck of the last Neanderthal,

238
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and battered the bastard to death.

239
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
You think we didn't do that?

240
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Oh, we did.

241
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
We killed every single one of them.

242
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Inch by inch we killed them.

243
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
We hunted them down wherever they were.

244
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Rivals for meat. Rivals for berries.

245
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
We're still doing it,

246
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
with all of the genius assembled in this room.

247
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Our natures haven't changed a single iota.

248
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And they never will.

249
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Even when we've got off this little planet,

250
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and have put some of our eggs in some other baskets.

251
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And I am as bad as you.

252
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
I spent eight years

253
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
running one of the most successful publishing businesses in the world.

254
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And at seven o'clock every night,

255
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
I took me some more girls, already corrupted.

256
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I never did anything to anyone that wasn't.

257
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
And I took crack cocaine,

258
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
every single night for seven years.

259
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
It was like Dante's "Inferno."

260
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
It was unbelievable.

261
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
One of the offshoots of crack cocaine is that you keep an erection

262
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
for about four hours.

263
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And you stay up for 12.

264
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
It was absolutely unbelievable.

265
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Twenty-two godchildren I've got.

266
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
What do I say to them?

267
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I only stopped because I thought if I got caught,

268
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
what would happen to my mother.

269
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
If you're a woman, remember that.

270
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
The love of your son

271
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
can utterly transform anything he does.

272
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
"Our Lady in White."

273
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Pale she was, listless;

274
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
And soft to the touch.

275
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
A generous mistress Whom many loved much.

276
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Shoulder to shoulder, Night after night,

277
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
We hoarded and sold her --

278
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Our Lady in White.

279
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
We breathed but to savor

280
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
her crystal caress.

281
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
We craved but to favor the hem of her dress.

282
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
We dabbled and babbled,

283
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Denying our thirsts.

284
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
But always we scrabbled

285
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
to lie with her first.

286
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Absent, we missed her,

287
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
grew haggard and limp.

288
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Toyed with her sister,

289
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
or threatened her pimp.

290
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Came word out of Babel, the lady returns!

291
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
And there on the table we took her, in turns.

292
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Sensing the power that tyranny craves,

293
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
There in that hour, she made us her slaves.

294
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Many there were, to covet her kiss.

295
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
My shame as a spur,

296
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
I fled the abyss.

297
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
But only just.

298
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.73,000 --> 0:00:15,000
David Biello: So Victor, what have you been up to?

2
0:00:17.042,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Victor Vescovo: That's the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean,

3
0:00:19.708,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and I guess I read too much Jules Verne as a young boy,

4
0:00:22.708,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and so for the last four years I've led a team to design and build

5
0:00:26.583,000 --> 0:00:29,000
what is now the most advanced and deepest diving submersible on the planet,

6
0:00:30.167,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and I have the ability to personally pilot it too.

7
0:00:32.833,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So this was us in December of last year,

8
0:00:35.125,000 --> 0:00:37,000
for the first time -- the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.

9
0:00:37.792,000 --> 0:00:38,000
DB: And nobody's seen that before right?

10
0:00:39.75,000 --> 0:00:4,000
That's just you. VV: No.

11
0:00:41.5,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Well, now everybody else.

12
0:00:42.917,000 --> 0:00:44,000
DB: Who does that?

13
0:00:45.458,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Like --

14
0:00:46.75,000 --> 0:00:49,000
VV: Well, I think everyone has seen the developments in the last 10, 15 years.

15
0:00:50.5,000 --> 0:00:53,000
You have a bunch of people that have the means to explore outer space,

16
0:00:53.917,000 --> 0:00:55,000
like SpaceX or Blue Origin --

17
0:00:56.292,000 --> 0:00:57,000
those guys --

18
0:00:57.583,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and we're going the other direction.

19
0:00:59.375,000 --> 0:01:,000
So it's a wonderful era

20
0:01:00.667,000 --> 0:01:02,000
of private individuals spending their resources

21
0:01:02.917,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to develop technologies that can take us to places

22
0:01:05.292,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that have never been explored before,

23
0:01:07.125,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and the oceans of the world is --

24
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:12,000
it's almost a cliché to say it's 70 percent of our entire planet,

25
0:01:12.708,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and of that, 95 percent is unexplored.

26
0:01:15.167,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So what we're trying to do with our expedition

27
0:01:17.5,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is to build and prove out a submersible

28
0:01:19.417,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that can go to any point on the bottom of the planet

29
0:01:22.125,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to explore the 60 percent of this planet that is still unexplored.

30
0:01:27.208,000 --> 0:01:29,000
DB: You need a pretty cool tool to do that, right?

31
0:01:29.583,000 --> 0:01:3,000
VV: Right.

32
0:01:30.875,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now the tool is the submarine, the Limiting Factor.

33
0:01:33.5,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It's a state-of-the-art vessel

34
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:37,000
supported by the support ship, the Pressure Drop.

35
0:01:37.478,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It has a two-person titanium sphere, 90 millimeters-thick,

36
0:01:40.292,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that keeps it at one atmosphere,

37
0:01:41.917,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and it has the ability to dive repeatedly

38
0:01:44.625,000 --> 0:01:46,000
down to the very deepest point of the ocean.

39
0:01:47.167,000 --> 0:01:51,000
DB: So like the SpaceX of ocean exploration?

40
0:01:51.375,000 --> 0:01:53,000
VV: Yeah, it's kind of the SpaceX of ocean exploration,

41
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:55,000
but I pilot my own vehicles.

42
0:01:55.708,000 --> 0:01:56,000
(Laughter)

43
0:01:57.583,000 --> 0:02:,000
DB: Are you going to take Elon or...?

44
0:02:00.75,000 --> 0:02:02,000
VV: Yeah, I could take someone down there.

45
0:02:02.833,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So, Elon, if you're listening,

46
0:02:04.333,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I'll give you a ride in mine if you give me a ride in yours.

47
0:02:07.208,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:10.125,000 --> 0:02:12,000
DB: So tell us what it's like down there.

49
0:02:12.875,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I mean, we're talking about a place where the pressure is so intense

50
0:02:16.292,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that it's like putting an Eiffel Tower on your toe.

51
0:02:18.75,000 --> 0:02:19,000
VV: It's more than that.

52
0:02:20.083,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It's about 16,000 psi.

53
0:02:21.542,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So the issue is that we have this titanium sphere

54
0:02:23.958,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that allows us to go down to these extreme depths

55
0:02:26.417,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and come up repeatedly.

56
0:02:28.083,000 --> 0:02:29,000
That's never been done before.

57
0:02:29.583,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The Challenger Deep has been dived twice,

58
0:02:31.667,000 --> 0:02:34,000
once in 1960 and once in 2012 by James Cameron,

59
0:02:34.958,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and they went down and came back up and those were experimental craft.

60
0:02:38.292,000 --> 0:02:4,000
This is the first commercially certified submersible

61
0:02:40.792,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that can go up and down thousands of times with two people,

62
0:02:44.042,000 --> 0:02:45,000
including a scientist.

63
0:02:45.333,000 --> 0:02:46,000
We're very proud that we took down

64
0:02:47.208,000 --> 0:02:49,000
the deepest-diving British citizen in history

65
0:02:49.417,000 --> 0:02:51,000
just three weeks ago, Dr. Alan Jamieson of Newcastle University

66
0:02:52.417,000 --> 0:02:54,000
who was down with us on the Java Trench.

67
0:02:55.042,000 --> 0:02:59,000
DB: So, not too much freaks you out, is what I'm guessing.

68
0:02:59.958,000 --> 0:03:01,000
VV: Well, it's a lot different to go diving.

69
0:03:02.083,000 --> 0:03:05,000
If you're claustrophobic, you do not want to be in the submarine.

70
0:03:05.208,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We go down quite a distance

71
0:03:06.583,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and the missions typically last eight to nine hours in a confined space.

72
0:03:10.042,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It's very different from the career I had previously

73
0:03:12.542,000 --> 0:03:14,000
which was mountain climbing where you're in open spaces,

74
0:03:15.208,000 --> 0:03:16,000
the wind is whipping, it's very cold.

75
0:03:17.042,000 --> 0:03:19,000
This is the opposite. It's much more technical.

76
0:03:19.292,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It's much more about precision in using the instruments

77
0:03:21.917,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and troubleshooting anything that can go wrong.

78
0:03:24.167,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But if something really goes wrong in the submersible,

79
0:03:26.75,000 --> 0:03:27,000
you're not going to know it.

80
0:03:28.167,000 --> 0:03:29,000
(Laughter)

81
0:03:29.5,000 --> 0:03:31,000
DB: So you're afraid of leaks is what you're saying.

82
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
VV: Leaks are not good, but if it's a leak that's happening,

83
0:03:34.875,000 --> 0:03:36,000
it's not that bad because if it was really bad

84
0:03:37.083,000 --> 0:03:38,000
you wouldn't know it, again, but --

85
0:03:38.833,000 --> 0:03:4,000
you know, fire in the capsule, that wouldn't be good either,

86
0:03:41.708,000 --> 0:03:43,000
but it's actually a very safe submersible.

87
0:03:43.792,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I like to say I don't trust a lot of things in life,

88
0:03:46.292,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but I do trust titanium, I trust math

89
0:03:48.125,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and I trust finite element analysis,

90
0:03:50.208,000 --> 0:03:51,000
which is how you figure out

91
0:03:51.542,000 --> 0:03:53,000
whether or not things like this can survive

92
0:03:53.625,000 --> 0:03:55,000
these extraordinary pressures and conditions.

93
0:03:55.792,000 --> 0:03:58,000
DB: And that sphere is so perfectly machined, right?

94
0:03:58.958,000 --> 0:03:59,000
This is a truly unique craft.

95
0:04:00.958,000 --> 0:04:01,000
VV: That was the real trick --

96
0:04:02.458,000 --> 0:04:03,000
is actually building a titanium sphere

97
0:04:04.333,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that was accurate to within .1 percent of machine.

98
0:04:07.5,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Titanium is a hard metal to work

99
0:04:09.083,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and a lot of people haven't figured it out,

100
0:04:11.167,000 --> 0:04:12,000
but we were very fortunate.

101
0:04:12.542,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Our extraordinary team was able to make an almost perfect sphere,

102
0:04:15.667,000 --> 0:04:17,000
which when you're subjecting something to pressure,

103
0:04:18.125,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that's the strongest geometry you can have.

104
0:04:20.208,000 --> 0:04:22,000
When I'm in the submersible and that hatch closes,

105
0:04:22.625,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I'm confident that I'm going to go down and come back up.

106
0:04:25.375,000 --> 0:04:27,000
DB: And that's the thing you double-check --

107
0:04:27.5,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that the hatch is closed?

108
0:04:28.833,000 --> 0:04:3,000
VV: There are only two rules in diving a submarine.

109
0:04:31.291,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Number one is close the hatch securely.

110
0:04:33.208,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Number two is go back to rule number one.

111
0:04:35.208,000 --> 0:04:38,000
DB: Alright so, Atlantic Ocean: check.

112
0:04:38.625,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Southern Ocean: check.

113
0:04:40.417,000 --> 0:04:42,000
VV: No one has ever dived the Southern Ocean before.

114
0:04:42.917,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I know why.

115
0:04:44.25,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It's really, really hostile.

116
0:04:45.667,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The weather is awful.

117
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The word collision comes to mind.

118
0:04:49.25,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But we did that one, yes.

119
0:04:51.125,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Glad that's over -- DB: Yeah --

120
0:04:52.667,000 --> 0:04:53,000
VV: Thank you.

121
0:04:54.042,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Applause)

122
0:04:55.208,000 --> 0:04:56,000
DB: It's like you're racing through it.

123
0:04:57.125,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And now the Indian Ocean, as Kelly mentioned.

124
0:04:59.583,000 --> 0:05:,000
VV: Yeah, that was three weeks ago.

125
0:05:01.333,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We were fortunate enough to actually solve the mystery.

126
0:05:03.958,000 --> 0:05:04,000
If someone had asked me three weeks ago,

127
0:05:05.917,000 --> 0:05:07,000
"What is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean?" --

128
0:05:08.375,000 --> 0:05:09,000
no one really knew.

129
0:05:09.667,000 --> 0:05:1,000
There were two candidates,

130
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:13,000
one off of Western Australia and one in the Java Trench.

131
0:05:13.667,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We have this wonderful ship with a brilliant sonar.

132
0:05:16.125,000 --> 0:05:17,000
We mapped both of them.

133
0:05:17.417,000 --> 0:05:19,000
We sent landers down to the bottom and verified.

134
0:05:19.708,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It's actually in the center portion of the Java Trench,

135
0:05:22.333,000 --> 0:05:23,000
which is where no one thought it was.

136
0:05:24.167,000 --> 0:05:26,000
In fact, every time we've completed one of our major dives,

137
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:29,000
we have to run off to Wikipedia and change it

138
0:05:29.167,000 --> 0:05:3,000
because it's completely wrong.

139
0:05:30.667,000 --> 0:05:31,000
(Laughter)

140
0:05:32.333,000 --> 0:05:35,000
DB: So it probably takes longer to get down there

141
0:05:35.417,000 --> 0:05:37,000
than the time you're able to spend down there?

142
0:05:37.708,000 --> 0:05:39,000
VV: No, we actually spend quite a bit of time.

143
0:05:40.625,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I have four days of oxygen supply in the vessel.

144
0:05:43.5,000 --> 0:05:44,000
If I'm down there for four days,

145
0:05:45.083,000 --> 0:05:47,000
something's gone so wrong I'm probably not going to use it,

146
0:05:47.917,000 --> 0:05:5,000
but it's about three hours down to the deepest part of the ocean

147
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and then we can spend usually three or four hours

148
0:05:53.333,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and then another three hours up.

149
0:05:54.917,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So you don't want to stay in there for more than 10 or 11 hours.

150
0:05:58,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It can get a little tight.

151
0:05:59.333,000 --> 0:06:01,000
DB: Alright, so the bottom of the Indian Ocean.

152
0:06:01.583,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And this is something that no one besides you has ever seen before --

153
0:06:05.875,000 --> 0:06:09,000
VV: This is actually imagery from one of our robotic landers.

154
0:06:09.917,000 --> 0:06:11,000
On the bottom right you can actually see a robust assfish --

155
0:06:12.875,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that's what it's actually called.

156
0:06:14.5,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Laughter)

157
0:06:15.542,000 --> 0:06:18,000
But you can see from the left a creature that's never been seen before.

158
0:06:18.958,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It's actually a bottom-dwelling jellyfish called a stalked ascidian,

159
0:06:22.208,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and none of them have ever looked like this before.

160
0:06:24.667,000 --> 0:06:26,000
It actually has a small child at the bottom of its stalk,

161
0:06:27.417,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and it just drifted across beautifully.

162
0:06:29.583,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So every single dive we have gone on,

163
0:06:32.083,000 --> 0:06:34,000
even though we're only down there for a couple of hours,

164
0:06:34.75,000 --> 0:06:35,000
we have found three or four new species

165
0:06:36.667,000 --> 0:06:39,000
because these are places that have been isolated for billions of years

166
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and no human being has ever been down there to film them

167
0:06:43.375,000 --> 0:06:44,000
or take samples.

168
0:06:44.667,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And so this is extraordinary for us --

169
0:06:46.542,000 --> 0:06:48,000
(Applause)

170
0:06:48.917,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So what we are hoping --

171
0:06:50.25,000 --> 0:06:53,000
the main objective of our mission is to build this tool.

172
0:06:53.625,000 --> 0:06:54,000
This tool is a door,

173
0:06:55.292,000 --> 0:06:56,000
because with this tool,

174
0:06:56.625,000 --> 0:06:58,000
we'll be able to make more of them potentially

175
0:06:58.833,000 --> 0:07:,000
and take scientists down to do thousands of dives,

176
0:07:01.208,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to open that door to exploration

177
0:07:03.458,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and find things that we had no idea even existed.

178
0:07:06.542,000 --> 0:07:1,000
DB: And so more people have been to space than the bottom of the ocean.

179
0:07:11.458,000 --> 0:07:12,000
You're one of three.

180
0:07:13.125,000 --> 0:07:15,000
You're going to up that number, you're going to give it away.

181
0:07:16.042,000 --> 0:07:19,000
VV: Yeah, three people have dived to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.

182
0:07:19.333,000 --> 0:07:21,000
The USS Trieste in 1960 with two individuals.

183
0:07:21.5,000 --> 0:07:23,000
James Cameron in 2012 with his Deep Sea Challenger --

184
0:07:24.042,000 --> 0:07:25,000
thank you, Jim, great sub.

185
0:07:25.625,000 --> 0:07:26,000
This is a third-generation technology.

186
0:07:27.5,000 --> 0:07:29,000
We're not only going to try and go down, actually in two weeks,

187
0:07:30.5,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but we're going to try and do it multiple times,

188
0:07:32.792,000 --> 0:07:33,000
which has never been done before.

189
0:07:34.417,000 --> 0:07:36,000
If we can do that, we'll have proven the technology

190
0:07:36.875,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and that door will not just go open, it will stay open.

191
0:07:39.5,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Applause)

192
0:07:42.792,000 --> 0:07:43,000
DB: Fantastic. Good luck.

193
0:07:44.125,000 --> 0:07:45,000
VV: Thank you very much. DB: Thank you.

194
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:47,000
VV: Thank you all.

195
0:07:47.292,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Applause)

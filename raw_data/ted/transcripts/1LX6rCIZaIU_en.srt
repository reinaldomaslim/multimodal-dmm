1
0:00:12.542,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Who doesn't love efficiency?

2
0:00:14.75,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I do.

3
0:00:16.042,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Efficiency means more for less.

4
0:00:19.417,000 --> 0:00:22,000
More miles per gallon, more light per watt,

5
0:00:23.333,000 --> 0:00:24,000
more words per minute.

6
0:00:25.917,000 --> 0:00:27,000
More for less is the next best thing

7
0:00:28.417,000 --> 0:00:29,000
to something for nothing.

8
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Algorithms, big data, the cloud are giving us more for less.

9
0:00:36.083,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Are we heading toward a friction-free utopia

10
0:00:39.75,000 --> 0:00:41,000
or toward a nightmare of surveillance?

11
0:00:42.583,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I don't know.

12
0:00:43.875,000 --> 0:00:44,000
My interest is in the present.

13
0:00:46.208,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And I'd like to show you

14
0:00:48.333,000 --> 0:00:51,000
how the past can help us understand the present.

15
0:00:52.333,000 --> 0:00:54,000
There's nothing that summarizes

16
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:57,000
both the promise and the danger of efficiency

17
0:00:57.792,000 --> 0:00:58,000
like the humble potato.

18
0:00:59.792,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The potato originated in the Andes

19
0:01:02.333,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and it spread to Europe from the ancient Inca.

20
0:01:07.5,000 --> 0:01:11,000
The potato is a masterpiece of balanced nutrition.

21
0:01:13.458,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And it had some very powerful friends.

22
0:01:16.792,000 --> 0:01:18,000
King Frederick the Great of Prussia

23
0:01:19.5,000 --> 0:01:22,000
was the first enthusiast.

24
0:01:22.667,000 --> 0:01:24,000
He believed that the potato could help

25
0:01:25.042,000 --> 0:01:28,000
increase the population of healthy Prussians.

26
0:01:28.167,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And the more healthy Prussians,

27
0:01:31.458,000 --> 0:01:33,000
the more healthy Prussian soldiers.

28
0:01:34.208,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And some of those healthy Prussian soldiers

29
0:01:36.542,000 --> 0:01:39,000
captured a French military pharmacist named Parmentier.

30
0:01:41.292,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Parmentier, at first, was appalled

31
0:01:43.833,000 --> 0:01:46,000
by the morning, noon and night diet

32
0:01:47.625,000 --> 0:01:5,000
fed to POWs of potatoes,

33
0:01:51.208,000 --> 0:01:52,000
but he came to enjoy it.

34
0:01:53.208,000 --> 0:01:56,000
He thought they were making him a healthier person.

35
0:01:56.542,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And so, when he was released,

36
0:01:58.333,000 --> 0:02:02,000
he took it on himself to spread the potato to France.

37
0:02:03.333,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And he had some powerful friends.

38
0:02:05.833,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Benjamin Franklin advised him to hold a banquet,

39
0:02:10.667,000 --> 0:02:13,000
at which every dish included potatoes.

40
0:02:15.083,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And Franklin was a guest of honor.

41
0:02:18.25,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Even the king and queen of France

42
0:02:20.167,000 --> 0:02:24,000
were persuaded to wear potatoes,

43
0:02:24.333,000 --> 0:02:25,000
potato flowers, pardon me.

44
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:27.292,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The king wore a potato flower in his lapel,

46
0:02:31.792,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and the queen wore a potato flower in her hair.

47
0:02:35.792,000 --> 0:02:38,000
That was a truly great public relations idea.

48
0:02:39.667,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But there was a catch.

49
0:02:41.5,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The potato was too efficient for Europe's good.

50
0:02:45.083,000 --> 0:02:47,000
In Ireland, it seemed a miracle.

51
0:02:47.417,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Potatoes flourished, the population grew.

52
0:02:50.583,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But there was a hidden risk.

53
0:02:52.542,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Ireland's potatoes were genetically identical.

54
0:02:55.875,000 --> 0:02:58,000
They were a very efficient breed, called the Lumper.

55
0:02:59.667,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And the problem with the Lumper

56
0:03:02.042,000 --> 0:03:05,000
was that a blight from South America

57
0:03:05.917,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that affected one potato

58
0:03:07.625,000 --> 0:03:08,000
would affect them all.

59
0:03:09.958,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Britain's exploitation and callousness played a role,

60
0:03:13.458,000 --> 0:03:16,000
but it was because of this monoculture

61
0:03:16.833,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that a million people died

62
0:03:19.208,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and another two million were forced to emigrate.

63
0:03:23.542,000 --> 0:03:25,000
A plant that was supposed to end famine

64
0:03:26.083,000 --> 0:03:28,000
created one of the most tragic ones.

65
0:03:29.75,000 --> 0:03:3,000
The problems of efficiency today

66
0:03:31.667,000 --> 0:03:33,000
are less drastic but more chronic.

67
0:03:34.208,000 --> 0:03:35,000
They can also prolong the evils

68
0:03:36.208,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that they were intended to solve.

69
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Take the electronic medical records.

70
0:03:40.292,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It seemed to be the answer to the problem of doctors' handwriting,

71
0:03:44.375,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and it had the benefit

72
0:03:45.958,000 --> 0:03:48,000
of providing much better data for treatments.

73
0:03:49.292,000 --> 0:03:51,000
In practice, instead, it has meant

74
0:03:51.417,000 --> 0:03:52,000
much more electronic paperwork

75
0:03:53.25,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and physicians are now complaining that they have less,

76
0:03:56.542,000 --> 0:04:,000
rather than more time to see patients individually.

77
0:04:01.75,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The obsession with efficiency can actually make us less efficient.

78
0:04:06.292,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Efficiency also bites back with false positives.

79
0:04:09.542,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Hospitals have hundreds of devices registering alarms.

80
0:04:13.25,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Too often, they're crying wolf.

81
0:04:15.333,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It takes time to rule those out.

82
0:04:17.292,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And that time results in fatigue, stress and, once more,

83
0:04:22.208,000 --> 0:04:25,000
the neglect of the problems of real patients.

84
0:04:26.625,000 --> 0:04:29,000
There are also false positives in pattern recognition.

85
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:32,000
A school bus, viewed from the wrong angle,

86
0:04:32.167,000 --> 0:04:34,000
can resemble a punching bag.

87
0:04:35.083,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So precious time is required

88
0:04:37.333,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to eliminate misidentification.

89
0:04:40.292,000 --> 0:04:42,000
False negatives are a problem, too.

90
0:04:42.917,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Algorithms can learn a lot -- fast.

91
0:04:45.708,000 --> 0:04:47,000
But they can tell us only about the past.

92
0:04:48.5,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So many future classics get bad reviews, like "Moby Dick,"

93
0:04:53.625,000 --> 0:04:55,000
or are turned down by multiple publishers,

94
0:04:55.833,000 --> 0:04:56,000
like the "Harry Potter" series.

95
0:04:57.667,000 --> 0:05:01,000
It can be wasteful to try to avoid all waste.

96
0:05:02.042,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Efficiency is also a trap when the opposition copies it.

97
0:05:05.75,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Take the late 19th-century

98
0:05:07.917,000 --> 0:05:1,000
French 75-millimeter artillery piece.

99
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It was a masterpiece of lethal design.

100
0:05:13.958,000 --> 0:05:17,000
This piece could fire a shell every four seconds.

101
0:05:18.208,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But that wasn't so unusual.

102
0:05:19.583,000 --> 0:05:23,000
What was really brilliant was that because of the recoil mechanism,

103
0:05:23.75,000 --> 0:05:25,000
it could return to the exact same position

104
0:05:26.625,000 --> 0:05:27,000
without having to be reaimed.

105
0:05:28.167,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So the effective rate of firing was drastically increased.

106
0:05:32.042,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Now, this seemed to be a way for France

107
0:05:34.583,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to defeat Germany the next time they fought.

108
0:05:39.042,000 --> 0:05:42,000
But, predictably, the Germans were working

109
0:05:42.417,000 --> 0:05:43,000
on something very similar.

110
0:05:44.083,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So when the First World War broke out,

111
0:05:46.417,000 --> 0:05:48,000
the result was the trench warfare

112
0:05:49.375,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that lasted longer than anybody had expected.

113
0:05:52.833,000 --> 0:05:56,000
A technology that was designed to shorten the war, prolonged it.

114
0:05:58.125,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The biggest cost of all may be missed opportunities.

115
0:06:01.75,000 --> 0:06:04,000
The platform economy connecting buyers and sellers

116
0:06:05.417,000 --> 0:06:06,000
can be a great investment,

117
0:06:06.917,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and we have seen that in the last few weeks.

118
0:06:09.875,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Companies that are still losing hundreds of millions of dollars

119
0:06:13.458,000 --> 0:06:16,000
may be creating billionaires with initial public offerings.

120
0:06:18.875,000 --> 0:06:21,000
But the really difficult inventions

121
0:06:22.167,000 --> 0:06:24,000
are the physical and chemical ones.

122
0:06:24.75,000 --> 0:06:26,000
They mean bigger risks.

123
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:3,000
They may be losing out, because hardware is hard.

124
0:06:30.333,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It's much harder to scale up a physical or chemical invention

125
0:06:34.542,000 --> 0:06:36,000
than it is a software-based invention.

126
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Think of batteries.

127
0:06:39.5,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Lithium-ion batteries in portable devices and electric cars

128
0:06:43.667,000 --> 0:06:45,000
are based on a 30-year-old principle.

129
0:06:47.042,000 --> 0:06:49,000
How many smartphone batteries today

130
0:06:49.5,000 --> 0:06:52,000
will last a full day on a single charge?

131
0:06:53.542,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Yes, hardware is hard.

132
0:06:56.583,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It took over 20 years for the patent

133
0:06:59.583,000 --> 0:07:01,000
on the principle of dry photocopying,

134
0:07:01.958,000 --> 0:07:04,000
by Chester Carlson in 1938,

135
0:07:05.167,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to result in the Xerox 914 copier introduced in 1959.

136
0:07:12.958,000 --> 0:07:16,000
The small, brave company, Haloid in Rochester, NY

137
0:07:17.958,000 --> 0:07:21,000
had to go through what most corporations would never have tolerated.

138
0:07:22.917,000 --> 0:07:23,000
There was one failure after another,

139
0:07:24.75,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and one of the special problems was fire.

140
0:07:28.042,000 --> 0:07:31,000
In fact, when the 914 was finally released,

141
0:07:31.875,000 --> 0:07:35,000
it still had a device that was called a scorch eliminator

142
0:07:36.792,000 --> 0:07:4,000
but actually it was a small fire extinguisher built in.

143
0:07:42.167,000 --> 0:07:46,000
My answer to all these questions is: inspired inefficiency.

144
0:07:46.833,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Data and measurement are essential, but they're not enough.

145
0:07:50.917,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Let's leave room for human intuition and human skills.

146
0:07:54.875,000 --> 0:07:57,000
There are seven facets of inspired inefficiency.

147
0:07:58.708,000 --> 0:08:01,000
First, take the scenic route, say yes to serendipity.

148
0:08:02.5,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Wrong turns can be productive.

149
0:08:05.083,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Once, when I was exploring the east bank of the Mississippi,

150
0:08:08.208,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I took the wrong turn.

151
0:08:10.208,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I was approaching a toll bridge crossing the great river,

152
0:08:13.917,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and the toll collector said I could not turn back.

153
0:08:17.417,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So I paid my 50 cents -- that's all it was at the time --

154
0:08:20.875,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and I was in Muscatine, Iowa.

155
0:08:24.208,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I had barely heard of Muscatine,

156
0:08:26.125,000 --> 0:08:29,000
but it proved to be a fascinating place.

157
0:08:29.292,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Muscatine had some of the world's richest mussel beds.

158
0:08:33.625,000 --> 0:08:36,000
A century ago, a third of the world's buttons

159
0:08:36.75,000 --> 0:08:37,000
were produced in Muscatine,

160
0:08:38.583,000 --> 0:08:4,000
1.5 billion a year.

161
0:08:41.167,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The last plants have closed now,

162
0:08:43.458,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but there is still a museum of the pearl button industry

163
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that's one of the most unusual in the world.

164
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:51,000
But buttons were only the beginning.

165
0:08:51.833,000 --> 0:08:52,000
This is the house in Muscatine

166
0:08:53.75,000 --> 0:08:56,000
where China's future president stayed in 1986,

167
0:08:56.833,000 --> 0:08:58,000
as a member of an agricultural delegation.

168
0:08:59.542,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It is now the Sino-US Friendship House,

169
0:09:02.667,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and it's a pilgrimage site for Chinese tourists.

170
0:09:05.792,000 --> 0:09:06,000
How could I have foreseen that?

171
0:09:07.542,000 --> 0:09:08,000
(Laughter)

172
0:09:09.958,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Second, get up from the couch.

173
0:09:13.625,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Sometimes it can be more efficient

174
0:09:15.833,000 --> 0:09:16,000
to do things the hard way.

175
0:09:17.417,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Consider the internet of things.

176
0:09:19.375,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It's wonderful to be able to control lights,

177
0:09:22.042,000 --> 0:09:24,000
set the thermostat, even vacuum the room

178
0:09:25.042,000 --> 0:09:26,000
without leaving one's seat.

179
0:09:26.917,000 --> 0:09:28,000
But medical research has shown

180
0:09:29.167,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that actually fidgeting, getting up, walking around

181
0:09:32.417,000 --> 0:09:35,000
is one of the best things you can do for your heart.

182
0:09:35.625,000 --> 0:09:37,000
It's good for the heart and the waistline.

183
0:09:38.917,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Third, monetize your mistakes.

184
0:09:41.958,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Great forms can be created

185
0:09:43.708,000 --> 0:09:46,000
by imaginative development of accidents.

186
0:09:46.875,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Tad Leski, an architect of the Metropolitan Opera

187
0:09:49.833,000 --> 0:09:5,000
at Lincoln Center,

188
0:09:51.125,000 --> 0:09:54,000
was working on a sketch and some white ink fell on the drawing.

189
0:09:56.125,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Other people might just have thrown it away,

190
0:09:59.083,000 --> 0:10:03,000
but Leski was inspired to produce a starburst chandelier

191
0:10:03.917,000 --> 0:10:07,000
that was probably the most notable of its kind of the 20th century.

192
0:10:09.292,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Fourth, sometimes try the hard way.

193
0:10:12.208,000 --> 0:10:15,000
It can be more efficient to be less fluent.

194
0:10:15.583,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Psychologists call this desirable difficulty.

195
0:10:18.417,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Taking detailed notes with a keyboard

196
0:10:20.875,000 --> 0:10:23,000
would seem to be the best way to grasp what a lecturer is saying,

197
0:10:24.333,000 --> 0:10:27,000
to be able to review it verbatim.

198
0:10:27.5,000 --> 0:10:3,000
However, studies have shown that when we have to abbreviate,

199
0:10:31.5,000 --> 0:10:34,000
when we have to summarize what a speaker is saying,

200
0:10:34.583,000 --> 0:10:38,000
when we're taking notes with a pen or a pencil on paper,

201
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:4,000
we're processing that information.

202
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We're making that our own,

203
0:10:42.875,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and we are learning much more actively

204
0:10:45.208,000 --> 0:10:48,000
than when we were just transcribing

205
0:10:48.958,000 --> 0:10:49,000
what was being said.

206
0:10:50.833,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Fifth, get security through diversity.

207
0:10:53.583,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Monoculture can be deadly.

208
0:10:55.125,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Remember the potato?

209
0:10:56.583,000 --> 0:10:58,000
It was efficient until it wasn't.

210
0:10:58.667,000 --> 0:11:,000
Diversity applies to organizations, too.

211
0:11:02.042,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Software can tell what has made people in an organization succeed in the past.

212
0:11:07.75,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And it's useful, sometimes, in screening employees.

213
0:11:10.917,000 --> 0:11:14,000
But remember, the environment is constantly changing,

214
0:11:15.042,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and software, screening software, has no way to tell,

215
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and we have no way to tell,

216
0:11:20.458,000 --> 0:11:23,000
who is going to be useful in the future.

217
0:11:23.958,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So, we need to supplement whatever the algorithm tells us

218
0:11:28.833,000 --> 0:11:3,000
by an intuition and by looking for people

219
0:11:31.75,000 --> 0:11:34,000
with various backgrounds and various outlooks.

220
0:11:35.25,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Sixth, achieve safety through redundancy and human skills.

221
0:11:39.708,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Why did two 737 Max aircraft crash?

222
0:11:43.292,000 --> 0:11:45,000
We still don't know the full story,

223
0:11:45.417,000 --> 0:11:47,000
but we know how to prevent future tragedies.

224
0:11:48.25,000 --> 0:11:5,000
We need multiple independent systems.

225
0:11:50.875,000 --> 0:11:54,000
If one fails, then the others can override it.

226
0:11:54.917,000 --> 0:11:57,000
We also need skilled operators to come to the rescue

227
0:11:58.375,000 --> 0:12:,000
and that means constant training.

228
0:12:00.958,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Seventh, be rationally extravagant.

229
0:12:04.167,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Thomas Edison was a pioneer of the film industry,

230
0:12:06.875,000 --> 0:12:08,000
as well as of camera technology.

231
0:12:09.292,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Nobody has done more for efficiency than Thomas Edison.

232
0:12:13.292,000 --> 0:12:14,000
But his cost cutting broke down.

233
0:12:15.958,000 --> 0:12:17,000
His manager hired a so-called efficiency engineer,

234
0:12:18.958,000 --> 0:12:2,000
who advised him to save money

235
0:12:21.292,000 --> 0:12:24,000
by using more of the film stock that he'd shot,

236
0:12:24.875,000 --> 0:12:25,000
having fewer retakes.

237
0:12:26.583,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Well, Edison was a genius,

238
0:12:27.875,000 --> 0:12:3,000
but he didn't understand the new rules of feature films

239
0:12:31.333,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and the fact that failure was becoming the price of success.

240
0:12:36.708,000 --> 0:12:39,000
On the other hand, some great directors, like Erich Von Stroheim,

241
0:12:40.125,000 --> 0:12:41,000
were the opposite.

242
0:12:41.417,000 --> 0:12:42,000
They were superb dramatists,

243
0:12:42.833,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and Stroheim was also a memorable actor.

244
0:12:46.125,000 --> 0:12:48,000
But they couldn't live within their budgets.

245
0:12:48.292,000 --> 0:12:49,000
So that was not sustainable.

246
0:12:51.208,000 --> 0:12:54,000
It was Irving Thalberg, a former secretary with intuitive genius,

247
0:12:55.208,000 --> 0:12:57,000
who achieved rational extravagance.

248
0:12:57.583,000 --> 0:13:,000
First at Universal, and then at MGM,

249
0:13:00.625,000 --> 0:13:04,000
becoming the ideal of the Hollywood producer.

250
0:13:04.833,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Summing up, to be truly efficient,

251
0:13:08.125,000 --> 0:13:1,000
we need optimal inefficiency.

252
0:13:10.667,000 --> 0:13:12,000
The shortest path may be a curve

253
0:13:13.292,000 --> 0:13:15,000
rather than a straight line.

254
0:13:15.458,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Charles Darwin understood that.

255
0:13:17.667,000 --> 0:13:18,000
When he encountered a tough problem,

256
0:13:19.458,000 --> 0:13:2,000
he made a circuit of a trail,

257
0:13:21.25,000 --> 0:13:23,000
the sandwalk that he'd built behind his house.

258
0:13:24.875,000 --> 0:13:27,000
A productive path can be physical, like Darwin's,

259
0:13:28.125,000 --> 0:13:31,000
or a virtual one, or an unforeseen detour

260
0:13:31.583,000 --> 0:13:33,000
from a path we had laid out.

261
0:13:34.083,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Too much efficiency can weaken itself.

262
0:13:36.542,000 --> 0:13:4,000
But a bit of inspired inefficiency can strengthen it.

263
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Sometimes, the best way to move forward

264
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:46,000
is to follow a circle.

265
0:13:46.875,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Thank you.

266
0:13:48.208,000 --> 0:13:5,000
(Applause)

0:00:15.62,000 --> 0:00:19,000
In half a century of trying to help prevent wars,

3
0:00:19.754,000 --> 0:00:22,000
there's one question that never leaves me:

4
0:00:23.285,000 --> 0:00:26,000
How do we deal with extreme violence

5
0:00:26.985,000 --> 0:00:29,000
without using force in return?

6
0:00:30.486,000 --> 0:00:32,000
When you're faced with brutality,

7
0:00:33.037,000 --> 0:00:35,000
whether it's a child facing a bully on a playground

8
0:00:35.953,000 --> 0:00:36,000
or domestic violence --

9
0:00:37.653,000 --> 0:00:39,000
or, on the streets of Syria today,

10
0:00:40.569,000 --> 0:00:42,000
facing tanks and shrapnel,

11
0:00:43.12,000 --> 0:00:46,000
what's the most effective thing to do?

12
0:00:46.467,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Fight back? Give in?

13
0:00:49.065,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Use more force?

14
0:00:52.436,000 --> 0:00:55,000
This question: "How do I deal with a bully

15
0:00:56.398,000 --> 0:00:59,000
without becoming a thug in return?"

16
0:01:00.148,000 --> 0:01:03,000
has been with me ever since I was a child.

17
0:01:03.164,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I remember I was about 13,

18
0:01:05.715,000 --> 0:01:09,000
glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents' living room

19
0:01:10.701,000 --> 0:01:14,000
as Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest,

20
0:01:14.966,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and kids not much older than me

21
0:01:17.765,000 --> 0:01:19,000
were throwing themselves at the tanks

22
0:01:20.266,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and getting mown down.

23
0:01:22.434,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And I rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase.

24
0:01:26.235,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And my mother came up and said, "What on Earth are you doing?"

25
0:01:28.949,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And I said, "I'm going to Budapest."

26
0:01:31.231,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And she said, "What on Earth for?"

27
0:01:33.865,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And I said, "Kids are getting killed there.

28
0:01:35.914,000 --> 0:01:36,000
There's something terrible happening."

29
0:01:37.766,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And she said, "Don't be so silly."

30
0:01:39.783,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And I started to cry.

31
0:01:42.383,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And she got it, she said,

32
0:01:44.598,000 --> 0:01:45,000
"Okay, I see it's serious.

33
0:01:46.365,000 --> 0:01:48,000
You're much too young to help.

34
0:01:49.199,000 --> 0:01:51,000
You need training. I'll help you.

35
0:01:51.834,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But just unpack your suitcase."

36
0:01:53.999,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And so I got some training

37
0:01:57.565,000 --> 0:02:,000
and went and worked in Africa during most of my 20s.

38
0:02:01.498,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But I realized that what I really needed to know

39
0:02:05.199,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I couldn't get from training courses.

40
0:02:07.598,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I wanted to understand

41
0:02:09.784,000 --> 0:02:13,000
how violence, how oppression, works.

42
0:02:14.234,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And what I've discovered since is this:

43
0:02:19.182,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Bullies use violence in three ways.

44
0:02:23.248,000 --> 0:02:28,000
They use political violence to intimidate,

45
0:02:28.551,000 --> 0:02:33,000
physical violence to terrorize

46
0:02:33.965,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and mental or emotional violence to undermine.

47
0:02:41.489,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And only very rarely in very few cases

48
0:02:44.716,000 --> 0:02:47,000
does it work to use more violence.

49
0:02:48.232,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Nelson Mandela went to jail believing in violence,

50
0:02:54.441,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and 27 years later

51
0:02:56.465,000 --> 0:02:57,000
he and his colleagues

52
0:02:58.448,000 --> 0:02:59,000
had slowly and carefully

53
0:03:00.433,000 --> 0:03:04,000
honed the skills, the incredible skills, that they needed

54
0:03:05.399,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known

55
0:03:09.599,000 --> 0:03:1,000
into a democracy.

56
0:03:11.465,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And they did it in a total devotion to non-violence.

57
0:03:16.197,000 --> 0:03:23,000
They realized that using force against force

58
0:03:23.364,000 --> 0:03:28,000
doesn't work.

59
0:03:28.56,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So what does work?

60
0:03:30.753,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Over time I've collected about a half-dozen methods

61
0:03:34.222,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that do work -- of course there are many more --

62
0:03:36.055,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that do work and that are effective.

63
0:03:38.401,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And the first is

64
0:03:39.768,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that the change that has to take place

65
0:03:42.286,000 --> 0:03:46,000
has to take place here, inside me.

66
0:03:46.751,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It's my response, my attitude, to oppression

67
0:03:50.851,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that I've got control over,

68
0:03:53.702,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and that I can do something about.

69
0:03:56.002,000 --> 0:04:,000
And what I need to develop is self-knowledge to do that.

70
0:04:00.185,000 --> 0:04:02,000
That means I need to know how I tick,

71
0:04:02.684,000 --> 0:04:04,000
when I collapse,

72
0:04:04.935,000 --> 0:04:08,000
where my formidable points are,

73
0:04:09.269,000 --> 0:04:11,000
where my weaker points are.

74
0:04:11.767,000 --> 0:04:12,000
When do I give in?

75
0:04:13.235,000 --> 0:04:18,000
What will I stand up for?

76
0:04:18.498,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And meditation or self-inspection

77
0:04:23.637,000 --> 0:04:25,000
is one of the ways -- again it's not the only one --

78
0:04:26.171,000 --> 0:04:27,000
it's one of the ways

79
0:04:27.289,000 --> 0:04:31,000
of gaining this kind of inner power.

80
0:04:31.406,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And my heroine here -- like Satish's --

81
0:04:33.888,000 --> 0:04:36,000
is Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma.

82
0:04:36.921,000 --> 0:04:39,000
She was leading a group of students

83
0:04:40.554,000 --> 0:04:42,000
on a protest in the streets of Rangoon.

84
0:04:42.954,000 --> 0:04:46,000
They came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns.

85
0:04:47.137,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And she realized straight away

86
0:04:48.304,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers

87
0:04:52.222,000 --> 0:04:57,000
were more scared than the student protesters behind her.

88
0:04:57.92,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But she told the students to sit down.

89
0:05:00.625,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And she walked forward with such calm and such clarity

90
0:05:07.921,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and such total lack of fear

91
0:05:11.371,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that she could walk right up to the first gun,

92
0:05:15.471,000 --> 0:05:19,000
put her hand on it and lower it.

93
0:05:23.824,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And no one got killed.

94
0:05:27.357,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So that's what the mastery of fear can do --

95
0:05:31.299,000 --> 0:05:33,000
not only faced with machine guns,

96
0:05:33.6,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but if you meet a knife fight in the street.

97
0:05:37.766,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But we have to practice.

98
0:05:40.131,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So what about our fear?

99
0:05:42.032,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I have a little mantra.

100
0:05:46.986,000 --> 0:05:49,000
My fear grows fat

101
0:05:50.427,000 --> 0:05:52,000
on the energy I feed it.

102
0:05:52.644,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And if it grows very big

103
0:05:54.931,000 --> 0:05:56,000
it probably happens.

104
0:05:57.293,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So we all know the three o'clock in the morning syndrome,

105
0:06:01.728,000 --> 0:06:03,000
when something you've been worrying about wakes you up --

106
0:06:04.444,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I see a lot of people --

107
0:06:06.834,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and for an hour you toss and turn,

108
0:06:10.444,000 --> 0:06:11,000
it gets worse and worse,

109
0:06:12.122,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and by four o'clock you're pinned to the pillow

110
0:06:15.244,000 --> 0:06:17,000
by a monster this big.

111
0:06:17.447,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The only thing to do

112
0:06:19.381,000 --> 0:06:2,000
is to get up, make a cup of tea

113
0:06:21.215,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and sit down with the fear like a child beside you.

114
0:06:26.531,000 --> 0:06:28,000
You're the adult.

115
0:06:29.012,000 --> 0:06:3,000
The fear is the child.

116
0:06:30.899,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And you talk to the fear

117
0:06:32.344,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and you ask it what it wants, what it needs.

118
0:06:35.53,000 --> 0:06:39,000
How can this be made better?

119
0:06:40.147,000 --> 0:06:41,000
How can the child feel stronger?

120
0:06:41.897,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And you make a plan.

121
0:06:43.346,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And you say, "Okay, now we're going back to sleep.

122
0:06:45.351,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Half-past seven, we're getting up and that's what we're going to do."

123
0:06:49.118,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I had one of these 3 a.m. episodes on Sunday --

124
0:06:54.866,000 --> 0:06:57,000
paralyzed with fear at coming to talk to you.

125
0:06:58.851,000 --> 0:06:59,000
(Laughter)

126
0:07:00.849,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So I did the thing.

127
0:07:02.356,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I got up, made the cup of tea, sat down with it, did it all

128
0:07:06.485,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and I'm here -- still partly paralyzed, but I'm here.

129
0:07:10.641,000 --> 0:07:14,000
(Applause)

130
0:07:15.04,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So that's fear. What about anger?

131
0:07:17.556,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Wherever there is injustice there's anger.

132
0:07:21.958,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But anger is like gasoline,

133
0:07:24.806,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match,

134
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
you've got an inferno.

135
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But anger as an engine -- in an engine -- is powerful.

136
0:07:35.377,000 --> 0:07:39,000
If we can put our anger inside an engine,

137
0:07:39.543,000 --> 0:07:4,000
it can drive us forward,

138
0:07:41.326,000 --> 0:07:43,000
it can get us through the dreadful moments

139
0:07:44.314,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and it can give us real inner power.

140
0:07:48.277,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And I learned this in my work

141
0:07:51.395,000 --> 0:07:53,000
with nuclear weapon policy-makers.

142
0:07:53.659,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Because at the beginning I was so outraged

143
0:07:56.378,000 --> 0:07:59,000
at the dangers they were exposing us to

144
0:07:59.694,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that I just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong.

145
0:08:04.828,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Totally ineffective.

146
0:08:07.361,000 --> 0:08:1,000
In order to develop a dialogue for change

147
0:08:11.11,000 --> 0:08:13,000
we have to deal with our anger.

148
0:08:13.183,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It's okay to be angry with the thing --

149
0:08:17.86,000 --> 0:08:19,000
the nuclear weapons in this case --

150
0:08:19.96,000 --> 0:08:22,000
but it is hopeless to be angry with the people.

151
0:08:23.811,000 --> 0:08:25,000
They are human beings just like us.

152
0:08:26.426,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And they're doing what they think is best.

153
0:08:29.077,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And that's the basis on which we have to talk with them.

154
0:08:33.06,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So that's the third one, anger.

155
0:08:35.977,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And it brings me to the crux

156
0:08:37.377,000 --> 0:08:4,000
of what's going on, or what I perceive as going on,

157
0:08:40.611,000 --> 0:08:41,000
in the world today,

158
0:08:41.676,000 --> 0:08:45,000
which is that last century was top-down power.

159
0:08:45.694,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It was still governments telling people what to do.

160
0:08:49.959,000 --> 0:08:51,000
This century there's a shift.

161
0:08:51.994,000 --> 0:08:54,000
It's bottom-up or grassroots power.

162
0:08:55.877,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It's like mushrooms coming through concrete.

163
0:08:59.093,000 --> 0:09:05,000
It's people joining up with people, as Bundy just said, miles away

164
0:09:05.774,000 --> 0:09:07,000
to bring about change.

165
0:09:08.047,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And Peace Direct spotted quite early on

166
0:09:12.313,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that local people in areas of very hot conflict

167
0:09:15.864,000 --> 0:09:17,000
know what to do.

168
0:09:18.3,000 --> 0:09:2,000
They know best what to do.

169
0:09:20.516,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So Peace Direct gets behind them to do that.

170
0:09:23.798,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And the kind of thing they're doing

171
0:09:25.997,000 --> 0:09:28,000
is demobilizing militias,

172
0:09:29.165,000 --> 0:09:31,000
rebuilding economies,

173
0:09:31.768,000 --> 0:09:33,000
resettling refugees,

174
0:09:34.118,000 --> 0:09:39,000
even liberating child soldiers.

175
0:09:39.619,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And they have to risk their lives almost every day

176
0:09:42.485,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to do this.

177
0:09:45.704,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And what they've realized

178
0:09:49.518,000 --> 0:09:53,000
is that using violence in the situations they operate in

179
0:09:54.451,000 --> 0:09:58,000
is not only less humane,

180
0:09:58.97,000 --> 0:10:,000
but it's less effective

181
0:10:01.105,000 --> 0:10:07,000
than using methods that connect people with people, that rebuild.

182
0:10:07.636,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And I think that the U.S. military

183
0:10:11.568,000 --> 0:10:17,000
is finally beginning to get this.

184
0:10:18.448,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Up to now their counter-terrorism policy

185
0:10:21.157,000 --> 0:10:25,000
has been to kill insurgents at almost any cost,

186
0:10:25.99,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and if civilians get in the way,

187
0:10:29.193,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that's written as "collateral damage."

188
0:10:33.459,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And this is so infuriating and humiliating

189
0:10:40.192,000 --> 0:10:42,000
for the population of Afghanistan,

190
0:10:42.542,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that it makes the recruitment for al-Qaeda very easy,

191
0:10:46.89,000 --> 0:10:49,000
when people are so disgusted by, for example,

192
0:10:50.06,000 --> 0:10:52,000
the burning of the Koran.

193
0:10:52.439,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So the training of the troops has to change.

194
0:10:55.44,000 --> 0:11:,000
And I think there are signs that it is beginning to change.

195
0:11:00.548,000 --> 0:11:02,000
The British military have always been much better at this.

196
0:11:03.332,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But there is one magnificent example for them to take their cue from,

197
0:11:09.014,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and that's a brilliant U.S. lieutenant colonel

198
0:11:12.182,000 --> 0:11:13,000
called Chris Hughes.

199
0:11:13.847,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And he was leading his men down the streets of Najaf --

200
0:11:18.064,000 --> 0:11:2,000
in Iraq actually --

201
0:11:20.232,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and suddenly people were pouring out of the houses on either side of the road,

202
0:11:25.265,000 --> 0:11:29,000
screaming, yelling, furiously angry,

203
0:11:29.863,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and surrounded these very young troops who were completely terrified,

204
0:11:34.331,000 --> 0:11:36,000
didn't know what was going on, couldn't speak Arabic.

205
0:11:36.831,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And Chris Hughes strode into the middle of the throng

206
0:11:41.081,000 --> 0:11:44,000
with his weapon above his head, pointing at the ground,

207
0:11:44.95,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and he said, "Kneel."

208
0:11:46.648,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And these huge soldiers

209
0:11:49.448,000 --> 0:11:51,000
with their backpacks and their body armor,

210
0:11:52.081,000 --> 0:11:56,000
wobbled to the ground.

211
0:11:56.555,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And complete silence fell.

212
0:12:02.64,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And after about two minutes,

213
0:12:05.198,000 --> 0:12:09,000
everybody moved aside and went home.

214
0:12:09.474,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Now that to me is wisdom in action.

215
0:12:14.956,000 --> 0:12:18,000
In the moment, that's what he did.

216
0:12:19.122,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And it's happening everywhere now.

217
0:12:24.884,000 --> 0:12:25,000
You don't believe me?

218
0:12:26.793,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Have you asked yourselves

219
0:12:30.452,000 --> 0:12:34,000
why and how so many dictatorships have collapsed

220
0:12:34.892,000 --> 0:12:37,000
over the last 30 years?

221
0:12:38.243,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Dictatorships in Czechoslovakia, East Germany,

222
0:12:43.31,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,

223
0:12:47.525,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Mali, Madagascar,

224
0:12:50.411,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Poland, the Philippines,

225
0:12:54.193,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Serbia, Slovenia, I could go on,

226
0:12:59.276,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and now Tunisia and Egypt.

227
0:13:03.866,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And this hasn't just happened.

228
0:13:07.916,000 --> 0:13:1,000
A lot of it is due to a book

229
0:13:11.067,000 --> 0:13:15,000
written by an 80-year-old man in Boston, Gene Sharp.

230
0:13:15.532,000 --> 0:13:19,000
He wrote a book called "From Dictatorship to Democracy"

231
0:13:19.549,000 --> 0:13:24,000
with 81 methodologies for non-violent resistance.

232
0:13:24.945,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And it's been translated into 26 languages.

233
0:13:27.032,000 --> 0:13:29,000
It's flown around the world.

234
0:13:29.116,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And it's being used by young people and older people everywhere,

235
0:13:36.303,000 --> 0:13:41,000
because it works and it's effective.

236
0:13:41.725,000 --> 0:13:45,000
So this is what gives me hope --

237
0:13:46.283,000 --> 0:13:49,000
not just hope, this is what makes me feel very positive right now.

238
0:13:50.036,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Because finally human beings are getting it.

239
0:13:54.052,000 --> 0:14:01,000
We're getting practical, doable methodologies

240
0:14:01.67,000 --> 0:14:02,000
to answer my question:

241
0:14:03.254,000 --> 0:14:09,000
How do we deal with a bully without becoming a thug?

242
0:14:09.556,000 --> 0:14:13,000
We're using the kind of skills that I've outlined:

243
0:14:13.966,000 --> 0:14:16,000
inner power -- the development of inner power -- through self-knowledge,

244
0:14:17.684,000 --> 0:14:2,000
recognizing and working with our fear,

245
0:14:21.25,000 --> 0:14:24,000
using anger as a fuel,

246
0:14:24.768,000 --> 0:14:26,000
cooperating with others,

247
0:14:27.333,000 --> 0:14:28,000
banding together with others,

248
0:14:29.268,000 --> 0:14:31,000
courage,

249
0:14:31.45,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and most importantly, commitment to active non-violence.

250
0:14:38.419,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Now I don't just believe in non-violence.

251
0:14:42.533,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I don't have to believe in it.

252
0:14:45.468,000 --> 0:14:48,000
I see evidence everywhere of how it works.

253
0:14:49.018,000 --> 0:14:55,000
And I see that we, ordinary people,

254
0:14:55.068,000 --> 0:15:01,000
can do what Aung San Suu Kyi and Ghandi and Mandela did.

255
0:15:01.386,000 --> 0:15:03,000
We can bring to an end

256
0:15:04.109,000 --> 0:15:08,000
the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known.

257
0:15:09.108,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And we can organize to overcome oppression

258
0:15:17.049,000 --> 0:15:19,000
by opening our hearts

259
0:15:19.667,000 --> 0:15:24,000
as well as strengthening this incredible resolve.

260
0:15:25.517,000 --> 0:15:29,000
And this open-heartedness is exactly what I've experienced

261
0:15:30.117,000 --> 0:15:34,000
in the entire organization of this gathering since I got here yesterday.

262
0:15:34.551,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Thank you.

263
0:15:36.672,000 --> 0:15:4,000
(Applause)

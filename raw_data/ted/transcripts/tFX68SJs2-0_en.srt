1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I know what you're thinking.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
You think I've lost my way,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and guide me gently back to my seat.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
(Applause)

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I get that all the time in Dubai.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"Here on holiday are you, dear?"

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
"Come to visit the children?

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
How long are you staying?"

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Well actually, I hope for a while longer yet.

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I have been living and teaching in the Gulf

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
for over 30 years.

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Applause)

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And in that time, I have seen a lot of changes.

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
Now that statistic

17
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
is quite shocking.

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And I want to talk to you today

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
about language loss

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and the globalization of English.

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I want to tell you about my friend

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi.

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And one fine day,

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
she decided to take them into the garden

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to teach them some nature vocabulary.

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But it was she who ended up learning

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
all the Arabic words for the local plants,

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
as well as their uses --

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
medicinal uses, cosmetics,

30
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
cooking, herbal.

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
How did those students get all that knowledge?

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Of course, from their grandparents

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and even their great-grandparents.

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It's not necessary to tell you how important it is

35
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to be able to communicate

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
across generations.

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But sadly, today,

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
languages are dying

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
at an unprecedented rate.

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
A language dies every 14 days.

41
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Now, at the same time,

42
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
English is the undisputed global language.

43
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Could there be a connection?

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Well I don't know.

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But I do know that I've seen a lot of changes.

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
When I first came out to the Gulf, I came to Kuwait

47
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
in the days when it was still a hardship post.

48
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Actually, not that long ago.

49
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
That is a little bit too early.

50
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But nevertheless,

51
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I was recruited by the British Council,

52
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
along with about 25 other teachers.

53
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And we were the first non-Muslims

54
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to teach in the state schools there in Kuwait.

55
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We were brought to teach English

56
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
because the government wanted to modernize the country

57
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and to empower the citizens through education.

58
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And of course, the U.K. benefited

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
from some of that lovely oil wealth.

60
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Okay.

61
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Now this is the major change that I've seen --

62
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
how teaching English

63
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
has morphed

64
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
from being a mutually beneficial practice

65
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
to becoming a massive international business that it is today.

66
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum,

67
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and no longer the sole domain

68
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
of mother England,

69
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
it has become a bandwagon

70
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
for every English-speaking nation on earth.

71
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And why not?

72
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
After all, the best education --

73
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
according to the latest World University Rankings --

74
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
is to be found in the universities

75
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
of the U.K. and the U.S.

76
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So everybody wants to have an English education, naturally.

77
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But if you're not a native speaker,

78
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
you have to pass a test.

79
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now can it be right

80
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to reject a student

81
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
on linguistic ability alone?

82
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Perhaps you have a computer scientist

83
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
who's a genius.

84
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Would he need the same language as a lawyer, for example?

85
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Well, I don't think so.

86
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We English teachers reject them all the time.

87
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We put a stop sign,

88
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and we stop them in their tracks.

89
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
They can't pursue their dream any longer,

90
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
'til they get English.

91
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Now let me put it this way:

92
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker

93
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
who had the cure for cancer,

94
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
would I stop him from entering my British University?

95
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I don't think so.

96
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But indeed, that is exactly what we do.

97
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
We English teachers are the gatekeepers.

98
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And you have to satisfy us first

99
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that your English is good enough.

100
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Now it can be dangerous

101
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
to give too much power

102
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
to a narrow segment of society.

103
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Maybe the barrier would be too universal.

104
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Okay.

105
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"But," I hear you say,

106
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
"what about the research?

107
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It's all in English."

108
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So the books are in English,

109
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
the journals are done in English,

110
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

111
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
It feeds the English requirement.

112
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And so it goes on.

113
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I ask you, what happened to translation?

114
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
If you think about the Islamic Golden Age,

115
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
there was lots of translation then.

116
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
They translated from Latin and Greek

117
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
into Arabic, into Persian,

118
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and then it was translated on

119
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
into the Germanic languages of Europe

120
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and the Romance languages.

121
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe.

122
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Now don't get me wrong;

123
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I am not against teaching English,

124
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
all you English teachers out there.

125
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I love it that we have a global language.

126
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
We need one today more than ever.

127
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
But I am against using it

128
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
as a barrier.

129
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Do we really want to end up with 600 languages

130
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and the main one being English, or Chinese?

131
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
We need more than that. Where do we draw the line?

132
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
This system

133
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
equates intelligence

134
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
with a knowledge of English,

135
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
which is quite arbitrary.

136
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
(Applause)

137
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And I want to remind you

138
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that the giants upon whose shoulders

139
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
today's intelligentsia stand

140
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
did not have to have English,

141
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
they didn't have to pass an English test.

142
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Case in point, Einstein.

143
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
He, by the way, was considered remedial at school

144
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
because he was, in fact, dyslexic.

145
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But fortunately for the world,

146
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
he did not have to pass an English test.

147
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Because they didn't start until 1964

148
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
with TOEFL,

149
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
the American test of English.

150
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Now it's exploded.

151
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
There are lots and lots of tests of English.

152
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And millions and millions of students

153
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
take these tests every year.

154
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Now you might think, you and me,

155
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
"Those fees aren't bad, they're okay,"

156
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but they are prohibitive

157
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
to so many millions of poor people.

158
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So immediately, we're rejecting them.

159
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Applause)

160
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
It brings to mind a headline I saw recently:

161
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
"Education: The Great Divide."

162
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Now I get it,

163
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I understand why people would want to focus on English.

164
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
They want to give their children the best chance in life.

165
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And to do that, they need a Western education.

166
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Because, of course, the best jobs

167
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
go to people out of the Western Universities,

168
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that I put on earlier.

169
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It's a circular thing.

170
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Okay.

171
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Let me tell you a story about two scientists,

172
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
two English scientists.

173
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
They were doing an experiment

174
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to do with genetics

175
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals.

176
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
But they couldn't get the results they wanted.

177
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
They really didn't know what to do,

178
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
until along came a German scientist

179
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
who realized that they were using two words

180
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
for forelimb and hind limb,

181
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
whereas genetics does not differentiate

182
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and neither does German.

183
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
So bingo,

184
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
problem solved.

185
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
If you can't think a thought,

186
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
you are stuck.

187
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
But if another language can think that thought,

188
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
then, by cooperating,

189
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
we can achieve and learn so much more.

190
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
My daughter

191
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
came to England from Kuwait.

192
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic.

193
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It's an Arabic-medium school.

194
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
She had to translate it into English at her grammar school.

195
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And she was the best in the class

196
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
at those subjects.

197
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Which tells us

198
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that when students come to us from abroad,

199
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
we may not be giving them enough credit

200
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
for what they know,

201
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and they know it in their own language.

202
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
When a language dies,

203
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
we don't know what we lose with that language.

204
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
This is -- I don't know if you saw it on CNN recently --

205
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
they gave the Heroes Award

206
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
to a young Kenyan shepherd boy

207
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
who couldn't study at night in his village,

208
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
like all the village children,

209
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
because the kerosene lamp,

210
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
it had smoke and it damaged his eyes.

211
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And anyway, there was never enough kerosene,

212
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
because what does a dollar a day buy for you?

213
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So he invented

214
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
a cost-free solar lamp.

215
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And now the children in his village

216
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
get the same grades at school

217
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
as the children who have electricity at home.

218
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(Applause)

219
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
When he received his award,

220
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
he said these lovely words:

221
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
"The children can lead Africa from what it is today,

222
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
a dark continent,

223
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
to a light continent."

224
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
A simple idea,

225
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
but it could have such far-reaching consequences.

226
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
People who have no light,

227
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
whether it's physical or metaphorical,

228
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
cannot pass our exams,

229
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and we can never know what they know.

230
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Let us not keep them and ourselves

231
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
in the dark.

232
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Let us celebrate diversity.

233
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Mind your language.

234
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Use it to spread great ideas.

235
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
(Applause)

236
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Thank you very much.

237
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
(Applause)

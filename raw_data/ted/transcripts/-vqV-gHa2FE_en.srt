2
0:00:12.681,000 --> 0:00:16,000
We lost a lot of time at school learning spelling.

3
0:00:17.784,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Kids are still losing a lot of time at school with spelling.

4
0:00:24.405,000 --> 0:00:27,000
That's why I want to share a question with you:

5
0:00:29.54,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Do we need new spelling rules?

6
0:00:33.392,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I believe that yes, we do.

7
0:00:35.71,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Or even better, I think we need to simplify the ones we already have.

8
0:00:41.007,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Neither the question nor the answer are new in the Spanish language.

9
0:00:45.309,000 --> 0:00:49,000
They have been bouncing around from century to century

10
0:00:49.547,000 --> 0:00:54,000
since 1492, when in the first grammar guide of the Spanish language,

11
0:00:55.174,000 --> 0:01:,000
Antonio de Nebrija, set a clear and simple principle for our spelling:

12
0:01:00.94,000 --> 0:01:02,000
"... thus, we have to write words as we pronounce them,

13
0:01:03.883,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and pronounce words as we write them."

14
0:01:06.287,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Each sound was to correspond to one letter,

15
0:01:09.613,000 --> 0:01:12,000
each letter was to represent a single sound,

16
0:01:12.962,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and those which did not represent any sound should be removed.

17
0:01:19.337,000 --> 0:01:21,000
This approach, the phonetic approach,

18
0:01:21.816,000 --> 0:01:24,000
which says we have to write words as we pronounce them,

19
0:01:25.457,000 --> 0:01:29,000
both is and isn't at the root of spelling as we practice it today.

20
0:01:30.721,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It is, because the Spanish language, in contrast to English, French or others,

21
0:01:36.246,000 --> 0:01:41,000
always strongly resisted writing words too differently

22
0:01:41.581,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to how we pronounce them.

23
0:01:43.303,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But the phonetic approach is also absent today,

24
0:01:45.596,000 --> 0:01:48,000
because when, in the 18th century, we decided how we would standardize

25
0:01:48.956,000 --> 0:01:49,000
our writing,

26
0:01:50.192,000 --> 0:01:54,000
there was another approach which guided a good part of the decisions.

27
0:01:54.229,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It was the etymological approach,

28
0:01:57.095,000 --> 0:01:59,000
the one that says we have to write words

29
0:01:59.312,000 --> 0:02:02,000
according to how they were written in their original language,

30
0:02:02.49,000 --> 0:02:03,000
in Latin, in Greek.

31
0:02:04.056,000 --> 0:02:08,000
That's how we ended up with silent H's, which we write but don't pronounce.

32
0:02:08.88,000 --> 0:02:13,000
That's how we have B's and V's that, contrary to what many people believe,

33
0:02:14.192,000 --> 0:02:17,000
were never differentiated in Spanish pronunciation.

34
0:02:18.28,000 --> 0:02:2,000
That's how we wound up with G's,

35
0:02:20.352,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that are sometimes aspirated, as in "gente,"

36
0:02:23.057,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and other times unaspirated, as in "gato."

37
0:02:25.462,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That's how we ended up with C's, S's and Z's,

38
0:02:29.81,000 --> 0:02:32,000
three letters that in some places correspond to one sound,

39
0:02:33.062,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and in others, to two, but nowhere to three.

40
0:02:37.62,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I'm not here to tell you anything you don't know from your own experience.

41
0:02:43.188,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We all went to school,

42
0:02:46.161,000 --> 0:02:5,000
we all invested big amounts of learning time,

43
0:02:50.832,000 --> 0:02:54,000
big amounts of pliant, childlike brain time

44
0:02:55.554,000 --> 0:02:56,000
in dictation,

45
0:02:57.185,000 --> 0:03:02,000
in the memorization of spelling rules filled, nevertheless, with exceptions.

46
0:03:02.739,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We were told in many ways, implicitly and explicitly,

47
0:03:06.55,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that in spelling, something fundamental to our upbringing was at stake.

48
0:03:13.081,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Yet, I have the feeling

49
0:03:15.406,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that teachers didn't ask themselves why it was so important.

50
0:03:19.065,000 --> 0:03:22,000
In fact, they didn't ask themselves a previous question:

51
0:03:22.217,000 --> 0:03:24,000
What is the purpose of spelling?

52
0:03:25.813,000 --> 0:03:27,000
What do we need spelling for?

53
0:03:30.439,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And the truth is, when someone asks themselves this question,

54
0:03:33.38,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the answer is much simpler and less momentous

55
0:03:36.493,000 --> 0:03:37,000
than we'd usually believe.

56
0:03:38.492,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We use spelling to unify the way we write, so we can all write the same way,

57
0:03:45.235,000 --> 0:03:49,000
making it easier for us to understand when we read to each other.

58
0:03:50.227,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But unlike in other aspects of language such as punctuation,

59
0:03:55.823,000 --> 0:04:01,000
in spelling, there's no individual expression involved.

60
0:04:01.946,000 --> 0:04:02,000
In punctuation, there is.

61
0:04:03.937,000 --> 0:04:06,000
With punctuation, I can choose to change the meaning of a phrase.

62
0:04:07.917,000 --> 0:04:12,000
With punctuation, I can impose a particular rhythm to what I am writing,

63
0:04:13.366,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but not with spelling.

64
0:04:15.629,000 --> 0:04:18,000
When it comes to spelling, it's either wrong or right,

65
0:04:19.23,000 --> 0:04:22,000
according to whether it conforms or not to the current rules.

66
0:04:23.514,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But then, wouldn't it be more sensible to simplify the current rules

67
0:04:28.892,000 --> 0:04:33,000
so it would be easier to teach, learn and use spelling correctly?

68
0:04:35.498,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Wouldn't it be more sensible to simplify the current rules

69
0:04:40.029,000 --> 0:04:45,000
so that all the time we devote today to teaching spelling,

70
0:04:45.405,000 --> 0:04:48,000
we could devote to other language issues

71
0:04:48.497,000 --> 0:04:51,000
whose complexities do, in fact, deserve the time and effort?

72
0:04:54.253,000 --> 0:04:58,000
What I propose is not to abolish spelling,

73
0:04:59.241,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and have everyone write however they want.

74
0:05:03.698,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Language is a tool of common usage,

75
0:05:07.642,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and so I believe it's fundamental that we use it following common criteria.

76
0:05:13.429,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But I also find it fundamental

77
0:05:15.625,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that those common criteria be as simple as possible,

78
0:05:19.995,000 --> 0:05:22,000
especially because if we simplify our spelling,

79
0:05:23.853,000 --> 0:05:25,000
we're not leveling it down;

80
0:05:26.69,000 --> 0:05:28,000
when spelling is simplified,

81
0:05:29.387,000 --> 0:05:32,000
the quality of the language doesn't suffer at all.

82
0:05:33.929,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I work every day with Spanish Golden Age literature,

83
0:05:37.862,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I read Garcilaso, Cervantes, Góngora, Quevedo,

84
0:05:41.49,000 --> 0:05:43,000
who sometimes write "hombre" without H,

85
0:05:44.461,000 --> 0:05:47,000
sometimes write "escribir" with V,

86
0:05:47.713,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and it's absolutely clear to me

87
0:05:50.176,000 --> 0:05:55,000
that the difference between those texts and ours is one of convention,

88
0:05:55.601,000 --> 0:05:58,000
or rather, a lack of convention during their time.

89
0:05:59.218,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But it's not a difference of quality.

90
0:06:02.164,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But let me go back to the masters,

91
0:06:04.612,000 --> 0:06:07,000
because they're key characters in this story.

92
0:06:07.99,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Earlier, I mentioned this slightly thoughtless insistence

93
0:06:13.455,000 --> 0:06:15,000
with which teachers pester and pester us

94
0:06:16.393,000 --> 0:06:17,000
over spelling.

95
0:06:17.917,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But the truth is, things being as they are,

96
0:06:21.413,000 --> 0:06:23,000
this makes perfect sense.

97
0:06:23.729,000 --> 0:06:28,000
In our society, spelling serves as an index of privilege,

98
0:06:29.092,000 --> 0:06:33,000
separating the cultured from the brute, the educated from the ignorant,

99
0:06:33.504,000 --> 0:06:37,000
independent of the content that's being written.

100
0:06:38.516,000 --> 0:06:41,000
One can get or not get a job

101
0:06:41.851,000 --> 0:06:43,000
because of an H that one put or did not.

102
0:06:44.544,000 --> 0:06:47,000
One can become an object of public ridicule

103
0:06:47.757,000 --> 0:06:49,000
because of a misplaced B.

104
0:06:50.432,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Therefore, in this context,

105
0:06:52.632,000 --> 0:06:57,000
of course, it makes sense to dedicate all this time to spelling.

106
0:06:57.729,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But we shouldn't forget

107
0:07:00.291,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that throughout the history of our language,

108
0:07:02.515,000 --> 0:07:03,000
it has always been teachers

109
0:07:04.479,000 --> 0:07:07,000
or people involved in the early learning of language

110
0:07:08.428,000 --> 0:07:1,000
who promoted spelling reforms,

111
0:07:10.972,000 --> 0:07:14,000
who realized that in our spelling there was often an obstacle

112
0:07:15.435,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to the transmission of knowledge.

113
0:07:17.848,000 --> 0:07:18,000
In our case, for example,

114
0:07:19.539,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Sarmiento, together with Andrés Bello, spearheaded the biggest spelling reform

115
0:07:24.116,000 --> 0:07:27,000
to take place in the Spanish language:

116
0:07:27.545,000 --> 0:07:31,000
the mid-19th century Chilean reform.

117
0:07:33.714,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Then, why not take over the task of those teachers

118
0:07:38.199,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and start making progress in our spelling?

119
0:07:41.616,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Here, in this intimate group of 10,000,

120
0:07:44.892,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I'd like to bring to the table

121
0:07:46.47,000 --> 0:07:5,000
some changes that I find reasonable to start discussing.

122
0:07:52.027,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Let's remove the silent H.

123
0:07:54.419,000 --> 0:07:59,000
In places where we write an H but pronounce nothing,

124
0:07:59.531,000 --> 0:08:,000
let's not write anything.

125
0:08:00.846,000 --> 0:08:01,000
(Applause)

126
0:08:01.886,000 --> 0:08:03,000
It's hard for me to imagine what sentimental attachment

127
0:08:04.548,000 --> 0:08:08,000
can justify to someone all the hassle caused by the silent H.

128
0:08:09.563,000 --> 0:08:11,000
B and V, as we said before,

129
0:08:11.932,000 --> 0:08:13,000
were never differentiated in the Spanish language --

130
0:08:14.826,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Applause)

131
0:08:15.867,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Let's choose one; it could be either. We can discuss it, talk it over.

132
0:08:19.196,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Everyone will have their preferences and can make their arguments.

133
0:08:22.85,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Let's keep one, remove the other.

134
0:08:25.718,000 --> 0:08:28,000
G and J, let's separate their roles.

135
0:08:28.749,000 --> 0:08:32,000
G should keep the unaspirated sound, like in "gato," "mago," and "águila,"

136
0:08:33.195,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and J should keep the aspirated sound,

137
0:08:36.515,000 --> 0:08:4,000
as in "jarabe," "jirafa," "gente," "argentino."

138
0:08:42.261,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The case of C, S and Z is interesting,

139
0:08:47.613,000 --> 0:08:5,000
because it shows that the phonetic approach must be a guide,

140
0:08:51.474,000 --> 0:08:54,000
but it can't be an absolute principle.

141
0:08:54.563,000 --> 0:08:58,000
In some cases, the differences in pronunciation must be addressed.

142
0:08:59.346,000 --> 0:09:01,000
As I said before, C, S and Z,

143
0:09:02.276,000 --> 0:09:05,000
in some places, correspond to one sound, in others to two.

144
0:09:05.642,000 --> 0:09:1,000
If we go from three letters to two, we're all better off.

145
0:09:12.067,000 --> 0:09:16,000
To some, these changes may seem a bit drastic.

146
0:09:16.961,000 --> 0:09:18,000
They're really not.

147
0:09:19.166,000 --> 0:09:22,000
The Royal Spanish Academy, all of language academies,

148
0:09:22.453,000 --> 0:09:26,000
also believes that spelling should be progressively modified;

149
0:09:27.382,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that language is linked to history, tradition and custom,

150
0:09:32.292,000 --> 0:09:36,000
but that at the same time, it is a practical everyday tool

151
0:09:36.939,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and that sometimes this attachment to history, tradition and custom

152
0:09:41.857,000 --> 0:09:46,000
becomes an obstacle for its current usage.

153
0:09:47.439,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Indeed, this explains the fact

154
0:09:49.572,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that our language, much more than the others we are geographically close to,

155
0:09:56.549,000 --> 0:09:59,000
has been historically modifying itself based on us,

156
0:10:00.101,000 --> 0:10:03,000
for example, we went from "ortographia" to "ortografía,"

157
0:10:03.779,000 --> 0:10:07,000
from "theatro" to "teatro," from "quantidad" to "cantidad,"

158
0:10:07.904,000 --> 0:10:09,000
from "symbolo" to "símbolo."

159
0:10:10.316,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And some silent H's are slowly being stealthily removed:

160
0:10:15.747,000 --> 0:10:17,000
in the Dictionary of the Royal Academy,

161
0:10:18.011,000 --> 0:10:23,000
"arpa" and "armonía" can be written with or without an H.

162
0:10:23.827,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And everybody is OK.

163
0:10:27.272,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I also believe

164
0:10:30.044,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that this is a particularly appropriate moment to have this discussion.

165
0:10:37.217,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It's always said that language changes spontaneously,

166
0:10:41.252,000 --> 0:10:42,000
from the bottom up,

167
0:10:43.142,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that its users are the ones who incorporate new words

168
0:10:46.439,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and who introduce grammatical changes,

169
0:10:49.998,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and that the authority -- in some places an academy,

170
0:10:53.839,000 --> 0:10:56,000
in others a dictionary, in others a ministry --

171
0:10:57.774,000 --> 0:11:,000
accepts and incorporates them long after the fact.

172
0:11:02.396,000 --> 0:11:05,000
This is true only for some levels of language.

173
0:11:06.068,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It is true on the lexical level, the level of words.

174
0:11:09.487,000 --> 0:11:12,000
It is less true on the grammatical level,

175
0:11:12.765,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and I would almost say it is not true for the spelling level,

176
0:11:16.975,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that has historically changed from the top down.

177
0:11:21.04,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Institutions have always been the ones to establish the rules

178
0:11:25.099,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and propose changes.

179
0:11:28.963,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Why do I say this is a particularly appropriate moment?

180
0:11:33.777,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Until today,

181
0:11:35.169,000 --> 0:11:41,000
writing always had a much more restricted and private use than speech.

182
0:11:41.938,000 --> 0:11:45,000
But in our time, the age of social networks,

183
0:11:46.436,000 --> 0:11:49,000
this is going through a revolutionary change.

184
0:11:50.131,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Never before have people written so much;

185
0:11:53.199,000 --> 0:11:57,000
never before have people written for so many others to see.

186
0:11:58.356,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And in these social networks, for the first time,

187
0:12:01.497,000 --> 0:12:06,000
we're seeing innovative uses of spelling on a large scale,

188
0:12:06.561,000 --> 0:12:1,000
where even more-than-educated people with impeccable spelling,

189
0:12:11.194,000 --> 0:12:13,000
when using social networks,

190
0:12:13.498,000 --> 0:12:18,000
behave a lot like the majority of users of social networks behave.

191
0:12:19.071,000 --> 0:12:22,000
That is to say, they slack on spell-checking

192
0:12:22.777,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and prioritize speed and efficacy in communication.

193
0:12:28.129,000 --> 0:12:33,000
For now, on social networks, we see chaotic, individual usages.

194
0:12:33.584,000 --> 0:12:36,000
But I think we have to pay attention to them,

195
0:12:36.625,000 --> 0:12:38,000
because they're probably telling us

196
0:12:38.996,000 --> 0:12:42,000
that an era that designates a new place for writing

197
0:12:43.618,000 --> 0:12:47,000
seeks new criteria for that writing.

198
0:12:48.268,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I think we'd be wrong to reject them, to discard them,

199
0:12:53.41,000 --> 0:12:57,000
because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decay of our times.

200
0:12:58.406,000 --> 0:13:02,000
No, I believe we have to observe them, organize them and channel them

201
0:13:03.368,000 --> 0:13:08,000
within guidelines that better correspond to the needs of our times.

202
0:13:10.561,000 --> 0:13:13,000
I can anticipate some objections.

203
0:13:15.344,000 --> 0:13:16,000
There will be those who'll say

204
0:13:16.798,000 --> 0:13:21,000
that if we simplify spelling we'll lose etymology.

205
0:13:22.743,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Strictly speaking, if we wanted to preserve etymology,

206
0:13:25.857,000 --> 0:13:27,000
it would go beyond just spelling.

207
0:13:28.311,000 --> 0:13:32,000
We'd also have to learn Latin, Greek, Arabic.

208
0:13:33.059,000 --> 0:13:35,000
With simplified spelling,

209
0:13:35.714,000 --> 0:13:4,000
we would normalize etymology in the same place we do now:

210
0:13:40.928,000 --> 0:13:42,000
in etymological dictionaries.

211
0:13:43.937,000 --> 0:13:46,000
A second objection will come from those who say:

212
0:13:46.968,000 --> 0:13:49,000
"If we simplify spelling, we'll stop distinguishing

213
0:13:50.71,000 --> 0:13:53,000
between words that differ in just one letter."

214
0:13:54.41,000 --> 0:13:58,000
That is true, but it's not a problem.

215
0:13:58.524,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Our language has homonyms, words with more than one meaning,

216
0:14:03.524,000 --> 0:14:05,000
yet we don't confuse the "banco" where we sit

217
0:14:06.31,000 --> 0:14:08,000
with the "banco" where we deposit money,

218
0:14:08.406,000 --> 0:14:11,000
or the "traje" that we wear with the things we "trajimos."

219
0:14:11.679,000 --> 0:14:17,000
In the vast majority of situations, context dispels any confusion.

220
0:14:19.012,000 --> 0:14:21,000
But there's a third objection.

221
0:14:23.922,000 --> 0:14:24,000
To me,

222
0:14:26.873,000 --> 0:14:29,000
it's the most understandable, even the most moving.

223
0:14:30.342,000 --> 0:14:33,000
It's the people who'll say: "I don't want to change.

224
0:14:34.356,000 --> 0:14:37,000
I was brought up like this, I got used to doing it this way,

225
0:14:38.089,000 --> 0:14:44,000
when I read a written word in simplified spelling, my eyes hurt."

226
0:14:44.386,000 --> 0:14:45,000
(Laughter)

227
0:14:46.211,000 --> 0:14:5,000
This objection is, in part, in all of us.

228
0:14:52.003,000 --> 0:14:53,000
What do I think we should do?

229
0:14:53.516,000 --> 0:14:55,000
The same thing that's always done in these cases:

230
0:14:56.249,000 --> 0:15:01,000
changes are made looking forward; children are taught the new rules,

231
0:15:01.686,000 --> 0:15:05,000
those of us who don't want to adapt can write the way we're used to writing,

232
0:15:06.243,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and hopefully, time will cement the new rules in place.

233
0:15:11.084,000 --> 0:15:17,000
The success of every spelling reform that affects deeply rooted habits

234
0:15:17.615,000 --> 0:15:22,000
lies in caution, agreement, gradualism and tolerance.

235
0:15:23.483,000 --> 0:15:27,000
At the same time, can't allow the attachment to old customs

236
0:15:27.825,000 --> 0:15:29,000
impede us from moving forward.

237
0:15:30.595,000 --> 0:15:33,000
The best tribute we can pay to the past

238
0:15:34.055,000 --> 0:15:36,000
is to improve upon what it's given us.

239
0:15:37.075,000 --> 0:15:39,000
So I believe that we must reach an agreement,

240
0:15:39.672,000 --> 0:15:42,000
that academies must reach an agreement,

241
0:15:42.707,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and purge from our spelling rules

242
0:15:45.669,000 --> 0:15:48,000
all the habits we practice just for the sake of tradition,

243
0:15:49.398,000 --> 0:15:5,000
even if they are useless now.

244
0:15:51.505,000 --> 0:15:54,000
I'm convinced that if we do that

245
0:15:55.005,000 --> 0:15:59,000
in the humble but extremely important realm of language,

246
0:15:59.029,000 --> 0:16:04,000
we'll be leaving a better future to the next generations.

247
0:16:04.942,000 --> 0:16:07,000
(Applause)

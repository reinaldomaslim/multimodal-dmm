1
0:00:13.625,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I want to start out with quoting Helen Keller,

2
0:00:18.583,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that great woman that we all admire.

3
0:00:21.667,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And she had a statement that is very profound,

4
0:00:26.333,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and this statement is

5
0:00:28.417,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that science has been able to find cures for many evils,

6
0:00:34.5,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but never the greatest evil of all in human beings,

7
0:00:39.5,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and that evil is apathy.

8
0:00:43.792,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So, we know that apathy really costs us a lot,

9
0:00:48.292,000 --> 0:00:5,000
especially in our democracy.

10
0:00:50.75,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And when we think of why people do not get involved,

11
0:00:54.208,000 --> 0:00:56,000
why they do not become activists,

12
0:00:56.5,000 --> 0:01:01,000
it's often that people are so worn down with their own familial responsibilities,

13
0:01:02.208,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and women especially.

14
0:01:04.5,000 --> 0:01:07,000
You know, women, they have so many inhibitions.

15
0:01:08.083,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Many of them have suffered so much trauma in their lives,

16
0:01:11.5,000 --> 0:01:13,000
so many aggressions in their lives.

17
0:01:13.75,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And so it's very hard for them to realize that they have leadership capacities.

18
0:01:18.833,000 --> 0:01:2,000
That they can get out there, and they could change the world.

19
0:01:22.583,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Another thing that many women --

20
0:01:24.625,000 --> 0:01:26,000
we think that we have to do everything.

21
0:01:26.917,000 --> 0:01:29,000
That we are the only ones responsible for our families,

22
0:01:30.5,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and it is so hard for us to delegate

23
0:01:33.917,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and just get others to help us do the duties that we are responsible for.

24
0:01:38.292,000 --> 0:01:4,000
We feel embarrassed or we feel guilty.

25
0:01:40.833,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But we know that we have to make this happen,

26
0:01:43.375,000 --> 0:01:47,000
because if not, we will never have time to be able to volunteer

27
0:01:47.833,000 --> 0:01:51,000
to help on these many causes that are now facing us.

28
0:01:53.333,000 --> 0:01:55,000
One of the areas that women can give up a little bit of time

29
0:01:56.208,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and that is in shopping, OK?

30
0:01:58.208,000 --> 0:02:,000
(Laughter)

31
0:02:00.75,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And especially when we go out there

32
0:02:02.458,000 --> 0:02:04,000
shopping for things that we don't even need.

33
0:02:04.583,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

34
0:02:05.625,000 --> 0:02:08,000
You know, you never saw a hearse with a U-Haul behind it.

35
0:02:09.375,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:12.417,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We have to live simply, so that others can simply live.

37
0:02:16.042,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And when we think of the kind of inheritance

38
0:02:18.375,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that we want to leave to our children or our grandchildren,

39
0:02:21.75,000 --> 0:02:24,000
think of leaving them a legacy of justice.

40
0:02:24.833,000 --> 0:02:26,000
This is a legacy that they can not only imitate,

41
0:02:27.5,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but they can be proud of for the rest of their lives.

42
0:02:30.667,000 --> 0:02:33,000
If we leave them a lot of material goods, all they're going to do is fight,

43
0:02:34.667,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and they're going to hate each other.

44
0:02:36.5,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Just remember that, when we think about what we're doing.

45
0:02:39.583,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The other thing that we have to do to liberate our women, eventually,

46
0:02:44.208,000 --> 0:02:47,000
so that we can do the kind of volunteer work that we need to do

47
0:02:47.542,000 --> 0:02:48,000
to change this world,

48
0:02:49.083,000 --> 0:02:53,000
is we have to have a different kind of an education for our young women.

49
0:02:53.583,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Unfortunately, in our societies around the world,

50
0:02:57.083,000 --> 0:02:59,000
women are taught to be victims.

51
0:03:00.083,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Women are not taught that they are going to have to defend themselves,

52
0:03:04.042,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that they're going to have to support themselves

53
0:03:06.375,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and they have to protect themselves.

54
0:03:08.292,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Because, you know, when we actually look at the animal kingdom,

55
0:03:11.269,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and we see who are the most ferocious, the male or the female?

56
0:03:15.667,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We know it's the female, right?

57
0:03:17.625,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So something went wrong with us at the top of that animal kingdom as women.

58
0:03:22.25,000 --> 0:03:23,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:23.917,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So I want to give you an example of how I found my voice.

60
0:03:27.292,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And I was very fortunate in that, when I was 25 years old,

61
0:03:30.875,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I met a gentleman named Fred Ross Sr.,

62
0:03:33.292,000 --> 0:03:37,000
who organized a chapter of a group called the Community Service Organization

63
0:03:38.167,000 --> 0:03:4,000
in my hometown of Stockton, California.

64
0:03:41.042,000 --> 0:03:45,000
This was a grassroots organization, and I was recruited to be a volunteer.

65
0:03:46.208,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So, one day, while we were sitting in the office,

66
0:03:49.458,000 --> 0:03:51,000
a farm worker comes in.

67
0:03:51.5,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And he's paralyzed, he can hardly walk, he has a crutch.

68
0:03:55.542,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And he needs help.

69
0:03:56.875,000 --> 0:03:58,000
He needs someone to help him go down to the welfare office

70
0:03:59.625,000 --> 0:04:,000
and make an application.

71
0:04:00.958,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So, I volunteered to do that.

72
0:04:03.167,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But when I got to the welfare office,

73
0:04:05.708,000 --> 0:04:09,000
they would not let me make an application for this gentleman.

74
0:04:10.167,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So I didn't know what to do, I was at a loss.

75
0:04:13.042,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So I went back to the office, and I told Mr. Ross,

76
0:04:15.875,000 --> 0:04:17,000
"They won't let me make an application."

77
0:04:18.417,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And he said to me, very sternly,

78
0:04:20.958,000 --> 0:04:23,000
"You go right back down to that welfare office,

79
0:04:24.5,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and you demand to see a supervisor.

80
0:04:27.875,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And you demand that they let him make an application."

81
0:04:31.875,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And I thought, "Wow, I can do that?"

82
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:35.083,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So I thought about it,

84
0:04:36.375,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and I kind of overcame my anxieties and my fears.

85
0:04:39.375,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I went down to the welfare office and I demanded to see the supervisor.

86
0:04:43.208,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Sure enough, he came out,

87
0:04:45.458,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and they had to let Mr. Ruiz make an application for welfare.

88
0:04:48.833,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And he got his disability for himself and his family.

89
0:04:52.333,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But that taught me a lesson.

90
0:04:54.042,000 --> 0:04:56,000
That taught me that I had a voice.

91
0:04:56.625,000 --> 0:05:,000
Well, Mr. Ross also taught many of us many other things, including Cesar Chavez

92
0:05:00.958,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and many other volunteers.

93
0:05:02.833,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And he taught us not only that we can make demands of people,

94
0:05:06.375,000 --> 0:05:08,000
especially our public officials.

95
0:05:08.958,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And this is something we should always keep in mind:

96
0:05:11.417,000 --> 0:05:15,000
every public official -- guess what -- they work for us.

97
0:05:15.583,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Because we pay their salaries with out taxes.

98
0:05:18.75,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And they are actually our servants.

99
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Some of them turn out to be leaders, but not all of them.

100
0:05:24.75,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Laughter)

101
0:05:25.833,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Once in a while we get a leader out of there.

102
0:05:28.792,000 --> 0:05:32,000
The other thing that Mr. Ross taught us is that voting is extremely important.

103
0:05:33.75,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And not just voting,

104
0:05:35.333,000 --> 0:05:38,000
but going out there and getting other people to vote.

105
0:05:38.708,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Going door to door.

106
0:05:40.792,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Phone banking, talking to voters,

107
0:05:42.917,000 --> 0:05:45,000
because many voters have a lot of doubts and they don't know how to vote.

108
0:05:46.458,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And unfortunately,

109
0:05:47.75,000 --> 0:05:5,000
we know that in many countries people are not allowed to vote

110
0:05:50.833,000 --> 0:05:52,000
because we have voter suppression in other countries,

111
0:05:53.625,000 --> 0:05:55,000
like we do here in the United States of America.

112
0:05:55.917,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But the thing is, if we can get out there as individuals

113
0:05:58.583,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and talk to people, so we can remove their apathy

114
0:06:02.125,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and make sure that they can vote.

115
0:06:04.417,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So, I want to give you an example of a woman in our foundation,

116
0:06:08.583,000 --> 0:06:09,000
the Dolores Huerta Foundation,

117
0:06:10.208,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and just to show you that sometimes people have power,

118
0:06:13.875,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but they don't know it.

119
0:06:15.167,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But once they find it, they do miraculous things.

120
0:06:18.125,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So, Leticia Prado is an immigrant from Mexico,

121
0:06:22.333,000 --> 0:06:24,000
only has a sixth-grade education

122
0:06:24.5,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and speaks very limited English.

123
0:06:27.208,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But she was very concerned

124
0:06:29.125,000 --> 0:06:34,000
because the children at the middle school in their town called Weedpatch --

125
0:06:34.5,000 --> 0:06:36,000
this is in California, Central Valley --

126
0:06:36.583,000 --> 0:06:39,000
they couldn't go out and play in the schoolyard,

127
0:06:39.875,000 --> 0:06:41,000
because the air quality is so bad

128
0:06:42.5,000 --> 0:06:44,000
in the southern part of Kern County, California

129
0:06:45.083,000 --> 0:06:47,000
in our United States of America.

130
0:06:47.125,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So she and her husband went out there, and they passed a bond issue

131
0:06:51.917,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to build a brand new, state-of-the-art gymnasium

132
0:06:55.333,000 --> 0:06:57,000
for the kids at their middle school.

133
0:06:58.75,000 --> 0:06:59,000
That was a big success.

134
0:07:00.5,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Then she heard a rumor

135
0:07:02.125,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that the principal was going to end the breakfast program

136
0:07:05.542,000 --> 0:07:06,000
for the farm worker children,

137
0:07:07.042,000 --> 0:07:1,000
because the principal thought it was just too much paperwork.

138
0:07:10.792,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So, Leticia got herself elected to the school board.

139
0:07:14.167,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And they kept the breakfast program, and she got rid of the principal.

140
0:07:17.875,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

141
0:07:20.167,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Applause)

142
0:07:24.833,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So there were other rumors

143
0:07:26.333,000 --> 0:07:29,000
about some corruption in the local water district.

144
0:07:29.792,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So, Leticia got herself elected to the water district.

145
0:07:32.542,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Then she looked into all of the finances of the water district

146
0:07:35.5,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and found there was 250,000 dollars missing from their bank account.

147
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So, Leticia called in the grand jury, and several arrests have been made.

148
0:07:45.625,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And this is just an example of a woman who never went to high school,

149
0:07:50.917,000 --> 0:07:51,000
never went to college,

150
0:07:52.208,000 --> 0:07:53,000
but she found her power.

151
0:07:53.667,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And in addition, she has recruited other people in the community

152
0:07:57.167,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to also run for public office,

153
0:07:59.167,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and guess what -- they've all gotten themselves elected.

154
0:08:01.833,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So, I take that Leticia really embodies

155
0:08:07.083,000 --> 0:08:09,000
something that Coretta Scott King said.

156
0:08:09.75,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And I want to share this with you. Coretta Scott King said,

157
0:08:12.75,000 --> 0:08:15,000
"We will never have peace in the world until women take power."

158
0:08:17.708,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Applause)

159
0:08:23.792,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Now, I have amended that statement to say

160
0:08:26.333,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that we will never have peace in the world until feminists take power.

161
0:08:31.333,000 --> 0:08:32,000
(Laughter)

162
0:08:32.417,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Because we know there is a difference, right?

163
0:08:34.917,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Not only that, but if we want to define what is a feminist --

164
0:08:38.833,000 --> 0:08:4,000
a person who stands up for reproductive rights,

165
0:08:41.667,000 --> 0:08:43,000
for immigrants' rights, for the environment,

166
0:08:44.625,000 --> 0:08:48,000
for LGBT rights and also for labor unions and working people.

167
0:08:49.625,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Applause)

168
0:08:54.832,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Which also means that men can also be feminists.

169
0:08:58.875,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Applause)

170
0:09:04.542,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So when we think of feminization,

171
0:09:06.875,000 --> 0:09:09,000
we should also think of how can we feminize the policies,

172
0:09:10.375,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and not only of our major countries,

173
0:09:12.75,000 --> 0:09:14,000
the wealthy countries like the United States,

174
0:09:14.875,000 --> 0:09:15,000
but all over the world,

175
0:09:16.208,000 --> 0:09:18,000
our domestic and foreign policy.

176
0:09:18.458,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And one of the things that we can do to stop wars and to have peace

177
0:09:22.292,000 --> 0:09:24,000
is to make sure that the wealthiest countries in the world

178
0:09:25.25,000 --> 0:09:26,000
also help the developing countries.

179
0:09:27.208,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Now, we did this in the past.

180
0:09:28.875,000 --> 0:09:29,000
After World War II,

181
0:09:30.417,000 --> 0:09:33,000
when Japan and Germany were devastated after the war,

182
0:09:33.625,000 --> 0:09:38,000
United States of America gave many tax dollars to those two countries,

183
0:09:39.042,000 --> 0:09:43,000
so that they can rebuild their economies and rebuild their corporations.

184
0:09:43.542,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And we can do that again.

185
0:09:46.083,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And if we can think about how we can help these other countries.

186
0:09:49.125,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And I want to give an example

187
0:09:50.583,000 --> 0:09:52,000
of issues that we are facing in the United States of America,

188
0:09:53.5,000 --> 0:09:54,000
for instance.

189
0:09:54.792,000 --> 0:09:55,000
We know that right now

190
0:09:56.125,000 --> 0:09:58,000
we have a lot of refugees from Central America

191
0:09:58.792,000 --> 0:10:,000
that are at the border of the United States.

192
0:10:01.167,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Why do people leave their homes,

193
0:10:03.708,000 --> 0:10:05,000
their beautiful homes that we go to as tourists?

194
0:10:06.167,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Because they don't have opportunities there.

195
0:10:08.375,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And then we think, "Hm, bananas."

196
0:10:11.583,000 --> 0:10:15,000
How many jillions of bananas do we consume in the United States every single day?

197
0:10:15.875,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And throughout the world.

198
0:10:17.667,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Now, do the people in Central America

199
0:10:19.792,000 --> 0:10:22,000
get the profits from the bananas that we consume?

200
0:10:23.042,000 --> 0:10:24,000
No, they don't.

201
0:10:24.458,000 --> 0:10:28,000
The profits go to corporations from the United States of America.

202
0:10:29.25,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And we think that this is wrong.

203
0:10:31.083,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Now, if the people in Central America were to be able to get some of that money

204
0:10:36.208,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that we pay for bananas,

205
0:10:37.875,000 --> 0:10:39,000
then they wouldn't have to leave their homes.

206
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:42,000
They wouldn't have to come as asylum seekers

207
0:10:42.625,000 --> 0:10:44,000
to the borders of the United States of America.

208
0:10:44.893,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And then maybe, many children would not have to be separated from their parents.

209
0:10:50.458,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Now, we know that there are countries in the world

210
0:10:53.208,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that actually have free education and have free health care

211
0:10:57.083,000 --> 0:10:59,000
for all of the people in their country.

212
0:10:59.417,000 --> 0:11:,000
And that country is Cuba.

213
0:11:01.375,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Cuba has health care for every one of their citizens,

214
0:11:04.083,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and they have a free college education for every one of their citizens.

215
0:11:08.167,000 --> 0:11:09,000
They're 11 million citizens.

216
0:11:10.042,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Now, we think, if a poor country like Cuba

217
0:11:13.208,000 --> 0:11:17,000
can have these kind of resources, and we know that they're a poor country,

218
0:11:17.375,000 --> 0:11:19,000
then why can't some of the other wealthier countries,

219
0:11:19.958,000 --> 0:11:2,000
like the United States of America,

220
0:11:21.625,000 --> 0:11:22,000
do the same?

221
0:11:22.917,000 --> 0:11:23,000
I think that we can make that happen.

222
0:11:24.75,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Applause)

223
0:11:28.167,000 --> 0:11:29,000
But we know it's not going to happen

224
0:11:29.958,000 --> 0:11:32,000
until we, the people of the United States of America,

225
0:11:33.792,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and people throughout the world,

226
0:11:35.375,000 --> 0:11:39,000
start making sure that they get public officials elected to their governments

227
0:11:40.25,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that really care about the constituents, they care about people,

228
0:11:44.167,000 --> 0:11:47,000
they will commit to make sure that the resources that they have

229
0:11:47.417,000 --> 0:11:51,000
are going to be used for their citizens, and not to be used for war.

230
0:11:51.542,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So, how do we make this happen?

231
0:11:53.958,000 --> 0:11:54,000
We have to get rid of the apathy,

232
0:11:55.667,000 --> 0:11:56,000
we have to get more people involved.

233
0:11:57.625,000 --> 0:12:,000
We know that if we can't have a democracy in the United States,

234
0:12:01.542,000 --> 0:12:03,000
we can't have democracies throughout the world,

235
0:12:03.792,000 --> 0:12:04,000
unless people participate.

236
0:12:05.375,000 --> 0:12:09,000
So it is imperative that all of us get out there and we say,

237
0:12:09.917,000 --> 0:12:12,000
"Get rid of the apathy, get off of the sidewalk,

238
0:12:13.125,000 --> 0:12:15,000
come and join the march for peace and justice,

239
0:12:15.542,000 --> 0:12:17,000
let's make Coretta Scott's vision a reality,

240
0:12:18.417,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to have peace in the world."

241
0:12:20.042,000 --> 0:12:23,000
We recently had midterm elections in the United States of America.

242
0:12:23.542,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And what did we see?

243
0:12:25.167,000 --> 0:12:27,000
We saw that so many more women,

244
0:12:27.75,000 --> 0:12:3,000
young people, people of color, LGBT folks,

245
0:12:30.875,000 --> 0:12:31,000
were all elected to public office.

246
0:12:32.833,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And we know this happened -- why?

247
0:12:34.792,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Because so many women were on the march.

248
0:12:37.708,000 --> 0:12:39,000
We had the Women's March in the United States.

249
0:12:40.333,000 --> 0:12:42,000
They had the Women's Marches all over the world.

250
0:12:42.708,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And so we now see that we have this potential.

251
0:12:46.333,000 --> 0:12:48,000
We have this potential to get rid of the apathy.

252
0:12:48.667,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And if we get everyone involved, get everyone committed,

253
0:12:52.375,000 --> 0:12:55,000
then, I think, we can make Coretta Scott's vision come true.

254
0:12:56.125,000 --> 0:12:58,000
So, I want to just remind everybody,

255
0:12:58.792,000 --> 0:13:,000
throughout the world, one of the things is,

256
0:13:01.625,000 --> 0:13:02,000
we have power,

257
0:13:03.417,000 --> 0:13:04,000
poor people have power,

258
0:13:05.083,000 --> 0:13:06,000
every citizen has power.

259
0:13:06.833,000 --> 0:13:11,000
But in order to achieve the peace that we all yearn for,

260
0:13:11.958,000 --> 0:13:12,000
then we've all got to get involved.

261
0:13:13.75,000 --> 0:13:15,000
So, what do we say?

262
0:13:15.792,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Can we do it?

263
0:13:17.083,000 --> 0:13:18,000
We say, "Yes, we can!"

264
0:13:18.417,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And in Spanish, we say, "Sí, se puede."

265
0:13:20.583,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Thank you very much.

266
0:13:21.917,000 --> 0:13:25,000
(Applause)

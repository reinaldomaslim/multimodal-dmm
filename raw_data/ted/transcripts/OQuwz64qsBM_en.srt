1
0:00:12.197,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Alright, let's get this kicked off.

2
0:00:15.486,000 --> 0:00:17,000
(Music)

3
0:00:17.54,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Singing) It's OK to be gay.

4
0:00:20.843,000 --> 0:00:23,000
We are different in many ways.

5
0:00:24.095,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Doesn't matter if you're a boy, girl or somewhere in between,

6
0:00:28.239,000 --> 0:00:32,000
we all are part of one big family.

7
0:00:34.047,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Gay means "happy."

8
0:00:37.896,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Queer Kid Stuff.

9
0:00:41.405,000 --> 0:00:42,000
You are enough

10
0:00:43.073,000 --> 0:00:46,000
here at Queer Kid Stuff.

11
0:00:46.872,000 --> 0:00:49,000
(Applause)

12
0:00:53.555,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Opening a performance with lyrics like "It's OK to be gay"

13
0:00:56.732,000 --> 0:00:58,000
for a roomful of adults is one thing,

14
0:00:59.399,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but it's entirely different for a roomful of kindergartners.

15
0:01:03.66,000 --> 0:01:07,000
What you've just heard is the theme song for my web series "Queer Kid Stuff,"

16
0:01:07.698,000 --> 0:01:11,000
where I make LGBTQ+ and social justice videos for all ages.

17
0:01:12.294,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And when I say all ages, I mean literal babies

18
0:01:16.08,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to your great-great-grandma.

19
0:01:19.322,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Now, I know what you're thinking:

20
0:01:22.085,000 --> 0:01:25,000
"Whoa, they're talking about gay stuff with kids."

21
0:01:25.412,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But talking to kids about gay stuff is actually crucial.

22
0:01:29.97,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The American Academy of Pediatrics has found

23
0:01:32.186,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that children have a solid understanding of their gender identity

24
0:01:35.813,000 --> 0:01:36,000
by the age of four.

25
0:01:38.425,000 --> 0:01:4,000
This is when children are developing their sense of self.

26
0:01:41.155,000 --> 0:01:43,000
They're observing the world around them,

27
0:01:43.299,000 --> 0:01:44,000
absorbing that information

28
0:01:44.633,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and internalizing it.

29
0:01:46.648,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Now, most parents want their children to become kind, empathetic,

30
0:01:50.837,000 --> 0:01:51,000
self-confident adults,

31
0:01:52.452,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and exposure to diversity is an important part

32
0:01:55.836,000 --> 0:01:57,000
of that social and emotional development.

33
0:01:59.093,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And -- gender nonconforming kids

34
0:02:01.684,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and trans kids and kids with trans and nonbinary and queer parents

35
0:02:07.011,000 --> 0:02:09,000
are everywhere.

36
0:02:12.054,000 --> 0:02:16,000
In the series, my stuffed bear cohost and I talk about the LGBT community,

37
0:02:17.054,000 --> 0:02:19,000
activism, gender and pronouns,

38
0:02:19.129,000 --> 0:02:21,000
consent and body positivity.

39
0:02:21.713,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We tackle these topics through songs,

40
0:02:24.301,000 --> 0:02:25,000
not unlike the one you just heard,

41
0:02:26.244,000 --> 0:02:28,000
simple definitions and metaphors.

42
0:02:28.936,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We approach these ideas, to steal a phrase from an old professor of mine,

43
0:02:32.88,000 --> 0:02:34,000
from "under the doorknob" --

44
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:36,000
getting down to toddler height

45
0:02:36.748,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and looking up at the great big world through their tiny little eyes,

46
0:02:41.728,000 --> 0:02:45,000
taking these seemingly complex ideas and simplifying them --

47
0:02:46.3,000 --> 0:02:47,000
not dumbing them down,

48
0:02:47.559,000 --> 0:02:49,000
but homing in on the core concept.

49
0:02:50.394,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Gender is about how we feel and how we express ourselves.

50
0:02:53.942,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Sexuality is about love and gender and family,

51
0:02:57.39,000 --> 0:02:58,000
not about sex.

52
0:02:58.845,000 --> 0:03:,000
And these are all ideas children can grasp.

53
0:03:01.758,000 --> 0:03:03,000
In one of my earliest episodes about gender,

54
0:03:03.876,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I used the idea of pronouns

55
0:03:05.811,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to underscore the definition and introduce gender-neutral pronouns

56
0:03:08.954,000 --> 0:03:09,000
like "they" and "them."

57
0:03:10.463,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I encourage children to think about their own pronouns

58
0:03:13.287,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and to ask others for theirs.

59
0:03:16.27,000 --> 0:03:18,000
In later episodes, I build on this foundation

60
0:03:19.057,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and introduce big fancy words like "nonbinary" and "transgender."

61
0:03:24.02,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I get emails from viewers in their 20s

62
0:03:26.162,000 --> 0:03:3,000
who use my videos to explain nonbinary gender to their grandparents.

63
0:03:32.573,000 --> 0:03:37,000
But, I get one comment over and over again:

64
0:03:38.858,000 --> 0:03:4,000
"Let kids be kids."

65
0:03:42.319,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Well, that's a nice sentiment and all,

66
0:03:44.97,000 --> 0:03:48,000
but only if it actually includes all kids.

67
0:03:51.495,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Just a few weeks ago,

68
0:03:53.432,000 --> 0:03:55,000
a 15-year-old in Huntsville, Alabama

69
0:03:56.282,000 --> 0:03:59,000
died by suicide after being bullied for being gay.

70
0:04:00.893,000 --> 0:04:04,000
In 2018, it was a seven-year-old

71
0:04:05.368,000 --> 0:04:06,000
in Denver, Colorado.

72
0:04:08.192,000 --> 0:04:11,000
There have been and will be many more.

73
0:04:12.869,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Lesbian, gay and bisexual teens

74
0:04:14.636,000 --> 0:04:17,000
are more than three times more likely to attempt suicide

75
0:04:17.99,000 --> 0:04:18,000
than their heterosexual peers,

76
0:04:19.828,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and transgender teens are almost six times more likely.

77
0:04:25.283,000 --> 0:04:28,000
According to one study, roughly one third of homeless youth

78
0:04:28.412,000 --> 0:04:31,000
identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or questioning,

79
0:04:31.865,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and about four percent of homeless youth identify as transgender,

80
0:04:36.158,000 --> 0:04:4,000
compared with one percent of the general youth population surveyed.

81
0:04:41.637,000 --> 0:04:43,000
According to the Human Rights Campaign,

82
0:04:44.209,000 --> 0:04:49,000
there have been 128 killings of trans people

83
0:04:49.843,000 --> 0:04:52,000
in 87 cities across 32 states

84
0:04:53.413,000 --> 0:04:54,000
since 2013.

85
0:04:55.053,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And those are the only the reported cases.

86
0:04:59.613,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And 80 percent of those killings were of trans women of color.

87
0:05:06.082,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The queer situation is bleak,

88
0:05:10.203,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to say the least.

89
0:05:12.601,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The YouTube comments on my videos

90
0:05:14.67,000 --> 0:05:16,000
are not much better.

91
0:05:17.822,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I'm used to the harassment.

92
0:05:19.424,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I get messages daily telling me I'm a pedophile

93
0:05:22.438,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and that I should kill myself in a number of increasingly creative ways.

94
0:05:26.917,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I once had to put the word "truck" on my block list

95
0:05:29.464,000 --> 0:05:31,000
because someone wanted me to get run over by a truck.

96
0:05:32.455,000 --> 0:05:34,000
"Shower" and "oven" are in there, too,

97
0:05:34.548,000 --> 0:05:38,000
for the less creative and more disturbing Holocaust reference.

98
0:05:39.656,000 --> 0:05:41,000
When neo-Nazis marched in Charlottesville,

99
0:05:42.417,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I was unsurprised to learn

100
0:05:44.421,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that the creator of a violent Reddit meme about one of my episodes

101
0:05:48.08,000 --> 0:05:5,000
was in the tiki torch crowd.

102
0:05:52.074,000 --> 0:05:55,000
This barrage of negativity is what we're up against:

103
0:05:55.543,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the crushing statistics, the violence, the mental health risks,

104
0:05:59.328,000 --> 0:06:03,000
the well-meaning but flawed response my parents gave me when I came out,

105
0:06:04.225,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that they didn't want me to have a harder life.

106
0:06:07.683,000 --> 0:06:08,000
That's what we're up against.

107
0:06:10.589,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But in the face of all that,

108
0:06:13.654,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I choose joy.

109
0:06:16.147,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I choose rainbows and unicorns and glitter,

110
0:06:19.693,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and I sing that it's OK to be gay with my childhood stuffed teddy bear.

111
0:06:26.079,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I make queer media for kids

112
0:06:27.5,000 --> 0:06:3,000
because I wish I had this when I was their age.

113
0:06:31.511,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I make it so others don't have to struggle through what I did,

114
0:06:35.002,000 --> 0:06:36,000
not understanding my identity

115
0:06:36.635,000 --> 0:06:39,000
because I didn't have any exposure to who I could be.

116
0:06:41.208,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I teach and spread this message through joy and positivity

117
0:06:45.288,000 --> 0:06:48,000
instead of framing it around the hardships of queer life.

118
0:06:48.931,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I want kids to grow up and into themselves

119
0:06:51.38,000 --> 0:06:54,000
with pride for who they are and who they can be,

120
0:06:54.873,000 --> 0:06:57,000
no matter who they love or what they wear or what pronouns they use.

121
0:06:58.689,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And I want them to love others for their differences,

122
0:07:02.679,000 --> 0:07:03,000
not in spite of them.

123
0:07:05.387,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I think fostering this pride and empathy

124
0:07:08.84,000 --> 0:07:12,000
will make the world a kinder and more equal place

125
0:07:13.293,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and combat the bigotry and hate that festers in our world.

126
0:07:20.154,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So, talk to a kid about gender.

127
0:07:25.174,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Talk to a kid about sexuality.

128
0:07:27.459,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Teach them about consent.

129
0:07:29.244,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Tell them it is OK for boys to wear dresses

130
0:07:32.344,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and for girls to speak up.

131
0:07:35.499,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Let's spread radical queer joy.

132
0:07:40.558,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Thank you.

133
0:07:41.752,000 --> 0:07:43,000
(Applause)

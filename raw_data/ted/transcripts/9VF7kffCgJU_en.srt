1
0:00:12.634,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I consider it my life's mission

2
0:00:15.877,000 --> 0:00:18,000
to convey the urgency of climate change through my work.

3
0:00:19.961,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I've traveled north to the Arctic to the capture the unfolding story

4
0:00:23.726,000 --> 0:00:24,000
of polar melt,

5
0:00:25.229,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and south to the Equator to document the subsequent rising seas.

6
0:00:29.903,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Most recently, I visited the icy coast of Greenland

7
0:00:33.617,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and the low-lying islands of the Maldives,

8
0:00:36.507,000 --> 0:00:4,000
connecting two seemingly disparate but equally endangered

9
0:00:41.008,000 --> 0:00:42,000
parts of our planet.

10
0:00:43.504,000 --> 0:00:49,000
My drawings explore moments of transition, turbulence

11
0:00:49.571,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and tranquility in the landscape,

12
0:00:52.309,000 --> 0:00:55,000
allowing viewers to emotionally connect

13
0:00:55.815,000 --> 0:00:57,000
with a place you might never have the chance to visit.

14
0:00:59.185,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I choose to convey the beauty as opposed to the devastation.

15
0:01:04.23,000 --> 0:01:08,000
If you can experience the sublimity of these landscapes,

16
0:01:08.686,000 --> 0:01:11,000
perhaps you'll be inspired to protect and preserve them.

17
0:01:13.545,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Behavioral psychology tells us that we take action

18
0:01:16.936,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and make decisions based on our emotions above all else.

19
0:01:21.497,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And studies have shown that art impacts our emotions

20
0:01:24.957,000 --> 0:01:27,000
more effectively than a scary news report.

21
0:01:29.193,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Experts predict ice-free Arctic summers

22
0:01:32.661,000 --> 0:01:34,000
as early as 2020.

23
0:01:35.521,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And sea levels are likely to rise between two and ten feet

24
0:01:39.712,000 --> 0:01:4,000
by century's end.

25
0:01:42.364,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I have dedicated my career to illuminating these projections

26
0:01:47.064,000 --> 0:01:49,000
with an accessible medium,

27
0:01:49.152,000 --> 0:01:53,000
one that moves us in a way that statistics may not.

28
0:01:54.684,000 --> 0:01:56,000
My process begins with traveling to the places

29
0:01:57.387,000 --> 0:01:59,000
at the forefront of climate change.

30
0:01:59.71,000 --> 0:02:01,000
On-site, I take thousands of photographs.

31
0:02:02.696,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Back in the studio,

32
0:02:03.963,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I work from both my memory of the experience and the photographs

33
0:02:08.247,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to create very large-scale compositions,

34
0:02:10.526,000 --> 0:02:12,000
sometimes over 10 feet wide.

35
0:02:13.412,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I draw with soft pastel, which is dry like charcoal, but colors.

36
0:02:18.456,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I consider my work drawings but others call them painting.

37
0:02:22.203,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I cringe, though, when I'm referred to as a "finger painter."

38
0:02:26.248,000 --> 0:02:27,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:27.39,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But I don't use any tools

40
0:02:29.719,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and I have always used my fingers and palms

41
0:02:32.22,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to manipulate the pigment on the paper.

42
0:02:35.99,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Drawing is a form of meditation for me.

43
0:02:40.354,000 --> 0:02:41,000
It quiets my mind.

44
0:02:42.437,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I don't perceive what I'm drawing

45
0:02:44.268,000 --> 0:02:45,000
as ice or water.

46
0:02:45.665,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Instead, the image is stripped down

47
0:02:48.151,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to its most basic form of color and shape.

48
0:02:52.964,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Once the piece is complete,

49
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I can finally experience the composition as a whole,

50
0:02:57.49,000 --> 0:02:59,000
as an iceberg floating through glassy water,

51
0:03:00.076,000 --> 0:03:02,000
or a wave cresting with foam.

52
0:03:03.884,000 --> 0:03:06,000
On average, a piece this size takes me about,

53
0:03:07.83,000 --> 0:03:08,000
as you can see, 10 seconds.

54
0:03:09.544,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Laughter)

55
0:03:11.348,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Applause)

56
0:03:15.336,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Really, more like 200 hours, 250 hours for something that size.

57
0:03:19.816,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But I've been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon, really.

58
0:03:22.822,000 --> 0:03:23,000
My mom was an artist, and growing up,

59
0:03:24.759,000 --> 0:03:26,000
we always had art supplies all over the house.

60
0:03:27.269,000 --> 0:03:29,000
My mother's love of photography

61
0:03:29.846,000 --> 0:03:32,000
propelled her to the most remote regions of the earth,

62
0:03:33.405,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and my family and I were fortunate enough

63
0:03:35.835,000 --> 0:03:37,000
to join and support her on these adventures.

64
0:03:39.139,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We rode camels in Northern Africa

65
0:03:41.871,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and mushed on dog sleds near the North Pole.

66
0:03:45.871,000 --> 0:03:49,000
In August of 2012, I led my first expedition,

67
0:03:50.091,000 --> 0:03:54,000
taking a group of artists and scholars up the northwest coast of Greenland.

68
0:03:56.232,000 --> 0:03:58,000
My mother was originally supposed to lead this trip.

69
0:03:59.146,000 --> 0:04:01,000
She and I were in the early stages of planning,

70
0:04:01.885,000 --> 0:04:03,000
as we had intended to go together,

71
0:04:04.471,000 --> 0:04:06,000
when she fell victim to a brain tumor.

72
0:04:07.812,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The cancer quickly took over her body and mind,

73
0:04:11.833,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and she passed away six months later.

74
0:04:15.11,000 --> 0:04:16,000
During the months of her illness, though,

75
0:04:17.119,000 --> 0:04:22,000
her dedication to the expedition never wavered, and I made a promise

76
0:04:22.643,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to carry out her final journey.

77
0:04:25.374,000 --> 0:04:28,000
My mother's passion for the Arctic

78
0:04:28.541,000 --> 0:04:31,000
echoed through my experience in Greenland,

79
0:04:31.938,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and I felt the power

80
0:04:34.938,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and the fragility of the landscape.

81
0:04:38.738,000 --> 0:04:4,000
The sheer size of the icebergs

82
0:04:41.422,000 --> 0:04:42,000
is humbling.

83
0:04:43.168,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The ice fields are alive with movement and sound

84
0:04:46.615,000 --> 0:04:48,000
in a way that I never expected.

85
0:04:49.284,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I expanded the scale of my compositions

86
0:04:51.556,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to give you that same sense of awe that I experienced.

87
0:04:57.021,000 --> 0:05:,000
Yet, while the grandeur of the ice is evident,

88
0:05:00.74,000 --> 0:05:01,000
so, too, is its vulnerability.

89
0:05:03.042,000 --> 0:05:04,000
From our boat,

90
0:05:04.281,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I could see the ice sweating under the unseasonably warm sun.

91
0:05:10.94,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We had a chance to visit many of the Inuit communities in Greenland

92
0:05:14.527,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that now face huge challenges.

93
0:05:17.381,000 --> 0:05:2,000
The locals spoke to me of vast areas of sea ice

94
0:05:20.721,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that are no longer freezing over as they once did.

95
0:05:23.431,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And without ice, their hunting and harvesting grounds

96
0:05:26.533,000 --> 0:05:27,000
are severely diminished,

97
0:05:28.319,000 --> 0:05:3,000
threatening their way of life and survival.

98
0:05:32.616,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The melting glaciers in Greenland

99
0:05:34.535,000 --> 0:05:38,000
are one of the largest contributing factors to rising sea levels,

100
0:05:38.903,000 --> 0:05:4,000
which have already begun to drown

101
0:05:41.043,000 --> 0:05:43,000
some of our world's lowest-lying islands.

102
0:05:44.942,000 --> 0:05:47,000
One year after my trip to Greenland, I visited the Maldives,

103
0:05:49.145,000 --> 0:05:52,000
the lowest and flattest country in the entire world.

104
0:05:52.752,000 --> 0:05:56,000
While I was there, I collected images and inspiration

105
0:05:56.809,000 --> 0:05:57,000
for a new body of work:

106
0:05:59.072,000 --> 0:06:03,000
drawings of waves lapping on the coast of a nation

107
0:06:03.129,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that could be entirely underwater within this century.

108
0:06:09.484,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Devastating events happen every day

109
0:06:13.051,000 --> 0:06:16,000
on scales both global and personal.

110
0:06:16.844,000 --> 0:06:17,000
When I was in Greenland,

111
0:06:18.131,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I scattered my mother's ashes amidst the melting ice.

112
0:06:22.743,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Now she remains a part of the landscape she loved so much,

113
0:06:27.854,000 --> 0:06:31,000
even as it, too, passes and takes on new form.

114
0:06:33.095,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Among the many gifts my mother gave me

115
0:06:35.887,000 --> 0:06:38,000
was the ability to focus on the positive,

116
0:06:38.911,000 --> 0:06:39,000
rather than the negative.

117
0:06:41.083,000 --> 0:06:47,000
My drawings celebrate the beauty of what we all stand to lose.

118
0:06:47.845,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I hope they can serve as records of sublime landscapes in flux,

119
0:06:53.663,000 --> 0:06:57,000
documenting the transition and inspiring our global community

120
0:06:58.309,000 --> 0:07:,000
to take action for the future.

121
0:07:01.102,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Thank you.

122
0:07:02.333,000 --> 0:07:12,000
(Applause)

Mark Miskin: This is a rotifer.

3
0:00:15.524,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It's a microorganism about a hair's width in size.

4
0:00:18.722,000 --> 0:00:21,000
They live everywhere on earth -- saltwater, freshwater, everywhere --

5
0:00:22.432,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and this one is out looking for food.

6
0:00:25.609,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I remember the first time I saw this thing,

7
0:00:27.659,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I was like eight years old and it completely blew me away.

8
0:00:30.413,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I mean, here is this incredible little creature,

9
0:00:32.7,000 --> 0:00:33,000
it's hunting, swimming,

10
0:00:34.324,000 --> 0:00:35,000
going about its life,

11
0:00:35.613,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but its whole universe fits within a drop of pond water.

12
0:00:40.251,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Paul McEuen: So this little rotifer shows us something really amazing.

13
0:00:43.677,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It says that you can build a machine

14
0:00:45.749,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that is functional, complex, smart,

15
0:00:49.158,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but all in a tiny little package,

16
0:00:51.7,000 --> 0:00:54,000
one so small that it's impossible to see it.

17
0:00:56.134,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Now, the engineer in me is just blown away by this thing,

18
0:00:59.503,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that anyone could make such a creature.

19
0:01:02.309,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But right behind that wonder, I have to admit, is a bit of envy.

20
0:01:06.578,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I mean, nature can do it. Why can't we?

21
0:01:10.518,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Why can't we build tiny robots?

22
0:01:13.205,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Well, I'm not the only one to have this idea.

23
0:01:15.611,000 --> 0:01:17,000
In fact, in the last, oh, few years,

24
0:01:18.294,000 --> 0:01:2,000
researchers around the world have taken up the task

25
0:01:21.271,000 --> 0:01:23,000
of trying to build robots

26
0:01:23.37,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that are so small that they can't be seen.

27
0:01:26.79,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And what we're going to tell you about today

28
0:01:28.902,000 --> 0:01:29,000
is an effort at Cornell University

29
0:01:30.774,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and now at the University of Pennsylvania

30
0:01:33.106,000 --> 0:01:35,000
to try to build tiny robots.

31
0:01:36.064,000 --> 0:01:37,000
OK, so that's the goal.

32
0:01:38.523,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But how do we do it?

33
0:01:40.503,000 --> 0:01:42,000
How do we go about building tiny robots?

34
0:01:43.348,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Well, Pablo Picasso, of all people, gives us our first clue.

35
0:01:47.651,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Picasso said --

["Good artists copy, great artists steal."]

38

"Good artists copy. Great artists steal."

39

(Laughter)

40
0:01:55.788,000 --> 0:01:57,000
OK. But steal from what?

41
0:01:58.279,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Well, believe it or not,

42
0:01:59.551,000 --> 0:02:03,000
most of the technology you need to build a tiny robot already exists.

43
0:02:04.208,000 --> 0:02:06,000
The semiconductor industry has been getting better and better

44
0:02:07.145,000 --> 0:02:09,000
at making tinier and tinier devices,

45
0:02:09.299,000 --> 0:02:12,000
so at this point they could put something like a million transistors

46
0:02:13.2,000 --> 0:02:15,000
into the size of a package that is occupied by, say,

47
0:02:16.043,000 --> 0:02:18,000
a single-celled paramecium.

48
0:02:19.12,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And it's not just electronics.

49
0:02:21.284,000 --> 0:02:22,000
They can also build little sensors,

50
0:02:23.132,000 --> 0:02:24,000
LEDs,

51
0:02:24.327,000 --> 0:02:27,000
whole communication packages that are too small to be seen.

52
0:02:28.961,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So that's what we're going to do.

53
0:02:30.575,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We're going to steal that technology.

54
0:02:32.762,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Here's a robot.

55
0:02:33.961,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:35.607,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Robot's got two parts, as it turns out.

57
0:02:37.807,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It's got a head, and it's got legs.

[Steal these: Brains]

59

(Laughter)

60
0:02:44.512,000 --> 0:02:46,000
We're going to call this a legless robot,

61
0:02:47.413,000 --> 0:02:48,000
which may sound exotic,

62
0:02:49.069,000 --> 0:02:51,000
but they're pretty cool all by themselves.

63
0:02:51.799,000 --> 0:02:54,000
In fact, most of you have a legless robot with you right now.

64
0:02:55.571,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Your smartphone is the world's most successful legless robot.

65
0:03:00.204,000 --> 0:03:03,000
In just 15 years, it has taken over the entire planet.

66
0:03:04.009,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And why not?

67
0:03:05.266,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It's such a beautiful little machine.

68
0:03:07.549,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It's incredibly intelligent,

69
0:03:09.169,000 --> 0:03:11,000
it's got great communication skills,

70
0:03:11.221,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and it's all in a package that you can hold in your hand.

71
0:03:14.517,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So we would like to be able to build something like this,

72
0:03:17.268,000 --> 0:03:19,000
only down at the cellular scale,

73
0:03:19.375,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the size of a paramecium.

74
0:03:21.165,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And here it is.

75
0:03:22.611,000 --> 0:03:24,000
This is our cell-sized smartphone.

76
0:03:25.264,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It even kind of looks like a smartphone,

77
0:03:27.373,000 --> 0:03:3,000
only it's about 10,000 times smaller.

78
0:03:30.461,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We call it an OWIC.

0:03:32.374,000 --> 0:03:34,000
[Optical Wireless Integrated Circuits]

80
0:03:35.307,000 --> 0:03:36,000
OK, we're not advertisers, all right?

81
0:03:37.269,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Laughter)

82
0:03:40.31,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But it's pretty cool all by itself.

83
0:03:42.246,000 --> 0:03:44,000
In fact, this OWIC has a number of parts.

84
0:03:44.496,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So up near the top,

85
0:03:46.033,000 --> 0:03:49,000
there are these cool little solar cells that you shine light on the device

86
0:03:49.572,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and it wakes up a little circuit that's there in the middle.

87
0:03:52.424,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And that circuit can drive a little tiny LED

88
0:03:54.567,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that can blink at you and allows the OWIC to communicate with you.

89
0:03:58.062,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So unlike your cell phone,

90
0:03:59.478,000 --> 0:04:,000
the OWIC communicates with light,

91
0:04:01.23,000 --> 0:04:03,000
sort of like a tiny firefly.

92
0:04:04.342,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Now, one thing that's pretty cool about these OWICs

93
0:04:06.803,000 --> 0:04:07,000
is we don't make them one at a time,

94
0:04:08.57,000 --> 0:04:09,000
soldering all the pieces together.

95
0:04:10.639,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We make them in massive parallel.

96
0:04:12.91,000 --> 0:04:14,000
For example, about a million of these OWICs

97
0:04:15.31,000 --> 0:04:17,000
can fit on a single four-inch wafer.

98
0:04:18.29,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And just like your phone has different apps,

99
0:04:20.419,000 --> 0:04:21,000
you can have different kinds of OWICs.

100
0:04:22.269,000 --> 0:04:24,000
There can be ones that, say, measure voltage,

101
0:04:24.418,000 --> 0:04:25,000
some that measure temperature,

102
0:04:25.9,000 --> 0:04:28,000
or just have a little light that can blink at you to tell you that it's there.

103
0:04:29.645,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So that's pretty cool, these tiny little devices.

104
0:04:33.385,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And I'd like to tell you about them in a little more detail.

105
0:04:36.444,000 --> 0:04:38,000
But first, I have to tell you about something else.

106
0:04:39.334,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I'm going to tell you a few things about pennies that you might not know.

107
0:04:42.822,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So this one is a little bit older penny.

108
0:04:44.813,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It's got a picture of the Lincoln Memorial on the back.

109
0:04:47.437,000 --> 0:04:48,000
But the first thing you might not know,

110
0:04:49.334,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that if you zoom in, you'll find in the center of this thing

111
0:04:52.298,000 --> 0:04:53,000
you can actually see Abraham Lincoln,

112
0:04:54.178,000 --> 0:04:56,000
just like in the real Lincoln Memorial not so far from here.

113
0:04:57.074,000 --> 0:04:58,000
What I'm sure you don't know,

114
0:04:58.885,000 --> 0:05:,000
that if you zoom in even further --

115
0:05:01.135,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:02.603,000 --> 0:05:06,000
you'll see that there's actually an OWIC on Abe Lincoln's chest.

117
0:05:06.684,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Laughter)

118
0:05:09.282,000 --> 0:05:1,000
But the cool thing is,

119
0:05:10.972,000 --> 0:05:13,000
you could stare at this all day long and you would never see it.

120
0:05:15.377,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It's invisible to the naked eye.

121
0:05:17.232,000 --> 0:05:18,000
These OWICs are so small,

122
0:05:18.838,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and we make them in such parallel fashion,

123
0:05:21.353,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that each OWIC costs actually less than a penny.

124
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
In fact, the most expensive thing in this demo is that little sticker

125
0:05:28.696,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that says "OWIC."

126
0:05:30.037,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Laughter)

127
0:05:34.879,000 --> 0:05:36,000
That cost about eight cents.

128
0:05:36.956,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Laughter)

129
0:05:40.266,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Now, we're very excited about these things for all sorts of reasons.

130
0:05:43.589,000 --> 0:05:46,000
For example, we can use them as little tiny secure smart tags,

131
0:05:46.78,000 --> 0:05:47,000
more identifying than a fingerprint.

132
0:05:48.756,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We're actually putting them inside of other medical instruments

133
0:05:51.762,000 --> 0:05:52,000
to give other information,

134
0:05:53.032,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and even starting to think about putting them in the brain

135
0:05:55.822,000 --> 0:05:56,000
to listen to neurons one at a time.

136
0:05:57.591,000 --> 0:05:59,000
In fact, there's only one thing wrong with these OWICs:

137
0:06:01.574,000 --> 0:06:02,000
it's not a robot.

138
0:06:02.904,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It's just a head.

139
0:06:04.264,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Laughter)

140
0:06:05.407,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And I think we'll all agree

141
0:06:07.28,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that half a robot really isn't a robot at all.

142
0:06:11.553,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Without the legs, we've got basically nothing.

143
0:06:14.837,000 --> 0:06:17,000
MM: OK, so you need the legs, too, if you want to build a robot.

144
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Now, here it turns out you can't just steal

145
0:06:20.608,000 --> 0:06:21,000
some preexisting technology.

146
0:06:22.552,000 --> 0:06:26,000
If you want legs for your tiny robot, you need actuators, parts that move.

147
0:06:26.994,000 --> 0:06:28,000
They have to satisfy a lot of different requirements.

148
0:06:29.486,000 --> 0:06:3,000
They need to be low voltage.

149
0:06:31.44,000 --> 0:06:32,000
They need to be low power, too.

150
0:06:32.979,000 --> 0:06:34,000
But most importantly, they have to be small.

151
0:06:35.064,000 --> 0:06:38,000
If you want to build a cell-sized robot, you need cell-sized legs.

152
0:06:38.788,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Now, nobody knows how to build that.

153
0:06:40.542,000 --> 0:06:43,000
There was no preexisting technology that meets all of those demands.

154
0:06:43.943,000 --> 0:06:45,000
To make our legs for our tiny robots,

155
0:06:46.429,000 --> 0:06:47,000
we had to make something new.

156
0:06:47.953,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So here's what we built.

157
0:06:49.619,000 --> 0:06:51,000
This is one of our actuators, and I'm applying a voltage to it.

158
0:06:52.6,000 --> 0:06:54,000
When I do, you can see the actuator respond by curling up.

159
0:06:55.61,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Now, this might not look like much,

160
0:06:57.329,000 --> 0:07:,000
but if we were to put a red blood cell up on the screen, it'd be about that big,

161
0:07:01.138,000 --> 0:07:02,000
so these are unbelievably tiny curls.

162
0:07:03.135,000 --> 0:07:04,000
They're unbelievably small,

163
0:07:04.461,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and yet this device can just bend and unbend, no problem, nothing breaks.

164
0:07:08.273,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So how do we do it?

165
0:07:09.45,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Well, the actuator is made from a layer of platinum

166
0:07:11.871,000 --> 0:07:12,000
just a dozen atoms or so thick.

167
0:07:13.386,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Now it turns out, if you take platinum and put it in water

168
0:07:16.198,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and apply a voltage to it,

169
0:07:17.471,000 --> 0:07:19,000
atoms from the water will attach or remove themselves

170
0:07:19.996,000 --> 0:07:2,000
from the surface of the platinum,

171
0:07:21.604,000 --> 0:07:22,000
depending on how much voltage you use.

172
0:07:23.453,000 --> 0:07:24,000
This creates a force,

173
0:07:24.644,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and you can use that force for voltage-controlled actuation.

174
0:07:27.548,000 --> 0:07:29,000
The key here was to make everything ultrathin.

175
0:07:30.459,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Then your actuator is flexible enough

176
0:07:32.251,000 --> 0:07:34,000
to bend to these small sizes without breaking,

177
0:07:34.427,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and it can use the forces that come about

178
0:07:36.41,000 --> 0:07:38,000
from just attaching or removing a single layer of atoms.

179
0:07:39.062,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Now, we don't have to build these one at a time, either.

180
0:07:41.723,000 --> 0:07:42,000
In fact, just like the OWICs,

181
0:07:43.144,000 --> 0:07:45,000
we can build them massively in parallel as well.

182
0:07:45.504,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So here's a couple thousand or so actuators,

183
0:07:47.955,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and all I'm doing is applying a voltage,

184
0:07:50.222,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and they all wave,

185
0:07:51.886,000 --> 0:07:54,000
looking like nothing more than the legs of a future robot army.

186
0:07:55.467,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Laughter)

187
0:07:58.17,000 --> 0:08:,000
So now we've got the brains and we've got the brawn.

188
0:08:00.937,000 --> 0:08:02,000
We've got the smarts and the actuators.

189
0:08:03.4,000 --> 0:08:04,000
The OWICs are the brains.

190
0:08:04.737,000 --> 0:08:06,000
They give us sensors, they give us power supplies,

191
0:08:07.197,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and they give us a two-way communication system via light.

192
0:08:10.076,000 --> 0:08:11,000
The platinum layers are the muscle.

193
0:08:11.79,000 --> 0:08:13,000
They're what's going to move the robot around.

194
0:08:13.975,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Now we can take those two pieces, put them together

195
0:08:16.449,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and start to build our tiny, tiny robots.

196
0:08:18.556,000 --> 0:08:2,000
The first thing we wanted to build was something really simple.

197
0:08:21.557,000 --> 0:08:23,000
This robot walks around under user control.

198
0:08:23.584,000 --> 0:08:26,000
In the middle are some solar cells and some wiring attached to it.

199
0:08:26.71,000 --> 0:08:27,000
That's the OWIC.

200
0:08:27.885,000 --> 0:08:29,000
They're connected to a set of legs which have a platinum layer

201
0:08:30.835,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and these rigid panels that we put on top

202
0:08:32.825,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that tell the legs how to fold up, which shape they should take.

203
0:08:35.856,000 --> 0:08:38,000
The idea is that by shooting a laser at the different solar cells,

204
0:08:39.003,000 --> 0:08:4,000
you can choose which leg you want to move

205
0:08:41.002,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and make the robot walk around.

206
0:08:42.652,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Now, of course, we don't build those one at a time, either.

207
0:08:45.443,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We build them massively in parallel as well.

208
0:08:47.549,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We can build something like one million robots on a single four-inch wafer.

209
0:08:51.138,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So, for example, this image on the left, this is a chip,

210
0:08:53.846,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and this chip has something like 10,000 robots on it.

211
0:08:56.439,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Now, in our world, the macro world,

212
0:08:58.144,000 --> 0:09:01,000
this thing looks like it might be a new microprocessor or something.

213
0:09:01.396,000 --> 0:09:03,000
But if you take that chip and you put it under a microscope,

214
0:09:04.295,000 --> 0:09:07,000
what you're going to see are thousands and thousands of tiny robots.

215
0:09:08.41,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Now, these robots are still stuck down.

216
0:09:10.325,000 --> 0:09:12,000
They're still attached to the surface that we built them on.

217
0:09:13.188,000 --> 0:09:15,000
In order for them to walk around, we have to release them.

218
0:09:15.949,000 --> 0:09:18,000
We wanted to show you how we do that live, how we release the robot army,

219
0:09:19.439,000 --> 0:09:21,000
but the process involves highly dangerous chemicals,

220
0:09:22.363,000 --> 0:09:24,000
like, really nasty stuff,

221
0:09:25.144,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and we're like a mile from the White House right now?

222
0:09:27.701,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Yeah. They wouldn't let us do it.

223
0:09:30.133,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So --

224
0:09:31.315,000 --> 0:09:32,000
(Laughter)

225
0:09:33.269,000 --> 0:09:36,000
so we're going to show you a movie instead. (Laughs)

226
0:09:37.072,000 --> 0:09:4,000
What you're looking at here are the final stages of robot deployment.

227
0:09:40.411,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We're using chemicals

228
0:09:41.59,000 --> 0:09:43,000
to etch the substrate out from underneath the robots.

229
0:09:44.138,000 --> 0:09:47,000
When it dissolves, the robots are free to fold up into their final shapes.

230
0:09:47.689,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Now, you can see here, the yield's about 90 percent,

231
0:09:50.176,000 --> 0:09:52,000
so almost every one of those 10,000 robots we build,

232
0:09:52.833,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that's a robot that we can deploy and control later.

233
0:09:55.705,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And we can take those robots and we can put them places as well.

234
0:09:58.748,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So if you look at the movie on the left, that's some robots in water.

235
0:10:02.035,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I'm going to come along with a pipette,

236
0:10:04.017,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and I can vacuum them all up.

237
0:10:06.571,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Now when you inject the robots back out of that pipette,

238
0:10:09.283,000 --> 0:10:1,000
they're just fine.

239
0:10:10.46,000 --> 0:10:11,000
In fact, these robots are so small,

240
0:10:12.162,000 --> 0:10:15,000
they're small enough to pass through the thinnest hypodermic needle

241
0:10:15.342,000 --> 0:10:16,000
you can buy.

242
0:10:16.52,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Yeah, so if you wanted to,

243
0:10:18.268,000 --> 0:10:2,000
you could inject yourself full of robots.

244
0:10:20.621,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Laughter)

245
0:10:22.733,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I think they're into it.

246
0:10:24.412,000 --> 0:10:25,000
(Laughter)

247
0:10:27.274,000 --> 0:10:29,000
On the right is a robot that we put in some pond water.

248
0:10:30.004,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I want you to wait for just one second.

249
0:10:32.309,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Ooop!

250
0:10:34.157,000 --> 0:10:38,000
You see that? That was no shark. That was a paramecium.

251
0:10:38.409,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So that's the world that these things live in.

252
0:10:40.91,000 --> 0:10:41,000
OK, so this is all well and good,

253
0:10:42.551,000 --> 0:10:44,000
but you might be wondering at this point,

254
0:10:44.594,000 --> 0:10:45,000
"Well, do they walk?"

255
0:10:46.434,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Right? That's what they're supposed to do. They better. So let's find out.

256
0:10:50.75,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So here's the robot and here are its solar cells in the middle.

257
0:10:53.767,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Those are those little rectangles.

258
0:10:55.421,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I want you to look at the solar cell closest to the top of the slide.

259
0:10:58.739,000 --> 0:11:,000
See that little white dot? That's a laser spot.

260
0:11:00.977,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Now watch what happens when we start switching that laser

261
0:11:03.716,000 --> 0:11:05,000
between different solar cells on the robot.

262
0:11:09.567,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Off it goes!

263
0:11:11.024,000 --> 0:11:13,000
(Applause)

264
0:11:13.521,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Yeah!

265
0:11:14.721,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Applause)

266
0:11:20.469,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Off goes the robot marching around the microworld.

267
0:11:23.613,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Now, one of the things that's cool about this movie is:

268
0:11:26.296,000 --> 0:11:28,000
I'm actually piloting the robot in this movie.

269
0:11:28.795,000 --> 0:11:33,000
In fact, for six months, my job was to shoot lasers at tiny cell-sized robots

270
0:11:34.023,000 --> 0:11:36,000
to pilot them around the microworld.

271
0:11:36.21,000 --> 0:11:37,000
This was actually my job.

272
0:11:37.753,000 --> 0:11:4,000
As far as I could tell, that is the coolest job in the world.

273
0:11:40.793,000 --> 0:11:41,000
(Laughter)

274
0:11:42.092,000 --> 0:11:44,000
It was just the feeling of total excitement,

275
0:11:44.433,000 --> 0:11:45,000
like you're doing the impossible.

276
0:11:46.614,000 --> 0:11:49,000
It's a feeling of wonder like that first time I looked through a microscope

277
0:11:50.163,000 --> 0:11:52,000
as a kid staring at that rotifer.

278
0:11:52.392,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Now, I'm a dad, I have a son of my own, and he's about three years old.

279
0:11:56.089,000 --> 0:11:59,000
But one day, he's going to look through a microscope like that one.

280
0:11:59.51,000 --> 0:12:,000
And I often wonder:

281
0:12:01.715,000 --> 0:12:02,000
What is he going to see?

282
0:12:03.716,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Instead of just watching the microworld,

283
0:12:05.805,000 --> 0:12:08,000
we as humans can now build technology to shape it,

284
0:12:09.015,000 --> 0:12:11,000
to interact with it, to engineer it.

285
0:12:12.169,000 --> 0:12:16,000
In 30 years, when my son is my age, what will we do with that ability?

286
0:12:17.334,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Will microrobots live in our bloodstream,

287
0:12:20.614,000 --> 0:12:21,000
as common as bacteria?

288
0:12:22.888,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Will they live on our crops and get rid of pests?

289
0:12:25.878,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Will they tell us when we have infections, or will they fight cancer cell by cell?

290
0:12:31.952,000 --> 0:12:32,000
PM: And one cool part is,

291
0:12:33.373,000 --> 0:12:35,000
you're going to be able to participate in this revolution.

292
0:12:36.157,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Ten years or so from now,

293
0:12:37.4,000 --> 0:12:41,000
when you buy your new iPhone 15x Moto or whatever it's called --

294
0:12:41.725,000 --> 0:12:42,000
(Laughter)

295
0:12:42.765,000 --> 0:12:45,000
it may come with a little jar with a few thousand tiny robots in it

296
0:12:46.155,000 --> 0:12:48,000
that you can control by an app on your cell phone.

297
0:12:49.424,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So if you want to ride a paramecium, go for it.

298
0:12:53.2,000 --> 0:12:57,000
If you want to -- I don't know -- DJ the world's smallest robot dance party,

299
0:12:57.504,000 --> 0:12:58,000
make it happen.

300
0:12:58.688,000 --> 0:12:59,000
(Laughter)

301
0:12:59.737,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And I, for one, am very excited about that day coming.

302
0:13:03.615,000 --> 0:13:04,000
MM: Thank you.

303
0:13:04.876,000 --> 0:13:08,000
(Applause)

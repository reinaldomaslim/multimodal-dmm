Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:15.941,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm here today to talk about a disturbing question,

3
0:00:19.229,000 --> 0:00:22,000
which has an equally disturbing answer.

4
0:00:22.927,000 --> 0:00:25,000
My topic is the secrets of domestic violence,

5
0:00:26.529,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and the question I'm going to tackle

6
0:00:28.863,000 --> 0:00:32,000
is the one question everyone always asks:

7
0:00:32.944,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Why does she stay?

8
0:00:34.556,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her?

9
0:00:38.552,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I'm not a psychiatrist, a social worker

10
0:00:41.529,000 --> 0:00:43,000
or an expert in domestic violence.

11
0:00:43.864,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I'm just one woman with a story to tell.

12
0:00:47.063,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I was 22. I had just graduated from Harvard College.

13
0:00:51.576,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I had moved to New York City for my first job

14
0:00:54.048,000 --> 0:00:57,000
as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine.

15
0:00:57.344,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I had my first apartment,

16
0:00:59.584,000 --> 0:01:02,000
my first little green American Express card,

17
0:01:02.784,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and I had a very big secret.

18
0:01:05.812,000 --> 0:01:08,000
My secret was that I had this gun

19
0:01:09.511,000 --> 0:01:12,000
loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head

20
0:01:12.949,000 --> 0:01:14,000
by the man who I thought was my soulmate,

21
0:01:15.512,000 --> 0:01:18,000
many, many times.

22
0:01:18.997,000 --> 0:01:21,000
The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth

23
0:01:22.557,000 --> 0:01:26,000
held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me

24
0:01:26.636,000 --> 0:01:29,000
more times than I can even remember.

25
0:01:29.821,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I'm here to tell you the story of crazy love,

26
0:01:32.564,000 --> 0:01:35,000
a psychological trap disguised as love,

27
0:01:35.748,000 --> 0:01:37,000
one that millions of women and even a few men

28
0:01:38.6,000 --> 0:01:4,000
fall into every year.

29
0:01:40.981,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It may even be your story.

30
0:01:43.73,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I don't look like a typical domestic violence survivor.

31
0:01:46.773,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College,

32
0:01:49.079,000 --> 0:01:51,000
an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School.

33
0:01:51.441,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I've spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies

34
0:01:54.733,000 --> 0:01:58,000
including Johnson & Johnson, Leo Burnett and The Washington Post.

35
0:01:59.005,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I've been married for almost 20 years to my second husband

36
0:02:02.801,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and we have three kids together.

37
0:02:05.59,000 --> 0:02:09,000
My dog is a black lab, and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan.

38
0:02:09.819,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:12.299,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So my first message for you is that domestic violence

40
0:02:15.018,000 --> 0:02:17,000
happens to everyone --

41
0:02:17.386,000 --> 0:02:21,000
all races, all religions, all income and education levels.

42
0:02:21.562,000 --> 0:02:22,000
It's everywhere.

43
0:02:23.501,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And my second message is that everyone thinks

44
0:02:26.021,000 --> 0:02:28,000
domestic violence happens to women,

45
0:02:28.139,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that it's a women's issue.

46
0:02:30.407,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Not exactly.

47
0:02:32.626,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Over 85 percent of abusers are men, and domestic abuse

48
0:02:36.738,000 --> 0:02:41,000
happens only in intimate, interdependent, long-term relationships,

49
0:02:42.656,000 --> 0:02:44,000
in other words, in families,

50
0:02:44.825,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the last place we would want or expect to find violence,

51
0:02:48.69,000 --> 0:02:52,000
which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing.

52
0:02:52.968,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth

53
0:02:56.519,000 --> 0:02:58,000
who would stay with a man who beats me,

54
0:02:59.091,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age.

55
0:03:02.498,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I was 22, and in the United States,

56
0:03:05.783,000 --> 0:03:08,000
women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely

57
0:03:09.632,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to be domestic violence victims

58
0:03:12.393,000 --> 0:03:14,000
as women of other ages,

59
0:03:15.208,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and over 500 women and girls this age

60
0:03:18.511,000 --> 0:03:21,000
are killed every year by abusive partners,

61
0:03:22.082,000 --> 0:03:26,000
boyfriends, and husbands in the United States.

62
0:03:26.715,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing

63
0:03:29.775,000 --> 0:03:33,000
about domestic violence, its warning signs or its patterns.

64
0:03:34.36,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I met Conor on a cold, rainy January night.

65
0:03:39.425,000 --> 0:03:41,000
He sat next to me on the New York City subway,

66
0:03:42.388,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and he started chatting me up.

67
0:03:44.527,000 --> 0:03:45,000
He told me two things.

68
0:03:46.395,000 --> 0:03:49,000
One was that he, too, had just graduated from an Ivy League school,

69
0:03:50.197,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank.

70
0:03:54.552,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting

71
0:03:58.212,000 --> 0:04:01,000
was that he was smart and funny

72
0:04:01.5,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and he looked like a farm boy.

73
0:04:02.9,000 --> 0:04:04,000
He had these big cheeks, these big apple cheeks

74
0:04:05.247,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and this wheat-blond hair,

75
0:04:06.932,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and he seemed so sweet.

76
0:04:10.219,000 --> 0:04:13,000
One of the smartest things Conor did, from the very beginning,

77
0:04:14.003,000 --> 0:04:19,000
was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship.

78
0:04:19.577,000 --> 0:04:21,000
He did this especially at the beginning

79
0:04:21.778,000 --> 0:04:23,000
by idolizing me.

80
0:04:24.644,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We started dating, and he loved everything about me,

81
0:04:27.93,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that I was smart, that I'd gone to Harvard,

82
0:04:29.614,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that I was passionate about helping teenage girls, and my job.

83
0:04:32.644,000 --> 0:04:34,000
He wanted to know everything about my family

84
0:04:35.175,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and my childhood and my hopes and dreams.

85
0:04:37.791,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Conor believed in me, as a writer and a woman,

86
0:04:41.425,000 --> 0:04:44,000
in a way that no one else ever had.

87
0:04:45.104,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us

88
0:04:49.429,000 --> 0:04:51,000
by confessing his secret,

89
0:04:51.949,000 --> 0:04:55,000
which was that, as a very young boy starting at age four,

90
0:04:56.429,000 --> 0:04:58,000
he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused

91
0:04:59.34,000 --> 0:05:,000
by his stepfather,

92
0:05:01.026,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade,

93
0:05:04.966,000 --> 0:05:06,000
even though he was very smart,

94
0:05:07.585,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and he'd spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life.

95
0:05:10.841,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Which is why that Ivy League degree

96
0:05:13.997,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future

97
0:05:16.81,000 --> 0:05:18,000
meant so much to him.

98
0:05:19.381,000 --> 0:05:21,000
If you had told me

99
0:05:21.525,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that this smart, funny, sensitive man who adored me

100
0:05:26.889,000 --> 0:05:3,000
would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup,

101
0:05:31.272,000 --> 0:05:33,000
how short my skirts were,

102
0:05:33.322,000 --> 0:05:34,000
where I lived, what jobs I took,

103
0:05:35.252,000 --> 0:05:38,000
who my friends were and where I spent Christmas,

104
0:05:38.616,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I would have laughed at you,

105
0:05:40.564,000 --> 0:05:43,000
because there was not a hint of violence or control

106
0:05:43.612,000 --> 0:05:46,000
or anger in Conor at the beginning.

107
0:05:47.096,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I didn't know that the first stage

108
0:05:50.221,000 --> 0:05:52,000
in any domestic violence relationship

109
0:05:52.596,000 --> 0:05:55,000
is to seduce and charm the victim.

110
0:05:56.248,000 --> 0:06:,000
I also didn't know that the second step is to isolate the victim.

111
0:06:01.008,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Now, Conor did not come home one day and announce,

112
0:06:05.162,000 --> 0:06:08,000
"You know, hey, all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great,

113
0:06:08.296,000 --> 0:06:1,000
but I need to move into the next phase

114
0:06:10.301,000 --> 0:06:14,000
where I isolate you and I abuse you" — (Laughter) —

115
0:06:14.48,000 --> 0:06:15,000
"so I need to get you out of this apartment

116
0:06:15.835,000 --> 0:06:16,000
where the neighbors can hear you scream

117
0:06:17.476,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and out of this city where you have friends and family

118
0:06:19.949,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and coworkers who can see the bruises."

119
0:06:23.255,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Instead, Conor came home one Friday evening

120
0:06:27.476,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and he told me that he had quit his job that day,

121
0:06:30.207,000 --> 0:06:32,000
his dream job,

122
0:06:32.672,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and he said that he had quit his job because of me,

123
0:06:36.813,000 --> 0:06:39,000
because I had made him feel so safe and loved

124
0:06:39.991,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that he didn't need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore,

125
0:06:43.114,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and he just wanted to get out of the city

126
0:06:45.629,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and away from his abusive, dysfunctional family,

127
0:06:48.607,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and move to a tiny town in New England

128
0:06:51.729,000 --> 0:06:54,000
where he could start his life over with me by his side.

129
0:06:55.302,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York,

130
0:06:59.168,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and my dream job,

131
0:07:02.775,000 --> 0:07:04,000
but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate,

132
0:07:05.358,000 --> 0:07:08,000
so I agreed, and I quit my job,

133
0:07:08.822,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and Conor and I left Manhattan together.

134
0:07:11.453,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I had no idea I was falling into crazy love,

135
0:07:15.819,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid

136
0:07:19.451,000 --> 0:07:23,000
physical, financial and psychological trap.

137
0:07:24.431,000 --> 0:07:26,000
The next step in the domestic violence pattern

138
0:07:26.751,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is to introduce the threat of violence

139
0:07:31.033,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and see how she reacts.

140
0:07:33.232,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And here's where those guns come in.

141
0:07:35.941,000 --> 0:07:37,000
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know,

142
0:07:38.859,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe --

143
0:07:41.597,000 --> 0:07:43,000
he bought three guns.

144
0:07:44.013,000 --> 0:07:47,000
He kept one in the glove compartment of our car.

145
0:07:47.453,000 --> 0:07:49,000
He kept one under the pillows on our bed,

146
0:07:50.109,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times.

147
0:07:53.271,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And he said that he needed those guns

148
0:07:55.589,000 --> 0:07:57,000
because of the trauma he'd experienced as a young boy.

149
0:07:58.385,000 --> 0:08:,000
He needed them to feel protected.

150
0:08:00.869,000 --> 0:08:02,000
But those guns were really a message for me,

151
0:08:03.781,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and even though he hadn't raised a hand to me,

152
0:08:06.475,000 --> 0:08:11,000
my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day.

153
0:08:12.281,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Conor first physically attacked me

154
0:08:15.854,000 --> 0:08:17,000
five days before our wedding.

155
0:08:18.679,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown.

156
0:08:22.871,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment,

157
0:08:27.111,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and I got frustrated,

158
0:08:28.925,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and Conor used my anger as an excuse

159
0:08:32.012,000 --> 0:08:35,000
to put both of his hands around my neck

160
0:08:35.163,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream,

161
0:08:38.983,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and he used the chokehold

162
0:08:40.807,000 --> 0:08:44,000
to hit my head repeatedly against the wall.

163
0:08:45.233,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Five days later, the ten bruises on my neck had just faded,

164
0:08:50.551,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and I put on my mother's wedding dress,

165
0:08:53.026,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and I married him.

166
0:08:55.343,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Despite what had happened,

167
0:08:57.624,000 --> 0:09:,000
I was sure we were going to live happily ever after,

168
0:09:01.143,000 --> 0:09:05,000
because I loved him, and he loved me so much.

169
0:09:05.224,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And he was very, very sorry.

170
0:09:08.596,000 --> 0:09:11,000
He had just been really stressed out by the wedding

171
0:09:11.769,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and by becoming a family with me.

172
0:09:13.966,000 --> 0:09:14,000
It was an isolated incident,

173
0:09:15.687,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and he was never going to hurt me again.

174
0:09:19.283,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It happened twice more on the honeymoon.

175
0:09:21.863,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The first time, I was driving to find a secret beach

176
0:09:24.95,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and I got lost,

177
0:09:27.652,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and he punched me in the side of my head so hard

178
0:09:30.622,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that the other side of my head repeatedly hit

179
0:09:32.766,000 --> 0:09:34,000
the driver's side window.

180
0:09:35.173,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And then a few days later, driving home from our honeymoon,

181
0:09:38.539,000 --> 0:09:4,000
he got frustrated by traffic,

182
0:09:40.822,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face.

183
0:09:44.254,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week

184
0:09:46.862,000 --> 0:09:49,000
for the next two and a half years of our marriage.

185
0:09:50.279,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique

186
0:09:53.404,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and alone in this situation.

187
0:09:56.047,000 --> 0:09:58,000
One in three American women

188
0:09:58.238,000 --> 0:10:02,000
experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life,

189
0:10:02.39,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and the CDC reports that 15 million children

190
0:10:06.031,000 --> 0:10:09,000
are abused every year, 15 million.

191
0:10:09.441,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So actually, I was in very good company.

192
0:10:13.814,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Back to my question:

193
0:10:16.23,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Why did I stay?

194
0:10:18.725,000 --> 0:10:2,000
The answer is easy.

195
0:10:21.463,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I didn't know he was abusing me.

196
0:10:24.151,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Even though he held those loaded guns to my head,

197
0:10:27.999,000 --> 0:10:29,000
pushed me down stairs,

198
0:10:30.222,000 --> 0:10:31,000
threatened to kill our dog,

199
0:10:31.603,000 --> 0:10:34,000
pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway,

200
0:10:35.526,000 --> 0:10:37,000
poured coffee grinds on my head

201
0:10:38.043,000 --> 0:10:4,000
as I dressed for a job interview,

202
0:10:40.359,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I never once thought of myself as a battered wife.

203
0:10:44.729,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Instead, I was a very strong woman

204
0:10:48.306,000 --> 0:10:5,000
in love with a deeply troubled man,

205
0:10:50.558,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and I was the only person on Earth

206
0:10:52.615,000 --> 0:10:55,000
who could help Conor face his demons.

207
0:10:56.055,000 --> 0:10:59,000
The other question everybody asks is,

208
0:10:59.766,000 --> 0:11:01,000
why doesn't she just leave?

209
0:11:02.183,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Why didn't I walk out? I could have left any time.

210
0:11:06.134,000 --> 0:11:1,000
To me, this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask,

211
0:11:10.846,000 --> 0:11:13,000
because we victims know something you usually don't:

212
0:11:13.937,000 --> 0:11:17,000
It's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser.

213
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern

214
0:11:21.649,000 --> 0:11:23,000
is kill her.

215
0:11:24.544,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Over 70 percent of domestic violence murders

216
0:11:27.085,000 --> 0:11:31,000
happen after the victim has ended the relationship,

217
0:11:31.153,000 --> 0:11:32,000
after she's gotten out,

218
0:11:33.046,000 --> 0:11:36,000
because then the abuser has nothing left to lose.

219
0:11:36.297,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Other outcomes include long-term stalking,

220
0:11:39.388,000 --> 0:11:41,000
even after the abuser remarries;

221
0:11:42.34,000 --> 0:11:44,000
denial of financial resources;

222
0:11:44.495,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and manipulation of the family court system

223
0:11:46.884,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to terrify the victim and her children,

224
0:11:49.707,000 --> 0:11:53,000
who are regularly forced by family court judges

225
0:11:54.633,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to spend unsupervised time

226
0:11:56.602,000 --> 0:11:59,000
with the man who beat their mother.

227
0:12:00.273,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And still we ask, why doesn't she just leave?

228
0:12:04.448,000 --> 0:12:05,000
I was able to leave,

229
0:12:06.202,000 --> 0:12:08,000
because of one final, sadistic beating

230
0:12:09.104,000 --> 0:12:12,000
that broke through my denial.

231
0:12:12.263,000 --> 0:12:15,000
I realized that the man who I loved so much

232
0:12:15.433,000 --> 0:12:17,000
was going to kill me if I let him.

233
0:12:18.343,000 --> 0:12:2,000
So I broke the silence.

234
0:12:20.858,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I told everyone:

235
0:12:23.688,000 --> 0:12:26,000
the police, my neighbors,

236
0:12:27.473,000 --> 0:12:3,000
my friends and family, total strangers,

237
0:12:31.313,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and I'm here today because you all helped me.

238
0:12:38.167,000 --> 0:12:4,000
We tend to stereotype victims

239
0:12:40.705,000 --> 0:12:43,000
as grisly headlines,

240
0:12:43.767,000 --> 0:12:46,000
self-destructive women, damaged goods.

241
0:12:47.063,000 --> 0:12:5,000
The question, "Why does she stay?"

242
0:12:50.066,000 --> 0:12:55,000
is code for some people for, "It's her fault for staying,"

243
0:12:55.702,000 --> 0:12:58,000
as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men

244
0:12:59.026,000 --> 0:13:01,000
intent upon destroying us.

245
0:13:01.658,000 --> 0:13:03,000
But since publishing "Crazy Love,"

246
0:13:04.162,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women

247
0:13:07.685,000 --> 0:13:09,000
who also got out,

248
0:13:10.13,000 --> 0:13:14,000
who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened,

249
0:13:14.51,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and who rebuilt lives -- joyous, happy lives --

250
0:13:18.723,000 --> 0:13:2,000
as employees, wives and mothers,

251
0:13:21.057,000 --> 0:13:25,000
lives completely free of violence, like me.

252
0:13:25.738,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Because it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim

253
0:13:29.769,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and a typical domestic violence survivor.

254
0:13:33.213,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I remarried a kind and gentle man,

255
0:13:37.238,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and we have those three kids.

256
0:13:39.574,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I have that black lab, and I have that minivan.

257
0:13:42.975,000 --> 0:13:45,000
What I will never have again,

258
0:13:46.441,000 --> 0:13:48,000
ever,

259
0:13:49.399,000 --> 0:13:51,000
is a loaded gun held to my head

260
0:13:51.524,000 --> 0:13:54,000
by someone who says that he loves me.

261
0:13:55.167,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Right now, maybe you're thinking,

262
0:13:57.798,000 --> 0:13:58,000
"Wow, this is fascinating,"

263
0:13:59.705,000 --> 0:14:02,000
or, "Wow, how stupid was she,"

264
0:14:02.833,000 --> 0:14:08,000
but this whole time, I've actually been talking about you.

265
0:14:08.836,000 --> 0:14:11,000
I promise you there are several people

266
0:14:12.353,000 --> 0:14:13,000
listening to me right now

267
0:14:14.095,000 --> 0:14:17,000
who are currently being abused

268
0:14:17.107,000 --> 0:14:19,000
or who were abused as children

269
0:14:19.622,000 --> 0:14:22,000
or who are abusers themselves.

270
0:14:22.992,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Abuse could be affecting your daughter,

271
0:14:24.929,000 --> 0:14:29,000
your sister, your best friend right now.

272
0:14:30.222,000 --> 0:14:33,000
I was able to end my own crazy love story

273
0:14:33.666,000 --> 0:14:35,000
by breaking the silence.

274
0:14:35.867,000 --> 0:14:37,000
I'm still breaking the silence today.

275
0:14:38.382,000 --> 0:14:41,000
It's my way of helping other victims,

276
0:14:42.198,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and it's my final request of you.

277
0:14:45.566,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Talk about what you heard here.

278
0:14:48.398,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Abuse thrives only in silence.

279
0:14:51.726,000 --> 0:14:54,000
You have the power to end domestic violence

280
0:14:55.429,000 --> 0:14:58,000
simply by shining a spotlight on it.

281
0:14:58.938,000 --> 0:15:01,000
We victims need everyone.

282
0:15:02.012,000 --> 0:15:06,000
We need every one of you to understand

283
0:15:06.085,000 --> 0:15:09,000
the secrets of domestic violence.

284
0:15:09.863,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Show abuse the light of day by talking about it

285
0:15:12.847,000 --> 0:15:14,000
with your children, your coworkers,

286
0:15:14.974,000 --> 0:15:15,000
your friends and family.

287
0:15:16.911,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Recast survivors as wonderful, lovable people

288
0:15:20.357,000 --> 0:15:22,000
with full futures.

289
0:15:23.172,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Recognize the early signs of violence

290
0:15:26.653,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and conscientiously intervene,

291
0:15:29.486,000 --> 0:15:33,000
deescalate it, show victims a safe way out.

292
0:15:33.648,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Together we can make our beds,

293
0:15:37.643,000 --> 0:15:4,000
our dinner tables and our families

294
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
the safe and peaceful oases they should be.

295
0:15:44.517,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Thank you.

296
0:15:46.489,000 --> 0:15:53,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.612,000 --> 0:00:14,000
For the next 16 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey

2
0:00:15.398,000 --> 0:00:18,000
that is probably the biggest dream of humanity:

3
0:00:18.508,000 --> 0:00:2,000
to understand the code of life.

4
0:00:21.072,000 --> 0:00:23,000
So for me, everything started many, many years ago

5
0:00:23.839,000 --> 0:00:25,000
when I met the first 3D printer.

6
0:00:26.586,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The concept was fascinating.

7
0:00:28.284,000 --> 0:00:3,000
A 3D printer needs three elements:

8
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
a bit of information, some raw material, some energy,

9
0:00:34.488,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and it can produce any object that was not there before.

10
0:00:38.517,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I was doing physics, I was coming back home

11
0:00:40.678,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and I realized that I actually always knew a 3D printer.

12
0:00:44.14,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And everyone does.

13
0:00:45.5,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It was my mom.

14
0:00:46.682,000 --> 0:00:47,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:47.707,000 --> 0:00:49,000
My mom takes three elements:

16
0:00:50.145,000 --> 0:00:53,000
a bit of information, which is between my father and my mom in this case,

17
0:00:54.142,000 --> 0:00:58,000
raw elements and energy in the same media, that is food,

18
0:00:58.323,000 --> 0:01:,000
and after several months, produces me.

19
0:01:00.855,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And I was not existent before.

20
0:01:02.691,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So apart from the shock of my mom discovering that she was a 3D printer,

21
0:01:06.477,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I immediately got mesmerized by that piece,

22
0:01:11.239,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the first one, the information.

23
0:01:12.98,000 --> 0:01:14,000
What amount of information does it take

24
0:01:15.255,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to build and assemble a human?

25
0:01:17.215,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Is it much? Is it little?

26
0:01:18.813,000 --> 0:01:2,000
How many thumb drives can you fill?

27
0:01:21.017,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Well, I was studying physics at the beginning

28
0:01:23.665,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and I took this approximation of a human as a gigantic Lego piece.

29
0:01:29.286,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So, imagine that the building blocks are little atoms

30
0:01:33.095,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and there is a hydrogen here, a carbon here, a nitrogen here.

31
0:01:37.772,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So in the first approximation,

32
0:01:39.367,000 --> 0:01:43,000
if I can list the number of atoms that compose a human being,

33
0:01:43.734,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I can build it.

34
0:01:45.145,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Now, you can run some numbers

35
0:01:47.198,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and that happens to be quite an astonishing number.

36
0:01:50.499,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So the number of atoms,

37
0:01:53.28,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the file that I will save in my thumb drive to assemble a little baby,

38
0:01:58.059,000 --> 0:02:02,000
will actually fill an entire Titanic of thumb drives --

39
0:02:02.75,000 --> 0:02:04,000
multiplied 2,000 times.

40
0:02:05.957,000 --> 0:02:08,000
This is the miracle of life.

41
0:02:09.382,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Every time you see from now on a pregnant lady,

42
0:02:12.018,000 --> 0:02:14,000
she's assembling the biggest amount of information

43
0:02:14.898,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that you will ever encounter.

44
0:02:16.478,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Forget big data, forget anything you heard of.

45
0:02:19.452,000 --> 0:02:21,000
This is the biggest amount of information that exists.

46
0:02:22.357,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Applause)

47
0:02:26.214,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But nature, fortunately, is much smarter than a young physicist,

48
0:02:30.882,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and in four billion years, managed to pack this information

49
0:02:34.482,000 --> 0:02:36,000
in a small crystal we call DNA.

50
0:02:37.605,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We met it for the first time in 1950 when Rosalind Franklin,

51
0:02:41.941,000 --> 0:02:42,000
an amazing scientist, a woman,

52
0:02:43.521,000 --> 0:02:44,000
took a picture of it.

53
0:02:44.934,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But it took us more than 40 years to finally poke inside a human cell,

54
0:02:50.146,000 --> 0:02:51,000
take out this crystal,

55
0:02:51.772,000 --> 0:02:54,000
unroll it, and read it for the first time.

56
0:02:55.615,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The code comes out to be a fairly simple alphabet,

57
0:02:58.88,000 --> 0:03:01,000
four letters: A, T, C and G.

58
0:03:02.676,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And to build a human, you need three billion of them.

59
0:03:06.933,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Three billion.

60
0:03:08.136,000 --> 0:03:09,000
How many are three billion?

61
0:03:09.739,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It doesn't really make any sense as a number, right?

62
0:03:12.525,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So I was thinking how I could explain myself better

63
0:03:16.634,000 --> 0:03:19,000
about how big and enormous this code is.

64
0:03:19.708,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But there is -- I mean, I'm going to have some help,

65
0:03:22.786,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and the best person to help me introduce the code

66
0:03:26.037,000 --> 0:03:29,000
is actually the first man to sequence it, Dr. Craig Venter.

67
0:03:29.583,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So welcome onstage, Dr. Craig Venter.

68
0:03:32.997,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Applause)

69
0:03:39.952,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Not the man in the flesh,

70
0:03:43.448,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but for the first time in history,

71
0:03:45.817,000 --> 0:03:48,000
this is the genome of a specific human,

72
0:03:49.303,000 --> 0:03:52,000
printed page-by-page, letter-by-letter:

73
0:03:53.087,000 --> 0:03:56,000
262,000 pages of information,

74
0:03:57.107,000 --> 0:04:01,000
450 kilograms, shipped from the United States to Canada

75
0:04:01.495,000 --> 0:04:05,000
thanks to Bruno Bowden, Lulu.com, a start-up, did everything.

76
0:04:06.362,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It was an amazing feat.

77
0:04:07.849,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But this is the visual perception of what is the code of life.

78
0:04:12.17,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And now, for the first time, I can do something fun.

79
0:04:14.672,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I can actually poke inside it and read.

80
0:04:17.243,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So let me take an interesting book ... like this one.

81
0:04:25.077,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I have an annotation; it's a fairly big book.

82
0:04:27.635,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So just to let you see what is the code of life.

83
0:04:32.566,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Thousands and thousands and thousands

84
0:04:35.981,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and millions of letters.

85
0:04:38.675,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And they apparently make sense.

86
0:04:41.095,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Let's get to a specific part.

87
0:04:43.571,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Let me read it to you:

88
0:04:44.957,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:46.002,000 --> 0:04:5,000
"AAG, AAT, ATA."

90
0:04:50.965,000 --> 0:04:52,000
To you it sounds like mute letters,

91
0:04:53.056,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but this sequence gives the color of the eyes to Craig.

92
0:04:57.633,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I'll show you another part of the book.

93
0:04:59.589,000 --> 0:05:01,000
This is actually a little more complicated.

94
0:05:02.983,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Chromosome 14, book 132:

95
0:05:05.654,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Laughter)

96
0:05:07.768,000 --> 0:05:08,000
As you might expect.

97
0:05:09.069,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:14.857,000 --> 0:05:18,000
"ATT, CTT, GATT."

99
0:05:20.329,000 --> 0:05:21,000
This human is lucky,

100
0:05:22.04,000 --> 0:05:26,000
because if you miss just two letters in this position --

101
0:05:26.581,000 --> 0:05:27,000
two letters of our three billion --

102
0:05:28.482,000 --> 0:05:3,000
he will be condemned to a terrible disease:

103
0:05:30.525,000 --> 0:05:31,000
cystic fibrosis.

104
0:05:31.989,000 --> 0:05:34,000
We have no cure for it, we don't know how to solve it,

105
0:05:35.426,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and it's just two letters of difference from what we are.

106
0:05:39.585,000 --> 0:05:41,000
A wonderful book, a mighty book,

107
0:05:43.115,000 --> 0:05:44,000
a mighty book that helped me understand

108
0:05:45.137,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and show you something quite remarkable.

109
0:05:48.48,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Every one of you -- what makes me, me and you, you --

110
0:05:52.939,000 --> 0:05:54,000
is just about five million of these,

111
0:05:55.917,000 --> 0:05:56,000
half a book.

112
0:05:58.015,000 --> 0:05:59,000
For the rest,

113
0:05:59.702,000 --> 0:06:01,000
we are all absolutely identical.

114
0:06:03.008,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Five hundred pages is the miracle of life that you are.

115
0:06:07.05,000 --> 0:06:09,000
The rest, we all share it.

116
0:06:09.605,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So think about that again when we think that we are different.

117
0:06:12.538,000 --> 0:06:14,000
This is the amount that we share.

118
0:06:15.441,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So now that I have your attention,

119
0:06:18.894,000 --> 0:06:19,000
the next question is:

120
0:06:20.277,000 --> 0:06:21,000
How do I read it?

121
0:06:21.452,000 --> 0:06:22,000
How do I make sense out of it?

122
0:06:23.409,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Well, for however good you can be at assembling Swedish furniture,

123
0:06:27.673,000 --> 0:06:3,000
this instruction manual is nothing you can crack in your life.

124
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Laughter)

125
0:06:32.887,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And so, in 2014, two famous TEDsters,

126
0:06:36.023,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Peter Diamandis and Craig Venter himself,

127
0:06:38.587,000 --> 0:06:39,000
decided to assemble a new company.

128
0:06:40.538,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Human Longevity was born,

129
0:06:41.974,000 --> 0:06:42,000
with one mission:

130
0:06:43.368,000 --> 0:06:44,000
trying everything we can try

131
0:06:45.253,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and learning everything we can learn from these books,

132
0:06:48.036,000 --> 0:06:49,000
with one target --

133
0:06:50.862,000 --> 0:06:52,000
making real the dream of personalized medicine,

134
0:06:53.687,000 --> 0:06:56,000
understanding what things should be done to have better health

135
0:06:57.478,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and what are the secrets in these books.

136
0:07:00.329,000 --> 0:07:04,000
An amazing team, 40 data scientists and many, many more people,

137
0:07:04.603,000 --> 0:07:05,000
a pleasure to work with.

138
0:07:05.977,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The concept is actually very simple.

139
0:07:08.254,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We're going to use a technology called machine learning.

140
0:07:11.436,000 --> 0:07:15,000
On one side, we have genomes -- thousands of them.

141
0:07:15.999,000 --> 0:07:18,000
On the other side, we collected the biggest database of human beings:

142
0:07:20.02,000 --> 0:07:24,000
phenotypes, 3D scan, NMR -- everything you can think of.

143
0:07:24.34,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Inside there, on these two opposite sides,

144
0:07:27.263,000 --> 0:07:29,000
there is the secret of translation.

145
0:07:29.729,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And in the middle, we build a machine.

146
0:07:32.801,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We build a machine and we train a machine --

147
0:07:35.21,000 --> 0:07:38,000
well, not exactly one machine, many, many machines --

148
0:07:38.444,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to try to understand and translate the genome in a phenotype.

149
0:07:43.362,000 --> 0:07:46,000
What are those letters, and what do they do?

150
0:07:46.726,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It's an approach that can be used for everything,

151
0:07:49.497,000 --> 0:07:51,000
but using it in genomics is particularly complicated.

152
0:07:52.514,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Little by little we grew and we wanted to build different challenges.

153
0:07:55.814,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We started from the beginning, from common traits.

154
0:07:58.57,000 --> 0:08:,000
Common traits are comfortable because they are common,

155
0:08:01.197,000 --> 0:08:02,000
everyone has them.

156
0:08:02.405,000 --> 0:08:04,000
So we started to ask our questions:

157
0:08:04.923,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Can we predict height?

158
0:08:06.985,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Can we read the books and predict your height?

159
0:08:09.186,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Well, we actually can,

160
0:08:10.361,000 --> 0:08:11,000
with five centimeters of precision.

161
0:08:12.178,000 --> 0:08:15,000
BMI is fairly connected to your lifestyle,

162
0:08:15.337,000 --> 0:08:18,000
but we still can, we get in the ballpark, eight kilograms of precision.

163
0:08:19.225,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Can we predict eye color?

164
0:08:20.48,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Yeah, we can.

165
0:08:21.662,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Eighty percent accuracy.

166
0:08:23.466,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Can we predict skin color?

167
0:08:25.348,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Yeah we can, 80 percent accuracy.

168
0:08:27.813,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Can we predict age?

169
0:08:30.121,000 --> 0:08:33,000
We can, because apparently, the code changes during your life.

170
0:08:33.884,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It gets shorter, you lose pieces, it gets insertions.

171
0:08:37.19,000 --> 0:08:39,000
We read the signals, and we make a model.

172
0:08:40.438,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Now, an interesting challenge:

173
0:08:41.937,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Can we predict a human face?

174
0:08:45.014,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It's a little complicated,

175
0:08:46.316,000 --> 0:08:49,000
because a human face is scattered among millions of these letters.

176
0:08:49.531,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And a human face is not a very well-defined object.

177
0:08:52.184,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So, we had to build an entire tier of it

178
0:08:54.259,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to learn and teach a machine what a face is,

179
0:08:56.993,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and embed and compress it.

180
0:08:59.054,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And if you're comfortable with machine learning,

181
0:09:01.326,000 --> 0:09:03,000
you understand what the challenge is here.

182
0:09:04.108,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Now, after 15 years -- 15 years after we read the first sequence --

183
0:09:10.123,000 --> 0:09:12,000
this October, we started to see some signals.

184
0:09:13.049,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And it was a very emotional moment.

185
0:09:15.528,000 --> 0:09:18,000
What you see here is a subject coming in our lab.

186
0:09:19.619,000 --> 0:09:2,000
This is a face for us.

187
0:09:21.571,000 --> 0:09:24,000
So we take the real face of a subject, we reduce the complexity,

188
0:09:25.226,000 --> 0:09:26,000
because not everything is in your face --

189
0:09:27.22,000 --> 0:09:3,000
lots of features and defects and asymmetries come from your life.

190
0:09:31.03,000 --> 0:09:34,000
We symmetrize the face, and we run our algorithm.

191
0:09:35.245,000 --> 0:09:36,000
The results that I show you right now,

192
0:09:37.167,000 --> 0:09:4,000
this is the prediction we have from the blood.

193
0:09:41.596,000 --> 0:09:42,000
(Applause)

194
0:09:43.144,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Wait a second.

195
0:09:44.603,000 --> 0:09:48,000
In these seconds, your eyes are watching, left and right, left and right,

196
0:09:49.319,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and your brain wants those pictures to be identical.

197
0:09:53.273,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So I ask you to do another exercise, to be honest.

198
0:09:55.743,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Please search for the differences,

199
0:09:58.054,000 --> 0:09:59,000
which are many.

200
0:09:59.439,000 --> 0:10:01,000
The biggest amount of signal comes from gender,

201
0:10:02.066,000 --> 0:10:07,000
then there is age, BMI, the ethnicity component of a human.

202
0:10:07.291,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And scaling up over that signal is much more complicated.

203
0:10:11.026,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But what you see here, even in the differences,

204
0:10:14.3,000 --> 0:10:17,000
lets you understand that we are in the right ballpark,

205
0:10:17.919,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that we are getting closer.

206
0:10:19.291,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And it's already giving you some emotions.

207
0:10:21.664,000 --> 0:10:23,000
This is another subject that comes in place,

208
0:10:24.391,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and this is a prediction.

209
0:10:25.824,000 --> 0:10:29,000
A little smaller face, we didn't get the complete cranial structure,

210
0:10:30.444,000 --> 0:10:32,000
but still, it's in the ballpark.

211
0:10:33.634,000 --> 0:10:35,000
This is a subject that comes in our lab,

212
0:10:35.882,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and this is the prediction.

213
0:10:38.056,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So these people have never been seen in the training of the machine.

214
0:10:42.756,000 --> 0:10:44,000
These are the so-called "held-out" set.

215
0:10:45.617,000 --> 0:10:48,000
But these are people that you will probably never believe.

216
0:10:49.381,000 --> 0:10:51,000
We're publishing everything in a scientific publication,

217
0:10:52.081,000 --> 0:10:53,000
you can read it.

218
0:10:53.256,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But since we are onstage, Chris challenged me.

219
0:10:55.624,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I probably exposed myself and tried to predict

220
0:10:59.274,000 --> 0:11:01,000
someone that you might recognize.

221
0:11:02.47,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So, in this vial of blood -- and believe me, you have no idea

222
0:11:06.919,000 --> 0:11:08,000
what we had to do to have this blood now, here --

223
0:11:09.823,000 --> 0:11:12,000
in this vial of blood is the amount of biological information

224
0:11:13.748,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that we need to do a full genome sequence.

225
0:11:16.049,000 --> 0:11:18,000
We just need this amount.

226
0:11:18.528,000 --> 0:11:21,000
We ran this sequence, and I'm going to do it with you.

227
0:11:21.757,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And we start to layer up all the understanding we have.

228
0:11:25.76,000 --> 0:11:28,000
In the vial of blood, we predicted he's a male.

229
0:11:29.134,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And the subject is a male.

230
0:11:30.996,000 --> 0:11:32,000
We predict that he's a meter and 76 cm.

231
0:11:33.458,000 --> 0:11:35,000
The subject is a meter and 77 cm.

232
0:11:35.874,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So, we predicted that he's 76; the subject is 82.

233
0:11:40.701,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We predict his age, 38.

234
0:11:43.357,000 --> 0:11:44,000
The subject is 35.

235
0:11:45.851,000 --> 0:11:47,000
We predict his eye color.

236
0:11:48.824,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Too dark.

237
0:11:50.059,000 --> 0:11:51,000
We predict his skin color.

238
0:11:52.026,000 --> 0:11:53,000
We are almost there.

239
0:11:53.899,000 --> 0:11:54,000
That's his face.

240
0:11:57.172,000 --> 0:12:,000
Now, the reveal moment:

241
0:12:00.465,000 --> 0:12:01,000
the subject is this person.

242
0:12:02.259,000 --> 0:12:03,000
(Laughter)

243
0:12:04.218,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And I did it intentionally.

244
0:12:06.3,000 --> 0:12:09,000
I am a very particular and peculiar ethnicity.

245
0:12:10.016,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Southern European, Italians -- they never fit in models.

246
0:12:12.99,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And it's particular -- that ethnicity is a complex corner case for our model.

247
0:12:18.144,000 --> 0:12:19,000
But there is another point.

248
0:12:19.677,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So, one of the things that we use a lot to recognize people

249
0:12:23.178,000 --> 0:12:24,000
will never be written in the genome.

250
0:12:24.924,000 --> 0:12:26,000
It's our free will, it's how I look.

251
0:12:27.265,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Not my haircut in this case, but my beard cut.

252
0:12:30.518,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So I'm going to show you, I'm going to, in this case, transfer it --

253
0:12:34.095,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and this is nothing more than Photoshop, no modeling --

254
0:12:36.884,000 --> 0:12:37,000
the beard on the subject.

255
0:12:38.621,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And immediately, we get much, much better in the feeling.

256
0:12:42.955,000 --> 0:12:44,000
So, why do we do this?

257
0:12:47.938,000 --> 0:12:52,000
We certainly don't do it for predicting height

258
0:12:53.102,000 --> 0:12:55,000
or taking a beautiful picture out of your blood.

259
0:12:56.39,000 --> 0:13:,000
We do it because the same technology and the same approach,

260
0:13:00.432,000 --> 0:13:02,000
the machine learning of this code,

261
0:13:02.976,000 --> 0:13:05,000
is helping us to understand how we work,

262
0:13:06.137,000 --> 0:13:07,000
how your body works,

263
0:13:07.647,000 --> 0:13:08,000
how your body ages,

264
0:13:09.336,000 --> 0:13:11,000
how disease generates in your body,

265
0:13:12.129,000 --> 0:13:14,000
how your cancer grows and develops,

266
0:13:15.125,000 --> 0:13:16,000
how drugs work

267
0:13:16.932,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and if they work on your body.

268
0:13:19.713,000 --> 0:13:2,000
This is a huge challenge.

269
0:13:21.894,000 --> 0:13:22,000
This is a challenge that we share

270
0:13:23.556,000 --> 0:13:25,000
with thousands of other researchers around the world.

271
0:13:26.159,000 --> 0:13:28,000
It's called personalized medicine.

272
0:13:29.125,000 --> 0:13:32,000
It's the ability to move from a statistical approach

273
0:13:32.609,000 --> 0:13:34,000
where you're a dot in the ocean,

274
0:13:34.665,000 --> 0:13:35,000
to a personalized approach,

275
0:13:36.502,000 --> 0:13:38,000
where we read all these books

276
0:13:38.711,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and we get an understanding of exactly how you are.

277
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
But it is a particularly complicated challenge,

278
0:13:45.646,000 --> 0:13:48,000
because of all these books, as of today,

279
0:13:49.668,000 --> 0:13:51,000
we just know probably two percent:

280
0:13:53.027,000 --> 0:13:56,000
four books of more than 175.

281
0:13:58.021,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And this is not the topic of my talk,

282
0:14:02.145,000 --> 0:14:04,000
because we will learn more.

283
0:14:05.378,000 --> 0:14:07,000
There are the best minds in the world on this topic.

284
0:14:09.048,000 --> 0:14:1,000
The prediction will get better,

285
0:14:10.906,000 --> 0:14:12,000
the model will get more precise.

286
0:14:13.183,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And the more we learn,

287
0:14:15.065,000 --> 0:14:19,000
the more we will be confronted with decisions

288
0:14:19.919,000 --> 0:14:22,000
that we never had to face before

289
0:14:22.964,000 --> 0:14:23,000
about life,

290
0:14:24.423,000 --> 0:14:25,000
about death,

291
0:14:26.121,000 --> 0:14:27,000
about parenting.

292
0:14:32.626,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So, we are touching the very inner detail on how life works.

293
0:14:38.118,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And it's a revolution that cannot be confined

294
0:14:41.3,000 --> 0:14:43,000
in the domain of science or technology.

295
0:14:44.96,000 --> 0:14:46,000
This must be a global conversation.

296
0:14:47.798,000 --> 0:14:52,000
We must start to think of the future we're building as a humanity.

297
0:14:53.039,000 --> 0:14:57,000
We need to interact with creatives, with artists, with philosophers,

298
0:14:57.127,000 --> 0:14:58,000
with politicians.

299
0:14:58.661,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Everyone is involved,

300
0:14:59.843,000 --> 0:15:01,000
because it's the future of our species.

301
0:15:03.273,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Without fear, but with the understanding

302
0:15:07.265,000 --> 0:15:1,000
that the decisions that we make in the next year

303
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
will change the course of history forever.

304
0:15:15.732,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Thank you.

305
0:15:16.916,000 --> 0:15:26,000
(Applause)

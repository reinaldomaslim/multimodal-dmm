1
0:00:12.952,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I want to start by doing an experiment.

2
0:00:16.857,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm going to play three videos of a rainy day.

3
0:00:20.935,000 --> 0:00:23,000
But I've replaced the audio of one of the videos,

4
0:00:24.843,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and instead of the sound of rain,

5
0:00:27.241,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I've added the sound of bacon frying.

6
0:00:31.137,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So I want you think carefully which one the clip with the bacon is.

7
0:00:35.695,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Rain falls)

8
0:00:39.394,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Rain falls)

9
0:00:43.627,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Rain falls)

10
0:00:52.611,000 --> 0:00:53,000
All right.

11
0:00:55.064,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Actually, I lied.

12
0:00:57.662,000 --> 0:00:58,000
They're all bacon.

13
0:00:58.956,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Bacon sizzles)

14
0:01:04.276,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Applause)

15
0:01:09.216,000 --> 0:01:12,000
My point here isn't really to make you hungry

16
0:01:12.513,000 --> 0:01:13,000
every time you see a rainy scene,

17
0:01:14.186,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but it's to show that our brains are conditioned to embrace the lies.

18
0:01:20.696,000 --> 0:01:22,000
We're not looking for accuracy.

19
0:01:23.754,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So on the subject of deception,

20
0:01:26.563,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I wanted to quote one of my favorite authors.

21
0:01:29.95,000 --> 0:01:35,000
In "The Decay of Lying," Oscar Wilde establishes the idea

22
0:01:36.923,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that all bad art comes from copying nature and being realistic;

23
0:01:43.096,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and all great art comes from lying and deceiving,

24
0:01:49.03,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and telling beautiful, untrue things.

25
0:01:52.087,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So when you're watching a movie

26
0:01:56.89,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and a phone rings,

27
0:01:58.426,000 --> 0:02:,000
it's not actually ringing.

28
0:02:00.942,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It's been added later in postproduction in a studio.

29
0:02:05.22,000 --> 0:02:07,000
All of the sounds you hear are fake.

30
0:02:08.098,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Everything, apart from the dialogue,

31
0:02:09.932,000 --> 0:02:1,000
is fake.

32
0:02:11.11,000 --> 0:02:14,000
When you watch a movie and you see a bird flapping its wings --

33
0:02:14.794,000 --> 0:02:16,000
(Wings flap)

34
0:02:18.141,000 --> 0:02:2,000
They haven't really recorded the bird.

35
0:02:20.428,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It sounds a lot more realistic if you record a sheet

36
0:02:25.446,000 --> 0:02:26,000
or shaking kitchen gloves.

37
0:02:27.022,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Flaps)

38
0:02:30.849,000 --> 0:02:32,000
The burning of a cigarette up close --

39
0:02:33.816,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Cigarette burns)

40
0:02:37.351,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It actually sounds a lot more authentic

41
0:02:40.126,000 --> 0:02:42,000
if you take a small Saran Wrap ball

42
0:02:42.995,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and release it.

43
0:02:44.237,000 --> 0:02:47,000
(A Saran Warp ball being released)

44
0:02:47.869,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Punches?

45
0:02:49.296,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Punch)

46
0:02:50.842,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Oops, let me play that again.

47
0:02:52.798,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Punch)

48
0:02:54.535,000 --> 0:02:57,000
That's often done by sticking a knife in vegetables,

49
0:02:58.295,000 --> 0:02:59,000
usually cabbage.

50
0:03:00.661,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Cabbage stabbed with a knife)

51
0:03:02.788,000 --> 0:03:04,000
The next one -- it's breaking bones.

52
0:03:05.776,000 --> 0:03:07,000
(Bones break)

53
0:03:08.67,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Well, no one was really harmed.

54
0:03:11.028,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It's actually ...

55
0:03:13.163,000 --> 0:03:16,000
breaking celery or frozen lettuce.

56
0:03:16.442,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Breaking frozen lettuce or celery)

57
0:03:18.947,000 --> 0:03:19,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:21.253,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Making the right sounds is not always as easy

59
0:03:25.992,000 --> 0:03:26,000
as a trip to the supermarket

60
0:03:27.923,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and going to the vegetable section.

61
0:03:30.643,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But it's often a lot more complicated than that.

62
0:03:33.042,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So let's reverse-engineer together

63
0:03:36.089,000 --> 0:03:38,000
the creation of a sound effect.

64
0:03:38.437,000 --> 0:03:41,000
One of my favorite stories comes from Frank Serafine.

65
0:03:41.81,000 --> 0:03:42,000
He's a contributor to our library,

66
0:03:43.685,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and a great sound designer for "Tron" and "Star Trek" and others.

67
0:03:48.291,000 --> 0:03:53,000
He was part of the Paramount team that won the Oscar for best sound

68
0:03:53.573,000 --> 0:03:54,000
for "The Hunt for Red October."

69
0:03:55.528,000 --> 0:03:58,000
In this Cold War classic, in the '90s,

70
0:03:58.942,000 --> 0:04:02,000
they were asked to produce the sound of the propeller of the submarine.

71
0:04:03.751,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So they had a small problem:

72
0:04:05.12,000 --> 0:04:08,000
they couldn't really find a submarine in West Hollywood.

73
0:04:08.664,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So basically, what they did is,

74
0:04:12.346,000 --> 0:04:15,000
they went to a friend's swimming pool,

75
0:04:15.725,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and Frank performed a cannonball, or bomba.

76
0:04:21.069,000 --> 0:04:23,000
They placed an underwater mic

77
0:04:23.289,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and an overhead mic outside the swimming pool.

78
0:04:26.089,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So here's what the underwater mic sounds like.

79
0:04:29.366,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Underwater plunge)

80
0:04:31.608,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Adding the overhead mic,

81
0:04:33.138,000 --> 0:04:34,000
it sounded a bit like this:

82
0:04:35.115,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Water splashes)

83
0:04:37.514,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So now they took the sound and pitched it one octave down,

84
0:04:41.985,000 --> 0:04:43,000
sort of like slowing down a record.

85
0:04:44.85,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Water splashes at lower octave)

86
0:04:47.929,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And then they removed a lot of the high frequencies.

87
0:04:50.721,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Water splashes)

88
0:04:53.02,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And pitched it down another octave.

89
0:04:56.314,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Water splashes at lower octave)

90
0:04:58.626,000 --> 0:05:,000
And then they added a little bit of the splash

91
0:05:01.156,000 --> 0:05:03,000
from the overhead microphone.

92
0:05:03.464,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Water splashes)

93
0:05:06.653,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And by looping and repeating that sound,

94
0:05:09.215,000 --> 0:05:1,000
they got this:

95
0:05:10.429,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Propeller churns)

96
0:05:16.463,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So, creativity and technology put together in order to create the illusion

97
0:05:23.015,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that we're inside the submarine.

98
0:05:26.868,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But once you've created your sounds

99
0:05:30.253,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and you've synced them to the image,

100
0:05:32.671,000 --> 0:05:36,000
you want those sounds to live in the world of the story.

101
0:05:37.397,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And one the best ways to do that is to add reverb.

102
0:05:41.997,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So this is the first audio tool I want to talk about.

103
0:05:45.198,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Reverberation, or reverb, is the persistence of the sound

104
0:05:50.344,000 --> 0:05:51,000
after the original sound has ended.

105
0:05:52.299,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So it's sort of like the --

106
0:05:54.891,000 --> 0:05:57,000
all the reflections from the materials,

107
0:05:57.951,000 --> 0:05:59,000
the objects and the walls around the sound.

108
0:06:00.862,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Take, for example, the sound of a gunshot.

109
0:06:03.098,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The original sound is less than half a second long.

110
0:06:08.138,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Gunshot)

111
0:06:09.747,000 --> 0:06:1,000
By adding reverb,

112
0:06:11.46,000 --> 0:06:14,000
we can make it sound like it was recorded inside a bathroom.

113
0:06:15.47,000 --> 0:06:16,000
(Gunshot reverbs in bathroom)

114
0:06:17.057,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Or like it was recorded inside a chapel or a church.

115
0:06:20.887,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Gunshot reverbs church)

116
0:06:23.043,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Or in a canyon.

117
0:06:26.199,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Gunshot reverbs in canyon)

118
0:06:27.984,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So reverb gives us a lot of information

119
0:06:30.661,000 --> 0:06:34,000
about the space between the listener and the original sound source.

120
0:06:35.615,000 --> 0:06:37,000
If the sound is the taste,

121
0:06:37.748,000 --> 0:06:41,000
then reverb is sort of like the smell of the sound.

122
0:06:42.309,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But reverb can do a lot more.

123
0:06:44.491,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Listening to a sound with a lot less reverberation

124
0:06:48.425,000 --> 0:06:5,000
than the on-screen action

125
0:06:50.532,000 --> 0:06:53,000
is going to immediately signify to us

126
0:06:53.576,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that we're listening to a commentator,

127
0:06:56.243,000 --> 0:07:,000
to an objective narrator that's not participating in the on-screen action.

128
0:07:02.471,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Also, emotionally intimate moments in cinema

129
0:07:06.686,000 --> 0:07:07,000
are often heard with zero reverb,

130
0:07:08.657,000 --> 0:07:11,000
because that's how it would sound if someone was speaking inside our ear.

131
0:07:13.024,000 --> 0:07:14,000
On the completely other side,

132
0:07:15.009,000 --> 0:07:17,000
adding a lot of reverb to a voice

133
0:07:17.529,000 --> 0:07:2,000
is going to make us think that we're listening to a flashback,

134
0:07:21.637,000 --> 0:07:24,000
or perhaps that we're inside the head of a character

135
0:07:25.946,000 --> 0:07:27,000
or that we're listening to the voice of God.

136
0:07:28.446,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Or, even more powerful in film,

137
0:07:30.732,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Morgan Freeman.

138
0:07:32.243,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Laughter)

139
0:07:33.551,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So --

140
0:07:34.742,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Applause)

141
0:07:37.502,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But what are some other tools or hacks

142
0:07:41.397,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that sound designers use?

143
0:07:44.186,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Well, here's a really big one.

144
0:07:51.901,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It's silence.

145
0:07:53.807,000 --> 0:07:56,000
A few moments of silence is going to make us pay attention.

146
0:07:57.881,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And in the Western world,

147
0:08:00.345,000 --> 0:08:02,000
we're not really used to verbal silences.

148
0:08:02.492,000 --> 0:08:05,000
They're considered awkward or rude.

149
0:08:06.537,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So silence preceding verbal communication

150
0:08:11.021,000 --> 0:08:13,000
can create a lot of tension.

151
0:08:13.105,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But imagine a really big Hollywood movie,

152
0:08:16.834,000 --> 0:08:2,000
where it's full of explosions and automatic guns.

153
0:08:22.389,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Loud stops being loud anymore, after a while.

154
0:08:26.008,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So in a yin-yang way,

155
0:08:27.976,000 --> 0:08:3,000
silence needs loudness and loudness needs silence

156
0:08:31.137,000 --> 0:08:33,000
for either of them to have any effect.

157
0:08:34.35,000 --> 0:08:35,000
But what does silence mean?

158
0:08:35.751,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Well, it depends how it's used in each film.

159
0:08:39.416,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Silence can place us inside the head of a character

160
0:08:42.619,000 --> 0:08:43,000
or provoke thought.

161
0:08:44.261,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We often relate silences with ...

162
0:08:48.654,000 --> 0:08:49,000
contemplation,

163
0:08:50.558,000 --> 0:08:51,000
meditation,

164
0:08:53.185,000 --> 0:08:54,000
being deep in thought.

165
0:08:56.569,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But apart from having one meaning,

166
0:08:59.695,000 --> 0:09:01,000
silence becomes a blank canvas

167
0:09:01.889,000 --> 0:09:05,000
upon which the viewer is invited to the paint their own thoughts.

168
0:09:06.962,000 --> 0:09:09,000
But I want to make it clear: there is no such thing as silence.

169
0:09:11.192,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And I know this sounds like the most pretentious TED Talk statement ever.

170
0:09:16.835,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But even if you were to enter a room with zero reverberation

171
0:09:22.164,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and zero external sounds,

172
0:09:24.253,000 --> 0:09:27,000
you would still be able to hear the pumping of your own blood.

173
0:09:28.004,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And in cinema, traditionally, there was never a silent moment

174
0:09:32.345,000 --> 0:09:33,000
because of the sound of the projector.

175
0:09:34.716,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And even in today's Dolby world,

176
0:09:38.034,000 --> 0:09:41,000
there's not really any moment of silence if you listen around you.

177
0:09:42.485,000 --> 0:09:44,000
There's always some sort of noise.

178
0:09:44.734,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Now, since there's no such thing as silence,

179
0:09:47.685,000 --> 0:09:5,000
what do filmmakers and sound designers use?

180
0:09:51.28,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Well, as a synonym, they often use ambiences.

181
0:09:56.307,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Ambiences are the unique background sounds

182
0:10:00.2,000 --> 0:10:03,000
that are specific to each location.

183
0:10:03.272,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Each location has a unique sound,

184
0:10:05.145,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and each room has a unique sound,

185
0:10:07.145,000 --> 0:10:08,000
which is called room tone.

186
0:10:08.742,000 --> 0:10:1,000
So here's a recording of a market in Morocco.

187
0:10:11.189,000 --> 0:10:13,000
(Voices, music)

188
0:10:17.47,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And here's a recording of Times Square in New York.

189
0:10:20.843,000 --> 0:10:24,000
(Traffic sounds, car horns, voices)

190
0:10:27.449,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Room tone is the addition of all the noises inside the room:

191
0:10:31.095,000 --> 0:10:33,000
the ventilation, the heating, the fridge.

192
0:10:33.508,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Here's a recording of my apartment in Brooklyn.

193
0:10:36.443,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(You can hear the ventilation, the boiler, the fridge and street traffic)

194
0:10:47.422,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Ambiences work in a most primal way.

195
0:10:52.718,000 --> 0:10:54,000
They can speak directly to our brain subconsciously.

196
0:10:56.538,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So, birds chirping outside your window may indicate normality,

197
0:11:02.937,000 --> 0:11:04,000
perhaps because, as a species,

198
0:11:05.752,000 --> 0:11:09,000
we've been used to that sound every morning for millions of years.

199
0:11:10.36,000 --> 0:11:13,000
(Birds chirp)

200
0:11:17.839,000 --> 0:11:2,000
On the other hand, industrial sounds have been introduced to us

201
0:11:21.504,000 --> 0:11:22,000
a little more recently.

202
0:11:23.969,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Even though I really like them personally --

203
0:11:26.051,000 --> 0:11:28,000
they've been used by one of my heroes, David Lynch,

204
0:11:28.488,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and his sound designer, Alan Splet --

205
0:11:30.447,000 --> 0:11:32,000
industrial sounds often carry negative connotations.

206
0:11:33.033,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Machine noises)

207
0:11:40.092,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Now, sound effects can tap into our emotional memory.

208
0:11:46.869,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Occasionally, they can be so significant

209
0:11:49.25,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that they become a character in a movie.

210
0:11:52.569,000 --> 0:11:56,000
The sound of thunder may indicate divine intervention or anger.

211
0:11:58.373,000 --> 0:12:,000
(Thunder)

212
0:12:03.957,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Church bells can remind us of the passing of time,

213
0:12:07.956,000 --> 0:12:08,000
or perhaps our own mortality.

214
0:12:11.827,000 --> 0:12:14,000
(Bells ring)

215
0:12:19.773,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And breaking of glass can indicate the end of a relationship

216
0:12:24.287,000 --> 0:12:25,000
or a friendship.

217
0:12:26.39,000 --> 0:12:27,000
(Glass breaks)

218
0:12:28.788,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Scientists believe that dissonant sounds,

219
0:12:32.365,000 --> 0:12:36,000
for example, brass or wind instruments played very loud,

220
0:12:38.438,000 --> 0:12:42,000
may remind us of animal howls in nature

221
0:12:42.906,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and therefore create a sense of irritation or fear.

222
0:12:46.506,000 --> 0:12:48,000
(Brass and wind instruments play)

223
0:12:52.714,000 --> 0:12:55,000
So now we've spoken about on-screen sounds.

224
0:12:56.298,000 --> 0:13:,000
But occasionally, the source of a sound cannot be seen.

225
0:13:00.955,000 --> 0:13:02,000
That's what we call offscreen sounds,

226
0:13:03.503,000 --> 0:13:04,000
or "acousmatic."

227
0:13:05.641,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Acousmatic sounds --

228
0:13:07.887,000 --> 0:13:12,000
well, the term "acousmatic" comes from Pythagoras in ancient Greece,

229
0:13:12.944,000 --> 0:13:15,000
who used to teach behind a veil or curtain for years,

230
0:13:16.559,000 --> 0:13:19,000
not revealing himself to his disciples.

231
0:13:19.773,000 --> 0:13:21,000
I think the mathematician and philosopher thought that,

232
0:13:23.727,000 --> 0:13:24,000
in that way,

233
0:13:25.584,000 --> 0:13:29,000
his students might focus more on the voice,

234
0:13:29.645,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and his words and its meaning,

235
0:13:31.633,000 --> 0:13:34,000
rather than the visual of him speaking.

236
0:13:34.827,000 --> 0:13:36,000
So sort of like the Wizard of Oz,

237
0:13:37.55,000 --> 0:13:41,000
or "1984's" Big Brother,

238
0:13:42.388,000 --> 0:13:45,000
separating the voice from its source,

239
0:13:45.678,000 --> 0:13:46,000
separating cause and effect

240
0:13:48.379,000 --> 0:13:51,000
sort of creates a sense of ubiquity or panopticism,

241
0:13:52.198,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and therefore, authority.

242
0:13:55.156,000 --> 0:13:58,000
There's a strong tradition of acousmatic sound.

243
0:13:59.129,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Nuns in monasteries in Rome and Venice used to sing in rooms

244
0:14:05.763,000 --> 0:14:08,000
up in galleries close to the ceiling,

245
0:14:09.646,000 --> 0:14:12,000
creating the illusion that we're listening to angels up in the sky.

246
0:14:14.39,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Richard Wagner famously created the hidden orchestra

247
0:14:18.104,000 --> 0:14:21,000
that was placed in a pit between the stage and the audience.

248
0:14:21.964,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And one of my heroes, Aphex Twin, famously hid in dark corners of clubs.

249
0:14:27.42,000 --> 0:14:31,000
I think what all these masters knew is that by hiding the source,

250
0:14:32.187,000 --> 0:14:33,000
you create a sense of mystery.

251
0:14:33.874,000 --> 0:14:35,000
This has been seen in cinema over and over,

252
0:14:35.967,000 --> 0:14:38,000
with Hitchcock, and Ridley Scott in "Alien."

253
0:14:39.071,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Hearing a sound without knowing its source

254
0:14:41.487,000 --> 0:14:44,000
is going to create some sort of tension.

255
0:14:46.53,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Also, it can minimize certain visual restrictions that directors have

256
0:14:52.168,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and can show something that wasn't there during filming.

257
0:14:55.882,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And if all this sounds a little theoretical,

258
0:14:57.991,000 --> 0:14:59,000
I wanted to play a little video.

259
0:15:01.289,000 --> 0:15:03,000
(Toy squeaks)

260
0:15:04.383,000 --> 0:15:06,000
(Typewriter)

261
0:15:07.761,000 --> 0:15:09,000
(Drums)

262
0:15:11.164,000 --> 0:15:13,000
(Ping-pong)

263
0:15:14.484,000 --> 0:15:16,000
(Knives being sharpened)

264
0:15:17.786,000 --> 0:15:2,000
(Record scratches)

265
0:15:21.405,000 --> 0:15:22,000
(Saw cuts)

266
0:15:22.615,000 --> 0:15:23,000
(Woman screams)

267
0:15:24.663,000 --> 0:15:27,000
What I'm sort of trying to demonstrate with these tools

268
0:15:29.93,000 --> 0:15:31,000
is that sound is a language.

269
0:15:32.516,000 --> 0:15:35,000
It can trick us by transporting us geographically;

270
0:15:36.571,000 --> 0:15:37,000
it can change the mood;

271
0:15:38.579,000 --> 0:15:39,000
it can set the pace;

272
0:15:41.482,000 --> 0:15:44,000
it can make us laugh or it can make us scared.

273
0:15:46.698,000 --> 0:15:49,000
On a personal level, I fell in love with that language

274
0:15:50.072,000 --> 0:15:51,000
a few years ago,

275
0:15:51.413,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and somehow managed to make it into some sort of profession.

276
0:15:57.274,000 --> 0:16:,000
And I think with our work through the sound library,

277
0:16:00.524,000 --> 0:16:05,000
we're trying to kind of expand the vocabulary of that language.

278
0:16:07.797,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And in that way, we want to offer the right tools

279
0:16:11.303,000 --> 0:16:12,000
to sound designers,

280
0:16:12.967,000 --> 0:16:13,000
filmmakers,

281
0:16:14.339,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and video game and app designers,

282
0:16:16.748,000 --> 0:16:19,000
to keep telling even better stories

283
0:16:20.382,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and creating even more beautiful lies.

284
0:16:23.138,000 --> 0:16:24,000
So thanks for listening.

285
0:16:24.449,000 --> 0:16:27,000
(Applause)

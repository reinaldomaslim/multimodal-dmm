1
0:00:12.776,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What are you doing on this stage

2
0:00:17.21,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in front of all these people?

3
0:00:20.352,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:21.75,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Run!

5
0:00:22.925,000 --> 0:00:23,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:23.952,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Run now.

7
0:00:26.554,000 --> 0:00:28,000
That's the voice of my anxiety talking.

8
0:00:30.359,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Even when there's absolutely nothing wrong,

9
0:00:33.319,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I sometimes get this overwhelming sense of doom,

10
0:00:37.302,000 --> 0:00:39,000
like danger is lurking just around the corner.

11
0:00:40.877,000 --> 0:00:42,000
You see, a few years ago,

12
0:00:43.017,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety

13
0:00:45.538,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and depression --

14
0:00:47.109,000 --> 0:00:49,000
two conditions that often go hand in hand.

15
0:00:49.893,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Now, there was a time I wouldn't have told anybody,

16
0:00:54.182,000 --> 0:00:56,000
especially not in front of a big audience.

17
0:00:56.666,000 --> 0:00:57,000
As a black woman,

18
0:00:58.217,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I've had to develop extraordinary resilience to succeed.

19
0:01:01.881,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And like most people in my community,

20
0:01:03.884,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I had the misconception that depression was a sign of weakness,

21
0:01:07.716,000 --> 0:01:08,000
a character flaw.

22
0:01:09.276,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But I wasn't weak;

23
0:01:10.874,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I was a high achiever.

24
0:01:12.745,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I'd earned a Master's degree in Media Studies

25
0:01:14.972,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and had a string of high-profile jobs in the film and television industries.

26
0:01:19.554,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I'd even won two Emmy Awards for my hard work.

27
0:01:23.256,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Sure, I was totally spent,

28
0:01:26.296,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I lacked interest in things I used to enjoy,

29
0:01:28.99,000 --> 0:01:29,000
barely ate,

30
0:01:30.312,000 --> 0:01:31,000
struggled with insomnia

31
0:01:32.239,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and felt isolated and depleted.

32
0:01:35.382,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But depressed?

33
0:01:36.758,000 --> 0:01:37,000
No, not me.

34
0:01:39.741,000 --> 0:01:41,000
It took weeks before I could admit it,

35
0:01:41.971,000 --> 0:01:42,000
but the doctor was right:

36
0:01:43.424,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I was depressed.

37
0:01:45.231,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Still, I didn't tell anybody about my diagnosis.

38
0:01:49.342,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I was too ashamed.

39
0:01:50.979,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I didn't think I had the right to be depressed.

40
0:01:54.238,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I had a privileged life

41
0:01:55.892,000 --> 0:01:58,000
with a loving family and a successful career.

42
0:01:59.528,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And when I thought about the unspeakable horrors

43
0:02:02.144,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that my ancestors had been through in this country

44
0:02:04.656,000 --> 0:02:05,000
so that I could have it better,

45
0:02:06.648,000 --> 0:02:07,000
my shame grew even deeper.

46
0:02:08.8,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I was standing on their shoulders.

47
0:02:10.917,000 --> 0:02:11,000
How could I let them down?

48
0:02:13.202,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I would hold my head up,

49
0:02:15.279,000 --> 0:02:17,000
put a smile on my face

50
0:02:17.663,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and never tell a soul.

51
0:02:22.286,000 --> 0:02:25,000
On July 4, 2013,

52
0:02:26.299,000 --> 0:02:28,000
my world came crashing in on me.

53
0:02:29.219,000 --> 0:02:31,000
That was the day I got a phone call from my mom

54
0:02:32.144,000 --> 0:02:36,000
telling me that my 22-year-old nephew, Paul, had ended his life,

55
0:02:36.358,000 --> 0:02:38,000
after years of battling depression and anxiety.

56
0:02:40.488,000 --> 0:02:43,000
There are no words that can describe the devastation I felt.

57
0:02:44.487,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Paul and I were very close,

58
0:02:45.805,000 --> 0:02:47,000
but I had no idea he was in so much pain.

59
0:02:48.516,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Neither one of us had ever talked to the other about our struggles.

60
0:02:52.098,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The shame and stigma kept us both silent.

61
0:02:55.981,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Now, my way of dealing with adversity is to face it head on,

62
0:03:00.008,000 --> 0:03:03,000
so I spent the next two years researching depression and anxiety,

63
0:03:03.19,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and what I found was mind-blowing.

64
0:03:06.584,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The World Health Organization reports

65
0:03:08.582,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that depression is the leading cause of sickness and disability

66
0:03:13.83,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in the world.

67
0:03:15.859,000 --> 0:03:17,000
While the exact cause of depression isn't clear,

68
0:03:18.874,000 --> 0:03:21,000
research suggests that most mental disorders develop,

69
0:03:21.996,000 --> 0:03:22,000
at least in part,

70
0:03:23.747,000 --> 0:03:25,000
because of a chemical imbalance in the brain,

71
0:03:26.426,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and/or an underlying genetic predisposition.

72
0:03:30.861,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So you can't just shake it off.

73
0:03:34.727,000 --> 0:03:35,000
For black Americans,

74
0:03:36.482,000 --> 0:03:4,000
stressors like racism and socioeconomic disparities

75
0:03:40.562,000 --> 0:03:45,000
put them at a 20 percent greater risk of developing a mental disorder,

76
0:03:45.626,000 --> 0:03:47,000
yet they seek mental health services

77
0:03:48.062,000 --> 0:03:5,000
at about half the rate of white Americans.

78
0:03:51.364,000 --> 0:03:53,000
One reason is the stigma,

79
0:03:54.238,000 --> 0:04:,000
with 63 percent of black Americans mistaking depression for a weakness.

80
0:04:01.423,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Sadly, the suicide rate among black children

81
0:04:05.705,000 --> 0:04:07,000
has doubled in the past 20 years.

82
0:04:09.663,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Now, here's the good news:

83
0:04:12.423,000 --> 0:04:16,000
seventy percent of people struggling with depression will improve

84
0:04:16.729,000 --> 0:04:19,000
with therapy, treatment and medication.

85
0:04:21.278,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Armed with this information,

86
0:04:22.964,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I made a decision:

87
0:04:24.695,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I wasn't going to be silent anymore.

88
0:04:28.56,000 --> 0:04:29,000
With my family's blessing,

89
0:04:30.387,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I would share our story

90
0:04:32.304,000 --> 0:04:34,000
in hopes of sparking a national conversation.

91
0:04:35.96,000 --> 0:04:37,000
A friend, Kelly Pierre-Louis, said,

92
0:04:38.755,000 --> 0:04:4,000
"Being strong is killing us."

93
0:04:42.563,000 --> 0:04:43,000
She's right.

94
0:04:44.006,000 --> 0:04:48,000
We have got to retire those tired, old narratives

95
0:04:48.052,000 --> 0:04:49,000
of the strong black woman

96
0:04:49.631,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and the super-masculine black man,

97
0:04:51.865,000 --> 0:04:53,000
who, no matter how many times they get knocked down,

98
0:04:54.809,000 --> 0:04:56,000
just shake it off and soldier on.

99
0:04:57.59,000 --> 0:05:,000
Having feelings isn't a sign of weakness.

100
0:05:02.341,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Feelings mean we're human.

101
0:05:04.67,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And when we deny our humanity,

102
0:05:06.713,000 --> 0:05:08,000
it leaves us feeling empty inside,

103
0:05:08.853,000 --> 0:05:11,000
searching for ways to self-medicate in order to fill the void.

104
0:05:12.405,000 --> 0:05:14,000
My drug was high achievement.

105
0:05:16.191,000 --> 0:05:19,000
These days, I share my story openly,

106
0:05:19.516,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and I ask others to share theirs, too.

107
0:05:22.226,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I believe that's what it takes

108
0:05:23.698,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to help people who may be suffering in silence

109
0:05:26.317,000 --> 0:05:28,000
to know that they are not alone

110
0:05:28.55,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and to know that with help,

111
0:05:30.259,000 --> 0:05:31,000
they can heal.

112
0:05:31.624,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Now, I still have my struggles,

113
0:05:33.813,000 --> 0:05:35,000
particularly with the anxiety,

114
0:05:36.125,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but I'm able to manage it

115
0:05:37.752,000 --> 0:05:41,000
through daily mediation, yoga and a relatively healthy diet.

116
0:05:42.65,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:43.742,000 --> 0:05:45,000
If I feel like things are starting to spiral,

118
0:05:45.988,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I make an appointment to see my therapist,

119
0:05:48.056,000 --> 0:05:51,000
a dynamic black woman named Dawn Armstrong,

120
0:05:51.143,000 --> 0:05:52,000
who has a great sense of humor

121
0:05:53.14,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and a familiarity that I find comforting.

122
0:05:56.946,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I will always regret

123
0:05:59.21,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that I couldn't be there for my nephew.

124
0:06:02.046,000 --> 0:06:03,000
But my sincerest hope

125
0:06:04.515,000 --> 0:06:07,000
is that I can inspire others with the lesson that I've learned.

126
0:06:11.002,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Life is beautiful.

127
0:06:14.466,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Sometimes it's messy,

128
0:06:16.052,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and it's always unpredictable.

129
0:06:18.854,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But it will all be OK

130
0:06:20.081,000 --> 0:06:22,000
when you have your support system to help you through it.

131
0:06:23.333,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I hope that if your burden gets too heavy,

132
0:06:25.778,000 --> 0:06:26,000
you'll ask for a hand, too.

133
0:06:27.508,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Thank you.

134
0:06:28.699,000 --> 0:06:3,000
(Applause)

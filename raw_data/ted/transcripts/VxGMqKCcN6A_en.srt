1
0:00:27.063,000 --> 0:00:29,000
That splendid music, the coming-in music,

2
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"The Elephant March" from "Aida," is the music I've chosen for my funeral.

3
0:00:35.905,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And you can see why. It's triumphal.

5
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I won't feel anything, but if I could,

6
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I would feel triumphal at having lived at all,

7
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and at having lived on this splendid planet,

8
0:00:52.12,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and having been given the opportunity to understand

9
0:00:55.257,000 --> 0:01:01,000
something about why I was here in the first place, before not being here.

10
0:01:02.448,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Can you understand my quaint English accent?

11
0:01:06.891,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

12
0:01:09.651,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Like everybody else, I was entranced yesterday by the animal session.

13
0:01:14.75,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Robert Full and Frans Lanting and others;

14
0:01:20.213,000 --> 0:01:22,000
the beauty of the things that they showed.

15
0:01:22.463,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The only slight jarring note was when Jeffrey Katzenberg said of the mustang,

16
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:31,000
"the most splendid creatures that God put on this earth."

17
0:01:31.855,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Now of course, we know that he didn't really mean that,

18
0:01:35.48,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but in this country at the moment, you can't be too careful.

19
0:01:38.657,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I'm a biologist, and the central theorem of our subject: the theory of design,

21
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.

22
0:01:51.723,000 --> 0:01:55,000
In professional circles everywhere, it's of course universally accepted.

23
0:01:56,000 --> 0:02:01,000
In non-professional circles outside America, it's largely ignored.

24
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But in non-professional circles within America,

25
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
it arouses so much hostility --

26
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:1,000
(Laughter)

27
0:02:10.1,000 --> 0:02:14,000
it's fair to say that American biologists are in a state of war.

28
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
The war is so worrying at present,

29
0:02:17.999,000 --> 0:02:19,000
with court cases coming up in one state after another,

30
0:02:20.596,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that I felt I had to say something about it.

31
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
If you want to know what I have to say about Darwinism itself,

32
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I'm afraid you're going to have to look at my books,

33
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:32,000
which you won't find in the bookstore outside.

34
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Laughter)

35
0:02:36.467,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Contemporary court cases

36
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:41,000
often concern an allegedly new version of creationism,

37
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:45,000
called "Intelligent Design," or ID.

38
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Don't be fooled. There's nothing new about ID.

39
0:02:50.149,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It's just creationism under another name,

40
0:02:53.523,000 --> 0:02:56,000
rechristened -- I choose the word advisedly --

41
0:02:56.905,000 --> 0:02:57,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:58,000 --> 0:02:59,000
for tactical, political reasons.

43
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The arguments of so-called ID theorists

44
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:05,000
are the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again,

45
0:03:05.396,000 --> 0:03:07,000
since Darwin down to the present day.

46
0:03:08.908,000 --> 0:03:11,000
There is an effective evolution lobby

47
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
coordinating the fight on behalf of science,

48
0:03:14.12,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and I try to do all I can to help them,

49
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:2,000
but they get quite upset when people like me dare to mention

50
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that we happen to be atheists as well as evolutionists.

51
0:03:25.302,000 --> 0:03:29,000
They see us as rocking the boat, and you can understand why.

52
0:03:30.689,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Creationists, lacking any coherent scientific argument for their case,

53
0:03:35.442,000 --> 0:03:39,000
fall back on the popular phobia against atheism:

54
0:03:40.42,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Teach your children evolution in biology class,

55
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and they'll soon move on to drugs, grand larceny and sexual "pre-version."

56
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:56,000
In fact, of course, educated theologians from the Pope down

58
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
are firm in their support of evolution.

59
0:03:59.886,000 --> 0:04:01,000
This book, "Finding Darwin's God," by Kenneth Miller,

60
0:04:02.829,000 --> 0:04:06,000
is one of the most effective attacks on Intelligent Design that I know

61
0:04:06.916,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and it's all the more effective because it's written by a devout Christian.

62
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:15,000
People like Kenneth Miller could be called a "godsend" to the evolution lobby,

63
0:04:15.606,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Laughter)

64
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:21,000
because they expose the lie that evolutionism is, as a matter of fact,

65
0:04:21.751,000 --> 0:04:22,000
tantamount to atheism.

66
0:04:23.398,000 --> 0:04:26,000
People like me, on the other hand, rock the boat.

67
0:04:28.175,000 --> 0:04:3,000
But here, I want to say something nice about creationists.

68
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It's not a thing I often do, so listen carefully.

69
0:04:33.7,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Laughter)

70
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I think they're right about one thing.

71
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I think they're right that evolution

72
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
is fundamentally hostile to religion.

73
0:04:43.643,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I've already said that many individual evolutionists, like the Pope,

74
0:04:46.881,000 --> 0:04:49,000
are also religious, but I think they're deluding themselves.

75
0:04:50.46,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I believe a true understanding of Darwinism

76
0:04:53.428,000 --> 0:04:56,000
is deeply corrosive to religious faith.

77
0:04:58.349,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Now, it may sound as though I'm about to preach atheism,

78
0:05:03.596,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and I want to reassure you that that's not what I'm going to do.

79
0:05:07.452,000 --> 0:05:1,000
In an audience as sophisticated as this one,

80
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that would be preaching to the choir.

81
0:05:13.853,000 --> 0:05:15,000
No, what I want to urge upon you --

82
0:05:16.497,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Laughter)

83
0:05:20.264,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Instead, what I want to urge upon you is militant atheism.

84
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:26,000
(Laughter)

85
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Applause)

86
0:05:30.222,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But that's putting it too negatively.

87
0:05:33.001,000 --> 0:05:37,000
If I was a person who were interested in preserving religious faith,

88
0:05:37.674,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I would be very afraid of the positive power of evolutionary science,

89
0:05:42.847,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and indeed science generally, but evolution in particular,

90
0:05:45.72,000 --> 0:05:5,000
to inspire and enthrall, precisely because it is atheistic.

91
0:05:53.337,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Now, the difficult problem for any theory of biological design

92
0:05:57.114,000 --> 0:06:02,000
is to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things.

93
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Statistical improbability in the direction of good design --

94
0:06:07.796,000 --> 0:06:08,000
"complexity" is another word for this.

95
0:06:10.269,000 --> 0:06:11,000
The standard creationist argument --

96
0:06:12.04,000 --> 0:06:14,000
there is only one; they're all reduced to this one --

97
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
takes off from a statistical improbability.

98
0:06:17.404,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Living creatures are too complex to have come about by chance;

99
0:06:20.714,000 --> 0:06:22,000
therefore, they must have had a designer.

100
0:06:23.594,000 --> 0:06:25,000
This argument of course, shoots itself in the foot.

101
0:06:26.062,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Any designer capable of designing something really complex

102
0:06:29.401,000 --> 0:06:31,000
has to be even more complex himself,

103
0:06:32.006,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and that's before we even start on the other things he's expected to do,

104
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:39,000
like forgive sins, bless marriages, listen to prayers --

105
0:06:39.938,000 --> 0:06:41,000
favor our side in a war --

106
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:44,000
(Laughter)

107
0:06:44.41,000 --> 0:06:46,000
disapprove of our sex lives, and so on.

108
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:48,000
(Laughter)

109
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve,

110
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and you can't solve it by postulating an agent that is even more complex,

111
0:06:58.731,000 --> 0:07:,000
thereby simply compounding the problem.

112
0:07:01.928,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Darwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant

113
0:07:06.349,000 --> 0:07:09,000
because it solves the problem of explaining complexity

114
0:07:10.198,000 --> 0:07:13,000
in terms of nothing but simplicity.

115
0:07:14.094,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Essentially, it does it by providing a smooth ramp

116
0:07:17.387,000 --> 0:07:2,000
of gradual, step-by-step increment.

117
0:07:21.757,000 --> 0:07:22,000
But here, I only want to make the point

118
0:07:23.654,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that the elegance of Darwinism is corrosive to religion,

119
0:07:27.368,000 --> 0:07:31,000
precisely because it is so elegant, so parsimonious, so powerful,

120
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:33,000
so economically powerful.

121
0:07:36.285,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It has the sinewy economy of a beautiful suspension bridge.

122
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:45,000
The God theory is not just a bad theory.

123
0:07:45.615,000 --> 0:07:46,000
It turns out to be -- in principle --

124
0:07:47.409,000 --> 0:07:5,000
incapable of doing the job required of it.

125
0:07:51.464,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So, returning to tactics and the evolution lobby,

126
0:07:54.599,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I want to argue that rocking the boat

127
0:07:57.745,000 --> 0:08:01,000
may be just the right thing to do.

128
0:08:03.452,000 --> 0:08:05,000
My approach to attacking creationism is --

129
0:08:06.072,000 --> 0:08:08,000
unlike the evolution lobby --

130
0:08:08.579,000 --> 0:08:12,000
my approach to attacking creationism is to attack religion as a whole.

131
0:08:14.356,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And at this point I need to acknowledge the remarkable taboo

132
0:08:18.642,000 --> 0:08:2,000
against speaking ill of religion,

133
0:08:21.152,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and I'm going to do so in the words of the late Douglas Adams,

134
0:08:24.525,000 --> 0:08:26,000
a dear friend who, if he never came to TED,

135
0:08:26.788,000 --> 0:08:27,000
certainly should have been invited.

136
0:08:28.794,000 --> 0:08:29,000
(Richard Saul Wurman: He was.)

137
0:08:30.285,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Richard Dawkins: He was. Good. I thought he must have been.

138
0:08:33.332,000 --> 0:08:35,000
He begins this speech, which was tape recorded in Cambridge

139
0:08:36.2,000 --> 0:08:37,000
shortly before he died --

140
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:42,000
he begins by explaining how science works through the testing of hypotheses

141
0:08:42.597,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that are framed to be vulnerable to disproof, and then he goes on.

142
0:08:46.224,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I quote, "Religion doesn't seem to work like that.

143
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:53,000
It has certain ideas at the heart of it, which we call 'sacred' or 'holy.'

144
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:56,000
What it means is: here is an idea or a notion

145
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:,000
that you're not allowed to say anything bad about.

146
0:09:00.679,000 --> 0:09:04,000
You're just not. Why not? Because you're not."

147
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:08,000
(Laughter)

148
0:09:08.928,000 --> 0:09:1,000
"Why should it be that it's perfectly legitimate

149
0:09:11.373,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to support the Republicans or Democrats,

150
0:09:13.386,000 --> 0:09:15,000
this model of economics versus that,

151
0:09:15.77,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Macintosh instead of Windows,

152
0:09:17.759,000 --> 0:09:19,000
but to have an opinion about how the universe began,

153
0:09:20.744,000 --> 0:09:21,000
about who created the universe --

154
0:09:22.404,000 --> 0:09:23,000
no, that's holy.

155
0:09:24.784,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So, we're used to not challenging religious ideas,

156
0:09:28.174,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and it's very interesting how much of a furor Richard creates

157
0:09:31.388,000 --> 0:09:32,000
when he does it." --

158
0:09:32.571,000 --> 0:09:33,000
He meant me, not that one.

159
0:09:35.578,000 --> 0:09:37,000
"Everybody gets absolutely frantic about it,

160
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:4,000
because you're not allowed to say these things.

161
0:09:40.612,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Yet when you look at it rationally,

162
0:09:42.333,000 --> 0:09:44,000
there's no reason why those ideas

163
0:09:44.453,000 --> 0:09:46,000
shouldn't be as open to debate as any other,

164
0:09:47.152,000 --> 0:09:5,000
except that we've agreed somehow between us

165
0:09:50.245,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that they shouldn't be."

166
0:09:51.983,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And that's the end of the quote from Douglas.

167
0:09:56.864,000 --> 0:10:,000
In my view, not only is science corrosive to religion;

168
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:04,000
religion is corrosive to science.

169
0:10:04.698,000 --> 0:10:07,000
It teaches people to be satisfied with trivial,

170
0:10:08.595,000 --> 0:10:11,000
supernatural non-explanations,

171
0:10:11.642,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and blinds them to the wonderful, real explanations

172
0:10:15.397,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that we have within our grasp.

173
0:10:17.595,000 --> 0:10:23,000
It teaches them to accept authority, revelation and faith,

174
0:10:23.66,000 --> 0:10:26,000
instead of always insisting on evidence.

175
0:10:29.081,000 --> 0:10:33,000
There's Douglas Adams, magnificent picture from his book, "Last Chance to See."

176
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Now, there's a typical scientific journal,

177
0:10:37.684,000 --> 0:10:38,000
The Quarterly Review of Biology.

178
0:10:39.341,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And I'm going to put together, as guest editor,

179
0:10:42.221,000 --> 0:10:47,000
a special issue on the question, "Did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs?"

180
0:10:47.49,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And the first paper is a standard scientific paper,

181
0:10:51.611,000 --> 0:10:52,000
presenting evidence,

182
0:10:53.51,000 --> 0:10:54,000
"Iridium layer at the K-T boundary,

183
0:10:55.269,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and potassium argon dated crater in Yucatan,

184
0:10:57.714,000 --> 0:10:59,000
indicate that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."

185
0:11:00.349,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Perfectly ordinary scientific paper.

186
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Now, the next one.

187
0:11:04.557,000 --> 0:11:06,000
"The President of the Royal Society

188
0:11:07.246,000 --> 0:11:11,000
has been vouchsafed a strong inner conviction

189
0:11:11.758,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."

190
0:11:14.285,000 --> 0:11:15,000
(Laughter)

191
0:11:18.53,000 --> 0:11:23,000
"It has been privately revealed to Professor Huxtane

192
0:11:24.356,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."

193
0:11:26.301,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Laughter)

194
0:11:29.96,000 --> 0:11:31,000
"Professor Hordley was brought up

195
0:11:32.285,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to have total and unquestioning faith" --

196
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:36,000
(Laughter) --

197
0:11:36.056,000 --> 0:11:4,000
"that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."

198
0:11:43.459,000 --> 0:11:47,000
"Professor Hawkins has promulgated an official dogma

199
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:51,000
binding on all loyal Hawkinsians

200
0:11:51.468,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."

201
0:11:54.361,000 --> 0:11:55,000
(Laughter)

202
0:11:57.523,000 --> 0:12:,000
That's inconceivable, of course.

203
0:12:01.848,000 --> 0:12:02,000
But suppose --

204
0:12:03.102,000 --> 0:12:06,000
[Supporters of the Asteroid Theory cannot be patriotic citizens]

205
0:12:06.172,000 --> 0:12:07,000
(Laughter)

206
0:12:07.911,000 --> 0:12:09,000
(Applause)

207
0:12:12.774,000 --> 0:12:15,000
In 1987, a reporter asked George Bush, Sr.

208
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
whether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism

209
0:12:19.842,000 --> 0:12:21,000
of Americans who are atheists.

210
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Mr. Bush's reply has become infamous.

211
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:28,000
"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered citizens,

212
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:3,000
nor should they be considered patriots.

213
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:33,000
This is one nation under God."

214
0:12:34.571,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Bush's bigotry was not an isolated mistake,

215
0:12:37.214,000 --> 0:12:4,000
blurted out in the heat of the moment and later retracted.

216
0:12:40.523,000 --> 0:12:44,000
He stood by it in the face of repeated calls for clarification or withdrawal.

217
0:12:45.394,000 --> 0:12:46,000
He really meant it.

218
0:12:46.648,000 --> 0:12:5,000
More to the point, he knew it posed no threat to his election --

219
0:12:51.227,000 --> 0:12:52,000
quite the contrary.

220
0:12:52.433,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Democrats as well as Republicans parade their religiousness

221
0:12:56.187,000 --> 0:12:57,000
if they want to get elected.

222
0:12:57.935,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Both parties invoke "one nation under God."

223
0:13:02.119,000 --> 0:13:04,000
What would Thomas Jefferson have said?

224
0:13:04.455,000 --> 0:13:07,000
[In every country and in every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty]

225
0:13:08.105,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Incidentally, I'm not usually very proud of being British,

226
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:15,000
but you can't help making the comparison.

227
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
(Applause)

228
0:13:24.485,000 --> 0:13:26,000
In practice, what is an atheist?

229
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:31,000
An atheist is just somebody who feels about Yahweh

230
0:13:31.332,000 --> 0:13:37,000
the way any decent Christian feels about Thor or Baal or the golden calf.

231
0:13:37.619,000 --> 0:13:41,000
As has been said before, we are all atheists about most of the gods

232
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that humanity has ever believed in.

233
0:13:44.329,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Some of us just go one god further.

234
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:49,000
(Laughter)

235
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:56,000
(Applause)

236
0:13:57,000 --> 0:14:,000
And however we define atheism, it's surely the kind of academic belief

237
0:14:00.358,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that a person is entitled to hold without being vilified

238
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:08,000
as an unpatriotic, unelectable non-citizen.

239
0:14:09.045,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Nevertheless, it's an undeniable fact that to own up to being an atheist

240
0:14:12.453,000 --> 0:14:16,000
is tantamount to introducing yourself as Mr. Hitler or Miss Beelzebub.

241
0:14:17.583,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And that all stems from the perception of atheists

242
0:14:21.309,000 --> 0:14:24,000
as some kind of weird, way-out minority.

243
0:14:25.889,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Natalie Angier wrote a rather sad piece in the New Yorker,

244
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:31,000
saying how lonely she felt as an atheist.

245
0:14:31.42,000 --> 0:14:33,000
She clearly feels in a beleaguered minority.

246
0:14:33.882,000 --> 0:14:38,000
But actually, how do American atheists stack up numerically?

247
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:42,000
The latest survey makes surprisingly encouraging reading.

248
0:14:43.296,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Christianity, of course, takes a massive lion's share of the population,

249
0:14:46.75,000 --> 0:14:47,000
with nearly 160 million.

250
0:14:49.256,000 --> 0:14:52,000
But what would you think was the second largest group,

251
0:14:52.757,000 --> 0:14:57,000
convincingly outnumbering Jews with 2.8 million, Muslims at 1.1 million,

252
0:14:58.217,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Hindus, Buddhists and all other religions put together?

253
0:15:01.891,000 --> 0:15:03,000
The second largest group, with nearly 30 million,

254
0:15:04.558,000 --> 0:15:07,000
is the one described as non-religious or secular.

255
0:15:08.701,000 --> 0:15:11,000
You can't help wondering why vote-seeking politicians

256
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:17,000
are so proverbially overawed by the power of, for example, the Jewish lobby --

257
0:15:17.206,000 --> 0:15:21,000
the state of Israel seems to owe its very existence to the American Jewish vote --

258
0:15:21.547,000 --> 0:15:22,000
while at the same time,

259
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:27,000
consigning the non-religious to political oblivion.

260
0:15:28.344,000 --> 0:15:31,000
This secular non-religious vote, if properly mobilized,

261
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:34,000
is nine times as numerous as the Jewish vote.

262
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Why does this far more substantial minority

263
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:42,000
not make a move to exercise its political muscle?

264
0:15:43.285,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Well, so much for quantity. How about quality?

265
0:15:46.539,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Is there any correlation, positive or negative,

266
0:15:49.666,000 --> 0:15:53,000
between intelligence and tendency to be religious?

267
0:15:53.701,000 --> 0:15:55,000
[Them folks misunderestimated me]

268
0:15:55.962,000 --> 0:15:59,000
(Laughter)

269
0:16:00.582,000 --> 0:16:03,000
The survey that I quoted, which is the ARIS survey,

270
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:07,000
didn't break down its data by socio-economic class or education,

271
0:16:07.072,000 --> 0:16:08,000
IQ or anything else.

272
0:16:08.818,000 --> 0:16:12,000
But a recent article by Paul G. Bell in the Mensa magazine

273
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:14,000
provides some straws in the wind.

274
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Mensa, as you know, is an international organization

275
0:16:17.501,000 --> 0:16:2,000
for people with very high IQ.

276
0:16:20.835,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And from a meta-analysis of the literature,

277
0:16:25.794,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Bell concludes that, I quote -- "Of 43 studies carried out since 1927

278
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:33,000
on the relationship between religious belief,

279
0:16:33.319,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and one's intelligence or educational level,

280
0:16:35.809,000 --> 0:16:39,000
all but four found an inverse connection.

281
0:16:4,000 --> 0:16:43,000
That is, the higher one's intelligence or educational level,

282
0:16:43.641,000 --> 0:16:45,000
the less one is likely to be religious."

283
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Well, I haven't seen the original 42 studies,

284
0:16:48.199,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and I can't comment on that meta-analysis,

285
0:16:51.231,000 --> 0:16:54,000
but I would like to see more studies done along those lines.

286
0:16:54.968,000 --> 0:16:57,000
And I know that there are -- if I could put a little plug here --

287
0:16:58.055,000 --> 0:16:59,000
there are people in this audience

288
0:16:59.675,000 --> 0:17:04,000
easily capable of financing a massive research survey to settle the question,

289
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and I put the suggestion up, for what it's worth.

290
0:17:07.609,000 --> 0:17:08,000
But let me know show you some data

291
0:17:09.283,000 --> 0:17:11,000
that have been properly published and analyzed,

292
0:17:11.536,000 --> 0:17:14,000
on one special group -- namely, top scientists.

293
0:17:16.444,000 --> 0:17:21,000
In 1998, Larson and Witham polled the cream of American scientists,

294
0:17:22,000 --> 0:17:25,000
those who'd been honored by election to the National Academy of Sciences,

295
0:17:25.715,000 --> 0:17:27,000
and among this select group,

296
0:17:28.37,000 --> 0:17:33,000
belief in a personal God dropped to a shattering seven percent.

297
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:39,000
About 20 percent are agnostic; the rest could fairly be called atheists.

298
0:17:39.771,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Similar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality.

299
0:17:43,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Among biological scientists, the figure is even lower:

300
0:17:46,000 --> 0:17:49,000
5.5 percent, only, believe in God.

301
0:17:49.779,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Physical scientists, it's 7.5 percent.

302
0:17:53,000 --> 0:17:55,000
I've not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars

303
0:17:56,000 --> 0:17:58,000
in other fields, such as history or philosophy,

304
0:17:59,000 --> 0:18:01,000
but I'd be surprised if they were different.

305
0:18:02.491,000 --> 0:18:05,000
So, we've reached a truly remarkable situation,

306
0:18:05.738,000 --> 0:18:1,000
a grotesque mismatch between the American intelligentsia

307
0:18:10.777,000 --> 0:18:11,000
and the American electorate.

308
0:18:13.364,000 --> 0:18:16,000
A philosophical opinion about the nature of the universe,

309
0:18:17,000 --> 0:18:2,000
which is held by the vast majority of top American scientists

310
0:18:21,000 --> 0:18:24,000
and probably the majority of the intelligentsia generally,

311
0:18:24.88,000 --> 0:18:26,000
is so abhorrent to the American electorate

312
0:18:27.704,000 --> 0:18:31,000
that no candidate for popular election dare affirm it in public.

313
0:18:33.077,000 --> 0:18:35,000
If I'm right, this means that high office

314
0:18:36,000 --> 0:18:38,000
in the greatest country in the world

315
0:18:38.67,000 --> 0:18:42,000
is barred to the very people best qualified to hold it --

316
0:18:42.781,000 --> 0:18:43,000
the intelligentsia --

317
0:18:44,000 --> 0:18:46,000
unless they are prepared to lie about their beliefs.

318
0:18:47,000 --> 0:18:5,000
To put it bluntly: American political opportunities

319
0:18:50.518,000 --> 0:18:52,000
are heavily loaded against those

320
0:18:53,000 --> 0:18:55,000
who are simultaneously intelligent and honest.

321
0:18:55.809,000 --> 0:18:56,000
(Laughter)

322
0:18:57.039,000 --> 0:19:03,000
(Applause)

323
0:19:03.374,000 --> 0:19:06,000
I'm not a citizen of this country, so I hope it won't be thought unbecoming

324
0:19:07,000 --> 0:19:09,000
if I suggest that something needs to be done.

325
0:19:1,000 --> 0:19:12,000
(Laughter)

326
0:19:12.524,000 --> 0:19:14,000
And I've already hinted what that something is.

327
0:19:15,000 --> 0:19:18,000
From what I've seen of TED, I think this may be the ideal place to launch it.

328
0:19:19.479,000 --> 0:19:21,000
Again, I fear it will cost money.

329
0:19:21.654,000 --> 0:19:23,000
We need a consciousness-raising,

330
0:19:24.225,000 --> 0:19:27,000
coming-out campaign for American atheists.

331
0:19:28,000 --> 0:19:29,000
(Laughter)

332
0:19:3,000 --> 0:19:33,000
This could be similar to the campaign organized by homosexuals

333
0:19:33.744,000 --> 0:19:34,000
a few years ago,

334
0:19:35,000 --> 0:19:38,000
although heaven forbid that we should stoop to public outing

335
0:19:38.357,000 --> 0:19:39,000
of people against their will.

336
0:19:4,000 --> 0:19:42,000
In most cases, people who out themselves

337
0:19:43,000 --> 0:19:46,000
will help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists.

338
0:19:47,000 --> 0:19:48,000
On the contrary,

339
0:19:48.177,000 --> 0:19:51,000
they'll demonstrate that atheists are often the kinds of people

340
0:19:51.271,000 --> 0:19:53,000
who could serve as decent role models for your children,

341
0:19:54,000 --> 0:19:58,000
the kinds of people an advertising agent could use to recommend a product,

342
0:19:58.791,000 --> 0:20:,000
the kinds of people who are sitting in this room.

343
0:20:03,000 --> 0:20:05,000
There should be a snowball effect, a positive feedback,

344
0:20:06,000 --> 0:20:08,000
such that the more names we have, the more we get.

345
0:20:09.59,000 --> 0:20:11,000
There could be non-linearities, threshold effects.

346
0:20:12.383,000 --> 0:20:14,000
When a critical mass has been obtained,

347
0:20:14.486,000 --> 0:20:16,000
there's an abrupt acceleration in recruitment.

348
0:20:17.415,000 --> 0:20:18,000
And again, it will need money.

349
0:20:20.494,000 --> 0:20:23,000
I suspect that the word "atheist" itself

350
0:20:24,000 --> 0:20:27,000
contains or remains a stumbling block

351
0:20:27.491,000 --> 0:20:29,000
far out of proportion to what it actually means,

352
0:20:30.191,000 --> 0:20:31,000
and a stumbling block to people

353
0:20:31.788,000 --> 0:20:34,000
who otherwise might be happy to out themselves.

354
0:20:34.869,000 --> 0:20:36,000
So, what other words might be used to smooth the path,

355
0:20:37.618,000 --> 0:20:39,000
oil the wheels, sugar the pill?

356
0:20:41.382,000 --> 0:20:43,000
Darwin himself preferred "agnostic" --

357
0:20:44.404,000 --> 0:20:47,000
and not only out of loyalty to his friend Huxley,

358
0:20:47.532,000 --> 0:20:48,000
who coined the term.

359
0:20:49.733,000 --> 0:20:51,000
Darwin said, "I have never been an atheist

360
0:20:52.59,000 --> 0:20:54,000
in the same sense of denying the existence of a God.

361
0:20:55.796,000 --> 0:20:57,000
I think that generally an 'agnostic'

362
0:20:58,000 --> 0:21:01,000
would be the most correct description of my state of mind."

363
0:21:01.846,000 --> 0:21:05,000
He even became uncharacteristically tetchy with Edward Aveling.

364
0:21:07.259,000 --> 0:21:08,000
Aveling was a militant atheist

365
0:21:09,000 --> 0:21:1,000
who failed to persuade Darwin

366
0:21:11,000 --> 0:21:13,000
to accept the dedication of his book on atheism --

367
0:21:14,000 --> 0:21:16,000
incidentally, giving rise to a fascinating myth

368
0:21:16.714,000 --> 0:21:19,000
that Karl Marx tried to dedicate "Das Kapital" to Darwin,

369
0:21:20.135,000 --> 0:21:22,000
which he didn't, it was actually Edward Aveling.

370
0:21:22.527,000 --> 0:21:26,000
What happened was that Aveling's mistress was Marx's daughter,

371
0:21:27,000 --> 0:21:3,000
and when both Darwin and Marx were dead,

372
0:21:30.305,000 --> 0:21:34,000
Marx's papers became muddled up with Aveling's papers,

373
0:21:34.543,000 --> 0:21:38,000
and a letter from Darwin saying, "My dear sir, thank you very much

374
0:21:38.874,000 --> 0:21:4,000
but I don't want you to dedicate your book to me,"

375
0:21:41.261,000 --> 0:21:44,000
was mistakenly supposed to be addressed to Marx,

376
0:21:44.538,000 --> 0:21:47,000
and that gave rise to this whole myth, which you've probably heard.

377
0:21:47.879,000 --> 0:21:51,000
It's a sort of urban myth, that Marx tried to dedicate "Kapital" to Darwin.

378
0:21:52.442,000 --> 0:21:58,000
Anyway, it was Aveling, and when they met, Darwin challenged Aveling.

379
0:21:59.682,000 --> 0:22:02,000
"Why do you call yourselves atheists?"

380
0:22:07.148,000 --> 0:22:11,000
"'Agnostic, '" retorted Aveling, "was simply 'atheist' writ respectable,

381
0:22:11.459,000 --> 0:22:14,000
and 'atheist' was simply 'agnostic' writ aggressive."

382
0:22:15.292,000 --> 0:22:18,000
Darwin complained, "But why should you be so aggressive?"

383
0:22:19.141,000 --> 0:22:22,000
Darwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia,

384
0:22:22.761,000 --> 0:22:25,000
but that ordinary people were not, quote, "ripe for it."

385
0:22:26.857,000 --> 0:22:29,000
Which is, of course, our old friend, the "don't rock the boat" argument.

386
0:22:31,000 --> 0:22:35,000
It's not recorded whether Aveling told Darwin to come down off his high horse.

387
0:22:36,000 --> 0:22:37,000
(Laughter)

388
0:22:37.851,000 --> 0:22:39,000
But in any case, that was more than 100 years ago.

389
0:22:40.225,000 --> 0:22:42,000
You'd think we might have grown up since then.

390
0:22:43.129,000 --> 0:22:48,000
Now, a friend, an intelligent lapsed Jew,

391
0:22:48.417,000 --> 0:22:52,000
who, incidentally, observes the Sabbath for reasons of cultural solidarity,

392
0:22:52.566,000 --> 0:22:55,000
describes himself as a "tooth-fairy agnostic."

393
0:22:57.066,000 --> 0:22:58,000
He won't call himself an atheist

394
0:22:58.653,000 --> 0:23:01,000
because it's, in principle, impossible to prove a negative,

395
0:23:02,000 --> 0:23:04,000
but "agnostic" on its own might suggest that God's existence

396
0:23:05,000 --> 0:23:1,000
was therefore on equal terms of likelihood as his non-existence.

397
0:23:10.166,000 --> 0:23:14,000
So, my friend is strictly agnostic about the tooth fairy,

398
0:23:14.507,000 --> 0:23:16,000
but it isn't very likely, is it?

399
0:23:17.524,000 --> 0:23:18,000
Like God.

400
0:23:19,000 --> 0:23:21,000
Hence the phrase, "tooth-fairy agnostic."

401
0:23:21.329,000 --> 0:23:22,000
Bertrand Russell made the same point

402
0:23:23.115,000 --> 0:23:26,000
using a hypothetical teapot in orbit about Mars.

403
0:23:27.138,000 --> 0:23:28,000
You would strictly have to be agnostic

404
0:23:29,000 --> 0:23:31,000
about whether there is a teapot in orbit about Mars,

405
0:23:31.453,000 --> 0:23:34,000
but that doesn't mean you treat the likelihood of its existence

406
0:23:34.477,000 --> 0:23:36,000
as on all fours with its non-existence.

407
0:23:37.305,000 --> 0:23:4,000
The list of things which we strictly have to be agnostic about

408
0:23:40.634,000 --> 0:23:43,000
doesn't stop at tooth fairies and teapots; it's infinite.

409
0:23:44,000 --> 0:23:46,000
If you want to believe one particular one of them --

410
0:23:46.501,000 --> 0:23:5,000
unicorns or tooth fairies or teapots or Yahweh --

411
0:23:50.605,000 --> 0:23:52,000
the onus is on you to say why.

412
0:23:53,000 --> 0:23:56,000
The onus is not on the rest of us to say why not.

413
0:23:57,000 --> 0:23:58,000
We, who are atheists,

414
0:23:58.406,000 --> 0:24:01,000
are also a-fairyists and a-teapotists.

415
0:24:01.821,000 --> 0:24:03,000
(Laughter)

416
0:24:04.486,000 --> 0:24:05,000
But we don't bother to say so.

417
0:24:06.843,000 --> 0:24:09,000
And this is why my friend uses "tooth-fairy agnostic"

418
0:24:10.693,000 --> 0:24:12,000
as a label for what most people would call atheist.

419
0:24:13.679,000 --> 0:24:18,000
Nonetheless, if we want to attract deep-down atheists to come out publicly,

420
0:24:19.122,000 --> 0:24:22,000
we're going to have find something better to stick on our banner

421
0:24:22.235,000 --> 0:24:24,000
than "tooth-fairy" or "teapot agnostic."

422
0:24:25.643,000 --> 0:24:26,000
So, how about "humanist"?

423
0:24:29.58,000 --> 0:24:33,000
This has the advantage of a worldwide network of well-organized associations

424
0:24:34,000 --> 0:24:35,000
and journals and things already in place.

425
0:24:36,000 --> 0:24:38,000
My problem with it is only its apparent anthropocentrism.

426
0:24:38.972,000 --> 0:24:4,000
One of the things we've learned from Darwin

427
0:24:41.002,000 --> 0:24:43,000
is that the human species is only one

428
0:24:43.502,000 --> 0:24:46,000
among millions of cousins, some close, some distant.

429
0:24:47.33,000 --> 0:24:49,000
And there are other possibilities, like "naturalist,"

430
0:24:49.887,000 --> 0:24:51,000
but that also has problems of confusion,

431
0:24:52.346,000 --> 0:24:54,000
because Darwin would have thought naturalist --

432
0:24:54.576,000 --> 0:24:57,000
"Naturalist" means, of course, as opposed to "supernaturalist" --

433
0:24:57.735,000 --> 0:24:58,000
and it is used sometimes --

434
0:24:59.123,000 --> 0:25:02,000
Darwin would have been confused by the other sense of "naturalist,"

435
0:25:02.541,000 --> 0:25:03,000
which he was, of course,

436
0:25:03.756,000 --> 0:25:07,000
and I suppose there might be others who would confuse it with "nudism".

437
0:25:08.772,000 --> 0:25:09,000
(Laughter)

438
0:25:10.014,000 --> 0:25:16,000
Such people might be those belonging to the British lynch mob,

439
0:25:16.936,000 --> 0:25:21,000
which last year attacked a pediatrician in mistake for a pedophile.

440
0:25:22,000 --> 0:25:25,000
(Laughter)

441
0:25:27.549,000 --> 0:25:3,000
I think the best of the available alternatives for "atheist"

442
0:25:30.733,000 --> 0:25:31,000
is simply "non-theist."

443
0:25:32,000 --> 0:25:35,000
It lacks the strong connotation that there's definitely no God,

444
0:25:35.024,000 --> 0:25:4,000
and it could therefore easily be embraced by teapot or tooth-fairy agnostics.

445
0:25:40.907,000 --> 0:25:45,000
It's completely compatible with the God of the physicists.

446
0:25:46.462,000 --> 0:25:52,000
When atheists like Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein use the word "God,"

447
0:25:53,000 --> 0:25:56,000
they use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand

448
0:25:56.737,000 --> 0:26:,000
for that deep, mysterious part of physics which we don't yet understand.

449
0:26:02.221,000 --> 0:26:07,000
"Non-theist" will do for all that, yet unlike "atheist,"

450
0:26:07.261,000 --> 0:26:13,000
it doesn't have the same phobic, hysterical responses.

451
0:26:14.558,000 --> 0:26:15,000
But I think, actually, the alternative

452
0:26:16.436,000 --> 0:26:18,000
is to grasp the nettle of the word "atheism" itself,

453
0:26:19.309,000 --> 0:26:21,000
precisely because it is a taboo word,

454
0:26:22,000 --> 0:26:25,000
carrying frissons of hysterical phobia.

455
0:26:26.214,000 --> 0:26:29,000
Critical mass may be harder to achieve with the word "atheist"

456
0:26:29.67,000 --> 0:26:3,000
than with the word "non-theist,"

457
0:26:31.249,000 --> 0:26:32,000
or some other non-confrontational word.

458
0:26:33.685,000 --> 0:26:36,000
But if we did achieve it with that dread word "atheist" itself,

459
0:26:37.471,000 --> 0:26:39,000
the political impact would be even greater.

460
0:26:41.343,000 --> 0:26:44,000
Now, I said that if I were religious, I'd be very afraid of evolution --

461
0:26:44.772,000 --> 0:26:47,000
I'd go further: I would fear science in general, if properly understood.

462
0:26:48.43,000 --> 0:26:51,000
And this is because the scientific worldview

463
0:26:51.667,000 --> 0:26:54,000
is so much more exciting, more poetic,

464
0:26:54.756,000 --> 0:26:56,000
more filled with sheer wonder

465
0:26:57.257,000 --> 0:27:02,000
than anything in the poverty-stricken arsenals of the religious imagination.

466
0:27:04.237,000 --> 0:27:08,000
As Carl Sagan, another recently dead hero, put it,

467
0:27:09,000 --> 0:27:13,000
"How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science

468
0:27:13.59,000 --> 0:27:17,000
and concluded, 'This is better than we thought!

469
0:27:17.909,000 --> 0:27:19,000
The universe is much bigger than our prophet said,

470
0:27:20.405,000 --> 0:27:23,000
grander, more subtle, more elegant'?

471
0:27:23.636,000 --> 0:27:25,000
Instead they say, 'No, no, no!

472
0:27:26,000 --> 0:27:29,000
My god is a little god, and I want him to stay that way.'

473
0:27:31.179,000 --> 0:27:33,000
A religion, old or new,

474
0:27:33.333,000 --> 0:27:35,000
that stressed the magnificence of the universe

475
0:27:36,000 --> 0:27:37,000
as revealed by modern science,

476
0:27:38,000 --> 0:27:41,000
might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe

477
0:27:41.688,000 --> 0:27:43,000
hardly tapped by the conventional faiths."

478
0:27:46.22,000 --> 0:27:49,000
Now, this is an elite audience,

479
0:27:49.38,000 --> 0:27:53,000
and I would therefore expect about 10 percent of you to be religious.

480
0:27:55.904,000 --> 0:27:59,000
Many of you probably subscribe to our polite cultural belief

481
0:28:00.407,000 --> 0:28:02,000
that we should respect religion.

482
0:28:03.303,000 --> 0:28:06,000
But I also suspect that a fair number of those

483
0:28:07,000 --> 0:28:1,000
secretly despise religion as much as I do.

484
0:28:10.769,000 --> 0:28:11,000
(Laughter)

485
0:28:12.052,000 --> 0:28:14,000
If you're one of them, and of course many of you may not be,

486
0:28:14.929,000 --> 0:28:15,000
but if you are one of them,

487
0:28:16.261,000 --> 0:28:18,000
I'm asking you to stop being polite,

488
0:28:18.353,000 --> 0:28:19,000
come out, and say so.

489
0:28:21.113,000 --> 0:28:22,000
And if you happen to be rich,

490
0:28:23.136,000 --> 0:28:26,000
give some thought to ways in which you might make a difference.

491
0:28:27.369,000 --> 0:28:29,000
The religious lobby in this country

492
0:28:29.763,000 --> 0:28:34,000
is massively financed by foundations -- to say nothing of all the tax benefits --

493
0:28:35.317,000 --> 0:28:39,000
by foundations, such as the Templeton Foundation and the Discovery Institute.

494
0:28:40.515,000 --> 0:28:43,000
We need an anti-Templeton to step forward.

495
0:28:45.793,000 --> 0:28:48,000
If my books sold as well as Stephen Hawking's books,

496
0:28:49,000 --> 0:28:52,000
instead of only as well as Richard Dawkins' books, I'd do it myself.

497
0:28:56.454,000 --> 0:29:02,000
People are always going on about, "How did September the 11th change you?"

498
0:29:03.871,000 --> 0:29:04,000
Well, here's how it changed me.

499
0:29:06.469,000 --> 0:29:09,000
Let's all stop being so damned respectful.

500
0:29:11.38,000 --> 0:29:12,000
Thank you very much.

501
0:29:13,000 --> 0:29:18,000
(Applause)

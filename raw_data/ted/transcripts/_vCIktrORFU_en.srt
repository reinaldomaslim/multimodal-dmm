1
0:00:14.135,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Big boys don't cry.

2
0:00:17.217,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Suck it up.

3
0:00:19.558,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Shut up and rub some dirt on it.

4
0:00:22.462,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Stop crying before I give you something to cry about.

5
0:00:26.258,000 --> 0:00:27,000
These are just a few of the phrases

6
0:00:28.14,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that contribute to a disease in our society,

7
0:00:31.338,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and more specifically, in our men.

8
0:00:34.595,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It's a disease that has come to be known as "toxic masculinity."

9
0:00:40.044,000 --> 0:00:42,000
It's one I suffered a chronic case of,

10
0:00:42.615,000 --> 0:00:46,000
so much so that I spent 24 years of a life sentence in prison

11
0:00:47.298,000 --> 0:00:5,000
for kidnapping, robbery, and attempted murder.

12
0:00:52.298,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Yet I'm here to tell you today that there's a solution for this epidemic.

13
0:00:57.494,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I know for a fact the solution works, because I was a part of human trials.

14
0:01:03.239,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The solution is a mixture of elements.

15
0:01:06.496,000 --> 0:01:09,000
It begins with the willingness to look at your belief system

16
0:01:10.187,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and how out of alignment it is

17
0:01:12.461,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and how your actions negatively impact not just yourself,

18
0:01:15.776,000 --> 0:01:16,000
but the people around you.

19
0:01:18.349,000 --> 0:01:22,000
The next ingredient is the willingness to be vulnerable with people

20
0:01:23.522,000 --> 0:01:26,000
who would not just support you, but hold you accountable.

21
0:01:28.839,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But before I tell you about this,

22
0:01:30.505,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I need to let you know that in order to share this,

23
0:01:34.846,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I have to bare my soul in full.

24
0:01:38.267,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And as I stand here,

25
0:01:40.338,000 --> 0:01:41,000
with so many eyes fixed on me,

26
0:01:43.238,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I feel raw and naked.

27
0:01:48.046,000 --> 0:01:49,000
When this feeling is present,

28
0:01:49.714,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I'm confident that the next phase of healing is on the horizon,

29
0:01:55.422,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and that allows me to share my story in full.

30
0:01:59.362,000 --> 0:02:03,000
For all appearances' sake, I was born into the ideal family dynamic:

31
0:02:04.805,000 --> 0:02:06,000
mother, father, sister, brother.

32
0:02:07.671,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Bertha, Eldra Jr., Taydama and Eldra III.

33
0:02:12.647,000 --> 0:02:13,000
That's me.

34
0:02:14.978,000 --> 0:02:17,000
My father was a Vietnam veteran who earned a Purple Heart

35
0:02:18.011,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and made it home to find love, marry, and begin his own brood.

36
0:02:23.273,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So how did I wind up serving life in the California prison system?

37
0:02:28.066,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Keeping secrets,

38
0:02:30.527,000 --> 0:02:32,000
believing the mantra that big boys don't cry,

39
0:02:34.594,000 --> 0:02:38,000
not knowing how to display any emotion confidently other than anger,

40
0:02:41.199,000 --> 0:02:42,000
participating in athletics

41
0:02:42.699,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and learning that the greater the performance on the field,

42
0:02:45.576,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the less the need to worry about the rules off it.

43
0:02:48.486,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It's hard to pin down any one specific ingredient

44
0:02:51.336,000 --> 0:02:53,000
of the many symptoms that ailed me.

45
0:02:55.613,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Growing up as a young black male in Sacramento, California in the 1980s,

46
0:02:59.739,000 --> 0:03:01,000
there were two groups I identified as having respect:

47
0:03:03.555,000 --> 0:03:05,000
athletes and gangsters.

48
0:03:07.463,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I excelled in sports,

49
0:03:10.21,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that is until a friend and I chose to take his mom's car for a joyride and wreck it.

50
0:03:16.502,000 --> 0:03:19,000
With my parents having to split the cost of a totaled vehicle,

51
0:03:20.555,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I was relegated to a summer of household chores and no sports.

52
0:03:26.873,000 --> 0:03:28,000
No sports meant no respect.

53
0:03:30.592,000 --> 0:03:32,000
No respect equaled no power.

54
0:03:34.103,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Power was vital to feed my illness.

55
0:03:38.129,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It was at that point the decision to transition from athlete to gangster

56
0:03:44.376,000 --> 0:03:46,000
was made and done so easily.

57
0:03:48.199,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Early life experiences had set the stage for me to be well-suited

58
0:03:54.08,000 --> 0:03:55,000
to objectify others,

59
0:03:57.635,000 --> 0:03:59,000
act in a socially detached manner,

60
0:03:59.982,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and above all else, seek to be viewed as in a position of power.

61
0:04:05.721,000 --> 0:04:06,000
A sense of power

62
0:04:07.499,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Sighs)

63
0:04:11.331,000 --> 0:04:13,000
equaled strength in my environment,

64
0:04:13.856,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but more importantly, it did so in my mind.

65
0:04:16.916,000 --> 0:04:17,000
My mind dictated my choices.

66
0:04:20.138,000 --> 0:04:23,000
My subsequent choices put me on the fast track to prison life.

67
0:04:25.278,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And even once in prison, I continued my history

68
0:04:28.096,000 --> 0:04:3,000
of running over the rights of others,

69
0:04:32.22,000 --> 0:04:35,000
even knowing that that was the place that I would die.

70
0:04:35.564,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Once again, I wound up in solitary confinement

71
0:04:39.748,000 --> 0:04:41,000
for stabbing another prisoner nearly 30 times.

72
0:04:44.403,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I'd gotten to a place where I didn't care how I lived or if I died.

73
0:04:49.946,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But then, things changed.

74
0:04:52.34,000 --> 0:04:54,000
One of the best things that happened in my life to that point

75
0:04:55.222,000 --> 0:04:56,000
was being sent to New Folsom Prison.

76
0:04:57.789,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Once there, I was approached to join a group called Inside Circle.

77
0:05:03.693,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Initially, I was hesitant to join a group referred to around the yard

78
0:05:07.686,000 --> 0:05:08,000
as "hug-a-thug."

79
0:05:09.499,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Laughter)

80
0:05:12.759,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Initially, yeah, that was a little much,

81
0:05:17.495,000 --> 0:05:19,000
but eventually, I overcame my hesitancy.

82
0:05:20.803,000 --> 0:05:25,000
As it turned out, the circle was the vision of a man named Patrick Nolan,

83
0:05:26.534,000 --> 0:05:27,000
who was also serving life

84
0:05:28.492,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and who had grown sick and tired of being sick and tired

85
0:05:32.862,000 --> 0:05:33,000
of watching us kill one another

86
0:05:35.598,000 --> 0:05:36,000
over skin color,

87
0:05:37.931,000 --> 0:05:38,000
rag color,

88
0:05:40.87,000 --> 0:05:42,000
being from Northern or Southern California,

89
0:05:44.878,000 --> 0:05:47,000
or just plain breathing in the wrong direction on a windy day.

90
0:05:49.416,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Circle time is men sitting with men

91
0:05:52.169,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and cutting through the bullshit,

92
0:05:55.287,000 --> 0:05:57,000
challenging structural ways of thinking.

93
0:05:58.346,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I think the way that I think

94
0:06:00.204,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and I act the way that I act

95
0:06:02.874,000 --> 0:06:03,000
because I hadn't questioned that.

96
0:06:06.104,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Like, who said I should see a woman walking down the street,

97
0:06:10.555,000 --> 0:06:11,000
turn around and check out her backside?

98
0:06:13.531,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Where did that come from?

99
0:06:15.864,000 --> 0:06:18,000
If I don't question that, I'll just go along with the crowd.

100
0:06:21.706,000 --> 0:06:22,000
The locker-room talk.

101
0:06:23.896,000 --> 0:06:25,000
In circle, we sit and we question these things.

102
0:06:26.873,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Why do I think the way that I think?

103
0:06:28.765,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Why do I act the way that I act?

104
0:06:31.087,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Because when I get down to it, I'm not thinking,

105
0:06:34.34,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I'm not being an individual,

106
0:06:35.934,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I'm not taking responsibility for who I am

107
0:06:38.6,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and what it is I put into this world.

108
0:06:42.233,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It was in a circle session that my life took a turn.

109
0:06:45.208,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I remember being asked who I was,

110
0:06:47.589,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and I didn't have an answer,

111
0:06:49.913,000 --> 0:06:5,000
at least not one that felt honest

112
0:06:51.795,000 --> 0:06:54,000
in a room full of men who were seeking truth.

113
0:06:54.861,000 --> 0:06:55,000
It would have been easy to say,

114
0:06:56.628,000 --> 0:06:57,000
"I'm a Blood,"

115
0:06:58.364,000 --> 0:07:,000
or, "My name is Vegas,"

116
0:07:01.396,000 --> 0:07:04,000
or any number of facades I had manufactured to hide behind.

117
0:07:05.651,000 --> 0:07:09,000
It was in that moment and in that venue that the jig was up.

118
0:07:11.362,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I realized that as sharp as I believed I was,

119
0:07:13.799,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I didn't even know who I was

120
0:07:15.908,000 --> 0:07:16,000
or why I acted the way that I acted.

121
0:07:21.007,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I couldn't stand in a room full of men who were seeking to serve and support

122
0:07:25.126,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and present an authentic me.

123
0:07:29.825,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It was in that moment that I graduated to a place within

124
0:07:33.164,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that was ready for transformation.

125
0:07:36.317,000 --> 0:07:37,000
For decades,

126
0:07:38.065,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I kept being the victim of molestation at the hands of a babysitter a secret.

127
0:07:43.277,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I submitted to this under the threat of my younger sister being harmed.

128
0:07:46.976,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I was seven, she was three.

129
0:07:50.281,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I believed it was my responsibility to keep her safe.

130
0:07:56.62,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It was in that instant

131
0:07:58.81,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that the seeds were sown for a long career of hurting others,

132
0:08:03.056,000 --> 0:08:05,000
be it physical, mental or emotional.

133
0:08:07.604,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I developed, in that instant,

134
0:08:11.707,000 --> 0:08:12,000
at seven years old,

135
0:08:13.322,000 --> 0:08:14,000
the belief that going forward in life,

136
0:08:15.217,000 --> 0:08:19,000
if a situation presented itself where someone was going to get hurt,

137
0:08:19.72,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I would be the one doing the hurting.

138
0:08:22.52,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I also formulated the belief that loving put me in harm's way.

139
0:08:27.874,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I also learned that caring about another person made me weak.

140
0:08:33.376,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So not caring, that must equal strength.

141
0:08:38.11,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The greatest way to mask a shaky sense of self

142
0:08:40.879,000 --> 0:08:42,000
is to hide behind a false air of respect.

143
0:08:44.48,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Sitting in circle resembles sitting in a fire.

144
0:08:47.654,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It is a crucible that can and does break.

145
0:08:52.542,000 --> 0:08:54,000
It broke my old sense of self,

146
0:08:55.573,000 --> 0:08:58,000
diseased value system

147
0:08:58.808,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and way of looking at others.

148
0:09:02.245,000 --> 0:09:06,000
My old stale modes of thinking were invited into the open

149
0:09:06.979,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to see if this is who I wanted to be in life.

150
0:09:10.112,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I was accompanied by skilled facilitators

151
0:09:12.662,000 --> 0:09:14,000
on a journey into the depths of myself

152
0:09:15.415,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to find those wounded parts that not only festered

153
0:09:20.075,000 --> 0:09:23,000
but seeped out to create unsafe space for others.

154
0:09:25.957,000 --> 0:09:28,000
At times, it resembled an exorcism,

155
0:09:29.005,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and in essence, it was.

156
0:09:30.97,000 --> 0:09:34,000
There was an extraction of old, diseased ways of thinking,

157
0:09:35.346,000 --> 0:09:37,000
being and reacting

158
0:09:38.004,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and an infusion of purpose.

159
0:09:40.775,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Sitting in those circles saved my life.

160
0:09:44.749,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I stand here today as a testament to the fact of the power of the work.

161
0:09:53.241,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I was paroled in June 2014,

162
0:09:56.098,000 --> 0:10:,000
following my third hearing before a panel of former law-enforcement officials

163
0:10:00.186,000 --> 0:10:03,000
who were tasked with determining my current threat level to society.

164
0:10:05.079,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I stand here today for the first time since I was 14 years old

165
0:10:10.238,000 --> 0:10:12,000
not under any form of state supervision.

166
0:10:13.211,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I'm married to a tremendous woman named Holly,

167
0:10:15.474,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and together, we are raising two sons

168
0:10:17.671,000 --> 0:10:22,000
who I encourage to experience emotions in a safe way.

169
0:10:24.053,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I let them hold me when I cry.

170
0:10:26.848,000 --> 0:10:29,000
They get to witness me not have all the answers.

171
0:10:30.165,000 --> 0:10:32,000
My desire is for them to understand

172
0:10:32.434,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that being a man is not some machismo caricature,

173
0:10:36.99,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and that characteristics usually defined as weaknesses

174
0:10:41.213,000 --> 0:10:43,000
are parts of the whole healthy man.

175
0:10:44.066,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So today, I continue to work not just on myself,

176
0:10:47.232,000 --> 0:10:49,000
but in support of young males in my community.

177
0:10:51.225,000 --> 0:10:54,000
The challenge is to eradicate this cycle

178
0:10:56.986,000 --> 0:10:58,000
of emotional illiteracy and groupthink

179
0:10:59.539,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that allows our males to continue to victimize others as well as themselves.

180
0:11:05.475,000 --> 0:11:07,000
As a result of this,

181
0:11:07.647,000 --> 0:11:1,000
they develop new ways of how they want to show up in the world

182
0:11:11.621,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and how they expect this world to show up on their behalf.

183
0:11:15.303,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Thank you.

184
0:11:16.478,000 --> 0:11:2,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit,

2
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:29,000
so I'm going to dive straight in, right at the point

3
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:31,000
where I get this thing to work.

4
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Here we go. I'm going to talk about five different things.

5
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable.

6
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together,

7
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and actually talk about this a bit more than we do.

8
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course.

9
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic

10
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:46,000
about doing anything about aging.

11
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk

12
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:53,000
talking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong,

13
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:55,000
namely, by actually doing something about it.

14
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I'm going to do that in two steps.

15
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:59,000
The first one I'm going to talk about is

16
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:02,000
how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension --

17
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:05,000
which I'm going to define as 30 years, applied to people

18
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:07,000
who are already in middle-age when you start --

19
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging.

20
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Namely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between

21
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year --

22
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
or indeed, to get sick in the first place.

23
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And of course, the last thing I'm going to talk about

24
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
is how to reach that intermediate step,

25
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that point of maybe 30 years life extension.

26
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So I'm going to start with why we should.

27
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Now, I want to ask a question.

28
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Hands up: anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria?

29
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
That was easy. OK.

30
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
OK. Hands up: anyone in the audience

31
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:39,000
who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing?

32
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:41,000
OK. So we all think malaria is a bad thing.

33
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:43,000
That's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be.

34
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Now the thing is, I would like to put it to you

35
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing

36
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.

37
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And here is that characteristic.

38
0:01:55,000 --> 0:02:,000
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does.

39
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Now, I like in an audience, in Britain especially,

40
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:04,000
to talk about the comparison with foxhunting,

41
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:07,000
which is something that was banned after a long struggle,

42
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:1,000
by the government not very many months ago.

43
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I mean, I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here,

44
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
but, as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic.

45
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me.

46
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:2,000
You know, a lot of people said, "Well, you know,

47
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:25,000
city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time.

48
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It's a traditional part of the way of life,

49
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and we should be allowed to carry on doing it.

50
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It's ecologically sound; it stops the population explosion of foxes."

51
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But ultimately, the government prevailed in the end,

52
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:35,000
because the majority of the British public,

53
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and certainly the majority of members of Parliament,

54
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:39,000
came to the conclusion that it was really something

55
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that should not be tolerated in a civilized society.

56
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And I think that human aging shares

57
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:44,000
all of these characteristics in spades.

58
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:47,000
What part of this do people not understand?

59
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:49,000
It's not just about life, of course --

60
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter) --

61
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:53,000
it's about healthy life, you know --

62
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:56,000
getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun,

63
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:58,000
whether or not dying may be fun.

64
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:,000
So really, this is how I would like to describe it.

65
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:02,000
It's a global trance.

66
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:04,000
These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses

67
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that people give for aging.

68
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying

69
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that these excuses are completely valueless.

70
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:12,000
There are some good points to be made here,

71
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:15,000
things that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning

72
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:17,000
so that nothing goes too -- well, so that we minimize

73
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging.

74
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But these are completely crazy, when you actually

75
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:25,000
remember your sense of proportion.

76
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:29,000
You know, these are arguments; these are things that

77
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:31,000
would be legitimate to be concerned about.

78
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But the question is, are they so dangerous --

79
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:36,000
these risks of doing something about aging --

80
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite,

81
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:42,000
namely, leaving aging as it is?

82
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Are these so bad that they outweigh

83
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:5,000
condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death?

84
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
You know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong,

85
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:55,000
then just don't waste my time, is what I say.

86
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Laughter)

87
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Now, there is one argument

88
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that some people do think really is that strong, and here it is.

89
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:01,000
People worry about overpopulation; they say,

90
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:03,000
"Well, if we fix aging, no one's going to die to speak of,

91
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:06,000
or at least the death toll is going to be much lower,

92
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:08,000
only from crossing St. Giles carelessly.

93
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids,

94
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and kids are really important to most people."

95
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And that's true.

96
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question,

97
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and give answers like this.

98
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I don't agree with those answers. I think they basically don't work.

99
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I think it's true, that we will face a dilemma in this respect.

100
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:28,000
We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate,

101
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:3,000
or a high death rate.

102
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:33,000
A high death rate will, of course, arise from simply rejecting these therapies,

103
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids.

104
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And, I say that that's fine --

105
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:42,000
the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice.

106
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:46,000
What's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future.

107
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:48,000
If we vacillate, hesitate,

108
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and do not actually develop these therapies,

109
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:55,000
then we are condemning a whole cohort of people --

110
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:57,000
who would have been young enough and healthy enough

111
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to benefit from those therapies, but will not be,

112
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:01,000
because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could --

113
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:03,000
we'll be denying those people an indefinite life span,

114
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and I consider that that is immoral.

115
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:08,000
That's my answer to the overpopulation question.

116
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Right. So the next thing is,

117
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
now why should we get a little bit more active on this?

118
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And the fundamental answer is that

119
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:17,000
the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks.

120
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.

121
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Aging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know,

122
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:27,000
we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds,

123
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that.

124
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Like, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons

125
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:36,000
why aging is actually a good thing after all.

126
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:4,000
But of course, that only works when we have both of these components.

127
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear --

128
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and we might be in range of doing something about aging --

129
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:47,000
this becomes part of the problem.

130
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:51,000
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things.

131
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot --

132
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:57,000
evangelize, I will go so far as to say, quite a lot --

133
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:,000
in order to get people's attention, and make people realize

134
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that they are in a trance in this regard.

135
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So that's all I'm going to say about that.

136
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I'm now going to talk about feasibility.

137
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And the fundamental reason, I think, why we feel that aging is inevitable

138
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:14,000
is summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here.

139
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:15,000
A very simple definition.

140
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place,

141
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:2,000
which is to say, metabolism.

142
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:23,000
This is not a completely tautological statement;

143
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:24,000
it's a reasonable statement.

144
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars,

145
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and it also happens to us,

146
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:33,000
despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms,

147
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect.

148
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So basically, metabolism, which is defined as

149
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:4,000
basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next,

150
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:42,000
has side effects.

151
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology.

152
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:46,000
That's a fine definition. So we can put it this way:

153
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:48,000
we can say that, you know, we have this chain of events.

154
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And there are really two games in town,

155
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
according to most people, with regard to postponing aging.

156
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:57,000
They're what I'm calling here the "gerontology approach" and the "geriatrics approach."

157
0:06:57,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The geriatrician will intervene late in the day,

158
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:01,000
when pathology is becoming evident,

159
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time,

160
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and stop the accumulation of side effects

161
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:09,000
from causing the pathology quite so soon.

162
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Of course, it's a very short-term-ist strategy; it's a losing battle,

163
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:15,000
because the things that are causing the pathology

164
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:17,000
are becoming more abundant as time goes on.

165
0:07:17,000 --> 0:07:21,000
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface,

166
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:24,000
because, you know, prevention is better than cure.

167
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:27,000
But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well.

168
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:3,000
In fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work --

169
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:32,000
even cells we're not really too good on yet.

170
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We've discovered things like, for example,

171
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:37,000
RNA interference only a few years ago,

172
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work.

173
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Basically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end,

174
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:44,000
but it is not an approach whose time has come

175
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:46,000
when we're talking about intervention.

176
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So then, what do we do about that?

177
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing,

178
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:53,000
pretty ironclad, doesn't it?

179
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:55,000
But it isn't.

180
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Before I tell you why it isn't, I'm going to go a little bit

181
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:,000
into what I'm calling step two.

182
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Just suppose, as I said, that we do acquire --

183
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
let's say we do it today for the sake of argument --

184
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:1,000
the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life

185
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:13,000
on people who are already in middle age, let's say 55.

186
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I'm going to call that "robust human rejuvenation." OK.

187
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
What would that actually mean

188
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:2,000
for how long people of various ages today --

189
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:23,000
or equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive --

190
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:25,000
would actually live?

191
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
In order to answer that question -- you might think it's simple,

192
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:29,000
but it's not simple.

193
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We can't just say, "Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies,

194
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:33,000
then they'll live 30 years longer."

195
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
That's the wrong answer.

196
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress.

197
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:39,000
There are two sorts of technological progress really,

198
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:4,000
for this purpose.

199
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:43,000
There are fundamental, major breakthroughs,

200
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs.

201
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Now, they differ a great deal

202
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:52,000
in terms of the predictability of time frames.

203
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Fundamental breakthroughs:

204
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:55,000
very hard to predict how long it's going to take

205
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to make a fundamental breakthrough.

206
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:59,000
It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun,

207
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it.

208
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But after that, things were pretty steady and pretty uniform.

209
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened

210
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:13,000
in the progression of the technology of powered flight.

211
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We can think, really, that each one is sort of

212
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:2,000
beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one, if you like.

213
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The incremental advances have added up to something

214
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:26,000
which is not incremental anymore.

215
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough.

216
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And you see it in all sorts of technologies.

217
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Computers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line,

218
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:35,000
happening of course a bit later.

219
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:38,000
You can look at medical care. I mean, hygiene, vaccines, antibiotics --

220
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:4,000
you know, the same sort of time frame.

221
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So I think that actually step two, that I called a step a moment ago,

222
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:45,000
isn't a step at all.

223
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:48,000
That in fact, the people who are young enough

224
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:5,000
to benefit from these first therapies

225
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that give this moderate amount of life extension,

226
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:56,000
even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive,

227
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
will be at some sort of cusp.

228
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:02,000
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments

229
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years.

230
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:07,000
In other words, they will be staying ahead of the game.

231
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:1,000
The therapies will be improving faster than

232
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:14,000
the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us.

233
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
This is a very important point for me to get across.

234
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Because, you know, most people, when they hear

235
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:23,000
that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more,

236
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:27,000
they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades

237
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:3,000
that are so thoroughly eliminating aging

238
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more.

239
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I'm not saying that at all.

240
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:37,000
I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies

241
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:38,000
will be enough.

242
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:41,000
They'll never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things

243
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200-year-olds.

244
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on.

245
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I decided to give this a little name,

246
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:5,000
which is "longevity escape velocity."

247
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:53,000
(Laughter)

248
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Well, it seems to get the point across.

249
0:10:56,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So, these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live,

250
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:03,000
in terms of remaining life expectancy,

251
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:05,000
as measured by their health,

252
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:08,000
for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive.

253
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:1,000
If you're already 100, or even if you're 80 --

254
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and an average 80-year-old,

255
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:14,000
we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies,

256
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:16,000
because you're too close to death's door

257
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
for the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you.

258
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:21,000
You won't be able to withstand them.

259
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:23,000
But if you're only 50, then there's a chance

260
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:26,000
that you might be able to pull out of the dive and, you know --

261
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Laughter) --

262
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:3,000
eventually get through this

263
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense,

264
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
in terms of your youthfulness, both physical and mental,

265
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes.

266
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And of course, if you're a bit younger than that,

267
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:41,000
then you're never really even going

268
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:44,000
to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes.

269
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:49,000
So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150-year-old --

270
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:51,000
we don't know how old that person is today,

271
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:53,000
because we don't know how long it's going to take

272
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to get these first-generation therapies.

273
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:57,000
But irrespective of that age,

274
0:11:57,000 --> 0:12:01,000
I'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 --

275
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:04,000
subject of course, to, you know, global catastrophes --

276
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:08,000
is actually, probably, only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old.

277
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And that's quite a thought.

278
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Alright, so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk,

279
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:16,000
my last seven-and-a-half minutes, on step one;

280
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
namely, how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension

281
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:24,000
that will allow us to get to escape velocity?

282
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit.

283
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation.

284
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I'm calling it "robust mouse rejuvenation," not very imaginatively.

285
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And this is what it is.

286
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I say we're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse,

287
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:41,000
which basically means mice that live about three years on average.

288
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:44,000
We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old.

289
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them,

290
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and with those therapies, we get them to live,

291
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:5,000
on average, to their fifth birthday.

292
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So, in other words, we add two years --

293
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:54,000
we treble their remaining lifespan,

294
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:56,000
starting from the point that we started the therapies.

295
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:59,000
The question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame

296
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:02,000
until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans?

297
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Which we can now, as I've explained,

298
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:08,000
equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity.

299
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Secondly, what does it mean for the public's perception

300
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:13,000
of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things,

301
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:15,000
starting from the time we get the mice?

302
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And thirdly, the question is, what will it do

303
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:18,000
to actually how much people want it?

304
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And it seems to me that the first question

305
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:22,000
is entirely a biology question,

306
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and it's extremely hard to answer.

307
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:26,000
One has to be very speculative,

308
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation,

309
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more.

310
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I say that's nonsense.

311
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this.

312
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:4,000
We need to give our best guess as to the time frame,

313
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:43,000
in order to give people a sense of proportion

314
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:45,000
so that they can assess their priorities.

315
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:48,000
So, I say that we have a 50/50 chance

316
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:5,000
of reaching this RHR milestone,

317
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:53,000
robust human rejuvenation, within 15 years from the point

318
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:55,000
that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation.

319
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:58,000
15 years from the robust mouse.

320
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:01,000
The public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that.

321
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:03,000
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are.

322
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:05,000
So they'll probably think it's five years away.

323
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:07,000
They'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much.

324
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And finally, of course, I think it's fair to say

325
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:14,000
that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now

326
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:16,000
is the global trance I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy.

327
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
That will be history at this point,

328
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:21,000
because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans,

329
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:24,000
since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice.

330
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:28,000
So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes,

331
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and of course that has enormous implications.

332
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:33,000
So in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice,

333
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:36,000
I'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging.

334
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I'm going to use this word "damage"

335
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:42,000
to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism

336
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and that eventually cause pathology.

337
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Because the critical thing about this

338
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:48,000
is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology,

339
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:53,000
the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life, starting before we're born.

340
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:56,000
But it is not part of metabolism itself.

341
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And this turns out to be useful.

342
0:14:57,000 --> 0:15:,000
Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way.

343
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:03,000
We can say that, fundamentally, the difference between gerontology and geriatrics

344
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:05,000
is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate

345
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:07,000
at which metabolism lays down this damage.

346
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And I'm going to explain exactly what damage is

347
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:11,000
in concrete biological terms in a moment.

348
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time

349
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:16,000
by stopping the damage converting into pathology.

350
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And the reason it's a losing battle

351
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:2,000
is because the damage is continuing to accumulate.

352
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:23,000
So there's a third approach, if we look at it this way.

353
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:25,000
We can call it the "engineering approach,"

354
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and I claim that the engineering approach is within range.

355
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:31,000
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes.

356
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:33,000
It does not intervene in this process or this one.

357
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle,

358
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and it's something that we are within range of being able to do,

359
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:42,000
because it doesn't involve improving on evolution.

360
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:44,000
The engineering approach simply says,

361
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:48,000
"Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage --

362
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:52,000
not necessarily repair them completely, but repair them quite a lot,

363
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:55,000
so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold

364
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:58,000
that must exist, that causes it to be pathogenic."

365
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:,000
We know that this threshold exists,

366
0:16:,000 --> 0:16:03,000
because we don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age,

367
0:16:03,000 --> 0:16:06,000
even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born.

368
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Why do I say that we're in range? Well, this is basically it.

369
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:13,000
The point about this slide is actually the bottom.

370
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:16,000
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging,

371
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
we will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism

372
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:21,000
is important for aging in one way or another.

373
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:23,000
This list is just for illustration; it is incomplete.

374
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:26,000
The list on the right is also incomplete.

375
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
It's a list of types of pathology that are age-related,

376
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and it's just an incomplete list.

377
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:34,000
But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete --

378
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:37,000
this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage,

379
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:4,000
side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end,

380
0:16:4,000 --> 0:16:42,000
or that might cause pathology.

381
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:45,000
And there are only seven of them.

382
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:48,000
They're categories of things, of course, but there's only seven of them.

383
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Cell loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondria and so on.

384
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:58,000
First of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete.

385
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:,000
Of course one can make a biological argument.

386
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:02,000
One can say, "OK, what are we made of?"

387
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:04,000
We're made of cells and stuff between cells.

388
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:07,000
What can damage accumulate in?

389
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:09,000
The answer is: long-lived molecules,

390
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:12,000
because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage, but then the molecule is destroyed --

391
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:16,000
like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone, too.

392
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
It's got to be long-lived molecules.

393
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:21,000
So, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago

394
0:17:21,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and that is pretty good news, because it means that,

395
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:27,000
you know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years,

396
0:17:27,000 --> 0:17:29,000
so the fact that we haven't extended this list

397
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:32,000
is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done.

398
0:17:33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
However, it's better than that; we actually know how to fix them all,

399
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:38,000
in mice, in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is,

400
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:41,000
we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade.

401
0:17:41,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Some of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top.

402
0:17:45,000 --> 0:17:48,000
I haven't got time to go through them at all, but

403
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:52,000
my conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this,

404
0:17:52,000 --> 0:17:56,000
then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years,

405
0:17:56,000 --> 0:17:59,000
but we do need to get serious about it.

406
0:17:59,000 --> 0:18:,000
We do need to really start trying.

407
0:18:01,000 --> 0:18:04,000
So of course, there are some biologists in the audience,

408
0:18:04,000 --> 0:18:07,000
and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have.

409
0:18:07,000 --> 0:18:09,000
You may have been dissatisfied with this talk,

410
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:11,000
but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff.

411
0:18:11,000 --> 0:18:13,000
I've published a great deal on this;

412
0:18:13,000 --> 0:18:16,000
I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based,

413
0:18:16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
and there's quite a lot of detail there.

414
0:18:18,000 --> 0:18:2,000
The detail is what makes me confident

415
0:18:2,000 --> 0:18:22,000
of my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here.

416
0:18:22,000 --> 0:18:24,000
So if you think that I'm wrong,

417
0:18:24,000 --> 0:18:27,000
you'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong.

418
0:18:28,000 --> 0:18:31,000
And of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people

419
0:18:31,000 --> 0:18:33,000
who call themselves gerontologists because,

420
0:18:33,000 --> 0:18:37,000
as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field,

421
0:18:37,000 --> 0:18:41,000
you know, you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant

422
0:18:41,000 --> 0:18:43,000
and not really to take it seriously.

423
0:18:43,000 --> 0:18:45,000
So, you know, you've got to actually do your homework,

424
0:18:45,000 --> 0:18:46,000
in order to understand whether this is true.

425
0:18:46,000 --> 0:18:48,000
And we'll just end with a few things.

426
0:18:48,000 --> 0:18:51,000
One thing is, you know, you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session

427
0:18:51,000 --> 0:18:55,000
who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time,

428
0:18:55,000 --> 0:18:57,000
and everyone said, "Well, it's obviously impossible."

429
0:18:57,000 --> 0:18:58,000
And you know what happened.

430
0:18:58,000 --> 0:19:02,000
So, you know, this does happen.

431
0:19:02,000 --> 0:19:04,000
We have various strategies -- there's the Methuselah Mouse Prize,

432
0:19:04,000 --> 0:19:07,000
which is basically an incentive to innovate,

433
0:19:07,000 --> 0:19:1,000
and to do what you think is going to work,

434
0:19:1,000 --> 0:19:12,000
and you get money for it if you win.

435
0:19:13,000 --> 0:19:16,000
There's a proposal to actually put together an institute.

436
0:19:16,000 --> 0:19:18,000
This is what's going to take a bit of money.

437
0:19:18,000 --> 0:19:21,000
But, I mean, look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq?

438
0:19:21,000 --> 0:19:22,000
Not very long. OK.

439
0:19:22,000 --> 0:19:23,000
(Laughter)

440
0:19:23,000 --> 0:19:26,000
It's got to be philanthropic, because profits distract biotech,

441
0:19:26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
but it's basically got a 90 percent chance, I think, of succeeding in this.

442
0:19:3,000 --> 0:19:33,000
And I think we know how to do it. And I'll stop there.

443
0:19:33,000 --> 0:19:34,000
Thank you.

444
0:19:34,000 --> 0:19:39,000
(Applause)

445
0:19:39,000 --> 0:19:42,000
Chris Anderson: OK. I don't know if there's going to be any questions

446
0:19:42,000 --> 0:19:44,000
but I thought I would give people the chance.

447
0:19:44,000 --> 0:19:48,000
Audience: Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it,

448
0:19:48,000 --> 0:19:52,000
why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man?

449
0:19:52,000 --> 0:19:56,000
(Laughter)

450
0:19:56,000 --> 0:19:59,000
AG: Because I am an old man. I am actually 158.

451
0:19:59,000 --> 0:20:,000
(Laughter)

452
0:20:,000 --> 0:20:03,000
(Applause)

453
0:20:03,000 --> 0:20:07,000
Audience: Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems

454
0:20:07,000 --> 0:20:11,000
to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate.

455
0:20:11,000 --> 0:20:16,000
However, as far as I know, all the species have evolved to actually die,

456
0:20:16,000 --> 0:20:21,000
so when cells divide, the telomerase get shorter, and eventually species die.

457
0:20:21,000 --> 0:20:26,000
So, why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality,

458
0:20:26,000 --> 0:20:3,000
when it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete?

459
0:20:3,000 --> 0:20:32,000
AG: Brilliant. Thank you for asking a question

460
0:20:32,000 --> 0:20:34,000
that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer.

461
0:20:34,000 --> 0:20:37,000
I'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question,

462
0:20:37,000 --> 0:20:39,000
which I happen to agree with,

463
0:20:39,000 --> 0:20:42,000
which is that, no, aging is not a product of selection, evolution;

464
0:20:42,000 --> 0:20:44,000
[aging] is simply a product of evolutionary neglect.

465
0:20:45,000 --> 0:20:5,000
In other words, we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging;

466
0:20:5,000 --> 0:20:52,000
you need more genetic pathways, more sophistication in your genes

467
0:20:52,000 --> 0:20:54,000
in order to age more slowly,

468
0:20:54,000 --> 0:20:57,000
and that carries on being true the longer you push it out.

469
0:20:57,000 --> 0:21:02,000
So, to the extent that evolution doesn't matter,

470
0:21:02,000 --> 0:21:04,000
doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals,

471
0:21:04,000 --> 0:21:06,000
living a long time or by procreation,

472
0:21:07,000 --> 0:21:09,000
there's a certain amount of modulation of that,

473
0:21:09,000 --> 0:21:12,000
which is why different species have different lifespans,

474
0:21:12,000 --> 0:21:14,000
but that's why there are no immortal species.

475
0:21:15,000 --> 0:21:17,000
CA: The genes don't care but we do?

476
0:21:17,000 --> 0:21:18,000
AG: That's right.

477
0:21:19,000 --> 0:21:24,000
Audience: Hello. I read somewhere that in the last 20 years,

478
0:21:24,000 --> 0:21:29,000
the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years.

479
0:21:29,000 --> 0:21:32,000
If I project that, that would make me think

480
0:21:32,000 --> 0:21:36,000
that I would live until 120 if I don't crash on my motorbike.

481
0:21:37,000 --> 0:21:42,000
That means that I'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old?

482
0:21:42,000 --> 0:21:43,000
AG: If you lose a bit of weight.

483
0:21:44,000 --> 0:21:47,000
(Laughter)

484
0:21:47,000 --> 0:21:5,000
Your numbers are a bit out.

485
0:21:5,000 --> 0:21:53,000
The standard numbers are that lifespans

486
0:21:53,000 --> 0:21:56,000
have been growing at between one and two years per decade.

487
0:21:56,000 --> 0:21:59,000
So, it's not quite as good as you might think, you might hope.

488
0:22:,000 --> 0:22:02,000
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible.

489
0:22:03,000 --> 0:22:06,000
Audience: I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults

490
0:22:06,000 --> 0:22:07,000
are actually in the human embryo,

491
0:22:08,000 --> 0:22:1,000
and that the brain cells last 80 years or so.

492
0:22:1,000 --> 0:22:12,000
If that is indeed true,

493
0:22:12,000 --> 0:22:15,000
biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation?

494
0:22:15,000 --> 0:22:18,000
If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years,

495
0:22:18,000 --> 0:22:2,000
as opposed to a typical, you know, couple of months?

496
0:22:2,000 --> 0:22:22,000
AG: There are technical implications certainly.

497
0:22:22,000 --> 0:22:25,000
Basically what we need to do is replace cells

498
0:22:26,000 --> 0:22:29,000
in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate,

499
0:22:29,000 --> 0:22:32,000
especially neurons, but we don't want to replace them

500
0:22:32,000 --> 0:22:34,000
any faster than that -- or not much faster anyway,

501
0:22:34,000 --> 0:22:38,000
because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function.

502
0:22:38,000 --> 0:22:41,000
What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on

503
0:22:41,000 --> 0:22:43,000
was a little bit of an oversimplification.

504
0:22:43,000 --> 0:22:47,000
There are species that have no aging -- Hydra for example --

505
0:22:47,000 --> 0:22:49,000
but they do it by not having a nervous system --

506
0:22:49,000 --> 0:22:51,000
and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function

507
0:22:51,000 --> 0:22:53,000
on very long-lived cells.

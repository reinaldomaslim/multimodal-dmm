1
0:00:13.318,000 --> 0:00:15,000
At this very moment,

2
0:00:16.112,000 --> 0:00:18,000
with every breath we take,

3
0:00:19.035,000 --> 0:00:23,000
major delta cities across the globe are sinking,

4
0:00:23.982,000 --> 0:00:25,000
including New York, London,

5
0:00:26.698,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Tokyo, Shanghai, New Orleans,

6
0:00:30.368,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and as well as my city, Bangkok.

7
0:00:35.017,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Here is the usual version of climate change.

8
0:00:40.602,000 --> 0:00:41,000
This is mine.

9
0:00:42.594,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Nothing much,

10
0:00:43.768,000 --> 0:00:44,000
just a crocodile on the street.

11
0:00:45.636,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:47.178,000 --> 0:00:5,000
This is an urgent impact of climate change:

13
0:00:50.523,000 --> 0:00:51,000
over sinking cities.

14
0:00:54.292,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Here, you can see the urbanization of Bangkok,

15
0:00:58.373,000 --> 0:01:01,000
growing in every direction,

16
0:01:01.425,000 --> 0:01:04,000
shifting from porous, agricultural land --

17
0:01:05.894,000 --> 0:01:08,000
the land that can breathe and absorb water --

18
0:01:09.185,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to a concrete jungle.

19
0:01:13.717,000 --> 0:01:17,000
This is what parts of it look like after 30 minutes of rainfall.

20
0:01:18.733,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And every time it rains,

21
0:01:20.577,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I wish my car could turn into a boat.

22
0:01:24.721,000 --> 0:01:26,000
This land has no room for water.

23
0:01:27.789,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It has lost its absorbent capacity.

24
0:01:34.17,000 --> 0:01:37,000
The reality of Bangkok's metropolitan region

25
0:01:37.906,000 --> 0:01:42,000
is a city of 15 million people

26
0:01:43.052,000 --> 0:01:48,000
living, working and commuting on top of a shifting, muddy river delta.

27
0:01:49.883,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Bangkok is sinking more than one centimeter per year,

28
0:01:54.983,000 --> 0:02:,000
which is four times faster than the rate of predicted sea level rise.

29
0:02:02.855,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And we could be below sea level by 2030,

30
0:02:08.29,000 --> 0:02:09,000
which will be here too soon.

31
0:02:12.946,000 --> 0:02:18,000
There is no coincidence that I am here as a landscape architect.

32
0:02:19.638,000 --> 0:02:22,000
As a child, I grew up in a row house

33
0:02:23.438,000 --> 0:02:26,000
next to the busy road always filled with traffic.

34
0:02:28.602,000 --> 0:02:32,000
In front of my house, there was a concrete parking lot,

35
0:02:32.833,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and that was my playground.

36
0:02:36.19,000 --> 0:02:4,000
The only living creature I would find,

37
0:02:40.587,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and had fun with,

38
0:02:42.281,000 --> 0:02:47,000
were these sneaky little plants trying to grow through the crack

39
0:02:47.556,000 --> 0:02:48,000
of the concrete pavement.

40
0:02:49.943,000 --> 0:02:51,000
My favorite game with friends

41
0:02:52.387,000 --> 0:02:58,000
was to dig a bigger and bigger hole through this crack

42
0:02:58.819,000 --> 0:03:,000
to let this little plant creep out --

43
0:03:01.637,000 --> 0:03:03,000
sneak out more and more.

44
0:03:05.535,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And yes, landscape architecture

45
0:03:08.925,000 --> 0:03:13,000
gives me the opportunity to continue my cracking ambition --

46
0:03:14.036,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Laughter)

47
0:03:15.544,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to connect this concrete land back to nature.

48
0:03:22.053,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Before, Thais -- my people --

49
0:03:25.304,000 --> 0:03:3,000
we were adapted to the cycle of the wet and dry season,

50
0:03:31.206,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and you could call us amphibious.

51
0:03:34.944,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Laughter)

52
0:03:35.969,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We lived both on land and on water.

53
0:03:38.841,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We were adapted to both.

54
0:03:42.166,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And flooding was a happy event, when the water fertilized our land.

55
0:03:49.115,000 --> 0:03:5,000
But now, flooding means ...

56
0:03:52.493,000 --> 0:03:53,000
disaster.

57
0:03:54.654,000 --> 0:03:55,000
In 2011,

58
0:03:56.361,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Thailand was hit by the most damaging and the most expensive flood disaster

59
0:04:03.131,000 --> 0:04:04,000
in our history.

60
0:04:05.094,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Flooding has turned central Thailand into an enormous lake.

61
0:04:10.659,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Here, you can see the scale of the flood in the center of the image,

62
0:04:15.94,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to the scale of Bangkok, outlined in yellow.

63
0:04:20.401,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The water was overflowing from the north,

64
0:04:22.89,000 --> 0:04:25,000
making its way across several provinces.

65
0:04:28.681,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Millions of my people,

66
0:04:32.071,000 --> 0:04:35,000
including me and my family,

67
0:04:35.335,000 --> 0:04:37,000
were displaced and homeless.

68
0:04:39.3,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Some had to escape the city.

69
0:04:42.259,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Many were terrified of losing their home and their belongings,

70
0:04:47.223,000 --> 0:04:52,000
so they stayed back in the flood with no electricity and clean water.

71
0:04:55.392,000 --> 0:04:57,000
For me, this flood reflects clearly

72
0:04:57.993,000 --> 0:05:,000
that our modern infrastructure,

73
0:05:02.597,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and especially our notion of fighting flood with concrete,

74
0:05:07.74,000 --> 0:05:12,000
had made us so extremely vulnerable to the climate uncertainty.

75
0:05:15.758,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But in the heart of this disaster,

76
0:05:19.382,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I found my calling.

77
0:05:21.477,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I cannot just sit and wait as my city continues to sink.

78
0:05:27.171,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The city needed me,

79
0:05:29.165,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and I had the ability to fix this problem.

80
0:05:34.949,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Six years ago,

81
0:05:37.574,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I started my project.

82
0:05:39.51,000 --> 0:05:45,000
My teams and I won the design competition for Chulalongkorn Centenary Park.

83
0:05:46.81,000 --> 0:05:51,000
This was the big, bold mission of the first university in Thailand

84
0:05:52.572,000 --> 0:05:56,000
for celebrating its hundredth anniversary

85
0:05:56.621,000 --> 0:06:01,000
by giving this piece of land as a public park to our city.

86
0:06:03.493,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Having a park sounds very normal to many other cities,

87
0:06:08.864,000 --> 0:06:11,000
but not in Bangkok,

88
0:06:12.016,000 --> 0:06:17,000
which has one of the lowest public green space per capita

89
0:06:17.925,000 --> 0:06:19,000
among megacities in Asia.

90
0:06:21.833,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Our project's become the first new public park

91
0:06:26.688,000 --> 0:06:28,000
in almost 30 years.

92
0:06:29.712,000 --> 0:06:31,000
The 11-acre park --

93
0:06:32.173,000 --> 0:06:36,000
a big green crack at the heart of Bangkok --

94
0:06:36.282,000 --> 0:06:37,000
opened just last year.

95
0:06:38.95,000 --> 0:06:39,000
(Applause and cheers)

96
0:06:40.239,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Thank you.

97
0:06:41.458,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Applause)

98
0:06:45.57,000 --> 0:06:49,000
For four years, we have pushed through countless meetings

99
0:06:50.507,000 --> 0:06:53,000
to convince and never give up to convincing

100
0:06:54.095,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that this park isn't just for beautification or recreation:

101
0:06:59.731,000 --> 0:07:01,000
it must help the city deal with water,

102
0:07:02.448,000 --> 0:07:04,000
it must help the city confront climate change.

103
0:07:05.991,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And here is how it works.

104
0:07:08.488,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Bangkok is a flat city,

105
0:07:10.783,000 --> 0:07:14,000
so we harnessed the power of gravity by inclining the whole park

106
0:07:15.783,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to collect every drop of rain.

107
0:07:20.49,000 --> 0:07:23,000
The gravity force pulls down the runoff from the highest point

108
0:07:24.053,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to the lowest point.

109
0:07:26.551,000 --> 0:07:3,000
This park has three main elements that work as one system.

110
0:07:31.854,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The first -- the green roof.

111
0:07:34.594,000 --> 0:07:37,000
This is the biggest green roof in Thailand,

112
0:07:37.772,000 --> 0:07:4,000
with the rainwater tanks and museum underneath.

113
0:07:42.88,000 --> 0:07:43,000
In the dry season,

114
0:07:44.285,000 --> 0:07:49,000
the collected rain can be used to water the park for up to a month.

115
0:07:51.313,000 --> 0:07:54,000
The runoff on the green roof then falls through wetlands

116
0:07:55.646,000 --> 0:07:58,000
with the native water plants that can help filter

117
0:07:59.426,000 --> 0:08:,000
and help clean water.

118
0:08:02.223,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And at the lower end,

119
0:08:04.073,000 --> 0:08:08,000
the retention pond collects all of the water.

120
0:08:09.466,000 --> 0:08:12,000
At this pond, there are water bikes.

121
0:08:13.604,000 --> 0:08:17,000
People can pedal and help clean water.

122
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Their exercise becomes an active part of the park water system.

123
0:08:25.698,000 --> 0:08:26,000
When life gives you a flood,

124
0:08:27.643,000 --> 0:08:28,000
you have fun with the water.

125
0:08:29.544,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Laughter)

126
0:08:32.608,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Centenary Park gives room for people and room for water,

127
0:08:36.974,000 --> 0:08:39,000
which is exactly what we and our cities need.

128
0:08:43.114,000 --> 0:08:46,000
This is an amphibious design.

129
0:08:47.466,000 --> 0:08:49,000
This park is not about getting rid of flood.

130
0:08:50.753,000 --> 0:08:53,000
It's about creating a way to live with it.

131
0:08:54.741,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And not a single drop of rain is wasted in this park.

132
0:09:00.133,000 --> 0:09:06,000
This park can hold and collect a million gallons of water.

133
0:09:08.873,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Applause)

134
0:09:10.047,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Thank you.

135
0:09:11.261,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Applause)

136
0:09:15.343,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Every given project, for me, is an opportunity

137
0:09:19.231,000 --> 0:09:23,000
to create more green cracks through this concrete jungle

138
0:09:24.441,000 --> 0:09:28,000
by using landscape architecture as a solution,

139
0:09:28.926,000 --> 0:09:33,000
like turning this concrete roof into an urban farm,

140
0:09:34.065,000 --> 0:09:36,000
which can help absorb rain;

141
0:09:37.088,000 --> 0:09:39,000
reduce urban heat island

142
0:09:39.272,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and grow food in the middle of the city;

143
0:09:43.112,000 --> 0:09:46,000
reuse the abandoned concrete structure

144
0:09:46.708,000 --> 0:09:49,000
to become a green pedestrian bridge;

145
0:09:50.923,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and another flood-proof park at Thammasat University,

146
0:09:55.964,000 --> 0:10:,000
which nearly completes the biggest green roof on an academic campus yet

147
0:10:01.804,000 --> 0:10:02,000
in Southeast Asia.

148
0:10:06.807,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Severe flooding is our new normal,

149
0:10:11.39,000 --> 0:10:14,000
putting the southeast Asian region --

150
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
the region with the most coastline --

151
0:10:18.641,000 --> 0:10:19,000
at extreme risk.

152
0:10:22.039,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Creating a park is just one solution.

153
0:10:26.685,000 --> 0:10:27,000
The awareness of climate change

154
0:10:28.343,000 --> 0:10:34,000
means we, in every profession we are involved,

155
0:10:34.579,000 --> 0:10:39,000
are increasingly obligated to understand the climate risk

156
0:10:39.614,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and put whatever we are working on as part of the solution.

157
0:10:46.386,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Because if our cities continue

158
0:10:50.926,000 --> 0:10:51,000
the way they are now,

159
0:10:53.854,000 --> 0:10:56,000
a similar catastrophe will happen again ...

160
0:10:57.964,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and again.

161
0:11:01.531,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Creating a solution in these sinking cities

162
0:11:04.803,000 --> 0:11:09,000
is like making the impossible possible.

163
0:11:11.909,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And for that,

164
0:11:14.07,000 --> 0:11:19,000
I would like to share one word that I always keep in mind,

165
0:11:19.662,000 --> 0:11:21,000
that is, "tangjai."

166
0:11:23.968,000 --> 0:11:29,000
The literal translation for "tang" is "to firmly stand,"

167
0:11:31.942,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and "jai" means "heart."

168
0:11:36.723,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Firmly stand your heart at your goal.

169
0:11:41.325,000 --> 0:11:45,000
In Thai language, when you commit to do something,

170
0:11:45.963,000 --> 0:11:48,000
you put tangjai in front of your word,

171
0:11:49.12,000 --> 0:11:52,000
so your heart will be in your action.

172
0:11:54.023,000 --> 0:11:56,000
No matter how rough the path,

173
0:11:56.247,000 --> 0:11:57,000
how big the crack,

174
0:11:58.254,000 --> 0:11:59,000
you push through to your goal,

175
0:12:00.143,000 --> 0:12:02,000
because that's where your heart is.

176
0:12:04.72,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And yes, Thailand is home.

177
0:12:10.107,000 --> 0:12:12,000
This land is my only home,

178
0:12:13.648,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and that's where I firmly stand my heart.

179
0:12:19.637,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Where do you stand yours?

180
0:12:21.954,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Thank you.

181
0:12:23.129,000 --> 0:12:24,000
(Applause)

182
0:12:24.17,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Thank you.

183
0:12:25.345,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Kòp kun ka.

184
0:12:26.52,000 --> 0:12:29,000
(Applause and cheers)

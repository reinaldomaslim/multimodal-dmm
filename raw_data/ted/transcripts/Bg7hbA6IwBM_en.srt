1
0:00:12.792,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I was eight years old.

2
0:00:15.292,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I remember that day clearly

3
0:00:17.458,000 --> 0:00:19,000
like it happened just yesterday.

4
0:00:20.542,000 --> 0:00:22,000
My mother is a bidi roller.

5
0:00:23.375,000 --> 0:00:26,000
She hand-rolls country cigarettes to sustain our family.

6
0:00:27.75,000 --> 0:00:28,000
She is a hard worker

7
0:00:29.583,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and spent 10 to 12 hours every day rolling bidis.

8
0:00:34.5,000 --> 0:00:39,000
That particular day she came home and showed me her bidi-rolling wage book.

9
0:00:39.625,000 --> 0:00:42,000
She asked me how much money she has earned that week.

10
0:00:44.333,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I went through that book,

11
0:00:45.917,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and what caught my eyes were her thumbprints on each page.

12
0:00:51.75,000 --> 0:00:53,000
My mother has never been to school.

13
0:00:54.875,000 --> 0:00:57,000
She uses her thumbprints instead of a signature

14
0:00:58.417,000 --> 0:00:59,000
to keep a record of her earnings.

15
0:01:01.292,000 --> 0:01:03,000
On that day, for some reason,

16
0:01:03.792,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I wanted to teach her how to hold a pen and write her name.

17
0:01:08.25,000 --> 0:01:1,000
She was reluctant at first.

18
0:01:10.292,000 --> 0:01:12,000
She smiled innocently and said no.

19
0:01:13.875,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But deep down, I was sure she wanted to give it a try.

20
0:01:18.208,000 --> 0:01:21,000
With a little bit of perseverance and a lot of effort,

21
0:01:21.458,000 --> 0:01:22,000
we managed to write her name.

22
0:01:23.292,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Her hands were trembling, and her face was beaming with pride.

23
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:3,000
As I watched her do this,

24
0:01:30.917,000 --> 0:01:32,000
for the first time in my life,

25
0:01:33.542,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I had a priceless feeling:

26
0:01:36.667,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that I could be of some use to this world.

27
0:01:42.042,000 --> 0:01:44,000
That feeling was very special,

28
0:01:44.583,000 --> 0:01:46,000
because I am not meant to be useful.

29
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
In rural India, girls are generally considered worthless.

30
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:54,000
They're a liability or a burden.

31
0:01:54.625,000 --> 0:01:55,000
If they are considered useful,

32
0:01:56.625,000 --> 0:01:59,000
it is only to cook dishes, keep the house clean

33
0:01:59.917,000 --> 0:02:,000
or raise children.

34
0:02:02.208,000 --> 0:02:05,000
As a second daughter of my conservative Indian family,

35
0:02:05.708,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I was fairly clear from a very early age

36
0:02:09.083,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that no one expected anything from me.

37
0:02:13.25,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I was conditioned to believe that the three identities that defined me --

38
0:02:18.083,000 --> 0:02:2,000
poor village girl --

39
0:02:20.875,000 --> 0:02:24,000
meant that I was to live a life of no voice and no choice.

40
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:3,000
These three identities forced me to think

41
0:02:30.917,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that I should never have been born.

42
0:02:35.708,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Yet, I was.

43
0:02:39.208,000 --> 0:02:43,000
All throughout my childhood, as I rolled bidis alongside my mother,

44
0:02:43.458,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I would wonder:

45
0:02:45.542,000 --> 0:02:46,000
What did my future hold?

46
0:02:48.333,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I often asked my mother, with a lot of anxiety,

47
0:02:51.917,000 --> 0:02:53,000
"Amma, will my life be different from yours?

48
0:02:55.583,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Will I have a chance to choose my life?

49
0:02:59.125,000 --> 0:03:,000
Will I go to college?"

50
0:03:01.958,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And she would reply back,

51
0:03:05.333,000 --> 0:03:06,000
"Try to finish high school first."

52
0:03:08.458,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I am sure my mother did not mean to discourage me.

53
0:03:12.083,000 --> 0:03:14,000
She only wanted me to understand

54
0:03:14.583,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that my dreams might be too big for a girl in my village.

55
0:03:20.458,000 --> 0:03:23,000
When I was 13, I found the autobiography of Helen Keller.

56
0:03:25.417,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Helen became my inspiration.

57
0:03:27.583,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I admired her indomitable spirit.

58
0:03:30.458,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I wanted to have a college degree like her,

59
0:03:33.083,000 --> 0:03:37,000
so I fought with my father and my relatives to be sent to college,

60
0:03:37.417,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and it worked.

61
0:03:40.875,000 --> 0:03:42,000
During my final year of my undergraduate degree,

62
0:03:43.5,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I desperately wanted to escape from being forced into marriage,

63
0:03:47.875,000 --> 0:03:49,000
so I applied to a fellowship program in Delhi,

64
0:03:50.333,000 --> 0:03:53,000
which is about 1,600 miles away from my village.

65
0:03:53.792,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:57.333,000 --> 0:04:01,000
In fact, I recall that the only way I could fill out the application

67
0:04:02.167,000 --> 0:04:04,000
was during my commute to college.

68
0:04:05.208,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I did not have access to computers,

69
0:04:07.75,000 --> 0:04:1,000
so I had to borrow a college junior's cell phone.

70
0:04:11.375,000 --> 0:04:14,000
As a woman, I could not be seen with a cell phone,

71
0:04:14.833,000 --> 0:04:16,000
so I used to huddle his phone under my shawl

72
0:04:17.75,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and type as slowly as possible

73
0:04:20.667,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to ensure that I would not be heard.

74
0:04:25.167,000 --> 0:04:26,000
After many rounds of interviews,

75
0:04:27.042,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I got into the fellowship program with a full scholarship.

76
0:04:30.875,000 --> 0:04:33,000
My father was confused, my mother was worried --

77
0:04:34.708,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Applause)

78
0:04:39.25,000 --> 0:04:41,000
My father was confused, my mother was worried,

79
0:04:42.208,000 --> 0:04:44,000
but I felt butterflies in my stomach

80
0:04:44.958,000 --> 0:04:47,000
because I was going to step out of my village

81
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:49,000
for the first time

82
0:04:49.333,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to study in the national capital.

83
0:04:53.292,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Of the 97 fellows selected that year,

84
0:04:55.833,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I was the only rural college graduate.

85
0:04:59.292,000 --> 0:05:01,000
There was no one there who looked like me or spoke like me.

86
0:05:03.25,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I felt alienated, intimidated and judged by many.

87
0:05:08.375,000 --> 0:05:1,000
One fellow called me "Coconut Girl."

88
0:05:11.875,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Can you guess why?

89
0:05:13.917,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Anyone?

90
0:05:16.167,000 --> 0:05:2,000
That's because I applied a lot of coconut oil to my hair.

91
0:05:20.292,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Laughter)

92
0:05:22.625,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Another asked me where I had learned to speak English,

93
0:05:26.333,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and some of my peers did not prefer to have me on their assignment teams

94
0:05:30.875,000 --> 0:05:34,000
because they thought I would not be able to contribute to their discussion.

95
0:05:35.458,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I felt that many of my peers believed that a person from rural India

96
0:05:40.833,000 --> 0:05:42,000
could not supply anything of value,

97
0:05:43.125,000 --> 0:05:46,000
yet the majority of Indian population today is rural.

98
0:05:48.292,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I realized that stories like mine were considered to be an exception

99
0:05:53.5,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and never the expectation.

100
0:05:57.583,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I believe that all of us are born into a reality that we blindly accept

101
0:06:02.583,000 --> 0:06:05,000
until something awakens us and a new world opens up.

102
0:06:07.292,000 --> 0:06:12,000
When I saw my mother's first signature on her bidi-rolling wage book,

103
0:06:12.792,000 --> 0:06:14,000
when I felt the hot Delhi air against my face

104
0:06:15.75,000 --> 0:06:17,000
after a 50-hour train journey,

105
0:06:18.667,000 --> 0:06:21,000
when I finally felt free and let myself be,

106
0:06:22.208,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I saw a glimpse of that new world I longed for,

107
0:06:25.542,000 --> 0:06:29,000
a world where a girl like me is no longer a liability or a burden

108
0:06:29.75,000 --> 0:06:31,000
but a person of use, a person of value

109
0:06:32.417,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and a person of worthiness.

110
0:06:35.583,000 --> 0:06:38,000
By the time my fellowship ended, my life had changed.

111
0:06:39.25,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Not only had I traced my lost voice,

112
0:06:41.75,000 --> 0:06:44,000
but also had a choice to make myself useful.

113
0:06:46.417,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I was 22.

114
0:06:48.125,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I came back to my village to set up the Bodhi Tree Foundation,

115
0:06:51.708,000 --> 0:06:54,000
an institution that supports rural youth

116
0:06:54.833,000 --> 0:06:57,000
by providing them with education, life skills and opportunities.

117
0:06:59.542,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We work closely with our rural youth

118
0:07:01.583,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to change their life and to benefit our communities.

119
0:07:06.333,000 --> 0:07:08,000
How do I know my institution is working?

120
0:07:09.417,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Well, six months ago, we had a new joinee.

121
0:07:12.792,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Her name is Kaviarasi.

122
0:07:14.917,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I first spotted her in a local college in Tirunelveli

123
0:07:18.417,000 --> 0:07:2,000
during one of my training sessions.

124
0:07:20.708,000 --> 0:07:23,000
As you can see, she has a smile which you can never forget.

125
0:07:25.958,000 --> 0:07:29,000
We guided her to get an opportunity to study at Ashoka University, Delhi.

126
0:07:30.792,000 --> 0:07:35,000
The best part of her story is that she is now back at Bodhi Tree as a trainer

127
0:07:36.542,000 --> 0:07:41,000
working with dedication to make a change in the lives of others like her.

128
0:07:41.667,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Kaviarasi doesn't want to feel like an exception.

129
0:07:44.667,000 --> 0:07:47,000
She wants to be of use to others in this world.

130
0:07:49.417,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Recently, Kaviarasi mentored Anitha,

131
0:07:52.583,000 --> 0:07:54,000
who also comes from a remote, rural village,

132
0:07:54.833,000 --> 0:07:56,000
lives in a 10-foot-by-10-foot home,

133
0:07:56.917,000 --> 0:07:58,000
her parents are also farm laborers.

134
0:07:59.667,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Kaviarasi helped Anitha secure admission in a prestigious undergraduate program

135
0:08:04.833,000 --> 0:08:06,000
in a top university in India with a full scholarship.

136
0:08:08.542,000 --> 0:08:1,000
When Anitha's parents were reluctant to send her that far,

137
0:08:11.417,000 --> 0:08:13,000
we asked the district administration officials

138
0:08:13.708,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to speak to Anitha's parents,

139
0:08:15.333,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and it worked.

140
0:08:16.625,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And then there is Padma.

141
0:08:19.708,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Padma and I went to college together.

142
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:25,000
She's the first in her entire village to attend graduation.

143
0:08:26.458,000 --> 0:08:28,000
She had been working with me at Bodhi Tree

144
0:08:29.083,000 --> 0:08:32,000
until one day she decides to go to graduate school.

145
0:08:32.542,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I asked her why.

146
0:08:34.458,000 --> 0:08:36,000
She told me that she wanted to make sure

147
0:08:36.958,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that she would never be a liability or a burden to anyone

148
0:08:40.917,000 --> 0:08:41,000
at any point in her life.

149
0:08:43.667,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Padma, Anitha and Kaviarasi

150
0:08:45.832,000 --> 0:08:47,000
grew up in the most tough families and communities

151
0:08:48.582,000 --> 0:08:49,000
one could only imagine.

152
0:08:50.917,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Yet the journey of finding my usefulness in this world

153
0:08:54.582,000 --> 0:08:57,000
served them in finding their usefulness to this world.

154
0:08:59.958,000 --> 0:09:,000
Of course there are challenges.

155
0:09:01.583,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I'm aware change does not happen overnight.

156
0:09:04.292,000 --> 0:09:08,000
A lot of my work involves working with families and communities

157
0:09:08.708,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to help them understand why getting an education

158
0:09:11.625,000 --> 0:09:12,000
is useful for everyone.

159
0:09:13.625,000 --> 0:09:15,000
The quickest way to convince them is by doing.

160
0:09:16.292,000 --> 0:09:18,000
When they see their kids getting a real education,

161
0:09:18.875,000 --> 0:09:2,000
getting a real job, they begin to change.

162
0:09:21.917,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The best example is what happened at my home.

163
0:09:26.25,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I was recently given an award in recognition of my social work

164
0:09:30.25,000 --> 0:09:32,000
by the chief minister of my state.

165
0:09:33.167,000 --> 0:09:35,000
That meant I was going to be on television.

166
0:09:35.75,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Laughter)

167
0:09:38.208,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Everyone was hooked on to the television that morning, including my parents.

168
0:09:43.625,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I would like to believe that seeing her daughter on television

169
0:09:47.333,000 --> 0:09:49,000
made my mother feel useful too.

170
0:09:50.667,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Hopefully, she will stop pressuring me to get married now.

171
0:09:54.333,000 --> 0:09:56,000
(Laughter)

172
0:09:58.542,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Finding my use has helped me to break free from the identities

173
0:10:02.542,000 --> 0:10:04,000
society thrusts on me --

174
0:10:04.917,000 --> 0:10:06,000
poor village girl.

175
0:10:08.417,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Finding my use has helped me to break free from being boxed,

176
0:10:12.375,000 --> 0:10:13,000
caged and bottled.

177
0:10:15.042,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Finding my use has helped me to find my voice,

178
0:10:18.333,000 --> 0:10:19,000
my self-worth and my freedom.

179
0:10:21.292,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I leave you with this thought:

180
0:10:22.875,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Where do you feel useful to this world?

181
0:10:25.917,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Because the answer to that question

182
0:10:27.708,000 --> 0:10:29,000
is where you will find your voice and your freedom.

183
0:10:31.25,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Thank you.

184
0:10:32.542,000 --> 0:10:37,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.897,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Sarge Salman: All the way from Los Altos Hills, California,

2
0:00:15.293,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Mr. Henry Evans.

3
0:00:17.354,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Applause)

4
0:00:32.477,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Henry Evans: Hello.

5
0:00:34.105,000 --> 0:00:35,000
My name is Henry Evans,

6
0:00:35.96,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and until August 29, 2002,

7
0:00:39.551,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I was living my version of the American dream.

8
0:00:44.575,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis.

9
0:00:49.073,000 --> 0:00:5,000
My dad was a lawyer.

10
0:00:50.928,000 --> 0:00:52,000
My mom was a homemaker.

11
0:00:53.917,000 --> 0:00:55,000
My six siblings and I were good kids,

12
0:00:56.368,000 --> 0:00:59,000
but caused our fair share of trouble.

13
0:00:59.86,000 --> 0:01:01,000
After high school, I left home to study

14
0:01:02.25,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and learn more about the world.

15
0:01:05.153,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I went to Notre Dame University

16
0:01:07.81,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and graduated with degrees in accounting and German,

17
0:01:11.356,000 --> 0:01:13,000
including spending a year of study in Austria.

18
0:01:14.3,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Later on, I earned an MBA at Stanford.

19
0:01:19.181,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I married my high school sweetheart, Jane.

20
0:01:23.193,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I am lucky to have her.

21
0:01:25.555,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Together, we raised four wonderful children.

22
0:01:30.2,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder,

23
0:01:33.281,000 --> 0:01:35,000
eventually becoming a chief financial officer

24
0:01:35.676,000 --> 0:01:39,000
in Silicon Valley, a job I really enjoyed.

25
0:01:40.476,000 --> 0:01:42,000
My family and I bought our first and only home

26
0:01:43.253,000 --> 0:01:46,000
on December 13, 2001,

27
0:01:47.089,000 --> 0:01:49,000
a fixer-upper in a beautiful spot

28
0:01:49.298,000 --> 0:01:51,000
of Los Altos Hills, California,

29
0:01:51.738,000 --> 0:01:54,000
from where I am speaking to you now.

30
0:01:54.974,000 --> 0:01:56,000
We were looking forward to rebuilding it,

31
0:01:57.584,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but eight months after we moved in,

32
0:01:59.819,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I suffered a stroke-like attack caused by a birth defect.

33
0:02:04.211,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Overnight, I became a mute quadriplegic

34
0:02:09.15,000 --> 0:02:12,000
at the ripe old age of 40.

35
0:02:12.493,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It took me several years,

36
0:02:14.646,000 --> 0:02:17,000
but with the help of an incredibly supportive family,

37
0:02:18.215,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I finally decided life was still worth living.

38
0:02:23.074,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I became fascinated with using technology

39
0:02:25.619,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to help the severely disabled.

40
0:02:30.043,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Head tracking devices sold commercially

41
0:02:32.565,000 --> 0:02:34,000
by the company Madentec

42
0:02:35.316,000 --> 0:02:38,000
convert my tiny head movements into cursor movements,

43
0:02:39.174,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and enable my use of a regular computer.

44
0:02:43.46,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I can surf the web, exchange email with people,

45
0:02:46.719,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins

46
0:02:49.647,000 --> 0:02:51,000
in online word games.

47
0:02:51.764,000 --> 0:02:53,000
This technology allows me to remain engaged,

48
0:02:54.65,000 --> 0:02:55,000
mentally active,

49
0:02:56.003,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and feel like I am a part of the world.

50
0:02:59.754,000 --> 0:03:02,000
One day, I was lying in bed watching CNN,

51
0:03:03.059,000 --> 0:03:05,000
when I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp

52
0:03:05.645,000 --> 0:03:07,000
of the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech

53
0:03:08.396,000 --> 0:03:1,000
demonstrating a PR2 robot.

54
0:03:11.24,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I emailed Charlie and Steve Cousins of Willow Garage,

55
0:03:15.287,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and we formed the Robots for Humanity project.

56
0:03:20.139,000 --> 0:03:22,000
For about two years, Robots for Humanity

57
0:03:23.04,000 --> 0:03:25,000
developed ways for me to use the PR2

58
0:03:25.421,000 --> 0:03:28,000
as my body surrogate.

59
0:03:28.801,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I shaved myself for the first time in 10 years.

60
0:03:33.894,000 --> 0:03:34,000
From my home in California,

61
0:03:35.668,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I shaved Charlie in Atlanta. (Laughter)

62
0:03:39.647,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I handed out Halloween candy.

63
0:03:44.064,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I opened my refrigerator on my own.

64
0:03:50.091,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I began doing tasks around the house.

65
0:03:54.163,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities

66
0:03:57.731,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to live and contribute,

67
0:04:00.396,000 --> 0:04:04,000
both for myself and others in my circumstance.

68
0:04:05.022,000 --> 0:04:09,000
All of us have disabilities in one form or another.

69
0:04:09.63,000 --> 0:04:14,000
For example, if either of us wants to go 60 miles an hour,

70
0:04:15.056,000 --> 0:04:2,000
both of us will need an assistive device called a car.

71
0:04:20.4,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Your disability doesn't make you any less of a person,

72
0:04:23.716,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and neither does mine.

73
0:04:26.14,000 --> 0:04:3,000
By the way, check out my sweet ride. (Laughter)

74
0:04:30.913,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Since birth, we have both suffered from the inability

75
0:04:33.81,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to fly on our own.

76
0:04:36.754,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Last year, Kaijen Hsiao of Willow Garage

77
0:04:40.864,000 --> 0:04:42,000
connected with me Chad Jenkins.

78
0:04:43.436,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Chad showed me how easy it is

79
0:04:45.909,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to purchase and fly aerial drones.

80
0:04:49.565,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It was then I realized that I could also use

81
0:04:52.153,000 --> 0:04:54,000
an aerial drone to expand the worlds

82
0:04:54.381,000 --> 0:04:57,000
of bedridden people through flight,

83
0:04:57.519,000 --> 0:04:59,000
giving a sense of movement and control

84
0:05:00.442,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that is incredible.

85
0:05:03.519,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Using a mouse cursor I control with my head,

86
0:05:06.396,000 --> 0:05:07,000
these web interfaces allow me

87
0:05:08.285,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to see video from the robot

88
0:05:09.895,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and send control commands

89
0:05:11.528,000 --> 0:05:14,000
by pressing buttons in a web browser.

90
0:05:15.255,000 --> 0:05:18,000
With a little practice, I became good enough with this interface

91
0:05:19.164,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to drive around my home on my own.

92
0:05:25.884,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I could look around our garden

93
0:05:28.592,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and see the grapes we are growing.

94
0:05:32.702,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I inspected the solar panels on our roof. (Laughter)

95
0:05:38.722,000 --> 0:05:4,000
One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone

96
0:05:41.721,000 --> 0:05:44,000
on our basketball hoop.

97
0:05:47.257,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I went even further by seeing if I could use

98
0:05:49.688,000 --> 0:05:52,000
a head-mounted display, the Oculus Rift,

99
0:05:52.711,000 --> 0:05:54,000
as modified by Fighting Walrus,

100
0:05:54.759,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to have an immersive experience

101
0:05:56.406,000 --> 0:05:59,000
controlling the drone.

102
0:06:00.361,000 --> 0:06:01,000
With Chad's group at Brown,

103
0:06:02.288,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I regularly fly drones around his lab

104
0:06:04.768,000 --> 0:06:09,000
several times a week, from my home 3,000 miles away.

105
0:06:10.517,000 --> 0:06:13,000
All work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic,

106
0:06:14.042,000 --> 0:06:17,000
so we also find time to play friendly games

107
0:06:17.072,000 --> 0:06:2,000
of robot soccer. (Laughter)

108
0:06:20.789,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I never thought I would be able to casually

109
0:06:23.179,000 --> 0:06:27,000
move around a campus like Brown on my own.

110
0:06:28.151,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I just wish I could afford the tuition. (Laughter)

111
0:06:36.505,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Chad Jenkins: Henry, all joking aside,

112
0:06:38.953,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I bet all of these people here

113
0:06:41.142,000 --> 0:06:43,000
would love to see you fly this drone

114
0:06:43.348,000 --> 0:06:46,000
from your bed in California 3,000 miles away.

115
0:06:46.513,000 --> 0:06:5,000
(Applause)

116
0:06:57.54,000 --> 0:07:,000
Okay, Henry, have you been to D.C. lately?

117
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
(Laughter)

118
0:07:04.838,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Are you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic?

119
0:07:08.347,000 --> 0:07:12,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

120
0:07:15.901,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Can you show us how excited you are?

121
0:07:18.831,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

122
0:07:23.113,000 --> 0:07:24,000
All right, big finish.

123
0:07:24.764,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Can you show us how good of a pilot you are?

124
0:07:29.818,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Applause)

125
0:07:34.468,000 --> 0:07:36,000
All right, we still have a little ways to go with that,

126
0:07:36.954,000 --> 0:07:38,000
but I think it shows the promise.

127
0:07:39.466,000 --> 0:07:41,000
What makes Henry's story amazing

128
0:07:42.102,000 --> 0:07:45,000
is it's about understanding Henry's needs,

129
0:07:45.23,000 --> 0:07:47,000
understanding what people in Henry's situation

130
0:07:48.224,000 --> 0:07:49,000
need from technology,

131
0:07:50.133,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and then also understanding

132
0:07:51.79,000 --> 0:07:53,000
what advanced technology can provide,

133
0:07:54.168,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and then bringing those two things together

134
0:07:56.241,000 --> 0:07:59,000
for use in a wise and responsible way.

135
0:07:59.483,000 --> 0:08:01,000
What we're trying to do is democratize robotics,

136
0:08:01.593,000 --> 0:08:02,000
so that anybody can be a part of this.

137
0:08:03.494,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We're providing affordable, off-the-shelf robot platforms

138
0:08:06.49,000 --> 0:08:08,000
such as the A.R. drone, 300 dollars,

139
0:08:09.03,000 --> 0:08:13,000
the Suitable Technologies beam, only 17,000 dollars,

140
0:08:13.618,000 --> 0:08:15,000
along with open-source robotics software

141
0:08:15.978,000 --> 0:08:17,000
so that you can be a part of what we're trying to do.

142
0:08:18.155,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And our hope is that, by providing these tools,

143
0:08:21.039,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that you'll be able to think of better ways

144
0:08:22.687,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to provide movement for the disabled,

145
0:08:24.588,000 --> 0:08:26,000
to provide care for our aging population,

146
0:08:27.31,000 --> 0:08:28,000
to help better educate our children,

147
0:08:29.294,000 --> 0:08:31,000
to think about what the new types

148
0:08:31.608,000 --> 0:08:33,000
of middle class jobs could be for the future,

149
0:08:34.2,000 --> 0:08:36,000
to both monitor and protect our environment,

150
0:08:36.803,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and to explore the universe.

151
0:08:38.882,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Back to you, Henry.

152
0:08:42.813,000 --> 0:08:44,000
HE: Thank you, Chad.

153
0:08:45.599,000 --> 0:08:47,000
With this drone setup, we show the potential

154
0:08:48.421,000 --> 0:08:5,000
for bedridden people to once again be able

155
0:08:50.887,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to explore the outside world,

156
0:08:53.558,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and robotics will eventually provide

157
0:08:55.935,000 --> 0:08:56,000
a level playing field

158
0:08:57.278,000 --> 0:08:59,000
where one is only limited by their mental acuity

159
0:08:59.981,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and imagination,

160
0:09:02.226,000 --> 0:09:04,000
where the disabled are able to perform

161
0:09:04.385,000 --> 0:09:06,000
the same activities as everyone else,

162
0:09:07.08,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and perhaps better,

163
0:09:09.982,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and technology will even allow us to provide

164
0:09:12.622,000 --> 0:09:14,000
an outlet for many people who are presently

165
0:09:14.783,000 --> 0:09:16,000
considered vegetables.

166
0:09:17.211,000 --> 0:09:19,000
One hundred years ago,

167
0:09:19.218,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I would have been treated like a vegetable.

168
0:09:22.569,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Actually, that's not true.

169
0:09:24.999,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I would have died.

170
0:09:27.194,000 --> 0:09:29,000
It is up to us, all of us, to decide how

171
0:09:30.016,000 --> 0:09:33,000
robotics will be used, for good or for evil,

172
0:09:33.381,000 --> 0:09:34,000
for simply replacing people

173
0:09:35.006,000 --> 0:09:36,000
or for making people better,

174
0:09:36.643,000 --> 0:09:39,000
for allowing us to do and enjoy more.

175
0:09:40.583,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Our goal for robotics is to unlock everyone's mental power

176
0:09:44.209,000 --> 0:09:46,000
by making the world more physically accessible

177
0:09:46.878,000 --> 0:09:48,000
to people such as myself and others like me

178
0:09:49.421,000 --> 0:09:51,000
around the globe.

179
0:09:51.603,000 --> 0:09:52,000
With the help of people like you,

180
0:09:53.486,000 --> 0:09:56,000
we can make this dream a reality.

181
0:09:56.626,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Thank you.

182
0:09:59.307,000 --> 0:10:05,000
(Applause)

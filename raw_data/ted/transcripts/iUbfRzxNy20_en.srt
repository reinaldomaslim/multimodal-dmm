1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I think we have to do something

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And I think it starts with one physician, and that's me.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And maybe I've been around long enough

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that I can afford to give away some of my false prestige

6
0:00:27.951,000 --> 0:00:28,000
to be able to do that.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Before I actually begin the meat of my talk,

8
0:00:31.38,000 --> 0:00:32,000
let's begin with a bit of baseball.

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Hey, why not?

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
We're near the end, we're getting close to the World Series.

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
We all love baseball, don't we?

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Baseball is filled with some amazing statistics.

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And there's hundreds of them.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
"Moneyball" is about to come out, and it's all about statistics

16
0:00:52.284,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and using statistics to build a great baseball team.

17
0:00:54.785,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I'm going to focus on one stat

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that I hope a lot of you have heard of.

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
It's called batting average.

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So we talk about a 300, a batter who bats 300.

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
That means that ballplayer batted safely, hit safely

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
three times out of 10 at bats.

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
That means hit the ball into the outfield,

24
0:01:13.284,000 --> 0:01:14,000
it dropped, it didn't get caught,

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn't get there in time

26
0:01:18.523,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and the runner was safe.

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Three times out of 10.

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Do you know what they call a 300 hitter

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
in Major League Baseball?

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Good, really good,

31
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
maybe an all-star.

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Do you know what they call

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
a 400 baseball hitter?

34
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
That's somebody who hit, by the way,

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
four times safely out of every 10.

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Legendary --

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
as in Ted Williams legendary --

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
the last Major League Baseball player

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
to hit over 400 during a regular season.

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Now let's take this back into my world of medicine

41
0:01:54.618,000 --> 0:01:55,000
where I'm a lot more comfortable,

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
or perhaps a bit less comfortable

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
after what I'm going to talk to you about.

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Suppose you have appendicitis

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and you're referred to a surgeon

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
who's batting 400 on appendectomies.

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Somehow this isn't working out, is it?

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Now suppose you live

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in a certain part of a certain remote place

51
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and you have a loved one

52
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
who has blockages in two coronary arteries

53
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist

54
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
who's batting 200 on angioplasties.

55
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But, but, you know what?

56
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
She's doing a lot better this year. She's on the comeback trail.

57
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And she's hitting a 257.

58
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Somehow this isn't working.

59
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But I'm going to ask you a question.

60
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
What do you think a batting average

61
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner

62
0:02:45.427,000 --> 0:02:46,000
or an orthopedic surgeon,

63
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
an OBGYN, a paramedic

64
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
is supposed to be?

65
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
1,000, very good.

66
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Now truth of the matter is,

67
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
nobody knows in all of medicine

68
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
what a good surgeon

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
or physician or paramedic

70
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
is supposed to bat.

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
What we do though is we send each one of them, including myself,

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
out into the world

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
with the admonition, be perfect.

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Never ever, ever make a mistake,

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
but you worry about the details, about how that's going to happen.

76
0:03:16.427,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And that was the message that I absorbed

77
0:03:18.427,000 --> 0:03:19,000
when I was in med school.

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I was an obsessive compulsive student.

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
In high school, a classmate once said

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that Brian Goldman would study for a blood test.

81
0:03:28.57,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Laughter)

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And so I did.

83
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And I studied in my little garret

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
at the nurses' residence at Toronto General Hospital,

85
0:03:37.808,000 --> 0:03:38,000
not far from here.

86
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And I memorized everything.

87
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I memorized in my anatomy class

88
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
the origins and exertions of every muscle,

89
0:03:45.284,000 --> 0:03:47,000
every branch of every artery that came off the aorta,

90
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
differential diagnoses obscure and common.

91
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I even knew the differential diagnosis

92
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
in how to classify renal tubular acidosis.

93
0:03:55.284,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And all the while,

94
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I was amassing more and more knowledge.

95
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
And I did well, I graduated with honors,

96
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
cum laude.

97
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And I came out of medical school

98
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
with the impression

99
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that if I memorized everything and knew everything,

100
0:04:10.713,000 --> 0:04:11,000
or as much as possible,

101
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
as close to everything as possible,

102
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that it would immunize me against making mistakes.

103
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And it worked

104
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
for a while,

105
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
until I met Mrs. Drucker.

106
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Toronto

107
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
when Mrs. Drucker was brought to the emergency department

108
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
of the hospital where I was working.

109
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
At the time I was assigned to the cardiology service

110
0:04:34.76,000 --> 0:04:35,000
on a cardiology rotation.

111
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And it was my job,

112
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult,

113
0:04:40.999,000 --> 0:04:42,000
to see that patient in emerg.

114
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and to report back to my attending.

115
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And I saw Mrs. Drucker, and she was breathless.

116
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And when I listened to her, she was making a wheezy sound.

117
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And when I listened to her chest with a stethoscope,

118
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I could hear crackly sounds on both sides

119
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that told me that she was in congestive heart failure.

120
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
This is a condition in which the heart fails,

121
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward,

122
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
some of the blood backs up into the lung, the lungs fill up with blood,

123
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and that's why you have shortness of breath.

124
0:05:08.38,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And that wasn't a difficult diagnosis to make.

125
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I made it and I set to work treating her.

126
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I gave her aspirin. I gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart.

127
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I gave her medications that we call diuretics, water pills,

128
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to get her to pee out the access fluid.

129
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And over the course of the next hour and a half or two,

130
0:05:25.904,000 --> 0:05:26,000
she started to feel better.

131
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And I felt really good.

132
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And that's when I made my first mistake;

133
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I sent her home.

134
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Actually, I made two more mistakes.

135
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I sent her home

136
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
without speaking to my attending.

137
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do,

138
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
which was call my attending and run the story by him

139
0:05:47.761,000 --> 0:05:49,000
so he would have a chance to see her for himself.

140
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And he knew her,

141
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
he would have been able to furnish additional information about her.

142
0:05:55.523,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Maybe I did it for a good reason.

143
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Maybe I didn't want to be a high-maintenance resident.

144
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Maybe I wanted to be so successful

145
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and so able to take responsibility

146
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
that I would do so

147
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and I would be able to take care of my attending's patients

148
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
without even having to contact him.

149
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The second mistake that I made was worse.

150
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
In sending her home,

151
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I disregarded a little voice deep down inside

152
0:06:18.427,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that was trying to tell me,

153
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
"Goldman, not a good idea. Don't do this."

154
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
In fact, so lacking in confidence was I

155
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that I actually asked the nurse

156
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
who was looking after Mrs. Drucker,

157
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
"Do you think it's okay if she goes home?"

158
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And the nurse thought about it

159
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and said very matter-of-factly, "Yeah, I think she'll do okay."

160
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I can remember that like it was yesterday.

161
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So I signed the discharge papers,

162
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and an ambulance came, paramedics came to take her home.

163
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And I went back to my work on the wards.

164
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
All the rest of that day,

165
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that afternoon,

166
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach.

167
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
But I carried on with my work.

168
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And at the end of the day, I packed up to leave the hospital

169
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and walked to the parking lot

170
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to take my car and drive home

171
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
when I did something that I don't usually do.

172
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I walked through the emergency department on my way home.

173
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And it was there that another nurse,

174
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
not the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker before, but another nurse,

175
0:07:16.856,000 --> 0:07:18,000
said three words to me

176
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that are the three words

177
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that most emergency physicians I know dread.

178
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Others in medicine dread them as well,

179
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
but there's something particular about emergency medicine

180
0:07:28.999,000 --> 0:07:31,000
because we see patients so fleetingly.

181
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
The three words are:

182
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Do you remember?

183
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
"Do you remember that patient you sent home?"

184
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
the other nurse asked matter-of-factly.

185
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
"Well she's back,"

186
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
in just that tone of voice.

187
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Well she was back all right.

188
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
She was back and near death.

189
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
About an hour after she had arrived home,

190
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
after I'd sent her home,

191
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
she collapsed and her family called 911

192
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department

193
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
where she had a blood pressure of 50,

194
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
which is in severe shock.

195
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And she was barely breathing and she was blue.

196
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops.

197
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
They gave her medications to raise her blood pressure.

198
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
They put her on a ventilator.

199
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And I was shocked

200
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and shaken to the core.

201
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And I went through this roller coaster,

202
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
because after they stabilized her,

203
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
she went to the intensive care unit,

204
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and I hoped against hope that she would recover.

205
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And over the next two or three days,

206
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
it was clear that she was never going to wake up.

207
0:08:33.618,000 --> 0:08:35,000
She had irreversible brain damage.

208
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And the family gathered.

209
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And over the course of the next eight or nine days,

210
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
they resigned themselves to what was happening.

211
0:08:43.523,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And at about the nine day mark, they let her go --

212
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Mrs. Drucker,

213
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
a wife, a mother

214
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and a grandmother.

215
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
They say you never forget the names

216
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
of those who die.

217
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And that was my first time to be acquainted with that.

218
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Over the next few weeks,

219
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I beat myself up

220
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and I experienced for the first time

221
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
the unhealthy shame that exists

222
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
in our culture of medicine --

223
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
where I felt alone, isolated,

224
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel,

225
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
because you can't talk about it with your colleagues.

226
0:09:18.808,000 --> 0:09:19,000
You know that healthy kind,

227
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal

228
0:09:23.904,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and then you get busted

229
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and then your best friend confronts you

230
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and you have terrible discussions,

231
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you

232
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and you say, I'll never make that mistake again.

233
0:09:34.57,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And you make amends and you never make that mistake again.

234
0:09:37.57,000 --> 0:09:39,000
That's the kind of shame that is a teacher.

235
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
The unhealthy shame I'm talking about

236
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
is the one that makes you so sick inside.

237
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
It's the one that says,

238
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
not that what you did was bad,

239
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
but that you are bad.

240
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And it was what I was feeling.

241
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And it wasn't because of my attending; he was a doll.

242
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
He talked to the family, and I'm quite sure that he smoothed things over

243
0:10:00.713,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and made sure that I didn't get sued.

244
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And I kept asking myself these questions.

245
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Why didn't I ask my attending? Why did I send her home?

246
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And then at my worst moments:

247
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Why did I make such a stupid mistake?

248
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Why did I go into medicine?

249
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Slowly but surely,

250
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
it lifted.

251
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I began to feel a bit better.

252
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And on a cloudy day,

253
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out

254
0:10:27.237,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and I wondered,

255
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
maybe I could feel better again.

256
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And I made myself a bargain

257
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect

258
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and never make another mistake again,

259
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
please make the voices stop.

260
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And they did.

261
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And I went back to work.

262
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And then it happened again.

263
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department

264
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
at a community hospital just north of Toronto,

265
0:10:54.475,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and I saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat.

266
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
It was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry.

267
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
He kept pointing here.

268
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I looked at his throat, it was a little bit pink.

269
0:11:03.618,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And I gave him a prescription for penicillin

270
0:11:05.738,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and sent him on his way.

271
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And even as he was walking out the door,

272
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
he was still sort of pointing to his throat.

273
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift,

274
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office.

275
0:11:18.523,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And she said the three words:

276
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Do you remember?

277
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
"Do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat?"

278
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Well it turns out, he didn't have a strep throat.

279
0:11:30.618,000 --> 0:11:32,000
He had a potentially life-threatening condition

280
0:11:32.881,000 --> 0:11:33,000
called epiglottitis.

281
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
You can Google it,

282
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
but it's an infection, not of the throat, but of the upper airway,

283
0:11:39.427,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and it can actually cause the airway to close.

284
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And fortunately he didn't die.

285
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
He was placed on intravenous antibiotics

286
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and he recovered after a few days.

287
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And I went through the same period of shame and recriminations

288
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and felt cleansed and went back to work,

289
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
until it happened again and again and again.

290
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Twice in one emergency shift, I missed appendicitis.

291
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Now that takes some doing,

292
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
especially when you work in a hospital

293
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
that at the time saw but 14 people a night.

294
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Now in both cases, I didn't send them home

295
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and I don't think there was any gap in their care.

296
0:12:19.618,000 --> 0:12:2,000
One I thought had a kidney stone.

297
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I ordered a kidney X-ray. When it turned out to be normal,

298
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
my colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient

299
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons.

300
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
The other one had a lot of diarrhea.

301
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him

302
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and asked my colleague to reassess him.

303
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And he did

304
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant, called the surgeons.

305
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
In both cases,

306
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
they had their operations and they did okay.

307
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
But each time,

308
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
they were gnawing at me, eating at me.

309
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And I'd like to be able to say to you

310
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice

311
0:12:55.713,000 --> 0:12:57,000
as many of my colleagues say, which is total B.S.

312
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
(Laughter)

313
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Some of my doozies have been in the last five years.

314
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Alone, ashamed and unsupported.

315
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Here's the problem:

316
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
If I can't come clean

317
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and talk about my mistakes,

318
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
if I can't find the still-small voice

319
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that tells me what really happened,

320
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
how can I share it with my colleagues?

321
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
How can I teach them about what I did

322
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
so that they don't do the same thing?

323
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
If I were to walk into a room --

324
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
like right now, I have no idea what you think of me.

325
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
When was the last time you heard somebody talk

326
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
about failure after failure after failure?

327
0:13:38.284,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Oh yeah, you go to a cocktail party

328
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and you might hear about some other doctor,

329
0:13:42.332,000 --> 0:13:43,000
but you're not going to hear somebody

330
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
talking about their own mistakes.

331
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
If I were to walk into a room filled with my colleages

332
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and ask for their support right now

333
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and start to tell what I've just told you right now,

334
0:13:53.713,000 --> 0:13:55,000
I probably wouldn't get through two of those stories

335
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
before they would start to get really uncomfortable,

336
0:13:58.761,000 --> 0:13:59,000
somebody would crack a joke,

337
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
they'd change the subject and we would move on.

338
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And in fact, if I knew and my colleagues knew

339
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital,

340
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
believe me, I'd have trouble

341
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
making eye contact with that person.

342
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
That's the system that we have.

343
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
It's a complete denial of mistakes.

344
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
It's a system

345
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
in which there are two kinds of physicians --

346
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
those who make mistakes

347
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and those who don't,

348
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
those who can't handle sleep deprivation and those who can,

349
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
those who have lousy outcomes

350
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and those who have great outcomes.

351
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And it's almost like an ideological reaction,

352
0:14:41.427,000 --> 0:14:44,000
like the antibodies begin to attack that person.

353
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And we have this idea

354
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
that if we drive the people who make mistakes

355
0:14:49.427,000 --> 0:14:5,000
out of medicine,

356
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
what will we be left with, but a safe system.

357
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
But there are two problems with that.

358
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
In my 20 years or so

359
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
of medical broadcasting and journalism,

360
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
I've made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors

361
0:15:06.523,000 --> 0:15:07,000
to learn everything I can,

362
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
from one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star

363
0:15:11.094,000 --> 0:15:13,000
to my show "White Coat, Black Art."

364
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And what I've learned

365
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous.

366
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
We work in a system

367
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
where errors happen every day,

368
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
where one in 10 medications

369
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
are either the wrong medication given in hospital

370
0:15:26.618,000 --> 0:15:27,000
or at the wrong dosage,

371
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
where hospital-acquired infections are getting more and more numerous,

372
0:15:31.618,000 --> 0:15:33,000
causing havoc and death.

373
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
In this country,

374
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
as many as 24,000 Canadians die

375
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
of preventable medical errors.

376
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
In the United States, the Institute of Medicine pegged it at 100,000.

377
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
In both cases, these are gross underestimates,

378
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
because we really aren't ferreting out the problem

379
0:15:49.665,000 --> 0:15:5,000
as we should.

380
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And here's the thing.

381
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
In a hospital system

382
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
where medical knowledge is doubling

383
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
every two or three years, we can't keep up with it.

384
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive.

385
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
We can't get rid of it.

386
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
We have our cognitive biases,

387
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain.

388
0:16:12.427,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Now take the same patient with chest pain,

389
0:16:14.451,000 --> 0:16:15,000
make them moist and garrulous

390
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath,

391
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and suddenly my history is laced with contempt.

392
0:16:20.523,000 --> 0:16:21,000
I don't take the same history.

393
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
I'm not a robot;

394
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
I don't do things the same way each time.

395
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
And my patients aren't cars;

396
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
they don't tell me their symptoms in the same way each time.

397
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Given all of that, mistakes are inevitable.

398
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
So if you take the system, as I was taught,

399
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and weed out all the error-prone health professionals,

400
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
well there won't be anybody left.

401
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
And you know that business

402
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
about people not wanting

403
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
to talk about their worst cases?

404
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
On my show, on "White Coat, Black Art,"

405
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
I made it a habit of saying, "Here's my worst mistake,"

406
0:16:57.904,000 --> 0:16:58,000
I would say to everybody

407
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery,

408
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
"Here's my worst mistake," blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

409
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
"What about yours?" and I would point the microphone towards them.

410
0:17:07.427,000 --> 0:17:08,000
And their pupils would dilate,

411
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
they would recoil,

412
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
then they would look down and swallow hard

413
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and start to tell me their stories.

414
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
They want to tell their stories. They want to share their stories.

415
0:17:20.426,000 --> 0:17:21,000
They want to be able to say,

416
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
"Look, don't make the same mistake I did."

417
0:17:24.283,000 --> 0:17:26,000
What they need is an environment to be able to do that.

418
0:17:26.927,000 --> 0:17:29,000
What they need is a redefined medical culture.

419
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
And it starts with one physician at a time.

420
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
The redefined physician is human,

421
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
knows she's human,

422
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
accepts it, isn't proud of making mistakes,

423
0:17:40.331,000 --> 0:17:41,000
but strives to learn one thing

424
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
from what happened

425
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
that she can teach to somebody else.

426
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
She shares her experience with others.

427
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
She's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes.

428
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
And she points out other people's mistakes,

429
0:17:53.332,000 --> 0:17:54,000
not in a gotcha way,

430
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
but in a loving, supportive way

431
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
so that everybody can benefit.

432
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
And she works in a culture of medicine

433
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
that acknowledges

434
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
that human beings run the system,

435
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
and when human beings run the system, they will make mistakes from time to time.

436
0:18:10.094,000 --> 0:18:13,000
So the system is evolving

437
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
to create backups

438
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
that make it easier to detect those mistakes

439
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
that humans inevitably make

440
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
and also fosters in a loving, supportive way

441
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
places where everybody who is observing

442
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
in the health care system

443
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes

444
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
and is rewarded for doing so,

445
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
and especially people like me, when we do make mistakes,

446
0:18:38.951,000 --> 0:18:41,000
we're rewarded for coming clean.

447
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
My name is Brian Goldman.

448
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:47,000
I am a redefined physician.

449
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
I'm human. I make mistakes.

450
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
I'm sorry about that,

451
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
but I strive to learn one thing

452
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
that I can pass on to other people.

453
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
I still don't know what you think of me,

454
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
but I can live with that.

455
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
And let me close with three words of my own:

456
0:19:05.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
I do remember.

457
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:22,000
(Applause)

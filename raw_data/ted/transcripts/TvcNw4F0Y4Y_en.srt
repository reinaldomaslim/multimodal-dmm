1
0:00:13.178,000 --> 0:00:14,000
How much do you get paid?

2
0:00:15.155,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Don't answer that out loud.

3
0:00:17.666,000 --> 0:00:18,000
But put a number in your head.

4
0:00:20.017,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Now: How much do you think the person sitting next to you gets paid?

5
0:00:25.176,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Again, don't answer out loud.

6
0:00:27.359,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:29.144,000 --> 0:00:31,000
At work, how much do you think

8
0:00:31.526,000 --> 0:00:34,000
the person sitting in the cubicle or the desk next to you gets paid?

9
0:00:35.488,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Do you know?

10
0:00:36.977,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Should you know?

11
0:00:38.961,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Notice, it's a little uncomfortable for me to even ask you those questions.

12
0:00:42.962,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But admit it -- you kind of want to know.

13
0:00:46.993,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Most of us are uncomfortable with the idea of broadcasting our salary.

14
0:00:50.542,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We're not supposed to tell our neighbors,

15
0:00:52.715,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and we're definitely not supposed to tell our office neighbors.

16
0:00:55.931,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The assumed reason is that if everybody knew what everybody got paid,

17
0:00:59.469,000 --> 0:01:,000
then all hell would break loose.

18
0:01:01.283,000 --> 0:01:03,000
There'd be arguments, there'd be fights,

19
0:01:03.408,000 --> 0:01:05,000
there might even be a few people who quit.

20
0:01:05.621,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But what if secrecy is actually the reason for all that strife?

21
0:01:09.424,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And what would happen if we removed that secrecy?

22
0:01:12.599,000 --> 0:01:15,000
What if openness actually increased the sense of fairness and collaboration

23
0:01:16.614,000 --> 0:01:17,000
inside a company?

24
0:01:17.86,000 --> 0:01:2,000
What would happen if we had total pay transparency?

25
0:01:22.254,000 --> 0:01:23,000
For the past several years,

26
0:01:23.595,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I've been studying the corporate and entrepreneurial leaders

27
0:01:26.532,000 --> 0:01:29,000
who question the conventional wisdom about how to run a company.

28
0:01:30.105,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And the question of pay keeps coming up.

29
0:01:33.105,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And the answers keep surprising.

30
0:01:36.458,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It turns out that pay transparency --

31
0:01:38.289,000 --> 0:01:4,000
sharing salaries openly across a company --

32
0:01:40.423,000 --> 0:01:42,000
makes for a better workplace for both the employee

33
0:01:43.096,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and for the organization.

34
0:01:45.362,000 --> 0:01:48,000
When people don't know how their pay compares to their peers',

35
0:01:48.485,000 --> 0:01:49,000
they're more likely to feel underpaid

36
0:01:50.325,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and maybe even discriminated against.

37
0:01:52.646,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Do you want to work at a place that tolerates the idea

38
0:01:55.245,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that you feel underpaid or discriminated against?

39
0:01:58.697,000 --> 0:02:,000
But keeping salaries secret does exactly that,

40
0:02:01.231,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and it's a practice as old as it is common,

41
0:02:04.674,000 --> 0:02:06,000
despite the fact that in the United States,

42
0:02:06.79,000 --> 0:02:09,000
the law protects an employee's right to discuss their pay.

43
0:02:11.417,000 --> 0:02:13,000
In one famous example from decades ago,

44
0:02:13.999,000 --> 0:02:15,000
the management of Vanity Fair magazine

45
0:02:16.129,000 --> 0:02:18,000
actually circulated a memo entitled:

46
0:02:18.273,000 --> 0:02:21,000
"Forbidding Discussion Among Employees of Salary Received."

47
0:02:21.502,000 --> 0:02:24,000
"Forbidding" discussion among employees of salary received.

48
0:02:25.482,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Now that memo didn't sit well with everybody.

49
0:02:27.653,000 --> 0:02:29,000
New York literary figures Dorothy Parker,

50
0:02:29.723,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Robert Benchley and Robert Sherwood,

51
0:02:31.509,000 --> 0:02:33,000
all writers in the Algonquin Round Table,

52
0:02:33.974,000 --> 0:02:34,000
decided to stand up for transparency

53
0:02:35.779,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and showed up for work the next day

54
0:02:37.535,000 --> 0:02:4,000
with their salary written on signs hanging from their neck.

55
0:02:40.773,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:42.716,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Imagine showing up for work

57
0:02:44.315,000 --> 0:02:47,000
with your salary just written across your chest for all to see.

58
0:02:49.573,000 --> 0:02:52,000
But why would a company even want to discourage salary discussions?

59
0:02:52.867,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Why do some people go along with it, while others revolt against it?

60
0:02:57.906,000 --> 0:03:,000
It turns out that in addition to the assumed reasons,

61
0:03:00.974,000 --> 0:03:03,000
pay secrecy is actually a way to save a lot of money.

62
0:03:04.301,000 --> 0:03:05,000
You see, keeping salaries secret

63
0:03:06.236,000 --> 0:03:08,000
leads to what economists call "information asymmetry."

64
0:03:09.211,000 --> 0:03:11,000
This is a situation where, in a negotiation,

65
0:03:11.506,000 --> 0:03:13,000
one party has loads more information than the other.

66
0:03:14.887,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And in hiring or promotion or annual raise discussions,

67
0:03:18.321,000 --> 0:03:21,000
an employer can use that secrecy to save a lot of money.

68
0:03:22.518,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Imagine how much better you could negotiate for a raise

69
0:03:25.166,000 --> 0:03:26,000
if you knew everybody's salary.

70
0:03:29.612,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Economists warn that information asymmetry

71
0:03:32.077,000 --> 0:03:33,000
can cause markets to go awry.

72
0:03:33.748,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Someone leaves a pay stub on the copier,

73
0:03:35.678,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and suddenly everybody is shouting at each other.

74
0:03:38.866,000 --> 0:03:39,000
In fact, they even warn

75
0:03:40.596,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that information asymmetry can lead to a total market failure.

76
0:03:46.095,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And I think we're almost there.

77
0:03:48.133,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Here's why:

78
0:03:49.323,000 --> 0:03:53,000
first, most employees have no idea how their pay compares to their peers'.

79
0:03:54.834,000 --> 0:03:57,000
In a 2015 survey of 70,000 employees,

80
0:03:58.708,000 --> 0:04:01,000
two-thirds of everyone who is paid at the market rate

81
0:04:02.113,000 --> 0:04:04,000
said that they felt they were underpaid.

82
0:04:05.036,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And of everybody who felt that they were underpaid,

83
0:04:07.939,000 --> 0:04:09,000
60 percent said that they intended to quit,

84
0:04:10.916,000 --> 0:04:12,000
regardless of where they were -- underpaid, overpaid

85
0:04:13.828,000 --> 0:04:14,000
or right at the market rate.

86
0:04:16.2,000 --> 0:04:18,000
If you were part of this survey, what would you say?

87
0:04:18.684,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Are you underpaid?

88
0:04:19.984,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Well, wait -- how do you even know,

89
0:04:22.333,000 --> 0:04:24,000
because you're not allowed to talk about it?

90
0:04:24.911,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Next, information asymmetry, pay secrecy,

91
0:04:28.534,000 --> 0:04:3,000
makes it easier to ignore the discrimination

92
0:04:31.337,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that's already present in the market today.

93
0:04:34.217,000 --> 0:04:37,000
In a 2011 report from the Institute for Women's Policy Research,

94
0:04:37.938,000 --> 0:04:39,000
the gender wage gap between men and women

95
0:04:40.086,000 --> 0:04:41,000
was 23 percent.

96
0:04:42.451,000 --> 0:04:44,000
This is where that 77 cents on the dollar comes from.

97
0:04:45.641,000 --> 0:04:46,000
But in the Federal Government,

98
0:04:47.128,000 --> 0:04:49,000
where salaries are pinned to certain levels

99
0:04:49.215,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and everybody knows what those levels are,

100
0:04:51.279,000 --> 0:04:53,000
the gender wage gap shrinks to 11 percent --

101
0:04:53.388,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and this is before controlling for any of the factors

102
0:04:55.988,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that economists argue over whether or not to control for.

103
0:04:59.264,000 --> 0:05:01,000
If we really want to close the gender wage gap,

104
0:05:01.96,000 --> 0:05:03,000
maybe we should start by opening up the payroll.

105
0:05:04.864,000 --> 0:05:07,000
If this is what total market failure looks like,

106
0:05:08.11,000 --> 0:05:11,000
then openness remains the only way to ensure fairness.

107
0:05:12.274,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now, I realize that letting people know what you make

108
0:05:14.799,000 --> 0:05:15,000
might feel uncomfortable,

109
0:05:16.469,000 --> 0:05:17,000
but isn't it less uncomfortable

110
0:05:18.008,000 --> 0:05:2,000
than always wondering if you're being discriminated against,

111
0:05:20.912,000 --> 0:05:23,000
or if your wife or your daughter or your sister is being paid unfairly?

112
0:05:25.353,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Openness remains the best way to ensure fairness,

113
0:05:29.317,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and pay transparency does that.

114
0:05:31.991,000 --> 0:05:33,000
That's why entrepreneurial leaders and corporate leaders

115
0:05:34.695,000 --> 0:05:36,000
have been experimenting with sharing salaries for years.

116
0:05:37.512,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Like Dane Atkinson.

117
0:05:38.949,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Dane is a serial entrepreneur who started many companies

118
0:05:42.852,000 --> 0:05:43,000
in a pay secrecy condition

119
0:05:44.458,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and even used that condition to pay two equally qualified people

120
0:05:47.835,000 --> 0:05:48,000
dramatically different salaries,

121
0:05:49.555,000 --> 0:05:51,000
depending on how well they could negotiate.

122
0:05:52.091,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And Dane saw the strife that happened as a result of this.

123
0:05:55.888,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So when he started his newest company, SumAll,

124
0:05:58.139,000 --> 0:06:01,000
he committed to salary transparency from the beginning.

125
0:06:01.821,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And the results have been amazing.

126
0:06:04.424,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And in study after study,

127
0:06:06.07,000 --> 0:06:07,000
when people know how they're being paid

128
0:06:07.97,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and how that pay compares to their peers',

129
0:06:10.023,000 --> 0:06:12,000
they're more likely to work hard to improve their performance,

130
0:06:12.98,000 --> 0:06:14,000
more likely to be engaged, and they're less likely to quit.

131
0:06:15.853,000 --> 0:06:16,000
That's why Dane's not alone.

132
0:06:17.279,000 --> 0:06:19,000
From technology start-ups like Buffer,

133
0:06:19.915,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to the tens of thousands of employees at Whole Foods,

134
0:06:23.285,000 --> 0:06:26,000
where not only is your salary available for everyone to see,

135
0:06:26.476,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but the performance data for the store and for your department

136
0:06:29.5,000 --> 0:06:3,000
is available on the company intranet

137
0:06:31.443,000 --> 0:06:32,000
for all to see.

138
0:06:33.985,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Now, pay transparency takes a lot of forms.

139
0:06:36.471,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It's not one size fits all.

140
0:06:38.093,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Some post their salaries for all to see.

141
0:06:40.613,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Some only keep it inside the company.

142
0:06:42.938,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Some post the formula for calculating pay,

143
0:06:45.547,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and others post the pay levels

144
0:06:47.345,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and affix everybody to that level.

145
0:06:49.147,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So you don't have to make signs

146
0:06:51.22,000 --> 0:06:53,000
for all of your employees to wear around the office.

147
0:06:53.768,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And you don't have to be the only one wearing a sign

148
0:06:56.706,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that you made at home.

149
0:06:58.494,000 --> 0:07:01,000
But we can all take greater steps towards pay transparency.

150
0:07:02.233,000 --> 0:07:04,000
For those of you that have the authority

151
0:07:04.285,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to move forward towards transparency:

152
0:07:06.103,000 --> 0:07:07,000
it's time to move forward.

153
0:07:07.943,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And for those of you that don't have that authority:

154
0:07:10.435,000 --> 0:07:11,000
it's time to stand up for your right to.

155
0:07:13.263,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So how much do you get paid?

156
0:07:16.186,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And how does that compare to the people you work with?

157
0:07:19.19,000 --> 0:07:2,000
You should know.

158
0:07:21.312,000 --> 0:07:22,000

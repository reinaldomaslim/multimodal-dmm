1
0:00:12.849,000 --> 0:00:13,000
For the past decade,

2
0:00:14.344,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I've been studying non-state armed groups:

3
0:00:17.27,000 --> 0:00:2,000
armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or militias.

4
0:00:21.588,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I document what these groups do when they're not shooting.

5
0:00:24.785,000 --> 0:00:27,000
My goal is to better understand these violent actors

6
0:00:28.372,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and to study ways to encourage transition from violent engagement

7
0:00:32.086,000 --> 0:00:33,000
to nonviolent confrontation.

8
0:00:33.987,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I work in the field, in the policy world and in the library.

9
0:00:37.749,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Understanding non-state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict,

10
0:00:42.884,000 --> 0:00:43,000
because war has changed.

11
0:00:44.464,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It used to be a contest between states.

12
0:00:47.568,000 --> 0:00:48,000
No longer.

13
0:00:48.743,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It is now a conflict between states and non-state actors.

14
0:00:53.236,000 --> 0:00:56,000
For example, of the 216 peace agreements

15
0:00:56.996,000 --> 0:00:59,000
signed between 1975 and 2011,

16
0:01:00.43,000 --> 0:01:05,000
196 of them were between a state and a non-state actor.

17
0:01:05.634,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So we need to understand these groups; we need to either engage them

18
0:01:08.895,000 --> 0:01:12,000
or defeat them in any conflict resolution process that has to be successful.

19
0:01:13.808,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So how do we do that?

20
0:01:15.805,000 --> 0:01:18,000
We need to know what makes these organizations tick.

21
0:01:19.148,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We know a lot about how they fight, why they fight,

22
0:01:21.965,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but no one looks at what they're doing when they're not fighting.

23
0:01:25.043,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Yet, armed struggle and unarmed politics are related.

24
0:01:28.659,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It is all part of the same organization.

25
0:01:30.981,000 --> 0:01:33,000
We cannot understand these groups, let alone defeat them,

26
0:01:34.162,000 --> 0:01:35,000
if we don't have the full picture.

27
0:01:37.14,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And armed groups today are complex organizations.

28
0:01:40.222,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Take the Lebanese Hezbollah,

29
0:01:42.149,000 --> 0:01:44,000
known for its violent confrontation against Israel.

30
0:01:44.956,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But since its creation in the early 1980s,

31
0:01:47.815,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Hezbollah has also set up a political party,

32
0:01:50.424,000 --> 0:01:53,000
a social-service network, and a military apparatus.

33
0:01:53.765,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Similarly, the Palestinian Hamas,

34
0:01:56.415,000 --> 0:01:58,000
known for its suicide attacks against Israel,

35
0:01:59.006,000 --> 0:02:02,000
also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007.

36
0:02:02.234,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So these groups do way more than just shoot.

37
0:02:05.453,000 --> 0:02:06,000
They multi-task.

38
0:02:07.239,000 --> 0:02:1,000
They set up complex communication machines --

39
0:02:10.278,000 --> 0:02:12,000
radio stations, TV channels,

40
0:02:12.445,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Internet websites and social media strategies.

41
0:02:15.422,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And up here, you have the ISIS magazine,

42
0:02:17.738,000 --> 0:02:2,000
printed in English and published to recruit.

43
0:02:21.259,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Armed groups also invest in complex fund-raising --

44
0:02:24.19,000 --> 0:02:27,000
not looting, but setting up profitable businesses;

45
0:02:28.077,000 --> 0:02:3,000
for example, construction companies.

46
0:02:30.491,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Now, these activities are keys.

47
0:02:32.398,000 --> 0:02:34,000
They allow these groups to increase their strength,

48
0:02:34.842,000 --> 0:02:35,000
increase their funds,

49
0:02:36.221,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to better recruit and to build their brand.

50
0:02:39.537,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Armed groups also do something else:

51
0:02:41.3,000 --> 0:02:43,000
they build stronger bonds with the population

52
0:02:43.984,000 --> 0:02:45,000
by investing in social services.

53
0:02:46.457,000 --> 0:02:48,000
They build schools, they run hospitals,

54
0:02:49.324,000 --> 0:02:52,000
they set up vocational-training programs or micro-loan programs.

55
0:02:53.104,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Hezbollah offers all of these services and more.

56
0:02:56.905,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Armed groups also seek to win the population over

57
0:02:59.738,000 --> 0:03:02,000
by offering something that the state is not providing:

58
0:03:03.662,000 --> 0:03:05,000
safety and security.

59
0:03:06.141,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The initial rise of the Taliban in war-torn Afghanistan,

60
0:03:10.125,000 --> 0:03:12,000
or even the beginning of the ascent of ISIS,

61
0:03:13.026,000 --> 0:03:16,000
can be understood also by looking at these groups' efforts

62
0:03:16.108,000 --> 0:03:18,000
to provide security.

63
0:03:18.348,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Now, unfortunately, in these cases,

64
0:03:20.643,000 --> 0:03:23,000
the provision of security came at an unbearably high price

65
0:03:23.913,000 --> 0:03:24,000
for the population.

66
0:03:25.347,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But in general, providing social services fills a gap,

67
0:03:29.612,000 --> 0:03:31,000
a governance gap left by the government,

68
0:03:31.897,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and allows these groups to increase their strength

69
0:03:34.516,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and their power.

70
0:03:36.04,000 --> 0:03:4,000
For example, the 2006 electoral victory of the Palestinian Hamas

71
0:03:40.47,000 --> 0:03:43,000
cannot be understood without acknowledging the group's social work.

72
0:03:44.696,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Now, this is a really complex picture,

73
0:03:47.094,000 --> 0:03:49,000
yet in the West, when we look at armed groups,

74
0:03:49.595,000 --> 0:03:51,000
we only think of the violent side.

75
0:03:51.821,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But that's not enough to understand these groups' strength,

76
0:03:54.717,000 --> 0:03:56,000
strategy or long-term vision.

77
0:03:57.393,000 --> 0:03:58,000
These groups are hybrid.

78
0:03:58.977,000 --> 0:04:01,000
They rise because they fill a gap left by the government,

79
0:04:02.325,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and they emerge to be both armed and political,

80
0:04:05.729,000 --> 0:04:08,000
engage in violent struggle and provide governance.

81
0:04:09.431,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated,

82
0:04:13.463,000 --> 0:04:16,000
the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state.

83
0:04:16.828,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Now, what do you call a group like Hezbollah?

84
0:04:19.131,000 --> 0:04:22,000
They run part of a territory, they administer all their functions,

85
0:04:22.47,000 --> 0:04:25,000
they pick up the garbage, they run the sewage system.

86
0:04:25.628,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Is this a state? Is it a rebel group?

87
0:04:28.72,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Or maybe something else, something different and new?

88
0:04:32.081,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And what about ISIS?

89
0:04:33.786,000 --> 0:04:34,000
The lines are blurred.

90
0:04:35.08,000 --> 0:04:38,000
We live in a world of states, non-states, and in-between,

91
0:04:38.862,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and the more states are weak, like in the Middle East today,

92
0:04:42.299,000 --> 0:04:45,000
the more non-state actors step in and fill that gap.

93
0:04:45.799,000 --> 0:04:48,000
This matters for governments, because to counter these groups,

94
0:04:48.949,000 --> 0:04:51,000
they will have to invest more in non-military tools.

95
0:04:53.202,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Filling that governance gap

96
0:04:54.697,000 --> 0:04:57,000
has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.

97
0:04:58.15,000 --> 0:05:01,000
This also matters very much for peacemaking and peacebuilding.

98
0:05:01.813,000 --> 0:05:03,000
If we better understand armed groups,

99
0:05:03.868,000 --> 0:05:05,000
we will better know what incentives to offer

100
0:05:06.354,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to encourage the transition from violence to nonviolence.

101
0:05:10.487,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So in this new contest between states and non-states,

102
0:05:14.155,000 --> 0:05:16,000
military power can win some battles,

103
0:05:16.831,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but it will not give us peace nor stability.

104
0:05:20.085,000 --> 0:05:21,000
To achieve these objectives,

105
0:05:21.957,000 --> 0:05:25,000
what we need is a long-term investment in filling that security gap,

106
0:05:26.786,000 --> 0:05:28,000
in filling that governance gap

107
0:05:28.811,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that allowed these groups to thrive in the first place.

108
0:05:32.22,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Thank you.

109
0:05:33.395,000 --> 0:05:36,000
(Applause)

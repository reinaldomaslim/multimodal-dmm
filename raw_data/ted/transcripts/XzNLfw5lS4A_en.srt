1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So yeah, I'm a newspaper cartoonist --

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
political cartoonist.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I don't know if you've heard about it -- newspapers?

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's a sort of paper-based reader.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It's lighter than an iPad,

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
it's a bit cheaper.

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
You know what they say?

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
They say the print media is dying --

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
who says that? Well, the media.

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But this is no news, right?

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
You've read about it already.

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
the world has gotten smaller.

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
I know it's a cliche, but look,

17
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
look how small,

18
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
how tiny it has gotten.

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And you know the reason why, of course.

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
This is because of technology -- yeah.

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Any computer designers in the room?

23
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Yeah well,

24
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
you guys are making my life miserable

25
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
because track pads used to be round,

26
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
a nice round shape.

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
That makes a good cartoon.

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But what are you going to do with a flat track pad,

29
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
those square things?

30
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
There's nothing I can do as a cartoonist.

31
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Well, I know the world is flat now.

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
That's true.

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And the Internet has reached

34
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
every corner of the world,

35
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the poorest, the remotest places.

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Every village in Africa now has a cyber cafe.

37
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Don't go asking for a Frappuccino there.

39
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So we are bridging the digital divide.

40
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
The Third World is connected,

41
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
we are connected.

42
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And what happens next?

43
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Well, you've got mail.

44
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Yeah.

45
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Well, the Internet has empowered us.

46
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It has empowered you,

47
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
it has empowered me

48
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and it has empowered some other guys as well.

49
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You know, these last two cartoons --

51
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I did them live

52
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
during a conference in Hanoi.

53
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And they were not used to that

54
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
in communist 2.0 Vietnam.

55
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So I was cartooning live on a wide screen --

57
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
it was quite a sensation --

58
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and then this guy came to me.

59
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
He was taking pictures of me and of my sketches,

60
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and I thought, "This is great, a Vietnamese fan."

61
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
And as he came the second day,

62
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I thought, "Wow, that's really a cartoon lover."

63
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And on the third day, I finally understood,

64
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
the guy was actually on duty.

65
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So by now, there must be a hundred pictures of me

66
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
smiling with my sketches

67
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
in the files of the Vietnamese police.

68
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
No, but it's true: the Internet has changed the world.

70
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It has rocked the music industry;

71
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
it has changed the way we consume music.

72
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
For those of you old enough to remember,

73
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
we used to have to go to the store

74
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
to steal it.

75
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And it has changed the way

77
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
your future employer

78
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
will look at your application.

79
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So be careful

80
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
with that Facebook account --

81
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
your momma told you, be careful.

82
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And technology has set us free --

83
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
this is free WiFi.

84
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But yeah, it has liberated us

85
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
from the office desk.

86
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
This is your life,

87
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
enjoy it.

88
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
In short, technology, the internet,

90
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
they have changed our lifestyle.

91
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Tech guru, like this man --

92
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that a German magazine called the philosopher of the 21st century --

93
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
they are shaping the way we do things.

94
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
They are shaping the way we consume.

95
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
They are shaping our very desires.

96
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Applause)

98
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
You will not like it.

99
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And technology has even changed

100
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
our relationship to God.

101
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Now I shouldn't get into this.

103
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Religion and political cartoons,

104
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
as you may have heard,

105
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
make a difficult couple,

106
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
ever since that day of 2005,

107
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
when a bunch of cartoonists in Denmark

108
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world --

109
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
demonstrations, fatwa,

110
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
they provoked violence. People died in the violence.

111
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
This was so sickening;

112
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
people died because of cartoons.

113
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I mean --

114
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I had the feeling at the time

115
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that cartoons had been used by both sides, actually.

116
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They were used first by a Danish newspaper,

117
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
which wanted to make a point on Islam.

118
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
A Danish cartoonist told me he was one of the 24

119
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
who received the assignment to draw the prophet --

120
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
12 of them refused. Did you know that?

121
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
He told me, "Nobody has to tell me what I should draw.

122
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
This is not how it works."

123
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And then, of course, they were used

124
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
by extremists and politicians on the other side.

125
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
They wanted to stir up controversy.

126
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
You know the story.

127
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We know that cartoons can be used as weapons.

128
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
History tells us,

129
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
they've been used by the Nazis

130
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to attack the Jews.

131
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And here we are now.

132
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
In the United Nations,

133
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
half of the world is pushing

134
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to penalize the offense to religion --

135
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
they call it the defamation of religion --

136
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
while the other half of the world is fighting back

137
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
in defense of freedom of speech.

138
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So the clash of civilizations is here,

139
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and cartoons are at the middle of it?

140
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
This got me thinking.

141
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Now you see me thinking

142
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
at my kitchen table,

143
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and since you're in my kitchen,

144
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
please meet my wife.

145
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
(Laughter)

146
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
In 2006, a few months after,

147
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I went Ivory Coast --

148
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Western Africa.

149
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Now, talk of a divided place -- the country was cut in two.

150
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
You had a rebellion in the North,

151
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
the government in the South -- the capital, Abidjan --

152
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
and in the middle, the French army.

153
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
This looks like a giant hamburger.

154
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
You don't want to be the ham in the middle.

155
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I was there to report on that story

156
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
in cartoons.

157
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I've been doing this for the last 15 years;

158
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
it's my side job, if you want.

159
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So you see the style is different.

160
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
This is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning.

161
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I went to places like Gaza

162
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
during the war in 2009.

163
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So this is really journalism in cartoons.

164
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
You'll hear more and more about it.

165
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
This is the future of journalism, I think.

166
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And of course, I went to see the rebels in the north.

167
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Those were poor guys fighting for their rights.

168
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
There was an ethnic side to this conflict

169
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
as very often in Africa.

170
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And I went to see the Dozo.

171
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
The Dozo, they are the traditional hunters

172
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
of West Africa.

173
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
People fear them --

174
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
they help the rebellion a lot.

175
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
They are believed to have magical powers.

176
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
They can disappear and escape bullets.

177
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I went to see a Dozo chief;

178
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
he told me about his magical powers.

179
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
He said, "I can chop your head off right away

180
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and bring you back to life."

181
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I said, "Well, maybe we don't have time for this right now."

182
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Laughter)

183
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
"Another time."

184
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So back in Abidjan,

185
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I was given a chance to lead a workshop

186
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
with local cartoonists there

187
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and I thought, yes,

188
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
in a context like this, cartoons can really be used as weapons

189
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
against the other side.

190
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I mean, the press in Ivory Coast was bitterly divided --

191
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
it was compared to the media in Rwanda

192
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
before the genocide --

193
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
so imagine.

194
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And what can a cartoonist do?

195
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists

196
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
to draw what they wanted to see,

197
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and the guy has to feed his family, right?

198
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So the idea was pretty simple.

199
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
We brought together cartoonists

200
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
from all sides in Ivory Coast.

201
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
We took them away from their newspaper for three days.

202
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And I asked them to do a project together,

203
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
tackle the issues affecting their country

204
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
in cartoons, yes, in cartoons.

205
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Show the positive power of cartoons.

206
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
It's a great tool of communication

207
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
for bad or for good.

208
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And cartoons can cross boundaries,

209
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
as you have seen.

210
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And humor is a good way, I think,

211
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
to address serious issues.

212
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And I'm very proud of what they did.

213
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I mean, they didn't agree with each other -- that was not the point.

214
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And I didn't ask them to do nice cartoons.

215
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
The first day, they were even shouting at each other.

216
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But they came up with a book,

217
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
looking back at 13 years

218
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
of political crisis in Ivory Coast.

219
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So the idea was there.

220
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And I've been doing projects like this,

221
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
in 2009 in Lebanon,

222
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
this year in Kenya, back in January.

223
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
In Lebanon, it was not a book.

224
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
The idea was to have --

225
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
the same principal, a divided country --

226
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
take cartoonists from all sides

227
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and let them do something together.

228
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So in Lebanon,

229
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
we enrolled the newspaper editors,

230
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and we got them to publish

231
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
eight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page,

232
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
addressing the issue affecting Lebanon,

233
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
like religion in politics and everyday life.

234
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And it worked.

235
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
For three days, almost all the newspapers of Beirut

236
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
published all those cartoonists together --

237
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
anti-government,

238
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
pro-government,

239
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Christian,

240
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Muslim, of course,

241
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
English-speaking, well, you name it.

242
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So this was a great project.

243
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And then in Kenya, what we did

244
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
was addressing the issue of ethnicity,

245
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
which is a poison in a lot of places in Africa.

246
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And we did video clips --

247
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
you can see them if you go to YouTube/Kenyatoons.

248
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So, preaching for freedom of speech

249
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
is easy here,

250
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
but as you have seen

251
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
in contexts of repression or division,

252
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
again, what can a cartoonist do?

253
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
He has to keep his job.

254
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Well I believe that in any context anywhere,

255
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
he always has the choice at least

256
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
not to do a cartoon

257
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that will feed hatred.

258
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And that's the message I try to convey to them.

259
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
I think we all always have the choice in the end

260
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
not to do the bad thing.

261
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But we need to support

262
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
these independent, critical

263
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and responsible voices

264
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
in Africa, in Lebanon,

265
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
in your local newspaper,

266
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
in the Apple store.

267
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Today, tech companies

268
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
are the world's largest editors.

269
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
They decide what is too offensive

270
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
or too provocative for you to see.

271
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
So really, it's not about the freedom of cartoonists;

272
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
it's about your freedoms.

273
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And for dictators all over the world,

274
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
the good news

275
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
is when cartoonists,

276
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
journalists and activists shut up.

277
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Thank you.

278
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
(Applause)

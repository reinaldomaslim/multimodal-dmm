1
0:00:12.613,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I want to give you a new perspective.

2
0:00:15.82,000 --> 0:00:17,000
That sounds grandiose, and it is.

3
0:00:19.38,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I left Ireland yesterday morning.

4
0:00:21.7,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I traveled from Dublin to New York

5
0:00:24.18,000 --> 0:00:25,000
independently.

6
0:00:25.9,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But the design of an airport,

7
0:00:27.82,000 --> 0:00:29,000
plane and terminal

8
0:00:30.38,000 --> 0:00:33,000
offers little independence when you're 105 and a half centimeters tall.

9
0:00:35.02,000 --> 0:00:38,000
For Americans, that's 3' 5".

10
0:00:39.5,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I was whisked through the airport by airline assistants in a wheelchair.

11
0:00:43.82,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Now, I don't need to use a wheelchair,

12
0:00:47.5,000 --> 0:00:49,000
but the design of an airport

13
0:00:49.62,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and its lack of accessibility

14
0:00:51.9,000 --> 0:00:53,000
means that it's my only way to get through.

15
0:00:55.1,000 --> 0:00:57,000
With my carry-on bag between my feet,

16
0:00:57.86,000 --> 0:01:,000
I was wheeled through security, preclearance

17
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and I arrived at my boarding gate.

18
0:01:04.7,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I use the accessibility services in the airport

19
0:01:07.58,000 --> 0:01:1,000
because most of the terminal is just not designed with me in mind.

20
0:01:11.74,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Take security, for example.

21
0:01:14.14,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I'm not strong enough to lift my carry-on bag

22
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
from the ground to the carousel.

23
0:01:20.3,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I stand at eye level with it.

24
0:01:22.38,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And those who work in that space for safety purposes cannot help me

25
0:01:27.34,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and cannot do it for me.

26
0:01:30.02,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Design inhibits my autonomy and my independence.

27
0:01:34.82,000 --> 0:01:37,000
But traveling at this size, it isn't all bad.

28
0:01:38.78,000 --> 0:01:4,000
The leg room in economy is like business class.

29
0:01:41.58,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:44.58,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I often forget that I'm a little person.

31
0:01:47.18,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It's the physical environment and society that remind me.

32
0:01:51.94,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Using a public bathroom is an excruciating experience.

33
0:01:56.7,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I walk into the cubicle

34
0:01:58.9,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but I can't reach the lock on the door.

35
0:02:01.7,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I'm creative and resilient.

36
0:02:04.82,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I look around and see if there's a bin that I can turn upside down.

37
0:02:09.22,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Is it safe?

38
0:02:10.86,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Not really.

39
0:02:12.46,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Is it hygienic and sanitary?

40
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Definitely not.

41
0:02:17.58,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But the alternative is much worse.

42
0:02:20.06,000 --> 0:02:22,000
If that doesn't work, I use my phone.

43
0:02:22.98,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It gives me an additional four- to six-inch reach,

44
0:02:26.06,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and I try to jam the lock closed with my iPhone.

45
0:02:29.54,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now, I imagine that's not what Jony Ive had in mind when he designed the iPhone,

46
0:02:33.98,000 --> 0:02:34,000
but it works.

47
0:02:36.78,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The alternative is that I approach a stranger.

48
0:02:40.3,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I apologize profusely

49
0:02:42.58,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and I ask them to stand guard outside my cubicle door.

50
0:02:46.82,000 --> 0:02:47,000
They do

51
0:02:48.38,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and I emerge grateful

52
0:02:51.3,000 --> 0:02:52,000
but absolutely mortified,

53
0:02:53.86,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and hope that they didn't notice

54
0:02:55.62,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that I left the bathroom without washing my hands.

55
0:02:59.02,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I carry hand sanitizer with me every single day

56
0:03:03.06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
because the sink, soap dispenser, hand dryer and mirror

57
0:03:08.42,000 --> 0:03:09,000
are all out of my reach.

58
0:03:10.94,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Now, the accessible bathroom is somewhat of an option.

59
0:03:13.7,000 --> 0:03:15,000
In this space, I can reach the lock on the door,

60
0:03:16.66,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the sink, the soap dispenser, the hand dryer and the mirror.

61
0:03:22.22,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Yet, I cannot use the toilet.

62
0:03:26.34,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It is deliberately designed higher

63
0:03:28.82,000 --> 0:03:31,000
so that wheelchair users can transfer across with ease.

64
0:03:33.02,000 --> 0:03:36,000
This is a wonderful and necessary innovation,

65
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
but in the design world, when we describe a new project or idea as accessible,

66
0:03:42.5,000 --> 0:03:43,000
what does that mean?

67
0:03:44.74,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Who is it accessible to?

68
0:03:47.66,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And whose needs are not being accommodated for?

69
0:03:51.82,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Now, the bathroom is an example

70
0:03:53.34,000 --> 0:03:55,000
of where design impinges upon my dignity,

71
0:03:56.74,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but the physical environment impacts upon me in much more casual ways too,

72
0:04:01.06,000 --> 0:04:03,000
something as simple as ordering a cup of coffee.

73
0:04:04.14,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Now, I'll admit it.

74
0:04:05.98,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I drink far too much coffee.

75
0:04:08.3,000 --> 0:04:1,000
My order is a skinny vanilla latte,

76
0:04:10.9,000 --> 0:04:12,000
but I'm trying to wean myself off the syrup.

77
0:04:14.62,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But the coffee shop, it's not designed well,

78
0:04:17.38,000 --> 0:04:18,000
at least not for me.

79
0:04:19.34,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Queuing, I'm standing beside the pastry cabinet

80
0:04:22.14,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and the barista calls for the next order.

81
0:04:25.02,000 --> 0:04:27,000
"Next, please!" they shout.

82
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
They can't see me.

83
0:04:30.46,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The person next to me in the queue points to my existence

84
0:04:33.3,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and everyone is embarrassed.

85
0:04:36.06,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I order as quick as I can and I move along to collect my coffee.

86
0:04:40.3,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Now, think just for a second.

87
0:04:43.38,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Where do they put it?

88
0:04:45.78,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Up high and without a lid.

89
0:04:48.3,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Reaching up to collect a coffee that I have paid for

90
0:04:51.22,000 --> 0:04:53,000
is an incredibly dangerous experience.

91
0:04:54.46,000 --> 0:04:57,000
But design also impinges on the clothes that I want to wear.

92
0:04:57.74,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I want garments that reflect my personality.

93
0:05:01.14,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It's difficult to find in the childrenswear department.

94
0:05:04.46,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And often womenswear requires far too many alterations.

95
0:05:08.42,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I want shoes that affect my maturity, professionalism and sophistication.

96
0:05:13.98,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Instead, I'm offered sneakers with Velcro straps and light-up shoes.

97
0:05:19.02,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Now, I'm not totally opposed to light-up shoes.

98
0:05:22.82,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Laughter)

99
0:05:24.9,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But design also impacts on such simple things,

100
0:05:28.34,000 --> 0:05:29,000
like sitting on a chair.

101
0:05:30.74,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I cannot go from a standing to a seating position with grace.

102
0:05:35.14,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Due to the standards of design heights of chairs,

103
0:05:38.42,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I have to crawl on my hands and knees

104
0:05:41.14,000 --> 0:05:42,000
just to get on top of it,

105
0:05:42.78,000 --> 0:05:45,000
whilst also being conscious that it might tip over at any stage.

106
0:05:47.94,000 --> 0:05:48,000
But whilst design impacts on me

107
0:05:49.78,000 --> 0:05:53,000
whether it's a chair, a bathroom, a coffee shop, or clothes,

108
0:05:54.58,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I rely on and benefit

109
0:05:57.78,000 --> 0:05:58,000
from the kindness of strangers.

110
0:06:01.34,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But not everybody is so nice.

111
0:06:04.22,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I'm reminded that I'm a little person

112
0:06:06.82,000 --> 0:06:07,000
when a stranger points,

113
0:06:09.34,000 --> 0:06:1,000
stares,

114
0:06:11.14,000 --> 0:06:12,000
laughs,

115
0:06:13.18,000 --> 0:06:14,000
calls me a name,

116
0:06:14.98,000 --> 0:06:15,000
or takes a photograph of me.

117
0:06:17.78,000 --> 0:06:18,000
This happens almost every day.

118
0:06:20.54,000 --> 0:06:22,000
With the rise of social media, it has given me an opportunity

119
0:06:23.46,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and a platform to have a voice as a blogger and as an activist,

120
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
but it has also made me nervous

121
0:06:30.58,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that I might become a meme

122
0:06:32.7,000 --> 0:06:33,000
or a viral sensation,

123
0:06:35.22,000 --> 0:06:36,000
all without my consent.

124
0:06:38.06,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So let's take a moment right now

125
0:06:40.78,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to make something very clear.

126
0:06:43.54,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The word "midget" is a slur.

127
0:06:47.18,000 --> 0:06:51,000
It evolved from PT Barnum's era of circuses and freak shows.

128
0:06:52.46,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Society has evolved.

129
0:06:55.34,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So should our vocabulary.

130
0:06:57.66,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Language is a powerful tool.

131
0:07:00.06,000 --> 0:07:02,000
It does not just name our society.

132
0:07:02.54,000 --> 0:07:03,000
It shapes it.

133
0:07:04.7,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I am incredibly proud to be a little person,

134
0:07:08.14,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to have inherited the condition of achondroplasia.

135
0:07:11.42,000 --> 0:07:13,000
But I am most proud to be Sinead.

136
0:07:14.5,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism.

137
0:07:18.22,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Achondroplasia translates as "without cartilage formation."

138
0:07:22.58,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I have short limbs and achondroplastic facial features,

139
0:07:26.34,000 --> 0:07:28,000
my forehead and my nose.

140
0:07:29.38,000 --> 0:07:31,000
My arms do not straighten fully,

141
0:07:32.02,000 --> 0:07:33,000
but I can lick my elbow.

142
0:07:34.46,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I'm not showing you that one.

143
0:07:37.02,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Achondroplasia occurs in approximately one in every 20,000 births.

144
0:07:42.34,000 --> 0:07:45,000
80 percent of little people are born to two average-height parents.

145
0:07:46.82,000 --> 0:07:49,000
That means that anybody in this room could have a child with achondroplasia.

146
0:07:51.78,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Yet, I inherited my condition from my dad.

147
0:07:55.7,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I'd like to show you a photo of my family.

148
0:07:59.1,000 --> 0:08:01,000
My mother is average height,

149
0:08:01.14,000 --> 0:08:03,000
my father is a little person

150
0:08:03.38,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and I am the eldest of five children.

151
0:08:06.02,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I have three sisters and one brother.

152
0:08:09.38,000 --> 0:08:1,000
They are all average height.

153
0:08:11.98,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I am incredibly fortunate to have been born into a family

154
0:08:15.42,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that cultivated my curiosity and my tenacity,

155
0:08:19.54,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that protected me from the unkindness and ignorance of strangers

156
0:08:24.54,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and that armed me with the resilience, creativity and confidence

157
0:08:28.74,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that I needed to survive and manipulate the physical environment and society.

158
0:08:34.62,000 --> 0:08:37,000
If I was to pinpoint any reason why I am successful,

159
0:08:38.46,000 --> 0:08:42,000
it is because I was and I am a loved child,

160
0:08:43.38,000 --> 0:08:46,000
now, a loved child with a lot of sass and sarcasm,

161
0:08:47.3,000 --> 0:08:48,000
but a loved child nonetheless.

162
0:08:50.18,000 --> 0:08:52,000
In giving you an insight into who I am today

163
0:08:54.1,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I wanted to offer you a new perspective.

164
0:08:57.02,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I wanted to challenge the idea

165
0:08:58.5,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that design is but a tool to create function and beauty.

166
0:09:03.1,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Design greatly impacts upon people's lives,

167
0:09:07.22,000 --> 0:09:08,000
all lives.

168
0:09:09.18,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Design is a way in which we can feel included in the world,

169
0:09:12.9,000 --> 0:09:16,000
but it is also a way in which we can uphold a person's dignity

170
0:09:17.18,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and their human rights.

171
0:09:19.42,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Design can also inflict vulnerability

172
0:09:22.14,000 --> 0:09:24,000
on a group whose needs aren't considered.

173
0:09:26.14,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So today, I want your perceptions challenged.

174
0:09:30.7,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Who are we not designing for?

175
0:09:32.82,000 --> 0:09:34,000
How can we amplify their voices

176
0:09:35.66,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and their experiences?

177
0:09:38.02,000 --> 0:09:39,000
What is the next step?

178
0:09:40.22,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Design is an enormous privilege,

179
0:09:42.82,000 --> 0:09:43,000
but it is a bigger responsibility.

180
0:09:45.78,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I want you to open your eyes.

181
0:09:48.58,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Thank you so much.

182
0:09:49.82,000 --> 0:09:52,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.984,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Hello.

2
0:00:16.158,000 --> 0:00:18,000
This is my first trip,

3
0:00:18.737,000 --> 0:00:22,000
first time in life I'm outside of the walls of Gaza.

4
0:00:22.999,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I'm so happy to be here.

5
0:00:25.135,000 --> 0:00:3,000
(Applause)

6
0:00:31.083,000 --> 0:00:36,000
My ambition always was to be a pilot, to fly a plane,

7
0:00:36.611,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to feel free to fly the sky, to touch the sky.

8
0:00:42.324,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But that didn't happen.

9
0:00:44.216,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Simply, I live in Gaza, there is no airport.

10
0:00:49.133,000 --> 0:00:52,000
All borders are closed on every side.

11
0:00:52.932,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We live in one of the biggest prisons in the world.

12
0:00:57.097,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The only thing I can do is just to look up to the sky.

13
0:01:02.44,000 --> 0:01:05,000
On some days, we are lucky if we have electricity

14
0:01:05.759,000 --> 0:01:07,000
for four or five hours.

15
0:01:09.01,000 --> 0:01:15,000
When it's cold, we make a fire on the front or on the roof of our homes.

16
0:01:15.188,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Sometimes we make food, too.

17
0:01:18.041,000 --> 0:01:23,000
My job in Gaza is to arrange everything for journalists who come to my homeland

18
0:01:23.32,000 --> 0:01:27,000
to tell the stories about what's going on in Gaza.

19
0:01:28.081,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Many mornings, I had to go to the border area

20
0:01:31.232,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to collect a journalist.

21
0:01:32.904,000 --> 0:01:35,000
If anything should happen to the journalist,

22
0:01:36.189,000 --> 0:01:39,000
or if the journalist decides to cover a story

23
0:01:39.634,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the government doesn't want us to cover,

24
0:01:43.356,000 --> 0:01:44,000
bad things could happen.

25
0:01:46.733,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Navigating through my country helping journalists,

26
0:01:50.01,000 --> 0:01:54,000
filmmakers, news crews, is my working life.

27
0:01:55.607,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I believe my success comes from building a relationship

28
0:02:00.069,000 --> 0:02:03,000
not only with journalists and the news crews,

29
0:02:03.364,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but also with the communities in the Gaza Strip.

30
0:02:06.806,000 --> 0:02:1,000
These communities who don't want their stories to be told,

31
0:02:11.631,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I never looked to them as stories or numbers.

32
0:02:15.742,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But like me, they are human beings.

33
0:02:21.696,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I have built up many relationships over 10 years.

34
0:02:26.582,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And guess what?

35
0:02:28.134,000 --> 0:02:31,000
This gives me the chance to get access to people,

36
0:02:31.625,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to stories that others can't.

37
0:02:34.265,000 --> 0:02:39,000
In some certain situations, I feel, as a woman, I have more power.

38
0:02:41.47,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Many male journalists in my society,

39
0:02:44.073,000 --> 0:02:48,000
they want to cover a story about drug addiction in my country.

40
0:02:48.692,000 --> 0:02:52,000
That problem started when the Gaza tunnel was being built.

41
0:02:54.406,000 --> 0:02:56,000
With the siege on Gaza,

42
0:02:56.617,000 --> 0:02:58,000
tunnels brought people all the basic needs

43
0:02:59.276,000 --> 0:03:02,000
like food, building material, other stuff we needed.

44
0:03:02.788,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But not anymore, because the Egyptian side flooded them up with water

45
0:03:07.598,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and they are not working anymore.

46
0:03:10.389,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Drugs were being smuggled,

47
0:03:12.525,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and many young people got addicted, too.

48
0:03:17.215,000 --> 0:03:19,000
In the tradition of the Palestinian society,

49
0:03:20.087,000 --> 0:03:23,000
it's forbidden for men to enter the household.

50
0:03:24.001,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So, no male journalists get the story.

51
0:03:27.418,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But I did.

52
0:03:30.898,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I have a wonderful husband,

53
0:03:33.868,000 --> 0:03:35,000
a wonderful husband who supports me

54
0:03:36.694,000 --> 0:03:39,000
despite all the criticism he gets from the society.

55
0:03:40.812,000 --> 0:03:42,000
He's at home now with my two kids,

56
0:03:43.576,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and I have another one that's growing in here.

57
0:03:46.869,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Applause)

58
0:03:52.594,000 --> 0:03:55,000
When I'm working, I call him every two hours,

59
0:03:55.963,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and he knows if he doesn't hear from me,

60
0:03:59.777,000 --> 0:04:,000
he should call my contact,

61
0:04:01.228,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the one who gives me access to the story,

62
0:04:04.414,000 --> 0:04:06,000
which is the one who I trust.

63
0:04:09.105,000 --> 0:04:11,000
One of the times in Gaza,

64
0:04:11.154,000 --> 0:04:15,000
during the kidnapping of the British journalist Alan Johnston,

65
0:04:16.117,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I was asked by an American magazine

66
0:04:20.04,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to set up a meeting with the kidnappers in Gaza, and I did.

67
0:04:26.014,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The journalist covering the story and I

68
0:04:29.347,000 --> 0:04:32,000
were asked to meet outside of his hotel.

69
0:04:33.861,000 --> 0:04:37,000
They came, they picked us up in a black van with black windows,

70
0:04:38.762,000 --> 0:04:4,000
they were wearing masks on that day.

71
0:04:43.136,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And they drove us away, far away in the middle of a field.

72
0:04:48.971,000 --> 0:04:5,000
They took our cell phones

73
0:04:51.455,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and we did the interview with the kidnapper outside in that field.

74
0:04:57.577,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I was so scared that day,

75
0:04:59.383,000 --> 0:05:01,000
a day I will never forget.

76
0:05:03.694,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So, why do I do what I do?

77
0:05:07.044,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I do it because I believe if I didn't,

78
0:05:10.387,000 --> 0:05:14,000
a huge part of the story about Gaza will be missing.

79
0:05:15.745,000 --> 0:05:19,000
There are some more stories I could tell you about my country.

80
0:05:20.15,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And not all of them are bad.

81
0:05:22.915,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I love my country, despite the terrible situation we live in --

82
0:05:27.588,000 --> 0:05:3,000
siege, poverty, unemployment --

83
0:05:31.531,000 --> 0:05:32,000
but there is life.

84
0:05:33.644,000 --> 0:05:38,000
There are people who are dreamers and amazing people full of energy.

85
0:05:40.28,000 --> 0:05:43,000
We have wonderful music, and a great music school.

86
0:05:44.129,000 --> 0:05:48,000
We have parkour dancers who dance in the rubble of their homes.

87
0:05:49.6,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And Gaza is the only place in the Arab world

88
0:05:52.922,000 --> 0:05:56,000
where Muslims and Christians live in strong brotherhood.

89
0:05:58.565,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Applause)

90
0:06:03.684,000 --> 0:06:04,000
During the time of war,

91
0:06:05.256,000 --> 0:06:09,000
the hardest part for me is leaving the house early in the morning,

92
0:06:09.352,000 --> 0:06:1,000
leaving my children.

93
0:06:11.046,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I take a picture of them everyday

94
0:06:15.403,000 --> 0:06:18,000
because I never know if I will make it back to them.

95
0:06:20.364,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Being a fixer and a journalist is difficult and dangerous in Gaza.

96
0:06:26.529,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But when I hear the sound of the shelling or the sound of the bombing,

97
0:06:30.235,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I just head straight toward it,

98
0:06:33.197,000 --> 0:06:36,000
because I want to be there first,

99
0:06:37.197,000 --> 0:06:4,000
because these stories should be told.

100
0:06:43.603,000 --> 0:06:47,000
When my children were small and we heard the sound of the war,

101
0:06:48.376,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I used to tell them that they were fireworks.

102
0:06:52.238,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Now they are older, they understand.

103
0:06:56.469,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I do have terrible nightmares

104
0:06:59.684,000 --> 0:07:03,000
because of all that I witnessed during war times,

105
0:07:03.922,000 --> 0:07:07,000
especially these lifeless bodies of young children.

106
0:07:08.201,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I still remember a little girl, her name is Hala.

107
0:07:12.503,000 --> 0:07:14,000
She's the only survivor from her family.

108
0:07:15.806,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Her picture will be with me forever.

109
0:07:18.902,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I will never forget her.

110
0:07:24.738,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I'm proud that I can stand here and be here today with you.

111
0:07:30.224,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I'm proud that I can tell you stories, sad and happy,

112
0:07:36.683,000 --> 0:07:4,000
stories about my small corner of the world, Gaza.

113
0:07:41.185,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I'm proud that I am the first female fixer working in Gaza.

114
0:07:46.198,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And the funny thing is they call me Mr. Rambo in Gaza.

115
0:07:49.852,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Laughter)

116
0:07:52.677,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I hope one day, I will get the chance to tell the stories of all other women,

117
0:07:57.65,000 --> 0:08:,000
all other amazing women I know in my country.

118
0:08:01.187,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I hope that one day I can help other women in my country

119
0:08:05.228,000 --> 0:08:07,000
to be fixers like me.

120
0:08:07.44,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And of course sometimes, I feel I can't do this work anymore,

121
0:08:11.772,000 --> 0:08:13,000
it's just too much for me.

122
0:08:14.041,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But I remember these words:

123
0:08:16.603,000 --> 0:08:19,000
"Don't limit your challenge, but challenge your limit.

124
0:08:20.173,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Don't allow others to stand in front of your dreams."

125
0:08:25.502,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Thank you.

126
0:08:26.687,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.951,000 --> 0:00:15,000
My grandfather was a cobbler.

2
0:00:16.66,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Back in the day, he made custom-made shoes.

3
0:00:19.899,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I never got to meet him.

4
0:00:22.11,000 --> 0:00:24,000
He perished in the Holocaust.

5
0:00:24.91,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But I did inherit his love for making,

6
0:00:28.988,000 --> 0:00:31,000
except that it doesn't exist that much anymore.

7
0:00:32.926,000 --> 0:00:34,000
You see, while the Industrial Revolution

8
0:00:35.436,000 --> 0:00:37,000
did a great deal to improve humanity,

9
0:00:38.179,000 --> 0:00:4,000
it eradicated the very skill

10
0:00:41.116,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that my grandfather loved,

11
0:00:44.136,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it.

12
0:00:47.437,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But all of that is about to change with 3D printing,

13
0:00:52.74,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and it all started with this,

14
0:00:57.818,000 --> 0:00:58,000
the very first part

15
0:00:59.65,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that was ever printed.

16
0:01:01.91,000 --> 0:01:03,000
It's a little older than TED.

17
0:01:04.473,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It was printed in 1983

18
0:01:07.12,000 --> 0:01:09,000
by Chuck Hull,

19
0:01:09.84,000 --> 0:01:12,000
who invented 3D printing.

20
0:01:13.448,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But the thing that I want to talk to you about today,

21
0:01:15.631,000 --> 0:01:16,000
the big idea that I want to discuss with you,

22
0:01:17.561,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is not that 3D printing

23
0:01:19.464,000 --> 0:01:22,000
is going to catapult us into the future,

24
0:01:22.724,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but rather that it's actually going

25
0:01:25.12,000 --> 0:01:28,000
to connect us with our heritage,

26
0:01:28.213,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and it's going to usher in a new era

27
0:01:31.237,000 --> 0:01:34,000
of localized, distributed manufacturing

28
0:01:35.121,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that is actually based

29
0:01:36.853,000 --> 0:01:38,000
on digital fabrication.

30
0:01:39.312,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So think about useful things.

31
0:01:45.11,000 --> 0:01:46,000
You all know your shoe size.

32
0:01:46.953,000 --> 0:01:47,000
How many of you know the size

33
0:01:48.631,000 --> 0:01:49,000
of the bridge of your nose

34
0:01:50.116,000 --> 0:01:53,000
or the distance between your temples?

35
0:01:53.379,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Anybody?

36
0:01:55.91,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Wouldn't it be awesome if you could,

37
0:01:57.708,000 --> 0:01:59,000
for the first time, get eyewear

38
0:01:59.98,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that actually fits you perfectly

39
0:02:03.19,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and doesn't require any hinge assembly,

40
0:02:06.865,000 --> 0:02:09,000
so chances are, the hinges are not going to break?

41
0:02:10.422,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But the implications of 3D printing

42
0:02:13.02,000 --> 0:02:16,000
go well beyond the tips of our noses.

43
0:02:16.477,000 --> 0:02:18,000
When I met Amanda for the first time,

44
0:02:18.805,000 --> 0:02:2,000
she could already stand up and walk a little bit

45
0:02:21.4,000 --> 0:02:23,000
even though she was paralyzed from the waist down,

46
0:02:24.355,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but she complained to me that her suit

47
0:02:27.07,000 --> 0:02:28,000
was uncomfortable.

48
0:02:28.995,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It was a beautiful robotic suit

49
0:02:30.446,000 --> 0:02:31,000
made by Ekso Bionics,

50
0:02:32.134,000 --> 0:02:35,000
but it wasn't inspired by her body.

51
0:02:35.902,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It wasn't made to measure.

52
0:02:38.219,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So she challenged me to make her something

53
0:02:40.942,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that was a little bit more feminine,

54
0:02:44.103,000 --> 0:02:47,000
a little bit more elegant,

55
0:02:47.331,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and lightweight,

56
0:02:48.585,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and like good tailors,

57
0:02:50.117,000 --> 0:02:54,000
we thought that we would measure her digitally.

58
0:02:54.497,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And we did. We built her an amazing suit.

59
0:02:57.586,000 --> 0:03:,000
The incredible part about what I learned

60
0:03:00.594,000 --> 0:03:03,000
from Amanda is a lot of us are looking at 3D printing

61
0:03:03.744,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and we say to ourselves,

62
0:03:05.442,000 --> 0:03:07,000
it's going to replace traditional methods.

63
0:03:08.3,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Amanda looked at it and she said,

64
0:03:10.28,000 --> 0:03:11,000
it's an opportunity for me

65
0:03:12.17,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to reclaim my symmetry

66
0:03:14.375,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and to embrace my authenticity.

67
0:03:17.353,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And you know what? She's not standing still.

68
0:03:19.482,000 --> 0:03:21,000
She now wants to walk in high heels.

69
0:03:24.94,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It doesn't stop there.

70
0:03:26.339,000 --> 0:03:28,000
3D printing is changing

71
0:03:29.29,000 --> 0:03:32,000
personalized medical devices as we know them,

72
0:03:32.641,000 --> 0:03:36,000
from new, beautiful, conformal,

73
0:03:37.086,000 --> 0:03:4,000
ventilated scoliosis braces

74
0:03:40.167,000 --> 0:03:43,000
to millions of dental restorations

75
0:03:43.529,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and to beautiful bracings

76
0:03:47.026,000 --> 0:03:5,000
for amputees,

77
0:03:50.189,000 --> 0:03:53,000
another opportunity to emotionally reconnect

78
0:03:53.361,000 --> 0:03:55,000
with your symmetry.

79
0:03:55.881,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And as we sit here today,

80
0:03:58.332,000 --> 0:04:,000
you can go wireless on your braces

81
0:04:01.179,000 --> 0:04:03,000
with clear aligners,

82
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
or your dental restorations.

83
0:04:05.399,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Millions of in-the-ear hearing aids

84
0:04:07.591,000 --> 0:04:09,000
are already 3D printed today.

85
0:04:10.358,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Millions of people are served today

86
0:04:12.723,000 --> 0:04:14,000
from these devices.

87
0:04:15.419,000 --> 0:04:18,000
What about full knee replacements,

88
0:04:19.179,000 --> 0:04:22,000
from your data, made to measure,

89
0:04:22.246,000 --> 0:04:26,000
where all of the tools and guides are 3D printed?

90
0:04:26.708,000 --> 0:04:29,000
G.E. is using 3D printing

91
0:04:30.216,000 --> 0:04:32,000
to make the next generation LEAP engine

92
0:04:32.894,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that will save fuel to the tune

93
0:04:36.59,000 --> 0:04:38,000
of about 15 percent

94
0:04:39.306,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and cost for an airline

95
0:04:41.498,000 --> 0:04:43,000
of about 14 million dollars.

96
0:04:43.893,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Good for G.E., right?

97
0:04:45.575,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And their customers and the environment.

98
0:04:48.108,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But, you know, the even better news

99
0:04:50.568,000 --> 0:04:53,000
is that this technology is no longer reserved

100
0:04:53.799,000 --> 0:04:55,000
for deep-pocketed corporations.

101
0:04:56.465,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Planetary Resources, a startup

102
0:04:59.7,000 --> 0:05:,000
for space explorations

103
0:05:01.194,000 --> 0:05:05,000
is going to put out its first space probe later this year.

104
0:05:05.75,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It was a fraction of a NASA spaceship,

105
0:05:09.2,000 --> 0:05:12,000
it costs a fraction of its cost,

106
0:05:12.669,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and it's made with less than a dozen moving parts,

107
0:05:16.36,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and it's going to be out in space later this year.

108
0:05:20.039,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Google is taking on this very audacious project

109
0:05:23.402,000 --> 0:05:25,000
of making the block phone, the Ara.

110
0:05:26.104,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It's only possible because of the development

111
0:05:28.617,000 --> 0:05:3,000
of high-speed 3D printing that for the first time

112
0:05:31.166,000 --> 0:05:35,000
will make functional, usable modules

113
0:05:35.526,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that will go into it.

114
0:05:36.922,000 --> 0:05:39,000
A real moonshot, powered by 3D printing.

115
0:05:40.22,000 --> 0:05:42,000
How about food?

116
0:05:42.768,000 --> 0:05:44,000
What if we could, for the first time,

117
0:05:45.292,000 --> 0:05:47,000
make incredible delectables

118
0:05:48.279,000 --> 0:05:52,000
like this beautiful TED Teddy here,

119
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that are edible?

120
0:05:54.826,000 --> 0:05:57,000
What if we could completely change the experience,

121
0:05:58.51,000 --> 0:06:01,000
like you see with that absinthe serving

122
0:06:02.315,000 --> 0:06:05,000
that is completely 3D printed?

123
0:06:06.065,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And what if we could begin to put ingredients

124
0:06:10.868,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and colors and flavors in every taste,

125
0:06:14.309,000 --> 0:06:16,000
which means not only delicious foods

126
0:06:17.107,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but the promise of personalized nutrition

127
0:06:20.924,000 --> 0:06:21,000
around the corner?

128
0:06:22.278,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And that gets me to one of the biggest deals about 3D printing.

129
0:06:25.423,000 --> 0:06:27,000
With 3D printing, complexity is free.

130
0:06:28.284,000 --> 0:06:3,000
The printer doesn't care

131
0:06:31.146,000 --> 0:06:33,000
if it makes the most rudimentary shape

132
0:06:33.79,000 --> 0:06:35,000
or the most complex shape,

133
0:06:35.99,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and that is completely turning design

134
0:06:39.148,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and manufacturing on its head as we know it.

135
0:06:42.694,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Many people think that 3D printing will be

136
0:06:45.021,000 --> 0:06:48,000
the end of manufacturing as we know it.

137
0:06:48.759,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I think that it's the opportunity to put

138
0:06:51.272,000 --> 0:06:54,000
tomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters

139
0:06:54.933,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that will create endless abundance

140
0:06:57.536,000 --> 0:06:58,000
of job opportunities,

141
0:06:59.456,000 --> 0:07:,000
and with that,

142
0:07:01.42,000 --> 0:07:03,000
everybody can become an expert maker

143
0:07:04.314,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and an expert manufacturer.

144
0:07:06.418,000 --> 0:07:07,000
That will take new tools.

145
0:07:08.304,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Not everybody knows how to use CAD,

146
0:07:11.037,000 --> 0:07:13,000
so we're developing haptics,

147
0:07:13.08,000 --> 0:07:14,000
perceptual devices

148
0:07:15.019,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that will allow you to touch

149
0:07:16.92,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and feel your designs

150
0:07:18.685,000 --> 0:07:2,000
as if you play with digital clay.

151
0:07:21.563,000 --> 0:07:22,000
When you do things like that,

152
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and we also developed things that take

153
0:07:25.263,000 --> 0:07:27,000
physical photographs that are instantly printable,

154
0:07:27.817,000 --> 0:07:29,000
it will make it easier to create content,

155
0:07:30.467,000 --> 0:07:33,000
but with all of the unimagined,

156
0:07:33.498,000 --> 0:07:35,000
we will also have the unintended,

157
0:07:35.89,000 --> 0:07:4,000
like democratized counterfeiting

158
0:07:41.166,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and ubiquitous illegal possession.

159
0:07:44.15,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So many people ask me,

160
0:07:45.633,000 --> 0:07:47,000
will we have a 3D printer in every home?

161
0:07:48.141,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I think it's the wrong question to ask.

162
0:07:50.394,000 --> 0:07:51,000
The right question to ask is,

163
0:07:51.775,000 --> 0:07:54,000
how will 3D printing change my life?

164
0:07:55.54,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Or, in other words, what room in my house

165
0:07:57.73,000 --> 0:07:59,000
will 3D printing fit in?

166
0:07:59.894,000 --> 0:08:,000
So everything that you see here

167
0:08:01.89,000 --> 0:08:03,000
has been 3D printed,

168
0:08:04.001,000 --> 0:08:07,000
including these shoes

169
0:08:07.08,000 --> 0:08:09,000
at the Amsterdam fashion show.

170
0:08:09.322,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Now, these are not my grandfather's shoes.

171
0:08:13.018,000 --> 0:08:14,000
These are shoes that represent

172
0:08:14.71,000 --> 0:08:16,000
the continuation of his passion

173
0:08:16.908,000 --> 0:08:18,000
for hyper-local manufacturing.

174
0:08:19.288,000 --> 0:08:24,000
My grandfather didn't get to see Nike

175
0:08:24.531,000 --> 0:08:28,000
printing cleats for the recent Super Bowl,

176
0:08:29.08,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and my father didn't get to see me standing

177
0:08:32.487,000 --> 0:08:35,000
in my hybridized 3D printed shoes.

178
0:08:35.597,000 --> 0:08:37,000
He passed away three years ago.

179
0:08:38.348,000 --> 0:08:41,000
But Chuck Hull, the man that invented it all,

180
0:08:41.591,000 --> 0:08:43,000
is right here in the house today,

181
0:08:43.96,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and thanks to him,

182
0:08:45.742,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I can say, thanks to his invention, I can say

183
0:08:48.46,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that I am a cobbler too,

184
0:08:50.437,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and by standing in these shoes

185
0:08:52.891,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I am honoring my past

186
0:08:55.225,000 --> 0:08:57,000
while manufacturing the future.

187
0:08:57.377,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Thank you.

188
0:08:58.9,000 --> 0:09:01,000
(Applause)

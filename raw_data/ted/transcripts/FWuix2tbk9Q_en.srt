1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Frank Gehry: I listened to this scientist this morning.

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Dr. Mullis was talking about his experiments,

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and I realized that I almost became a scientist.

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
When I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set

5
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and I decided to make water.

6
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So, I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator,

8
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker

9
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and I threw a match in.

10
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And the glass -- luckily I turned around --

12
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I had it all in my back

13
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and I was about 15 feet away.

14
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The wall was covered with ...

15
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I had an explosion.

16
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Richard Saul Wurman: Really?

17
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
FG: People on the street came and knocked on the door

18
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to see if I was okay.

19
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
RSW: ... huh. (Laughter)

20
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I'd like to start

21
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
this session again.

22
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
The gentleman to my left is the very famous, perhaps overly famous,

23
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Frank Gehry.

24
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Applause)

26
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And Frank, you've come to a place in your life, which is astonishing.

27
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I mean it is astonishing for an artist, for an architect,

28
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time.

29
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I mean you have become, whether you can giggle at it

30
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
because it's a funny ... you know, it's a strange thought,

31
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
but your building is an icon --

32
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
you can draw a little picture of that building, it can be used in ads --

33
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and you've had not rock star status, but celebrity status

34
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life.

35
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And I know the road was extremely difficult.

36
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And it didn't seem, at least, that your sell outs,

37
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
whatever they were, were very big.

38
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
You kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependent

39
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
on working for somebody.

40
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But that's an interesting thing for a creative person.

41
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
A lot of us work for people;

42
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
we're in the hands of other people.

43
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And that's one of the great dilemmas -- we're in a creativity session --

44
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
it's one of the great dilemmas in creativity:

45
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
how to do work that's big enough and not sell out.

46
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And you've achieved that

47
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and that makes your win doubly big, triply big.

48
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It's not quite a question but you can comment on it.

49
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
It's a big issue.

50
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
FG: Well, I've always just ...

51
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I've never really gone out looking for work.

52
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head.

53
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And when I started out,

54
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I thought that architecture was a service business

55
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and that you had to please the clients and stuff.

56
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And I realized when I'd come into the meetings

57
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff,

58
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and people would just look at me

59
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
like I'd just landed from Mars.

60
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But I couldn't do anything else.

61
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
That was my response to the people in the time.

62
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And actually, it was responding to clients that I had

63
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
who didn't have very much money, so they couldn't afford very much.

64
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I think it was circumstantial.

65
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Until I got to my house, where the client was my wife.

66
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica

67
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and for like 50 grand I built a house around it.

68
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And a few people got excited about it.

69
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I was visiting with an artist, Michael Heizer,

70
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere.

71
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
He's building this huge concrete place.

72
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And it was late in the evening. We'd had a lot to drink.

73
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
We were standing out in the desert all alone and,

74
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
thinking about my house, he said,

75
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
"Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent,

76
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
somewhere in 2000 years somebody's going to like it?"

77
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Laughter)

78
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So, I thought, "Yeah, that's probably a good idea."

79
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money,

80
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
so the stuff was a little more permanent.

81
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But I just found out the world ain't going to last that long,

82
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
this guy was telling us the other day.

83
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So where do we go now?

84
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Back to -- everything's so temporary.

85
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I don't see it the way you characterized it.

86
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
For me, every day is a new thing.

87
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I approach each project with a new insecurity,

88
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
almost like the first project I ever did,

89
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and I get the sweats,

90
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I go in and start working, I'm not sure where I'm going --

91
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
if I knew where I was going, I wouldn't do it.

92
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
When I can predict or plan it, I don't do it.

93
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I discard it.

94
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So I approach it with the same trepidation.

95
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Obviously, over time I have a lot more confidence

96
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that it's going to be OK.

97
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I do run a kind of a business --

98
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I've got 120 people

99
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and you've got to pay them,

100
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
so there's a lot of responsibility involved --

101
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
but the actual work on the project is with,

102
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I think, a healthy insecurity.

103
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And like the playwright said the other day -- I could relate to him:

104
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
you're not sure.

105
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it,

106
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I saw all the mistakes, I saw ...

107
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
They weren't mistakes;

108
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I saw everything that I would have changed

109
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and I was embarrassed by it.

110
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I felt an embarrassment -- "How could I have done that?

111
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that?"

112
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It's taken several years to now look at it detached and say --

113
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road

114
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and the street, and it appears to have a relationship --

115
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that I started to like it.

116
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
RSW: What's the status of the New York project?

117
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
FG: I don't really know.

118
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Tom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me,

119
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and I thought he was nuts.

120
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I didn't think he knew what he was doing,

121
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and he pulled it off.

122
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So, I think he's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy.

123
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
(Laughter)

124
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
He gets up there and then he ... comes back up.

125
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
They're still talking about it.

126
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
September 11 generated some interest

127
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
in moving it over to Ground Zero,

128
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and I'm totally against that.

129
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero

130
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I think for a long time.

131
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
RSW: The picture on the screen,

132
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is that Disney?

133
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
FG: Yeah.

134
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
RSW: How much further along is it than that,

135
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and when will that be finished?

136
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
FG: That will be finished in 2003 -- September, October --

137
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and I'm hoping Kyu, and Herbie, and Yo-Yo and all those guys

138
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
come play with us at that place.

139
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Luckily, today most of the people I'm working with are people I really like.

140
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons

141
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that Disney Hall came to me.

142
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
He's been a cheerleader for quite a long time.

143
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
There aren't many people around that are really involved

144
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
with architecture as clients.

145
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
If you think about the world,

146
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and even just in this audience,

147
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
most of us are involved with buildings.

148
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Nothing that you would call architecture, right?

149
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And so to find one, a guy like that,

150
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
you hang on to him.

151
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
He's become the head of Art Center,

152
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and there's a building by Craig Ellwood there.

153
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I knew Craig and respected him.

154
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
They want to add to it

155
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and it's hard to add to a building like that --

156
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
it's a beautiful, minimalist, black steel building --

157
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff

158
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and it's a lot of acreage.

159
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I convinced him to let me bring in another architect

160
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
from Portugal: Alvaro Siza.

161
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
RSW: Why did you want that?

162
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
FG: I knew you'd ask that question.

163
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
It was intuitive.

164
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
(Laughter)

165
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal

166
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture.

167
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I visited with him a few years ago

168
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and he showed me his early work,

169
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and his early work had a resemblance to my early work.

170
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
When I came out of college,

171
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California,

172
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs

173
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and things like that.

174
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I tried to understand that language as a beginning,

175
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
as a place to jump off,

176
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and there was so much of it being done by spec builders

177
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't ...

178
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I just stopped.

179
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I mean, Charlie Moore did a bunch of it,

180
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
but it didn't feel good to me.

181
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Siza, on the other hand, continued in Portugal

182
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
where the real stuff was

183
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language.

184
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And I always felt that he should come to Southern California

185
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and do a building.

186
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out.

187
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I like the idea of collaboration with people like that

188
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
because it pushes you.

189
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra,

190
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
who doesn't think architecture is art.

191
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Did you see that thing?

192
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
RSW: No. What did he say?

193
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
FG: He calls architecture "plumbing."

194
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
(Laughter)

195
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
FG: Anyway, the Siza thing.

196
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
It's a richer experience.

197
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
It must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians --

198
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
it's similar to that I would imagine --

199
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
where you ... huh?

200
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Audience: Liquid architecture.

201
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
FG: Liquid architecture.

202
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
(Laughter)

203
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Where you ... It's like jazz: you improvise, you work together,

204
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
you play off each other, you make something,

205
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
they make something.

206
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And I think

207
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
for me, it's a way of trying to understand the city

208
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and what might happen in the city.

209
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
RSW: Is it going to be near the current campus?

210
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Or is it going to be down near ...

211
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
FG: No, it's near the current campus.

212
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Anyway, he's that kind of patron.

213
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It's not his money, of course.

214
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
(Laughter)

215
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
RSW: What's his schedule on that?

216
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
FG: I don't know.

217
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
What's the schedule, Richard?

218
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Richard Koshalek: [Unclear] starts from 2004.

219
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
FG: 2004.

220
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
You can come to the opening. I'll invite you.

221
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
No, but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting

222
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
because it creates chaos, right?

223
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment,

224
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and if you can figure out how to work off each other --

225
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
if you can get a bunch of people

226
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
who respect each other's work and play off each other,

227
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
you might be able to create models for

228
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect.

229
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Like the Rockefeller Center model,

230
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
which is kind of from another era.

231
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
RSW: I found the most remarkable thing.

232
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building,

233
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
you go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces.

234
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
I'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED.

235
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city.

236
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
That was the surprise of going across the river,

237
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
of going on the highway around it,

238
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
of walking down the street and finding it.

239
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
That was the real surprise of Bilbao.

240
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
FG: But you know, Richard,

241
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
most architects when they present their work --

242
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
most of the people we know,

243
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
you get up and you talk about your work,

244
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and it's almost like you tell everybody you're a good guy

245
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
by saying, "Look, I'm worried about the context,

246
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
I'm worried about the city,

247
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I'm worried about my client,

248
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
I worry about budget, that I'm on time."

249
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Blah, blah, blah and all that stuff.

250
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And it's like cleansing yourself so that you can ...

251
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
by saying all that, it means your work is good somehow.

252
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And I think everybody --

253
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I mean that should be a matter of fact, like gravity.

254
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
You're not going to defy gravity.

255
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
You've got to work with the building department.

256
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
If you don't meet the budgets, you're not going to get much work.

257
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
If it leaks --

258
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Bilbao did not leak.

259
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
I was so proud.

260
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
(Laughter)

261
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
The MIT project -- they were interviewing me for MIT

262
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and they sent their facilities people to Bilbao.

263
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I met them in Bilbao.

264
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
They came for three days.

265
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
RSW: This is the computer building?

266
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
FG: Yeah, the computer building.

267
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
They were there three days and it rained every day

268
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and they kept walking around --

269
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
I noticed they were looking under things

270
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and looking for things,

271
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden, you know?

272
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
People put buckets out ...

273
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
I was clean. There wasn't a bloody leak in the place,

274
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
it was just fantastic.

275
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
But you've got to --

276
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
yeah, well up until then every building leaked, so this ...

277
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
(Laughter)

278
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
RSW: Frank had a sort of ...

279
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
FG: Ask Miriam!

280
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
RW: ... sort of had a fame. His fame was built on that in L.A. for a while.

281
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
(Laughter)

282
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
FG: You've all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story,

283
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
when the woman called and said,

284
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
"Mr. Wright, I'm sitting on the couch

285
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and the water's pouring in on my head."

286
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And he said, "Madam, move your chair."

287
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
(Laughter)

288
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
So, some years later I was doing a building,

289
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
a little house on the beach for Norton Simon,

290
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and his secretary, who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady,

291
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
called me and said,

292
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
"Mr. Simon's sitting at his desk

293
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and the water's coming in on his head."

294
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story.

295
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
RSW: Didn't get a laugh.

296
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
FG: No. Not now either.

297
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
(Laughter)

298
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
But my point is that ... and I call it the "then what?"

299
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
OK, you solved all the problems,

300
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
you did all the stuff, you made nice,

301
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
you loved your clients,

302
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
you loved the city,

303
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
you're a good guy, you're a good person ...

304
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and then what?

305
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
What do you bring to it?

306
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And I think that's what I've always been interested in,

307
0:16:51.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
is that -- which is a personal kind of expression.

308
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Bilbao, I think, shows that you can have

309
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
that kind of personal expression

310
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
and still touch all the bases that are necessary

311
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
of fitting into the city.

312
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
That's what reminded me of it.

313
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
And I think that's the issue, you know;

314
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
it's the "then what" that most clients who hire architects --

315
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
most clients aren't hiring architects for that.

316
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:35,000
They're hiring them to get it done, get it on budget,

317
0:17:35.16,000 --> 0:17:38,000
be polite,

318
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:49,000
and they're missing out on the real value of an architect.

319
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
RSW: At a certain point a number of years ago, people --

320
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:59,000
when Michael Graves was a fashion, before teapots ...

321
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:02,000
FG: I did a teapot and nobody bought it.

322
0:18:02.16,000 --> 0:18:04,000
(Laughter)

323
0:18:04.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
RSW: Did it leak?

324
0:18:06.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
FG: No.

325
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
(Laughter)

326
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
RSW: ... people wanted a Michael Graves building.

327
0:18:21.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
Is that a curse, that people want a Bilbao building?

328
0:18:26.16,000 --> 0:18:29,000
FG: Yeah.

329
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
Since Bilbao opened, which is now four, five years,

330
0:18:34.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
both Krens and I have been called

331
0:18:39.16,000 --> 0:18:43,000
with at least 100 opportunities --

332
0:18:43.16,000 --> 0:18:5,000
China, Brazil, other parts of Spain --

333
0:18:50.16,000 --> 0:18:53,000
to come in and do the Bilbao effect.

334
0:18:53.16,000 --> 0:18:56,000
And I've met with some of these people.

335
0:18:56.16,000 --> 0:18:58,000
Usually I say no right away,

336
0:18:58.16,000 --> 0:19:01,000
but some of them come with pedigree

337
0:19:01.16,000 --> 0:19:04,000
and they sound well-intentioned

338
0:19:04.16,000 --> 0:19:09,000
and they get you for at least one or two meetings.

339
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:15,000
In one case, I flew all the way to Malaga with a team

340
0:19:15.16,000 --> 0:19:21,000
because the thing was signed with seals and various

341
0:19:21.16,000 --> 0:19:27,000
very official seals from the city,

342
0:19:27.16,000 --> 0:19:31,000
and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port.

343
0:19:31.16,000 --> 0:19:33,000
I asked them what kind of building it was.

344
0:19:33.16,000 --> 0:19:36,000
"When you get here we'll explain it." Blah, blah, blah.

345
0:19:36.16,000 --> 0:19:39,000
So four of us went.

346
0:19:39.16,000 --> 0:19:44,000
And they took us -- they put us up in a great hotel

347
0:19:44.16,000 --> 0:19:47,000
and we were looking over the bay,

348
0:19:47.16,000 --> 0:19:5,000
and then they took us in a boat out in the water

349
0:19:50.16,000 --> 0:19:53,000
and showed us all these sights in the harbor.

350
0:19:53.16,000 --> 0:19:58,000
Each one was more beautiful than the other.

351
0:19:59.16,000 --> 0:20:03,000
And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor

352
0:20:03.16,000 --> 0:20:05,000
and we were going to have dinner with

353
0:20:05.16,000 --> 0:20:09,000
the most important people in Malaga.

354
0:20:09.16,000 --> 0:20:12,000
Just before going to lunch with the mayor,

355
0:20:13.16,000 --> 0:20:15,000
we went to the harbor commissioner.

356
0:20:15.16,000 --> 0:20:18,000
It was a table as long as this carpet

357
0:20:18.16,000 --> 0:20:2,000
and the harbor commissioner was here,

358
0:20:20.16,000 --> 0:20:22,000
and I was here, and my guys.

359
0:20:22.16,000 --> 0:20:25,000
We sat down, and we had a drink of water

360
0:20:25.16,000 --> 0:20:27,000
and everybody was quiet.

361
0:20:27.16,000 --> 0:20:29,000
And the guy looked at me and said,

362
0:20:29.16,000 --> 0:20:32,000
"Now what can I do for you, Mr. Gehry?"

363
0:20:32.16,000 --> 0:20:36,000
(Laughter)

364
0:20:36.16,000 --> 0:20:38,000
RSW: Oh, my God.

365
0:20:38.16,000 --> 0:20:4,000
FG: So, I got up.

366
0:20:40.16,000 --> 0:20:42,000
I said to my team,

367
0:20:42.16,000 --> 0:20:44,000
"Let's get out of here."

368
0:20:44.16,000 --> 0:20:45,000
We stood up, we walked out.

369
0:20:45.16,000 --> 0:20:48,000
They followed -- the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said,

370
0:20:48.16,000 --> 0:20:5,000
"You mean you're not going to have lunch with the mayor?"

371
0:20:50.16,000 --> 0:20:52,000
I said, "Nope."

372
0:20:52.16,000 --> 0:20:54,000
"You're not going to have dinner at all?"

373
0:20:54.16,000 --> 0:20:58,000
They just brought us there to hustle this group,

374
0:20:58.16,000 --> 0:21:,000
you know, to create a project.

375
0:21:00.16,000 --> 0:21:02,000
And we get a lot of that.

376
0:21:05.16,000 --> 0:21:08,000
Luckily, I'm old enough that

377
0:21:08.16,000 --> 0:21:11,000
I can complain I can't travel.

378
0:21:11.16,000 --> 0:21:13,000
(Laughter)

379
0:21:13.16,000 --> 0:21:16,000
I don't have my own plane yet.

380
0:21:18.16,000 --> 0:21:21,000
RSW: Well, I'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting

381
0:21:21.16,000 --> 0:21:23,000
because it's been very long.

382
0:21:23.16,000 --> 0:21:25,000
But let me just say a couple words.

383
0:21:25.16,000 --> 0:21:27,000
FG: Can I say something?

384
0:21:28.16,000 --> 0:21:31,000
Are you going to talk about me or you?

385
0:21:31.16,000 --> 0:21:34,000
(Laughter)

386
0:21:34.16,000 --> 0:21:37,000
(Applause)

387
0:21:37.16,000 --> 0:21:4,000
RSW: Once a shit, always a shit!

388
0:21:42.16,000 --> 0:21:45,000
FG: Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody, so ...

389
0:21:45.16,000 --> 0:21:47,000
RSW: You're going to get one! You're going to get one!

390
0:21:47.16,000 --> 0:21:48,000
(Laughter)

391
0:21:48.16,000 --> 0:21:5,000
I'm going to make it for you!

392
0:21:50.16,000 --> 0:21:51,000
FG: No, no. Wait a minute!

393
0:21:51.16,000 --> 0:21:53,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
This cell phone

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
started its trajectory

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in an artisanal mine

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
in the Eastern Congo.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It's mined by armed gangs

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
using slaves, child slaves,

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
what the U.N. Security Council

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
calls "blood minerals,"

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
then traveled into some components

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and ended up in a factory

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
in Shinjin in China.

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
That factory -- over a dozen people have committed suicide

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
already this year.

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
One man died after working a 36-hour shift.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We all love chocolate.

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We buy it for our kids.

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Eighty percent of the cocoa comes from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and it's harvested by children.

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
Cote d'Ivoire, we have a huge problem of child slaves.

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Children have been trafficked from other conflict zones

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
to come and work on the coffee plantations.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Heparin -- a blood thinner,

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
a pharmaceutical product --

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
starts out in artisanal workshops

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
like this in China,

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
because the active ingredient

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
comes from pigs' intestines.

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Your diamond -- you've all heard, probably seen the movie "Blood Diamond."

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
This is a mine in Zimbabwe

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
right now.

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Cotton: Uzbekistan is the second biggest

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
exporter of cotton on Earth.

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Every year when it comes to the cotton harvest,

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
the government shuts down the schools,

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
puts the kids in buses, buses them to the cotton fields

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to spend three weeks harvesting the cotton.

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It's forced child labor

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
on an institutional scale.

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And all of those products probably end their lives

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in a dump like this one in Manila.

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
These places, these origins,

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
represent governance gaps.

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
That's the politest description

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I have for them.

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
These are the dark pools

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
where global supply chains begin --

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
the global supply chains,

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
which bring us our favorite brand name products.

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Some of these governance gaps

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
are run by rogue states.

51
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Some of them are not states anymore at all.

52
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
They're failed states.

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Some of them

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
are just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
is the best way to attract investment,

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
promote trade.

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Either way, they present us

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
with a huge moral and ethical dilemma.

59
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I know that none of us want to be accessories

60
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
after the fact

61
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
of a human rights abuse

62
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in a global supply chain.

63
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But right now,

64
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
most of the companies involved in these supply chains

65
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
don't have any way

66
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
of assuring us

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that nobody had to mortgage their future,

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
nobody had to sacrifice their rights

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to bring us our favorite

70
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
brand name product.

71
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Now, I didn't come here to depress you

72
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
about the state of the global supply chain.

73
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We need a reality check.

74
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We need to recognize just how serious

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
a deficit of rights we have.

76
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
This is an independent republic,

77
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
probably a failed state.

78
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It's definitely not a democratic state.

79
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And right now,

80
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that independent republic of the supply chain

81
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
is not being governed

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
in a way that would satisfy us,

83
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption.

84
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Now, that's not a new story.

85
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
You've seen the documentaries

86
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
of sweatshops making garments

87
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
all over the world, even in developed countries.

88
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
You want to see the classic sweatshop,

89
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
meet me at Madison Square Garden,

90
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I'll take you down the street, and I'll show you a Chinese sweatshop.

91
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But take the example of heparin.

92
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It's a pharmaceutical product.

93
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
You expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital,

94
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
probably squeaky clean.

95
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The problem is that the active ingredient in there --

96
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
as I mentioned earlier --

97
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
comes from pigs.

98
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
The main American manufacturer

99
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
of that active ingredient

100
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
decided a few years ago to relocate to China

101
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
because it's the world's biggest supplier of pigs.

102
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And their factory in China --

103
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
which probably is pretty clean --

104
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is getting all of the ingredients

105
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
from backyard abattoirs,

106
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
where families slaughter pigs

107
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and extract the ingredient.

108
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So a couple of years ago, we had a scandal

109
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
which killed about 80 people around the world,

110
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
because of contaminants

111
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that crept into the heparin supply chain.

112
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Worse, some of the suppliers

113
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
realized that they could substitute a product

114
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
which mimicked heparin in tests.

115
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
This substitute cost nine dollars a pound,

116
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
whereas real heparin, the real ingredient,

117
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
cost 900 dollars a pound.

118
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
A no-brainer.

119
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The problem was that it killed more people.

120
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And so you're asking yourself,

121
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
"How come the U.S. Food and Drug Administration

122
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
allowed this to happen?

123
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
How did the Chinese State Agency for Food and Drugs

124
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
allow this to happen?"

125
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And the answer is quite simple:

126
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the Chinese define these facilities

127
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
as chemical facilities, not pharmaceutical facilities,

128
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
so they don't audit them.

129
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And the USFDA

130
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
has a jurisdictional problem.

131
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
This is offshore.

132
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
They actually do conduct a few investigations overseas --

133
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
about a dozen a year -- maybe 20 in a good year.

134
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
There are 500

135
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
of these facilities

136
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
producing active ingredients in China alone.

137
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
In fact, about 80 percent

138
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
of the active ingredients in medicines now

139
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
come from offshore,

140
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
particularly China and India,

141
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and we don't have a governance system.

142
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
We don't have a regulatory system

143
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
able to ensure

144
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that that production is safe.

145
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We don't have a system to ensure

146
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that human rights, basic dignity,

147
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
are ensured.

148
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So at a national level --

149
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and we work in about 60 different countries --

150
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
at a national level

151
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
we've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments

152
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
to regulate production

153
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
on their own soil.

154
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And the real problem with the global supply chain

155
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
is that it's supranational.

156
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So governments who are failing,

157
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
who are dropping the ball

158
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
at a national level,

159
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
have even less ability to get their arms around the problem

160
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
at an international level.

161
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And you can just look at the headlines.

162
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Take Copenhagen last year --

163
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
complete failure of governments

164
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
to do the right thing

165
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
in the face of an international challenge.

166
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Take the G20 meeting a couple of weeks ago --

167
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
stepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago.

168
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
You can take any one

169
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
of the major global challenges we've discussed this week

170
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and ask yourself, where is the leadership from governments

171
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
to step up and come up with solutions,

172
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
responses,

173
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to those international problems?

174
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And the simple answer is they can't. They're national.

175
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Their voters are local.

176
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
They have parochial interests.

177
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
They can't subordinate those interests

178
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to the greater global public good.

179
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So, if we're going to ensure the delivery

180
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
of the key public goods

181
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
at an international level --

182
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
in this case, in the global supply chain --

183
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
we have to come up with a different mechanism.

184
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We need a different machine.

185
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Fortunately, we have some examples.

186
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
In the 1990s,

187
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
there were a whole series of scandals

188
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
concerning the production of brand name goods in the U.S. --

189
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
child labor, forced labor,

190
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
serious health and safety abuses.

191
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And eventually President Clinton, in 1996,

192
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
convened a meeting at the White House,

193
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
invited industry, human rights NGOs,

194
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
trade unions, the Department of Labor,

195
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
got them all in a room

196
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and said, "Look,

197
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I don't want globalization to be a race to the bottom.

198
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I don't know how to prevent that,

199
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
but I'm at least going to use my good offices

200
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
to get you folks together

201
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
to come up with a response."

202
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So they formed a White House task force,

203
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and they spent about three years arguing

204
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
about who takes how much responsibility

205
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
in the global supply chain.

206
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Companies didn't feel it was their responsibility.

207
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
They don't own those facilities.

208
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
They don't employ those workers.

209
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
They're not legally liable.

210
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Everybody else at the table

211
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
said, "Folks, that doesn't cut it.

212
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
You have a custodial duty, a duty of care,

213
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to make sure that that product

214
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
gets from wherever to the store

215
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
in a way that allows us to consume it,

216
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
without fear of our safety,

217
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
or without having to sacrifice our conscience

218
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to consume that product."

219
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So they agreed, "Okay, what we'll do

220
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
is we agree on a common set of standards,

221
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
code of conduct.

222
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We'll apply that throughout

223
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
our global supply chain

224
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
regardless of ownership or control.

225
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
We'll make it part of the contract."

226
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And that was a stroke of absolute genius,

227
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
because what they did

228
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
was they harnessed the power of the contract,

229
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
private power,

230
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to deliver public goods.

231
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And let's face it,

232
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
the contract from a major multinational brand

233
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to a supplier in India or China

234
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
has much more persuasive value

235
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
than the local labor law,

236
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
the local environmental regulations,

237
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
the local human rights standards.

238
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Those factories will probably never see an inspector.

239
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
If the inspector did come along,

240
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
it would be amazing if they were able

241
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to resist the bribe.

242
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Even if they did their jobs,

243
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and they cited those facilities for their violations,

244
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
the fine would be derisory.

245
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
But you lose that contract

246
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
for a major brand name,

247
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that's the difference

248
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
between staying in business or going bankrupt.

249
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
That makes a difference.

250
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So what we've been able to do

251
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
is we've been able to harness

252
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
the power and the influence

253
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
of the only truly transnational institution

254
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
in the global supply chain,

255
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that of the multinational company,

256
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and get them to do the right thing,

257
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
get them to use that power for good,

258
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to deliver the key public goods.

259
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Now of course, this doesn't come naturally

260
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
to multinational companies.

261
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
They weren't set up to do this. They're set up to make money.

262
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
But they are extremely efficient organizations.

263
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
They have resources,

264
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and if we can add the will, the commitment,

265
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
they know how to deliver that product.

266
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Now, getting there is not easy.

267
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Those supply chains I put up on the screen earlier,

268
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
they're not there.

269
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
You need a safe space.

270
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
You need a place where people can come together,

271
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
sit down without fear of judgment,

272
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
without recrimination,

273
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to actually face the problem,

274
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
agree on the problem and come up with solutions.

275
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
We can do it. The technical solutions are there.

276
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
The problem is the lack of trust, the lack of confidence,

277
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
the lack of partnership

278
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
between NGOs, campaign groups,

279
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
civil society organizations

280
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and multinational companies.

281
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
If we can put those two together in a safe space,

282
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
get them to work together,

283
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
we can deliver public goods right now,

284
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
or in extremely short supply.

285
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
This is a radical proposition,

286
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and it's crazy to think

287
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that if you're a 15-year-old Bangladeshi girl

288
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
leaving your rural village

289
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to go and work in a factory in Dhaka --

290
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
22, 23, 24 dollars a month --

291
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
your best chance of enjoying rights at work

292
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
is if that factory is producing

293
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
for a brand name company

294
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
which has got a code of conduct

295
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and made that code of conduct part of the contract.

296
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
It's crazy.

297
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Multinationals are protecting human rights.

298
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
I know there's going to be disbelief.

299
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
You'll say, "How can we trust them?"

300
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Well, we don't.

301
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
It's the old arms control phrase:

302
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
"Trust, but verify."

303
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So we audit.

304
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
We take their supply chain, we take all the factory names,

305
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
we do a random sample,

306
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
we send inspectors on an unannounced basis

307
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
to inspect those facilities,

308
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and then we publish the results.

309
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Transparency is absolutely critical to this.

310
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
You can call yourself responsible,

311
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
but responsibility without accountability

312
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
often doesn't work.

313
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So what we're doing is, we're not only enlisting the multinationals,

314
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
we're giving them the tools to deliver this public good --

315
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
respect for human rights --

316
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and we're checking.

317
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
You don't need to believe me. You shouldn't believe me.

318
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Go to the website. Look at the audit results.

319
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Ask yourself, is this company behaving

320
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
in a socially responsible way?

321
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Can I buy that product

322
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
without compromising my ethics?

323
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
That's the way the system works.

324
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
I hate the idea

325
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
that governments are not protecting human rights around the world.

326
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I hate the idea

327
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
that governments have dropped this ball

328
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and I can't get used to the idea

329
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
that somehow we can't get them to do their jobs.

330
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
I've been at this for 30 years,

331
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and in that time I've seen

332
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
the ability, the commitment, the will of government

333
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
to do this decline,

334
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and I don't see them making a comeback right now.

335
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
So we started out thinking

336
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
this was a stopgap measure.

337
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
We're now thinking that, in fact,

338
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
this is probably the start

339
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
of a new way of regulating and addressing

340
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
international challenges.

341
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Call it network governance. Call it what you will.

342
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
The private actors,

343
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
companies and NGOs,

344
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
are going to have to get together

345
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
to face the major challenges we are going to face.

346
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Just look at pandemics --

347
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
swine flu, bird flu, H1N1.

348
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Look at the health systems in so many countries.

349
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Do they have the resources

350
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
to face up to a serious pandemic?

351
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
No.

352
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Could the private sector and NGOs

353
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
get together and marshal a response?

354
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Absolutely.

355
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
What they lack is that safe space

356
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
to come together, agree

357
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and move to action.

358
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
That's what we're trying to provide.

359
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
I know as well

360
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
that this often seems

361
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
like an overwhelming level of responsibility

362
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
for people to assume.

363
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
"You want me to deliver human rights

364
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
throughout my global supply chain.

365
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
There are thousands of suppliers in there."

366
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
It seems too daunting, too dangerous,

367
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
for any company to take on.

368
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
But there are companies.

369
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
We have 4,000 companies who are members.

370
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Some of them are very, very large companies.

371
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
The sporting goods industry, in particular,

372
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
stepped up to the plate and have done it.

373
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
The example, the role model, is there.

374
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And whenever we discuss

375
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
one of these problems that we have to address --

376
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
child labor in cottonseed farms in India --

377
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
this year we will monitor 50,000 cottonseed farms in India.

378
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
It seems overwhelming.

379
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
The numbers just make you want to zone out.

380
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
But we break it down to some basic realities.

381
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And human rights

382
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
comes down to a very simple proposition:

383
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
can I give this person their dignity back?

384
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Poor people,

385
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
people whose human rights have been violated --

386
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
the crux of that

387
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
is the loss of dignity,

388
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
the lack of dignity.

389
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
It starts with just giving people back their dignity.

390
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
I was sitting in a slum outside Gurgaon

391
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
just next to Delhi,

392
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
one of the flashiest, brightest new cities

393
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
popping up in India right now,

394
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and I was talking to workers

395
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
who worked in garment sweatshops down the road,

396
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and I asked them what message they would like me to take to the brands.

397
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
They didn't say money.

398
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
They said, "The people who employ us

399
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
treat us like we are less than human,

400
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
like we don't exist.

401
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Please ask them to treat us like human beings."

402
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
That's my simple understanding of human rights.

403
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
That's my simple proposition to you,

404
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
my simple plea to every decision-maker

405
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
in this room, everybody out there.

406
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
We can all make a decision

407
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
to come together

408
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and pick up the balls and run with the balls

409
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
that governments have dropped.

410
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
If we don't do it,

411
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
we're abandoning hope,

412
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
we're abandoning our essential humanity,

413
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
and I know that's not a place we want to be,

414
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
and we don't have to be there.

415
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
So I appeal to you.

416
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Join us, come into that safe space,

417
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
and let's start to make this happen.

418
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Thank you very much.

419
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
(Applause)

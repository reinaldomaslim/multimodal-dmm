1
0:00:12.6,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When you come to TEDx, you always think about technology,

2
0:00:15.32,000 --> 0:00:17,000
the world changing, becoming more innovative.

3
0:00:17.68,000 --> 0:00:18,000
You think about the driverless.

4
0:00:19.48,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Everyone's talking about driverless cars these days,

5
0:00:22.92,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and I love the concept of a driverless car,

6
0:00:26.04,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but when I go in one, you know,

7
0:00:29.56,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I want it really slow,

8
0:00:32.24,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I want access to the steering wheel and the brake, just in case.

9
0:00:37.72,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I don't know about you, but I am not ready for a driverless bus.

10
0:00:42.56,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I am not ready for a driverless airplane.

11
0:00:46.52,000 --> 0:00:48,000
How about a driverless world?

12
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And I ask you that

13
0:00:52.44,000 --> 0:00:54,000
because we are increasingly in one.

14
0:00:56.8,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It's not supposed to be that way.

15
0:00:58.8,000 --> 0:00:59,000
We're number one,

16
0:01:00.6,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the United States is large and in charge.

17
0:01:04.52,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Americanization and globalization for the last several generations

18
0:01:09.36,000 --> 0:01:11,000
have basically been the same thing.

19
0:01:12.04,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Right? Whether it's the World Trade Organization

20
0:01:15.88,000 --> 0:01:17,000
or it's the IMF, the World Bank,

21
0:01:18.24,000 --> 0:01:19,000
the Bretton Woods Accord on currency,

22
0:01:20.1,000 --> 0:01:21,000
these were American institutions,

23
0:01:21.88,000 --> 0:01:25,000
our values, our friends, our allies, our money, our standards.

24
0:01:26.52,000 --> 0:01:29,000
That was the way the world worked.

25
0:01:30.28,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So it's sort of interesting, if you want to look at how the US looks,

26
0:01:35.2,000 --> 0:01:36,000
here it is.

27
0:01:36.44,000 --> 0:01:39,000
This is our view of how the world is run.

28
0:01:39.76,000 --> 0:01:41,000
President Obama has got the red carpet,

29
0:01:42.6,000 --> 0:01:43,000
he goes down Air Force One,

30
0:01:44.44,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and it feels pretty good, it feels pretty comfortable.

31
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Well, I don't know how many of you saw the China trip last week

32
0:01:50.64,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and the G20.

33
0:01:52.72,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Oh my God. Right?

34
0:01:54.96,000 --> 0:01:55,000
This is how we landed

35
0:01:56.64,000 --> 0:01:59,000
for the most important meeting of the world's leaders in China.

36
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
The National Security Advisor was actually spewing expletives

37
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
on the tarmac --

38
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:07,000
no red carpet,

39
0:02:07.44,000 --> 0:02:09,000
kind of left out the bottom of the plane

40
0:02:10.12,000 --> 0:02:12,000
along with all the media and everybody else.

41
0:02:13.92,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Later on in the G20,

42
0:02:15.92,000 --> 0:02:16,000
well, there's Obama.

43
0:02:18.36,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:19.72,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Hi, George.

45
0:02:21.36,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Hi, Norman.

46
0:02:24.48,000 --> 0:02:27,000
They look like they're about to get into a cage match, right?

47
0:02:28.24,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And they did. It was 90 minutes long, and they talked about Syria.

48
0:02:31.36,000 --> 0:02:32,000
That's what Putin wanted to talk about.

49
0:02:33.28,000 --> 0:02:34,000
He's increasingly calling the shots.

50
0:02:35.04,000 --> 0:02:37,000
He's the one willing to do stuff there.

51
0:02:37.68,000 --> 0:02:41,000
There's not a lot of mutual like or trust,

52
0:02:41.88,000 --> 0:02:43,000
but it's not as if the Americans are telling him what to do.

53
0:02:44.76,000 --> 0:02:46,000
How about when the whole 20 are getting together?

54
0:02:47.12,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Surely, when the leaders are all onstage,

55
0:02:49.097,000 --> 0:02:51,000
then the Americans are pulling their weight.

56
0:02:51.2,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Uh-oh.

57
0:02:52.64,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Laughter)

58
0:02:55.76,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Xi Jinping seems fine.

59
0:02:58.88,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Angela Merkel has -- she always does --

60
0:03:00.8,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that look, she always does that.

61
0:03:03.2,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But Putin is telling Turkish president Erdogan what to do,

62
0:03:06.24,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and Obama is like, what's going on over there?

63
0:03:11.84,000 --> 0:03:14,000
You see. And the problem is it's not a G20,

64
0:03:15.2,000 --> 0:03:16,000
the problem is

65
0:03:16.44,000 --> 0:03:18,000
it's a G-Zero world that we live in,

66
0:03:19.44,000 --> 0:03:23,000
a world order where there is no single country or alliance

67
0:03:23.88,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that can meet the challenges of global leadership.

68
0:03:27.28,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The G20 doesn't work,

69
0:03:29.88,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the G7, all of our friends, that's history.

70
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So globalization is continuing.

71
0:03:36.4,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Goods and services and people and capital are moving across borders

72
0:03:40.08,000 --> 0:03:42,000
faster and faster than ever before,

73
0:03:42.12,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but Americanization is not.

74
0:03:45.84,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So if I've convinced you of that,

75
0:03:47.48,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I want to do two things with the rest of this talk.

76
0:03:50.24,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I want to talk about the implications of that

77
0:03:53.72,000 --> 0:03:54,000
for the whole world.

78
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I'll go around it.

79
0:03:56.56,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And then I want to talk about

80
0:03:58.2,000 --> 0:04:,000
what we think right here

81
0:04:01.12,000 --> 0:04:04,000
in the United States and in New York.

82
0:04:04.56,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So why? What are the implications. Why are we here?

83
0:04:07.2,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Well, we're here

84
0:04:09.04,000 --> 0:04:12,000
because the United States,

85
0:04:12.44,000 --> 0:04:15,000
we spent two trillion dollars on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan

86
0:04:16.28,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that were failed.

87
0:04:17.52,000 --> 0:04:18,000
We don't want to do that anymore.

88
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
We have large numbers of middle and working classes

89
0:04:22.84,000 --> 0:04:26,000
that feel like they've not benefited from promises of globalization,

90
0:04:26.96,000 --> 0:04:28,000
so they don't want to see it particularly.

91
0:04:29.64,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And we have an energy revolution

92
0:04:32.32,000 --> 0:04:35,000
where we don't need OPEC or the Middle East the way we used to.

93
0:04:35.52,000 --> 0:04:37,000
We produce all that right here in the United States.

94
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So the Americans don't want to be the global sheriff for security

95
0:04:43.36,000 --> 0:04:45,000
or the architect of global trade.

96
0:04:45.68,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The Americans don't want to even be the cheerleader of global values.

97
0:04:49.12,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Well, then you look to Europe,

98
0:04:52.8,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and the most important alliance in the world

99
0:04:54.92,000 --> 0:04:56,000
has been the transatlantic relationship.

100
0:04:57.68,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But it is now weaker than it has been at any point since World War II,

101
0:05:02.08,000 --> 0:05:04,000
all of the crises, the Brexit conversations,

102
0:05:04.68,000 --> 0:05:08,000
the hedging going on between the French and the Russians,

103
0:05:08.8,000 --> 0:05:11,000
or the Germans and the Turks, or the Brits and the Chinese.

104
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:14,000
China does want to do more leadership.

105
0:05:14.96,000 --> 0:05:17,000
They do, but only in the economic sphere,

106
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and they want their own values, standards, currency,

107
0:05:21.12,000 --> 0:05:23,000
in competition with that of the US.

108
0:05:23.24,000 --> 0:05:24,000
The Russians want to do more leadership.

109
0:05:25.2,000 --> 0:05:27,000
You see that in Ukraine,

110
0:05:27.28,000 --> 0:05:29,000
in the Baltic states, in the Middle East,

111
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but not with the Americans.

112
0:05:31.92,000 --> 0:05:33,000
They want their own preferences and order.

113
0:05:34.56,000 --> 0:05:36,000
That's why we are where we are.

114
0:05:37.48,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So what happens going forward?

115
0:05:40.8,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Let's start easy,

116
0:05:42.96,000 --> 0:05:43,000
with the Middle East.

117
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
(Laughter)

118
0:05:48.56,000 --> 0:05:5,000
You know, I left a little out,

119
0:05:51.2,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but you get the general idea.

120
0:05:54.56,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Look, there are three reasons

121
0:05:56,000 --> 0:06:01,000
why the Middle East has had stability such as it is. Right?

122
0:06:01.08,000 --> 0:06:05,000
One is because there was a willingness to provide

123
0:06:05.2,000 --> 0:06:08,000
some level of military security by the US and allies.

124
0:06:08.6,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Number two, it was easy to take a lot of cheap money out of the ground

125
0:06:13.28,000 --> 0:06:14,000
because oil was expensive.

126
0:06:15.08,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And number three

127
0:06:16.44,000 --> 0:06:21,000
was no matter how bad the leaders were, the populations were relatively quiescent.

128
0:06:21.56,000 --> 0:06:23,000
They didn't have the ability, and many didn't have the will

129
0:06:24.36,000 --> 0:06:25,000
to really rise up against.

130
0:06:25.84,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Well, I can tell you, in a G-Zero world,

131
0:06:28.4,000 --> 0:06:31,000
all three of those things are increasingly not true,

132
0:06:32.04,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and so failed states,

133
0:06:34.4,000 --> 0:06:37,000
terrorism, refugees and the rest.

134
0:06:37.64,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Does the entire Middle East fall apart?

135
0:06:39.6,000 --> 0:06:42,000
No, the Kurds will do better, and Iraq, Israel, Iran over time.

136
0:06:43.48,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But generally speaking, it's not a good look.

137
0:06:45.88,000 --> 0:06:48,000
OK, how about this guy?

138
0:06:49.28,000 --> 0:06:51,000
He's playing a poor hand very well.

139
0:06:51.76,000 --> 0:06:53,000
There's no question he's hitting above his weight.

140
0:06:54.68,000 --> 0:06:57,000
But long term -- I didn't mean that.

141
0:06:57.96,000 --> 0:07:01,000
But long term, long term,

142
0:07:02.28,000 --> 0:07:03,000
if you think that the Russians

143
0:07:03.96,000 --> 0:07:08,000
were antagonized by the US and Europe expanding NATO right up to their borders

144
0:07:09.6,000 --> 0:07:1,000
when we said they weren't going to,

145
0:07:11.27,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and the EU encroaching them,

146
0:07:13.68,000 --> 0:07:16,000
just wait until the Chinese put hundreds of billions of dollars

147
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
in every country around Russia they thought they had influence in.

148
0:07:20.32,000 --> 0:07:23,000
The Chinese are going to dominate it. The Russians are picking up the crumbs.

149
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:3,000
In a G-Zero world, this is going to be a very tense 10 years for Mr. Putin.

150
0:07:33.04,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It's not all bad. Right?

151
0:07:35.72,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Asia actually looks a lot better.

152
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:41,000
There are real leaders across Asia,

153
0:07:41.2,000 --> 0:07:43,000
they have a lot of political stability.

154
0:07:43.6,000 --> 0:07:44,000
They're there for a while.

155
0:07:44.88,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Mr. Modi in India,

156
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Mr. Abe, who is probably about to get a third term written in

157
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
in the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan,

158
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
of course Xi Jinping who is consolidating enormous power,

159
0:07:56.32,000 --> 0:07:58,000
the most powerful leader in China

160
0:07:58.68,000 --> 0:07:59,000
since Mao.

161
0:08:00.36,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Those are the three most important economies in Asia.

162
0:08:03.6,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Now look, there are problems in Asia.

163
0:08:05.44,000 --> 0:08:07,000
We see the sparring over the South China Sea.

164
0:08:08.12,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We see that Kim Jong Un, just in the last couple of days,

165
0:08:10.84,000 --> 0:08:13,000
tested yet another nuclear weapon.

166
0:08:14.04,000 --> 0:08:18,000
But the leaders in Asia do not feel the need

167
0:08:18.32,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to wave the flag,

168
0:08:19.88,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to go xenophobic,

169
0:08:21.72,000 --> 0:08:24,000
to actually allow escalation

170
0:08:24.8,000 --> 0:08:26,000
of the geopolitical and cross-border tensions.

171
0:08:27.32,000 --> 0:08:32,000
They want to focus on long-term economic stability and growth.

172
0:08:32.72,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And that's what they're actually doing.

173
0:08:35.6,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Let's turn to Europe.

174
0:08:38.32,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Europe does look a little scared in this environment.

175
0:08:40.92,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So much of what is happening in the Middle East

176
0:08:43.24,000 --> 0:08:47,000
is washing up quite literally onto European shores.

177
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:51,000
You see Brexit and you see the concerns of populism

178
0:08:51.799,000 --> 0:08:54,000
across all of the European states.

179
0:08:55.4,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Let me tell you that over the long term,

180
0:08:58.08,000 --> 0:08:59,000
in a G-Zero world,

181
0:08:59.88,000 --> 0:09:02,000
European expansion will be seen to have gone too far.

182
0:09:04.52,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Europe went right up to Russia, went right down to the Middle East,

183
0:09:08.32,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and if the world were truly becoming more flat and more Americanized,

184
0:09:12.6,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that would be less of a problem,

185
0:09:14.2,000 --> 0:09:17,000
but in a G-Zero world, those countries nearest Russia

186
0:09:17.72,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and nearest the Middle East

187
0:09:19.36,000 --> 0:09:22,000
actually have different economic capabilities,

188
0:09:22.76,000 --> 0:09:23,000
different social stability

189
0:09:24.6,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and different political preferences and systems than core Europe.

190
0:09:28.8,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So Europe was able to truly expand

191
0:09:31.84,000 --> 0:09:33,000
under the G7,

192
0:09:33.92,000 --> 0:09:35,000
but under the G-Zero, Europe will get smaller.

193
0:09:36.48,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Core Europe around Germany and France and others

194
0:09:40.52,000 --> 0:09:44,000
will still work, be functional, stable, wealthy, integrated.

195
0:09:44.6,000 --> 0:09:45,000
But the periphery,

196
0:09:46.04,000 --> 0:09:48,000
countries like Greece and Turkey and others,

197
0:09:48.52,000 --> 0:09:5,000
will not look that good at all.

198
0:09:52.2,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Latin America, a lot of populism,

199
0:09:55.6,000 --> 0:09:57,000
made the economies not go so well.

200
0:09:57.64,000 --> 0:09:59,000
They had been more opposed to the United States for decades.

201
0:10:00.52,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Increasingly, they're coming back.

202
0:10:02.48,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We see that in Argentina.

203
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We see it with the openness in Cuba.

204
0:10:05.92,000 --> 0:10:08,000
We will see it in Venezuela when Maduro falls.

205
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
We will see it in Brazil after the impeachment

206
0:10:12.2,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and when we finally see a new legitimate president elected there.

207
0:10:16.72,000 --> 0:10:19,000
The only place you see that is moving in another direction

208
0:10:19.84,000 --> 0:10:22,000
is the unpopularity of Mexican president Peña Nieto.

209
0:10:23.44,000 --> 0:10:26,000
There you could actually see a slip away from the United States

210
0:10:27.32,000 --> 0:10:28,000
over the coming years.

211
0:10:28.6,000 --> 0:10:31,000
The US election matters a lot on that one, too.

212
0:10:31.64,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Laughter)

213
0:10:33.6,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Africa, right?

214
0:10:35.44,000 --> 0:10:38,000
A lot of people have said it's going to be Africa's decade, finally.

215
0:10:38.68,000 --> 0:10:41,000
In a G-Zero world, it is absolutely an amazing time

216
0:10:42.24,000 --> 0:10:43,000
for a few African countries,

217
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:46,000
those governed well with a lot of urbanization,

218
0:10:46.68,000 --> 0:10:49,000
a lot of smart people, women really getting into the workforce,

219
0:10:50.2,000 --> 0:10:51,000
entrepreneurship taking off.

220
0:10:52.2,000 --> 0:10:54,000
But for most of the countries in Africa,

221
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:56,000
it's going to be a lot more dicey:

222
0:10:56.92,000 --> 0:10:59,000
extreme climate conditions,

223
0:10:59.96,000 --> 0:11:03,000
radicalism both from Islam and also Christianity,

224
0:11:04.2,000 --> 0:11:05,000
very poor governance,

225
0:11:05.64,000 --> 0:11:08,000
borders you can't defend, lots of forced migration.

226
0:11:08.68,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Those countries can fall off the map.

227
0:11:10.8,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So you're really going to see an extreme segregation going on

228
0:11:14.56,000 --> 0:11:17,000
between the winners and the losers across Africa.

229
0:11:17.92,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Finally, back to the United States.

230
0:11:21.84,000 --> 0:11:23,000
What do I think about us?

231
0:11:24.48,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Because there are a lot of upset people,

232
0:11:27.24,000 --> 0:11:29,000
not here at TEDx, I know,

233
0:11:29.92,000 --> 0:11:3,000
but in the United States, my God,

234
0:11:31.72,000 --> 0:11:33,000
after 15 months of campaigning, we should be upset.

235
0:11:34.2,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I understand that.

236
0:11:36.2,000 --> 0:11:39,000
But a lot of people are upset because they say, "Washington's broken,

237
0:11:39.48,000 --> 0:11:41,000
we don't trust the establishment, we hate the media."

238
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Heck, even globalists like me are taking it on the chin.

239
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Look, I do think we have to recognize,

240
0:11:50.8,000 --> 0:11:52,000
my fellow campers,

241
0:11:53.04,000 --> 0:11:57,000
that when you are being chased by the bear,

242
0:11:57.48,000 --> 0:12:01,000
in the global context, you need not outrun the bear,

243
0:12:01.8,000 --> 0:12:03,000
you need to only outrun your fellow campers.

244
0:12:04.44,000 --> 0:12:06,000
(Laughter)

245
0:12:07.72,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Now, I just told you

246
0:12:09.88,000 --> 0:12:11,000
about our fellow campers.

247
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Right? And from that perspective,

248
0:12:14.96,000 --> 0:12:16,000
we look OK.

249
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:19,000
A lot of people in that context say,

250
0:12:19.04,000 --> 0:12:22,000
"Let's go dollar. Let's go New York real estate.

251
0:12:22.56,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Let's send our kids to American universities."

252
0:12:25.64,000 --> 0:12:27,000
You know, our neighbors are awesome:

253
0:12:27.8,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Canada, Mexico and two big bodies of water.

254
0:12:30.68,000 --> 0:12:34,000
You know how much Turkey would love to have neighbors like that?

255
0:12:35.08,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Those are awesome neighbors.

256
0:12:38.4,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Terrorism is a problem in the United States.

257
0:12:40.72,000 --> 0:12:43,000
God knows we know it here in New York.

258
0:12:44.04,000 --> 0:12:46,000
But it's a much bigger problem in Europe than the US.

259
0:12:46.541,000 --> 0:12:48,000
It's a much bigger problem in the Middle East

260
0:12:48.88,000 --> 0:12:49,000
than it is in Europe.

261
0:12:50.48,000 --> 0:12:52,000
These are factors of large magnitude.

262
0:12:52.64,000 --> 0:12:56,000
We just accepted 10,000 Syrian refugees, and we're complaining bitterly about it.

263
0:12:57.64,000 --> 0:12:59,000
You know why? Because they can't swim here.

264
0:13:00.48,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Right? I mean, the Turks would love to have only 10,000 Syrian refugees.

265
0:13:05.2,000 --> 0:13:08,000
The Jordanians, the Germans, the Brits. Right?

266
0:13:08.52,000 --> 0:13:09,000
That's not the situation.

267
0:13:09.8,000 --> 0:13:12,000
That's the reality of the United States.

268
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Now, that sounds pretty good.

269
0:13:16.44,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Here's the challenge.

270
0:13:18.6,000 --> 0:13:21,000
In a G-Zero world, the way you lead

271
0:13:22.64,000 --> 0:13:23,000
is by example.

272
0:13:24.24,000 --> 0:13:27,000
If we know we don't want to be the global cop anymore,

273
0:13:27.28,000 --> 0:13:29,000
if we know we're not going to be the architect of global trade,

274
0:13:30.257,000 --> 0:13:32,000
we're not going to be the cheerleader of global values,

275
0:13:32.88,000 --> 0:13:34,000
we're not going to do it the way we used to,

276
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:36,000
the 21st century is changing,

277
0:13:36.405,000 --> 0:13:38,000
we need to lead by example -- be so compelling

278
0:13:39.28,000 --> 0:13:41,000
that all these other people are going to still say,

279
0:13:41.72,000 --> 0:13:42,000
it's not just they're faster campers.

280
0:13:43.56,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Even when the bear is not chasing us, this is a good place to be.

281
0:13:46.68,000 --> 0:13:47,000
We want to emulate them.

282
0:13:48.88,000 --> 0:13:52,000
The election process this year is not proving a good option

283
0:13:54.04,000 --> 0:13:55,000
for leading by example.

284
0:13:56.64,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Hillary Clinton says it's going to be like the '90s.

285
0:13:59.12,000 --> 0:14:01,000
We can still be that cheerleader on values.

286
0:14:02.08,000 --> 0:14:04,000
We can still be the architect of global trade.

287
0:14:04.6,000 --> 0:14:05,000
We can still be the global sheriff.

288
0:14:06.32,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And Donald Trump wants to bring us back to the '30s.

289
0:14:10.56,000 --> 0:14:13,000
He's saying, "Our way or the highway. You don't like it, lump it." Right?

290
0:14:14.52,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Neither are recognizing a fundamental truth of the G-Zero,

291
0:14:18.4,000 --> 0:14:21,000
which is that even though the US is not in decline,

292
0:14:22.2,000 --> 0:14:24,000
it is getting objectively harder

293
0:14:24.76,000 --> 0:14:27,000
for the Americans to impose their will,

294
0:14:27.96,000 --> 0:14:28,000
even have great influence,

295
0:14:29.68,000 --> 0:14:31,000
on the global order.

296
0:14:32.28,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Are we prepared to truly lead by example?

297
0:14:36.2,000 --> 0:14:39,000
What would we have to do to fix this

298
0:14:39.28,000 --> 0:14:4,000
after November,

299
0:14:40.52,000 --> 0:14:42,000
after the next president comes in?

300
0:14:42.72,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Well, either we have to have another crisis that forces us to respond.

301
0:14:47.4,000 --> 0:14:48,000
A depression would do that.

302
0:14:49.08,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Another global financial crisis could do this.

303
0:14:51.28,000 --> 0:14:53,000
God forbid, another 9/11 could do that.

304
0:14:53.32,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Or, absent crisis,

305
0:14:55.8,000 --> 0:15:01,000
we need to see that the hollowing out, the inequality, the challenges

306
0:15:01.96,000 --> 0:15:03,000
that are growing and growing in the United States,

307
0:15:04.36,000 --> 0:15:06,000
are themselves urgent enough

308
0:15:06.56,000 --> 0:15:08,000
to force our leaders to change,

309
0:15:08.92,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and that we have those voices.

310
0:15:11.4,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Through our cell phones, individually,

311
0:15:13.32,000 --> 0:15:16,000
we have those voices to compel them to change.

312
0:15:17.48,000 --> 0:15:18,000
There is, of course, a third choice,

313
0:15:20.2,000 --> 0:15:21,000
perhaps the most likely one,

314
0:15:22.2,000 --> 0:15:24,000
which is that we do neither of those things,

315
0:15:24.92,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and in four years time you invite me back,

316
0:15:27.52,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and I will give this speech yet again.

317
0:15:30.32,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Thank you very, very much.

318
0:15:32.2,000 --> 0:15:35,000
(Applause)

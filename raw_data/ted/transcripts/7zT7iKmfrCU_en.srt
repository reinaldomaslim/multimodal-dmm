1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
This is a sculpture I made,

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
which is a way of, kind of, freeing a form

3
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
into an object that has different degrees of freedom.

4
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So, it can balance on a point.

5
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
This is a bronze ball,

6
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
an aluminum arm here,

7
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and then this wooden disk.

8
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And the wooden disk was really thought about

9
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
as something that you'd want to hold on to,

10
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and that would glide easily through your hands.

11
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The aluminum is because it's very light.

12
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The bronze is nice hard, durable material

13
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that could roll on the ground.

14
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Inside of the bronze ball

15
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
there's a lead weight

16
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that is free-swinging on an axle

17
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that's on two bearings

18
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that pass in between, across it,

19
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
like this, that counterbalance this weight.

20
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So it allows it to roll.

21
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And the sphere has that balance property

22
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that it always sort of stays still

23
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and looks the same from every direction.

24
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But if you put something on top of it,

25
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
it disbalances it. And so it would tip over.

26
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But in this case because

27
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the interior is free-swinging

28
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
in relation to the sphere,

29
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
it can stand up on one point.

30
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And then there was a second level to this object,

31
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
which is that it --

32
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in,

33
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
which is the diameter of the Moon

34
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and the diameter of the Earth

35
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
in proportion to each other.

36
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I was exploring, really early on,

37
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
wanting to make things float in the air.

38
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And I thought up a lot of ideas.

39
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
This is sculpture that I made that --

40
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
it's magnetically levitated.

41
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
The thing is, is that it's slightly dangerous.

42
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Normally it's sort of cordoned off when it's in a museum.

43
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But it's uh -- let's see if I can manipulate it a little bit

44
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
without, um -- oops.

45
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So this is just floating,

46
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
floating on a permanent magnetic field,

47
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
which stabilizes it in all directions.

48
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Except there is a slight tether here,

49
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
which keeps it from going over the top of its field.

50
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
It's sort of surfing on a magnetic field

51
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
at the crest of a wave.

52
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And that's what supports the object and keeps it stable.

53
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I think we could roll the tape, admin.

54
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I have a sort of a collection of videos

55
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that I took of different installations, which I could narrate.

56
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
This is a sculpture of the Sun

57
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and the Earth, in proportion.

58
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Representing that eight and a half minutes

59
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that it takes light and gravity to connect the two.

60
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So here is the Earth. It's a little less than a millimeter

61
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that was turned of solid bronze.

62
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And here is a similar sculpture.

63
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
That's the Sun at that end.

64
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And then in a series of 55 balls,

65
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
it reduces, proportionately -- each ball

66
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and the spaces between them

67
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
reduce proportionately,

68
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
until they get down to this little Earth.

69
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
This is in a sculpture park in Taejon.

70
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
This one is about the Moon

71
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and then the distance to the Earth, in proportion also.

72
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
This is a little stone ball, floating.

73
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
As you can see the little tether,

74
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that it's also magnetically levitated.

75
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And then this is the first part of --

76
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
this is 109 spheres,

77
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
since the Sun is 109 times the diameter of the Earth.

78
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And so this is the size of the Sun.

79
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And then each of these little spheres

80
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
is the size of the Earth in proportion to the Sun.

81
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It's made up of 16 concentric shells. Each one has 92 spheres.

82
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
This is in the courtyard of a twelfth-century alchemist.

83
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I was thinking that the Sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist. (Laughter)

84
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So this, again, is on the subject --

85
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
a slice from the equator of the Earth.

86
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And then the Moon in the center,

87
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and it's floating. And this is in France.

88
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
This is in Sapporo.

89
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It's balancing on a shaft and a ball,

90
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
right at the center of gravity, or just slightly above the center of gravity,

91
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
which means that the lower half of the object

92
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
is just a little bit more weighty.

93
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So you can see it rotating here.

94
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It weighs about a ton or over a ton.

95
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
It's made of stainless steel, quite thick.

96
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But it's being balanced like that in equilibrium.

97
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It's susceptible to motion by the air currents.

98
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
This is another species of work that I do.

99
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
These are these arrays. These spheres are all suspended,

100
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
but they have magnets horizontally in them

101
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that make them all like compasses.

102
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So all the red sides, for example, face one direction: south.

103
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And the blue side, the compliment, faces the other way.

104
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So as you turn around you're seeing different colors.

105
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
This is based on the structure of a diamond.

106
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It was a diamond cell structure

107
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
was the point of departure.

108
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And then there were kind of large spaces in the hollows

109
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
between the atoms.

110
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And so I placed one more element of each one of them.

111
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
These were white spheres.

112
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Then I had video projectors

113
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres.

114
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So they would catch parts of the images,

115
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and make sort of three-dimensional color volumes,

116
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
as you walk through it, through the object.

117
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
This is something I did

118
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
of a tactile communication system.

119
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture,

120
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and then putting it into a communication system.

121
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
This is an idea of moving a sculpture, a ball,

122
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that would be directed around the room

123
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
by a computer.

124
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
This is a clock I designed.

125
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It has Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion Map edited here.

126
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It turns once per day in synchrony with the Earth.

127
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And then, this is like

128
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
projects that are harder to build.

129
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Laughter)

130
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
This has a diamond-bottomed lake.

131
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So it's a floating island

132
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
with water, fresh water,

133
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that can fly from place to place.

134
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
This would be grown, I suppose,

135
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
with nanotechnology in the future sometime.

136
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
In the course of doing my work

137
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I sort of have a broad range of interests.

138
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And some of it is just the idea of creating media --

139
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
media as a sculpture,

140
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
something that would keep the sculpture

141
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
fresh and ever-changing,

142
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
by just creating the media that the sculpture is made of.

143
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And I had a lot of --

144
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
always interested in the concept of a crystal ball.

145
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And the idea that you could see things

146
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
inside of a crystal ball and predict the future --

147
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
or a television set, where it's sort of like a magic box

148
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
where anything can appear.

149
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I had thought about, a long time ago,

150
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
in the late '60s -- when I was just starting out,

151
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I was under the influence of thinking about Buckminster Fuller's

152
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
grand project for an electric globe

153
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
across from the United Nations --

154
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and other things that were happening,

155
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
the space program at that time,

156
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and Whole Earth Catalog, things like that.

157
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I was thinking about mass produced spherical television sets

158
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that could be linked to orbiting camera satellites.

159
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So if we could roll the next film here.

160
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
This has evolved over the years

161
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
in a lot of different iterations.

162
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But this the current version of it,

163
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
is a flying airship

164
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that is about 35 meters in diameter,

165
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
about 110 feet in diameter.

166
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
The whole surface of it is covered with 60 million diodes,

167
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
red, blue, and green,

168
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
that allow you to have a high-resolution picture, visible in daylight.

169
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I came with a plan.

170
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I brought it to Paul MacCready's company AeroVironment

171
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
to do a feasibility study,

172
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and they analyzed it,

173
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it.

174
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen.

175
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
This is the control room inside of the ship.

176
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The idea of this air genie is,

177
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
it's something that can just transform and become anything.

178
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
It's like a traveling show.

179
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
It has speakers on it. And it has cameras

180
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
over the surface of it.

181
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So it can see its environment,

182
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and then it can mimic its environment and disappear.

183
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Here the legs are retracting.

184
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
The cabin is open or closed, as you like.

185
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
It weighs about 20 tons.

186
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
It has on-board generators.

187
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
It can generate about a million kilowatts,

188
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
in order to be bright enough

189
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
to be visible in daylight.

190
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
The idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show.

191
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
It really would be dedicated to the arts and to interacting.

192
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
There would be on board a crew of artists, musicians,

193
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that would allow the thing to become

194
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
actually kind of a conscious object

195
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
that would respond to the moment,

196
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and to interact as an entity

197
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that was aware, that could communicate.

198
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It's completely silent and nonpolluting.

199
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
It has electric motors with a novel propulsion system.

200
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
It could be interacted with large crowds in different ways.

201
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Primarily I would be interested in

202
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
how it would interact with, say,

203
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
going to a college campus,

204
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences,

205
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
the world, the situation of the globe.

206
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The default image on the object

207
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
would probably be a high-resolution Earth image.

208
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
But then one could interact with that

209
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and show plate tectonics or global warming issues, or migrations --

210
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
all of the things that we're concerned with today.

211
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And then at night the idea is that

212
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
it would be used as kind of a rave situation,

213
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
where the people could cut loose,

214
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and the music and the lights, and everything.

215
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
So it could land in a park, for example.

216
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Or this could represent a college green.

217
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And then it would have a corresponding website

218
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that would show the itinerary of this.

219
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And so interacting with the same kind of imagery.

220
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
It would also be able to be an open code,

221
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
so people could interact with it.

222
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
It would be forum for people's ideas about

223
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
what they would like to see on a giant screen of this type.

224
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
So that's pretty much it.

225
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Okay. Thank you.

226
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.78,000 --> 0:00:13,000
For several years now,

2
0:00:14.22,000 --> 0:00:18,000
we've been engaged in a national debate about sexual assault on campus.

3
0:00:18.98,000 --> 0:00:19,000
No question --

4
0:00:20.22,000 --> 0:00:24,000
it's crucial that young people understand the ground rules for consent,

5
0:00:25.18,000 --> 0:00:28,000
but that's where the conversation about sex is ending.

6
0:00:28.86,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And in that vacuum of information

7
0:00:30.94,000 --> 0:00:31,000
the media and the Internet --

8
0:00:32.94,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that new digital street corner --

9
0:00:34.7,000 --> 0:00:36,000
are educating our kids for us.

10
0:00:38.02,000 --> 0:00:43,000
If we truly want young people to engage safely, ethically,

11
0:00:43.18,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and yes, enjoyably,

12
0:00:45.9,000 --> 0:00:5,000
it's time to have open honest discussion about what happens after "yes,"

13
0:00:52.5,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and that includes breaking the biggest taboo of all

14
0:00:55.7,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and talking to young people

15
0:00:57.46,000 --> 0:01:01,000
about women's capacity for and entitlement to sexual pleasure.

16
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Yeah.

17
0:01:04.5,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Applause)

18
0:01:05.54,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Come on, ladies.

19
0:01:06.78,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Applause)

20
0:01:08.7,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I spent three years talking to girls ages 15 to 20

21
0:01:12.54,000 --> 0:01:14,000
about their attitudes and experience of sex.

22
0:01:15.5,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And what I found was

23
0:01:16.94,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that while young women may feel entitled to engage in sexual behavior,

24
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
they don't necessarily feel entitled to enjoy it.

25
0:01:25.06,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Take this sophomore at the Ivy League college

26
0:01:27.22,000 --> 0:01:28,000
who told me,

27
0:01:28.46,000 --> 0:01:31,000
"I come from a long line of smart, strong women.

28
0:01:31.74,000 --> 0:01:33,000
My grandmother was a firecracker,

29
0:01:33.98,000 --> 0:01:34,000
my mom is a professional,

30
0:01:35.86,000 --> 0:01:38,000
my sister and I are loud, and that's our form of feminine power."

31
0:01:40.18,000 --> 0:01:42,000
She then proceeded to describe her sex life to me:

32
0:01:42.9,000 --> 0:01:44,000
a series of one-off hookups,

33
0:01:44.98,000 --> 0:01:45,000
starting when she was 13,

34
0:01:46.74,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that were ...

35
0:01:48.22,000 --> 0:01:5,000
not especially responsible,

36
0:01:50.34,000 --> 0:01:52,000
not especially reciprocal

37
0:01:52.5,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and not especially enjoyable.

38
0:01:54.9,000 --> 0:01:55,000
She shrugged.

39
0:01:56.54,000 --> 0:01:59,000
"I guess we girls are just socialized to be these docile creatures

40
0:02:00.18,000 --> 0:02:02,000
who don't express our wants or needs."

41
0:02:03.38,000 --> 0:02:04,000
"Wait a minute," I replied.

42
0:02:04.98,000 --> 0:02:07,000
"Didn't you just tell me what a smart, strong woman you are?"

43
0:02:08.82,000 --> 0:02:09,000
She hemmed and hawed.

44
0:02:10.86,000 --> 0:02:11,000
"I guess," she finally said,

45
0:02:12.74,000 --> 0:02:15,000
"no one told me that that smart, strong image applies to sex."

46
0:02:17.74,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I should probably say right up top that despite the hype,

47
0:02:20.739,000 --> 0:02:24,000
teenagers are not engaging in intercourse more often or at a younger age

48
0:02:25.66,000 --> 0:02:27,000
than they were 25 years ago.

49
0:02:27.9,000 --> 0:02:3,000
They are, however, engaging in other behavior.

50
0:02:31.58,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And when we ignore that,

51
0:02:33.18,000 --> 0:02:35,000
when we label that as "not sex,"

52
0:02:36.42,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that opens the door to risky behavior and disrespect.

53
0:02:40.86,000 --> 0:02:42,000
That's particularly true of oral sex,

54
0:02:43.42,000 --> 0:02:46,000
which teenagers consider to be less intimate than intercourse.

55
0:02:47.34,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Girls would tell me, "it's no big deal,"

56
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
like they'd all read the same instruction manual --

57
0:02:53.34,000 --> 0:02:56,000
at least if boys were on the receiving end.

58
0:02:57.42,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Young women have lots of reasons for participating.

59
0:03:00.3,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It made them feel desired;

60
0:03:02.02,000 --> 0:03:04,000
it was a way to boost social status.

61
0:03:04.62,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Sometimes, it was a way to get out of an uncomfortable situation.

62
0:03:08.38,000 --> 0:03:11,000
As a freshman at a West Coast college said to me,

63
0:03:11.46,000 --> 0:03:13,000
"A girl will give a guy a blow job at the end of the night

64
0:03:14.22,000 --> 0:03:16,000
because she doesn't want to have sex with him,

65
0:03:16.42,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and he expects to be satisfied.

66
0:03:18.54,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So, if I want him to leave

67
0:03:20.42,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and I don't want anything to happen ... "

68
0:03:24.54,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I heard so many stories of girls performing one-sided oral sex

69
0:03:28.7,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that I started asking,

70
0:03:30.74,000 --> 0:03:32,000
"What if every time you were alone with a guy,

71
0:03:33.02,000 --> 0:03:35,000
he told you to get him a glass of water from the kitchen,

72
0:03:36.02,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and he never got you a glass of water --

73
0:03:39.38,000 --> 0:03:4,000
or if he did, it was like ...

74
0:03:43.7,000 --> 0:03:44,000
'you want me to uh ...?'"

75
0:03:45.74,000 --> 0:03:46,000
You know, totally begrudging.

76
0:03:47.82,000 --> 0:03:48,000
You wouldn't stand for it.

77
0:03:50.78,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But it wasn't always that boys didn't want to.

78
0:03:53.42,000 --> 0:03:55,000
It was that girls didn't want them to.

79
0:03:56.1,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Girls expressed a sense of shame around their genitals.

80
0:03:59.3,000 --> 0:04:02,000
A sense that they were simultaneously icky and sacred.

81
0:04:04.14,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Women's feelings about their genitals

82
0:04:05.98,000 --> 0:04:08,000
have been directly linked to their enjoyment of sex.

83
0:04:09.98,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Yet, Debby Herbenick, a researcher at Indiana University,

84
0:04:13.54,000 --> 0:04:17,000
believes that girls' genital self-image is under siege,

85
0:04:18.14,000 --> 0:04:19,000
with more pressure than ever

86
0:04:19.82,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to see them as unacceptable in their natural state.

87
0:04:24.38,000 --> 0:04:25,000
According to research,

88
0:04:25.62,000 --> 0:04:29,000
about three-quarters of college women remove their pubic hair -- all of it --

89
0:04:30.06,000 --> 0:04:31,000
at least on occasion,

90
0:04:31.74,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and more than half do so regularly.

91
0:04:35.02,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Girls would tell me that hair removal made them feel cleaner,

92
0:04:39.18,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that it was a personal choice.

93
0:04:42.66,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Though, I kind of wondered if left alone on a desert island,

94
0:04:46.9,000 --> 0:04:49,000
if this was how they would choose to spend their time.

95
0:04:49.94,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:51.5,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And when I pushed further,

97
0:04:52.94,000 --> 0:04:54,000
a darker motivation emerged:

98
0:04:55.1,000 --> 0:04:56,000
avoiding humiliation.

99
0:04:57.7,000 --> 0:04:59,000
"Guys act like they would be disgusted by it,"

100
0:05:00.62,000 --> 0:05:01,000
one young woman told me.

101
0:05:02.7,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"No one wants to be talked about like that."

102
0:05:06.06,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The rising pubic hair removal reminded me of the 1920s,

103
0:05:09.5,000 --> 0:05:13,000
when women first started regularly shaving their armpits and their legs.

104
0:05:14.02,000 --> 0:05:16,000
That's when flapper dresses came into style,

105
0:05:16.58,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and women's limbs were suddenly visible,

106
0:05:19.18,000 --> 0:05:2,000
open to public scrutiny.

107
0:05:21.46,000 --> 0:05:23,000
There's a way that I think that this too is a sign.

108
0:05:24.46,000 --> 0:05:27,000
That a girl's most intimate part is open to public scrutiny,

109
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
open to critique,

110
0:05:30.98,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to becoming more about how it looks to someone else

111
0:05:34.5,000 --> 0:05:36,000
than how it feels to her.

112
0:05:37.82,000 --> 0:05:4,000
The shaving trend has sparked another rise in labiaplasty.

113
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Labiaplasty, which is the trimming of the inner and outer labia,

114
0:05:46.98,000 --> 0:05:5,000
is the fastest-growing cosmetic surgery among teenage girls.

115
0:05:52.98,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It rose 80 percent between 2014 and 2015,

116
0:05:57.7,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and whereas girls under 18 comprise two percent of all cosmetic surgeries,

117
0:06:01.74,000 --> 0:06:04,000
they are five percent of labiaplasty.

118
0:06:05.74,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The most sought-after look, incidentally,

119
0:06:07.74,000 --> 0:06:1,000
in which the outer labia appear fused like a clam shell,

120
0:06:11.5,000 --> 0:06:12,000
is called ...

121
0:06:12.98,000 --> 0:06:13,000
wait for it ...

122
0:06:15.06,000 --> 0:06:16,000
"The Barbie."

123
0:06:16.66,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Groan)

124
0:06:17.98,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I trust I don't have to tell you

125
0:06:20.02,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that Barbie is a) made of plastic

126
0:06:22.94,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and b) has no genitalia.

127
0:06:26.14,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Laughter)

128
0:06:28.06,000 --> 0:06:3,000
The labiaplasty trend has become so worrisome

129
0:06:30.86,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists

130
0:06:34.54,000 --> 0:06:36,000
has issued a statement on the procedure,

131
0:06:36.82,000 --> 0:06:38,000
which is rarely medically indicated,

132
0:06:39.34,000 --> 0:06:41,000
has not been proven safe

133
0:06:41.5,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and whose side effects include scarring, numbness, pain

134
0:06:47.38,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and diminished sexual sensation.

135
0:06:50.38,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Now, admittedly,

136
0:06:51.82,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and blessedly,

137
0:06:53.42,000 --> 0:06:55,000
the number of girls involved is still quite small,

138
0:06:57.02,000 --> 0:07:,000
but you could see them as canaries in a coal mine,

139
0:07:00.1,000 --> 0:07:04,000
telling us something important about the way girls see their bodies.

140
0:07:05.58,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Sara McClelland,

141
0:07:07.3,000 --> 0:07:09,000
a psychologist at the University of Michigan,

142
0:07:09.78,000 --> 0:07:13,000
coined what is my favorite phrase ever in talking about all of this:

143
0:07:15.14,000 --> 0:07:16,000
"Intimate justice."

144
0:07:18.5,000 --> 0:07:22,000
That's the idea that sex has political, as well as personal implications,

145
0:07:22.62,000 --> 0:07:24,000
just like, who does the dishes in your house,

146
0:07:25.3,000 --> 0:07:26,000
or who vacuums the rug.

147
0:07:27.5,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And it raises similar issues about inequality,

148
0:07:31.34,000 --> 0:07:32,000
about economic disparity,

149
0:07:33.34,000 --> 0:07:34,000
violence,

150
0:07:34.58,000 --> 0:07:35,000
physical and mental health.

151
0:07:36.94,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Intimate justice asks us to consider

152
0:07:40.42,000 --> 0:07:43,000
who is entitled to engage in an experience.

153
0:07:43.78,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Who is entitled to enjoy it?

154
0:07:46.3,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Who is the primary beneficiary?

155
0:07:49.06,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And how does each partner define "good enough"?

156
0:07:53.34,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Honestly, I think those questions are tricky and sometimes traumatic

157
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
for adult women to confront,

158
0:08:00.82,000 --> 0:08:02,000
but when we're talking about girls,

159
0:08:03.14,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I just kept coming back to the idea that their early sexual experience

160
0:08:08.46,000 --> 0:08:1,000
shouldn't have to be something that they get over.

161
0:08:13.38,000 --> 0:08:14,000
In her work,

162
0:08:14.62,000 --> 0:08:17,000
McClelland found that young women were more likely than young men

163
0:08:18.46,000 --> 0:08:21,000
to use their partner's pleasure as a measure of their satisfaction.

164
0:08:22.94,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So they'd say things like,

165
0:08:24.3,000 --> 0:08:25,000
"If he's sexually satisfied,

166
0:08:26.14,000 --> 0:08:27,000
then I'm sexually satisfied."

167
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Young men were more likely to measure their satisfaction by their own orgasm.

168
0:08:34.66,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Young women also defined bad sex differently.

169
0:08:39.74,000 --> 0:08:4,000
In the largest ever survey

170
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
ever conducted on American sexual behavior,

171
0:08:44.42,000 --> 0:08:47,000
they reported pain in their sexual encounters

172
0:08:48.22,000 --> 0:08:49,000
30 percent of the time.

173
0:08:51.34,000 --> 0:08:53,000
They also used words like "depressing,"

174
0:08:54.94,000 --> 0:08:55,000
"humiliating,"

175
0:08:56.54,000 --> 0:08:57,000
"degrading."

176
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
The young men never used that language.

177
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So when young women report sexual satisfaction levels

178
0:09:05.66,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that are equal to or greater than young men's --

179
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and they do in research --

180
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that can be deceptive.

181
0:09:13.46,000 --> 0:09:16,000
If a girl goes into an encounter hoping that it won't hurt,

182
0:09:17.1,000 --> 0:09:19,000
wanting to feel close to her partner

183
0:09:19.14,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and expecting him to have an orgasm,

184
0:09:21.98,000 --> 0:09:23,000
she'll be satisfied if those criteria are met.

185
0:09:24.94,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And there's nothing wrong with wanting to feel close to your partner,

186
0:09:28.22,000 --> 0:09:29,000
or wanting him to be happy,

187
0:09:29.58,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and orgasm isn't the only measure of an experience ...

188
0:09:33.38,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but absence of pain --

189
0:09:35.58,000 --> 0:09:38,000
that's a very low bar for your own sexual fulfillment.

190
0:09:40.82,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Listening to all of this and thinking about it,

191
0:09:43.06,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I began to realize that we performed a kind of psychological clitoridectomy

192
0:09:48.38,000 --> 0:09:49,000
on American girls.

193
0:09:50.18,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Starting in infancy,

194
0:09:51.5,000 --> 0:09:54,000
parents of baby boys are more likely to name all their body parts,

195
0:09:55.34,000 --> 0:09:57,000
at least they'll say, "here's your pee-pee."

196
0:09:58.1,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Parents of baby girls go right from navel to knees,

197
0:10:01.3,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and they leave this whole situation in here unnamed.

198
0:10:04.78,000 --> 0:10:05,000
(Laughter)

199
0:10:06.14,000 --> 0:10:09,000
There's no better way to make something unspeakable

200
0:10:09.62,000 --> 0:10:1,000
than not to name it.

201
0:10:12.1,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Then kids go into their puberty education classes

202
0:10:14.54,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and they learn that boys have erections and ejaculations,

203
0:10:18.42,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and girls have ...

204
0:10:20.18,000 --> 0:10:22,000
periods and unwanted pregnancy.

205
0:10:23.86,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And they see that internal diagram of a woman's reproductive system --

206
0:10:27.74,000 --> 0:10:29,000
you know, the one that looks kind of like a steer head --

207
0:10:30.46,000 --> 0:10:31,000
(Laughter)

208
0:10:34.54,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And it always grays out between the legs.

209
0:10:37.58,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So we never say vulva,

210
0:10:39.78,000 --> 0:10:41,000
we certainly never say clitoris.

211
0:10:42.18,000 --> 0:10:43,000
No surprise,

212
0:10:43.42,000 --> 0:10:46,000
fewer than half of teenage girls age 14 to 17

213
0:10:46.58,000 --> 0:10:48,000
have ever masturbated.

214
0:10:49.18,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And then they go into their partnered experience

215
0:10:52.02,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and we expect that somehow they'll think sex is about them,

216
0:10:55.74,000 --> 0:10:59,000
that they'll be able to articulate their needs, their desires, their limits.

217
0:11:01.3,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It's unrealistic.

218
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Here's something, though.

219
0:11:06.14,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Girls' investment in their partner's pleasure remains

220
0:11:09.34,000 --> 0:11:11,000
regardless of the gender of the partner.

221
0:11:12.5,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So in same-sex encounters,

222
0:11:14.78,000 --> 0:11:16,000
the orgasm gap disappears.

223
0:11:17.98,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And young women climax at the same rate as men.

224
0:11:21.94,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Lesbian and bisexual girls would tell me

225
0:11:24.14,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that they felt liberated to get off the script --

226
0:11:27.74,000 --> 0:11:3,000
free to create an encounter that worked for them.

227
0:11:31.18,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Gay girls also challenged the idea of first intercourse

228
0:11:34.86,000 --> 0:11:35,000
as the definition of virginity.

229
0:11:36.82,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Not because intercourse isn't a big deal,

230
0:11:39.42,000 --> 0:11:43,000
but it's worth questioning why we consider this one act,

231
0:11:43.82,000 --> 0:11:45,000
which most girls associate with discomfort or pain,

232
0:11:46.66,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to be the line in the sand of sexual adulthood --

233
0:11:50.18,000 --> 0:11:51,000
so much more meaningful,

234
0:11:51.66,000 --> 0:11:53,000
so much more transformative than anything else.

235
0:11:55.46,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And it's worth considering how this is serving girls;

236
0:11:58.94,000 --> 0:12:01,000
whether it's keeping them safer from disease,

237
0:12:01.98,000 --> 0:12:03,000
coercion, betrayal, assault.

238
0:12:05.42,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Whether it's encouraging mutuality and caring;

239
0:12:09.18,000 --> 0:12:12,000
what it means about the way they see other sex acts;

240
0:12:12.82,000 --> 0:12:14,000
whether it's giving them more control over

241
0:12:15.06,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and joy in their experience,

242
0:12:17.5,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and what it means about gay teens,

243
0:12:20.46,000 --> 0:12:24,000
who can have multiple sex partners without heterosexual intercourse.

244
0:12:25.78,000 --> 0:12:26,000
So I asked a gay girl that I met,

245
0:12:28.34,000 --> 0:12:3,000
"How'd you know you weren't a virgin anymore?"

246
0:12:31.38,000 --> 0:12:32,000
She said she had to Google it.

247
0:12:32.86,000 --> 0:12:34,000
(Laughter)

248
0:12:35.06,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And Google wasn't sure.

249
0:12:37.02,000 --> 0:12:38,000
(Laughter)

250
0:12:38.86,000 --> 0:12:4,000
She finally decided that she wasn't a virgin anymore

251
0:12:41.82,000 --> 0:12:43,000
after she'd had her first orgasm with a partner.

252
0:12:45.78,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And I thought --

253
0:12:47.38,000 --> 0:12:48,000
whoa.

254
0:12:48.94,000 --> 0:12:5,000
What if just for a second

255
0:12:51.62,000 --> 0:12:53,000
we imagined that was the definition?

256
0:12:55.38,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Again, not because intercourse isn't a big deal --

257
0:12:57.74,000 --> 0:12:58,000
of course it is --

258
0:12:59.06,000 --> 0:13:01,000
but it isn't the only big deal,

259
0:13:02.18,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and rather than thinking about sex as a race to a goal,

260
0:13:05.98,000 --> 0:13:1,000
this helps us reconceptualize it as a pool of experiences

261
0:13:11.1,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that include warmth, affection, arousal,

262
0:13:15.74,000 --> 0:13:17,000
desire, touch, intimacy.

263
0:13:19.46,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And it's worth asking young people:

264
0:13:21.7,000 --> 0:13:24,000
who's really the more sexually experienced person?

265
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
The one who makes out with a partner for three hours

266
0:13:28.34,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and experiments with sensual tension and communication,

267
0:13:32.94,000 --> 0:13:35,000
or the one who gets wasted at a party and hooks up with a random

268
0:13:36.78,000 --> 0:13:39,000
in order to dump their "virginity" before they get to college?

269
0:13:41.46,000 --> 0:13:44,000
The only way that shift in thinking can happen though

270
0:13:44.66,000 --> 0:13:48,000
is if we talk to young people more about sex --

271
0:13:48.74,000 --> 0:13:5,000
if we normalize those discussions,

272
0:13:51.1,000 --> 0:13:53,000
integrating them into everyday life,

273
0:13:54.02,000 --> 0:13:57,000
talking about those intimate acts in a different way --

274
0:13:57.58,000 --> 0:13:59,000
the way we mostly have changed

275
0:14:00.38,000 --> 0:14:02,000
in the way that we talk about women in the public realm.

276
0:14:03.54,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Consider a survey of 300 randomly chosen girls

277
0:14:08.14,000 --> 0:14:1,000
from a Dutch and an American university,

278
0:14:10.54,000 --> 0:14:11,000
two similar universities,

279
0:14:12.3,000 --> 0:14:14,000
talking about their early experience of sex.

280
0:14:16.1,000 --> 0:14:2,000
The Dutch girls embodied everything we say we want from our girls.

281
0:14:21.06,000 --> 0:14:22,000
They had fewer negative consequences,

282
0:14:23.02,000 --> 0:14:25,000
like disease, pregnancy, regret --

283
0:14:26.46,000 --> 0:14:27,000
more positive outcomes

284
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
like being able to communicate with their partner,

285
0:14:30.7,000 --> 0:14:31,000
who they said they knew very well;

286
0:14:32.42,000 --> 0:14:34,000
preparing for the experience responsibly;

287
0:14:35.02,000 --> 0:14:36,000
enjoying themselves.

288
0:14:37.5,000 --> 0:14:38,000
What was their secret?

289
0:14:39.54,000 --> 0:14:43,000
The Dutch girls said that their doctors, teachers and parents

290
0:14:43.82,000 --> 0:14:44,000
talked to them candidly,

291
0:14:45.46,000 --> 0:14:46,000
from an early age,

292
0:14:47.22,000 --> 0:14:51,000
about sex, pleasure and the importance of mutual trust.

293
0:14:53.3,000 --> 0:14:54,000
What's more,

294
0:14:54.54,000 --> 0:14:58,000
while American parents weren't necessarily less comfortable talking about sex,

295
0:14:59.34,000 --> 0:15:01,000
we tend to frame those conversations

296
0:15:01.86,000 --> 0:15:04,000
entirely in terms or risk and danger,

297
0:15:06.42,000 --> 0:15:1,000
whereas Dutch parents talk about balancing responsibility and joy.

298
0:15:12.02,000 --> 0:15:13,000
I have to tell you,

299
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
as a parent myself,

300
0:15:15.14,000 --> 0:15:17,000
that hit me hard,

301
0:15:17.22,000 --> 0:15:19,000
because I know,

302
0:15:19.78,000 --> 0:15:21,000
had I not delved into that research,

303
0:15:22.06,000 --> 0:15:25,000
I would have talked to my own child about contraception,

304
0:15:25.86,000 --> 0:15:26,000
about disease protection,

305
0:15:27.74,000 --> 0:15:29,000
about consent because I'm a modern parent,

306
0:15:30.5,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and I would have thought ...

307
0:15:33.82,000 --> 0:15:34,000
job well done.

308
0:15:36.14,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Now I know that's not enough.

309
0:15:39.74,000 --> 0:15:42,000
I also know what I hope for for our girls.

310
0:15:43.78,000 --> 0:15:47,000
I want them to see sexuality as a source of self-knowledge,

311
0:15:48.06,000 --> 0:15:5,000
creativity and communication,

312
0:15:50.3,000 --> 0:15:52,000
despite its potential risks.

313
0:15:52.94,000 --> 0:15:55,000
I want them to be able to revel in their bodies' sensuality

314
0:15:56.42,000 --> 0:15:57,000
without being reduced to it.

315
0:15:58.94,000 --> 0:16:01,000
I want them to be able to ask for what they want in bed,

316
0:16:02.18,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and to get it.

317
0:16:04.38,000 --> 0:16:07,000
I want them to be safe from unwanted pregnancy,

318
0:16:07.86,000 --> 0:16:08,000
disease,

319
0:16:09.1,000 --> 0:16:1,000
cruelty,

320
0:16:10.34,000 --> 0:16:11,000
dehumanization,

321
0:16:11.94,000 --> 0:16:12,000
violence.

322
0:16:13.9,000 --> 0:16:14,000
If they are assaulted,

323
0:16:15.7,000 --> 0:16:18,000
I want them to have recourse from their schools,

324
0:16:19.18,000 --> 0:16:2,000
their employers,

325
0:16:20.62,000 --> 0:16:21,000
the courts.

326
0:16:22.94,000 --> 0:16:23,000
It's a lot to ask,

327
0:16:25.06,000 --> 0:16:26,000
but it's not too much.

328
0:16:27.3,000 --> 0:16:31,000
As parents, teachers, advocates and activists,

329
0:16:31.38,000 --> 0:16:35,000
we have raised a generation of girls to have a voice,

330
0:16:36.18,000 --> 0:16:39,000
to expect egalitarian treatment in the home,

331
0:16:40.06,000 --> 0:16:41,000
in the classroom,

332
0:16:41.34,000 --> 0:16:42,000
in the workplace.

333
0:16:43.54,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Now it's time to demand that intimate justice

334
0:16:48.22,000 --> 0:16:5,000
in their personal lives as well.

335
0:16:51.58,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Thank you.

336
0:16:52.82,000 --> 0:16:54,000
(Applause)

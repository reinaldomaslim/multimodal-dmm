1
0:00:13.48,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I am holding something remarkably old.

2
0:00:16.44,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It is older than any human artifact,

3
0:00:19.44,000 --> 0:00:21,000
older than life on Earth,

4
0:00:21.76,000 --> 0:00:24,000
older than the continents and the oceans between them.

5
0:00:25.52,000 --> 0:00:28,000
This was formed over four billion years ago

6
0:00:28.64,000 --> 0:00:3,000
in the earliest days of the solar system

7
0:00:30.8,000 --> 0:00:31,000
while the planets were still forming.

8
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
This rusty lump of nickel and iron may not appear special,

9
0:00:36.52,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but when it is cut open ...

10
0:00:40.32,000 --> 0:00:42,000
you can see that it is different from earthly metals.

11
0:00:43.44,000 --> 0:00:46,000
This pattern reveals metallic crystals that can only form out in space

12
0:00:47.36,000 --> 0:00:49,000
where molten metal can cool extremely slowly,

13
0:00:49.96,000 --> 0:00:51,000
a few degrees every million years.

14
0:00:52.76,000 --> 0:00:54,000
This was once part of a much larger object,

15
0:00:55.28,000 --> 0:00:57,000
one of millions left over after the planets formed.

16
0:00:57.88,000 --> 0:00:59,000
We call these objects asteroids.

17
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Asteroids are our oldest and most numerous cosmic neighbors.

18
0:01:04.96,000 --> 0:01:07,000
This graphic shows near-Earth asteroids orbiting around the Sun,

19
0:01:08.04,000 --> 0:01:09,000
shown in yellow,

20
0:01:09.32,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and swinging close to the Earth's orbit,

21
0:01:11.28,000 --> 0:01:12,000
shown in blue.

22
0:01:12.52,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The sizes of the Earth, Sun and asteroids have been greatly exaggerated

23
0:01:15.88,000 --> 0:01:16,000
so you can see them clearly.

24
0:01:17.28,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Teams of scientists across the globe are searching for these objects,

25
0:01:20.68,000 --> 0:01:21,000
discovering new ones every day,

26
0:01:22.64,000 --> 0:01:24,000
steadily mapping near-Earth space.

27
0:01:25.44,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Much of this work is funded by NASA.

28
0:01:27.76,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I think of the search for these asteroids as a giant public works project,

29
0:01:31.56,000 --> 0:01:34,000
but instead of building a highway, we're charting outer space,

30
0:01:34.84,000 --> 0:01:36,000
building an archive that will last for generations.

31
0:01:37.84,000 --> 0:01:42,000
These are the 1,556 near-Earth asteroids discovered just last year.

32
0:01:45.8,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And these are all of the known near-Earth asteroids,

33
0:01:49.36,000 --> 0:01:53,000
which at last count was 13,733.

34
0:01:53.4,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Each one has been imaged, cataloged

35
0:01:55.56,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and had its path around the Sun determined.

36
0:01:57.96,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Although it varies from asteroid to asteroid,

37
0:02:00.08,000 --> 0:02:03,000
the paths of most asteroids can be predicted for dozens of years.

38
0:02:03.36,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And the paths of some asteroids can be predicted with incredible precision.

39
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
For example, scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

40
0:02:09.84,000 --> 0:02:13,000
predicted where the asteroid Toutatis was going to be four years in advance

41
0:02:13.88,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to within 30 kilometers.

42
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
In those four years,

43
0:02:17.32,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Toutatis traveled 8.5 billion kilometers.

44
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
That's a fractional precision

45
0:02:22.759,000 --> 0:02:3,000
of 0.000000004.

46
0:02:31.96,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:34.48,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Now, the reason I have this beautiful asteroid fragment

48
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
is because, like all neighbors,

49
0:02:38.72,000 --> 0:02:4,000
asteroids sometimes drop by unexpectedly.

50
0:02:41.4,000 --> 0:02:42,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:44.52,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Three years ago today,

52
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
a small asteroid exploded over the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia.

53
0:02:49.84,000 --> 0:02:51,000
That object was about 19 meters across,

54
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
or about as big as a convenience store.

55
0:02:54.84,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Objects of this size hit the Earth every 50 years or so.

56
0:02:59.72,000 --> 0:03:,000
66 million years ago,

57
0:03:01.6,000 --> 0:03:02,000
a much larger object hit the Earth,

58
0:03:03.56,000 --> 0:03:04,000
causing a massive extinction.

59
0:03:05.36,000 --> 0:03:08,000
75 percent of plant and animal species were lost,

60
0:03:08.6,000 --> 0:03:1,000
including, sadly, the dinosaurs.

61
0:03:11.32,000 --> 0:03:13,000
That object was about 10 kilometers across,

62
0:03:14.04,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and 10 kilometers is roughly the cruising altitude of a 747 jet.

63
0:03:18.24,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So the next time you're in an airplane,

64
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
snag a window seat, look out and imagine a rock so enormous

65
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that resting on the ground,

66
0:03:26.12,000 --> 0:03:27,000
it just grazes your wingtip.

67
0:03:28.88,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It's so wide that it takes your plane one full minute to fly past it.

68
0:03:33.278,000 --> 0:03:35,000
That's the size of the asteroid that hit the Earth.

69
0:03:36.518,000 --> 0:03:37,000
It has only been within my lifetime

70
0:03:38.318,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that asteroids have been considered a credible threat to our planet.

71
0:03:41.558,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And since then, there's been a focused effort underway

72
0:03:44.158,000 --> 0:03:45,000
to discover and catalog these objects.

73
0:03:47.238,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I am lucky enough to be part of this effort.

74
0:03:49.358,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I'm part of a team of scientists that use NASA's NEOWISE telescope.

75
0:03:53.038,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Now, NEOWISE was not designed to find asteroids.

76
0:03:55.758,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It was designed to orbit the earth and look far beyond our solar system

77
0:03:59.998,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to seek out the coldest stars and the most luminous galaxies.

78
0:04:03.438,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And it did that very well for its designed lifetime of seven months.

79
0:04:07.518,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But today, six years later, it's still going.

80
0:04:10.798,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We've repurposed it to discover and study asteroids.

81
0:04:13.558,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And although it's a wonderful little space robot,

82
0:04:15.918,000 --> 0:04:17,000
these days it's kind of like a used car.

83
0:04:18.518,000 --> 0:04:21,000
The cryogen that used to refrigerate its sensors is long gone,

84
0:04:21.798,000 --> 0:04:23,000
so we joke that its air-conditioning is broken.

85
0:04:24.478,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It's got 920 million miles on the odometer,

86
0:04:28.918,000 --> 0:04:29,000
but it still runs great

87
0:04:30.198,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and reliably takes a photograph of the sky every 11 seconds.

88
0:04:33.798,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It's taken 23 photos since I began speaking to you.

89
0:04:38.118,000 --> 0:04:4,000
One of the reasons NEOWISE is so valuable

90
0:04:40.318,000 --> 0:04:42,000
is that it sees the sky in the thermal infrared.

91
0:04:42.958,000 --> 0:04:45,000
That means that instead of seeing the sunlight that asteroids reflect,

92
0:04:46.318,000 --> 0:04:47,000
NEOWISE sees the heat that they emit.

93
0:04:48.158,000 --> 0:04:51,000
This is a vital capability since some asteroids are as dark as coal

94
0:04:51.918,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and can be difficult or impossible to spot with other telescopes.

95
0:04:55.398,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But all asteroids, light or dark, shine brightly for NEOWISE.

96
0:05:00.958,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Astronomers are using every technique at their disposal

97
0:05:03.758,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to discover and study asteroids.

98
0:05:06.078,000 --> 0:05:08,000
In 2010, a historic milestone was reached.

99
0:05:08.958,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The community, together, discovered over 90 percent of asteroids

100
0:05:13.038,000 --> 0:05:14,000
bigger than one kilometer across --

101
0:05:14.918,000 --> 0:05:16,000
objects capable of massive destruction to Earth.

102
0:05:17.918,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But the job's not done yet.

103
0:05:19.518,000 --> 0:05:23,000
An object 140 meters or bigger could decimate a medium-sized country.

104
0:05:24.478,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So far, we've only found 25 percent of those.

105
0:05:28.238,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We must keep searching the sky for near-Earth asteroids.

106
0:05:31.678,000 --> 0:05:33,000
We are the only species able to understand calculus

107
0:05:34.438,000 --> 0:05:35,000
or build telescopes.

108
0:05:36.118,000 --> 0:05:37,000
We know how to find these objects.

109
0:05:38.118,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This is our responsibility.

110
0:05:40.278,000 --> 0:05:43,000
If we found a hazardous asteroid with significant early warning,

111
0:05:44.078,000 --> 0:05:45,000
we could nudge it out of the way.

112
0:05:45.798,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Unlike earthquakes, hurricanes or volcanic eruptions,

113
0:05:48.878,000 --> 0:05:5,000
an asteroid impact can be precisely predicted

114
0:05:51.798,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and prevented.

115
0:05:53.278,000 --> 0:05:56,000
What we need to do now is map near-Earth space.

116
0:05:56.438,000 --> 0:05:57,000
We must keep searching the sky.

117
0:05:58.318,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Thank you.

118
0:05:59.558,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.653,000 --> 0:00:13,000
In the mid-'90s,

2
0:00:14.265,000 --> 0:00:16,000
the CDC and Kaiser Permanente

3
0:00:16.872,000 --> 0:00:2,000
discovered an exposure that dramatically increased the risk

4
0:00:20.992,000 --> 0:00:25,000
for seven out of 10 of the leading causes of death in the United States.

5
0:00:26.953,000 --> 0:00:29,000
In high doses, it affects brain development,

6
0:00:30.344,000 --> 0:00:33,000
the immune system, hormonal systems,

7
0:00:34.011,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed.

8
0:00:38.684,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Folks who are exposed in very high doses

9
0:00:42.205,000 --> 0:00:46,000
have triple the lifetime risk of heart disease and lung cancer

10
0:00:46.292,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and a 20-year difference in life expectancy.

11
0:00:51.911,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And yet, doctors today are not trained in routine screening or treatment.

12
0:00:58.203,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Now, the exposure I'm talking about is not a pesticide or a packaging chemical.

13
0:01:03.558,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It's childhood trauma.

14
0:01:06.968,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Okay. What kind of trauma am I talking about here?

15
0:01:09.686,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I'm not talking about failing a test or losing a basketball game.

16
0:01:13.995,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I am talking about threats that are so severe or pervasive

17
0:01:18.736,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that they literally get under our skin and change our physiology:

18
0:01:23.333,000 --> 0:01:25,000
things like abuse or neglect,

19
0:01:25.725,000 --> 0:01:28,000
or growing up with a parent who struggles with mental illness

20
0:01:29.495,000 --> 0:01:3,000
or substance dependence.

21
0:01:31.887,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now, for a long time,

22
0:01:33.444,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I viewed these things in the way I was trained to view them,

23
0:01:36.441,000 --> 0:01:4,000
either as a social problem -- refer to social services --

24
0:01:40.533,000 --> 0:01:44,000
or as a mental health problem -- refer to mental health services.

25
0:01:46.088,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And then something happened to make me rethink my entire approach.

26
0:01:51.776,000 --> 0:01:52,000
When I finished my residency,

27
0:01:53.648,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I wanted to go someplace where I felt really needed,

28
0:01:57.372,000 --> 0:02:,000
someplace where I could make a difference.

29
0:02:00.53,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So I came to work for California Pacific Medical Center,

30
0:02:03.646,000 --> 0:02:06,000
one of the best private hospitals in Northern California,

31
0:02:07.472,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and together, we opened a clinic in Bayview-Hunters Point,

32
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
one of the poorest, most underserved neighborhoods in San Francisco.

33
0:02:16.263,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Now, prior to that point,

34
0:02:18.118,000 --> 0:02:2,000
there had been only one pediatrician in all of Bayview

35
0:02:20.98,000 --> 0:02:23,000
to serve more than 10,000 children,

36
0:02:24.423,000 --> 0:02:28,000
so we hung a shingle, and we were able to provide top-quality care

37
0:02:29.072,000 --> 0:02:3,000
regardless of ability to pay.

38
0:02:31.057,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It was so cool. We targeted the typical health disparities:

39
0:02:35.219,000 --> 0:02:39,000
access to care, immunization rates, asthma hospitalization rates,

40
0:02:40.026,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and we hit all of our numbers.

41
0:02:42.183,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We felt very proud of ourselves.

42
0:02:45.446,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But then I started noticing a disturbing trend.

43
0:02:48.627,000 --> 0:02:51,000
A lot of kids were being referred to me for ADHD,

44
0:02:52.517,000 --> 0:02:54,000
or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,

45
0:02:55.514,000 --> 0:02:59,000
but when I actually did a thorough history and physical,

46
0:03:00.396,000 --> 0:03:03,000
what I found was that for most of my patients,

47
0:03:03.595,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I couldn't make a diagnosis of ADHD.

48
0:03:07.264,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Most of the kids I was seeing had experienced such severe trauma

49
0:03:12.834,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that it felt like something else was going on.

50
0:03:16.224,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Somehow I was missing something important.

51
0:03:21.516,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Now, before I did my residency, I did a master's degree in public health,

52
0:03:25.317,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and one of the things that they teach you in public health school

53
0:03:28.41,000 --> 0:03:29,000
is that if you're a doctor

54
0:03:30.295,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and you see 100 kids that all drink from the same well,

55
0:03:34.079,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and 98 of them develop diarrhea,

56
0:03:37.477,000 --> 0:03:39,000
you can go ahead and write that prescription

57
0:03:39.763,000 --> 0:03:43,000
for dose after dose after dose of antibiotics,

58
0:03:44.092,000 --> 0:03:49,000
or you can walk over and say, "What the hell is in this well?"

59
0:03:49.915,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So I began reading everything that I could get my hands on

60
0:03:53.708,000 --> 0:03:55,000
about how exposure to adversity

61
0:03:56.262,000 --> 0:03:59,000
affects the developing brains and bodies of children.

62
0:03:59.741,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And then one day, my colleague walked into my office,

63
0:04:03.646,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and he said, "Dr. Burke, have you seen this?"

64
0:04:08.9,000 --> 0:04:12,000
In his hand was a copy of a research study

65
0:04:12.902,000 --> 0:04:15,000
called the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study.

66
0:04:16.569,000 --> 0:04:23,000
That day changed my clinical practice and ultimately my career.

67
0:04:24.465,000 --> 0:04:26,000
The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study

68
0:04:26.573,000 --> 0:04:29,000
is something that everybody needs to know about.

69
0:04:29.805,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It was done by Dr. Vince Felitti at Kaiser and Dr. Bob Anda at the CDC,

70
0:04:35.136,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and together, they asked 17,500 adults about their history of exposure

71
0:04:43.334,000 --> 0:04:47,000
to what they called "adverse childhood experiences," or ACEs.

72
0:04:48.911,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Those include physical, emotional, or sexual abuse;

73
0:04:52.838,000 --> 0:04:55,000
physical or emotional neglect;

74
0:04:56.764,000 --> 0:04:59,000
parental mental illness, substance dependence, incarceration;

75
0:04:59.858,000 --> 0:05:01,000
parental separation or divorce;

76
0:05:02.637,000 --> 0:05:04,000
or domestic violence.

77
0:05:05.172,000 --> 0:05:09,000
For every yes, you would get a point on your ACE score.

78
0:05:09.608,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And then what they did

79
0:05:11.116,000 --> 0:05:16,000
was they correlated these ACE scores against health outcomes.

80
0:05:16.836,000 --> 0:05:18,000
What they found was striking.

81
0:05:19.673,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Two things:

82
0:05:20.968,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Number one, ACEs are incredibly common.

83
0:05:25.23,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Sixty-seven percent of the population had at least one ACE,

84
0:05:32.034,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and 12.6 percent, one in eight, had four or more ACEs.

85
0:05:38.692,000 --> 0:05:4,000
The second thing that they found

86
0:05:40.971,000 --> 0:05:43,000
was that there was a dose-response relationship

87
0:05:44.433,000 --> 0:05:48,000
between ACEs and health outcomes:

88
0:05:49.033,000 --> 0:05:52,000
the higher your ACE score, the worse your health outcomes.

89
0:05:52.952,000 --> 0:05:55,000
For a person with an ACE score of four or more,

90
0:05:56.203,000 --> 0:05:59,000
their relative risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

91
0:05:59.895,000 --> 0:06:03,000
was two and a half times that of someone with an ACE score of zero.

92
0:06:05.096,000 --> 0:06:08,000
For hepatitis, it was also two and a half times.

93
0:06:08.37,000 --> 0:06:11,000
For depression, it was four and a half times.

94
0:06:11.69,000 --> 0:06:14,000
For suicidality, it was 12 times.

95
0:06:15.123,000 --> 0:06:18,000
A person with an ACE score of seven or more

96
0:06:18.288,000 --> 0:06:22,000
had triple the lifetime risk of lung cancer

97
0:06:22.858,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and three and a half times the risk of ischemic heart disease,

98
0:06:26.829,000 --> 0:06:29,000
the number one killer in the United States of America.

99
0:06:31.124,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Well, of course this makes sense.

100
0:06:33.887,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Some people looked at this data and they said, "Come on.

101
0:06:38.554,000 --> 0:06:42,000
You have a rough childhood, you're more likely to drink and smoke

102
0:06:43.376,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and do all these things that are going to ruin your health.

103
0:06:46.191,000 --> 0:06:49,000
This isn't science. This is just bad behavior."

104
0:06:50.486,000 --> 0:06:55,000
It turns out this is exactly where the science comes in.

105
0:06:55.725,000 --> 0:06:59,000
We now understand better than we ever have before

106
0:07:00.379,000 --> 0:07:03,000
how exposure to early adversity

107
0:07:03.631,000 --> 0:07:06,000
affects the developing brains and bodies of children.

108
0:07:06.719,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It affects areas like the nucleus accumbens,

109
0:07:09.505,000 --> 0:07:11,000
the pleasure and reward center of the brain

110
0:07:12.036,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that is implicated in substance dependence.

111
0:07:14.682,000 --> 0:07:16,000
It inhibits the prefrontal cortex,

112
0:07:17.404,000 --> 0:07:21,000
which is necessary for impulse control and executive function,

113
0:07:21.461,000 --> 0:07:23,000
a critical area for learning.

114
0:07:23.528,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And on MRI scans,

115
0:07:25.216,000 --> 0:07:28,000
we see measurable differences in the amygdala,

116
0:07:29.204,000 --> 0:07:31,000
the brain's fear response center.

117
0:07:32.246,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So there are real neurologic reasons

118
0:07:35.766,000 --> 0:07:38,000
why folks exposed to high doses of adversity

119
0:07:39.296,000 --> 0:07:42,000
are more likely to engage in high-risk behavior,

120
0:07:42.593,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and that's important to know.

121
0:07:44.497,000 --> 0:07:49,000
But it turns out that even if you don't engage in any high-risk behavior,

122
0:07:50.116,000 --> 0:07:55,000
you're still more likely to develop heart disease or cancer.

123
0:07:56.101,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The reason for this has to do with the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis,

124
0:08:02.027,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the brain's and body's stress response system

125
0:08:05.696,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that governs our fight-or-flight response.

126
0:08:09.476,000 --> 0:08:1,000
How does it work?

127
0:08:11.431,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Well, imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bear.

128
0:08:15.169,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Immediately, your hypothalamus sends a signal to your pituitary,

129
0:08:19.326,000 --> 0:08:21,000
which sends a signal to your adrenal gland that says,

130
0:08:21.927,000 --> 0:08:24,000
"Release stress hormones! Adrenaline! Cortisol!"

131
0:08:25.478,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And so your heart starts to pound,

132
0:08:28.099,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Your pupils dilate, your airways open up,

133
0:08:30.234,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and you are ready to either fight that bear or run from the bear.

134
0:08:36.482,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And that is wonderful

135
0:08:38.798,000 --> 0:08:41,000
if you're in a forest and there's a bear.

136
0:08:42.289,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Laughter)

137
0:08:44.843,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But the problem is what happens when the bear comes home every night,

138
0:08:50.256,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and this system is activated over and over and over again,

139
0:08:55.904,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and it goes from being adaptive, or life-saving,

140
0:09:00.408,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to maladaptive, or health-damaging.

141
0:09:04.533,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation,

142
0:09:10.036,000 --> 0:09:13,000
because their brains and bodies are just developing.

143
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:2,000
High doses of adversity not only affect brain structure and function,

144
0:09:20.075,000 --> 0:09:23,000
they affect the developing immune system,

145
0:09:23.301,000 --> 0:09:25,000
developing hormonal systems,

146
0:09:26.144,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed.

147
0:09:32.413,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So for me, this information threw my old training out the window,

148
0:09:36.871,000 --> 0:09:39,000
because when we understand the mechanism of a disease,

149
0:09:40.818,000 --> 0:09:44,000
when we know not only which pathways are disrupted, but how,

150
0:09:45.555,000 --> 0:09:49,000
then as doctors, it is our job to use this science

151
0:09:50.216,000 --> 0:09:52,000
for prevention and treatment.

152
0:09:52.845,000 --> 0:09:53,000
That's what we do.

153
0:09:54.728,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So in San Francisco, we created the Center for Youth Wellness

154
0:09:58.791,000 --> 0:10:03,000
to prevent, screen and heal the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress.

155
0:10:04.224,000 --> 0:10:08,000
We started simply with routine screening of every one of our kids

156
0:10:08.807,000 --> 0:10:09,000
at their regular physical,

157
0:10:10.334,000 --> 0:10:14,000
because I know that if my patient has an ACE score of 4,

158
0:10:15.038,000 --> 0:10:19,000
she's two and a half times as likely to develop hepatitis or COPD,

159
0:10:19.595,000 --> 0:10:21,000
she's four and half times as likely to become depressed,

160
0:10:22.497,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and she's 12 times as likely to attempt to take her own life

161
0:10:26.56,000 --> 0:10:28,000
as my patient with zero ACEs.

162
0:10:28.86,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I know that when she's in my exam room.

163
0:10:32.249,000 --> 0:10:34,000
For our patients who do screen positive,

164
0:10:35.013,000 --> 0:10:4,000
we have a multidisciplinary treatment team that works to reduce the dose of adversity

165
0:10:40.235,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and treat symptoms using best practices, including home visits, care coordination,

166
0:10:46.118,000 --> 0:10:49,000
mental health care, nutrition,

167
0:10:50.032,000 --> 0:10:54,000
holistic interventions, and yes, medication when necessary.

168
0:10:54.747,000 --> 0:10:58,000
But we also educate parents about the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress

169
0:10:59.436,000 --> 0:11:04,000
the same way you would for covering electrical outlets, or lead poisoning,

170
0:11:04.946,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and we tailor the care of our asthmatics and our diabetics

171
0:11:08.886,000 --> 0:11:12,000
in a way that recognizes that they may need more aggressive treatment,

172
0:11:13.344,000 --> 0:11:17,000
given the changes to their hormonal and immune systems.

173
0:11:17.771,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So the other thing that happens when you understand this science

174
0:11:21.863,000 --> 0:11:23,000
is that you want to shout it from the rooftops,

175
0:11:24.861,000 --> 0:11:28,000
because this isn't just an issue for kids in Bayview.

176
0:11:29.191,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I figured the minute that everybody else heard about this,

177
0:11:32.825,000 --> 0:11:35,000
it would be routine screening, multi-disciplinary treatment teams,

178
0:11:36.308,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and it would be a race to the most effective clinical treatment protocols.

179
0:11:41.105,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Yeah. That did not happen.

180
0:11:45.225,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And that was a huge learning for me.

181
0:11:48.08,000 --> 0:11:52,000
What I had thought of as simply best clinical practice

182
0:11:52.887,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I now understand to be a movement.

183
0:11:57.125,000 --> 0:11:59,000
In the words of Dr. Robert Block,

184
0:11:59.475,000 --> 0:12:02,000
the former President of the American Academy of Pediatrics,

185
0:12:03.176,000 --> 0:12:05,000
"Adverse childhood experiences

186
0:12:06.128,000 --> 0:12:11,000
are the single greatest unaddressed public health threat

187
0:12:11.138,000 --> 0:12:13,000
facing our nation today."

188
0:12:13.387,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And for a lot of people, that's a terrifying prospect.

189
0:12:18.033,000 --> 0:12:23,000
The scope and scale of the problem seems so large that it feels overwhelming

190
0:12:23.838,000 --> 0:12:25,000
to think about how we might approach it.

191
0:12:26.462,000 --> 0:12:3,000
But for me, that's actually where the hopes lies,

192
0:12:30.869,000 --> 0:12:32,000
because when we have the right framework,

193
0:12:33.533,000 --> 0:12:38,000
when we recognize this to be a public health crisis,

194
0:12:38.79,000 --> 0:12:43,000
then we can begin to use the right tool kit to come up with solutions.

195
0:12:43.794,000 --> 0:12:46,000
From tobacco to lead poisoning to HIV/AIDS,

196
0:12:47.522,000 --> 0:12:52,000
the United States actually has quite a strong track record

197
0:12:52.535,000 --> 0:12:54,000
with addressing public health problems,

198
0:12:55.439,000 --> 0:13:,000
but replicating those successes with ACEs and toxic stress

199
0:13:00.942,000 --> 0:13:04,000
is going to take determination and commitment,

200
0:13:05.539,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and when I look at what our nation's response has been so far,

201
0:13:09.511,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I wonder,

202
0:13:11.355,000 --> 0:13:14,000
why haven't we taken this more seriously?

203
0:13:15.154,000 --> 0:13:18,000
You know, at first I thought that we marginalized the issue

204
0:13:18.976,000 --> 0:13:19,000
because it doesn't apply to us.

205
0:13:20.9,000 --> 0:13:23,000
That's an issue for those kids in those neighborhoods.

206
0:13:24.198,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Which is weird, because the data doesn't bear that out.

207
0:13:28.387,000 --> 0:13:32,000
The original ACEs study was done in a population

208
0:13:32.52,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that was 70 percent Caucasian,

209
0:13:35.307,000 --> 0:13:38,000
70 percent college-educated.

210
0:13:38.465,000 --> 0:13:41,000
But then, the more I talked to folks,

211
0:13:41.947,000 --> 0:13:45,000
I'm beginning to think that maybe I had it completely backwards.

212
0:13:47.334,000 --> 0:13:52,000
If I were to ask how many people in this room

213
0:13:53.278,000 --> 0:13:56,000
grew up with a family member who suffered from mental illness,

214
0:13:57.587,000 --> 0:13:59,000
I bet a few hands would go up.

215
0:14:00.053,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And then if I were to ask how many folks had a parent who maybe drank too much,

216
0:14:05.754,000 --> 0:14:09,000
or who really believed that if you spare the rod, you spoil the child,

217
0:14:11.077,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I bet a few more hands would go up.

218
0:14:14.195,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Even in this room, this is an issue that touches many of us,

219
0:14:19.276,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and I am beginning to believe that we marginalize the issue

220
0:14:22.665,000 --> 0:14:24,000
because it does apply to us.

221
0:14:25.261,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Maybe it's easier to see in other zip codes

222
0:14:28.121,000 --> 0:14:3,000
because we don't want to look at it.

223
0:14:31.024,000 --> 0:14:33,000
We'd rather be sick.

224
0:14:34.112,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Fortunately, scientific advances and, frankly, economic realities

225
0:14:40.44,000 --> 0:14:44,000
make that option less viable every day.

226
0:14:45.524,000 --> 0:14:46,000
The science is clear:

227
0:14:47.991,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Early adversity dramatically affects health across a lifetime.

228
0:14:53.87,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Today, we are beginning to understand how to interrupt the progression

229
0:14:58.632,000 --> 0:15:02,000
from early adversity to disease and early death,

230
0:15:02.933,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and 30 years from now,

231
0:15:05.458,000 --> 0:15:07,000
the child who has a high ACE score

232
0:15:07.966,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and whose behavioral symptoms go unrecognized,

233
0:15:11.071,000 --> 0:15:13,000
whose asthma management is not connected,

234
0:15:13.771,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and who goes on to develop high blood pressure

235
0:15:16.975,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and early heart disease or cancer

236
0:15:19.819,000 --> 0:15:24,000
will be just as anomalous as a six-month mortality from HIV/AIDS.

237
0:15:24.963,000 --> 0:15:28,000
People will look at that situation and say, "What the heck happened there?"

238
0:15:30.468,000 --> 0:15:32,000
This is treatable.

239
0:15:32.755,000 --> 0:15:34,000
This is beatable.

240
0:15:35.527,000 --> 0:15:39,000
The single most important thing that we need today

241
0:15:39.69,000 --> 0:15:42,000
is the courage to look this problem in the face

242
0:15:43.017,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and say, this is real and this is all of us.

243
0:15:48.089,000 --> 0:15:52,000
I believe that we are the movement.

244
0:15:52.826,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Thank you.

245
0:15:54.204,000 --> 0:15:57,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.792,000 --> 0:00:15,000
We're seen as the organization that is the bucket for failed social policy.

2
0:00:16.485,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I can't define who comes to us or how long they stay.

3
0:00:19.767,000 --> 0:00:21,000
We get the people for whom nothing else has worked,

4
0:00:21.903,000 --> 0:00:22,000
people who have fallen through all

5
0:00:23.341,000 --> 0:00:24,000
of the other social safety nets.

6
0:00:25.254,000 --> 0:00:27,000
They can't contain them, so we must.

7
0:00:27.587,000 --> 0:00:28,000
That's our job:

8
0:00:29.03,000 --> 0:00:32,000
contain them, control them.

9
0:00:32.137,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Over the years, as a prison system,

10
0:00:34.594,000 --> 0:00:35,000
as a nation, and as a society,

11
0:00:36.415,000 --> 0:00:37,000
we've become very good at that,

12
0:00:37.89,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but that shouldn't make you happy.

13
0:00:40.01,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Today we incarcerate more people per capita

14
0:00:41.71,000 --> 0:00:43,000
than any other country in the world.

15
0:00:43.847,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We have more black men in prison today

16
0:00:45.76,000 --> 0:00:47,000
than were under slavery in 1850.

17
0:00:48.321,000 --> 0:00:49,000
We house the parents of almost three million

18
0:00:50.081,000 --> 0:00:51,000
of our community's children,

19
0:00:51.805,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and we've become the new asylum,

20
0:00:53.825,000 --> 0:00:56,000
the largest mental health provider in this nation.

21
0:00:56.862,000 --> 0:00:57,000
When we lock someone up,

22
0:00:58.333,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that is no small thing.

23
0:00:59.964,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And yet, we are called the Department of Corrections.

24
0:01:03.122,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Today I want to talk about

25
0:01:04.51,000 --> 0:01:06,000
changing the way we think about corrections.

26
0:01:06.605,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I believe, and my experience tells me,

27
0:01:08.664,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that when we change the way we think,

28
0:01:10.373,000 --> 0:01:12,000
we create new possibilities, or futures,

29
0:01:13.207,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and prisons need a different future.

30
0:01:15.833,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I've spent my entire career in corrections, over 30 years.

31
0:01:19.305,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I followed my dad into this field.

32
0:01:20.785,000 --> 0:01:23,000
He was a Vietnam veteran. Corrections suited him.

33
0:01:23.93,000 --> 0:01:26,000
He was strong, steady, disciplined.

34
0:01:26.94,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I was not so much any of those things,

35
0:01:28.38,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and I'm sure that worried him about me.

36
0:01:30.779,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Eventually I decided, if I was going to end up in prison,

37
0:01:33.622,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I'd better end up on the right side of the bars,

38
0:01:34.943,000 --> 0:01:35,000
so I thought I'd check it out,

39
0:01:36.65,000 --> 0:01:38,000
take a tour of the place my dad worked,

40
0:01:38.92,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the McNeil Island Penitentiary.

41
0:01:41.101,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Now this was the early '80s,

42
0:01:42.811,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and prisons weren't quite what you see

43
0:01:44.338,000 --> 0:01:45,000
on TV or in the movies.

44
0:01:46.32,000 --> 0:01:48,000
In many ways, it was worse.

45
0:01:48.84,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I walked into a cell house that was five tiers high.

46
0:01:51.454,000 --> 0:01:52,000
There were eight men to a cell.

47
0:01:53.079,000 --> 0:01:55,000
there were 550 men in that living unit.

48
0:01:55.427,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And just in case you wondered,

49
0:01:57.31,000 --> 0:02:,000
they shared one toilet in those small confines.

50
0:02:00.376,000 --> 0:02:01,000
An officer put a key in a lockbox,

51
0:02:01.879,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and hundreds of men streamed out of their cells.

52
0:02:04.421,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Hundreds of men streamed out of their cells.

53
0:02:06.4,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I walked away as fast as I could.

54
0:02:08.763,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Eventually I went back and I started as an officer there.

55
0:02:11.361,000 --> 0:02:12,000
My job was to run one of those cell blocks

56
0:02:13.158,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and to control those hundreds of men.

57
0:02:16.319,000 --> 0:02:17,000
When I went to work at our receptions center,

58
0:02:18.164,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I could actually hear the inmates roiling from the parking lot,

59
0:02:20.89,000 --> 0:02:22,000
shaking cell doors, yelling,

60
0:02:23.384,000 --> 0:02:24,000
tearing up their cells.

61
0:02:25.058,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Take hundreds of volatile people and lock them up,

62
0:02:27.422,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and what you get is chaos.

63
0:02:29.186,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Contain and control — that was our job.

64
0:02:31.959,000 --> 0:02:33,000
One way we learned to do this more effectively

65
0:02:34.28,000 --> 0:02:35,000
was a new type of housing unit

66
0:02:35.49,000 --> 0:02:37,000
called the Intensive Management Unit, IMU,

67
0:02:38.193,000 --> 0:02:39,000
a modern version of a "hole."

68
0:02:40.016,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We put inmates in cells behind solid steel doors

69
0:02:42.538,000 --> 0:02:44,000
with cuff ports so we could restrain them

70
0:02:44.819,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and feed them.

71
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Guess what?

72
0:02:48.497,000 --> 0:02:49,000
It got quieter.

73
0:02:49.991,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Disturbances died down in the general population.

74
0:02:52.488,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Places became safer

75
0:02:53.839,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because those inmates who were most violent or disruptive

76
0:02:56.439,000 --> 0:02:57,000
could now be isolated.

77
0:02:57.864,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But isolation isn't good.

78
0:02:59.595,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Deprive people of social contact and they deteriorate.

79
0:03:02.424,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It was hard getting them out of IMU,

80
0:03:04.359,000 --> 0:03:06,000
for them and for us.

81
0:03:06.912,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Even in prison, it's no small thing

82
0:03:09.381,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to lock someone up.

83
0:03:11.367,000 --> 0:03:13,000
My next assignment was to one of the state's deep-end prisons

84
0:03:13.921,000 --> 0:03:15,000
where some of our more violent or disruptive inmates are housed.

85
0:03:16.856,000 --> 0:03:17,000
By then, the industry had advanced a lot,

86
0:03:18.7,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and we had different tools and techniques

87
0:03:20.758,000 --> 0:03:22,000
to manage disruptive behavior.

88
0:03:22.795,000 --> 0:03:24,000
We had beanbag guns and pepper spray

89
0:03:25.02,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and plexiglass shields,

90
0:03:26.91,000 --> 0:03:28,000
flash bangs, emergency response teams.

91
0:03:29.345,000 --> 0:03:3,000
We met violence with force

92
0:03:31.209,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and chaos with chaos.

93
0:03:32.67,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We were pretty good at putting out fires.

94
0:03:35.197,000 --> 0:03:38,000
While I was there, I met two experienced correctional workers

95
0:03:38.498,000 --> 0:03:39,000
who were also researchers,

96
0:03:40.034,000 --> 0:03:43,000
an anthropologist and a sociologist.

97
0:03:43.225,000 --> 0:03:44,000
One day, one of them commented to me and said,

98
0:03:44.775,000 --> 0:03:46,000
"You know, you're pretty good at putting out fires.

99
0:03:46.813,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Have you ever thought about how to prevent them?"

100
0:03:50.647,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I was patient with them,

101
0:03:52.624,000 --> 0:03:53,000
explaining our brute force approach

102
0:03:53.933,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to making prisons safer.

103
0:03:55.79,000 --> 0:03:56,000
They were patient with me.

104
0:03:57.324,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Out of those conversations grew some new ideas

105
0:03:59.501,000 --> 0:04:,000
and we started some small experiments.

106
0:04:01.397,000 --> 0:04:03,000
First, we started training our officers in teams

107
0:04:03.798,000 --> 0:04:06,000
rather than sending them one or two at a time to the state training academy.

108
0:04:07.04,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Instead of four weeks of training, we gave them 10.

109
0:04:09.35,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Then we experimented with an apprenticeship model

110
0:04:11.627,000 --> 0:04:14,000
where we paired new staff with veteran staff.

111
0:04:15.2,000 --> 0:04:17,000
They both got better at the work.

112
0:04:17.713,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Second, we added verbal de-escalation skills

113
0:04:20.323,000 --> 0:04:21,000
into the training continuum

114
0:04:22.213,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and made it part of the use of force continuum.

115
0:04:24.95,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It was the non-force use of force.

116
0:04:27.434,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And then we did something even more radical.

117
0:04:29.036,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We trained the inmates on those same skills.

118
0:04:31.346,000 --> 0:04:33,000
We changed the skill set,

119
0:04:33.642,000 --> 0:04:36,000
reducing violence, not just responding to it.

120
0:04:36.813,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Third, when we expanded our facility, we tried a new type of design.

121
0:04:40.047,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Now the biggest and most controversial component

122
0:04:42.752,000 --> 0:04:45,000
of this design, of course, was the toilet.

123
0:04:46.429,000 --> 0:04:47,000
There were no toilets.

124
0:04:48.118,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Now that might not sound significant to you here today,

125
0:04:50.749,000 --> 0:04:51,000
but at the time, it was huge.

126
0:04:52.134,000 --> 0:04:54,000
No one had ever heard of a cell without a toilet.

127
0:04:54.247,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We all thought it was dangerous and crazy.

128
0:04:56.495,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Even eight men to a cell had a toilet.

129
0:04:59.602,000 --> 0:05:01,000
That small detail changed the way we worked.

130
0:05:02.459,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Inmates and staff started interacting

131
0:05:04.189,000 --> 0:05:07,000
more often and openly and developing a rapport.

132
0:05:07.463,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It was easier to detect conflict and intervene

133
0:05:09.296,000 --> 0:05:1,000
before it escalated.

134
0:05:10.61,000 --> 0:05:13,000
The unit was cleaner, quieter, safer and more humane.

135
0:05:14.246,000 --> 0:05:16,000
This was more effective at keeping the peace

136
0:05:16.451,000 --> 0:05:19,000
than any intimidation technique I'd seen to that point.

137
0:05:19.96,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Interacting changes the way you behave,

138
0:05:21.388,000 --> 0:05:23,000
both for the officer and the inmate.

139
0:05:23.494,000 --> 0:05:26,000
We changed the environment and we changed the behavior.

140
0:05:26.644,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Now, just in case I hadn't learned this lesson,

141
0:05:28.537,000 --> 0:05:3,000
they assigned me to headquarters next,

142
0:05:30.947,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and that's where I ran straight up against system change.

143
0:05:33.473,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Now, many things work against system change:

144
0:05:36.042,000 --> 0:05:38,000
politics and politicians, bills and laws,

145
0:05:38.151,000 --> 0:05:4,000
courts and lawsuits, internal politics.

146
0:05:40.919,000 --> 0:05:42,000
System change is difficult and slow,

147
0:05:42.989,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and oftentimes it doesn't take you

148
0:05:44.531,000 --> 0:05:45,000
where you want to go.

149
0:05:46.214,000 --> 0:05:5,000
It's no small thing to change a prison system.

150
0:05:50.236,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So what I did do is I reflected on my earlier experiences

151
0:05:52.91,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and I remembered that when we interacted with offenders, the heat went down.

152
0:05:56.164,000 --> 0:05:57,000
When we changed the environment, the behavior changed.

153
0:05:58.155,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And these were not huge system changes.

154
0:05:59.944,000 --> 0:06:,000
These were small changes, and these changes

155
0:06:01.699,000 --> 0:06:03,000
created new possibilities.

156
0:06:03.91,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So next, I got reassigned as superintendent of a small prison.

157
0:06:06.617,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And at the same time, I was working on my degree

158
0:06:08.876,000 --> 0:06:1,000
at the Evergreen State College.

159
0:06:10.957,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I interacted with a lot of people who were not like me,

160
0:06:12.95,000 --> 0:06:13,000
people who had different ideas

161
0:06:14.32,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and came from different backgrounds.

162
0:06:16.026,000 --> 0:06:18,000
One of them was a rainforest ecologist.

163
0:06:18.622,000 --> 0:06:19,000
She looked at my small prison and what she saw

164
0:06:20.372,000 --> 0:06:21,000
was a laboratory.

165
0:06:22.158,000 --> 0:06:24,000
We talked and discovered how prisons and inmates

166
0:06:25.083,000 --> 0:06:27,000
could actually help advance science

167
0:06:27.115,000 --> 0:06:28,000
by helping them complete projects

168
0:06:28.744,000 --> 0:06:29,000
they couldn't complete on their own,

169
0:06:30.555,000 --> 0:06:32,000
like repopulating endangered species:

170
0:06:32.873,000 --> 0:06:35,000
frogs, butterflies, endangered prairie plants.

171
0:06:36.02,000 --> 0:06:37,000
At the same time, we found ways to make

172
0:06:37.347,000 --> 0:06:38,000
our operation more efficient

173
0:06:38.93,000 --> 0:06:4,000
through the addition of solar power,

174
0:06:41.153,000 --> 0:06:44,000
rainwater catchment, organic gardening, recycling.

175
0:06:44.683,000 --> 0:06:46,000
This initiative has led to many projects

176
0:06:47.182,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that have had huge system-wide impact,

177
0:06:48.884,000 --> 0:06:51,000
not just in our system, but in other state systems as well,

178
0:06:52.227,000 --> 0:06:54,000
small experiments making a big difference

179
0:06:54.423,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to science, to the community.

180
0:06:57.475,000 --> 0:07:,000
The way we think about our work changes our work.

181
0:07:00.642,000 --> 0:07:03,000
The project just made my job more interesting and exciting.

182
0:07:03.823,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I was excited. Staff were excited.

183
0:07:05.78,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Officers were excited. Inmates were excited.

184
0:07:07.79,000 --> 0:07:08,000
They were inspired.

185
0:07:09.543,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Everybody wanted to be part of this.

186
0:07:11.099,000 --> 0:07:13,000
They were making a contribution, a difference,

187
0:07:13.418,000 --> 0:07:15,000
one they thought was meaningful and important.

188
0:07:15.657,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Let me be clear on what's going on here, though.

189
0:07:17.513,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Inmates are highly adaptive.

190
0:07:19.256,000 --> 0:07:2,000
They have to be.

191
0:07:20.928,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Oftentimes, they know more about our own systems

192
0:07:23.689,000 --> 0:07:24,000
than the people who run them.

193
0:07:25.67,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And they're here for a reason.

194
0:07:27.321,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I don't see my job as to punish them or forgive them,

195
0:07:30.607,000 --> 0:07:31,000
but I do think they can have

196
0:07:31.87,000 --> 0:07:33,000
decent and meaningful lives even in prison.

197
0:07:34.623,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So that was the question:

198
0:07:36.2,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Could inmates live decent and meaningful lives,

199
0:07:39.38,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and if so, what difference would that make?

200
0:07:42.65,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So I took that question back to the deep end,

201
0:07:45.547,000 --> 0:07:47,000
where some of our most violent offenders are housed.

202
0:07:48.212,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Remember, IMUs are for punishment.

203
0:07:49.843,000 --> 0:07:51,000
You don't get perks there, like programming.

204
0:07:51.907,000 --> 0:07:52,000
That was how we thought.

205
0:07:53.837,000 --> 0:07:55,000
But then we started to realize that if any inmates

206
0:07:55.95,000 --> 0:07:57,000
needed programming, it was these particular inmates.

207
0:07:58.237,000 --> 0:08:,000
In fact, they needed intensive programming.

208
0:08:00.423,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So we changed our thinking 180 degrees,

209
0:08:02.761,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and we started looking for new possibilities.

210
0:08:05.124,000 --> 0:08:07,000
What we found was a new kind of chair.

211
0:08:07.662,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Instead of using the chair for punishment,

212
0:08:09.608,000 --> 0:08:1,000
we put it in classrooms.

213
0:08:11.278,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Okay, we didn't forget our responsibility to control,

214
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but now inmates could interact safely, face-to-face

215
0:08:16.559,000 --> 0:08:17,000
with other inmates and staff,

216
0:08:18.205,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and because control was no longer an issue,

217
0:08:19.84,000 --> 0:08:21,000
everybody could focus on other things,

218
0:08:22.13,000 --> 0:08:24,000
like learning. Behavior changed.

219
0:08:24.772,000 --> 0:08:28,000
We changed our thinking, and we changed what was possible, and this gives me hope.

220
0:08:29.607,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Now, I can't tell you that any of this stuff will work.

221
0:08:32.143,000 --> 0:08:34,000
What I can tell you, though, it is working.

222
0:08:34.735,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Our prisons are getting safer for both staff and inmates,

223
0:08:38.164,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and when our prisons are safe,

224
0:08:39.558,000 --> 0:08:42,000
we can put our energies into a lot more than just controlling.

225
0:08:43.013,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Reducing recidivism may be our ultimate goal,

226
0:08:45.295,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but it's not our only goal.

227
0:08:46.97,000 --> 0:08:47,000
To be honest with you, preventing crime

228
0:08:48.726,000 --> 0:08:49,000
takes so much more from so many more people

229
0:08:50.695,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and institutions.

230
0:08:52.208,000 --> 0:08:55,000
If we rely on just prisons to reduce crime,

231
0:08:55.476,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I'm afraid we'll never get there.

232
0:08:57.434,000 --> 0:08:58,000
But prisons can do some things

233
0:08:59.289,000 --> 0:09:,000
we never thought they could do.

234
0:09:00.965,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Prisons can be the source of innovation

235
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and sustainability,

236
0:09:04.381,000 --> 0:09:07,000
repopulating endangered species and environmental restoration.

237
0:09:07.74,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Inmates can be scientists and beekeepers,

238
0:09:10.385,000 --> 0:09:11,000
dog rescuers.

239
0:09:12.145,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Prisons can be the source of meaningful work

240
0:09:14.678,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and opportunity for staff

241
0:09:16.635,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and the inmates who live there.

242
0:09:18.976,000 --> 0:09:2,000
We can contain and control

243
0:09:21.15,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and provide humane environments.

244
0:09:23.273,000 --> 0:09:25,000
These are not opposing qualities.

245
0:09:25.864,000 --> 0:09:27,000
We can't wait 10 to 20 years to find out

246
0:09:28.165,000 --> 0:09:29,000
if this is worth doing.

247
0:09:29.752,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Our strategy is not massive system change.

248
0:09:32.446,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Our strategy is hundreds of small changes

249
0:09:34.25,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that take place in days or months, not years.

250
0:09:37.935,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We need more small pilots where we learn as we go,

251
0:09:41.332,000 --> 0:09:44,000
pilots that change the range of possibility.

252
0:09:44.333,000 --> 0:09:46,000
We need new and better ways to measure impacts

253
0:09:46.422,000 --> 0:09:47,000
on engagement, on interaction,

254
0:09:48.163,000 --> 0:09:5,000
on safe environments.

255
0:09:50.179,000 --> 0:09:52,000
We need more opportunities to participate in

256
0:09:52.499,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and contribute to our communities,

257
0:09:54.671,000 --> 0:09:56,000
your communities.

258
0:09:57.12,000 --> 0:10:,000
Prisons need to be secure, yes, safe, yes.

259
0:10:00.164,000 --> 0:10:,000
We can do that.

260
0:10:01.147,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Prisons need to provide humane environments

261
0:10:03.168,000 --> 0:10:05,000
where people can participate, contribute,

262
0:10:05.235,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and learn meaningful lives.

263
0:10:06.921,000 --> 0:10:07,000
We're learning how to do that.

264
0:10:08.77,000 --> 0:10:09,000
That's why I'm hopeful.

265
0:10:10.22,000 --> 0:10:12,000
We don't have to stay stuck in old ideas about prison.

266
0:10:12.511,000 --> 0:10:14,000
We can define that. We can create that.

267
0:10:14.975,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And when we do that thoughtfully and with humanity,

268
0:10:17.425,000 --> 0:10:18,000
prisons can be more than the bucket

269
0:10:19.362,000 --> 0:10:2,000
for failed social policy.

270
0:10:20.951,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Maybe finally, we will earn our title:

271
0:10:24.301,000 --> 0:10:25,000
a department of corrections.

272
0:10:26.296,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Thank you.

273
0:10:28.396,000 --> 0:10:3,000
(Applause)

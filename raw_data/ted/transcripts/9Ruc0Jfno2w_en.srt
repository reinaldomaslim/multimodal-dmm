1
0:00:13.016,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So what do people usually say when you're about to give a public talk?

2
0:00:17.159,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's to imagine that your audience is naked.

3
0:00:19.651,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:21.444,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Well, I'm doing a different trick tonight,

5
0:00:23.609,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and I'm going to imagine all of us without farmers,

6
0:00:27.18,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and well, it's not so much different.

7
0:00:29.895,000 --> 0:00:31,000
[Without farmers you'd be hungry, naked and sober]

8
0:00:32.348,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:33.373,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And our farmers do so much more for us

10
0:00:36.419,000 --> 0:00:4,000
than simply feed and clothe and provide us excellent things to drink.

11
0:00:41.776,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Our farmers are an important part of all of our communities,

12
0:00:45.485,000 --> 0:00:47,000
particularly our rural communities.

13
0:00:48.334,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And more than that,

14
0:00:50.191,000 --> 0:00:53,000
they're a strong driver of resilient economics.

15
0:00:54.739,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Think about it this way:

16
0:00:56.243,000 --> 0:00:59,000
When a brewer buys hops from me, grown here in Minnesota,

17
0:00:59.696,000 --> 0:01:01,000
90 percent of that dollar stays in our state,

18
0:01:02.068,000 --> 0:01:05,000
compared to just 10 percent when they buy it from somewhere else.

19
0:01:05.212,000 --> 0:01:06,000
What that means is a lot.

20
0:01:07.101,000 --> 0:01:09,000
That 90 percent means local jobs.

21
0:01:09.427,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It means tax revenue for better schools and roads.

22
0:01:12.394,000 --> 0:01:14,000
It means support for the co-ops, the mechanics,

23
0:01:14.696,000 --> 0:01:17,000
all the support staff that are needed for a farm to thrive.

24
0:01:18.743,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And they're our best stewards of the land.

25
0:01:20.8,000 --> 0:01:24,000
This quote, I think, exemplifies what our family farmers do for us

26
0:01:24.924,000 --> 0:01:26,000
in stewarding our shared natural resources.

27
0:01:28.14,000 --> 0:01:33,000
"That land is a community is the basic concept of ecology,

28
0:01:34.011,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but that land is to be loved and respected as an extension of ethics."

29
0:01:39.628,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Now, they sure do a lot of good stuff for us.

30
0:01:43.714,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And our family farmers are great, we'd all agree.

31
0:01:46.379,000 --> 0:01:47,000
However,

32
0:01:48.315,000 --> 0:01:5,000
the trends in agriculture today are dire.

33
0:01:50.783,000 --> 0:01:51,000
The average age of a farmer in America,

34
0:01:52.688,000 --> 0:01:54,000
according to the latest agricultural census --

35
0:01:55.434,000 --> 0:01:56,000
58.3.

36
0:01:56.958,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Of all the farmers,

37
0:01:58.91,000 --> 0:02:,000
33 percent are 65 plus.

38
0:02:01.393,000 --> 0:02:02,000
That's a little caricature of my grandpa.

39
0:02:03.403,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:04.751,000 --> 0:02:05,000
He's still farming,

41
0:02:06.372,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and he's much older than 65.

42
0:02:08.53,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But to put that in perspective,

43
0:02:10.031,000 --> 0:02:12,000
another important public service job, teaching,

44
0:02:12.886,000 --> 0:02:14,000
average age of teachers is 42.

45
0:02:15.95,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Our farmers are pretty old in this country.

46
0:02:18.307,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And unfortunately,

47
0:02:20.292,000 --> 0:02:23,000
when they retire, if they retire,

48
0:02:23.886,000 --> 0:02:24,000
we're not really replacing them.

49
0:02:25.792,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Of all the farmers that we added in this country

50
0:02:28.077,000 --> 0:02:3,000
between 2008 and 2012,

51
0:02:30.6,000 --> 0:02:32,000
across the entire United States --

52
0:02:32.719,000 --> 0:02:33,000
see if you can catch this difference --

53
0:02:34.637,000 --> 0:02:36,000
we added 2,000 under the age of 30.

54
0:02:37.393,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I'm one of those.

55
0:02:39.426,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I'll be around to autograph some photos later, if you'd like.

56
0:02:42.339,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:44.665,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But, you know, our farmers are getting older

58
0:02:46.793,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and we're not replacing them --

59
0:02:48.333,000 --> 0:02:49,000
what's going on here?

60
0:02:49.649,000 --> 0:02:5,000
What are we going to do?

61
0:02:51.061,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And I think there's a reason folks aren't coming into it,

62
0:02:53.784,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and that's prices.

63
0:02:54.967,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We're going to go through a couple of slides like this.

64
0:02:57.569,000 --> 0:03:,000
Milk: This is the average retail price of a gallon of milk in the United States.

65
0:03:01.37,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Four dollars forty-nine cents.

66
0:03:02.845,000 --> 0:03:03,000
How much do you think the farmer gets?

67
0:03:04.681,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Dollar thirty-two.

68
0:03:06.802,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We'll try again with bread.

69
0:03:08.157,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Average retail price of bread in America, three forty-nine.

70
0:03:10.958,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Farmer gets ...

71
0:03:12.295,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Twelve cents.

72
0:03:13.47,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Audience: Oh!

73
0:03:14.645,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And so how are we supposed to have strong local farms

74
0:03:19.342,000 --> 0:03:2,000
in this scenario?

75
0:03:20.536,000 --> 0:03:23,000
What are we supposed to do if there aren't any local farmers left?

76
0:03:25.206,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And this isn't just a farmer problem,

77
0:03:27.723,000 --> 0:03:3,000
it's not just something for the few of us farmers to sort out.

78
0:03:30.934,000 --> 0:03:31,000
This is an all-of-us problem.

79
0:03:32.347,000 --> 0:03:35,000
This is rural and it's urban and it's statewide and it's nationwide.

80
0:03:35.799,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So what do we do about it?

81
0:03:38.426,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I'll tell you that.

82
0:03:39.68,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But first, a story.

83
0:03:41.879,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The green movement, we're all kind of familiar,

84
0:03:44.745,000 --> 0:03:46,000
started in the '60s, planting trees.

85
0:03:47.417,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And now we've come such a long way.

86
0:03:49.212,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Green is part of our day-to-day lives.

87
0:03:51.512,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It's part of the day-to-day lives of Fortune 500 businesses.

88
0:03:54.544,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It's the subject of international treaties,

89
0:03:56.585,000 --> 0:03:58,000
the subject of presidential debates.

90
0:03:59.125,000 --> 0:04:,000
You and I, we switch our light bulbs,

91
0:04:01.101,000 --> 0:04:03,000
we use reusable bags.

92
0:04:03.744,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We participate in the green movement each and every day.

93
0:04:06.427,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Yet ...

94
0:04:07.784,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and this is how we get to the idea --

95
0:04:10.538,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the food movement,

96
0:04:11.713,000 --> 0:04:14,000
relatively younger, but also somewhat familiar, I imagine.

97
0:04:15.117,000 --> 0:04:16,000
You go to the grocery store,

98
0:04:16.498,000 --> 0:04:17,000
you see a sign that says "Buy local,"

99
0:04:18.331,000 --> 0:04:2,000
you go to the farmers market, you go to the co-op,

100
0:04:20.974,000 --> 0:04:22,000
you read books by prominent authors.

101
0:04:23.903,000 --> 0:04:24,000
The food movement to date

102
0:04:25.141,000 --> 0:04:27,000
could be summarized as voting with your fork.

103
0:04:28.053,000 --> 0:04:3,000
The idea is: you pull a dollar out of your wallet --

104
0:04:30.616,000 --> 0:04:32,000
how you spend that dollar affects the food system.

105
0:04:32.982,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It supports farmers close to home.

106
0:04:35.974,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And that's all well and good, but where are we going?

107
0:04:38.506,000 --> 0:04:4,000
How do we get to our renewable-energy moment

108
0:04:40.594,000 --> 0:04:41,000
like the green movement did?

109
0:04:41.958,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And this, I think, is what we need to do.

110
0:04:44.521,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Just voting with our fork is not solving the issues

111
0:04:47.433,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that our farmers are facing.

112
0:04:48.806,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And so we need to do more than that.

113
0:04:50.584,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I believe we must move on from just voting with our fork

114
0:04:53.521,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to voting with our vote.

115
0:04:55.421,000 --> 0:04:57,000
We need to take our dollars

116
0:04:58.302,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and continue to spend them locally.

117
0:05:00.011,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We also need to show up at the ballot box for our farmers.

118
0:05:03.167,000 --> 0:05:05,000
This is bigger than just buying local strawberries

119
0:05:05.54,000 --> 0:05:06,000
once a year at a pick-your-own.

120
0:05:07.341,000 --> 0:05:09,000
This is a year-round effort that we must make together

121
0:05:09.937,000 --> 0:05:1,000
to make the change we need.

122
0:05:11.793,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Changes like fair pricing for farmers.

123
0:05:14.348,000 --> 0:05:16,000
That's quotas, supply management,

124
0:05:16.603,000 --> 0:05:17,000
guaranteed prices.

125
0:05:18.792,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Changes like fair and open trade.

126
0:05:21.221,000 --> 0:05:22,000
That means ending trade wars.

127
0:05:23.499,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And yeah, of course it means voting.

128
0:05:26.324,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Now we all knew that one already, though.

129
0:05:28.301,000 --> 0:05:29,000
For example, it's working.

130
0:05:29.586,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Hey, who's that?

131
0:05:31.284,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Laughter)

132
0:05:32.982,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Just this year in Minnesota,

133
0:05:35.085,000 --> 0:05:37,000
we've passed a historic, first-in-the-country tax credit.

134
0:05:37.784,000 --> 0:05:39,000
The Beginning Farmer Tax Credit.

135
0:05:40.323,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It incentivizes our transition of land

136
0:05:42.546,000 --> 0:05:45,000
from the existing generation to the next generation.

137
0:05:46.125,000 --> 0:05:48,000
That was done by a handful of us young farmers --

138
0:05:48.776,000 --> 0:05:5,000
we certainly don't have money, you saw that earlier.

139
0:05:51.569,000 --> 0:05:52,000
We don't have political experience.

140
0:05:53.3,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But we showed up, and we made our voices heard.

141
0:05:55.554,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And thanks to the support of farmers and non-farmers alike,

142
0:05:58.458,000 --> 0:06:,000
we got something incredible done here in this state.

143
0:06:02.538,000 --> 0:06:03,000
If we can do it, anybody can do it.

144
0:06:04.506,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Now, that was all light and fuzzy and feels pretty happy.

145
0:06:07.815,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Skeptics in the audience, you're here.

146
0:06:10.116,000 --> 0:06:11,000
That would be me, if I were here.

147
0:06:11.761,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Skeptics are thinking,

148
0:06:13.007,000 --> 0:06:15,000
"Wow, what do we need to change about our food system?"

149
0:06:16.704,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Farmers are great.

150
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We have unlimited food, and it's real cheap, too,

151
0:06:20.617,000 --> 0:06:21,000
isn't that great?

152
0:06:22.45,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Well, unfortunately,

153
0:06:23.72,000 --> 0:06:27,000
in the '80s and the '90s in this country, we went down a path of policy

154
0:06:28.022,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that could be described as "get big or get out."

155
0:06:31.926,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And what "get big or get out" means is you maximize production

156
0:06:35.72,000 --> 0:06:36,000
while minimizing costs.

157
0:06:37.792,000 --> 0:06:39,000
On its face value, that sounds pretty simple.

158
0:06:40.53,000 --> 0:06:45,000
However, that shift turned our farmers from a venerated class

159
0:06:46.482,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and a valued class in our society

160
0:06:48.252,000 --> 0:06:49,000
into a cost to be minimized.

161
0:06:51.355,000 --> 0:06:53,000
That shift made it so that my great-grandfather,

162
0:06:54.03,000 --> 0:06:57,000
who supported the family with six cows,

163
0:06:57.31,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that same dairy,

164
0:06:59.228,000 --> 0:07:01,000
trying to support their family, has to be 600 cows today.

165
0:07:02.141,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Six-thousand-cow dairies are not unheard of.

166
0:07:07.446,000 --> 0:07:09,000
What happens when there's this one dairy farm

167
0:07:09.573,000 --> 0:07:1,000
in an entire county,

168
0:07:10.772,000 --> 0:07:11,000
where there used to be hundreds?

169
0:07:12.954,000 --> 0:07:15,000
The same could be said with corn or beans or field crops.

170
0:07:17.116,000 --> 0:07:2,000
What happens when it takes 10,000 acres for one person to support themselves?

171
0:07:21.871,000 --> 0:07:22,000
When it used to only take 40.

172
0:07:25.038,000 --> 0:07:27,000
We know what happens, we read about it in the news.

173
0:07:28.448,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Broadly determined, rural decline,

174
0:07:30.092,000 --> 0:07:31,000
but schools close, schools consolidate,

175
0:07:32.007,000 --> 0:07:34,000
post offices close, grocery stores close.

176
0:07:35.649,000 --> 0:07:36,000
People leave,

177
0:07:36.871,000 --> 0:07:38,000
the community suffers and goes away.

178
0:07:40.109,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I believe all of us in this audience with ties to rural Minnesota

179
0:07:43.228,000 --> 0:07:44,000
know this story well.

180
0:07:46.117,000 --> 0:07:5,000
This is not a problem that we can solve with farmers markets and good intentions.

181
0:07:51.022,000 --> 0:07:53,000
We have to do more for our farmers.

182
0:07:53.632,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Policy got us into this mess,

183
0:07:55.919,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and policy can get us out.

184
0:07:59.109,000 --> 0:08:03,000
American farmers are only getting older, fewer and poorer,

185
0:08:04.163,000 --> 0:08:06,000
yet they are crucial to our state.

186
0:08:06.782,000 --> 0:08:08,000
They're the vibrancy in our rural communities.

187
0:08:09.21,000 --> 0:08:12,000
They're the drivers of economic growth and stability,

188
0:08:12.576,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and they are our best protectors of our shared resources

189
0:08:16.378,000 --> 0:08:17,000
of land, water and air.

190
0:08:18.268,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So we have to do better for them.

191
0:08:20.331,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So join me, would you?

192
0:08:22.22,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Let's fight for our farmers.

193
0:08:23.752,000 --> 0:08:24,000
You can see it,

194
0:08:24.927,000 --> 0:08:27,000
we're already doing it in Minnesota, having great success.

195
0:08:28.736,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And together, we can do even more.

196
0:08:30.593,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And we must.

197
0:08:31.839,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So we were voting with our fork before,

198
0:08:35.178,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and we want to keep doing that.

199
0:08:36.994,000 --> 0:08:38,000
But if I could have one idea for you to go home with today,

200
0:08:39.901,000 --> 0:08:4,000
it's vote with your vote.

201
0:08:41.726,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And so to that end,

202
0:08:43.02,000 --> 0:08:46,000
on the count of three, I'd like all of us to say it together.

203
0:08:46.118,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Are you ready?

204
0:08:48.477,000 --> 0:08:49,000
OK, one,

205
0:08:50.469,000 --> 0:08:51,000
two,

206
0:08:51.889,000 --> 0:08:52,000
three.

207
0:08:53.076,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Audience: Vote with your vote.

208
0:08:55.325,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Very nice, thank you.

209
0:08:56.516,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I think you got it.

210
0:08:57.81,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Applause)

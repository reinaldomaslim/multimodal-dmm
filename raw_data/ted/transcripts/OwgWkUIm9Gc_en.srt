0:00:15.679,000 --> 0:00:17,000
One day in 1819,

3
0:00:18.025,000 --> 0:00:2,000
3,000 miles off the coast of Chile,

4
0:00:20.784,000 --> 0:00:22,000
in one of the most remote regions of the Pacific Ocean,

5
0:00:23.714,000 --> 0:00:27,000
20 American sailors watched their ship flood with seawater.

6
0:00:27.754,000 --> 0:00:29,000
They'd been struck by a sperm whale, which had ripped

7
0:00:29.934,000 --> 0:00:31,000
a catastrophic hole in the ship's hull.

8
0:00:32.835,000 --> 0:00:34,000
As their ship began to sink beneath the swells,

9
0:00:35.164,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the men huddled together in three small whaleboats.

10
0:00:39.477,000 --> 0:00:41,000
These men were 10,000 miles from home,

11
0:00:41.74,000 --> 0:00:44,000
more than 1,000 miles from the nearest scrap of land.

12
0:00:44.963,000 --> 0:00:46,000
In their small boats, they carried only

13
0:00:47.167,000 --> 0:00:48,000
rudimentary navigational equipment

14
0:00:48.733,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and limited supplies of food and water.

15
0:00:52.381,000 --> 0:00:54,000
These were the men of the whaleship Essex,

16
0:00:54.585,000 --> 0:00:56,000
whose story would later inspire parts of "Moby Dick."

17
0:00:57.24,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Even in today's world, their situation would be really dire,

18
0:01:00.189,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but think about how much worse it would have been then.

19
0:01:02.115,000 --> 0:01:05,000
No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong.

20
0:01:05.34,000 --> 0:01:07,000
No search party was coming to look for these men.

21
0:01:08.252,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So most of us have never experienced a situation

22
0:01:11.114,000 --> 0:01:14,000
as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves,

23
0:01:14.617,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but we all know what it's like to be afraid.

24
0:01:16.484,000 --> 0:01:18,000
We know how fear feels,

25
0:01:18.778,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but I'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about

26
0:01:20.882,000 --> 0:01:21,000
what our fears mean.

27
0:01:22.527,000 --> 0:01:24,000
As we grow up, we're often encouraged to think of fear

28
0:01:25.364,000 --> 0:01:27,000
as a weakness, just another childish thing to discard

29
0:01:28.277,000 --> 0:01:3,000
like baby teeth or roller skates.

30
0:01:31.095,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And I think it's no accident that we think this way.

31
0:01:33.59,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings

32
0:01:36.197,000 --> 0:01:38,000
are hard-wired to be optimists.

33
0:01:38.936,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So maybe that's why we think of fear, sometimes,

34
0:01:41.719,000 --> 0:01:42,000
as a danger in and of itself.

35
0:01:43.697,000 --> 0:01:45,000
"Don't worry," we like to say to one another. "Don't panic."

36
0:01:46.694,000 --> 0:01:48,000
In English, fear is something we conquer.

37
0:01:49.343,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It's something we fight. It's something we overcome.

38
0:01:53.176,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But what if we looked at fear in a fresh way?

39
0:01:55.381,000 --> 0:01:59,000
What if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination,

40
0:01:59.524,000 --> 0:02:01,000
something that can be as profound and insightful

41
0:02:01.902,000 --> 0:02:03,000
as storytelling itself?

42
0:02:04.556,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination

43
0:02:07.149,000 --> 0:02:1,000
in young children, whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid.

44
0:02:10.428,000 --> 0:02:12,000
When I was a child, I lived in California,

45
0:02:12.709,000 --> 0:02:14,000
which is, you know, mostly a very nice place to live,

46
0:02:15.398,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but for me as a child, California could also be a little scary.

47
0:02:19.406,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I remember how frightening it was to see the chandelier

48
0:02:22.447,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that hung above our dining table swing back and forth

49
0:02:24.88,000 --> 0:02:26,000
during every minor earthquake,

50
0:02:27.055,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and I sometimes couldn't sleep at night, terrified

51
0:02:29.358,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that the Big One might strike while we were sleeping.

52
0:02:31.879,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And what we say about kids who have fears like that

53
0:02:34.751,000 --> 0:02:37,000
is that they have a vivid imagination.

54
0:02:37.979,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But at a certain point, most of us learn

55
0:02:40.369,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up.

56
0:02:43.255,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed,

57
0:02:46.012,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and not every earthquake brings buildings down.

58
0:02:48.992,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But maybe it's no coincidence that some of our most creative minds

59
0:02:52.4,000 --> 0:02:55,000
fail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults.

60
0:02:55.511,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The same incredible imaginations that produced "The Origin of Species,"

61
0:02:59.372,000 --> 0:03:01,000
"Jane Eyre" and "The Remembrance of Things Past,"

62
0:03:02.229,000 --> 0:03:05,000
also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives

63
0:03:05.568,000 --> 0:03:09,000

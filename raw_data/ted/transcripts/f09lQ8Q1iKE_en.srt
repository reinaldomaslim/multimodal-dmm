1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
My work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously,

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
on a collective level.

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And what I mean by that, it's the behaviors

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that we're in denial about,

5
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness.

6
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And as individuals, we all do these things, all the time, everyday.

7
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It's like when you're mean to your wife

8
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
because you're mad at somebody else.

9
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Or when you drink a little too much at a party, just out of anxiety.

10
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt, or whatever.

11
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And when we do these kind of things,

12
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
when 300 million people do unconscious behaviors,

13
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
then it can add up to a catastrophic consequence

14
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that nobody wants, and no one intended.

15
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
And that's what I look at with my photographic work.

16
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
This is an image I just recently completed, that is --

17
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
when you stand back at a distance,

18
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
it looks like some kind of neo-Gothic, cartoon image

19
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
of a factory spewing out pollution.

20
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And as you get a little bit closer,

21
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
it starts looking like lots of pipes, like maybe a chemical plant,

22
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
or a refinery, or maybe a hellish freeway interchange.

23
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And as you get all the way up close,

24
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
you realize that it's actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups.

25
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And in fact, this is one million plastic cups,

26
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights

27
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
in the United States every six hours.

28
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
We use four million cups a day on airline flights,

29
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and virtually none of them are reused or recycled.

30
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
They just don't do that in that industry.

31
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Now, that number is dwarfed

32
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
by the number of paper cups we use every day,

33
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and that is 40 million cups a day for hot beverages,

34
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
most of which is coffee.

35
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I couldn't fit 40 million cups on a canvas,

36
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
but I was able to put 410,000. That's what 410,000 cups looks like.

37
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
That's 15 minutes of our cup consumption.

38
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life,

39
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that's the size it would be.

40
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And there's an hour's worth of our cups.

41
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And there's a day's worth of our cups.

42
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
You can still see the little people way down there.

43
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
That's as high as a 42-story building,

44
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and I put the Statue of Liberty in there as a scale reference.

45
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Speaking of justice, there's another phenomenon going on in our culture

46
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that I find deeply troubling, and that is that America, right now,

47
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
has the largest percentage of its population in prison

48
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
of any country on Earth.

49
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
One out of four people, one out of four humans in prison

50
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
are Americans, imprisoned in our country.

51
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And I wanted to show the number.

52
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The number is 2.3 million Americans were incarcerated in 2005.

53
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And that's gone up since then, but we don't have the numbers yet.

54
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So, I wanted to show 2.3 million prison uniforms,

55
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and in the actual print of this piece,

56
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge.

57
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
They're tiny. They're barely visible as a piece of material,

58
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and to show 2.3 million of them required a canvas

59
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that was larger than any printer in the world would print.

60
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And so I had to divide it up into multiple panels

61
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that are 10 feet tall by 25 feet wide.

62
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
This is that piece installed in a gallery in New York --

63
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
those are my parents looking at the piece.

64
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Every time I look at this piece,

66
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I always wonder if my mom's whispering to my dad,

67
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
"He finally folded his laundry."

68
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I want to show you some pieces now that are about addiction.

70
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And this particular one is about cigarette addiction.

71
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of Americans

72
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
who die from cigarette smoking.

73
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
More than 400,000 people die in the United States every year

74
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
from smoking cigarettes.

75
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And so, this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes.

76
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And, as you slowly step back,

77
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
you see that it's a painting by Van Gogh, called "Skull with Cigarette."

78
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
It's a strange thing to think about, that on 9/11,

79
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
when that tragedy happened, 3,000 Americans died.

80
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And do you remember the response?

81
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It reverberated around the world,

82
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and will continue to reverberate through time.

83
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It will be something that we talk about in 100 years.

84
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And yet on that same day, 1,100 Americans died from smoking.

85
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And the day after that, another 1,100 Americans died from smoking.

86
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And every single day since then, 1,100 Americans have died.

87
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And today, 1,100 Americans are dying from cigarette smoking.

88
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And we aren't talking about it -- we dismiss it.

89
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
The tobacco lobby, it's too strong.

90
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
We just dismiss it out of our consciousness.

91
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And knowing what we know about the destructive power of cigarettes,

92
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
we continue to allow our children, our sons and daughters,

93
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking.

94
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And this is what the next piece is about.

95
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
This is just lots and lots of cigarettes: 65,000 cigarettes,

96
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
which is equal to the number of teenagers

97
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
who will start smoking this month, and every month in the U.S.

98
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
More than 700,000 children in the United States aged 18 and under

99
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
begin smoking every year.

100
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
One more strange epidemic in the United States

101
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that I want to acquaint you with

102
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
is this phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drugs.

103
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
This is an image I've made out of lots and lots of Vicodin.

104
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Well, actually, I only had one Vicodin

105
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that I scanned lots and lots of times.

106
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And so, as you stand back, you see 213,000 Vicodin pills,

108
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
which is the number of hospital emergency room visits

109
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
yearly in the United States,

110
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers

111
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and anti-anxiety medications.

112
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
One-third of all drug overdoses in the U.S. --

113
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and that includes cocaine, heroin, alcohol, everything --

114
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
one-third of drug overdoses are prescription medications.

115
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
A strange phenomenon.

116
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
This is a piece that I just recently completed

117
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
about another tragic phenomenon. And that is the phenomenon,

118
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery.

119
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
384,000 women, American women, last year

120
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
went in for elective breast augmentation surgery.

121
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's rapidly becoming the most popular high school graduation gift,

122
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
given to young girls who are about to go off to college.

123
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So, I made this image out of Barbie dolls,

124
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and so, as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern,

125
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and as you get all the way back, you see 32,000 Barbie dolls,

126
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries

127
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that are performed in the U.S. each month.

128
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
The vast majority of those are on women under the age of 21.

129
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And strangely enough, the only plastic surgery

130
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction,

131
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and most of that is being done by men.

132
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Now, I want to emphasize that these are just examples.

133
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I'm not holding these out as being the biggest issues.

134
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
They're just examples.

135
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And the reason that I do this, it's because I have this fear

136
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now.

137
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
There's this kind of anesthesia in America at the moment.

138
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We've lost our sense of outrage, our anger and our grief

139
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
about what's going on in our culture right now,

140
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
what's going on in our country,

141
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world.

142
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
They've gone missing; these feelings have gone missing.

143
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Our cultural joy, our national joy is nowhere to be seen.

144
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And one of the causes of this, I think,

145
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of worldview,

146
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
this holoptical worldview, this holographic image

147
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that we're all trying to create in our mind

148
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
of the interconnection of things: the environmental footprints

149
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
1,000 miles away of the things that we buy;

150
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the social consequences 10,000 miles away

151
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
of the daily decisions that we make as consumers.

152
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
As we try to build this view,

153
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture,

154
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
the information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers:

155
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
numbers in the millions, in the hundreds of millions,

156
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
in the billions and now in the trillions.

157
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Bush's new budget is in the trillions, and these are numbers

158
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that our brain just doesn't have the ability to comprehend.

159
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
We can't make meaning out of these enormous statistics.

160
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And so that's what I'm trying to do with my work,

161
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
is to take these numbers, these statistics

162
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
from the raw language of data, and to translate them

163
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
into a more universal visual language, that can be felt.

164
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Because my belief is, if we can feel these issues,

165
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
if we can feel these things more deeply,

166
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
then they'll matter to us more than they do now.

167
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And if we can find that,

168
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
then we'll be able to find, within each one of us,

169
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
what it is that we need to find to face the big question,

170
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
which is: how do we change?

171
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
That, to me, is the big question that we face as a people right now:

172
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
how do we change? How do we change as a culture,

173
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and how do we each individually take responsibility

174
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of,

175
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and that is our own behavior?

176
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
My belief is that you don't have to make yourself bad

177
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
to look at these issues.

178
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I'm not pointing the finger at America in a blaming way.

179
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I'm simply saying, this is who we are right now.

180
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And if there are things that we see

181
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that we don't like about our culture,

182
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
then we have a choice.

183
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
The degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface,

184
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to bring to this question, the depth of character that we can summon,

185
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
as we show up for the question of how do we change --

186
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
it's already defining us as individuals and as a nation,

187
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and it will continue to do that, on into the future.

188
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And it will profoundly affect the well-being, the quality of life

189
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
of the billions of people

190
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
who are going to inherit the results of our decisions.

191
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I'm not speaking abstractly about this,

192
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I'm speaking -- this is who we are in this room,

193
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
right now, in this moment.

194
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Thank you and good afternoon.

195
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000

1
0:00:12.285,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm going to talk about hackers.

2
0:00:14.359,000 --> 0:00:15,000
And the image that comes to your mind

3
0:00:16.279,000 --> 0:00:18,000
when I say that word is probably not

4
0:00:18.738,000 --> 0:00:19,000
of Benjamin Franklin,

5
0:00:20.255,000 --> 0:00:23,000
but I'm going to explain to you why it should be.

6
0:00:23.443,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The image that comes to your mind

7
0:00:24.92,000 --> 0:00:26,000
is probably more likely of a pasty kid

8
0:00:27.606,000 --> 0:00:29,000
sitting in a basement doing something mischievous,

9
0:00:30.122,000 --> 0:00:34,000
or of a shady criminal who is trying to steal your identity,

10
0:00:34.257,000 --> 0:00:37,000
or of an international rogue

11
0:00:37.28,000 --> 0:00:39,000
with a political agenda.

12
0:00:39.991,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea

13
0:00:44.524,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that hackers are people that we should be afraid of.

14
0:00:49.033,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But like most things in technology

15
0:00:50.665,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and the technology world,

16
0:00:52.114,000 --> 0:00:55,000
hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil.

17
0:00:55.289,000 --> 0:00:57,000
For every hacker that's trying to steal your identity

18
0:00:57.723,000 --> 0:00:59,000
there's one that's building a tool

19
0:00:59.961,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that will help you find your loved ones after a disaster

20
0:01:03.092,000 --> 0:01:06,000
or to monitor environmental quality

21
0:01:06.571,000 --> 0:01:08,000
after an oil spill.

22
0:01:09.308,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Hacking is really just any amateur innovation

23
0:01:13.18,000 --> 0:01:14,000
on an existing system,

24
0:01:14.576,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and it is a deeply democratic activity.

25
0:01:17.406,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It's about critical thinking.

26
0:01:18.805,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It's about questioning existing ways of doing things.

27
0:01:21.839,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It's the idea that if you see a problem, you work to fix it,

28
0:01:25.227,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and not just complain about it.

29
0:01:27.258,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And in many ways, hacking is what built America.

30
0:01:31.168,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Betsy Ross was a hacker.

31
0:01:33.313,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack.

32
0:01:36.508,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs,

33
0:01:39.384,000 --> 0:01:41,000
hacking has always been at the foundation

34
0:01:41.923,000 --> 0:01:44,000
of American democracy.

35
0:01:44.975,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So if there's one thing I want to leave you here with today,

36
0:01:49.276,000 --> 0:01:51,000
it's that the next time you think about who a hacker is,

37
0:01:51.847,000 --> 0:01:55,000
you think not of this guy

38
0:01:55.869,000 --> 0:01:57,000
but of this guy, Benjamin Franklin,

39
0:01:58.449,000 --> 0:02:,000
who was one of the greatest hackers of all time.

40
0:02:01.407,000 --> 0:02:03,000
He was one of America's most prolific inventors,

41
0:02:03.548,000 --> 0:02:05,000
though he famously never filed a patent,

42
0:02:05.73,000 --> 0:02:06,000
because he thought that all human knowledge

43
0:02:07.324,000 --> 0:02:09,000
should be freely available.

44
0:02:09.952,000 --> 0:02:12,000
He brought us bifocals and the lightning rod,

45
0:02:12.984,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and of course there was his collaboration

46
0:02:15.181,000 --> 0:02:17,000
on the invention of American democracy.

47
0:02:18.146,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And in Code For America, we really try to embody

48
0:02:20.469,000 --> 0:02:22,000
the spirit of Ben Franklin.

49
0:02:22.487,000 --> 0:02:25,000
He was a tinkerer and a statesman

50
0:02:25.929,000 --> 0:02:26,000
whose conception of citizenship

51
0:02:27.789,000 --> 0:02:29,000
was always predicated on action.

52
0:02:29.876,000 --> 0:02:31,000
He believed that government could be built

53
0:02:32.661,000 --> 0:02:33,000
by the people,

54
0:02:34.301,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and we call those people civic hackers.

55
0:02:38.85,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So it's no wonder that the values

56
0:02:41.305,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that underly a healthy democracy,

57
0:02:43.973,000 --> 0:02:45,000
like collaboration and empowerment

58
0:02:46.966,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and participation and enterprise,

59
0:02:49.029,000 --> 0:02:52,000
are the same values that underly the Internet.

60
0:02:52.515,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And so it's no surprise that many hackers

61
0:02:54.611,000 --> 0:02:57,000
are turning their attention to the problem of government.

62
0:02:57.968,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But before I give you a few examples

63
0:03:00.021,000 --> 0:03:01,000
of what civic hacking looks like,

64
0:03:01.843,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I want to make clear that you don't have

65
0:03:03.359,000 --> 0:03:05,000
to be a programmer to be a civic hacker.

66
0:03:05.453,000 --> 0:03:06,000
You just have to believe that you can bring

67
0:03:07.208,000 --> 0:03:09,000
a 21st-century tool set to bear

68
0:03:09.475,000 --> 0:03:11,000
on the problems that government faces.

69
0:03:11.914,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And we hear all the time from our community

70
0:03:13.959,000 --> 0:03:15,000
of civic hackers at Code for America

71
0:03:16.247,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that they didn't understand how much nontechnical work

72
0:03:18.855,000 --> 0:03:2,000
actually went into civic hacking projects.

73
0:03:20.881,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So keep that in mind.

74
0:03:22.372,000 --> 0:03:26,000
All of you are potential civic hackers.

75
0:03:26.462,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So what does civic hacking look like?

76
0:03:28.482,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Our team last year in Honolulu,

77
0:03:30.746,000 --> 0:03:32,000
which in this case was three full-time fellows

78
0:03:33.361,000 --> 0:03:35,000
who were doing a year of public service,

79
0:03:35.513,000 --> 0:03:38,000
were asked by the city to rebuild the website.

80
0:03:39.478,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And it's a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages

81
0:03:42.557,000 --> 0:03:44,000
which just wasn't going to be possible

82
0:03:44.673,000 --> 0:03:45,000
in the few months that they had.

83
0:03:46.426,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So instead, they decided to build a parallel site

84
0:03:48.883,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that better conformed to how citizens actually

85
0:03:51.345,000 --> 0:03:54,000
want to interact with information on a city website.

86
0:03:54.684,000 --> 0:03:55,000
They're looking for answers to questions,

87
0:03:56.621,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and they want to take action when they're done,

88
0:03:59.247,000 --> 0:04:01,000
which is really hard to do from a site

89
0:04:01.533,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that looks like this.

90
0:04:03.182,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So our team built Honolulu Answers,

91
0:04:05.427,000 --> 0:04:07,000
which is a super-simple search interface

92
0:04:07.793,000 --> 0:04:09,000
where you enter a search term or a question

93
0:04:10.246,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and get back plain language answers

94
0:04:12.944,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that drive a user towards action.

95
0:04:15.384,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Now the site itself was easy enough to build,

96
0:04:18.241,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but the team was faced with the challenge

97
0:04:20.144,000 --> 0:04:22,000
of how they populate all of the content.

98
0:04:22.854,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It would have taken the three of them

99
0:04:24.53,000 --> 0:04:25,000
a very long time,

100
0:04:25.907,000 --> 0:04:27,000
especially given that none of them are actually from Honolulu.

101
0:04:28.906,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And so they did something that's really radical,

102
0:04:30.981,000 --> 0:04:31,000
when you think about how government

103
0:04:32.654,000 --> 0:04:34,000
is used to working.

104
0:04:34.695,000 --> 0:04:37,000
They asked citizens to write the content.

105
0:04:37.707,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So you've heard of a hack-a-thon.

106
0:04:39.201,000 --> 0:04:4,000
They held a write-a-thon,

107
0:04:40.865,000 --> 0:04:42,000
where on one Saturday afternoon --

108
0:04:43.502,000 --> 0:04:45,000
("What do I do about wild pigs being a nuisance?") (Laughter) —

109
0:04:45.543,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Wild pigs are a huge problem in Honolulu, apparently.

110
0:04:49.589,000 --> 0:04:51,000
In one Saturday afternoon,

111
0:04:51.632,000 --> 0:04:53,000
they were able to populate most of the content

112
0:04:53.966,000 --> 0:04:54,000
for most of the frequently asked questions,

113
0:04:55.627,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but more importantly than that,

114
0:04:57.86,000 --> 0:05:01,000
they created a new way for citizens to participate in their government.

115
0:05:01.975,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Now, I think this is a really cool story in and of itself,

116
0:05:05.02,000 --> 0:05:07,000
but it gets more awesome.

117
0:05:07.357,000 --> 0:05:09,000
On the National Day of Civic Hacking

118
0:05:09.963,000 --> 0:05:11,000
this past June in Oakland, where I live,

119
0:05:12.374,000 --> 0:05:14,000
the Code For America team in Oakland

120
0:05:14.403,000 --> 0:05:16,000
took the open source code base of Honolulu Answers

121
0:05:16.603,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and turned it into Oakland Answers,

122
0:05:18.614,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and again we held a write-a-thon

123
0:05:20.693,000 --> 0:05:23,000
where we took the most frequently asked questions

124
0:05:24.041,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and had citizens write the answers to them,

125
0:05:25.703,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and I got into the act.

126
0:05:27.172,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I authored this answer, and a few others.

127
0:05:30.773,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And I'm trying to this day to articulate

128
0:05:33.885,000 --> 0:05:36,000
the sense of empowerment and responsibility

129
0:05:36.931,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that I feel for the place that I live

130
0:05:40.511,000 --> 0:05:44,000
based simply on this small act of participation.

131
0:05:44.553,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And by stitching together my small act

132
0:05:48.278,000 --> 0:05:5,000
with the thousands of other small acts of participation

133
0:05:51.084,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that we're enabling through civic hacking,

134
0:05:53.665,000 --> 0:05:55,000
we think we can reenergize citizenship

135
0:05:56.449,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and restore trust in government.

136
0:05:59.499,000 --> 0:06:,000
At this point, you may be wondering

137
0:06:00.836,000 --> 0:06:01,000
what city officials think of all this.

138
0:06:02.562,000 --> 0:06:03,000
They actually love it.

139
0:06:04.115,000 --> 0:06:06,000
As most of you guys know, cities are being asked

140
0:06:06.309,000 --> 0:06:08,000
every day to do more with less,

141
0:06:09.03,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and they're always looking for innovative solutions

142
0:06:11.228,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to entrenched problems.

143
0:06:12.962,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So when you give citizens a way to participate

144
0:06:16.496,000 --> 0:06:17,000
beyond attending a town hall meeting,

145
0:06:18.334,000 --> 0:06:19,000
cities can actually capture

146
0:06:20.286,000 --> 0:06:22,000
the capacity in their communities

147
0:06:23.04,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to do the business of government.

148
0:06:26.075,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Now I don't want to leave the impression

149
0:06:28.068,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that civic hacking is just an American phenomenon.

150
0:06:30.18,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It's happening across the globe,

151
0:06:31.883,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and one of my favorite examples

152
0:06:33.536,000 --> 0:06:35,000
is from Mexico City, where earlier this year,

153
0:06:35.967,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the Mexico House of Representatives

154
0:06:38.077,000 --> 0:06:42,000
entered into a contract with a software development firm

155
0:06:42.389,000 --> 0:06:45,000
to build an app that legislators would use

156
0:06:45.569,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to track bills.

157
0:06:46.82,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So this was just for the handful of legislators

158
0:06:49.496,000 --> 0:06:51,000
in the House.

159
0:06:52.07,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And the contract was a two-year contract

160
0:06:54.739,000 --> 0:06:57,000
for 9.3 million dollars.

161
0:06:58.665,000 --> 0:07:,000
Now a lot of people were really angry about this,

162
0:07:01.017,000 --> 0:07:03,000
especially geeks who knew that 9.3 million dollars

163
0:07:03.964,000 --> 0:07:05,000
was an absolutely outrageous amount of money

164
0:07:06.268,000 --> 0:07:07,000
for what was a very simple app.

165
0:07:08.239,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But instead of taking to the streets,

166
0:07:10.668,000 --> 0:07:12,000
they issued a challenge.

167
0:07:12.876,000 --> 0:07:14,000
They asked programmers in Mexico

168
0:07:15.707,000 --> 0:07:18,000
to build something better and cheaper,

169
0:07:18.91,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and they offered a prize of 9,300 dollars --

170
0:07:23.361,000 --> 0:07:24,000
10,000 times cheaper

171
0:07:25.262,000 --> 0:07:26,000
than the government contract,

172
0:07:26.91,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and they gave the entrants 10 days.

173
0:07:30.013,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And in those 10 days,

174
0:07:31.825,000 --> 0:07:35,000
they submitted 173 apps,

175
0:07:35.886,000 --> 0:07:37,000
five of which were presented to Congress

176
0:07:38.52,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and are still in the app store today.

177
0:07:40.621,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And because of this action,

178
0:07:42.442,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that contract was vacated,

179
0:07:44.57,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City

180
0:07:46.702,000 --> 0:07:47,000
which is home to one of our partners,

181
0:07:48.459,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Code for Mexico City.

182
0:07:50.917,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And so what you see in all three of these places,

183
0:07:53.668,000 --> 0:07:55,000
in Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City,

184
0:07:56.485,000 --> 0:07:59,000
are the elements that are at the core of civic hacking.

185
0:07:59.676,000 --> 0:08:02,000
It's citizens who saw things that could be working better

186
0:08:02.699,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and they decided to fix them,

187
0:08:04.63,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and through that work, they're creating

188
0:08:06.289,000 --> 0:08:09,000
a 21st-century ecosystem of participation.

189
0:08:09.48,000 --> 0:08:11,000
They're creating a whole new set of ways

190
0:08:11.51,000 --> 0:08:13,000
for citizens to be involved,

191
0:08:13.516,000 --> 0:08:16,000
besides voting or signing a petition or protesting.

192
0:08:17.461,000 --> 0:08:2,000
They can actually build government.

193
0:08:21.438,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So back to our friend Ben Franklin,

194
0:08:24.574,000 --> 0:08:26,000
who, one of his lesser-known accomplishments

195
0:08:27.32,000 --> 0:08:3,000
was that in 1736 he founded

196
0:08:31.195,000 --> 0:08:34,000
the first volunteer firefighting company in Philadelphia,

197
0:08:34.753,000 --> 0:08:35,000
called a brigade.

198
0:08:36.452,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And it's because he and his friends noticed

199
0:08:38.678,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that the city was having trouble keeping up

200
0:08:40.377,000 --> 0:08:42,000
with all the fires that were happening in the city,

201
0:08:42.447,000 --> 0:08:44,000
so in true civic hacker fashion,

202
0:08:45.236,000 --> 0:08:47,000
they built a solution.

203
0:08:47.886,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And we have our own brigades at Code for America

204
0:08:50.396,000 --> 0:08:53,000
working on the projects that I've just described,

205
0:08:53.542,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and we want to ask you

206
0:08:55.28,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to follow in Ben Franklin's footsteps

207
0:08:57.742,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and come join us.

208
0:08:59.209,000 --> 0:09:01,000
We have 31 brigades in the U.S.

209
0:09:01.499,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We are pleased to announce today

210
0:09:02.767,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that we're opening up the brigade to international cities

211
0:09:05.043,000 --> 0:09:06,000
for the first time,

212
0:09:06.635,000 --> 0:09:09,000
starting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland.

213
0:09:10.616,000 --> 0:09:12,000
You can find out if there's a brigade where you live

214
0:09:12.715,000 --> 0:09:14,000
at brigade.codeforamerica.org,

215
0:09:15.209,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and if there's not a brigade where you live, we will help you.

216
0:09:17.648,000 --> 0:09:18,000
We've created a tool kit which also lives

217
0:09:19.504,000 --> 0:09:2,000
at brigade.codeforamerica.org,

218
0:09:21.068,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and we will support you along the way.

219
0:09:23.608,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Our goal is to create a global network of civic hackers

220
0:09:27.523,000 --> 0:09:29,000
who are innovating on the existing system

221
0:09:30.276,000 --> 0:09:32,000
in order to build tools that will solve

222
0:09:33.236,000 --> 0:09:34,000
entrenched problems,

223
0:09:35.102,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that will support local government,

224
0:09:37.129,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and that will empower citizens.

225
0:09:38.688,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So please come hack with us.

226
0:09:41.063,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Thank you.

227
0:09:42.611,000 --> 0:09:44,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.063,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It was April 8, 2003.

2
0:00:17.856,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I was in Baghdad, covering the war in Iraq.

3
0:00:22.405,000 --> 0:00:26,000
That day, Americans tanks started arriving in Baghdad.

4
0:00:28.039,000 --> 0:00:33,000
We were just a few journalists in the Palestine Hotel,

5
0:00:35.435,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and, as happens in war,

6
0:00:37.882,000 --> 0:00:4,000
the fighting began to approach outside our windows.

7
0:00:42.327,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Baghdad was covered in black smoke and oil.

8
0:00:46.955,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It smelled awful.

9
0:00:48.137,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We couldn't see a thing, but we knew what was happening.

10
0:00:50.852,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Of course, I was supposed to be writing an article,

11
0:00:53.366,000 --> 0:00:54,000
but that's how it always goes --

12
0:00:54.926,000 --> 0:00:56,000
you're supposed to be writing and something big happens.

13
0:00:57.588,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So I was in my room on the 16th floor,

14
0:01:00.339,000 --> 0:01:02,000
writing and looking out the window every now and then

15
0:01:03.245,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to see what was happening.

16
0:01:05.053,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Suddenly, there was a huge explosion.

17
0:01:07.547,000 --> 0:01:08,000
During the previous three weeks,

18
0:01:09.507,000 --> 0:01:13,000
there had been shelling with half-ton missiles,

19
0:01:13.65,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but this time, the shock --

20
0:01:16.728,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I felt it inside of me,

21
0:01:19.249,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and I thought, "It's very close.

22
0:01:21.274,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It's very, very close."

23
0:01:23.296,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So I went down to see what was happening.

24
0:01:25.7,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I went down to the 15th floor

25
0:01:29.671,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to take a look.

26
0:01:31.043,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And I saw people, journalists, screaming in the hallways.

27
0:01:34.67,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I walked into a room

28
0:01:36.925,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and realized that it had been hit by a missile.

29
0:01:42.169,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Someone had been wounded.

30
0:01:45.304,000 --> 0:01:47,000
There was a man near the window,

31
0:01:47.396,000 --> 0:01:5,000
a cameraman named Taras Protsyuk,

32
0:01:52.245,000 --> 0:01:54,000
lying face-down.

33
0:01:58.796,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Having worked in a hospital before, I wanted to help out.

34
0:02:02.996,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So I turned him over.

35
0:02:04.521,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And when I turned him over,

36
0:02:08.334,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I noticed that he was open from sternum to pubis,

37
0:02:11.509,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but I couldn't see anything, nothing at all.

38
0:02:14.467,000 --> 0:02:2,000
All I saw was a white, pearly, shiny spot that blinded me,

39
0:02:21.245,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and I didn't understand what was going on.

40
0:02:23.879,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Once the spot disappeared and I could see his wound,

41
0:02:26.555,000 --> 0:02:27,000
which was very serious,

42
0:02:28.156,000 --> 0:02:3,000
my buddies and I put a sheet underneath him,

43
0:02:30.275,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and we carried him onto an elevator that stopped at each of the 15 floors.

44
0:02:34.616,000 --> 0:02:36,000
We put him in a car that took him to the hospital.

45
0:02:36.984,000 --> 0:02:37,000
He died on the way to the hospital.

46
0:02:38.77,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The Spanish cameraman José Couso, who was on the 14th floor and also hit --

47
0:02:43.784,000 --> 0:02:46,000
because the shell had exploded between the two floors --

48
0:02:47.118,000 --> 0:02:48,000
died on the operating table.

49
0:02:49.078,000 --> 0:02:51,000
As soon as the car left, I went back.

50
0:02:51.499,000 --> 0:02:53,000
There was that article I was supposed to write --

51
0:02:53.856,000 --> 0:02:54,000
which I had to write.

52
0:02:56.117,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And so --

53
0:02:57.87,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I returned to the hotel lobby with my arms covered in blood,

54
0:03:04.792,000 --> 0:03:06,000
when one of the hotel gofers stopped me

55
0:03:07.356,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and asked me to pay the tax I hadn't paid for 10 days.

56
0:03:11.227,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I told him to get lost.

57
0:03:13.059,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And I said to myself: "Clear your head, put it all aside.

58
0:03:19.097,000 --> 0:03:21,000
If you want to write, you need to put it all aside."

59
0:03:21.57,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And that's what I did.

60
0:03:22.809,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I went upstairs, wrote my article and sent it off.

61
0:03:27.077,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Later, aside from the feeling of having lost my colleagues,

62
0:03:31.895,000 --> 0:03:33,000
something else was bothering me.

63
0:03:34.442,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I kept seeing that shiny, pearly spot,

64
0:03:40.735,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and I couldn't understand what it meant.

65
0:03:43.731,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And then, the war was over.

66
0:03:48.572,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Later, I thought: "That's not possible. I can't just not know what happened."

67
0:03:54.692,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Because it wasn't the first time, and it didn't only happen to me.

68
0:03:58.177,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I have seen things like that happen to others

69
0:04:02.106,000 --> 0:04:04,000
in my 20 to 35 years of reporting.

70
0:04:04.798,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I have seen things that had an effect on me too.

71
0:04:08.108,000 --> 0:04:11,000
For example, there was this man I knew in Lebanon,

72
0:04:11.177,000 --> 0:04:13,000
a 25-year-old veteran who had been fighting for five years --

73
0:04:14.107,000 --> 0:04:16,000
a real veteran -- who we would follow everywhere.

74
0:04:16.474,000 --> 0:04:19,000
He would crawl in the dark with confidence --

75
0:04:20.731,000 --> 0:04:22,000
he was a great soldier, a true soldier --

76
0:04:23.167,000 --> 0:04:26,000
so we would follow him, knowing that we would be safe with him.

77
0:04:26.548,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And one day, as I was told --

78
0:04:28.88,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and I've seen him again since --

79
0:04:30.5,000 --> 0:04:32,000
he was back in the camp, playing cards,

80
0:04:32.865,000 --> 0:04:33,000
when someone came in next door,

81
0:04:36.158,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and discharged their weapon.

82
0:04:38.318,000 --> 0:04:39,000
As the gun went off,

83
0:04:39.85,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that blast, that one shot, made him duck quickly under the table,

84
0:04:46.204,000 --> 0:04:47,000
like a child.

85
0:04:47.442,000 --> 0:04:48,000
He was shaking, panicking.

86
0:04:49.357,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And since then, he has never been able to get up and fight.

87
0:04:54.189,000 --> 0:04:56,000
He ended up working as a croupier

88
0:04:56.905,000 --> 0:04:58,000
in a Beirut casino where I later found him,

89
0:04:59.051,000 --> 0:05:01,000
because he couldn't sleep, so it was quite a suitable job.

90
0:05:02.378,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So I thought to myself,

91
0:05:04.957,000 --> 0:05:06,000
"What is this thing that can kill you

92
0:05:08.035,000 --> 0:05:12,000
without leaving any visible scars?

93
0:05:12.974,000 --> 0:05:13,000
How does that happen?

94
0:05:16.04,000 --> 0:05:18,000
What is this unknown thing?"

95
0:05:19.206,000 --> 0:05:23,000
It was too common to be coincidental.

96
0:05:23.597,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So I started to investigate --

97
0:05:25.279,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that's all I know how to do.

98
0:05:27.297,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I started to investigate

99
0:05:29.164,000 --> 0:05:31,000
by looking through books,

100
0:05:32.836,000 --> 0:05:34,000
reaching out to psychiatrists,

101
0:05:35.202,000 --> 0:05:37,000
going to museums, libraries, etc.

102
0:05:38.224,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Finally, I discovered that some people knew about this --

103
0:05:42.95,000 --> 0:05:43,000
often military psychiatrists --

104
0:05:44.904,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and that what we were dealing with was called trauma.

105
0:05:49.817,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Americans call it PTSD or traumatic neurosis.

106
0:05:54.667,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It was something

107
0:05:58.262,000 --> 0:05:59,000
that existed,

108
0:06:00.206,000 --> 0:06:02,000
but that we never spoke about.

109
0:06:04.206,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So, this trauma --

110
0:06:06.452,000 --> 0:06:07,000
what is it?

111
0:06:07.633,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Well, it's an encounter with death.

112
0:06:11.126,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I don't know if you've ever had an experience with death --

113
0:06:13.952,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I'm not talking about dead bodies,

114
0:06:15.859,000 --> 0:06:18,000
or someone's grandfather lying in a hospital bed,

115
0:06:19.484,000 --> 0:06:22,000
or someone who got hit by a car.

116
0:06:24.134,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I'm talking about facing the void of death.

117
0:06:29.688,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And that is something no one is supposed to see.

118
0:06:35.885,000 --> 0:06:36,000
People used to say,

119
0:06:37.751,000 --> 0:06:4,000
"Neither the sun, nor death can be looked at with a steady eye."

120
0:06:41.75,000 --> 0:06:45,000
A human being should not have to face the void of death.

121
0:06:46.008,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But when that happens,

122
0:06:49.801,000 --> 0:06:52,000
it can remain invisible for a while --

123
0:06:53.573,000 --> 0:06:55,000
days, weeks, months, sometimes years.

124
0:06:56.365,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And then, at some point,

125
0:06:59.587,000 --> 0:07:,000
it explodes,

126
0:07:00.897,000 --> 0:07:03,000
because it's something that has entered your brain --

127
0:07:04.665,000 --> 0:07:08,000
a sort of window between an image and your mind --

128
0:07:09.34,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that has penetrated your brain,

129
0:07:11.689,000 --> 0:07:15,000
staying there and taking up all the space inside.

130
0:07:17.541,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And there are people -- men, women,

131
0:07:20.858,000 --> 0:07:22,000
who suddenly no longer sleep.

132
0:07:24.376,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And they experience horrible anxiety attacks --

133
0:07:26.745,000 --> 0:07:29,000
panic attacks, not just minor fears.

134
0:07:29.799,000 --> 0:07:31,000
They suddenly don't want to sleep,

135
0:07:32.129,000 --> 0:07:36,000
because when they do, they have the same nightmare every night.

136
0:07:36.687,000 --> 0:07:37,000
They see the same image every night.

137
0:07:38.631,000 --> 0:07:39,000
What type of image?

138
0:07:40.282,000 --> 0:07:42,000
For example, a soldier who enters a building

139
0:07:43.109,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and comes face to face with another soldier aiming at him.

140
0:07:45.967,000 --> 0:07:47,000
He looks at the gun, straight down the barrel.

141
0:07:48.554,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And this barrel suddenly becomes enormous, deformed.

142
0:07:52.162,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It becomes fluffy, swallowing everything.

143
0:07:54.94,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And he says --

144
0:07:58.376,000 --> 0:08:,000
later he will say, "I saw death.

145
0:08:00.742,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I saw myself dead, therefore I'm dead."

146
0:08:03.267,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And from then on, he knows he is dead.

147
0:08:07.148,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It is not a perception -- he is convinced that he is dead.

148
0:08:12.057,000 --> 0:08:15,000
In reality, someone came in, the guy left or didn't shoot, whatever,

149
0:08:15.613,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and he didn't actually get shot --

150
0:08:17.284,000 --> 0:08:18,000
but to him, he died in that moment.

151
0:08:19.016,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Or it can be the smell of a mass grave --

152
0:08:21.147,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I saw a lot of that in Rwanda.

153
0:08:23.51,000 --> 0:08:25,000
It can be the voice of a friend calling,

154
0:08:27.113,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and they're being slaughtered and there's nothing you can do.

155
0:08:30.897,000 --> 0:08:31,000
You hear that voice,

156
0:08:32.127,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and you wake up every night -- for weeks, months --

157
0:08:37.657,000 --> 0:08:39,000
in a trance-like state, anxious and terrified,

158
0:08:40.438,000 --> 0:08:41,000
like a child.

159
0:08:41.817,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I have seen men cry --

160
0:08:44.652,000 --> 0:08:45,000
just like children --

161
0:08:46.442,000 --> 0:08:47,000
from seeing the same image.

162
0:08:48.162,000 --> 0:08:52,000
So having that image of horror in your brain,

163
0:08:54.659,000 --> 0:08:55,000
seeing the void of death --

164
0:08:56.521,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that analogue of horror which is hiding something --

165
0:09:00.25,000 --> 0:09:01,000
will completely take over.

166
0:09:01.528,000 --> 0:09:03,000
You cannot do anything, anything at all.

167
0:09:03.859,000 --> 0:09:04,000
You cannot work anymore,

168
0:09:05.177,000 --> 0:09:06,000
you cannot love anymore.

169
0:09:06.484,000 --> 0:09:07,000
You go home and don't recognize anyone.

170
0:09:08.435,000 --> 0:09:1,000
You don't even recognize yourself.

171
0:09:13.181,000 --> 0:09:16,000
You hide and don't leave the house, you lock yourself in, you become ill.

172
0:09:16.729,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I know people who placed small cans outside their house with coins inside,

173
0:09:21.167,000 --> 0:09:22,000
in case someone tried to get in.

174
0:09:23.057,000 --> 0:09:25,000
All of a sudden, you feel like you want to die or kill

175
0:09:25.953,000 --> 0:09:26,000
or hide or run away.

176
0:09:27.525,000 --> 0:09:29,000
You want to be loved, but you hate everyone.

177
0:09:29.7,000 --> 0:09:32,000
It's a feeling that seizes you entirely

178
0:09:34.644,000 --> 0:09:35,000
day in and day out,

179
0:09:36.399,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and you suffer tremendously.

180
0:09:41.351,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And no one understands.

181
0:09:42.852,000 --> 0:09:45,000
They say, "There's nothing wrong with you. You seem fine, you have no injuries.

182
0:09:46.644,000 --> 0:09:48,000
You went to war, came back; you're fine."

183
0:09:50.231,000 --> 0:09:51,000
These people suffer tremendously.

184
0:09:52.137,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Some commit suicide.

185
0:09:54.035,000 --> 0:09:56,000
After all, suicide is like updating your daily planner --

186
0:09:56.773,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I'm already dead, I might as well commit suicide.

187
0:09:59.108,000 --> 0:10:,000
Plus, there is no more pain.

188
0:10:01.067,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Some commit suicide, others end up under the bridge, drinking.

189
0:10:05.121,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Everyone remembers that grandfather or uncle or neighbor

190
0:10:09.517,000 --> 0:10:1,000
who used to drink, never said a word,

191
0:10:11.511,000 --> 0:10:12,000
always in a bad mood, beat his wife

192
0:10:13.304,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and who would end up either sinking into alcoholism or dying.

193
0:10:17.457,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And why do we not talk about this?

194
0:10:20.261,000 --> 0:10:23,000
We don't talk about it because it's taboo.

195
0:10:24.157,000 --> 0:10:27,000
It's not like we don't have the words to express the void of death.

196
0:10:27.948,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But others don't want hear it.

197
0:10:29.74,000 --> 0:10:31,000
The first time I returned from an assignment,

198
0:10:31.878,000 --> 0:10:32,000
They said, "Oh! He's back."

199
0:10:33.428,000 --> 0:10:36,000
There was a fancy dinner -- white tablecloth, candles, guests.

200
0:10:36.548,000 --> 0:10:37,000
"Tell us everything!"

201
0:10:37.764,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Which I did.

202
0:10:40.075,000 --> 0:10:42,000
After 20 minutes, people were giving me dirty looks,

203
0:10:42.583,000 --> 0:10:44,000
the hostess had her nose in the ashtray.

204
0:10:44.612,000 --> 0:10:46,000
It was horrible and I realized I ruined the whole evening.

205
0:10:47.607,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So I don't talk about it anymore.

206
0:10:49.54,000 --> 0:10:5,000
We're just not ready to listen.

207
0:10:51.105,000 --> 0:10:52,000
People say outright: "Please, stop."

208
0:10:52.857,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Is that a rare occurrence?

209
0:10:54.978,000 --> 0:10:56,000
No, it's extremely common.

210
0:10:57.404,000 --> 0:10:59,000
One third of the soldiers who died in Iraq --

211
0:10:59.581,000 --> 0:11:01,000
well, not "died," let me re-phrase that --

212
0:11:02.127,000 --> 0:11:05,000
one third of the US soldiers who went to Iraq

213
0:11:05.291,000 --> 0:11:06,000
suffer from PTSD.

214
0:11:06.953,000 --> 0:11:11,000
In 1939, there were still 200,000 soldiers from the First World War

215
0:11:12.898,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that were being treated in British psychiatric hospitals.

216
0:11:17.066,000 --> 0:11:19,000
In Vietnam, 54,000 people died --

217
0:11:19.524,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Americans.

218
0:11:20.891,000 --> 0:11:24,000
In 1987, the US government identified 102,000 --

219
0:11:25.088,000 --> 0:11:26,000
twice as many --

220
0:11:26.326,000 --> 0:11:28,000
102,000 veterans who died from committing suicide.

221
0:11:28.974,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Twice as many deaths by suicide than by combat in Vietnam.

222
0:11:31.814,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So you see, this relates to everything,

223
0:11:34.996,000 --> 0:11:36,000
not just modern warfare, but also ancient wars --

224
0:11:37.359,000 --> 0:11:39,000
you can read about it, the evidence is there.

225
0:11:40.382,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So why do we not talk about it?

226
0:11:42.651,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Why have we not talked about it?

227
0:11:45.12,000 --> 0:11:49,000
The problem is that if you don't talk about it,

228
0:11:50.642,000 --> 0:11:51,000
you're heading for disaster.

229
0:11:53.528,000 --> 0:11:55,000
The only way to heal --

230
0:11:56.367,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and the good news here is that this is treatable --

231
0:12:00.829,000 --> 0:12:02,000
think Munch's The Scream, Goya, etc. --

232
0:12:02.924,000 --> 0:12:03,000
it's indeed treatable.

233
0:12:04.233,000 --> 0:12:08,000
The only way to heal from this trauma,

234
0:12:08.817,000 --> 0:12:13,000
from this encounter with death that overwhelms, petrifies and kills you

235
0:12:13.897,000 --> 0:12:17,000
is to find a way to express it.

236
0:12:18.54,000 --> 0:12:19,000
People used to say,

237
0:12:20.303,000 --> 0:12:23,000
"Language is the only thing that holds all of us together."

238
0:12:23.894,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Without language, we're nothing.

239
0:12:26.259,000 --> 0:12:28,000
It's the thing that makes us human.

240
0:12:28.9,000 --> 0:12:29,000
In the face of such a horrible image --

241
0:12:30.901,000 --> 0:12:35,000
a wordless image of oblivion that obsesses us --

242
0:12:36.451,000 --> 0:12:38,000
the only way to cope with it

243
0:12:40.109,000 --> 0:12:42,000
is to put human words to it.

244
0:12:42.234,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Because these people feel excluded from humanity.

245
0:12:44.684,000 --> 0:12:47,000
No one wants to see them anymore and they don't want to see anyone.

246
0:12:47.914,000 --> 0:12:49,000
They feel dirty, defiled, ashamed.

247
0:12:50.359,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Someone said, "Doctor, I don't use the subway anymore

248
0:12:53.627,000 --> 0:12:56,000
because I'm afraid people will see the horror in my eyes."

249
0:12:56.865,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Another guy thought he had a terrible skin disease

250
0:12:59.755,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and spent six months with dermatologists, going from doctor to doctor.

251
0:13:03.616,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And then one day, they sent him to a psychiatrist.

252
0:13:06.179,000 --> 0:13:08,000
During his second session, he told the psychiatrist

253
0:13:08.608,000 --> 0:13:1,000
he had a terrible skin disease from head to toe.

254
0:13:10.962,000 --> 0:13:12,000
The psychiatrist asked, "Why are you in this state?"

255
0:13:13.905,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And the man said, "Well, because I'm dead, so I must be rotting away."

256
0:13:17.255,000 --> 0:13:21,000
So you see this is something that has a profound effect on people.

257
0:13:21.692,000 --> 0:13:23,000
In order to heal, we need to talk about it.

258
0:13:24.125,000 --> 0:13:27,000
The horror needs to be put into words --

259
0:13:28.093,000 --> 0:13:32,000
human words, so we can organize it and talk about it again.

260
0:13:32.3,000 --> 0:13:36,000
We have to look death in the face.

261
0:13:37.061,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And if we can do that, if we can talk about these things,

262
0:13:42.18,000 --> 0:13:45,000
then step by step, by working it out verbally,

263
0:13:45.629,000 --> 0:13:47,000
we can reclaim our place in humanity.

264
0:13:49.549,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And it is important.

265
0:13:50.837,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Silence kills us.

266
0:13:53.789,000 --> 0:13:54,000
So what does this mean?

267
0:13:55.235,000 --> 0:13:57,000
It means that after a trauma,

268
0:13:57.275,000 --> 0:14:,000
without question, we lose our "unbearable lightness of being,"

269
0:14:00.934,000 --> 0:14:02,000
that sense of immortality that keeps us here --

270
0:14:03.712,000 --> 0:14:06,000
meaning, if we're here, we almost feel like we're immortal, which we're not,

271
0:14:07.648,000 --> 0:14:1,000
but if we didn't believe that, we'd say, "What's the point of it all?"

272
0:14:11.015,000 --> 0:14:13,000
But trauma survivors have lost that feeling of immortality.

273
0:14:13.829,000 --> 0:14:14,000
They've lost their lightness.

274
0:14:15.248,000 --> 0:14:16,000
But they have found something else.

275
0:14:17.011,000 --> 0:14:2,000
So this means that if we manage to look death in the face,

276
0:14:21.546,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and actually confront it, rather than keep quiet and hide,

277
0:14:26.472,000 --> 0:14:28,000
like some of the men or women I know did,

278
0:14:28.975,000 --> 0:14:34,000
such as Michael from Rwanda, Carole from Iraq, Philippe from the Congo

279
0:14:35.653,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and other people I know,

280
0:14:36.903,000 --> 0:14:38,000
like Sorj Chalandon, now a great writer,

281
0:14:39.025,000 --> 0:14:41,000
who gave up field assignments after a trauma.

282
0:14:41.34,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Five friends of mine committed suicide,

283
0:14:43.582,000 --> 0:14:45,000
they're the ones who did not survive the trauma.

284
0:14:46.182,000 --> 0:14:51,000
So if we can look death in the face,

285
0:14:51.752,000 --> 0:14:53,000
if we, mortal humans, human mortals,

286
0:14:54.554,000 --> 0:14:56,000
understand that we are human and mortal, mortal and human,

287
0:14:57.419,000 --> 0:15:03,000
if we can confront death and identify it once again

288
0:15:03.69,000 --> 0:15:06,000
as the most mysterious place of all mysterious places,

289
0:15:07.57,000 --> 0:15:09,000
since no one has ever seen it --

290
0:15:10.15,000 --> 0:15:12,000
if we can give it back this meaning,

291
0:15:12.837,000 --> 0:15:14,000
yes, we may die,

292
0:15:17.686,000 --> 0:15:18,000
survive

293
0:15:20.011,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and come back to life,

294
0:15:21.462,000 --> 0:15:24,000
but we'll come back stronger than before.

295
0:15:24.579,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Much stronger.

296
0:15:25.913,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Thank you.

297
0:15:27.091,000 --> 0:15:28,000
(Applause)

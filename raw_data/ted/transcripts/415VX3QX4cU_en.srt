1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
On the 30th of May, 1832,

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
a gunshot was heard

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
ringing out across the 13th arrondissement in Paris.

4
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(Gunshot)

5
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
A peasant, who was walking to market that morning,

6
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
ran towards where the gunshot had come from,

7
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor,

8
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
clearly shot by a dueling wound.

9
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The young man's name was Evariste Galois.

10
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
He was a well-known revolutionary in Paris at the time.

11
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Galois was taken to the local hospital

12
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
where he died the next day in the arms of his brother.

13
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And the last words he said to his brother were,

14
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
"Don't cry for me, Alfred.

15
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I need all the courage I can muster

16
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
to die at the age of 20."

17
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It wasn't, in fact, revolutionary politics

18
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
for which Galois was famous.

19
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But a few years earlier, while still at school,

20
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
he'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical

21
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
problems at the time.

22
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And he wrote to the academicians in Paris,

23
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
trying to explain his theory.

24
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But the academicians couldn't understand anything that he wrote.

25
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
This is how he wrote most of his mathematics.

27
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So, the night before that duel, he realized

28
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
this possibly is his last chance

29
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to try and explain his great breakthrough.

30
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So he stayed up the whole night, writing away,

31
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
trying to explain his ideas.

32
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny,

33
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
he left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation.

34
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Maybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics

35
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
was the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed.

36
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But contained inside those documents

37
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
was a new language, a language to understand

38
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
one of the most fundamental concepts

39
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
of science -- namely symmetry.

40
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Now, symmetry is almost nature's language.

41
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It helps us to understand so many

42
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
different bits of the scientific world.

43
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
For example, molecular structure.

44
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
What crystals are possible,

45
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
we can understand through the mathematics of symmetry.

46
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
In microbiology you really don't want to get a symmetrical object,

47
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
because they are generally rather nasty.

48
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
The swine flu virus, at the moment, is a symmetrical object.

49
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And it uses the efficiency of symmetry

50
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
to be able to propagate itself so well.

51
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But on a larger scale of biology, actually symmetry is very important,

52
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
because it actually communicates genetic information.

53
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I've taken two pictures here and I've made them artificially symmetrical.

54
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And if I ask you which of these you find more beautiful,

55
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
you're probably drawn to the lower two.

56
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Because it is hard to make symmetry.

57
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And if you can make yourself symmetrical, you're sending out a sign

58
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that you've got good genes, you've got a good upbringing

59
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and therefore you'll make a good mate.

60
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So symmetry is a language which can help to communicate

61
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
genetic information.

62
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Symmetry can also help us to explain

63
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
what's happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.

64
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Or what's not happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.

65
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
To be able to make predictions about the fundamental particles

66
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
we might see there,

67
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
it seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape

68
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in a higher dimensional space.

69
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And I think Galileo summed up, very nicely,

70
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
the power of mathematics

71
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
to understand the scientific world around us.

72
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
He wrote, "The universe cannot be read

73
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
until we have learnt the language

74
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and become familiar with the characters in which it is written.

75
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
It is written in mathematical language,

76
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometric figures,

77
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
without which means it is humanly impossible

78
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to comprehend a single word."

79
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But it's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry.

80
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Artists too love to play around with symmetry.

81
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
They also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it.

82
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Here is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in "The Magic Mountain."

83
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
He has a character describing the snowflake,

84
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and he says he "shuddered at its perfect precision,

85
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
found it deathly, the very marrow of death."

86
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But what artists like to do is to set up expectations

87
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
of symmetry and then break them.

88
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And a beautiful example of this

89
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I found, actually, when I visited a colleague of mine

90
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
in Japan, Professor Kurokawa.

91
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And he took me up to the temples in Nikko.

92
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs.

93
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And the gateway you see behind

94
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
has eight columns, with beautiful symmetrical designs on them.

95
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Seven of them are exactly the same,

96
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and the eighth one is turned upside down.

97
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And I said to Professor Kurokawa,

98
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
"Wow, the architects must have really been kicking themselves

99
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
when they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down."

100
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And he said, "No, no, no. It was a very deliberate act."

101
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And he referred me to this lovely quote from the Japanese

102
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
"Essays in Idleness" from the 14th century,

103
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
in which the essayist wrote, "In everything,

104
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
uniformity is undesirable.

105
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting,

106
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth."

107
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Even when building the Imperial Palace,

108
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
they always leave one place unfinished.

109
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But if I had to choose one building in the world

110
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to be cast out on a desert island, to live the rest of my life,

111
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
being an addict of symmetry, I would probably choose the Alhambra in Granada.

112
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
This is a palace celebrating symmetry.

113
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Recently I took my family --

114
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips, which my family love.

115
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
This is my son Tamer. You can see

116
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
he's really enjoying our mathematical trip to the Alhambra.

117
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But I wanted to try and enrich him.

118
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I think one of the problems about school mathematics

119
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
is it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded

120
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
in the world we live in.

121
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So, I wanted to open his eyes up to

122
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
how much symmetry is running through the Alhambra.

123
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
You see it already. Immediately you go in,

124
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
the reflective symmetry in the water.

125
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But it's on the walls where all the exciting things are happening.

126
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The Moorish artists were denied the possibility

127
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to draw things with souls.

128
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So they explored a more geometric art.

129
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And so what is symmetry?

130
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
The Alhambra somehow asks all of these questions.

131
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
What is symmetry? When [there] are two of these walls,

132
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
do they have the same symmetries?

133
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Can we say whether they discovered

134
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
all of the symmetries in the Alhambra?

135
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And it was Galois who produced a language

136
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to be able to answer some of these questions.

137
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
For Galois, symmetry -- unlike for Thomas Mann,

138
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
which was something still and deathly --

139
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
for Galois, symmetry was all about motion.

140
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
What can you do to a symmetrical object,

141
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
move it in some way, so it looks the same

142
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
as before you moved it?

143
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I like to describe it as the magic trick moves.

144
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
What can you do to something? You close your eyes.

145
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I do something, put it back down again.

146
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
It looks like it did before it started.

147
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So, for example, the walls in the Alhambra --

148
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I can take all of these tiles, and fix them at the yellow place,

149
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
rotate them by 90 degrees,

150
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
put them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there.

151
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And if you open your eyes again, you wouldn't know that they'd moved.

152
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But it's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry

153
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
inside the Alhambra.

154
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But it's also about producing a language to describe this.

155
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And the power of mathematics is often

156
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to change one thing into another, to change geometry into language.

157
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So I'm going to take you through, perhaps push you a little bit mathematically --

158
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
so brace yourselves --

159
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
push you a little bit to understand how this language works,

160
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
which enables us to capture what is symmetry.

161
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So, let's take these two symmetrical objects here.

162
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Let's take the twisted six-pointed starfish.

163
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
What can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same?

164
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Well, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn,

165
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and still it looks like it did before I started.

166
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I could rotate it by a third of a turn,

167
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
or a half a turn,

168
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
or put it back down on its image, or two thirds of a turn.

169
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And a fifth symmetry, I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn.

170
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object

171
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that make it look like it did before I started.

172
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Now, for Galois, there was actually a sixth symmetry.

173
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Can anybody think what else I could do to this

174
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
which would leave it like I did before I started?

175
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I can't flip it because I've put a little twist on it, haven't I?

176
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It's got no reflective symmetry.

177
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But what I could do is just leave it where it is,

178
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
pick it up, and put it down again.

179
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And for Galois this was like the zeroth symmetry.

180
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Actually, the invention of the number zero

181
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
was a very modern concept, seventh century A.D., by the Indians.

182
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
It seems mad to talk about nothing.

183
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And this is the same idea. This is a symmetrical --

184
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
so everything has symmetry, where you just leave it where it is.

185
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So, this object has six symmetries.

186
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And what about the triangle?

187
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Well, I can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise

188
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
or a third of a turn anticlockwise.

189
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But now this has some reflectional symmetry.

190
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I can reflect it in the line through X,

191
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
or the line through Y,

192
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
or the line through Z.

193
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Five symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry

194
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
where I just pick it up and leave it where it is.

195
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So both of these objects have six symmetries.

196
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Now, I'm a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport,

197
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and you have to do some mathematics

198
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
in order to really understand it.

199
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So here is a little question for you.

200
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And I'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk

201
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
for the person who gets closest to the answer.

202
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
The Rubik's Cube.

203
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?

204
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
How many things can I do to this object

205
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and put it down so it still looks like a cube?

206
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Okay? So I want you to think about that problem as we go on,

207
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and count how many symmetries there are.

208
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end.

209
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
But let's go back down to symmetries that I got for these two objects.

210
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
What Galois realized: it isn't just the individual symmetries,

211
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
but how they interact with each other

212
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
which really characterizes the symmetry of an object.

213
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
If I do one magic trick move followed by another,

214
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
the combination is a third magic trick move.

215
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And here we see Galois starting to develop

216
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
a language to see the substance

217
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
of the things unseen, the sort of abstract idea

218
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
of the symmetry underlying this physical object.

219
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
For example, what if I turn the starfish

220
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
by a sixth of a turn,

221
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and then a third of a turn?

222
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So I've given names. The capital letters, A, B, C, D, E, F,

223
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
are the names for the rotations.

224
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
B, for example, rotates the little yellow dot

225
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
to the B on the starfish. And so on.

226
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So what if I do B, which is a sixth of a turn,

227
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
followed by C, which is a third of a turn?

228
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Well let's do that. A sixth of a turn,

229
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
followed by a third of a turn,

230
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
the combined effect is as if I had just rotated it by half a turn in one go.

231
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
So the little table here records

232
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
how the algebra of these symmetries work.

233
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I do one followed by another, the answer is

234
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
it's rotation D, half a turn.

235
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
What I if I did it in the other order? Would it make any difference?

236
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Let's see. Let's do the third of the turn first, and then the sixth of a turn.

237
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Of course, it doesn't make any difference.

238
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
It still ends up at half a turn.

239
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other.

240
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle.

241
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Let's see what happens if we do two symmetries

242
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
with the triangle, one after the other.

243
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Let's do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise,

244
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and reflect in the line through X.

245
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Well, the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z

246
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to start with.

247
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Now, let's do it in a different order.

248
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Let's do the reflection in X first,

249
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise.

250
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
The combined effect, the triangle ends up somewhere completely different.

251
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
It's as if it was reflected in the line through Y.

252
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Now it matters what order you do the operations in.

253
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And this enables us to distinguish

254
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
why the symmetries of these objects --

255
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
they both have six symmetries. So why shouldn't we say

256
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
they have the same symmetries?

257
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
But the way the symmetries interact

258
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
enable us -- we've now got a language

259
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
to distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different.

260
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And you can try this when you go down to the pub, later on.

261
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn,

262
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
then flip it. And then do it in the other order,

263
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction.

264
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Now, Galois produced some laws for how these tables -- how symmetries interact.

265
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
It's almost like little Sudoku tables.

266
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
You don't see any symmetry twice

267
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
in any row or column.

268
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And, using those rules, he was able to say

269
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that there are in fact only two objects

270
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
with six symmetries.

271
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And they'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle,

272
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
or the symmetries of the six-pointed starfish.

273
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
I think this is an amazing development.

274
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
It's almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry.

275
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
In the front here, I've got one, two, three people

276
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
sitting on one, two, three chairs.

277
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
The people and the chairs are very different,

278
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
but the number, the abstract idea of the number, is the same.

279
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And we can see this now: we go back to the walls in the Alhambra.

280
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Here are two very different walls,

281
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
very different geometric pictures.

282
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
But, using the language of Galois,

283
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things

284
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
are actually the same.

285
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
For example, let's take this beautiful wall

286
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
with the triangles with a little twist on them.

287
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
You can rotate them by a sixth of a turn

288
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
if you ignore the colors. We're not matching up the colors.

289
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
But the shapes match up if I rotate by a sixth of a turn

290
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
around the point where all the triangles meet.

291
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
What about the center of a triangle? I can rotate

292
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
by a third of a turn around the center of the triangle,

293
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and everything matches up.

294
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge,

295
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
where I can rotate by 180 degrees.

296
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And all the tiles match up again.

297
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
So rotate along halfway along the edge, and they all match up.

298
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Now, let's move to the very different-looking wall in the Alhambra.

299
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And we find the same symmetries here, and the same interaction.

300
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So, there was a sixth of a turn. A third of a turn where the Z pieces meet.

301
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars.

302
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And although these walls look very different,

303
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Galois has produced a language to say

304
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same.

305
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And it's a symmetry we call 6-3-2.

306
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Here is another example in the Alhambra.

307
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
This is a wall, a ceiling, and a floor.

308
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
They all look very different. But this language allows us to say

309
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object,

310
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
which we call 4-4-2. Nothing to do with football,

311
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate

312
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
by a quarter of a turn, and one by half a turn.

313
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Now, this power of the language is even more,

314
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
because Galois can say,

315
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
"Did the Moorish artists discover all of the possible symmetries

316
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
on the walls in the Alhambra?"

317
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And it turns out they almost did.

318
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
You can prove, using Galois' language,

319
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
there are actually only 17

320
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
different symmetries that you can do in the walls in the Alhambra.

321
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And they, if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one,

322
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these 17.

323
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
But these are things that we can see.

324
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And the power of Galois' mathematical language

325
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
is it also allows us to create

326
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
symmetrical objects in the unseen world,

327
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
beyond the two-dimensional, three-dimensional,

328
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
all the way through to the four- or five- or infinite-dimensional space.

329
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And that's where I work. I create

330
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
mathematical objects, symmetrical objects,

331
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
using Galois' language,

332
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
in very high dimensional spaces.

333
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
So I think it's a great example of things unseen,

334
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
which the power of mathematical language allows you to create.

335
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So, like Galois, I stayed up all last night

336
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
creating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you,

337
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and I've got a picture of it here.

338
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Well, unfortunately it isn't really a picture. If I could have my board

339
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
at the side here, great, excellent.

340
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Here we are. Unfortunately, I can't show you

341
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
a picture of this symmetrical object.

342
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
But here is the language which describes

343
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
how the symmetries interact.

344
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Now, this new symmetrical object

345
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
does not have a name yet.

346
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Now, people like getting their names on things,

347
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
on craters on the moon

348
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
or new species of animals.

349
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
So I'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object

350
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:2,000
which hasn't been named before.

351
0:15:20.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And this thing -- species die away,

352
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode --

353
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
but this mathematical object will live forever.

354
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
It will make you immortal.

355
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
In order to win this symmetrical object,

356
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
what you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning.

357
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?

358
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Okay, I'm going to sort you out.

359
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Rather than you all shouting out, I want you to count how many digits there are

360
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
in that number. Okay?

361
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
If you've got it as a factorial, you've got to expand the factorials.

362
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Okay, now if you want to play,

363
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:53,000
I want you to stand up, okay?

364
0:15:53.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
If you think you've got an estimate for how many digits,

365
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
right -- we've already got one competitor here.

366
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:,000
If you all stay down he wins it automatically.

367
0:16:00.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Okay. Excellent. So we've got four here, five, six.

368
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Great. Excellent. That should get us going. All right.

369
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Anybody with five or less digits, you've got to sit down,

370
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
because you've underestimated.

371
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Five or less digits. So, if you're in the tens of thousands you've got to sit down.

372
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
60 digits or more, you've got to sit down.

373
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
You've overestimated.

374
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
20 digits or less, sit down.

375
0:16:26.33,000 --> 0:16:31,000
How many digits are there in your number?

376
0:16:31.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Two? So you should have sat down earlier.

377
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
(Laughter)

378
0:16:34.33,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Let's have the other ones, who sat down during the 20, up again. Okay?

379
0:16:38.33,000 --> 0:16:4,000
If I told you 20 or less, stand up.

380
0:16:40.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Because this one. I think there were a few here.

381
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:45,000
The people who just last sat down.

382
0:16:45.33,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Okay, how many digits do you have in your number?

383
0:16:50.33,000 --> 0:16:53,000
(Laughs)

384
0:16:53.33,000 --> 0:16:55,000
21. Okay good. How many do you have in yours?

385
0:16:55.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
18. So it goes to this lady here.

386
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:17:,000
21 is the closest.

387
0:17:00.33,000 --> 0:17:02,000
It actually has -- the number of symmetries in the Rubik's cube

388
0:17:02.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
has 25 digits.

389
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:06,000
So now I need to name this object.

390
0:17:06.33,000 --> 0:17:08,000
So, what is your name?

391
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
I need your surname. Symmetrical objects generally --

392
0:17:11.33,000 --> 0:17:13,000
spell it for me.

393
0:17:13.33,000 --> 0:17:2,000
G-H-E-Z

394
0:17:20.33,000 --> 0:17:22,000
No, SO2 has already been used, actually,

395
0:17:22.33,000 --> 0:17:24,000
in the mathematical language. So you can't have that one.

396
0:17:24.33,000 --> 0:17:26,000
So Ghez, there we go. That's your new symmetrical object.

397
0:17:26.33,000 --> 0:17:28,000
You are now immortal.

398
0:17:28.33,000 --> 0:17:34,000
(Applause)

399
0:17:34.33,000 --> 0:17:36,000
And if you'd like your own symmetrical object,

400
0:17:36.33,000 --> 0:17:39,000
I have a project raising money for a charity in Guatemala,

401
0:17:39.33,000 --> 0:17:42,000
where I will stay up all night and devise an object for you,

402
0:17:42.33,000 --> 0:17:46,000
for a donation to this charity to help kids get into education in Guatemala.

403
0:17:46.33,000 --> 0:17:49,000
And I think what drives me, as a mathematician,

404
0:17:49.33,000 --> 0:17:53,000
are those things which are not seen, the things that we haven't discovered.

405
0:17:53.33,000 --> 0:17:57,000
It's all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject.

406
0:17:57.33,000 --> 0:18:,000
And I will always come back to this quote from the Japanese "Essays in Idleness":

407
0:18:00.33,000 --> 0:18:03,000
"In everything, uniformity is undesirable.

408
0:18:03.33,000 --> 0:18:06,000
Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting,

409
0:18:06.33,000 --> 0:18:09,000
and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth." Thank you.

410
0:18:09.33,000 --> 0:18:16,000
(Applause)

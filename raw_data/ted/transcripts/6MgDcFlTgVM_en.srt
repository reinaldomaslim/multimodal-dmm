1
0:00:12.746,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Well, I'm an ocean chemist.

2
0:00:14.223,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I look at the chemistry of the ocean today.

3
0:00:16.366,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I look at the chemistry of the ocean in the past.

4
0:00:19.39,000 --> 0:00:21,000
The way I look back in the past

5
0:00:21.478,000 --> 0:00:24,000
is by using the fossilized remains of deepwater corals.

6
0:00:24.653,000 --> 0:00:26,000
You can see an image of one of these corals behind me.

7
0:00:27.319,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It was collected from close to Antarctica, thousands of meters below the sea,

8
0:00:31.769,000 --> 0:00:33,000
so, very different than the kinds of corals

9
0:00:33.881,000 --> 0:00:36,000
you may have been lucky enough to see if you've had a tropical holiday.

10
0:00:37.692,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So I'm hoping that this talk will give you

11
0:00:39.772,000 --> 0:00:4,000
a four-dimensional view of the ocean.

12
0:00:41.589,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Two dimensions, such as this beautiful two-dimensional image

13
0:00:45.486,000 --> 0:00:46,000
of the sea surface temperature.

14
0:00:47.104,000 --> 0:00:51,000
This was taken using satellite, so it's got tremendous spatial resolution.

15
0:00:51.898,000 --> 0:00:53,000
The overall features are extremely easy to understand.

16
0:00:54.788,000 --> 0:00:57,000
The equatorial regions are warm because there's more sunlight.

17
0:00:58.476,000 --> 0:01:,000
The polar regions are cold because there's less sunlight.

18
0:01:01.186,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And that allows big icecaps to build up on Antarctica

19
0:01:04.131,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and up in the Northern Hemisphere.

20
0:01:06.299,000 --> 0:01:09,000
If you plunge deep into the sea, or even put your toes in the sea,

21
0:01:09.741,000 --> 0:01:1,000
you know it gets colder as you go down,

22
0:01:11.708,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and that's mostly because the deep waters that fill the abyss of the ocean

23
0:01:15.711,000 --> 0:01:18,000
come from the cold polar regions where the waters are dense.

24
0:01:19.845,000 --> 0:01:22,000
If we travel back in time 20,000 years ago,

25
0:01:22.975,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the earth looked very much different.

26
0:01:24.859,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And I've just given you a cartoon version of one of the major differences

27
0:01:28.35,000 --> 0:01:3,000
you would have seen if you went back that long.

28
0:01:30.629,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The icecaps were much bigger.

29
0:01:32.335,000 --> 0:01:35,000
They covered lots of the continent, and they extended out over the ocean.

30
0:01:35.986,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Sea level was 120 meters lower.

31
0:01:38.503,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Carbon dioxide [levels] were very much lower than they are today.

32
0:01:42.071,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So the earth was probably about three to five degrees colder overall,

33
0:01:45.739,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and much, much colder in the polar regions.

34
0:01:49.908,000 --> 0:01:5,000
What I'm trying to understand,

35
0:01:51.386,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and what other colleagues of mine are trying to understand,

36
0:01:54.212,000 --> 0:01:56,000
is how we moved from that cold climate condition

37
0:01:56.695,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to the warm climate condition that we enjoy today.

38
0:01:59.615,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We know from ice core research

39
0:02:01.698,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that the transition from these cold conditions to warm conditions

40
0:02:04.802,000 --> 0:02:08,000
wasn't smooth, as you might predict from the slow increase in solar radiation.

41
0:02:10.153,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And we know this from ice cores, because if you drill down into ice,

42
0:02:13.408,000 --> 0:02:16,000
you find annual bands of ice, and you can see this in the iceberg.

43
0:02:16.703,000 --> 0:02:17,000
You can see those blue-white layers.

44
0:02:18.718,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Gases are trapped in the ice cores, so we can measure CO2 --

45
0:02:22.368,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that's why we know CO2 was lower in the past --

46
0:02:24.757,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and the chemistry of the ice also tells us about temperature

47
0:02:27.774,000 --> 0:02:28,000
in the polar regions.

48
0:02:29.273,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And if you move in time from 20,000 years ago to the modern day,

49
0:02:32.976,000 --> 0:02:33,000
you see that temperature increased.

50
0:02:34.809,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It didn't increase smoothly.

51
0:02:36.458,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Sometimes it increased very rapidly,

52
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
then there was a plateau,

53
0:02:39.528,000 --> 0:02:4,000
then it increased rapidly.

54
0:02:40.817,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It was different in the two polar regions,

55
0:02:42.865,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and CO2 also increased in jumps.

56
0:02:46.808,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So we're pretty sure the ocean has a lot to do with this.

57
0:02:49.878,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The ocean stores huge amounts of carbon,

58
0:02:52.268,000 --> 0:02:54,000
about 60 times more than is in the atmosphere.

59
0:02:54.846,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It also acts to transport heat across the equator,

60
0:02:58.072,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and the ocean is full of nutrients and it controls primary productivity.

61
0:03:02.142,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So if we want to find out what's going on down in the deep sea,

62
0:03:05.15,000 --> 0:03:06,000
we really need to get down there,

63
0:03:06.767,000 --> 0:03:07,000
see what's there

64
0:03:07.957,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and start to explore.

65
0:03:09.385,000 --> 0:03:12,000
This is some spectacular footage coming from a seamount

66
0:03:12.416,000 --> 0:03:14,000
about a kilometer deep in international waters

67
0:03:14.629,000 --> 0:03:16,000
in the equatorial Atlantic, far from land.

68
0:03:17.633,000 --> 0:03:2,000
You're amongst the first people to see this bit of the seafloor,

69
0:03:20.706,000 --> 0:03:21,000
along with my research team.

70
0:03:23.34,000 --> 0:03:24,000
You're probably seeing new species.

71
0:03:25.108,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We don't know.

72
0:03:26.284,000 --> 0:03:29,000
You'd have to collect the samples and do some very intense taxonomy.

73
0:03:29.968,000 --> 0:03:3,000
You can see beautiful bubblegum corals.

74
0:03:31.885,000 --> 0:03:33,000
There are brittle stars growing on these corals.

75
0:03:34.163,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Those are things that look like tentacles coming out of corals.

76
0:03:37.243,000 --> 0:03:39,000
There are corals made of different forms of calcium carbonate

77
0:03:40.139,000 --> 0:03:43,000
growing off the basalt of this massive undersea mountain,

78
0:03:43.539,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and the dark sort of stuff, those are fossilized corals,

79
0:03:46.927,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and we're going to talk a little more about those

80
0:03:49.262,000 --> 0:03:5,000
as we travel back in time.

81
0:03:51.03,000 --> 0:03:53,000
To do that, we need to charter a research boat.

82
0:03:53.539,000 --> 0:03:56,000
This is the James Cook, an ocean-class research vessel

83
0:03:56.603,000 --> 0:03:57,000
moored up in Tenerife.

84
0:03:57.897,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Looks beautiful, right?

85
0:03:59.554,000 --> 0:04:,000
Great, if you're not a great mariner.

86
0:04:01.702,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Sometimes it looks a little more like this.

87
0:04:04.23,000 --> 0:04:07,000
This is us trying to make sure that we don't lose precious samples.

88
0:04:07.453,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Everyone's scurrying around, and I get terribly seasick,

89
0:04:10.294,000 --> 0:04:12,000
so it's not always a lot of fun, but overall it is.

90
0:04:13.312,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So we've got to become a really good mapper to do this.

91
0:04:15.922,000 --> 0:04:18,000
You don't see that kind of spectacular coral abundance everywhere.

92
0:04:19.685,000 --> 0:04:22,000
It is global and it is deep,

93
0:04:22.749,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but we need to really find the right places.

94
0:04:25.087,000 --> 0:04:28,000
We just saw a global map, and overlaid was our cruise passage

95
0:04:28.277,000 --> 0:04:29,000
from last year.

96
0:04:29.99,000 --> 0:04:3,000
This was a seven-week cruise,

97
0:04:31.41,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and this is us, having made our own maps

98
0:04:33.458,000 --> 0:04:37,000
of about 75,000 square kilometers of the seafloor in seven weeks,

99
0:04:37.553,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but that's only a tiny fraction of the seafloor.

100
0:04:40.099,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We're traveling from west to east,

101
0:04:41.892,000 --> 0:04:44,000
over part of the ocean that would look featureless on a big-scale map,

102
0:04:45.416,000 --> 0:04:48,000
but actually some of these mountains are as big as Everest.

103
0:04:48.697,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So with the maps that we make on board,

104
0:04:50.65,000 --> 0:04:51,000
we get about 100-meter resolution,

105
0:04:52.666,000 --> 0:04:54,000
enough to pick out areas to deploy our equipment,

106
0:04:55.579,000 --> 0:04:56,000
but not enough to see very much.

107
0:04:57.517,000 --> 0:04:59,000
To do that, we need to fly remotely-operated vehicles

108
0:05:00.263,000 --> 0:05:02,000
about five meters off the seafloor.

109
0:05:02.501,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And if we do that, we can get maps that are one-meter resolution

110
0:05:05.74,000 --> 0:05:07,000
down thousands of meters.

111
0:05:07.858,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Here is a remotely-operated vehicle,

112
0:05:09.699,000 --> 0:05:11,000
a research-grade vehicle.

113
0:05:12.034,000 --> 0:05:14,000
You can see an array of big lights on the top.

114
0:05:14.54,000 --> 0:05:17,000
There are high-definition cameras, manipulator arms,

115
0:05:17.619,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and lots of little boxes and things to put your samples.

116
0:05:21.087,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Here we are on our first dive of this particular cruise,

117
0:05:24.829,000 --> 0:05:25,000
plunging down into the ocean.

118
0:05:26.559,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We go pretty fast to make sure the remotely operated vehicles

119
0:05:29.456,000 --> 0:05:3,000
are not affected by any other ships.

120
0:05:31.203,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And we go down,

121
0:05:32.425,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and these are the kinds of things you see.

122
0:05:34.623,000 --> 0:05:37,000
These are deep sea sponges, meter scale.

123
0:05:38.817,000 --> 0:05:42,000
This is a swimming holothurian -- it's a small sea slug, basically.

124
0:05:43.089,000 --> 0:05:44,000
This is slowed down.

125
0:05:44.3,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Most of the footage I'm showing you is speeded up,

126
0:05:46.713,000 --> 0:05:47,000
because all of this takes a lot of time.

127
0:05:49.474,000 --> 0:05:51,000
This is a beautiful holothurian as well.

128
0:05:52.897,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And this animal you're going to see coming up was a big surprise.

129
0:05:55.993,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I've never seen anything like this and it took us all a bit surprised.

130
0:05:59.429,000 --> 0:06:02,000
This was after about 15 hours of work and we were all a bit trigger-happy,

131
0:06:03.041,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and suddenly this giant sea monster started rolling past.

132
0:06:05.802,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It's called a pyrosome or colonial tunicate, if you like.

133
0:06:08.932,000 --> 0:06:09,000
This wasn't what we were looking for.

134
0:06:10.743,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We were looking for corals, deep sea corals.

135
0:06:14.194,000 --> 0:06:16,000
You're going to see a picture of one in a moment.

136
0:06:16.516,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It's small, about five centimeters high.

137
0:06:19.175,000 --> 0:06:22,000
It's made of calcium carbonate, so you can see its tentacles there,

138
0:06:22.517,000 --> 0:06:24,000
moving in the ocean currents.

139
0:06:25.18,000 --> 0:06:28,000
An organism like this probably lives for about a hundred years.

140
0:06:28.315,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And as it grows, it takes in chemicals from the ocean.

141
0:06:31.879,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And the chemicals, or the amount of chemicals,

142
0:06:34.109,000 --> 0:06:36,000
depends on the temperature; it depends on the pH,

143
0:06:36.807,000 --> 0:06:37,000
it depends on the nutrients.

144
0:06:38.377,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And if we can understand how these chemicals get into the skeleton,

145
0:06:41.635,000 --> 0:06:43,000
we can then go back, collect fossil specimens,

146
0:06:44.157,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and reconstruct what the ocean used to look like in the past.

147
0:06:47.325,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And here you can see us collecting that coral with a vacuum system,

148
0:06:50.785,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and we put it into a sampling container.

149
0:06:53.41,000 --> 0:06:55,000
We can do this very carefully, I should add.

150
0:06:55.493,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Some of these organisms live even longer.

151
0:06:57.902,000 --> 0:07:,000
This is a black coral called Leiopathes, an image taken by my colleague,

152
0:07:01.328,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Brendan Roark, about 500 meters below Hawaii.

153
0:07:04.614,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Four thousand years is a long time.

154
0:07:06.962,000 --> 0:07:09,000
If you take a branch from one of these corals and polish it up,

155
0:07:10.121,000 --> 0:07:12,000
this is about 100 microns across.

156
0:07:12.763,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And Brendan took some analyses across this coral --

157
0:07:15.278,000 --> 0:07:16,000
you can see the marks --

158
0:07:17.108,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and he's been able to show that these are actual annual bands,

159
0:07:20.091,000 --> 0:07:21,000
so even at 500 meters deep in the ocean,

160
0:07:22.028,000 --> 0:07:24,000
corals can record seasonal changes,

161
0:07:24.82,000 --> 0:07:25,000
which is pretty spectacular.

162
0:07:26.576,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But 4,000 years is not enough to get us back to our last glacial maximum.

163
0:07:30.398,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So what do we do?

164
0:07:31.58,000 --> 0:07:33,000
We go in for these fossil specimens.

165
0:07:34.18,000 --> 0:07:36,000
This is what makes me really unpopular with my research team.

166
0:07:37.135,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So going along,

167
0:07:38.309,000 --> 0:07:39,000
there's giant sharks everywhere,

168
0:07:39.951,000 --> 0:07:41,000
there are pyrosomes, there are swimming holothurians,

169
0:07:42.473,000 --> 0:07:43,000
there's giant sponges,

170
0:07:43.768,000 --> 0:07:45,000
but I make everyone go down to these dead fossil areas

171
0:07:46.387,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and spend ages kind of shoveling around on the seafloor.

172
0:07:49.967,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And we pick up all these corals, bring them back, we sort them out.

173
0:07:53.356,000 --> 0:07:55,000
But each one of these is a different age,

174
0:07:55.675,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and if we can find out how old they are

175
0:07:57.6,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and then we can measure those chemical signals,

176
0:08:00.136,000 --> 0:08:01,000
this helps us to find out

177
0:08:01.582,000 --> 0:08:03,000
what's been going on in the ocean in the past.

178
0:08:04.558,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So on the left-hand image here,

179
0:08:06.286,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I've taken a slice through a coral, polished it very carefully

180
0:08:09.342,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and taken an optical image.

181
0:08:11.336,000 --> 0:08:12,000
On the right-hand side,

182
0:08:12.512,000 --> 0:08:15,000
we've taken that same piece of coral, put it in a nuclear reactor,

183
0:08:15.636,000 --> 0:08:16,000
induced fission,

184
0:08:16.812,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and every time there's some decay,

185
0:08:18.467,000 --> 0:08:19,000
you can see that marked out in the coral,

186
0:08:20.473,000 --> 0:08:21,000
so we can see the uranium distribution.

187
0:08:22.386,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Why are we doing this?

188
0:08:23.561,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Uranium is a very poorly regarded element,

189
0:08:25.872,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but I love it.

190
0:08:27.055,000 --> 0:08:3,000
The decay helps us find out about the rates and dates

191
0:08:30.291,000 --> 0:08:31,000
of what's going on in the ocean.

192
0:08:31.854,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And if you remember from the beginning,

193
0:08:33.776,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that's what we want to get at when we're thinking about climate.

194
0:08:36.813,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So we use a laser to analyze uranium

195
0:08:38.588,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and one of its daughter products, thorium, in these corals,

196
0:08:41.397,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and that tells us exactly how old the fossils are.

197
0:08:44.742,000 --> 0:08:46,000
This beautiful animation of the Southern Ocean

198
0:08:46.958,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I'm just going to use illustrate how we're using these corals

199
0:08:50.117,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to get at some of the ancient ocean feedbacks.

200
0:08:54.212,000 --> 0:08:56,000
You can see the density of the surface water

201
0:08:56.662,000 --> 0:08:58,000
in this animation by Ryan Abernathey.

202
0:08:59.481,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It's just one year of data,

203
0:09:01.542,000 --> 0:09:03,000
but you can see how dynamic the Southern Ocean is.

204
0:09:04.5,000 --> 0:09:07,000
The intense mixing, particularly the Drake Passage,

205
0:09:07.931,000 --> 0:09:09,000
which is shown by the box,

206
0:09:10.392,000 --> 0:09:12,000
is really one of the strongest currents in the world

207
0:09:13.028,000 --> 0:09:15,000
coming through here, flowing from west to east.

208
0:09:15.259,000 --> 0:09:16,000
It's very turbulently mixed,

209
0:09:16.632,000 --> 0:09:18,000
because it's moving over those great big undersea mountains,

210
0:09:19.528,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and this allows CO2 and heat to exchange with the atmosphere in and out.

211
0:09:24.033,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And essentially, the oceans are breathing through the Southern Ocean.

212
0:09:28.865,000 --> 0:09:33,000
We've collected corals from back and forth across this Antarctic passage,

213
0:09:34.353,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and we've found quite a surprising thing from my uranium dating:

214
0:09:37.404,000 --> 0:09:39,000
the corals migrated from south to north

215
0:09:39.931,000 --> 0:09:42,000
during this transition from the glacial to the interglacial.

216
0:09:43.084,000 --> 0:09:44,000
We don't really know why,

217
0:09:44.315,000 --> 0:09:46,000
but we think it's something to do with the food source

218
0:09:46.888,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and maybe the oxygen in the water.

219
0:09:49.718,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So here we are.

220
0:09:50.897,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I'm going to illustrate what I think we've found about climate

221
0:09:53.969,000 --> 0:09:54,000
from those corals in the Southern Ocean.

222
0:09:55.953,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We went up and down sea mountains. We collected little fossil corals.

223
0:09:59.252,000 --> 0:10:,000
This is my illustration of that.

224
0:10:00.802,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We think back in the glacial,

225
0:10:02.231,000 --> 0:10:04,000
from the analysis we've made in the corals,

226
0:10:04.278,000 --> 0:10:07,000
that the deep part of the Southern Ocean was very rich in carbon,

227
0:10:07.388,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and there was a low-density layer sitting on top.

228
0:10:10.101,000 --> 0:10:12,000
That stops carbon dioxide coming out of the ocean.

229
0:10:13.752,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We then found corals that are of an intermediate age,

230
0:10:16.368,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and they show us that the ocean mixed partway through that climate transition.

231
0:10:20.972,000 --> 0:10:22,000
That allows carbon to come out of the deep ocean.

232
0:10:24.154,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And then if we analyze corals closer to the modern day,

233
0:10:27.277,000 --> 0:10:29,000
or indeed if we go down there today anyway

234
0:10:29.555,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and measure the chemistry of the corals,

235
0:10:31.785,000 --> 0:10:34,000
we see that we move to a position where carbon can exchange in and out.

236
0:10:35.803,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So this is the way we can use fossil corals

237
0:10:37.901,000 --> 0:10:38,000
to help us learn about the environment.

238
0:10:41.827,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So I want to leave you with this last slide.

239
0:10:43.985,000 --> 0:10:46,000
It's just a still taken out of that first piece of footage that I showed you.

240
0:10:47.932,000 --> 0:10:49,000
This is a spectacular coral garden.

241
0:10:50.068,000 --> 0:10:52,000
We didn't even expect to find things this beautiful.

242
0:10:52.65,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It's thousands of meters deep.

243
0:10:54.558,000 --> 0:10:55,000
There are new species.

244
0:10:56.416,000 --> 0:10:57,000
It's just a beautiful place.

245
0:10:58.339,000 --> 0:10:59,000
There are fossils in amongst,

246
0:10:59.744,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and now I've trained you to appreciate the fossil corals

247
0:11:02.459,000 --> 0:11:03,000
that are down there.

248
0:11:03.698,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So next time you're lucky enough to fly over the ocean

249
0:11:06.588,000 --> 0:11:07,000
or sail over the ocean,

250
0:11:08.021,000 --> 0:11:1,000
just think -- there are massive sea mountains down there

251
0:11:10.712,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that nobody's ever seen before,

252
0:11:12.603,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and there are beautiful corals.

253
0:11:14.244,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Thank you.

254
0:11:15.419,000 --> 0:11:19,000
(Applause)

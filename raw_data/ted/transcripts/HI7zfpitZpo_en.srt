1
0:00:13.111,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Today, I am going to talk about anger.

2
0:00:21.128,000 --> 0:00:23,000
When I was 11,

3
0:00:23.13,000 --> 0:00:26,000
seeing some of my friends leaving the school

4
0:00:26.462,000 --> 0:00:3,000
because their parents could not afford textbooks

5
0:00:30.684,000 --> 0:00:32,000
made me angry.

6
0:00:35.316,000 --> 0:00:37,000
When I was 27,

7
0:00:38.068,000 --> 0:00:43,000
hearing the plight of a desperate slave father

8
0:00:43.28,000 --> 0:00:48,000
whose daughter was about to be sold to a brothel

9
0:00:48.302,000 --> 0:00:5,000
made me angry.

10
0:00:52.423,000 --> 0:00:54,000
At the age of 50,

11
0:00:54.763,000 --> 0:00:58,000
lying on the street, in a pool of blood,

12
0:00:59.586,000 --> 0:01:01,000
along with my own son,

13
0:01:02.532,000 --> 0:01:04,000
made me angry.

14
0:01:07.299,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Dear friends, for centuries we were taught anger is bad.

15
0:01:13.274,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Our parents, teachers, priests --

16
0:01:15.486,000 --> 0:01:2,000
everyone taught us how to control and suppress our anger.

17
0:01:24.241,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But I ask why?

18
0:01:27.596,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Why can't we convert our anger for the larger good of society?

19
0:01:32.513,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Why can't we use our anger

20
0:01:34.109,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to challenge and change the evils of the world?

21
0:01:41.705,000 --> 0:01:43,000
That I tried to do.

22
0:01:46.036,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Friends,

23
0:01:49.367,000 --> 0:01:55,000
most of the brightest ideas came to my mind out of anger.

24
0:01:55.814,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Like when I was 35 and sat in a locked-up, tiny prison.

25
0:02:06.564,000 --> 0:02:08,000
The whole night, I was angry.

26
0:02:09.957,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But it has given birth to a new idea.

27
0:02:13.017,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But I will come to that later on.

28
0:02:16.176,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Let me begin with the story of how I got a name for myself.

29
0:02:25.481,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I had been a big admirer of Mahatma Gandhi since my childhood.

30
0:02:31.032,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Gandhi fought and lead India's freedom movement.

31
0:02:37.261,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But more importantly,

32
0:02:39.299,000 --> 0:02:45,000
he taught us how to treat the most vulnerable sections,

33
0:02:46.034,000 --> 0:02:5,000
the most deprived people, with dignity and respect.

34
0:02:51.595,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And so, when India was celebrating

35
0:02:56.562,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Mahatma Gandhi's birth centenary in 1969 --

36
0:02:59.829,000 --> 0:03:01,000
at that time I was 15 --

37
0:03:02.117,000 --> 0:03:04,000
an idea came to my mind.

38
0:03:05.774,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Why can't we celebrate it differently?

39
0:03:09.244,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I knew, as perhaps many of you might know,

40
0:03:14.672,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that in India, a large number of people are born in the lowest segment of caste.

41
0:03:24.185,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And they are treated as untouchables.

42
0:03:27.324,000 --> 0:03:28,000
These are the people --

43
0:03:28.656,000 --> 0:03:32,000
forget about allowing them to go to the temples,

44
0:03:33.066,000 --> 0:03:4,000
they cannot even go into the houses and shops of high-caste people.

45
0:03:40.25,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So I was very impressed with the leaders of my town

46
0:03:45.564,000 --> 0:03:49,000
who were speaking very highly against the caste system and untouchability

47
0:03:50.102,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and talking of Gandhian ideals.

48
0:03:53.774,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So inspired by that, I thought, let us set an example

49
0:03:56.944,000 --> 0:04:02,000
by inviting these people to eat food cooked and served

50
0:04:03.389,000 --> 0:04:06,000
by the untouchable community.

51
0:04:06.619,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I went to some low-caste, so-called untouchable, people,

52
0:04:13.421,000 --> 0:04:17,000
tried to convince them, but it was unthinkable for them.

53
0:04:17.807,000 --> 0:04:2,000
They told me, "No, no. It's not possible. It never happened."

54
0:04:23.07,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I said, "Look at these leaders,

55
0:04:24.784,000 --> 0:04:26,000
they are so great, they are against untouchability.

56
0:04:27.221,000 --> 0:04:29,000
They will come. If nobody comes, we can set an example."

57
0:04:32.891,000 --> 0:04:37,000
These people thought that I was too naive.

58
0:04:40.161,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Finally, they were convinced.

59
0:04:42.651,000 --> 0:04:47,000
My friends and I took our bicycles and invited political leaders.

60
0:04:49.982,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And I was so thrilled, rather, empowered

61
0:04:53.126,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to see that each one of them agreed to come.

62
0:04:59.192,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I thought, "Great idea. We can set an example.

63
0:05:02.083,000 --> 0:05:05,000
We can bring about change in the society."

64
0:05:07.451,000 --> 0:05:08,000
The day has come.

65
0:05:09.724,000 --> 0:05:14,000
All these untouchables, three women and two men,

66
0:05:15.467,000 --> 0:05:18,000
they agreed to come.

67
0:05:19.436,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I could recall that they had used the best of their clothes.

68
0:05:26.475,000 --> 0:05:28,000
They brought new utensils.

69
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:32,000
They had taken baths hundreds of times

70
0:05:32.339,000 --> 0:05:34,000
because it was unthinkable for them to do.

71
0:05:35.3,000 --> 0:05:37,000
It was the moment of change.

72
0:05:39.254,000 --> 0:05:41,000
They gathered. Food was cooked.

73
0:05:42.402,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It was 7 o'clock.

74
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:47,000
By 8 o'clock, we kept on waiting,

75
0:05:47.876,000 --> 0:05:51,000
because it's not very uncommon that the leaders become late,

76
0:05:52.857,000 --> 0:05:53,000
for an hour or so.

77
0:05:55.239,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So after 8 o'clock, we took our bicycles and went to these leaders' homes,

78
0:06:01.922,000 --> 0:06:03,000
just to remind them.

79
0:06:06.248,000 --> 0:06:1,000
One of the leader's wives told me,

80
0:06:10.945,000 --> 0:06:15,000
"Sorry, he is having some headache, perhaps he cannot come."

81
0:06:15.96,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I went to another leader

82
0:06:18.037,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and his wife told me, "Okay, you go, he will definitely join."

83
0:06:23.357,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So I thought that the dinner will take place,

84
0:06:27.469,000 --> 0:06:31,000
though not at that large a scale.

85
0:06:33.352,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I went back to the venue, which was a newly built Mahatma Gandhi Park.

86
0:06:40.559,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It was 10 o'clock.

87
0:06:43.483,000 --> 0:06:46,000
None of the leaders showed up.

88
0:06:48.132,000 --> 0:06:5,000
That made me angry.

89
0:06:52.275,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I was standing, leaning against Mahatma Gandhi's statue.

90
0:07:01.839,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I was emotionally drained, rather exhausted.

91
0:07:08.89,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Then I sat down where the food was lying.

92
0:07:17.695,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I kept my emotions on hold.

93
0:07:19.785,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But then, when I took the first bite,

94
0:07:24.279,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I broke down in tears.

95
0:07:27.21,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder.

96
0:07:32.149,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And it was the healing, motherly touch of an untouchable woman.

97
0:07:38.047,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And she told me, "Kailash, why are you crying?

98
0:07:43.598,000 --> 0:07:45,000
You have done your bit.

99
0:07:46.011,000 --> 0:07:49,000
You have eaten the food cooked by untouchables,

100
0:07:49.136,000 --> 0:07:51,000
which has never happened in our memory."

101
0:07:53.207,000 --> 0:07:57,000
She said, "You won today."

102
0:07:57.789,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And my friends, she was right.

103
0:08:04.059,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I came back home, a little after midnight,

104
0:08:07.789,000 --> 0:08:11,000
shocked to see that several high-caste elderly people

105
0:08:12.363,000 --> 0:08:14,000
were sitting in my courtyard.

106
0:08:14.517,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I saw my mother and elderly women were crying

107
0:08:17.613,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and they were pleading to these elderly people

108
0:08:22.071,000 --> 0:08:24,000
because they had threatened to outcaste my whole family.

109
0:08:26.345,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And you know, outcasting the family is the biggest social punishment

110
0:08:31.477,000 --> 0:08:33,000
one can think of.

111
0:08:35.981,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Somehow they agreed to punish only me, and the punishment was purification.

112
0:08:40.821,000 --> 0:08:44,000
That means I had to go 600 miles away from my hometown

113
0:08:45.336,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to the River Ganges to take a holy dip.

114
0:08:49.267,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And after that, I should organize a feast for priests, 101 priests,

115
0:08:53.691,000 --> 0:08:56,000
wash their feet and drink that water.

116
0:08:58.529,000 --> 0:09:,000
It was total nonsense,

117
0:09:01.528,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and I refused to accept that punishment.

118
0:09:05.267,000 --> 0:09:07,000
How did they punish me?

119
0:09:07.397,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I was barred from entering into my own kitchen and my own dining room,

120
0:09:13.194,000 --> 0:09:16,000
my utensils were separated.

121
0:09:16.246,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But the night when I was angry, they wanted to outcaste me.

122
0:09:22.6,000 --> 0:09:26,000
But I decided to outcaste the entire caste system.

123
0:09:27.503,000 --> 0:09:31,000
(Applause)

124
0:09:32.988,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And that was possible because the beginning would have been

125
0:09:38.003,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to change the family name, or surname,

126
0:09:40.119,000 --> 0:09:43,000
because in India, most of the family names are caste names.

127
0:09:43.784,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So I decided to drop my name.

128
0:09:46.306,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And then, later on, I gave a new name to myself: Satyarthi,

129
0:09:52.81,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that means, "seeker of truth."

130
0:09:57.216,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Applause)

131
0:10:01.248,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And that was the beginning of my transformative anger.

132
0:10:06.095,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Friends, maybe one of you can tell me,

133
0:10:08.704,000 --> 0:10:12,000
what was I doing before becoming a children's rights activist?

134
0:10:14.41,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Does anybody know?

135
0:10:16.898,000 --> 0:10:17,000
No.

136
0:10:18.169,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I was an engineer, an electrical engineer.

137
0:10:24.558,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And then I learned how the energy

138
0:10:29.662,000 --> 0:10:33,000
of burning fire, coal,

139
0:10:34.146,000 --> 0:10:38,000
the nuclear blast inside the chambers,

140
0:10:38.25,000 --> 0:10:41,000
raging river currents,

141
0:10:41.442,000 --> 0:10:44,000
fierce winds,

142
0:10:45.066,000 --> 0:10:5,000
could be converted into the light and lives of millions.

143
0:10:50.963,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I also learned how the most uncontrollable form of energy

144
0:10:55.495,000 --> 0:10:59,000
could be harnessed for good and making society better.

145
0:11:04.925,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So I'll come back to the story of when I was caught in the prison:

146
0:11:11.692,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I was very happy freeing a dozen children from slavery,

147
0:11:15.919,000 --> 0:11:17,000
handing them over to their parents.

148
0:11:18.89,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I cannot explain my joy when I free a child.

149
0:11:23.238,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I was so happy.

150
0:11:25.458,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But when I was waiting for my train to come back to my hometown, Delhi,

151
0:11:31.021,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I saw that dozens of children were arriving;

152
0:11:34.264,000 --> 0:11:37,000
they were being trafficked by someone.

153
0:11:37.562,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I stopped them, those people.

154
0:11:40.415,000 --> 0:11:42,000
I complained to the police.

155
0:11:42.517,000 --> 0:11:46,000
So the policemen, instead of helping me,

156
0:11:47.071,000 --> 0:11:52,000
they threw me in this small, tiny shell, like an animal.

157
0:11:53.573,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And that was the night of anger

158
0:11:55.121,000 --> 0:11:58,000
when one of the brightest and biggest ideas was born.

159
0:11:59.632,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I thought that if I keep on freeing 10 children, and 50 more will join,

160
0:12:05.1,000 --> 0:12:06,000
that's not done.

161
0:12:06.56,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And I believed in the power of consumers,

162
0:12:09.368,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and let me tell you that this was the first time

163
0:12:12.852,000 --> 0:12:17,000
when a campaign was launched by me or anywhere in the world,

164
0:12:17.968,000 --> 0:12:21,000
to educate and sensitize the consumers

165
0:12:22.041,000 --> 0:12:26,000
to create a demand for child-labor-free rugs.

166
0:12:27.691,000 --> 0:12:3,000
In Europe and America, we have been successful.

167
0:12:31.083,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And it has resulted in a fall in child labor

168
0:12:35.768,000 --> 0:12:38,000
in South Asian countries by 80 percent.

169
0:12:39.024,000 --> 0:12:42,000
(Applause)

170
0:12:44.736,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Not only that, but this first-ever consumer's power, or consumer's campaign

171
0:12:51.397,000 --> 0:12:55,000
has grown in other countries and other industries,

172
0:12:55.505,000 --> 0:13:,000
maybe chocolate, maybe apparel, maybe shoes -- it has gone beyond.

173
0:13:03.271,000 --> 0:13:04,000
My anger at the age of 11,

174
0:13:04.823,000 --> 0:13:09,000
when I realized how important education is for every child,

175
0:13:10.176,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I got an idea to collect used books and help the poorest children.

176
0:13:17.821,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I created a book bank at the age of 11.

177
0:13:22.57,000 --> 0:13:23,000
But I did not stop.

178
0:13:23.813,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Later on, I cofounded

179
0:13:26.046,000 --> 0:13:3,000
the world's single largest civil society campaign for education

180
0:13:30.58,000 --> 0:13:32,000
that is the Global Campaign for Education.

181
0:13:34.221,000 --> 0:13:38,000
That has helped in changing the whole thinking towards education

182
0:13:38.866,000 --> 0:13:4,000
from the charity mode to the human rights mode,

183
0:13:41.257,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and that has concretely helped the reduction of out-of-school children

184
0:13:46.026,000 --> 0:13:49,000
by half in the last 15 years.

185
0:13:49.614,000 --> 0:13:53,000
(Applause)

186
0:13:55.753,000 --> 0:13:58,000
My anger at the age of 27,

187
0:13:58.867,000 --> 0:14:03,000
to free that girl who was about to be sold to a brothel,

188
0:14:04.235,000 --> 0:14:08,000
has given me an idea

189
0:14:09.018,000 --> 0:14:13,000
to go for a new strategy of raid and rescue,

190
0:14:13.271,000 --> 0:14:15,000
freeing children from slavery.

191
0:14:16.758,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And I am so lucky and proud to say that it is not one or 10 or 20,

192
0:14:22.614,000 --> 0:14:28,000
but my colleagues and I have been able to physically liberate 83,000 child slaves

193
0:14:28.962,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and hand them over back to their families and mothers.

194
0:14:32.093,000 --> 0:14:35,000
(Applause)

195
0:14:37.692,000 --> 0:14:39,000
I knew that we needed global policies.

196
0:14:39.979,000 --> 0:14:42,000
We organized the worldwide marches against child labor

197
0:14:43.011,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and that has also resulted in a new international convention

198
0:14:49.073,000 --> 0:14:53,000
to protect the children who are in the worst forms.

199
0:14:54.262,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And the concrete result was that the number of child laborers globally

200
0:14:58.351,000 --> 0:15:03,000
has gone down by one third in the last 15 years.

201
0:15:03.891,000 --> 0:15:07,000
(Applause)

202
0:15:08.311,000 --> 0:15:11,000
So, in each case,

203
0:15:11.721,000 --> 0:15:14,000
it began from anger,

204
0:15:15.51,000 --> 0:15:17,000
turned into an idea,

205
0:15:18.159,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and action.

206
0:15:21.565,000 --> 0:15:23,000
So anger, what next?

207
0:15:24.441,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Idea, and --

208
0:15:26.92,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Audience: Action

209
0:15:28.278,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Kailash Satyarthi: Anger, idea, action. Which I tried to do.

210
0:15:34.254,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Anger is a power, anger is an energy,

211
0:15:36.751,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and the law of nature is that energy

212
0:15:39.552,000 --> 0:15:44,000
can never be created and never be vanished, can never be destroyed.

213
0:15:44.795,000 --> 0:15:5,000
So why can't the energy of anger be translated and harnessed

214
0:15:51.685,000 --> 0:15:55,000
to create a better and beautiful world, a more just and equitable world?

215
0:15:56.861,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Anger is within each one of you,

216
0:15:59.341,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and I will share a secret for a few seconds:

217
0:16:05.241,000 --> 0:16:12,000
that if we are confined in the narrow shells of egos,

218
0:16:12.795,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and the circles of selfishness,

219
0:16:17.225,000 --> 0:16:24,000
then the anger will turn out to be hatred, violence, revenge, destruction.

220
0:16:25.539,000 --> 0:16:28,000
But if we are able to break the circles,

221
0:16:28.595,000 --> 0:16:33,000
then the same anger could turn into a great power.

222
0:16:34.481,000 --> 0:16:38,000
We can break the circles by using our inherent compassion

223
0:16:38.828,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and connect with the world through compassion to make this world better.

224
0:16:42.678,000 --> 0:16:45,000
That same anger could be transformed into it.

225
0:16:46.351,000 --> 0:16:5,000
So dear friends, sisters and brothers, again, as a Nobel Laureate,

226
0:16:51.956,000 --> 0:16:53,000
I am urging you to become angry.

227
0:16:55.841,000 --> 0:16:58,000
I am urging you to become angry.

228
0:17:00.003,000 --> 0:17:04,000
And the angriest among us

229
0:17:04.299,000 --> 0:17:11,000
is the one who can transform his anger into idea and action.

230
0:17:12.44,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Thank you so much.

231
0:17:14.275,000 --> 0:17:17,000
(Applause)

232
0:17:27.115,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Chris Anderson: For many years, you've been an inspiration to others.

233
0:17:30.924,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Who or what inspires you and why?

234
0:17:34.629,000 --> 0:17:35,000
KS: Good question.

235
0:17:36.341,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Chris, let me tell you, and that is the truth,

236
0:17:40.335,000 --> 0:17:44,000
each time when I free a child,

237
0:17:44.849,000 --> 0:17:48,000
the child who has lost all his hope that he will ever come back to his mother,

238
0:17:49.028,000 --> 0:17:53,000
the first smile of freedom,

239
0:17:53.335,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and the mother who has lost all hope

240
0:17:55.89,000 --> 0:18:01,000
that the son or daughter can ever come back and sit in her lap,

241
0:18:02.501,000 --> 0:18:04,000
they become so emotional

242
0:18:04.656,000 --> 0:18:09,000
and the first tear of joy rolls down on her cheek,

243
0:18:09.809,000 --> 0:18:12,000
I see the glimpse of God in it -- this is my biggest inspiration.

244
0:18:13.154,000 --> 0:18:17,000
And I am so lucky that not once, as I said before, but thousands of times,

245
0:18:18.032,000 --> 0:18:21,000
I have been able to witness my God in the faces of those children

246
0:18:21.628,000 --> 0:18:23,000
and they are my biggest inspirations.

247
0:18:23.64,000 --> 0:18:25,000
Thank you.

248
0:18:25.652,000 --> 0:18:27,000
(Applause)

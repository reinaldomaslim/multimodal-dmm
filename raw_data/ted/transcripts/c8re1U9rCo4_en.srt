1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
How do you observe something you can't see?

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
This is the basic question of somebody who's interested

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in finding and studying black holes.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Because black holes are objects

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
whose pull of gravity is so intense

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that nothing can escape it, not even light,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
so you can't see it directly.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So, my story today about black holes

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
is about one particular black hole.

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I'm interested in finding whether or not

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
there is a really massive, what we like to call

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
"supermassive" black hole at the center of our galaxy.

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And the reason this is interesting is that

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
it gives us an opportunity to prove

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
whether or not these exotic objects really exist.

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And second, it gives us the opportunity

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to understand how these supermassive black holes

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
interact with their environment,

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
of the galaxies which they reside in.

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So, to begin with,

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
we need to understand what a black hole is

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
so we can understand the proof of a black hole.

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So, what is a black hole?

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Well, in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object,

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
because there are only three characteristics that you can describe:

27
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the mass,

28
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the spin, and the charge.

29
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And I'm going to only talk about the mass.

30
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So, in that sense, it's a very simple object.

31
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But in another sense, it's an incredibly complicated object

32
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that we need relatively exotic physics to describe,

33
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding

34
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
of the universe.

35
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But today, the way I want you to understand a black hole,

36
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
for the proof of a black hole,

37
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
is to think of it as an object

38
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
whose mass is confined to zero volume.

39
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So, despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about

40
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
an object that's supermassive,

41
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment,

42
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
it has no finite size.

43
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So, this is a little tricky.

44
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But fortunately there is a finite size that you can see,

45
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and that's known as the Schwarzschild radius.

46
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And that's named after the guy who recognized

47
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
why it was such an important radius.

48
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
This is a virtual radius, not reality; the black hole has no size.

49
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So why is it so important?

50
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It's important because it tells us

51
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that any object can become a black hole.

52
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
That means you, your neighbor, your cellphone,

53
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
the auditorium can become a black hole

54
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
if you can figure out how to compress it down

55
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to the size of the Schwarzschild radius.

56
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
At that point, what's going to happen?

57
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
At that point gravity wins.

58
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Gravity wins over all other known forces.

59
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And the object is forced to continue to collapse

60
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to an infinitely small object.

61
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And then it's a black hole.

62
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So, if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube,

63
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
it would become a black hole,

64
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
because the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius.

65
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Now, the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is.

66
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out.

67
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It depends only on the mass of the object.

68
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii.

69
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii.

70
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So, if I were to take the sun

71
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford,

72
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
it would become a black hole.

73
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So, now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is.

74
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And it's actually quite a useful concept,

75
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
because it tells us not only

76
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
when a black hole will form,

77
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole.

78
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I only need two things.

79
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I need to understand the mass of the object

80
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I'm claiming is a black hole,

81
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and what its Schwarzschild radius is.

82
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius,

83
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
there is actually only one thing I really need to know.

84
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So, my job in convincing you

85
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that there is a black hole

86
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
is to show that there is some object

87
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius.

88
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And your job today is to be skeptical.

89
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Okay, so, I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole;

90
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I'm going to talk about supermassive black holes.

91
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So, I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is,

92
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole.

93
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
An ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state

94
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
of a really massive star's life.

95
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So, if a star starts its life off

96
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
with much more mass than the mass of the Sun,

97
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
it's going to end its life by exploding

98
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here.

99
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And inside that supernova remnant

100
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is going to be a little black hole

101
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun.

102
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
On an astronomical scale

103
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that's a very small black hole.

104
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Now, what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes.

105
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies.

106
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope

107
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes.

108
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
There are big ones. There are little ones.

109
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy.

110
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
And there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left.

111
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy,

112
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
just to give you a sense of scale.

113
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And all the light that we see from a typical galaxy,

114
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
which is the kind of galaxies that we're seeing here,

115
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
comes from the light from the stars.

116
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So, we see the galaxy because of the star light.

117
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Now, there are a few relatively exotic galaxies.

118
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world,

119
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
because they are kind of show offs.

120
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And we call them active galactic nuclei.

121
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And we call them that because their nucleus,

122
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
or their center, are very active.

123
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So, at the center there, that's actually where

124
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
most of the starlight comes out from.

125
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And yet, what we actually see is light

126
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that can't be explained by the starlight.

127
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It's way more energetic.

128
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
In fact, in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here.

129
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
There are also jets emanating out from the center.

130
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Again, a source of energy that's very difficult to explain

131
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars.

132
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So, what people have thought is that perhaps

133
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
there are supermassive black holes

134
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
which matter is falling on to.

135
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So, you can't see the black hole itself,

136
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole

137
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
into the light we see.

138
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So, there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes

139
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
exist at the center of galaxies.

140
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But it's a kind of indirect argument.

141
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Nonetheless, it's given rise to the notion

142
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that maybe it's not just these prima donnas

143
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that have these supermassive black holes,

144
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but rather all galaxies might harbor these

145
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
supermassive black holes at their centers.

146
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And if that's the case -- and this is an example of a normal galaxy;

147
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
what we see is the star light.

148
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And if there is a supermassive black hole,

149
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet.

150
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see

151
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
in active galactic nuclei.

152
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
If we're going to look for these stealth black holes

153
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
at the center of galaxies,

154
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
the best place to look is in our own galaxy, our Milky Way.

155
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And this is a wide field picture

156
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
taken of the center of the Milky Way.

157
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And what we see is a line of stars.

158
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
And that is because we live in a galaxy which has

159
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
a flattened, disk-like structure.

160
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And we live in the middle of it, so when we look towards the center,

161
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy,

162
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
or line that defines the plane of the galaxy.

163
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Now, the advantage of studying our own galaxy

164
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
is it's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy

165
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that we're ever going to have, because the next closest galaxy

166
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
is 100 times further away.

167
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So, we can see far more detail in our galaxy

168
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
than anyplace else.

169
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And as you'll see in a moment, the ability to see detail

170
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is key to this experiment.

171
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So, how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass

172
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
inside a small volume?

173
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Which is the job that I have to show you today.

174
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And the tool that we use is to watch the way

175
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
stars orbit the black hole.

176
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Stars will orbit the black hole

177
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
in the very same way that planets orbit the sun.

178
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It's the gravitational pull

179
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that makes these things orbit.

180
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
If there were no massive objects these things would go flying off,

181
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
or at least go at a much slower rate

182
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
because all that determines how they go around

183
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
is how much mass is inside its orbit.

184
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
So, this is great, because remember my job is to show

185
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
there is a lot of mass inside a small volume.

186
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So, if I know how fast it goes around, I know the mass.

187
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius.

188
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So, I want to see the stars

189
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible.

190
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible.

191
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So, this means that I want to see a lot of detail.

192
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And that's the reason that for this experiment we've used

193
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
the world's largest telescope.

194
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
This is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes

195
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
with a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly

196
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
the diameter of a tennis court.

197
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Now, this is wonderful,

198
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
because the campaign promise

199
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope,

200
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
the smaller the detail that we can see.

201
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
But it turns out these telescopes, or any telescope on the ground

202
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise.

203
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And that is because of the atmosphere.

204
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Atmosphere is great for us; it allows us

205
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
to survive here on Earth.

206
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
But it's relatively challenging for astronomers

207
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
who want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources.

208
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So, to give you a sense of what this is like,

209
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
it's actually like looking at a pebble

210
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
at the bottom of a stream.

211
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Looking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream,

212
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
the stream is continuously moving and turbulent,

213
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream.

214
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Very much in the same way, it's very difficult

215
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to see astronomical sources, because of the

216
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
atmosphere that's continuously moving by.

217
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So, I've spent a lot of my career working on ways

218
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
to correct for the atmosphere, to give us a cleaner view.

219
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And that buys us about a factor of 20.

220
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And I think all of you can agree that if you can

221
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
figure out how to improve life by a factor of 20,

222
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
you've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot,

223
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
say your salary, you'd notice, or your kids, you'd notice.

224
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And this animation here shows you one example of

225
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
the techniques that we use, called adaptive optics.

226
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
You're seeing an animation that goes between

227
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
an example of what you would see if you don't use this technique --

228
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
in other words, just a picture that shows the stars --

229
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy,

230
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
where we think the black hole is.

231
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So, without this technology you can't see the stars.

232
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
With this technology all of a sudden you can see it.

233
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
This technology works by introducing a mirror

234
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
into the telescope optics system

235
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you.

236
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So, it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope.

237
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Now, in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on

238
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that little square there.

239
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So, we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square,

240
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
although we've looked at all of them.

241
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So, I want to see how these things have moved.

242
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And over the course of this experiment, these stars

243
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
have moved a tremendous amount.

244
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So, we've been doing this experiment for 15 years,

245
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and we see the stars go all the way around.

246
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Now, most astronomers have a favorite star,

247
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and mine today is a star that's labeled up there, SO-2.

248
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Absolutely my favorite star in the world.

249
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And that's because it goes around in only 15 years.

250
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And to give you a sense of how short that is,

251
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
the sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy.

252
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Stars that we knew about before, that were as close to the center of the galaxy

253
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
as possible, take 500 years.

254
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And this one, this one goes around in a human lifetime.

255
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
That's kind of profound, in a way.

256
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
But it's the key to this experiment. The orbit tells me

257
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
how much mass is inside a very small radius.

258
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So, next we see a picture here that shows you

259
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
before this experiment the size to which we could

260
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
confine the mass of the center of the galaxy.

261
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
What we knew before is that there was four million

262
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
times the mass of the sun inside that circle.

263
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And as you can see, there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle.

264
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
You can see a lot of stars.

265
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So, there was actually lots of alternatives

266
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy,

267
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
because you could put a lot of stuff in there.

268
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
But with this experiment, we've confined

269
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
that same mass to a much smaller volume

270
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that's 10,000 times smaller.

271
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And because of that, we've been able to show

272
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that there is a supermassive black hole there.

273
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
To give you a sense of how small that size is,

274
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
that's the size of our solar system.

275
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
So, we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun

276
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
into that small volume.

277
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Now, truth in advertising. Right?

278
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
I have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius.

279
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And the truth is, I'm not quite there.

280
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
But we actually have no alternative today

281
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
to explaining this concentration of mass.

282
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And, in fact, it's the best evidence we have to date

283
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
for not only existence of a supermassive black hole

284
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
at the center of our own galaxy, but any in our universe.

285
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So, what next? I actually think

286
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
this is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology,

287
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
so let's move on with the problem.

288
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So, what I want to tell you, very briefly,

289
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
is a few examples

290
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
of the excitement of what we can do today

291
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
at the center of the galaxy, now that we know that there is,

292
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
or at least we believe,

293
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that there is a supermassive black hole there.

294
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And the fun phase of this experiment

295
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
is, while we've tested some of our ideas

296
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
about the consequences of a supermassive black hole

297
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
being at the center of our galaxy,

298
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
almost every single one

299
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
has been inconsistent with what we actually see.

300
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And that's the fun.

301
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
So, let me give you the two examples.

302
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
You can ask, "What do you expect

303
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
for the old stars, stars that have been around the center of the galaxy

304
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
for a long time, they've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole."

305
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
What you expect there is that old stars

306
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
should be very clustered around the black hole.

307
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole.

308
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Likewise, for the young stars, or in contrast, the young stars,

309
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
they just should not be there.

310
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery.

311
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
To get a star to form, you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse.

312
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And it's a very fragile entity.

313
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And what does the big black hole do?

314
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
It strips that gas cloud apart.

315
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
It pulls much stronger on one side than the other

316
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and the cloud is stripped apart.

317
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
In fact, we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment.

318
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
So, you shouldn't see young stars.

319
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
So, what do we see?

320
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Using observations that are not the ones I've shown you today,

321
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young.

322
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
The old ones are red.

323
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
The young ones are blue. And the yellow ones, we don't know yet.

324
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
So, you can already see the surprise.

325
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
There is a dearth of old stars.

326
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
There is an abundance of young stars, so it's the exact opposite of the prediction.

327
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
So, this is the fun part.

328
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And in fact, today, this is what we're trying to figure out,

329
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
this mystery of how do you get --

330
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
how do you resolve this contradiction.

331
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
So, in fact, my graduate students

332
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
are, at this very moment, today, at the telescope,

333
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
in Hawaii, making observations to get us

334
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
hopefully to the next stage,

335
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
where we can address this question

336
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
of why are there so many young stars,

337
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and so few old stars.

338
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits

339
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
of stars that are much further away.

340
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
To do that we'll probably need much more

341
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
sophisticated technology than we have today.

342
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Because, in truth, while I said we're correcting

343
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
for the Earth's atmosphere, we actually only

344
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
correct for half the errors that are introduced.

345
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
We do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere,

346
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and what we think we can do is if we

347
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
shine a few more that we can correct the rest.

348
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
So this is what we hope to do in the next few years.

349
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And on a much longer time scale,

350
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes,

351
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
because, remember, bigger is better in astronomy.

352
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
So, we want to build a 30 meter telescope.

353
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
And with this telescope we should be able to see

354
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy.

355
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And we hope to be able to test some of

356
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Einstein's theories of general relativity,

357
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form.

358
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
So, we think the future of this experiment

359
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
is quite exciting.

360
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
So, in conclusion, I'm going to show you an animation

361
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
that basically shows you how these

362
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
orbits have been moving, in three dimensions.

363
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And I hope, if nothing else,

364
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
I've convinced you that, one, we do in fact

365
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.

366
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And this means that these things do exist in our universe,

367
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and we have to contend with this, we have to explain

368
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
how you can get these objects in our physical world.

369
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Second, we've been able to look at that interaction

370
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
of how supermassive black holes interact,

371
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and understand, maybe, the role in which they play

372
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
in shaping what galaxies are, and how they work.

373
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And last but not least,

374
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
none of this would have happened

375
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
without the advent of the tremendous progress

376
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
that's been made on the technology front.

377
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast,

378
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and holds a lot in store for the future.

379
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Thanks very much.

380
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000

1
0:00:15.33,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Everybody in our society's life is touched by cancer --

2
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
if not personally,

3
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
then through a loved one, a family member,

4
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
colleague, friend.

5
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And once our lives are touched by cancer,

6
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
we quickly learn

7
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that there are basically

8
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
three weapons, or three tools, that are available

9
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to fight the disease:

10
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.

11
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And once we get involved

12
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
in the therapeutic decisions,

13
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
again either personally

14
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
or with our loved ones and family members,

15
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
we also very quickly learn

16
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
the benefits, the trade-offs and the limitations

17
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
of these tools.

18
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I'm very thankful to Jay and to Mark

19
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and the TEDMED team

20
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
for inviting me today

21
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to describe a fourth tool, a new tool,

22
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that we call Tumor Treating Fields.

23
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Tumor Treating Fields

24
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
were invented by Dr. Yoram Palti,

25
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
professor emeritus at the Technion in Israel.

26
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And they use low-intensity

27
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
electric fields

28
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to fight cancer.

29
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
To understand how Tumor Treating Fields work,

30
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
we first need to understand

31
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
what are electric fields.

32
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Let me first address

33
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
a few popular misconceptions.

34
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
First of all, electric fields

35
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
are not an electric current

36
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that is coursing through the tissue.

37
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Electric fields

38
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
are not ionizing radiation,

39
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
like X-rays or proton beams,

40
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that bombard tissue

41
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to disrupt DNA.

42
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And electric fields

43
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
are not magnetism.

44
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
What electric fields are

45
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
are a field of forces.

46
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And these forces

47
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
act on, attract, bodies

48
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that have an electrical charge.

49
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
The best way to visualize an electric field

50
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
is to think of gravity.

51
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Gravity is also a field of forces

52
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that act on masses.

53
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We can all picture astronauts in space.

54
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
They float freely in three dimensions

55
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
without any forces acting on them.

56
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But as that space shuttle

57
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
returns to Earth,

58
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and as the astronauts enter the Earth's gravitational field,

59
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
they begin to see the effects of gravity.

60
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
They begin to be attracted towards Earth.

61
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And as they land,

62
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
they're fully aligned in the gravitational field.

63
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We're, of course, all stuck in the Earth's gravitational field right now.

64
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
That's why you're all in your chairs.

65
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And that's why we have to use our muscle energy

66
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to stand up, to walk around

67
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and to lift things.

68
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
In cancer,

69
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
cells rapidly divide

70
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and lead to uncontrolled tumor growth.

71
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We can think of a cell

72
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
from an electrical perspective

73
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
as if it's a mini space station.

74
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And in that space station

75
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
we have the genetic material, the chromosomes,

76
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
within a nucleus.

77
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And out in the cytoplasmic soup

78
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
we have special proteins

79
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that are required for cell division

80
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that float freely in this soup

81
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
in three dimensions.

82
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Importantly, those special proteins

83
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
are among the most highly charged objects

84
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
in our body.

85
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
As cell division begins

86
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the nucleus disintegrates,

87
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
the chromosomes line up

88
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in the middle of the cell

89
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and those special proteins

90
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
undergo a three-dimensional sequence

91
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
whereby they attach

92
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and they literally click into place end-on-end

93
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
to form chains.

94
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
These chains

95
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
then progress and attach

96
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to the genetic material

97
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and pull the genetic material

98
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
from one cell into two cells.

99
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And this is exactly how

100
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
one cancer cell becomes two cancer cells,

101
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
two cancer cells become four cancer cells,

102
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and we have ultimately

103
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
uncontrolled tumor growth.

104
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Tumor Treating Fields

105
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
use externally placed transducers

106
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
attached to a field generator

107
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
to create an artificial electric field

108
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
on that space station.

109
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And when that cellular space station

110
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
is within the electric field,

111
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
it acts on those highly charged proteins

112
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and aligns them.

113
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And it prevents them from forming those chains,

114
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
those mitotic spindles,

115
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that are necessary to pull the genetic material

116
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
into the daughter cells.

117
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
What we see is that the cells will attempt to divide

118
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
for several hours.

119
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And they will either enter into

120
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
this so-called cellular suicide,

121
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
programmed cell death,

122
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
or they will form unhealthy daughter cells

123
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and enter into apoptosis

124
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
once they have divided.

125
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And we can observe this.

126
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
What I'm going to show you next

127
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
are two in vitro experiments.

128
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
This is cultures, identical cultures,

129
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
of cervical cancer cells.

130
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And we've stained these cultures

131
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
with a green florescent dye

132
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
so that we can look at these proteins

133
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that form these chains.

134
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
The first clip shows

135
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
a normal cell division

136
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
without the Tumor Treating Fields.

137
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
What we see

138
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
are, first of all, a very active culture,

139
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
a lot of divisions,

140
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and then very clear nuclei

141
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
once the cells have separated.

142
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
And we can see them dividing throughout.

143
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
When we apply the fields --

144
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
again, in the identical time-scale

145
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to the identical culture --

146
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
you're going to see something different.

147
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
The cells round up for division,

148
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
but they're very static in that position.

149
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
We'll see two cells

150
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
in the upper part of the screen

151
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
attempting to divide.

152
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
The one within the circle manages.

153
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
But see how much of the protein

154
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
is still throughout the nucleus,

155
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
even in the dividing cell.

156
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The one up there can't divide at all.

157
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And then this bubbling, this membrane bubbling,

158
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
is the hallmark

159
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
of apoptosis in this cell.

160
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Formation of healthy mitotic spindles

161
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
is necessary for division

162
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
in all cell types.

163
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
We've applied Tumor Treating Fields

164
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to over 20 different cancers in the lab,

165
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and we see this effect

166
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
in all of them.

167
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Now importantly,

168
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
these Tumor Treating Fields have no effect

169
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
on normal undividing cells.

170
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
10 years ago,

171
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Dr. Palti founded a company called Novocure

172
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to develop his discovery

173
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
into a practical therapy for patients.

174
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
In that time, Novocure's developed two systems --

175
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
one system for cancers in the head

176
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and another system for cancers in the trunk of the body.

177
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The first cancer that we have focused on

178
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
is the deadly brain cancer, GBM.

179
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
GBM affects about 10,000 people

180
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
in the U.S. each year.

181
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It's a death sentence.

182
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
The expected five year survival

183
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
is less than five percent.

184
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And the typical patient

185
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
with optimal therapy

186
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
survives just a little over a year,

187
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and only about seven months

188
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
from the time that the cancer is first treated

189
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
and then comes back and starts growing again.

190
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Novocure conducted

191
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
its first phase three randomized trial

192
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
in patients with recurrent GBM.

193
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So these are patients

194
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
who had received surgery,

195
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
high dose radiation to the head

196
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and first-line chemotherapy,

197
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and that had failed and their tumors had grown back.

198
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We divided the patients into two groups.

199
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
The first group received second-line chemotherapy,

200
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
which is expected to double the life expectancy,

201
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
versus no treatment at all.

202
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And then the second group

203
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
received only Tumor Treating Field therapy.

204
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
What we saw in that trial

205
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
is that that the life expectancies of both groups --

206
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
so the chemotherapy treated group

207
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and the Tumor Treating Field group --

208
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
was the same.

209
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
But importantly,

210
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
the Tumor Treating Field group

211
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
suffered none of the side effects

212
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
typical of chemotherapy patients.

213
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
They had no pain,

214
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
suffered none of the infections.

215
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
They had no nausea, diarrhea,

216
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
constipation, fatigue

217
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that would be expected.

218
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Based on this trial,

219
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
in April of this year,

220
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
the FDA approved Tumor Treating Fields

221
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
for the treatment of patients

222
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
with recurrent GBM.

223
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Importantly, it was the first time ever

224
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that the FDA included

225
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
in their approval of an oncology treatment

226
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
a quality of life claim.

227
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So I'm going to show you now

228
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
one of the patients

229
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
from this trial.

230
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Robert Dill-Bundi

231
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
is a famous Swiss cycling champion.

232
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
He won the gold medal in Moscow

233
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
in the 4,000 meter pursuit.

234
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And five years ago,

235
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Robert was diagnosed with GBM.

236
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
He received the standard treatments.

237
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
He received surgery.

238
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
He received high dose radiation to the head.

239
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And he received first-line chemotherapy.

240
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
A year after this treatment --

241
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
in fact, this is his baseline MRI.

242
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
You can see that the black regions

243
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
in the upper right quadrant

244
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
are the areas where he had surgery.

245
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And a year after that treatment,

246
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
his tumor grew back with a vengeance.

247
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
That cloudy white mass that you see

248
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
is the recurrence of the tumor.

249
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
At this point, he was told by his doctors

250
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that he had about 3 months to live.

251
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
He entered our trial.

252
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And here we can see him getting the therapy.

253
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
First of all, these electrodes are noninvasive.

254
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
They're attached to the skin

255
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
in the area of the tumor.

256
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Here you can see

257
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that a technician is placing them on there much like bandages.

258
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
The patients learn to do this themselves

259
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And then the patients

260
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
can undergo all the activities of their daily life.

261
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
There's none of the tiredness.

262
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
There's none of what is called the "chemo head."

263
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
There's no sensation.

264
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
It doesn't interfere

265
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
with computers or electrical equipment.

266
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And the therapy is delivered continuously

267
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
at home,

268
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
without having to go into the hospital

269
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
either periodically or continually.

270
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
These are Robert's MRIs,

271
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
again, under only TTField treatment.

272
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
This is a therapy that takes time to work.

273
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
It's a medical device;

274
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
it works when it's on.

275
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
But what we can see is, by month six,

276
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
the tumor has responded

277
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and it's begun to melt away.

278
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
It's still there.

279
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
By month 12,

280
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
we could argue whether

281
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
there's a little bit of material around the edges,

282
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
but it's essentially completely gone.

283
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
It's now five years

284
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
since Robert's diagnosis,

285
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and he's alive,

286
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
but importantly, he's healthy

287
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and he's at work.

288
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I'm going to let him, in this very short clip,

289
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
describe his impressions of the therapy

290
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
in his own words.

291
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
(Video) Robert Dill-Bundi: My quality of life,

292
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I rate what I have today

293
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
a bit different than what most people would assume.

294
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
I am the happiest, the happiest person in the world.

295
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And every single morning I appreciate life.

296
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Every night I fall asleep very well,

297
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and I am, I repeat,

298
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
the happiest man in the world,

299
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and I'm thankful I am alive.

300
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
BD: Novocure's also working on lung cancer

301
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
as the second target.

302
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
We've run a phase two trial

303
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
in Switzerland

304
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
on, again, recurrent patients --

305
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
patients who have received standard therapy

306
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and whose cancer has come back.

307
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I'm going to show you another clip

308
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
of a woman named Lydia.

309
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Lydia's a 66 year-old farmer

310
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
in Switzerland.

311
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
She was diagnosed with lung cancer

312
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
five years ago.

313
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
She underwent four different regimes of chemotherapy

314
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
over two years,

315
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
none of which had an effect.

316
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Her cancer continued to grow.

317
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Three years ago,

318
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
she entered the Novocure lung cancer trial.

319
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
You can see, in her case,

320
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
she's wearing her transducer arrays,

321
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
one of the front of her chest, one on the back,

322
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and then the second pair side-to-side over the liver.

323
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
You can see the Tumor Treating Field field generator,

324
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
but importantly you can also see that she is living her life.

325
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
She is managing her farm.

326
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
She's interacting with her kids and her grand kids.

327
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And when we talked to her,

328
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
she said that when she was undergoing chemotherapy,

329
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
she had to go to the hospital every month for her infusions.

330
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
Her whole family suffered

331
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
as her side effect profile came and went.

332
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Now she can run

333
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
all of the activities of her farm.

334
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
It's only the beginning.

335
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
(Applause)

336
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
In the lab, we've observed tremendous synergies

337
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
between chemotherapy and Tumor Treating Fields.

338
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
There's research underway now at Harvard Medical School

339
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
to pick the optimum pairs

340
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
to maximize that benefit.

341
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
We also believe that Tumor Treating Fields will work with radiation

342
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and interrupt the self-repair mechanisms that we have.

343
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
There's now a new research project underway

344
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
at the Karolinska in Sweden

345
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
to prove that hypothesis.

346
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
We have more trials planned

347
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
for lung cancer,

348
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer

349
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and breast cancer.

350
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And I firmly believe

351
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
that in the next 10 years

352
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Tumor Treating Fields

353
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
will be a weapon available to doctors and patients

354
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
for all of these most-difficult-to-treat solid tumors.

355
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
I'm also very hopeful

356
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
that in the next decades,

357
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
we will make big strides

358
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
on reducing that death rate

359
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that has been so challenging in this disease.

360
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Thank you.

361
0:15:20.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000

1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I'm a medical illustrator,

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and I come from a slightly different point of view.

3
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I've been watching, since I grew up,

4
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:38,000
the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts

5
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and truth and beauty in the sciences.

6
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And while these are both wonderful things in their own right --

7
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:46,000
they both have very wonderful things going for them --

8
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:52,000
truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences

9
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins

10
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that a scientist would want to date.

11
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

12
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:07,000
These are expressions of truth as awe-full things,

13
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:09,000
by meaning they are things you can worship.

14
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:14,000
They are ideals that are powerful. They are irreducible.

15
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:17,000
They are unique. They are useful --

16
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:19,000
sometimes, often a long time after the fact.

17
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And you can actually roll some of the pictures now,

18
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:25,000
because I don't want to look at me on the screen.

19
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Truth and beauty are things

20
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences.

21
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
They are things that describe beauty in a way

22
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that is often only accessible if you understand the language

23
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and the syntax of the person

24
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:49,000
who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed.

25
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:52,000
If you look at the math, E=mc squared,

26
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
if you look at the cosmological constant,

27
0:01:55,000 --> 0:02:,000
where there's an anthropic ideal, where you see that life had to evolve

28
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:03,000
from the numbers that describe the universe --

29
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:06,000
these are things that are really difficult to understand.

30
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And what I've tried to do

31
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:09,000
since I had my training as a medical illustrator --

32
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:12,000
since I was taught animation by my father,

33
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
who was a sculptor and my visual mentor --

34
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I wanted to figure out a way to help people

35
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:23,000
understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences

36
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
by using animation, by using pictures, by telling stories

37
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:32,000
so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people

38
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:36,000
can be brought forth, and can be taught, and can be understood.

39
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Students today are often immersed in an environment

40
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:47,000
where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty

41
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:52,000
embedded in them, but the way they're taught is compartmentalized

42
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and it's drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty

43
0:02:57,000 --> 0:02:58,000
are not always evident.

44
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup

45
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:05,000
where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone.

46
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
We don't want to do that to our students.

47
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So we have an opportunity to really open up education.

48
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And I had a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard,

49
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:17,000
in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department,

50
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:2,000
a couple of years ago. He asked me if my team and I

51
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:25,000
would be interested and willing to really change

52
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:28,000
how medical and scientific education is done at Harvard.

53
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So we embarked on a project that would explore the cell --

54
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that would explore the truth and beauty inherent

55
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:38,000
in molecular and cellular biology

56
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:41,000
so that students could understand a larger picture

57
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that they could hang all of these facts on.

58
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:47,000
They could have a mental image of the cell

59
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:54,000
as a large, bustling, hugely complicated city

60
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that's occupied by micro-machines.

61
0:03:57,000 --> 0:04:,000
And these micro-machines really are at the heart of life.

62
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:01,000
These micro-machines,

63
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:04,000
which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over,

64
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:12,000
are self-directed, powerful, precise, accurate devices

65
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that are made out of strings of amino acids.

66
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And these micro-machines power how a cell moves.

67
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:24,000
They power how a cell replicates. They power our hearts.

68
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:25,000
They power our minds.

69
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And so what we wanted to do was to figure out

70
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:32,000
how we could make this story into an animation

71
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard,

72
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:41,000
which is a website that Harvard has

73
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:43,000
for its molecular and cellular biology students

74
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that will -- in addition to all the textual information,

75
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:49,000
in addition to all the didactic stuff --

76
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:52,000
put everything together visually, so that these students

77
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:57,000
would have an internalized view of what a cell really is

78
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:01,000
in all of its truth and beauty, and be able to study

79
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:05,000
with this view in mind, so that their imaginations would be sparked,

80
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:07,000
so that their passions would be sparked

81
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and so that they would be able to go on

82
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries

83
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and to be able to find out, really, how life works.

84
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together.

85
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We worked with a theme, which is, you've got macrophages

86
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that are streaming down a capillary,

87
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and they're touching the surface of the capillary wall,

88
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and they're picking up information from cells

89
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that are on the capillary wall, and they are given this information

90
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that there's an inflammation somewhere outside,

91
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:46,000
where they can't see and sense.

92
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:49,000
But they get the information that causes them to stop,

93
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:53,000
causes them to internalize that they need to make

94
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:57,000
all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape,

95
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and try to get out of this capillary and find out what's going on.

96
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So these molecular motors -- we had to work

97
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:1,000
with the Harvard scientists and databank models

98
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:14,000
of the atomically accurate molecules

99
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and figure out how they moved, and figure out what they did.

100
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And figure out how to do this in a way

101
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on,

102
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell

103
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:34,000
would prevent the vista from happening.

104
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And so what I'm going to show you is a three-minute

105
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Reader's Digest version of the first aspect of this film

106
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that we produced. It's an ongoing project

107
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that's going to go another four or five years.

108
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And I want you to look at this

109
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and see the paths that the cell manufactures --

110
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:56,000
these little walking machines, they're called kinesins --

111
0:06:57,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that take these huge loads

112
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that would challenge an ant in relative size.

113
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Run the movie, please.

114
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But these machines that power the inside of the cells

115
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:13,000
are really quite amazing, and they really are the basis of all life

116
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:17,000
because all of these machines interact with each other.

117
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:19,000
They pass information to each other.

118
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:22,000
They cause different things to happen inside the cell.

119
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs

120
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
on the fly, from information

121
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes.

122
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
No life, from the smallest life to everybody here,

123
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:4,000
would be possible without these little micro-machines.

124
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:44,000
In fact, it would really, in the absence of these machines,

125
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:47,000
have made the attendance here, Chris, really quite sparse.

126
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Laughter)

127
0:07:51,000 --> 0:08:03,000
(Music)

128
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:05,000
This is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell.

129
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:08,000
This little guy is called the kinesin,

130
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteins

131
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to wherever it's needed in the cell --

132
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:18,000
whether it's to a membrane, whether it's to an organelle,

133
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:2,000
whether it's to build something or repair something.

134
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And each of us has about 100,000 of these things

135
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:25,000
running around, right now,

136
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
inside each one of your 100 trillion cells.

137
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So no matter how lazy you feel,

138
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:34,000
you're not really intrinsically doing nothing.

139
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Laughter)

140
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So what I want you to do when you go home

141
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:43,000
is think about this, and think about how powerful our cells are.

142
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And think about some of the things

143
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that we're learning about cellular mechanics.

144
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Once we figure out all that's going on --

145
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and believe me, we know almost a percent of what's going on --

146
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:57,000
once we figure out what's going on,

147
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:,000
we're really going to be able to have a lot of control

148
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:02,000
over what we do with our health,

149
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:05,000
with what we do with future generations,

150
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and how long we're going to live.

151
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And hopefully we'll be able to use this

152
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to discover more truth, and more beauty.

153
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:26,000
(Music)

154
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
But it's really quite amazing that these cells, these micro-machines,

155
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:36,000
are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding.

156
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:4,000
They work together. They make the cell do what it needs to do.

157
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And their working together helps our bodies --

158
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:5,000
huge entities that they will never see -- function properly.

159
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Enjoy the rest of the show. Thank you.

160
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Applause)

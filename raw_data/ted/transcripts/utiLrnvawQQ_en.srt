1
0:00:13.146,000 --> 0:00:15,000
There is something we desperately need

2
0:00:15.968,000 --> 0:00:17,000
that we cannot stop doing:

3
0:00:18.912,000 --> 0:00:19,000
it is breathing.

4
0:00:20.596,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Do you want to try?

5
0:00:22.234,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Why don't we stop breathing together

6
0:00:25.026,000 --> 0:00:28,000
for, let's say, even 10 seconds.

7
0:00:28.206,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Is that OK?

8
0:00:29.388,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Let's do it.

9
0:00:30.849,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Get ready ... OK, now!

10
0:00:51.248,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Oof, difficult, isn't it?

11
0:00:54.411,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Well, this is an incredible number

12
0:00:57.66,000 --> 0:01:,000
that will again take your breath away:

13
0:01:01.389,000 --> 0:01:02,000
seven.

14
0:01:02.625,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Seven what?

15
0:01:03.967,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Seven million premature deaths a year

16
0:01:08.077,000 --> 0:01:13,000
caused by exposure to the bad quality of the air we breathe.

17
0:01:13.741,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Imagine -- it's like more than the entire population of my dear Madrid

18
0:01:18.649,000 --> 0:01:21,000
will be wiped out in one year.

19
0:01:22.378,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And you may ask:

20
0:01:23.644,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Has this information been disclosed?

21
0:01:26.029,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Has this information been publicized, distributed?

22
0:01:30.153,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Well, yes.

23
0:01:31.466,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We have at the moment more than 70,000 scientific papers

24
0:01:36.629,000 --> 0:01:41,000
examining the relationship between air pollution and our health,

25
0:01:42.689,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and the global media has been regularly covering this issue.

26
0:01:47.151,000 --> 0:01:5,000
In fact, in a relatively short period of time,

27
0:01:50.521,000 --> 0:01:51,000
we have come to know

28
0:01:52.232,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that air pollution is having a negative impact

29
0:01:56.274,000 --> 0:02:,000
on almost all our major organs.

30
0:02:01.275,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Let's start by the lungs.

31
0:02:03.44,000 --> 0:02:06,000
When we think about air pollution, we always think about the lungs.

32
0:02:06.941,000 --> 0:02:09,000
In fact, every time we take a breath,

33
0:02:10.585,000 --> 0:02:13,000
we are inhaling toxic pollutants,

34
0:02:14.408,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and our poor pink and lovely lungs

35
0:02:18.728,000 --> 0:02:19,000
are suffering all of that.

36
0:02:22.132,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Over the last 10 years,

37
0:02:24.484,000 --> 0:02:28,000
we have put together a lot of knowledge about what's happened to that,

38
0:02:29.03,000 --> 0:02:32,000
but let me tell you first what is air pollution.

39
0:02:32.89,000 --> 0:02:36,000
OK, air pollution is a very complex mixture

40
0:02:36.919,000 --> 0:02:39,000
of solid particles,

41
0:02:40.632,000 --> 0:02:41,000
liquid droplets

42
0:02:42.528,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and gaseous chemicals.

43
0:02:44.692,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Imagine all of this mixture

44
0:02:46.542,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that might come from sources like household fuel burning

45
0:02:52.451,000 --> 0:02:54,000
or industry or traffic

46
0:02:54.65,000 --> 0:02:58,000
or many other indoor and outdoor sources.

47
0:02:58.801,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And, of course, different sources of pollution

48
0:03:02.724,000 --> 0:03:06,000
will make different mixtures of pollutants.

49
0:03:07.512,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The point is that all of these toxins,

50
0:03:10.737,000 --> 0:03:12,000
they can be combined in different ways.

51
0:03:13.144,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Let's take, for instance, the particulate matter, the PM.

52
0:03:17.674,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It can be a mixture that will include --

53
0:03:20.838,000 --> 0:03:21,000
look at the cocktail here --

54
0:03:22.385,000 --> 0:03:25,000
soil and road dust,

55
0:03:25.43,000 --> 0:03:26,000
sea salt,

56
0:03:27.199,000 --> 0:03:28,000
toxic metals,

57
0:03:28.872,000 --> 0:03:3,000
diesel smog,

58
0:03:31.172,000 --> 0:03:33,000
nitrates and sulfates,

59
0:03:33.438,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and all of this toxic poison, this delicious cocktail,

60
0:03:37.608,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is going through our lungs every day,

61
0:03:41.251,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and we are constantly exposed to this air pollution

62
0:03:44.121,000 --> 0:03:46,000
because we cannot stop breathing.

63
0:03:46.17,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I mean, we can do it for 10 seconds, but no more than that.

64
0:03:50.157,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We cannot stop breathing

65
0:03:51.804,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and, in addition,

66
0:03:53.329,000 --> 0:03:59,000
we need, every day, around 10,000 liters of air.

67
0:04:00.688,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So we said that we have seven million deaths

68
0:04:03.968,000 --> 0:04:05,000
caused by air pollution every year.

69
0:04:06.484,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Are we panicking?

70
0:04:08.783,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Are we keeping calm?

71
0:04:10.685,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Are we declaring a national disaster, a global emergency?

72
0:04:15.769,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Well, no, and in fact I'm asking myself this question every day:

73
0:04:20.855,000 --> 0:04:21,000
What is happening?

74
0:04:22.57,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But here is something that maybe will force us to react more quickly.

75
0:04:29.54,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Air pollution is not just affecting our lungs.

76
0:04:33.1,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It's affecting our brain as well.

77
0:04:36.194,000 --> 0:04:37,000
This is our brain.

78
0:04:38.186,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Beautiful.

79
0:04:39.375,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We all have it.

80
0:04:40.679,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We all need it.

81
0:04:43.063,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Hopefully, we all use it --

82
0:04:45.604,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:46.697,000 --> 0:04:47,000
some more than others.

84
0:04:48.816,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And in the last 10 years of history,

85
0:04:51.754,000 --> 0:04:54,000
the research about the relationship between air pollution

86
0:04:55.635,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and our brain's health

87
0:04:57.308,000 --> 0:04:59,000
has been increased dramatically,

88
0:04:59.577,000 --> 0:05:03,000
so maybe now our brain is going up in smoke.

89
0:05:04.991,000 --> 0:05:05,000
But let me tell you the evidence,

90
0:05:07.007,000 --> 0:05:1,000
what we know so far about air pollution in our brain.

91
0:05:11.107,000 --> 0:05:15,000
First, there is an emerging body of evidence

92
0:05:15.182,000 --> 0:05:18,000
regarding the potential harmful effects

93
0:05:18.424,000 --> 0:05:19,000
of air pollutants

94
0:05:19.826,000 --> 0:05:21,000
into our central nervous system.

95
0:05:22.695,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But let's go back to the toxic particles.

96
0:05:25.073,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Remember?

97
0:05:26.248,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We left them at the lungs,

98
0:05:27.956,000 --> 0:05:28,000
enjoying life,

99
0:05:29.288,000 --> 0:05:3,000
polluting everything.

100
0:05:30.925,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But now the smallest of them,

101
0:05:32.965,000 --> 0:05:34,000
they can cross into the bloodstream,

102
0:05:35.967,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and from the bloodstream, pumped by the heart,

103
0:05:39.314,000 --> 0:05:41,000
they can reach the whole body,

104
0:05:41.515,000 --> 0:05:43,000
threatening every organ,

105
0:05:44.134,000 --> 0:05:45,000
including the brain.

106
0:05:46.697,000 --> 0:05:49,000
We used to say that air pollution has no borders,

107
0:05:49.85,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and it's true as well within our bodies,

108
0:05:52.546,000 --> 0:05:56,000
because air pollutants will cross the placental barrier

109
0:05:57.382,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and reach the fetus and alter the cerebral cortex of our children

110
0:06:03.978,000 --> 0:06:07,000
even before they take their first breath.

111
0:06:09.178,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Second, several studies have suggested

112
0:06:13.341,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that both prenatal and early childhood long-term exposure to air pollution

113
0:06:20.837,000 --> 0:06:25,000
will have a negative influence on neural development,

114
0:06:26.582,000 --> 0:06:3,000
will have lower cognitive test outcomes,

115
0:06:30.908,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and there will be an influence as well, a negative influence,

116
0:06:34.254,000 --> 0:06:38,000
on some behavioral disorders like autism

117
0:06:38.943,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

118
0:06:44.629,000 --> 0:06:46,000
In addition to that, some evidence found

119
0:06:47.395,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that exposing our children's and young adults' brains

120
0:06:52.215,000 --> 0:06:54,000
for a long time to particulate matter

121
0:06:55.056,000 --> 0:07:,000
will cause some reactions like brain inflammation,

122
0:07:00.366,000 --> 0:07:02,000
altering the neural response

123
0:07:02.942,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and [also] leading to the influence of more protein plaques

124
0:07:09.936,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that are accumulating,

125
0:07:11.547,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and those can increase the risks for diseases

126
0:07:14.754,000 --> 0:07:16,000
like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

127
0:07:18.441,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Ironic, isn't it:

128
0:07:19.868,000 --> 0:07:23,000
we are investing in our children's future,

129
0:07:24.511,000 --> 0:07:28,000
we are sending them to school every day to expand their minds,

130
0:07:28.97,000 --> 0:07:3,000
the society is investing in their education,

131
0:07:31.963,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and yet the air they breathe while waiting for the school bus

132
0:07:37.418,000 --> 0:07:41,000
is influencing negatively the development of their brain.

133
0:07:43.334,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Let's go to the third: What about adults?

134
0:07:46.863,000 --> 0:07:49,000
According to recent scientific evidence,

135
0:07:51.376,000 --> 0:07:57,000
long-term exposure to particulate matter will cause a cognitive decline

136
0:07:58.37,000 --> 0:08:01,000
in study participants as they age.

137
0:08:01.545,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And not only that,

138
0:08:02.788,000 --> 0:08:07,000
if you expose them to long-term, very fine particulate matter,

139
0:08:08.184,000 --> 0:08:11,000
their brain will age more rapidly,

140
0:08:11.606,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and they will have higher odds

141
0:08:14.606,000 --> 0:08:18,000
of having small, silent strokes.

142
0:08:20.326,000 --> 0:08:22,000
The last one -- and I will not give you more evidence,

143
0:08:22.889,000 --> 0:08:23,000
because there is a ton of [it] --

144
0:08:24.891,000 --> 0:08:27,000
some epidemiological studies in animal models

145
0:08:28.261,000 --> 0:08:33,000
have suggested that there might be an increased risk of dementia

146
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
with sustained exposure to air pollutants.

147
0:08:37.703,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So, almost everybody is exposed to air pollution.

148
0:08:43.114,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Whether you live in a rural area or an urban area,

149
0:08:47.127,000 --> 0:08:51,000
whether you live in a high-income country or a low-income country,

150
0:08:51.474,000 --> 0:08:54,000
everybody's brains, including yours,

151
0:08:54.803,000 --> 0:08:55,000
are at risk.

152
0:08:56.659,000 --> 0:08:57,000
As a medical doctor,

153
0:08:58.403,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I have been dedicating the last more than 20 years now

154
0:09:03.442,000 --> 0:09:04,000
of my professional life

155
0:09:05.232,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to raise awareness about public health issues,

156
0:09:09.367,000 --> 0:09:1,000
public health risks,

157
0:09:10.828,000 --> 0:09:11,000
at the World Health Organization,

158
0:09:12.506,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and I know that the knowledge is there and the solutions as well.

159
0:09:17.483,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Sure, some places are more polluted than others,

160
0:09:21.404,000 --> 0:09:23,000
but this a global issue,

161
0:09:23.729,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and no individual, no city, no group, no country, no region

162
0:09:30.75,000 --> 0:09:32,000
will be able to solve it alone.

163
0:09:34.549,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We need very strong commitments and very strong action by everyone:

164
0:09:39.02,000 --> 0:09:41,000
civil society,

165
0:09:41.418,000 --> 0:09:42,000
private sector,

166
0:09:42.925,000 --> 0:09:43,000
even individuals.

167
0:09:44.218,000 --> 0:09:45,000
We all have a role to play.

168
0:09:46.186,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Yes, we need to influence the way we consume,

169
0:09:50.208,000 --> 0:09:51,000
the way we commute,

170
0:09:51.865,000 --> 0:09:53,000
the way we use our energy.

171
0:09:55.143,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And the good thing is that all of those solutions are available.

172
0:09:59.83,000 --> 0:10:03,000
The question is, if we postpone action by one day,

173
0:10:04.052,000 --> 0:10:07,000
there might be thousands of lives that we will lose,

174
0:10:07.453,000 --> 0:10:09,000
but if we postpone it by one year,

175
0:10:10.197,000 --> 0:10:13,000
we might be losing again seven million.

176
0:10:14.762,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So every policy maker, every politician,

177
0:10:19.319,000 --> 0:10:23,000
needs to be aware of the consequences on human health

178
0:10:23.747,000 --> 0:10:25,000
of postponing their decisions.

179
0:10:26.431,000 --> 0:10:27,000
In fact,

180
0:10:27.781,000 --> 0:10:29,000
this is not the first time in history

181
0:10:29.931,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that we are confronted with the risks of this invisible killer.

182
0:10:35.401,000 --> 0:10:38,000
This was London in 1952,

183
0:10:38.536,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and as was done in London in the '50s and the '60s,

184
0:10:44.774,000 --> 0:10:46,000
governments and cities,

185
0:10:47.59,000 --> 0:10:53,000
they need to take urgent action to stop the terrible impact of air pollution.

186
0:10:54.816,000 --> 0:11:,000
Every politician must know that delaying what they call the tough actions,

187
0:11:01.002,000 --> 0:11:07,000
like reducing traffic in cities or investing in public transport

188
0:11:07.861,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and engaging in promoting cycling in cities,

189
0:11:12.888,000 --> 0:11:14,000
investing in renewable energy,

190
0:11:15.248,000 --> 0:11:2,000
promoting cleaner energy for cooking, cooling

191
0:11:20.64,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and transportation and heating

192
0:11:23.588,000 --> 0:11:26,000
are solutions that are very smart,

193
0:11:27.196,000 --> 0:11:3,000
because, in fact, they reduce emissions,

194
0:11:31.069,000 --> 0:11:35,000
they improve air quality in line with WHO standards,

195
0:11:35.373,000 --> 0:11:38,000
which are the standards that will protect ourselves.

196
0:11:39.687,000 --> 0:11:45,000
So in fact, all politicians that we need these very strong political commitments

197
0:11:46.681,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and political will from,

198
0:11:48.594,000 --> 0:11:49,000
but [we need] all of them now.

199
0:11:50.387,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Those who fail, who postpone action,

200
0:11:55.857,000 --> 0:12:,000
they have been requested even to defend their position in court.

201
0:12:01.452,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And from now on,

202
0:12:02.996,000 --> 0:12:06,000
no politician will be able to say, "I didn't know."

203
0:12:07.897,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So the question here is:

204
0:12:09.503,000 --> 0:12:1,000
How many lives,

205
0:12:11.748,000 --> 0:12:13,000
loss of quality of life

206
0:12:14.499,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and losing our brain power

207
0:12:17.052,000 --> 0:12:19,000
are we ready to accept?

208
0:12:19.842,000 --> 0:12:21,000
If the answer is "none,"

209
0:12:22.335,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I will request that you,

210
0:12:24.171,000 --> 0:12:28,000
while our brains are still functioning, while we are still intelligent,

211
0:12:28.741,000 --> 0:12:32,000
please exercise your right, put pressure on your politicians

212
0:12:33.578,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and make sure that they take action to stop the sources of air pollution.

213
0:12:37.947,000 --> 0:12:4,000
This is the first thing we need to do to protect yourself

214
0:12:41.091,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and to protect our beautiful brain.

215
0:12:43.904,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Thank you very much.

216
0:12:45.921,000 --> 0:12:48,000
(Applause)

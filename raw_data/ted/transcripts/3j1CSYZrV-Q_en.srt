1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I thought I'd start with telling you or showing you the people who started [Jet Propulsion Lab].

2
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
When they were a bunch of kids,

3
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
they were kind of very imaginative, very adventurous,

4
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
as they were trying at Caltech to mix chemicals

5
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and see which one blows up more.

6
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Well, I don't recommend that you try to do that now.

7
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Naturally, they blew up a shack, and Caltech, well, then,

8
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
hey, you go to the Arroyo and really do all your tests in there.

9
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So, that's what we call our first five employees

10
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
during the tea break, you know, in here.

11
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
As I said, they were adventurous people.

12
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
As a matter of fact, one of them, who was, kind of, part of a cult

13
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
which was not too far from here on Orange Grove,

14
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and unfortunately he blew up himself because he kept mixing chemicals

15
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
and trying to figure out which ones were the best chemicals.

16
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So, that gives you a kind of flavor

17
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
of the kind of people we have there.

18
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
We try to avoid blowing ourselves up.

19
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
This one I thought I'd show you.

20
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Guess which one is a JPL employee in the heart of this crowd.

21
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I tried to come like him this morning,

22
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but as I walked out, then it was too cold,

23
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and I said, I'd better put my shirt back on.

24
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But more importantly, the reason I wanted to show this picture:

25
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
look where the other people are looking,

26
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and look where he is looking.

27
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Wherever anybody else looks, look somewhere else,

28
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and go do something different, you know, and doing that.

29
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And that's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing.

30
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And I want to tell you a quote from Ralph Emerson

31
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that one of my colleagues, you know, put on my wall in my office,

32
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and it says, "Do not go where the path may lead.

33
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Go instead where there is no path, and leave a trail."

34
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And that's my recommendation to all of you:

35
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
look what everybody is doing, what they are doing;

36
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
go do something completely different.

37
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Don't try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing,

38
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
because that doesn't get you very far.

39
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
In our early days we used to work a lot on rockets,

40
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
but we also used to have a lot of parties, you know.

41
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
As you can see, one of our parties, you know, a few years ago.

42
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But then a big difference happened about 50 years ago,

43
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
after Sputnik was launched. We launched the first American satellite,

44
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and that's the one you see on the left in there.

45
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And here we made 180 degrees change:

46
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
we changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house.

47
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And that was done over a period of a couple of years,

48
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and now we are the leading organization, you know,

49
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
exploring space on all of your behalf.

50
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But even when we did that, we had to remind ourselves,

51
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
sometimes there are setbacks.

52
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So you see, on the bottom, that rocket was supposed to go upward;

53
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
somehow it ended going sideways.

54
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So that's what we call the misguided missile.

55
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But then also, just to celebrate that,

56
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
we started an event at JPL for "Miss Guided Missile."

57
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So, we used to have a celebration every year and select --

58
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
there used to be competition and parades and so on.

59
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It's not very appropriate to do it now. Some people tell me to do it;

60
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I think, well, that's not really proper, you know, these days.

61
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
So, we do something a little bit more serious.

62
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And that's what you see in the last Rose Bowl, you know,

63
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
when we entered one of the floats.

64
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
That's more on the play side. And on the right side,

65
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that's the Rover just before we finished its testing

66
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to take it to the Cape to launch it.

67
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
These are the Rovers up here that you have on Mars now.

68
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So that kind of tells you about, kind of, the fun things,

69
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
you know, and the serious things that we try to do.

70
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But I said I'm going to show you a short clip

71
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
of one of our employees to kind of give you an idea

72
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
about some of the talent that we have.

73
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Video: Morgan Hendry: Beware of Safety is

74
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
an instrumental rock band.

75
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It branches on more the experimental side.

76
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
There's the improvisational side of jazz.

77
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
There's the heavy-hitting sound of rock.

78
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Being able to treat sound as an instrument, and be able to dig

79
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
for more abstract sounds and things to play live,

80
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
mixing electronics and acoustics.

81
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
The music's half of me, but the other half --

82
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I landed probably the best gig of all.

83
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I work for the Jet Propulsion Lab. I'm building the next Mars Rover.

84
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Some of the most brilliant engineers I know

85
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
are the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them.

86
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
You've got to do what you want to do.

87
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And anyone who tells you you can't, you don't listen to them.

88
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Maybe they're right - I doubt it.

89
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Tell them where to put it, and then just do what you want to do.

90
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I'm Morgan Hendry. I am NASA.

91
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Charles Elachi: Now, moving from the play stuff to the serious stuff,

92
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
always people ask, why do we explore?

93
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Why are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them?

94
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Well, the way I think about it is fairly simple.

95
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Somehow, 13 billion years ago there was a Big Bang, and you've heard

96
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
a little bit about, you know, the origin of the universe.

97
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But somehow what strikes everybody's imagination --

98
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
or lots of people's imagination -- somehow from that original Big Bang

99
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
we have this beautiful world that we live in today.

100
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
You look outside: you have all that beauty that you see,

101
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
all that life that you see around you,

102
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and here we have intelligent people like you and I

103
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
who are having a conversation here.

104
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
All that started from that Big Bang. So, the question is:

105
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
How did that happen? How did that evolve? How did the universe form?

106
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
How did the galaxies form? How did the planets form?

107
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Why is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved?

108
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Is that very common?

109
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Is there life on every planet that you can see around the stars?

110
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So we literally are all made out of stardust.

111
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We started from those stars; we are made of stardust.

112
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So, next time you are really depressed, look in the mirror

113
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and you can look and say, hi, I'm looking at a star here.

114
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
You can skip the dust part.

115
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But literally, we are all made of stardust.

116
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So, what we are trying to do in our exploration is effectively

117
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
write the book of how things have came about as they are today.

118
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And one of the first, or the easiest, places we can go

119
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and explore that is to go towards Mars.

120
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And the reason Mars takes particular attention:

121
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
it's not very far from us.

122
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
You know, it'll take us only six months to get there.

123
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Six to nine months at the right time of the year.

124
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It's a planet somewhat similar to Earth. It's a little bit smaller,

125
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
but the land mass on Mars is about the same

126
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
as the land mass on Earth, you know,

127
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
if you don't take the oceans into account.

128
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It has polar caps. It has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours,

129
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
so it has weather. So, it's very similar to some extent,

130
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and you can see some of the features on it,

131
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
like the Grand Canyon on Mars,

132
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
or what we call the Grand Canyon on Mars.

133
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
It is like the Grand Canyon on Earth, except a hell of a lot larger.

134
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So it's about the size, you know, of the United States.

135
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It has volcanoes on it. And that's Mount Olympus on Mars,

136
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
which is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet.

137
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And if you look at the height of it

138
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and you compare it to Mount Everest, you see, it'll give you

139
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
an idea of how large that Mount Olympus, you know, is,

140
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
relative to Mount Everest.

141
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So, it basically dwarfs, you know, Mount Everest here on Earth.

142
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
So, that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or volcanic events

143
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
which have happened on that planet.

144
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Recently from one of our satellites, this shows that it's Earth-like --

145
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
we caught a landslide occurring as it was happening.

146
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So it is a dynamic planet,

147
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and activity is going on as we speak today.

148
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And these Rovers, people wonder now, what are they doing today,

149
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
so I thought I would show you a little bit what they are doing.

150
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
This is one very large crater. Geologists love craters,

151
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
because craters are like digging a big hole in the ground

152
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
without really working at it,

153
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and you can see what's below the surface.

154
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So, this is called Victoria Crater,

155
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
which is about a few football fields in size.

156
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And if you look at the top left, you see a little teeny dark dot.

157
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
This picture was taken from an orbiting satellite.

158
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
If I zoom on it, you can see: that's the Rover on the surface.

159
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So, that was taken from orbit; we had the camera zoom on the surface,

160
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and we actually saw the Rover on the surface.

161
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And we actually used the combination of the satellite images

162
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and the Rover to actually conduct science,

163
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
because we can observe large areas

164
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
and then you can get those Rovers to move around

165
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and basically go to a certain location.

166
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So, specifically what we are doing now is

167
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that Rover is going down in that crater.

168
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
As I told you, geologists love craters.

169
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And the reason is, many of you went to the Grand Canyon,

170
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and you see in the wall of the Grand Canyon, you see these layers.

171
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And what these layers -- that's what the surface used to be

172
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
a million years ago, 10 million years ago,

173
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
100 million years ago, and you get deposits on top of them.

174
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So if you can read the layers it's like reading your book,

175
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and you can learn the history of what happened in the past

176
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
in that location.

177
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So what you are seeing here are the layers on the wall

178
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
of that crater, and the Rover is going down now, measuring, you know,

179
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
the properties and analyzing the rocks

180
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
as it's going down, you know, that canyon.

181
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Now, it's kind of a little bit of a challenge driving

182
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
down a slope like this.

183
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
If you were there you wouldn't do it yourself.

184
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
But we really made sure we tested those Rovers

185
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
before we got them down -- or that Rover --

186
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and made sure that it's all working well.

187
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
Now, when I came last time, shortly after the landing --

188
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I think it was, like, a hundred days after the landing --

189
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I told you I was surprised that those Rovers

190
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
are lasting even a hundred days.

191
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Well, here we are four years later, and they're still working.

192
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Now you say, Charles, you are really lying to us, and so on,

193
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
but that's not true. We really believed they were going to last

194
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
90 days or 100 days, because they are solar powered,

195
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and Mars is a dusty planet, so we expected the dust

196
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
would start accumulating on the surface, and after a while

197
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
we wouldn't have enough power, you know, to keep them warm.

198
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Well, I always say it's important that you are smart,

199
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
but every once in a while it's good to be lucky.

200
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And that's what we found out. It turned out that every once in a while

201
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
there are dust devils which come by on Mars, as you are seeing here,

202
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and when the dust devil comes over the Rover, it just cleans it up.

203
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
It is like a brand new car that you have,

204
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and that's literally why they have lasted so long.

205
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And now we designed them reasonably well,

206
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
but that's exactly why they are lasting that long

207
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and still providing all the science data.

208
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Now, the two Rovers, each one of them is, kind of, getting old.

209
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
You know, one of them, one of the wheels is stuck, is not working,

210
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
one of the front wheels, so what we are doing,

211
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
we are driving it backwards.

212
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint, you know,

213
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
it's not working very well, so it's walking like this,

214
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and we can move the arm, you know, that way.

215
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But still they are producing a lot of scientific data.

216
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Now, during that whole period, a number of people got excited,

217
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
you know, outside the science community about these Rovers,

218
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
so I thought I'd show you a video just to give you a reflection

219
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
about how these Rovers are being viewed by people

220
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
other than the science community.

221
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So let me go on the next short video.

222
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
By the way, this video is pretty accurate of how the landing took place, you know,

223
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
about four years ago.

224
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Video: Okay, we have parachute aligned.

225
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Okay, deploy the airbags. Open.

226
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Camera. We have a picture right now.

227
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Yeah!

228
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
CE: That's about what happened in the Houston operation room. It's exactly like this.

229
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Video: Now, if there is life, the Dutch will find it.

230
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
What is he doing?

231
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
What is that?

232
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
CE: Not too bad.

233
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So anyway, let me continue on showing you a little bit

234
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
about the beauty of that planet.

235
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
As I said earlier, it looked very much like Earth,

236
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
so you see sand dunes.

237
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
It looks like I could have told you these are pictures taken

238
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
from the Sahara Desert or somewhere, and you'd have believed me,

239
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
but these are pictures taken from Mars.

240
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
But one area which is particularly intriguing for us

241
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
is the northern region, you know, of Mars, close to the North Pole,

242
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
because we see ice caps, and we see the ice caps shrinking

243
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and expanding, so it's very much like you have in northern Canada.

244
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And we wanted to find out -- and we see all kinds of glacial features on it.

245
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So, we wanted to find out, actually,

246
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
what is that ice made of, and could that have embedded in it

247
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
some organic, you know, material.

248
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So we have a spacecraft which is heading towards Mars,

249
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
called Phoenix, and that spacecraft will land

250
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
17 days, seven hours and 20 seconds from now,

251
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
so you can adjust your watch.

252
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
So it's on May 25 around just before five o'clock our time here

253
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
on the West Coast, actually we will be landing on another planet.

254
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And as you can see, this is a picture of the spacecraft put on Mars,

255
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
but I thought that just in case you're going to miss that show, you know,

256
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
in 17 days, I'll show you, kind of,

257
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
a little bit of what's going to happen.

258
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Video: That's what we call the seven minutes of terror.

259
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
So the plan is to dig in the soil and take samples

260
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
that we put them in an oven and actually heat them

261
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and look what gases will come from it.

262
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So this was launched about nine months ago.

263
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
We'll be coming in at 12,000 miles per hour, and in seven minutes

264
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
we have to stop and touch the surface very softly

265
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
so we don't break that lander.

266
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Ben Cichy: Phoenix is the first Mars Scout mission.

267
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
It's the first mission that's going to try to land

268
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
near the North Pole of Mars, and it's the first mission

269
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that's actually going to try and reach out and touch water

270
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
on the surface of another planet.

271
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Lynn Craig: Where there tends to be water, at least on Earth,

272
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
there tends to be life, and so it's potentially a place

273
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
where life could have existed on the planet in the past.

274
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Erik Bailey: The main purpose of EDL is to take a spacecraft that is traveling

275
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
at 12,500 miles an hour and bring it to a screeching halt

276
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
in a soft way in a very short amount of time.

277
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
BC: We enter the Martian atmosphere.

278
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
We're 70 miles above the surface of Mars.

279
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And our lander is safely tucked inside what we call an aeroshell.

280
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
EB: Looks kind of like an ice cream cone, more or less.

281
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
BC: And on the front of it is this heat shield,

282
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
this saucer-looking thing that has about a half-inch

283
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
of essentially what's cork on the front of it,

284
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
which is our heat shield.

285
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Now, this is really special cork,

286
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and this cork is what's going to protect us

287
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
from the violent atmospheric entry that we're about to experience.

288
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Rob Grover: Friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft,

289
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and we use the friction when it's flying through the atmosphere

290
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
to our advantage to slow us down.

291
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
BC: From this point, we're going to decelerate from 12,500 miles an hour

292
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
down to 900 miles an hour.

293
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
EB: The outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the Sun.

294
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
RG: The temperature of the heat shield can reach 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit.

295
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
EB: The inside doesn't get very hot.

296
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
It probably gets about room temperature.

297
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Richard Kornfeld: There is this window of opportunity

298
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
within which we can deploy the parachute.

299
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
EB: If you fire the 'chute too early, the parachute itself could fail.

300
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
The fabric and the stitching could just pull apart.

301
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And that would be bad.

302
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
BC: In the first 15 seconds after we deploy the parachute,

303
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
we'll decelerate from 900 miles an hour

304
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
to a relatively slow 250 miles an hour.

305
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
We no longer need the heat shield to protect us

306
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
from the force of atmospheric entry, so we jettison the heat shield,

307
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of Mars.

308
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
LC: After the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed,

309
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect

310
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
how far Phoenix really is from the ground.

311
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
BC: We've lost 99 percent of our entry velocity.

312
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
So, we're 99 percent of the way to where we want to be.

313
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
But that last one percent, as it always seems to be, is the tricky part.

314
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
EB: Now the spacecraft actually has to decide

315
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
when it's going to get rid of its parachute.

316
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
BC: We separate from the lander going 125 miles an hour

317
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
at roughly a kilometer above the surface of Mars: 3,200 feet.

318
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
That's like taking two Empire State Buildings

319
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and stacking them on top of one another.

320
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
EB: That's when we separate from the back shell,

321
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and we're now in free-fall.

322
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
It's a very scary moment; a lot has to happen

323
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
in a very short amount of time.

324
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
LC: So it's in a free-fall,

325
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
but it's also trying to use all of its actuators

326
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
to make sure that it's in the right position to land.

327
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
EB: And then it has to light up its engines, right itself,

328
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely.

329
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
BC: Earth and Mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes

330
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
for a signal from Mars to get to Earth.

331
0:16:59.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
And EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes.

332
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
So by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started

333
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
it'll already be over.

334
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
EB: We have to build large amounts of autonomy into the spacecraft

335
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
so that it can land itself safely.

336
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
BC: EDL is this immense, technically challenging problem.

337
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
It's about getting a spacecraft that's hurtling through deep space

338
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
and using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out

339
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
how to get it down to the surface of Mars at zero miles an hour.

340
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
It's this immensely exciting and challenging problem.

341
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
CE: Hopefully it all will happen the way you saw it in here.

342
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:39,000
So it will be a very tense moment, you know,

343
0:17:39.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
as we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet.

344
0:17:43.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
So now let me talk about the next things that we are doing.

345
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
So we are in the process, as we speak, of actually designing

346
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
the next Rover that we are going to be sending to Mars.

347
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
So I thought I would go a little bit and tell you, kind of,

348
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
the steps we go through.

349
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
It's very similar to what you do when you design your product.

350
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:17:59,000
As you saw a little bit earlier,

351
0:17:59.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
when we were doing the Phoenix one,

352
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
we have to take into account the heat that we are going to be facing.

353
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:05,000
So we have to study all kinds of different materials,

354
0:18:05.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
the shape that we want to do.

355
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:09,000
In general we don't try to please the customer here.

356
0:18:09.16,000 --> 0:18:12,000
What we want to do is to make sure we have an effective, you know,

357
0:18:12.16,000 --> 0:18:14,000
an efficient kind of machine.

358
0:18:14.16,000 --> 0:18:16,000
First we start by we want to have our employees

359
0:18:16.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
to be as imaginative as they can.

360
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
And we really love being close to the art center, because we have,

361
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
as a matter of fact, one of the alumni from the art center,

362
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Eric Nyquist, had put a series of displays,

363
0:18:26.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
far-out displays, you know,

364
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:31,000
in our what we call mission design or spacecraft design room,

365
0:18:31.16,000 --> 0:18:33,000
just to get people to think wildly about things.

366
0:18:33.16,000 --> 0:18:36,000
We have a bunch of Legos. So, as I said,

367
0:18:36.16,000 --> 0:18:39,000
this is a playground for adults, where they sit down and try to play

368
0:18:39.16,000 --> 0:18:43,000
with different shapes and different designs.

369
0:18:43.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
Then we get a little bit more serious, so we have

370
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:49,000
what we call our CAD/CAMs and all the engineers who are involved,

371
0:18:49.16,000 --> 0:18:52,000
or scientists who are involved, who know about thermal properties,

372
0:18:52.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
know about design, know about atmospheric interaction, parachutes,

373
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:58,000
all of these things, which they work in a team effort

374
0:18:58.16,000 --> 0:19:02,000
and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent,

375
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:05,000
so to see, does that meet the requirement that we need.

376
0:19:05.16,000 --> 0:19:07,000
On the right, also, we have to take into account

377
0:19:07.16,000 --> 0:19:09,000
the environment of the planet where we are going.

378
0:19:09.16,000 --> 0:19:12,000
If you are going to Jupiter, you have a very high-radiation,

379
0:19:12.16,000 --> 0:19:14,000
you know, environment. It's about the same radiation environment

380
0:19:14.16,000 --> 0:19:17,000
close by Jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor.

381
0:19:17.16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
So just imagine: you take your P.C. and throw it into a nuclear reactor

382
0:19:20.16,000 --> 0:19:22,000
and it still has to work.

383
0:19:22.16,000 --> 0:19:24,000
So these are kind of some of the little challenges, you know,

384
0:19:24.16,000 --> 0:19:27,000
that we have to face.

385
0:19:27.16,000 --> 0:19:29,000
If we are doing entry, we have to do tests of parachutes.

386
0:19:29.16,000 --> 0:19:32,000
You saw in the video a parachute breaking. That would be a bad day,

387
0:19:32.16,000 --> 0:19:35,000
you know, if that happened, so we have to test,

388
0:19:35.16,000 --> 0:19:38,000
because we are deploying this parachute at supersonic speeds.

389
0:19:38.16,000 --> 0:19:41,000
We are coming at extremely high speeds, and we are deploying them

390
0:19:41.16,000 --> 0:19:43,000
to slow us down. So we have to do all kinds of tests.

391
0:19:43.16,000 --> 0:19:46,000
To give you an idea of the size, you know, of that parachute

392
0:19:46.16,000 --> 0:19:48,000
relative to the people standing there.

393
0:19:48.16,000 --> 0:19:52,000
Next step, we go and actually build some kind of test models

394
0:19:52.16,000 --> 0:19:55,000
and actually test them, you know, in the lab at JPL,

395
0:19:55.16,000 --> 0:19:57,000
in what we call our Mars Yard.

396
0:19:57.16,000 --> 0:19:59,000
We kick them, we hit them, we drop them,

397
0:19:59.16,000 --> 0:20:03,000
just to make sure we understand how, where would they break.

398
0:20:03.16,000 --> 0:20:09,000
And then we back off, you know, from that point.

399
0:20:09.16,000 --> 0:20:13,000
And then we actually do the actual building and the flight.

400
0:20:13.16,000 --> 0:20:17,000
And this next Rover that we're flying is about the size of a car.

401
0:20:17.16,000 --> 0:20:19,000
That big shield that you see outside,

402
0:20:19.16,000 --> 0:20:21,000
that's a heat shield which is going to protect it.

403
0:20:21.16,000 --> 0:20:24,000
And that will be basically built over the next year,

404
0:20:24.16,000 --> 0:20:27,000
and it will be launched June a year from now.

405
0:20:27.16,000 --> 0:20:3,000
Now, in that case, because it was a very big Rover,

406
0:20:30.16,000 --> 0:20:32,000
we couldn't use airbags.

407
0:20:32.16,000 --> 0:20:34,000
And I know many of you, kind of, last time afterwards said

408
0:20:34.16,000 --> 0:20:37,000
well, that was a cool thing to have -- those airbags.

409
0:20:37.16,000 --> 0:20:4,000
Unfortunately this Rover is, like, ten times the size of the, you know,

410
0:20:40.16,000 --> 0:20:43,000
mass-wise, of the other Rover, or three times the mass.

411
0:20:43.16,000 --> 0:20:45,000
So we can't use airbags. So we have to come up with

412
0:20:45.16,000 --> 0:20:47,000
another ingenious idea of how do we land it.

413
0:20:47.16,000 --> 0:20:51,000
And we didn't want to take it propulsively all the way to the surface

414
0:20:51.16,000 --> 0:20:53,000
because we didn't want to contaminate the surface;

415
0:20:53.16,000 --> 0:20:56,000
we wanted the Rover to immediately land on its legs.

416
0:20:56.16,000 --> 0:20:58,000
So we came up with this ingenious idea,

417
0:20:58.16,000 --> 0:21:02,000
which is used here on Earth for helicopters.

418
0:21:02.16,000 --> 0:21:06,000
Actually, the lander will come down to about 100 feet and hover

419
0:21:06.16,000 --> 0:21:09,000
above that surface for 100 feet, and then we have a sky crane

420
0:21:09.16,000 --> 0:21:11,000
which will take that Rover and land it down on the surface.

421
0:21:11.16,000 --> 0:21:14,000
Hopefully it all will work, you know, it will work that way.

422
0:21:14.16,000 --> 0:21:17,000
And that Rover will be more kind of like a chemist.

423
0:21:17.16,000 --> 0:21:2,000
What we are going to be doing with that Rover as it drives around,

424
0:21:20.16,000 --> 0:21:23,000
it's going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks.

425
0:21:23.16,000 --> 0:21:26,000
So it will have an arm which will take samples,

426
0:21:26.16,000 --> 0:21:28,000
put them in an oven, crush and analyze them.

427
0:21:28.16,000 --> 0:21:31,000
But also, if there is something that we cannot reach

428
0:21:31.16,000 --> 0:21:34,000
because it is too high on a cliff, we have a little laser system

429
0:21:34.16,000 --> 0:21:37,000
which will actually zap the rock, evaporate some of it,

430
0:21:37.16,000 --> 0:21:39,000
and actually analyze what's coming from that rock.

431
0:21:39.16,000 --> 0:21:42,000
So it's a little bit like "Star Wars," you know, but it's real.

432
0:21:42.16,000 --> 0:21:44,000
It's real stuff.

433
0:21:44.16,000 --> 0:21:46,000
And also to help you, to help the community

434
0:21:46.16,000 --> 0:21:5,000
so you can do ads on that Rover, we are going to train that Rover

435
0:21:50.16,000 --> 0:21:53,000
to actually in addition to do this, to actually serve cocktails,

436
0:21:53.16,000 --> 0:21:55,000
you know, also on Mars.

437
0:21:55.16,000 --> 0:21:58,000
So that's kind of giving you an idea of the kind of, you know,

438
0:21:58.16,000 --> 0:21:59,000
fun things we are doing on Mars.

439
0:21:59.16,000 --> 0:22:02,000
I thought I'd go to "The Lord of the Rings" now

440
0:22:02.16,000 --> 0:22:04,000
and show you some of the things we have there.

441
0:22:04.16,000 --> 0:22:07,000
Now, "The Lord of the Rings" has two things played through it.

442
0:22:07.16,000 --> 0:22:1,000
One, it's a very attractive planet --

443
0:22:10.16,000 --> 0:22:12,000
it just has the beauty of the rings and so on.

444
0:22:12.16,000 --> 0:22:15,000
But for scientists, also the rings have a special meaning,

445
0:22:15.16,000 --> 0:22:18,000
because we believe they represent, on a small scale,

446
0:22:18.16,000 --> 0:22:21,000
how the Solar System actually formed.

447
0:22:21.16,000 --> 0:22:25,000
Some of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed,

448
0:22:25.16,000 --> 0:22:29,000
that the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun,

449
0:22:29.16,000 --> 0:22:31,000
a lot of the dust around it created rings

450
0:22:31.16,000 --> 0:22:34,000
and then the particles in those rings accumulated together,

451
0:22:34.16,000 --> 0:22:37,000
and they formed bigger rocks, and then that's how the planets,

452
0:22:37.16,000 --> 0:22:38,000
you know, were formed.

453
0:22:38.16,000 --> 0:22:41,000
So, the idea is, by watching Saturn we're actually watching

454
0:22:41.16,000 --> 0:22:44,000
our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale,

455
0:22:44.16,000 --> 0:22:46,000
so it's like a test bed for it.

456
0:22:46.16,000 --> 0:22:48,000
So, let me show you a little bit

457
0:22:48.16,000 --> 0:22:51,000
on what that Saturnian system looks like.

458
0:22:51.16,000 --> 0:22:54,000
First, I'm going to fly you over the rings.

459
0:22:54.16,000 --> 0:22:56,000
By the way, all of this is real stuff.

460
0:22:56.16,000 --> 0:22:58,000
This is not animation or anything like this.

461
0:22:58.16,000 --> 0:23:,000
This is actually taken from the satellite

462
0:23:00.16,000 --> 0:23:03,000
that we have in orbit around Saturn, the Cassini.

463
0:23:03.16,000 --> 0:23:06,000
And you see the amount of detail that is in those rings,

464
0:23:06.16,000 --> 0:23:07,000
which are the particles.

465
0:23:07.16,000 --> 0:23:1,000
Some of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles.

466
0:23:10.16,000 --> 0:23:14,000
So that's why you have these gaps, is because a small satellite, you know,

467
0:23:14.16,000 --> 0:23:17,000
is being formed in that location.

468
0:23:17.16,000 --> 0:23:19,000
Now, you think that those rings are very large objects.

469
0:23:19.16,000 --> 0:23:21,000
Yes, they are very large in one dimension;

470
0:23:21.16,000 --> 0:23:24,000
in the other dimension they are paper thin. Very, very thin.

471
0:23:24.16,000 --> 0:23:28,000
What you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on Saturn itself.

472
0:23:28.16,000 --> 0:23:29,000
And that's one of the satellites

473
0:23:29.16,000 --> 0:23:32,000
which was actually formed on that one.

474
0:23:32.16,000 --> 0:23:34,000
So, think about it as a paper-thin,

475
0:23:34.16,000 --> 0:23:39,000
huge area of many hundreds of thousands of miles, which is rotating.

476
0:23:39.16,000 --> 0:23:42,000
And we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form,

477
0:23:42.16,000 --> 0:23:45,000
each one looking very different and very odd, and that keeps

478
0:23:45.16,000 --> 0:23:48,000
scientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this,

479
0:23:48.16,000 --> 0:23:51,000
and telling NASA we need more money so we can explain

480
0:23:51.16,000 --> 0:23:53,000
what these things look like, or why they formed that way.

481
0:23:53.16,000 --> 0:23:56,000
Well, there were two satellites which were particularly interesting.

482
0:23:56.16,000 --> 0:23:58,000
One of them is called Enceladus.

483
0:23:58.16,000 --> 0:24:01,000
It's a satellite which was all made of ice,

484
0:24:01.16,000 --> 0:24:03,000
and we measured it from orbit. Made of ice.

485
0:24:03.16,000 --> 0:24:05,000
But there was something bizarre about it.

486
0:24:05.16,000 --> 0:24:09,000
If you look at these stripes in here, what we call tiger stripes,

487
0:24:09.16,000 --> 0:24:11,000
when we flew over them, all of a sudden we saw

488
0:24:11.16,000 --> 0:24:14,000
an increase in the temperature, which said that those stripes

489
0:24:14.16,000 --> 0:24:16,000
are warmer than the rest of the planet.

490
0:24:16.16,000 --> 0:24:21,000
So as we flew by away from it, we looked back. And guess what?

491
0:24:21.16,000 --> 0:24:23,000
We saw geysers coming out.

492
0:24:23.16,000 --> 0:24:25,000
So this is a Yellowstone, you know, of Saturn.

493
0:24:25.16,000 --> 0:24:29,000
We are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet,

494
0:24:29.16,000 --> 0:24:31,000
which indicate that most likely there is an ocean, you know,

495
0:24:31.16,000 --> 0:24:33,000
below the surface.

496
0:24:33.16,000 --> 0:24:36,000
And somehow, through some dynamic effect, we're having these geysers

497
0:24:36.16,000 --> 0:24:39,000
which are being, you know, emitted from it.

498
0:24:39.16,000 --> 0:24:41,000
And the reason I showed the little arrow there,

499
0:24:41.16,000 --> 0:24:43,000
I think that should say 30 miles,

500
0:24:43.16,000 --> 0:24:46,000
we decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft

501
0:24:46.16,000 --> 0:24:48,000
through the plume of that geyser

502
0:24:48.16,000 --> 0:24:53,000
so we can actually measure the material that it is made of.

503
0:24:53.16,000 --> 0:24:56,000
That was [unclear] also -- you know, because we were worried

504
0:24:56.16,000 --> 0:24:58,000
about the risk of it, but it worked pretty well.

505
0:24:58.16,000 --> 0:25:01,000
We flew at the top of it, and we found that there is a fair amount of

506
0:25:01.16,000 --> 0:25:05,000
organic material which is being emitted in combination with the ice.

507
0:25:05.16,000 --> 0:25:09,000
And over the next few years, as we keep orbiting, you know, Saturn,

508
0:25:09.16,000 --> 0:25:12,000
we are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface

509
0:25:12.16,000 --> 0:25:14,000
and make more accurate measurements.

510
0:25:14.16,000 --> 0:25:16,000
Now, another satellite also attracted a lot of attention,

511
0:25:16.16,000 --> 0:25:19,000
and that's Titan. And the reason Titan is particularly interesting,

512
0:25:19.16,000 --> 0:25:24,000
it's a satellite bigger than our moon, and it has an atmosphere.

513
0:25:24.16,000 --> 0:25:27,000
And that atmosphere is very -- as dense as our own atmosphere.

514
0:25:27.16,000 --> 0:25:3,000
So if you were on Titan, you would feel the same pressure

515
0:25:30.16,000 --> 0:25:34,000
that you feel in here. Except it's a lot colder,

516
0:25:34.16,000 --> 0:25:37,000
and that atmosphere is heavily made of methane.

517
0:25:37.16,000 --> 0:25:4,000
Now, methane gets people all excited, because it's organic material,

518
0:25:40.16,000 --> 0:25:42,000
so immediately people start thinking,

519
0:25:42.16,000 --> 0:25:45,000
could life have evolved in that location,

520
0:25:45.16,000 --> 0:25:47,000
when you have a lot of organic material.

521
0:25:47.16,000 --> 0:25:51,000
So people believe now that Titan is most likely what we call

522
0:25:51.16,000 --> 0:25:57,000
a pre-biotic planet, because it's so cold organic material did not get

523
0:25:57.16,000 --> 0:25:59,000
to the stage of becoming biological material,

524
0:25:59.16,000 --> 0:26:01,000
and therefore life could have evolved on it.

525
0:26:01.16,000 --> 0:26:05,000
So it could be Earth, frozen three billion years ago

526
0:26:05.16,000 --> 0:26:07,000
before life actually started on it.

527
0:26:07.16,000 --> 0:26:1,000
So that's getting a lot of interest, and to show you some example

528
0:26:10.16,000 --> 0:26:14,000
of what we did in there, we actually dropped a probe,

529
0:26:14.16,000 --> 0:26:16,000
which was developed by our colleagues in Europe, we dropped a probe

530
0:26:16.16,000 --> 0:26:19,000
as we were orbiting Saturn.

531
0:26:19.16,000 --> 0:26:21,000
We dropped a probe in the atmosphere of Titan.

532
0:26:21.16,000 --> 0:26:24,000
And this is a picture of an area as we were coming down.

533
0:26:24.16,000 --> 0:26:26,000
Just looked like the coast of California for me.

534
0:26:26.16,000 --> 0:26:29,000
You see the rivers which are coming along the coast,

535
0:26:29.16,000 --> 0:26:31,000
and you see that white area which looks like Catalina Island,

536
0:26:31.16,000 --> 0:26:33,000
and that looks like an ocean.

537
0:26:33.16,000 --> 0:26:36,000
And then with an instrument we have on board, a radar instrument,

538
0:26:36.16,000 --> 0:26:39,000
we found there are lakes like the Great Lakes in here,

539
0:26:39.16,000 --> 0:26:4,000
so it looks very much like Earth.

540
0:26:40.16,000 --> 0:26:44,000
It looks like there are rivers on it, there are oceans or lakes,

541
0:26:44.16,000 --> 0:26:47,000
we know there are clouds. We think it's raining also on it.

542
0:26:47.16,000 --> 0:26:49,000
So it's very much like the cycle on Earth except

543
0:26:49.16,000 --> 0:26:52,000
because it's so cold, it could not be water, you know,

544
0:26:52.16,000 --> 0:26:54,000
because water would have frozen.

545
0:26:54.16,000 --> 0:26:56,000
What it turned out, that all that we are seeing, all this liquid,

546
0:26:56.16,000 --> 0:26:59,000
[is made of] hydrocarbon and ethane and methane,

547
0:26:59.16,000 --> 0:27:01,000
similar to what you put in your car.

548
0:27:01.16,000 --> 0:27:05,000
So here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our Earth,

549
0:27:05.16,000 --> 0:27:09,000
but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material.

550
0:27:09.16,000 --> 0:27:12,000
So if you were on Mars -- sorry, on Titan,

551
0:27:12.16,000 --> 0:27:14,000
you don't have to worry about four-dollar gasoline.

552
0:27:14.16,000 --> 0:27:16,000
You just drive to the nearest lake, stick your hose in it,

553
0:27:16.16,000 --> 0:27:19,000
and you've got your car filled up.

554
0:27:19.16,000 --> 0:27:21,000
On the other hand, if you light a match

555
0:27:21.16,000 --> 0:27:25,000
the whole planet will blow up.

556
0:27:25.16,000 --> 0:27:28,000
So in closing, I said I want to close by a couple of pictures.

557
0:27:28.16,000 --> 0:27:31,000
And just to kind of put us in perspective,

558
0:27:31.16,000 --> 0:27:34,000
this is a picture of Saturn taken with a spacecraft

559
0:27:34.16,000 --> 0:27:36,000
from behind Saturn, looking towards the Sun.

560
0:27:36.16,000 --> 0:27:4,000
The Sun is behind Saturn, so we see what we call "forward scattering,"

561
0:27:40.16,000 --> 0:27:43,000
so it highlights all the rings. And I'm going to zoom.

562
0:27:43.16,000 --> 0:27:46,000
There is a -- I'm not sure you can see it very well,

563
0:27:46.16,000 --> 0:27:48,000
but on the top left, around 10 o'clock,

564
0:27:48.16,000 --> 0:27:51,000
there is a little teeny dot, and that's Earth.

565
0:27:51.16,000 --> 0:27:55,000
You barely can see ourselves. So what I did, I thought I'd zoom on it.

566
0:27:55.16,000 --> 0:27:59,000
So as you zoom in, you know, you can see Earth, you know,

567
0:27:59.16,000 --> 0:28:02,000
just in the middle here. So we zoomed all the way on the art center.

568
0:28:06.16,000 --> 0:28:08,000
So thank you very much.

1
0:00:15.513,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I am a cultural omnivore,

2
0:00:17.467,000 --> 0:00:21,000
one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an iPod --

3
0:00:22.127,000 --> 0:00:24,000
an iPod that contains Wagner and Mozart,

4
0:00:24.38,000 --> 0:00:26,000
pop diva Christina Aguilera,

5
0:00:26.42,000 --> 0:00:27,000
country singer Josh Turner,

6
0:00:28.06,000 --> 0:00:3,000
gangsta rap artist Kirk Franklin,

7
0:00:30.519,000 --> 0:00:32,000
concerti, symphonies and more and more.

8
0:00:32.916,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I'm a voracious reader,

9
0:00:34.454,000 --> 0:00:36,000
a reader who deals with Ian McEwan down to Stephanie Meyer.

10
0:00:37.409,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I have read the Twilight tetralogy.

11
0:00:40.638,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And one who lives for my home theater,

12
0:00:43.08,000 --> 0:00:45,000
a home theater where I devour DVDs, video on demand

13
0:00:46.083,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and a lot of television.

14
0:00:47.497,000 --> 0:00:5,000
For me, "Law & Order: SVU," Tina Fey and "30 Rock"

15
0:00:50.902,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and "Judge Judy" --

16
0:00:52.498,000 --> 0:00:55,000
"The people are real, the cases are real, the rulings are final."

17
0:00:55.919,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:56.955,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Now, I'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions,

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
especially my passion for "Judge Judy,"

20
0:01:02.571,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and you'd fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us,

21
0:01:06.085,000 --> 0:01:09,000
but I'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life,

22
0:01:09.849,000 --> 0:01:11,000
a passion for the live professional performing arts,

23
0:01:12.586,000 --> 0:01:14,000
performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire, yes,

24
0:01:15.592,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but jazz as well, modern dance, opera,

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
theater and more and more and more.

26
0:01:21.108,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Frankly, it's a sector that many of us who work in the field

27
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology.

28
0:01:28.009,000 --> 0:01:32,000
While we initially heralded the Internet as the fantastic new marketing device

29
0:01:32.423,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that was going to solve all our problems,

30
0:01:34.666,000 --> 0:01:36,000
we now realize that the Internet is, if anything,

31
0:01:37.087,000 --> 0:01:38,000
too effective in that regard.

32
0:01:38.73,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Depending on who you read, an arts organization

33
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
or an artist, who tries to attract the attention

34
0:01:43.75,000 --> 0:01:45,000
of a potential single ticket buyer,

35
0:01:45.995,000 --> 0:01:5,000
now competes with between three and 5,000 different marketing messages

36
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
a typical citizen sees every single day.

37
0:01:54.52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We now know, in fact,

38
0:01:56.261,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time.

39
0:01:59.052,000 --> 0:02:,000
Five years ago,

40
0:02:00.327,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Gen Xers spent 20.7 hours online and TV, the majority on TV.

41
0:02:05.06,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Gen Yers spent even more --

42
0:02:06.919,000 --> 0:02:08,000
23.8 hours, the majority online.

43
0:02:09.886,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And now, a typical university-entering student arrives at college

44
0:02:15.545,000 --> 0:02:19,000
already having spent 20,000 hours online

45
0:02:19.88,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and an additional 10,000 hours playing video games --

46
0:02:23.716,000 --> 0:02:26,000
a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context

47
0:02:26.958,000 --> 0:02:3,000
where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined.

48
0:02:33.165,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Moreover, we're afraid that technology

49
0:02:35.944,000 --> 0:02:38,000
has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption.

50
0:02:39.007,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Thanks to the Internet,

51
0:02:40.195,000 --> 0:02:42,000
we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it,

52
0:02:43.193,000 --> 0:02:44,000
delivered to our own doorstep.

53
0:02:45.036,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We can shop at three in the morning or eight at night,

54
0:02:47.604,000 --> 0:02:49,000
ordering jeans tailor-made for our unique body types.

55
0:02:50.561,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Expectations of personalization and customization

56
0:02:54.511,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that the live performing arts --

57
0:02:56.384,000 --> 0:02:58,000
which have set curtain times, set venues,

58
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
attendant inconveniences of travel, parking and the like --

59
0:03:02.658,000 --> 0:03:03,000
simply cannot meet.

60
0:03:04.885,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And we're all acutely aware:

61
0:03:06.55,000 --> 0:03:07,000
what's it going to mean in the future

62
0:03:08.369,000 --> 0:03:1,000
when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars

63
0:03:10.569,000 --> 0:03:12,000
for a symphony, opera or ballet ticket,

64
0:03:13.061,000 --> 0:03:16,000
when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet

65
0:03:16.397,000 --> 0:03:19,000
24 hours a day for 99 cents a song or for free?

66
0:03:22.662,000 --> 0:03:26,000
These are enormous questions for those of us that work in this terrain.

67
0:03:26.725,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But as particular as they feel to us, we know we're not alone.

68
0:03:30.417,000 --> 0:03:31,000
All of us are engaged

69
0:03:31.815,000 --> 0:03:35,000
in a seismic, fundamental realignment of culture and communications,

70
0:03:36.503,000 --> 0:03:39,000
a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry,

71
0:03:40.291,000 --> 0:03:44,000
the magazine industry, the book and publishing industry and more.

72
0:03:44.97,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Saddled in the performing arts as we are, by antiquated union agreements

73
0:03:48.856,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming,

74
0:03:53.868,000 --> 0:03:56,000
locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify

75
0:03:57.736,000 --> 0:04:,000
the ideal relationship between artist and audience

76
0:04:01.107,000 --> 0:04:03,000
most appropriate to the 19th century

77
0:04:03.416,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues,

78
0:04:06.617,000 --> 0:04:08,000
where we charge exorbitant prices.

79
0:04:09.097,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records

80
0:04:12.526,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and ask ourselves, "Are we next?"

81
0:04:16.394,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Everyone I talk to in performing arts resonates to the words of Adrienne Rich,

82
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
who, in "Dreams of a Common Language," wrote,

83
0:04:23.458,000 --> 0:04:26,000
"We are out in a country that has no language, no laws.

84
0:04:27.17,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Whatever we do together is pure invention.

85
0:04:29.732,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The maps they gave us are out of date by years."

86
0:04:35.464,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And for those of you who love the arts,

87
0:04:37.393,000 --> 0:04:39,000
aren't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day?

88
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Applause)

90
0:04:43.726,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Now, rather than saying that we're on the brink of our own annihilation,

91
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation,

92
0:04:50.93,000 --> 0:04:53,000
a reformation like the religious Reformation of the 16th century.

93
0:04:55.166,000 --> 0:04:58,000
The arts reformation, like the religious Reformation,

94
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
is spurred in part by technology,

95
0:04:59.934,000 --> 0:05:01,000
with indeed, the printing press really leading the charge

96
0:05:02.695,000 --> 0:05:03,000
on the religious Reformation.

97
0:05:04.546,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Both reformations were predicated on fractious discussion,

98
0:05:07.621,000 --> 0:05:08,000
internal self-doubt

99
0:05:09.054,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and massive realignment of antiquated business models.

100
0:05:13.106,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And at heart, both reformations, I think, were asking the questions:

101
0:05:16.516,000 --> 0:05:17,000
who's entitled to practice?

102
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
How are they entitled to practice?

103
0:05:19.99,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And indeed, do we need anyone to intermediate for us

104
0:05:24.002,000 --> 0:05:27,000
in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine?

105
0:05:29.095,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Chris Anderson, someone I trust you all know,

106
0:05:31.821,000 --> 0:05:34,000
editor in chief of Wired magazine and author of The Long Tail,

107
0:05:34.857,000 --> 0:05:37,000
really was the first, for me, to nail a lot of this.

108
0:05:37.985,000 --> 0:05:38,000
He wrote a long time ago, you know,

109
0:05:39.68,000 --> 0:05:44,000
thanks to the invention of the Internet, web technology, minicams and more,

110
0:05:45.229,000 --> 0:05:48,000
the means of artistic production have been democratized

111
0:05:48.708,000 --> 0:05:5,000
for the first time in all of human history.

112
0:05:52.483,000 --> 0:05:54,000
In the 1930s, if any of you wanted to make a movie,

113
0:05:54.96,000 --> 0:05:56,000
you had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO,

114
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
because who could afford a movie set

115
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and lighting equipment and editing equipment

116
0:06:01.38,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and scoring, and more?

117
0:06:03.187,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And now who in this room doesn't know a 14 year-old

118
0:06:06.39,000 --> 0:06:08,000
hard at work on her second, third, or fourth movie?

119
0:06:08.945,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Laughter)

120
0:06:10.764,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Similarly, the means of artistic distribution

121
0:06:13.872,000 --> 0:06:15,000
have been democratized for the first time in human history.

122
0:06:16.677,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Again, in the '30s, Warner Brothers, RKO did that for you.

123
0:06:19.652,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Now, go to YouTube, Facebook;

124
0:06:21.716,000 --> 0:06:22,000
you have worldwide distribution

125
0:06:23.664,000 --> 0:06:25,000
without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom.

126
0:06:27.214,000 --> 0:06:29,000
This double impact is occasioning

127
0:06:29.614,000 --> 0:06:31,000
a massive redefinition of the cultural market,

128
0:06:32.626,000 --> 0:06:34,000
a time when anyone is a potential author.

129
0:06:36.542,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Frankly, what we're seeing now in this environment

130
0:06:38.913,000 --> 0:06:41,000
is a massive time, when the entire world is changing

131
0:06:42.037,000 --> 0:06:45,000
as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting.

132
0:06:45.199,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But the number of arts participants,

133
0:06:47.637,000 --> 0:06:5,000
people who write poetry, who sing songs, who perform in church choirs,

134
0:06:51.474,000 --> 0:06:54,000
is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations.

135
0:06:55.58,000 --> 0:06:57,000
This group, others have called the pro-ams,

136
0:06:58.097,000 --> 0:07:,000
amateur artists doing work at a professional level.

137
0:07:01.018,000 --> 0:07:03,000
You see them on YouTube, in dance competitions,

138
0:07:03.235,000 --> 0:07:04,000
film festivals and more.

139
0:07:04.942,000 --> 0:07:05,000
They are radically expanding

140
0:07:06.881,000 --> 0:07:09,000
our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary,

141
0:07:10.084,000 --> 0:07:12,000
while they are challenging and undermining

142
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions.

143
0:07:15.697,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Ultimately, we now live in a world defined not by consumption,

144
0:07:19.561,000 --> 0:07:2,000
but by participation.

145
0:07:22.557,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But I want to be clear,

146
0:07:24.348,000 --> 0:07:26,000
just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end

147
0:07:27.152,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to the formal Church or to the priesthood;

148
0:07:29.189,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance.

149
0:07:33.397,000 --> 0:07:35,000
They currently are the best opportunities

150
0:07:35.599,000 --> 0:07:37,000
for artists to have lives of economic dignity --

151
0:07:37.899,000 --> 0:07:39,000
not opulence, of dignity.

152
0:07:40.108,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And they are the places where artists

153
0:07:41.914,000 --> 0:07:43,000
who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources

154
0:07:44.758,000 --> 0:07:45,000
will find a home.

155
0:07:46.843,000 --> 0:07:5,000
But to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community

156
0:07:50.996,000 --> 0:07:51,000
is, by far, too shortsighted.

157
0:07:53.722,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And indeed, while we've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional,

158
0:07:57.456,000 --> 0:08:01,000
the single most exciting development in the last five to 10 years

159
0:08:01.71,000 --> 0:08:04,000
has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist,

160
0:08:05.537,000 --> 0:08:06,000
the professional artist who works,

161
0:08:07.191,000 --> 0:08:09,000
not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage;

162
0:08:09.936,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but most frequently around women's rights, or human rights,

163
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
or on global warming issues or AIDS relief for more --

164
0:08:16.181,000 --> 0:08:18,000
not out of economic necessity,

165
0:08:18.335,000 --> 0:08:2,000
but out of a deep, organic conviction

166
0:08:20.913,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that the work that she or he is called to do

167
0:08:23.429,000 --> 0:08:26,000
cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment.

168
0:08:27.994,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Today's dance world is not defined solely

169
0:08:30.489,000 --> 0:08:33,000
by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada,

170
0:08:33.702,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but by Liz Lerman's Dance Exchange --

171
0:08:36.172,000 --> 0:08:39,000
a multi-generational, professional dance company,

172
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82,

173
0:08:42.892,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and who work with genomic scientists to embody the DNA strand

174
0:08:46.502,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and with nuclear physicists at CERN.

175
0:08:49.438,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Today's professional theater community

176
0:08:51.594,000 --> 0:08:54,000
is defined, not only the Shaw and Stratford Festivals,

177
0:08:54.883,000 --> 0:08:56,000
but by the Cornerstone Theater of Los Angeles --

178
0:08:57.451,000 --> 0:08:59,000
a collective of artists that after 9/11,

179
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
brought together 10 different religious communities --

180
0:09:03.771,000 --> 0:09:04,000
the Baha'i, the Catholic,

181
0:09:05.583,000 --> 0:09:06,000
the Muslim, the Jewish,

182
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
even the Native American

183
0:09:09.012,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and the gay and lesbian communities of faith,

184
0:09:11.209,000 --> 0:09:14,000
helping them create their own individual plays

185
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and one massive play,

186
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
where they explored the differences in their faith

187
0:09:18.914,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and found commonality

188
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
as an important first step toward cross-community healing.

189
0:09:25.098,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Today's performers, like Rhodessa Jones, work in women's prisons,

190
0:09:28.634,000 --> 0:09:31,000
helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration,

191
0:09:32.17,000 --> 0:09:34,000
while today's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs

192
0:09:35.092,000 --> 0:09:38,000
to find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more.

193
0:09:40.618,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And indeed, I think, rather than being annihilated,

194
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
the performing arts are poised on the brink of a time

195
0:09:45.762,000 --> 0:09:47,000
when we will be more important than we have ever been.

196
0:09:49.701,000 --> 0:09:5,000
You know, we've said for a long time,

197
0:09:51.488,000 --> 0:09:54,000
we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town.

198
0:09:54.852,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And absolutely --

199
0:09:56.035,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community

200
0:10:00.022,000 --> 0:10:03,000
generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy,

201
0:10:03.144,000 --> 0:10:05,000
dollars spent in restaurants or on parking,

202
0:10:05.186,000 --> 0:10:07,000
at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes,

203
0:10:07.758,000 --> 0:10:09,000
the piano tuner who tunes the instruments, and more.

204
0:10:11.045,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward,

205
0:10:14.901,000 --> 0:10:16,000
especially in industries we can't even imagine yet,

206
0:10:17.426,000 --> 0:10:2,000
just as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries,

207
0:10:21.386,000 --> 0:10:24,000
which few, if any of us, could have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago.

208
0:10:26.09,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence,

209
0:10:30.436,000 --> 0:10:31,000
the ability to listen deeply,

210
0:10:32.425,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to have empathy,

211
0:10:33.932,000 --> 0:10:35,000
to articulate change, to motivate others --

212
0:10:36.668,000 --> 0:10:39,000
the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter.

213
0:10:41.408,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Especially now,

214
0:10:43.783,000 --> 0:10:47,000
as we all must confront the fallacy of a market-only orientation,

215
0:10:48.337,000 --> 0:10:5,000
uninformed by social conscience;

216
0:10:50.708,000 --> 0:10:52,000
we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts

217
0:10:53.537,000 --> 0:10:55,000
to shape our individual and national characters,

218
0:10:56.121,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and especially characters of the young people,

219
0:10:59.212,000 --> 0:11:02,000
who all too often are subjected to bombardment of sensation,

220
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
rather than digested experience.

221
0:11:05.506,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Ultimately, especially now in this world,

222
0:11:08.522,000 --> 0:11:12,000
where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws,

223
0:11:13.167,000 --> 0:11:16,000
in reality TV that thrives on humiliation,

224
0:11:16.53,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and in a context of analysis,

225
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
where the thing we hear most repeatedly, day in, day out in the United States,

226
0:11:22.962,000 --> 0:11:25,000
in every train station, every bus station, every plane station is,

227
0:11:26.091,000 --> 0:11:27,000
"Ladies and gentlemen,

228
0:11:27.378,000 --> 0:11:31,000
please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals

229
0:11:31.432,000 --> 0:11:32,000
to the authorities nearest to you,"

230
0:11:33.418,000 --> 0:11:34,000
when all of these ways we are encouraged

231
0:11:35.38,000 --> 0:11:38,000
to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear

232
0:11:38.452,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and contempt and suspicion.

233
0:11:41.176,000 --> 0:11:43,000
The arts, whatever they do, whenever they call us together,

234
0:11:44.043,000 --> 0:11:48,000
invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity.

235
0:11:50.47,000 --> 0:11:54,000
God knows, if we ever needed that capacity in human history,

236
0:11:54.705,000 --> 0:11:56,000
we need it now.

237
0:12:00.374,000 --> 0:12:01,000
You know, we're bound together,

238
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
not, I think by technology, entertainment and design,

239
0:12:05.711,000 --> 0:12:06,000
but by common cause.

240
0:12:07.781,000 --> 0:12:1,000
We work to promote healthy vibrant societies,

241
0:12:11.088,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to ameliorate human suffering,

242
0:12:13.553,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to promote a more thoughtful, substantive, empathic world order.

243
0:12:20.131,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I salute all of you as activists in that quest

244
0:12:22.735,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work,

245
0:12:25.927,000 --> 0:12:26,000
whatever your purpose may be.

246
0:12:28.606,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation

247
0:12:31.549,000 --> 0:12:33,000
is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come.

248
0:12:34.272,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And I thank you for your kindness and your patience

249
0:12:36.682,000 --> 0:12:37,000
in listening to me this afternoon.

250
0:12:38.364,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Thank you, and Godspeed.

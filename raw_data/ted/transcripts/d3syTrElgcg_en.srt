1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Let me share with you today an original discovery.

2
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But I want to tell it to you the way it really happened --

3
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
not the way I present it in a scientific meeting,

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
or the way you'd read it in a scientific paper.

5
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It's a story about beyond biomimetics,

6
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to something I'm calling biomutualism.

7
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I define that as an association between biology and another discipline,

8
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
where each discipline reciprocally advances the other,

9
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
but where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field.

10
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Now, in terms of biomimetics,

11
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature,

12
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
nature becomes a much more useful teacher.

13
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Engineering can be inspired by biology

14
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
by using its principles and analogies when they're advantageous,

15
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but then integrating that with the best human engineering,

16
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
ultimately to make something actually better than nature.

17
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Now, being a biologist, I was very curious about this.

18
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
These are gecko toes.

19
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And we wondered how they use these bizarre toes

20
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to climb up a wall so quickly.

21
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We discovered it. And what we found was

22
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that they have leaf-like structures on their toes,

23
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
with millions of tiny hairs that look like a rug,

24
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and each of those hairs has the worst case of split-ends possible:

25
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
about 100 to 1000 split ends that are nano-size.

26
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And the individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends.

27
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
They don't stick by Velcro or suction or glue.

28
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
They actually stick by intermolecular forces alone,

29
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
van der Waals forces.

30
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And I'm really pleased to report to you today

31
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that the first synthetic self-cleaning, dry adhesive has been made.

32
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
From the simplest version in nature, one branch,

33
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
my engineering collaborator, Ron Fearing, at Berkeley,

34
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
had made the first synthetic version.

35
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And so has my other incredible collaborator,

36
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Mark Cutkosky, at Stanford --

37
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
he made much larger hairs than the gecko,

38
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
but used the same general principles.

39
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And here is its first test.

40
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
That's Kellar Autumn, my former Ph.D. student,

42
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
professor now at Lewis and Clark,

43
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
literally giving his first-born child up for this test.

44
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
More recently, this happened.

46
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Man: This the first time someone has actually climbed with it.

47
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Narrator: Lynn Verinsky, a professional climber,

48
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
who appeared to be brimming with confidence.

49
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Lynn Verinsky: Honestly, it's going to be perfectly safe. It will be perfectly safe.

50
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Man: How do you know?

51
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Lynn Verinsky: Because of liability insurance. (Laughter)

52
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Narrator: With a mattress below and attached to a safety rope,

53
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Lynn began her 60-foot ascent.

54
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Lynn made it to the top in a perfect pairing

55
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
of Hollywood and science.

56
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Man: So you're the first human being to officially emulate a gecko.

57
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Lynn Verinsky: Ha! Wow. And what a privilege that has been.

58
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Robert Full: That's what she did on rough surfaces.

59
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But she actually used these on smooth surfaces --

60
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
two of them -- to climb up, and pull herself up.

61
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And you can try this in the lobby,

62
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and look at the gecko-inspired material.

63
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Now the problem with the robots doing this

64
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is that they can't get unstuck,

65
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
with the material.

66
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
This is the gecko's solution. They actually peel their toes away

67
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
from the surface, at high rates,

68
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
as they run up the wall.

69
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Well I'm really excited today to show you

70
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
the newest version of a robot, Stickybot,

71
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
using a new hierarchical dry adhesive.

72
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Here is the actual robot.

73
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And here is what it does.

74
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And if you look,

75
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
you can see that it uses

76
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
the toe peeling,

77
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
just like the gecko does.

78
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
If we can show some of the video, you can see it climbing up the wall.

79
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Applause)

80
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
There it is.

81
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive

82
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that the Stanford group was able to do

83
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
in designing this incredible robot.

84
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
(Applause)

85
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Oh. One thing I want to point out is, look at Stickybot.

86
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
You see something on it. It's not just to look like a gecko.

87
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It has a tail. And just when you think you've figured out nature,

88
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
this kind of thing happens.

89
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The engineers told us, for the climbing robots,

90
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that, if they don't have a tail,

91
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
they fall off the wall.

92
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So what they did was they asked us

93
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
an important question.

94
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
They said, "Well, it kind of looks like a tail."

95
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Even though we put a passive bar there.

96
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"Do animals use their tails when they climb up walls?"

97
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
What they were doing was returning the favor,

98
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
by giving us a hypothesis to test,

99
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
in biology, that we wouldn't have thought of.

100
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So of course, in reality, we were then panicked,

101
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
being the biologists, and we should know this already.

102
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
We said, "Well, what do tails do?"

103
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Well we know that tails store fat, for example.

104
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
We know that you can grab onto things with them.

105
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And perhaps it is most well known

106
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that they provide static balance.

107
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It can also act as a counterbalance.

109
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So watch this kangaroo.

110
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
See that tail? That's incredible!

111
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Marc Raibert built a Uniroo hopping robot.

112
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And it was unstable without its tail.

113
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Now mostly tails limit maneuverability,

114
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
like this human inside this dinosaur suit.

115
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
My colleagues actually went on to test this limitation,

117
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
by increasing the moment of inertia of a student, so they had a tail,

118
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and running them through and obstacle course,

119
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and found a decrement in performance,

120
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
like you'd predict.

121
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But of course, this is a passive tail.

123
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And you can also have active tails.

124
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And when I went back to research this, I realized

125
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that one of the great TED moments in the past,

126
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
from Nathan,

127
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
we've talked about an active tail.

128
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Video: Myhrvold thinks tail-cracking dinosaurs

129
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
were interested in love, not war.

130
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Robert Full: He talked about the tail being a whip for communication.

131
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It can also be used in defense.

132
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Pretty powerful.

133
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So we then went back and looked at the animal.

134
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And we ran it up a surface.

135
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But this time what we did is we put a slippery patch

136
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that you see in yellow there.

137
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail

138
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
when it slips. This is slowed down 10 times.

139
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So here is normal speed.

140
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And watch it now slip,

141
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and see what it does with its tail.

142
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
It has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg,

143
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and it contributes to stability.

144
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
If you make it slip a huge amount, this is what we discovered.

145
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
This is incredible.

146
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
The engineers had a really good idea.

147
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And then of course we wondered,

148
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
okay, they have an active tail, but let's picture them.

149
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
They're climbing up a wall, or a tree.

150
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And they get to the top and let's say there's some leaves there.

151
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf,

152
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and there was some wind, or we shook it?

153
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And we did that experiment, that you see here.

154
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Applause)

155
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And this is what we discovered.

156
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Now that's real time. You can't see anything.

157
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
But there it is slowed down.

158
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
What we discovered was the world's fastest air-righting response.

159
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
For those of you who remember your physics, that's a zero-angular-momentum

160
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
righting response. But it's like a cat.

161
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
You know, cats falling. Cats do this. They twist their bodies.

162
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
But geckos do it better.

163
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And they do it with their tail.

164
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So they do it with this active tail as they swing around.

165
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And then they always land in the sort of superman skydiving posture.

166
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Okay, now we wondered, if we were right,

167
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
we should be able to test this in a physical model, in a robot.

168
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So for TED we actually built a robot,

169
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
over there, a prototype, with the tail.

170
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And we're going to attempt the first air-righting response

171
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
in a tail, with a robot.

172
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
If we could have the lights on it.

173
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Okay, there it goes.

174
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And show the video.

175
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
There it is.

176
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And it works just like it does in the animal.

177
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself.

178
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
(Applause)

179
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Now, of course, we were normally frightened

180
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
because the animal has no gliding adaptations,

181
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
so we thought, "Oh that's okay. We'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel.

182
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
We'll blow the air up, we'll give it a landing target, a tree trunk,

183
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
just outside the plexi-glass enclosure, and see what it does.

184
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Laughter)

185
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So we did. And here is what it does.

186
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So the wind is coming from the bottom. This is slowed down 10 times.

187
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
It does an equilibrium glide. Highly controlled.

188
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
This is sort of incredible. But actually it's quite beautiful,

189
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
when you take a picture of it.

190
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And it's better than that, it -- just in the slide -- maneuvers in mid-air.

191
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And the way it does it, is it takes its tail

192
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and it swings it one way to yaw left, and it swings its other way to yaw right.

193
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So we can maneuver this way.

194
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And then -- we had to film this several times to believe this --

195
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
it also does this. Watch this.

196
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin.

197
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
It can actually swim through the air.

198
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
But watch its front legs. Can you see what they are doing?

199
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
What does that mean for the origin of flapping flight?

200
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Maybe it's evolved from coming down from trees,

201
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and trying to control a glide.

202
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Stay tuned for that.

203
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Laughter)

204
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So then we wondered, "Can they actually maneuver with this?"

205
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So there is the landing target. Could they steer towards it

206
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
with these capabilities? Here it is in the wind tunnel.

207
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And it certainly looks like it.

208
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
You can see it even better from down on top.

209
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Watch the animal.

210
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Definitely moving towards the landing target.

211
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Watch the whip of its tail as it does it. Look at that.

212
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
It's unbelievable.

213
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So now we were really confused,

214
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
because there are no reports of it gliding.

215
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So we went, "Oh my god, we have to go to the field,

216
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and see if it actually does this."

217
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Completely opposite of the way you'd see it on a nature film, of course.

218
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
We wondered, "Do they actually glide in nature?"

219
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Well we went to the forests of Singapore and Southeast Asia.

220
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And the next video you see is the first time we've showed this.

221
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
This is the actual video -- not staged, a real research video --

222
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
of animal gliding down. There is a red trajectory line.

223
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Look at the end to see the animal.

224
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
But then as it gets closer to the tree,

225
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
look at the close-up. And see if you can see it land.

226
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So there it comes down. There is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line.

227
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
You see it there? There? Watch it come down.

228
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Now watch up there and you can see the landing. Did you see it hit?

229
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
It actually uses its tail too,

230
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
just like we saw in the lab.

231
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So now we can continue this mutualism

232
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
by suggesting that they can make an active tail.

233
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And here is the first active tail, in the robot,

234
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
made by Boston Dynamics.

235
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So to conclude, I think we need to build biomutualisms, like I showed,

236
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that will increase the pace of basic discovery in their application.

237
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
To do this though, we need to redesign education in a major way,

238
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
to balance depth with interdisciplinary communication,

239
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and explicitly train people how to contribute to, and benefit from other disciplines.

240
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And of course you need the organisms and the environment to do it.

241
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
That is, whether you care about security, search and rescue or health,

242
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
we must preserve nature's designs,

243
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
otherwise these secrets will be lost forever.

244
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And from what I heard from our new president,

245
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I'm very optimistic. Thank you.

246
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
(Applause)

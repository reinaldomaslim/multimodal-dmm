1
0:00:12.95,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Thousands of years from now,

2
0:00:15.088,000 --> 0:00:18,000
we'll look back at the first century of computing

3
0:00:18.96,000 --> 0:00:21,000
as a fascinating but very peculiar time --

4
0:00:23.096,000 --> 0:00:28,000
the only time in history where humans were reduced to live in 2D space,

5
0:00:28.126,000 --> 0:00:31,000
interacting with technology as if we were machines;

6
0:00:32.069,000 --> 0:00:37,000
a singular, 100-year period in the vastness of time

7
0:00:37.31,000 --> 0:00:39,000
where humans communicated,

8
0:00:40.022,000 --> 0:00:42,000
were entertained and managed their lives

9
0:00:42.697,000 --> 0:00:43,000
from behind a screen.

10
0:00:44.395,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Today, we spend most of our time tapping and looking at screens.

11
0:00:50.762,000 --> 0:00:53,000
What happened to interacting with each other?

12
0:00:55.04,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I don't know about you, but I feel limited

13
0:00:57.735,000 --> 0:01:,000
inside this 2D world of monitors and pixels.

14
0:01:01.751,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And it is this very limitation

15
0:01:03.84,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and my desire to connect with people

16
0:01:06.28,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that inspires me as a creator.

17
0:01:08.292,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Put simply: I want to create a new reality,

18
0:01:11.667,000 --> 0:01:16,000
a reality where technology brings us infinitely closer to each other,

19
0:01:17.398,000 --> 0:01:2,000
a reality where people, not devices,

20
0:01:20.612,000 --> 0:01:21,000
are the center of everything.

21
0:01:22.998,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I dream of a reality where technology senses what we see, touch and feel;

22
0:01:29.724,000 --> 0:01:32,000
a reality where technology no longer gets in our way,

23
0:01:33.059,000 --> 0:01:35,000
but instead embraces who we are.

24
0:01:36.328,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I dream of technology

25
0:01:38.728,000 --> 0:01:39,000
on a human path.

26
0:01:40.878,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We have all experienced technology

27
0:01:42.91,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that enables people to act more like people,

28
0:01:46.236,000 --> 0:01:5,000
products that enable natural interactions, voice controls or biometrics.

29
0:01:55.476,000 --> 0:01:58,000
This is the next step in the evolution.

30
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
This is Microsoft HoloLens,

31
0:02:01.309,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the first fully untethered holographic computer.

32
0:02:05.644,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Devices like this will bring 3D holographic content

33
0:02:09.861,000 --> 0:02:1,000
right into our world,

34
0:02:11.804,000 --> 0:02:13,000
enhancing the way we experience life

35
0:02:13.885,000 --> 0:02:15,000
beyond our ordinary range of perceptions.

36
0:02:17.233,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Now, I'm not thinking about a distant future.

37
0:02:21.844,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I'm talking about today.

38
0:02:23.958,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We are already seeing car companies like Volvo

39
0:02:27.126,000 --> 0:02:29,000
designing cars differently with HoloLens;

40
0:02:30.077,000 --> 0:02:34,000
universities like Case Western redefining the way medical students learn;

41
0:02:34.832,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and my personal favorite,

42
0:02:36.744,000 --> 0:02:41,000
NASA is using HoloLens to let scientists explore planets

43
0:02:42.115,000 --> 0:02:43,000
holographically.

44
0:02:43.932,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Now, this is important.

45
0:02:46.194,000 --> 0:02:48,000
By bringing holograms into our world,

46
0:02:48.66,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I'm not just talking about a new device or a better computer.

47
0:02:52.914,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I'm talking about freeing ourselves from the 2D confines

48
0:02:58.341,000 --> 0:02:59,000
of traditional computing.

49
0:03:01.334,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Put it this way:

50
0:03:02.961,000 --> 0:03:06,000
temporally adjusted, we're like cave people in computer terms.

51
0:03:07.878,000 --> 0:03:08,000
We've barely discovered charcoal

52
0:03:09.816,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and started drawing the first stick figures in our cave.

53
0:03:14.925,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Now, this is the perspective I apply to my work every single day.

54
0:03:20.016,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And now for the next few minutes,

55
0:03:21.991,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I invite all of you to apply the same perspective

56
0:03:26.314,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to the journey ahead of us.

57
0:03:31.461,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Now, as I put this HoloLens on,

58
0:03:34.405,000 --> 0:03:36,000
let me explain the setup a little bit.

59
0:03:36.608,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It's probably the most risky demo we have ever done on any stage

60
0:03:42.004,000 --> 0:03:43,000
with HoloLens,

61
0:03:43.262,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and I can't think of a better place to do it than here at TED.

62
0:03:47.221,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Momentarily, I am going to be seeing holograms

63
0:03:51.019,000 --> 0:03:52,000
right on this stage,

64
0:03:52.365,000 --> 0:03:54,000
just as clearly as I can see all of you.

65
0:03:54.645,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Now at the same time, we have also this special camera

66
0:03:58.307,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that just walked in onstage

67
0:04:00.027,000 --> 0:04:03,000
so that all of you can share in this experience with me

68
0:04:03.283,000 --> 0:04:04,000
up on all the monitors.

69
0:04:05.917,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So let's start our journey.

70
0:04:07.296,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And what better place to begin our journey,

71
0:04:09.756,000 --> 0:04:12,000
than in the computer cave of 2D.

72
0:04:14.978,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Let's explore the world all around us with this new lens,

73
0:04:19.193,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and understand the computer world from a brand new perspective.

74
0:04:23.673,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The computer universe is both marvelous and primitive.

75
0:04:28.933,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It's a universe based on causality.

76
0:04:32.112,000 --> 0:04:35,000
As developers, we dream the different causes

77
0:04:35.304,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and then we program the different effects.

78
0:04:38.084,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Double click on an icon, that's a cause.

79
0:04:41.582,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Open an application, that's an effect.

80
0:04:45.264,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Now when we compare this to our physical universe,

81
0:04:49.535,000 --> 0:04:51,000
it is overly constraining,

82
0:04:51.574,000 --> 0:04:53,000
because our universe is not digital.

83
0:04:54.747,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Our universe is analog.

84
0:04:56.662,000 --> 0:05:,000
Our universe doesn't think in terms of zero or one,

85
0:05:01.24,000 --> 0:05:03,000
true or false, or black or white.

86
0:05:04.663,000 --> 0:05:08,000
We exist in a world governed by quantum physics,

87
0:05:08.933,000 --> 0:05:12,000
a universe of zero and one both at the same time,

88
0:05:13.88,000 --> 0:05:17,000
a reality based on infinite probabilities and shades of gray.

89
0:05:19.384,000 --> 0:05:22,000
You can see how these two worlds collide.

90
0:05:23.975,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So why are screens so pervasive in our analog life?

91
0:05:30.366,000 --> 0:05:32,000
We see screens from the moment we wake up,

92
0:05:32.991,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to the moment we fall asleep.

93
0:05:35.174,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Why?

94
0:05:36.666,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I think it's because computers give us superpowers.

95
0:05:40.393,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Within the digital universe, we have the power to displace space

96
0:05:44.123,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and the power to displace time.

97
0:05:46.381,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It doesn't matter if you're using technology for entertainment,

98
0:05:49.741,000 --> 0:05:51,000
productivity or communication.

99
0:05:52.7,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Think of it this way:

100
0:05:53.885,000 --> 0:05:54,000
let's all go home tonight

101
0:05:55.289,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and watch our favorite show on television.

102
0:05:58.462,000 --> 0:06:01,000
This is theater -- time and space displaced.

103
0:06:02.634,000 --> 0:06:04,000
As soon as I'm done with this TED Talk,

104
0:06:04.758,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I'm going to immediately call my lovely family in Seattle.

105
0:06:11.261,000 --> 0:06:12,000
That's displacement of space.

106
0:06:14.088,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Now, these are such great superpowers

107
0:06:16.335,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that we put up with the two-dimensional limitations

108
0:06:19.308,000 --> 0:06:2,000
of our current digital world.

109
0:06:21.121,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But what if we didn't have to?

110
0:06:23.18,000 --> 0:06:26,000
What if we could have these same digital powers

111
0:06:27.168,000 --> 0:06:28,000
in our world?

112
0:06:29.966,000 --> 0:06:31,000
You can already see glimmers of this,

113
0:06:32.386,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but I believe our children's children

114
0:06:35.062,000 --> 0:06:38,000
will grow up in a world devoid of 2D technology.

115
0:06:40.079,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It's remarkable to dream of this world,

116
0:06:42.518,000 --> 0:06:46,000
a world where technology truly understands us --

117
0:06:46.731,000 --> 0:06:48,000
where we live, work and communicate --

118
0:06:49.285,000 --> 0:06:52,000
with tools that enhance the human experience,

119
0:06:52.971,000 --> 0:06:55,000
not machines that limit our humanity.

120
0:06:58.642,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So how do we get there?

121
0:07:01.182,000 --> 0:07:05,000
For me, the answer required looking at the problem

122
0:07:05.296,000 --> 0:07:06,000
from a different perspective.

123
0:07:08.93,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It required sensing the world from the perspective of a machine.

124
0:07:14.429,000 --> 0:07:17,000
If you're a machine trying to sense our world,

125
0:07:18.055,000 --> 0:07:2,000
how would you actually break the problem down?

126
0:07:21.137,000 --> 0:07:23,000
You'd probably try to classify things

127
0:07:23.856,000 --> 0:07:24,000
as a human,

128
0:07:26.205,000 --> 0:07:27,000
an environment

129
0:07:28.999,000 --> 0:07:29,000
or an object.

130
0:07:31.973,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But how would that machine then interact with reality?

131
0:07:37.063,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And I can think of three ways.

132
0:07:38.712,000 --> 0:07:4,000
First, as a machine,

133
0:07:40.902,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I would observe or I would input reality.

134
0:07:45.847,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Speech recognition and biometric authentication

135
0:07:48.553,000 --> 0:07:51,000
are great examples of a machine interacting with humans

136
0:07:51.837,000 --> 0:07:52,000
from an input perspective.

137
0:07:54.481,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Secondly, as a machine,

138
0:07:56.796,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I could place digital information, or output information,

139
0:08:01.931,000 --> 0:08:02,000
into reality.

140
0:08:03.939,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Holograms are examples of a machine interacting with an environment

141
0:08:08.635,000 --> 0:08:09,000
from an output perspective.

142
0:08:10.968,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Finally, as a machine,

143
0:08:13.11,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I could exchange energy with the world via haptics.

144
0:08:17.8,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Now, imagine being able to feel the temperature of a virtual object,

145
0:08:22.416,000 --> 0:08:25,000
or better yet, imagine pushing a hologram

146
0:08:25.659,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and having it push you back with equal force.

147
0:08:29.455,000 --> 0:08:3,000
With this perspective,

148
0:08:31.186,000 --> 0:08:35,000
we are able to collapse reality into a simple matrix.

149
0:08:36.172,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Now here's a secret:

150
0:08:37.347,000 --> 0:08:39,000
as an engineer, I get really excited

151
0:08:39.429,000 --> 0:08:41,000
anytime I can reduce something to the matrix.

152
0:08:42.783,000 --> 0:08:44,000
From self-driving cars

153
0:08:44.846,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to smartphones

154
0:08:46.459,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to this holographic computer on my head,

155
0:08:48.805,000 --> 0:08:51,000
machines are becoming capable of understanding our world.

156
0:08:53.293,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And they are starting to interact with us

157
0:08:55.852,000 --> 0:08:58,000
in significantly more personal ways.

158
0:09:00.197,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Now, imagine having granular control

159
0:09:03.846,000 --> 0:09:04,000
over everything in the world.

160
0:09:06.78,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Move the dial one way,

161
0:09:10.93,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and you get reality.

162
0:09:13.268,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Move the dial the other way,

163
0:09:17.582,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and you get virtual reality.

164
0:09:21.748,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Now, imagine dialing your entire environment

165
0:09:26.863,000 --> 0:09:29,000
between virtual and real worlds.

166
0:09:34.462,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I love it down here.

167
0:09:36.663,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Now, imagine if I could look at all of you

168
0:09:40.154,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and dial from real humans into elves.

169
0:09:44.76,000 --> 0:09:46,000
When technology truly understands our world,

170
0:09:47.548,000 --> 0:09:5,000
it will again transform the ways we interact,

171
0:09:51.219,000 --> 0:09:53,000
the ways we work and the ways we play.

172
0:09:59.238,000 --> 0:10:,000
Less than half a century ago,

173
0:10:01.798,000 --> 0:10:03,000
two courageous men landed on the moon,

174
0:10:04.696,000 --> 0:10:07,000
using computers that were less powerful than the phones in your pockets.

175
0:10:09.11,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Six hundred million humans watched them

176
0:10:12.245,000 --> 0:10:14,000
on grainy, black-and-white televisions.

177
0:10:15.579,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And the world?

178
0:10:17.096,000 --> 0:10:19,000
The world was mesmerized.

179
0:10:20.03,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Now imagine how our children and their children

180
0:10:24.986,000 --> 0:10:27,000
will experience the continued exploration of space

181
0:10:28.547,000 --> 0:10:31,000
with technology that understands this world.

182
0:10:33.355,000 --> 0:10:37,000
We already live in a world where real-time universal translators exist.

183
0:10:38.174,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And I can squint, and I can already see holographic telepresence

184
0:10:43.333,000 --> 0:10:44,000
in our near future.

185
0:10:45.079,000 --> 0:10:48,000
In fact, since we've been lucky with our demo so far,

186
0:10:48.182,000 --> 0:10:5,000
let's try doing something else even more crazy.

187
0:10:51.153,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I invite you to experience,

188
0:10:53.93,000 --> 0:10:56,000
for the first time anywhere in the world,

189
0:10:56.991,000 --> 0:10:58,000
here on the TED stage,

190
0:10:59.5,000 --> 0:11:02,000
a real-life holographic teleportation,

191
0:11:03.953,000 --> 0:11:06,000
between me and my friend, Dr. Jeffrey Norris,

192
0:11:07.684,000 --> 0:11:09,000
from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

193
0:11:10.506,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Finger crossed. Hi, Jeff.

194
0:11:14.514,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Jeff Norris: Hey, Alex.

195
0:11:15.704,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Alex Kipman: Phew! That worked. How are you doing today, Jeff?

196
0:11:18.831,000 --> 0:11:2,000
(Applause)

197
0:11:20.958,000 --> 0:11:22,000
JN: Doing great. I had an awesome week.

198
0:11:23.046,000 --> 0:11:26,000
AK: So, can you tell us a little bit, Jeff, about where you are?

199
0:11:28.197,000 --> 0:11:31,000
JN: Well, I'm actually in three places.

200
0:11:31.222,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I'm standing in a room across the street,

201
0:11:34.127,000 --> 0:11:37,000
while I'm standing on this stage with you,

202
0:11:37.155,000 --> 0:11:41,000
while I'm standing on Mars, a hundred million miles away.

203
0:11:41.981,000 --> 0:11:44,000
AK: Wow, a hundred million miles away. This is crazy!

204
0:11:45.697,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Can you tell us a little bit more about where all this data

205
0:11:48.507,000 --> 0:11:49,000
from Mars is coming from?

206
0:11:52.005,000 --> 0:11:53,000
JN: Absolutely.

207
0:11:53.481,000 --> 0:11:57,000
This is a precise holographic replica of Mars,

208
0:11:57.591,000 --> 0:12:,000
built from data captured by the Curiosity Mars Rover,

209
0:12:00.795,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that I can explore as easily as a place on Earth.

210
0:12:05.056,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Humans are natural explorers.

211
0:12:08.334,000 --> 0:12:1,000
We can instantly understand an environment,

212
0:12:10.919,000 --> 0:12:11,000
just by being present in it.

213
0:12:13.773,000 --> 0:12:15,000
We've built tools like our Mars Rover

214
0:12:15.817,000 --> 0:12:18,000
to extend our vision and lengthen our reach.

215
0:12:19.441,000 --> 0:12:21,000
But for decades,

216
0:12:21.576,000 --> 0:12:24,000
we've explored from a seat behind screens and keyboards.

217
0:12:26.779,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Now, we're leaping over all of that,

218
0:12:29.652,000 --> 0:12:32,000
over the giant antennas and the relay satellites

219
0:12:32.879,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and the vastness between worlds

220
0:12:35.178,000 --> 0:12:4,000
to take our first steps on this landscape as if we were truly there.

221
0:12:41.502,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Today, a group of scientists on our mission

222
0:12:44.114,000 --> 0:12:47,000
are seeing Mars as never before --

223
0:12:47.522,000 --> 0:12:5,000
an alien world made a little more familiar,

224
0:12:50.863,000 --> 0:12:53,000
because they're finally exploring it as humans should.

225
0:12:55.225,000 --> 0:12:59,000
But our dreams don't have to end with making it just like being there.

226
0:12:59.935,000 --> 0:13:01,000
When we dial this real world to the virtual,

227
0:13:02.373,000 --> 0:13:04,000
we can do magical things.

228
0:13:05.092,000 --> 0:13:07,000
We can see in invisible wavelengths

229
0:13:07.507,000 --> 0:13:09,000
or teleport to the top of a mountain.

230
0:13:10.882,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Perhaps someday, we'll feel the minerals in a rock just by touching it.

231
0:13:17.003,000 --> 0:13:18,000
We're taking the first steps.

232
0:13:19.177,000 --> 0:13:22,000
But we want the whole world to join us in taking the next,

233
0:13:22.951,000 --> 0:13:24,000
because this is not a journey for a few,

234
0:13:25.738,000 --> 0:13:26,000
but for all of us.

235
0:13:28.36,000 --> 0:13:29,000
AK: Thank you Jeff, this was amazing.

236
0:13:30.249,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Thank you so much for joining us on the TED stage today.

237
0:13:33.01,000 --> 0:13:39,000
(Applause)

238
0:13:39.747,000 --> 0:13:41,000
JN: Thank you Alex, bye bye.

239
0:13:42.483,000 --> 0:13:43,000
AK: Bye, Jeff.

240
0:13:50.562,000 --> 0:13:56,000
(Applause)

241
0:13:57.908,000 --> 0:14:,000
I dream about this future

242
0:14:01.145,000 --> 0:14:02,000
every single day.

243
0:14:04.08,000 --> 0:14:06,000
I take inspiration from our ancestors.

244
0:14:06.855,000 --> 0:14:08,000
We used to live in tribes where we interacted,

245
0:14:09.404,000 --> 0:14:11,000
communicated and worked together.

246
0:14:12.509,000 --> 0:14:16,000
We are all beginning to build technology that will enable us to return

247
0:14:17.526,000 --> 0:14:2,000
to the humanity that brought us where we are today --

248
0:14:21.419,000 --> 0:14:26,000
technology that will let us stop living inside this 2D world

249
0:14:26.56,000 --> 0:14:28,000
of monitors and pixels,

250
0:14:28.592,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and let us start remembering what it feels like

251
0:14:33.363,000 --> 0:14:36,000
to live in our 3D world.

252
0:14:37.938,000 --> 0:14:4,000
It's a phenomenal time to be human.

253
0:14:42.147,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Thank you.

254
0:14:43.344,000 --> 0:14:48,000
(Applause)

255
0:14:48.437,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Helen Walters: Thanks so much. I have some questions.

256
0:14:50.958,000 --> 0:14:51,000
AK: OK.

257
0:14:52.133,000 --> 0:14:54,000
HW: So there's been some talk in the press.

258
0:14:54.579,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And I'll just ask you straight, then we have a straight answer.

259
0:14:57.629,000 --> 0:14:59,000
There's been talk about the difference between the demos

260
0:15:00.335,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and the reality of the commercial product.

261
0:15:02.541,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Talk about this field of view issue.

262
0:15:04.516,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Is this type of experience what someone who buys the product will get?

263
0:15:08.859,000 --> 0:15:09,000
AK: It's a great question,

264
0:15:10.842,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Or, said better, this is a question we've been receiving

265
0:15:13.517,000 --> 0:15:15,000
in the media for possibly the last year.

266
0:15:16.204,000 --> 0:15:18,000
If you do your research, I haven't answered that question.

267
0:15:18.975,000 --> 0:15:19,000
I've purposely ignored it,

268
0:15:20.405,000 --> 0:15:22,000
because ultimately, it's the wrong question to ask.

269
0:15:23.535,000 --> 0:15:29,000
That's the equivalent of me showing holograms to someone for the first time,

270
0:15:29.983,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and you then saying, "What's the size of your television?"

271
0:15:33.817,000 --> 0:15:35,000
The field of view for the product is almost irrelevant.

272
0:15:36.535,000 --> 0:15:39,000
What we should be talking about is the density of lights,

273
0:15:40.057,000 --> 0:15:41,000
or radiance, that shows up.

274
0:15:41.867,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Better said, what the angular resolution is of the things that you see.

275
0:15:45.262,000 --> 0:15:47,000
So from that perspective, what you saw --

276
0:15:47.286,000 --> 0:15:49,000
you know, the camera is wearing a HoloLens.

277
0:15:49.373,000 --> 0:15:5,000
So even if I wanted to cheat, I can't.

278
0:15:51.381,000 --> 0:15:54,000
HW: But the camera has a different lens on it than our eye. Right?

279
0:15:54.971,000 --> 0:15:56,000
AK: The camera has a fish-eye lens on it.

280
0:15:57.915,000 --> 0:15:59,000
It's seeing a much wider view than the human eye is.

281
0:16:00.86,000 --> 0:16:04,000
So if you think about the points of light that show up radially

282
0:16:05.189,000 --> 0:16:06,000
from the vision of the camera,

283
0:16:06.727,000 --> 0:16:07,000
which is the thing that matters:

284
0:16:08.472,000 --> 0:16:1,000
how many points of light can I get in a given volume?

285
0:16:11.054,000 --> 0:16:15,000
That's the same as I get on this HoloLens as I will on that one.

286
0:16:15.205,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Now, this camera sees a much wider view of the world, right?

287
0:16:20.21,000 --> 0:16:21,000
HW: Jesus Christ!

288
0:16:21.457,000 --> 0:16:22,000
(Laughter)

289
0:16:22.482,000 --> 0:16:24,000
AK: He did show up! I told you he'd show up.

290
0:16:24.585,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Come this way.

291
0:16:25.808,000 --> 0:16:26,000
(Laughter)

292
0:16:27.696,000 --> 0:16:28,000
HW: Oh, shit.

293
0:16:29.723,000 --> 0:16:31,000
AK: And there's holographic Jeff Norris.

294
0:16:32.199,000 --> 0:16:35,000
HW: I knew something was happening, but I really wasn't sure what.

295
0:16:35.841,000 --> 0:16:36,000
AK: So in short: to be super crisp,

296
0:16:37.612,000 --> 0:16:4,000
the camera that you see on the screen has a wider field of view

297
0:16:40.652,000 --> 0:16:41,000
than the human eye.

298
0:16:41.874,000 --> 0:16:44,000
But the angular resolution of the holograms that you see,

299
0:16:45.105,000 --> 0:16:48,000
the points of light per unit of area,

300
0:16:49.098,000 --> 0:16:5,000
are actually the same.

301
0:16:50.288,000 --> 0:16:53,000
HW: So you spent -- Jeff, I'll get to you in a minute --

302
0:16:53.451,000 --> 0:16:57,000
so you spent a lot of time mapping the stage --

303
0:16:58.055,000 --> 0:16:59,000
AK: That's right.

304
0:16:59.429,000 --> 0:17:,000
HW: So help me out here:

305
0:17:00.627,000 --> 0:17:01,000
if I buy a HoloLens and have it at home,

306
0:17:02.62,000 --> 0:17:03,000
I don't need to map my apartment, right?

307
0:17:04.581,000 --> 0:17:08,000
AK: The HoloLens maps in real time at about five frames per second,

308
0:17:08.718,000 --> 0:17:1,000
with this technology that we call spatial mapping.

309
0:17:11.143,000 --> 0:17:13,000
So in your home, as soon as you put it on,

310
0:17:13.194,000 --> 0:17:15,000
holograms will start showing up, and you'll start placing them

311
0:17:16.148,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and they'll start learning your home.

312
0:17:17.963,000 --> 0:17:2,000
In a stage environment where we're trying to get something on my head

313
0:17:21.496,000 --> 0:17:23,000
to communicate with something over there

314
0:17:23.671,000 --> 0:17:26,000
with all of the wireless connectivity that usually brings all conferences down,

315
0:17:27.666,000 --> 0:17:3,000
we don't take the risk of trying to do this live.

316
0:17:32.027,000 --> 0:17:35,000
So what we do is pre-map the stage at five frames per second

317
0:17:35.105,000 --> 0:17:37,000
with the same spatial-mapping technology

318
0:17:37.153,000 --> 0:17:38,000
that you'll use with the product at home,

319
0:17:39.164,000 --> 0:17:4,000
and then we store it,

320
0:17:40.339,000 --> 0:17:43,000
so that when there's shenanigans of wireless in an environment like this,

321
0:17:43.817,000 --> 0:17:46,000
between the camera's HoloLens and the one on my head,

322
0:17:46.858,000 --> 0:17:47,000
we don't have things disappear.

323
0:17:48.475,000 --> 0:17:51,000
Because ultimately, the holograms are coming from this HoloLens,

324
0:17:51.928,000 --> 0:17:53,000
and that one is just viewing the HoloLens.

325
0:17:53.992,000 --> 0:17:54,000
So if I lose connectivity,

326
0:17:55.941,000 --> 0:17:57,000
you would stop seeing beautiful things on the screen.

327
0:17:58.492,000 --> 0:17:59,000
HW: And it was beautiful.

328
0:18:00.079,000 --> 0:18:01,000
Um ... Jeff?

329
0:18:02.538,000 --> 0:18:03,000
JN: Yes?

330
0:18:04.367,000 --> 0:18:05,000
HW: Hi.

331
0:18:07.543,000 --> 0:18:08,000
AK: I'll take a step back.

332
0:18:08.818,000 --> 0:18:1,000
HW: So Jeff, you were on Mars,

333
0:18:11.772,000 --> 0:18:13,000
you were here, you were in a room across the street.

334
0:18:14.303,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Tell me more about the fact that, with holograms, you have sight

335
0:18:18.529,000 --> 0:18:2,000
but you don't have touch, you don't have smell.

336
0:18:21.254,000 --> 0:18:23,000
Is this scientifically useful now?

337
0:18:24.824,000 --> 0:18:25,000
That's my question for a hologram.

338
0:18:27.044,000 --> 0:18:28,000
JN: Thanks for the question.

339
0:18:28.864,000 --> 0:18:3,000
Absolutely, I believe that these technologies

340
0:18:31.401,000 --> 0:18:33,000
are scientifically useful right now,

341
0:18:33.449,000 --> 0:18:37,000
and that's why we're using them in multiple parts of our work at NASA.

342
0:18:38.077,000 --> 0:18:41,000
So we're using it to improve the ways that we explore Mars.

343
0:18:41.72,000 --> 0:18:44,000
We're also using it for our astronauts on the space station.

344
0:18:45.205,000 --> 0:18:47,000
We're even using it now to design

345
0:18:47.681,000 --> 0:18:49,000
the next generation of our spacecraft.

346
0:18:50.834,000 --> 0:18:53,000
HW: Amazing. OK, Jeff, please go away. Thank you very much.

347
0:18:53.892,000 --> 0:18:55,000
(Laughter)

348
0:18:56.125,000 --> 0:18:59,000
Alex, really, that was amazing. Thank you so much.

349
0:18:59.636,000 --> 0:19:,000
AK: Thank you.

350
0:19:00.818,000 --> 0:19:01,000
HW: Thank you. Thank you.

351
0:19:02.103,000 --> 0:19:04,000
(Applause)

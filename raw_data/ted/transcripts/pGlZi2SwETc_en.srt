2
0:00:13.37,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Imagine you're in a bar, or a club,

3
0:00:19.12,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and you start talking, and after a while, the question comes up,

4
0:00:22.13,000 --> 0:00:23,000
"So, what do you do for work?"

5
0:00:24.015,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And since you think your job is interesting,

6
0:00:26.95,000 --> 0:00:3,000
you say, "I'm a mathematician." (Laughter)

7
0:00:31.69,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And inevitably, during that conversation

8
0:00:34.08,000 --> 0:00:37,000
one of these two phrases come up:

9
0:00:37.75,000 --> 0:00:4,000
A) "I was terrible at math, but it wasn't my fault.

10
0:00:41.195,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It's because the teacher was awful." (Laughter)

11
0:00:44.613,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Or B) "But what is math really for?"

12
0:00:47.582,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:48.61,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I'll now address Case B.

14
0:00:50.955,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:52.51,000 --> 0:00:56,000
When someone asks you what math is for, they're not asking you

16
0:00:57.354,000 --> 0:00:59,000
about applications of mathematical science.

17
0:01:00.203,000 --> 0:01:01,000
They're asking you,

18
0:01:01.554,000 --> 0:01:04,000
why did I have to study that bullshit I never used in my life again? (Laughter)

19
0:01:05.485,000 --> 0:01:07,000
That's what they're actually asking.

20
0:01:07.924,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So when mathematicians are asked what math is for,

21
0:01:12.124,000 --> 0:01:14,000
they tend to fall into two groups:

22
0:01:14.404,000 --> 0:01:19,000
54.51 percent of mathematicians will assume an attacking position,

23
0:01:20.609,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and 44.77 percent of mathematicians will take a defensive position.

24
0:01:25.559,000 --> 0:01:28,000
There's a strange 0.8 percent, among which I include myself.

25
0:01:29.068,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Who are the ones that attack?

26
0:01:31.155,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The attacking ones are mathematicians who would tell you

27
0:01:33.902,000 --> 0:01:34,000
this question makes no sense,

28
0:01:35.849,000 --> 0:01:37,000
because mathematics have a meaning all their own --

29
0:01:38.597,000 --> 0:01:4,000
a beautiful edifice with its own logic --

30
0:01:41.144,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and that there's no point

31
0:01:43.011,000 --> 0:01:45,000
in constantly searching for all possible applications.

32
0:01:45.558,000 --> 0:01:47,000
What's the use of poetry? What's the use of love?

33
0:01:47.847,000 --> 0:01:5,000
What's the use of life itself? What kind of question is that?

34
0:01:50.908,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:52.529,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Hardy, for instance, was a model of this type of attack.

36
0:01:56.296,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And those who stand in defense tell you,

37
0:01:58.242,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"Even if you don't realize it, friend, math is behind everything."

38
0:02:03.082,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:04.34,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Those guys,

40
0:02:06.218,000 --> 0:02:1,000
they always bring up bridges and computers.

41
0:02:10.246,000 --> 0:02:12,000
"If you don't know math, your bridge will collapse."

42
0:02:12.841,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:14.286,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It's true, computers are all about math.

44
0:02:17.523,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And now these guys have also started saying

45
0:02:20.013,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that behind information security and credit cards are prime numbers.

46
0:02:25.71,000 --> 0:02:28,000
These are the answers your math teacher would give you if you asked him.

47
0:02:29.379,000 --> 0:02:31,000
He's one of the defensive ones.

48
0:02:31.544,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Okay, but who's right then?

49
0:02:33.384,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Those who say that math doesn't need to have a purpose,

50
0:02:35.99,000 --> 0:02:37,000
or those who say that math is behind everything we do?

51
0:02:38.849,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Actually, both are right.

52
0:02:40.52,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But remember I told you

53
0:02:42.183,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I belong to that strange 0.8 percent claiming something else?

54
0:02:45.726,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So, go ahead, ask me what math is for.

55
0:02:48.929,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Audience: What is math for?

56
0:02:51.858,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Eduardo Sáenz de Cabezón: Okay, 76.34 percent of you asked the question,

57
0:02:56.673,000 --> 0:02:58,000
23.41 percent didn't say anything,

58
0:02:59.6,000 --> 0:03:,000
and the 0.8 percent --

59
0:03:00.827,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I'm not sure what those guys are doing.

60
0:03:03.675,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Well, to my dear 76.31 percent --

61
0:03:07.175,000 --> 0:03:11,000
it's true that math doesn't need to serve a purpose,

62
0:03:11.815,000 --> 0:03:13,000
it's true that it's a beautiful structure, a logical one,

63
0:03:14.685,000 --> 0:03:16,000
probably one of the greatest collective efforts

64
0:03:17.537,000 --> 0:03:19,000
ever achieved in human history.

65
0:03:19.633,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But it's also true that there,

66
0:03:21.732,000 --> 0:03:25,000
where scientists and technicians are looking for mathematical theories

67
0:03:26.331,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that allow them to advance,

68
0:03:28.641,000 --> 0:03:31,000
they're within the structure of math, which permeates everything.

69
0:03:32.438,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It's true that we have to go somewhat deeper,

70
0:03:35.585,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to see what's behind science.

71
0:03:37.308,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Science operates on intuition, creativity.

72
0:03:41.348,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Math controls intuition and tames creativity.

73
0:03:45.747,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Almost everyone who hasn't heard this before

74
0:03:47.937,000 --> 0:03:49,000
is surprised when they hear that if you take

75
0:03:50.647,000 --> 0:03:54,000
a 0.1 millimeter thick sheet of paper, the size we normally use,

76
0:03:55.187,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and, if it were big enough, fold it 50 times,

77
0:03:58.505,000 --> 0:04:03,000
its thickness would extend almost the distance from the Earth to the sun.

78
0:04:04.6,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Your intuition tells you it's impossible.

79
0:04:07.201,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Do the math and you'll see it's right.

80
0:04:09.622,000 --> 0:04:11,000
That's what math is for.

81
0:04:12.135,000 --> 0:04:15,000
It's true that science, all types of science, only makes sense

82
0:04:15.917,000 --> 0:04:18,000
because it makes us better understand this beautiful world we live in.

83
0:04:19.288,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And in doing that,

84
0:04:20.669,000 --> 0:04:23,000
it helps us avoid the pitfalls of this painful world we live in.

85
0:04:24.179,000 --> 0:04:27,000
There are sciences that help us in this way quite directly.

86
0:04:27.657,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Oncological science, for example.

87
0:04:29.413,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And there are others we look at from afar, with envy sometimes,

88
0:04:32.904,000 --> 0:04:34,000
but knowing that we are what supports them.

89
0:04:35.464,000 --> 0:04:37,000
All the basic sciences support them,

90
0:04:38.213,000 --> 0:04:4,000
including math.

91
0:04:40.649,000 --> 0:04:43,000
All that makes science, science is the rigor of math.

92
0:04:44.366,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And that rigor factors in because its results are eternal.

93
0:04:49.242,000 --> 0:04:51,000
You probably said or were told at some point

94
0:04:51.757,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that diamonds are forever, right?

95
0:04:56.178,000 --> 0:04:58,000
That depends on your definition of forever!

96
0:04:58.392,000 --> 0:05:,000
A theorem -- that really is forever.

97
0:05:00.883,000 --> 0:05:01,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:02.134,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The Pythagorean theorem is still true

99
0:05:05.486,000 --> 0:05:08,000
even though Pythagoras is dead, I assure you it's true. (Laughter)

100
0:05:08.601,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Even if the world collapsed

101
0:05:09.946,000 --> 0:05:11,000
the Pythagorean theorem would still be true.

102
0:05:12.391,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Wherever any two triangle sides and a good hypotenuse get together

103
0:05:16.452,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:17.673,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the Pythagorean theorem goes all out. It works like crazy.

105
0:05:20.534,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Applause)

106
0:05:27.535,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Well, we mathematicians devote ourselves to come up with theorems.

107
0:05:31.407,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Eternal truths.

108
0:05:33.143,000 --> 0:05:35,000
But it isn't always easy to know the difference between

109
0:05:35.909,000 --> 0:05:37,000
an eternal truth, or theorem, and a mere conjecture.

110
0:05:38.815,000 --> 0:05:41,000
You need proof.

111
0:05:41.829,000 --> 0:05:42,000
For example,

112
0:05:43.596,000 --> 0:05:47,000
let's say I have a big, enormous, infinite field.

113
0:05:48.423,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I want to cover it with equal pieces, without leaving any gaps.

114
0:05:52.132,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I could use squares, right?

115
0:05:54.256,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I could use triangles. Not circles, those leave little gaps.

116
0:05:58.777,000 --> 0:06:,000
Which is the best shape to use?

117
0:06:01.134,000 --> 0:06:05,000
One that covers the same surface, but has a smaller border.

118
0:06:05.687,000 --> 0:06:09,000
In the year 300, Pappus of Alexandria said the best is to use hexagons,

119
0:06:10.396,000 --> 0:06:11,000
just like bees do.

120
0:06:12.243,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But he didn't prove it.

121
0:06:13.99,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The guy said, "Hexagons, great! Let's go with hexagons!"

122
0:06:16.688,000 --> 0:06:18,000
He didn't prove it, it remained a conjecture.

123
0:06:19.656,000 --> 0:06:2,000
"Hexagons!"

124
0:06:21.334,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And the world, as you know, split into Pappists and anti-Pappists,

125
0:06:24.964,000 --> 0:06:29,000
until 1700 years later

126
0:06:30.253,000 --> 0:06:35,000
when in 1999, Thomas Hales proved

127
0:06:35.707,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that Pappus and the bees were right -- the best shape to use was the hexagon.

128
0:06:40.641,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And that became a theorem, the honeycomb theorem,

129
0:06:43.123,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that will be true forever and ever,

130
0:06:45.183,000 --> 0:06:48,000
for longer than any diamond you may have. (Laughter)

131
0:06:48.229,000 --> 0:06:5,000
But what happens if we go to three dimensions?

132
0:06:51.033,000 --> 0:06:54,000
If I want to fill the space with equal pieces,

133
0:06:55.464,000 --> 0:06:56,000
without leaving any gaps,

134
0:06:56.805,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I can use cubes, right?

135
0:06:58.638,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Not spheres, those leave little gaps. (Laughter)

136
0:07:01.994,000 --> 0:07:03,000
What is the best shape to use?

137
0:07:04.957,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Lord Kelvin, of the famous Kelvin degrees and all,

138
0:07:09.607,000 --> 0:07:14,000
said that the best was to use a truncated octahedron

139
0:07:16.791,000 --> 0:07:18,000
which, as you all know --

140
0:07:19.507,000 --> 0:07:2,000
(Laughter) --

141
0:07:21.035,000 --> 0:07:22,000
is this thing here!

142
0:07:22.814,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Applause)

143
0:07:27.778,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Come on.

144
0:07:30.025,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Who doesn't have a truncated octahedron at home? (Laughter)

145
0:07:32.862,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Even a plastic one.

146
0:07:34.089,000 --> 0:07:36,000
"Honey, get the truncated octahedron, we're having guests."

147
0:07:36.846,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Everybody has one! (Laughter)

148
0:07:38.24,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But Kelvin didn't prove it.

149
0:07:40.614,000 --> 0:07:44,000
It remained a conjecture -- Kelvin's conjecture.

150
0:07:44.655,000 --> 0:07:49,000
The world, as you know, then split into Kelvinists and anti-Kelvinists

151
0:07:50.177,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Laughter)

152
0:07:51.599,000 --> 0:07:54,000
until a hundred or so years later,

153
0:07:58.203,000 --> 0:08:01,000
someone found a better structure.

154
0:08:02.917,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Weaire and Phelan found this little thing over here --

155
0:08:08.026,000 --> 0:08:09,000
(Laughter) --

156
0:08:09.665,000 --> 0:08:12,000
this structure to which they gave the very clever name

157
0:08:13.209,000 --> 0:08:15,000
"the Weaire-€“Phelan structure."

158
0:08:15.375,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Laughter)

159
0:08:17.911,000 --> 0:08:19,000
It looks like a strange object, but it isn't so strange,

160
0:08:20.568,000 --> 0:08:21,000
it also exists in nature.

161
0:08:22.239,000 --> 0:08:24,000
It's very interesting that this structure,

162
0:08:24.844,000 --> 0:08:26,000
because of its geometric properties,

163
0:08:27.037,000 --> 0:08:32,000
was used to build the Aquatics Center for the Beijing Olympic Games.

164
0:08:32.969,000 --> 0:08:34,000
There, Michael Phelps won eight gold medals,

165
0:08:35.714,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and became the best swimmer of all time.

166
0:08:38.875,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Well, until someone better comes along, right?

167
0:08:42.616,000 --> 0:08:44,000
As may happen with the Weaire-€“Phelan structure.

168
0:08:45.015,000 --> 0:08:47,000
It's the best until something better shows up.

169
0:08:47.633,000 --> 0:08:51,000
But be careful, because this one really stands a chance

170
0:08:52.225,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that in a hundred or so years, or even if it's in 1700 years,

171
0:08:57.205,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that someone proves it's the best possible shape for the job.

172
0:09:02.978,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It will then become a theorem, a truth, forever and ever.

173
0:09:07.348,000 --> 0:09:09,000
For longer than any diamond.

174
0:09:10.837,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So, if you want to tell someone

175
0:09:15.777,000 --> 0:09:18,000
that you will love them forever

176
0:09:18.823,000 --> 0:09:2,000
you can give them a diamond.

177
0:09:20.89,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But if you want to tell them that you'll love them forever and ever,

178
0:09:24.421,000 --> 0:09:25,000
give them a theorem!

179
0:09:26.172,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Laughter)

180
0:09:27.263,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But hang on a minute!

181
0:09:30.783,000 --> 0:09:31,000
You'll have to prove it,

182
0:09:32.183,000 --> 0:09:34,000
so your love doesn't remain

183
0:09:34.466,000 --> 0:09:35,000
a conjecture.

184
0:09:36.299,000 --> 0:09:39,000
(Applause)

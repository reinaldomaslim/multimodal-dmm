1
0:00:26.396,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I'm often asked,

2
0:00:28.848,000 --> 0:00:3,000
"What surprised you about the book?"

3
0:00:31.32,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And I say, "That I got to write it."

4
0:00:33.501,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I would have never imagined that.

5
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Not in my wildest dreams did I think --

6
0:00:38.904,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I don't even consider myself to be an author.

7
0:00:42.289,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And I'm often asked,

8
0:00:44.511,000 --> 0:00:46,000
"Why do you think so many people have read this?

9
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:5,000
This thing's selling still about a million copies a month."

10
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And I think it's because spiritual emptiness

11
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:59,000
is a universal disease.

12
0:00:59.912,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I think inside at some point, we put our heads down on the pillow and we go,

13
0:01:03.553,000 --> 0:01:05,000
"There's got to be more to life than this."

14
0:01:06.192,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Get up in the morning, go to work, come home and watch TV,

15
0:01:08.957,000 --> 0:01:11,000
go to bed, get up in the morning, go to work, come home, watch TV, go to bed,

16
0:01:12.641,000 --> 0:01:13,000
go to parties on weekends.

17
0:01:15.283,000 --> 0:01:19,000
A lot of people say, "I'm living." No, you're not living -- that's just existing.

18
0:01:19.994,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Just existing.

19
0:01:21.537,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I really think that there's this inner desire.

20
0:01:25.331,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I do believe what Chris said; I believe that you're not an accident.

21
0:01:30.728,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Your parents may not have planned you, but I believe God did.

22
0:01:34.202,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I think there are accidental parents; there's no doubt about that.

23
0:01:37.457,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I don't think there are accidental kids.

24
0:01:40.698,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And I think you matter.

25
0:01:43.536,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I think you matter to God; I think you matter to history;

26
0:01:46.577,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I think you matter to this universe.

27
0:01:49.949,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And I think that the difference

28
0:01:52.196,000 --> 0:01:56,000
between what I call the survival level of living, the success level of living,

29
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and the significance level of living is:

30
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Do you figure out, "What on Earth am I here for?"

31
0:02:02.524,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I meet a lot of people who are very smart,

32
0:02:05.918,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and say, "But why can't I figure out my problems?"

33
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And I meet a lot of people who are very successful,

34
0:02:11.665,000 --> 0:02:13,000
who say, "Why don't I feel more fulfilled?

35
0:02:14.379,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Why do I feel like a fake?

36
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Why do I feel like I've got to pretend that I'm more than I really am?"

37
0:02:23.562,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I think that comes down to this issue of meaning, of significance, of purpose.

38
0:02:27.896,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I think it comes down to this issue of:

39
0:02:30.375,000 --> 0:02:33,000
"Why am I here? What am I here for? Where am I going?"

40
0:02:33.938,000 --> 0:02:35,000
These are not religious issues.

41
0:02:36.779,000 --> 0:02:38,000
They're human issues.

42
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I wanted to tell Michael before he spoke that I really appreciate what he does,

43
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
because it makes my life work a whole lot easier.

44
0:02:47.174,000 --> 0:02:5,000
As a pastor, I do see a lot of kooks.

45
0:02:51.396,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And I have learned that there are kooks in every area of life.

46
0:02:55.444,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Religion doesn't have a monopoly on that,

47
0:02:59.796,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but there are plenty of religious kooks.

48
0:03:01.857,000 --> 0:03:04,000
There are secular kooks; there are smart kooks, dumb kooks.

49
0:03:05.268,000 --> 0:03:07,000
There are people -- a lady came up to me the other day,

50
0:03:07.903,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and she had a white piece of paper -- Michael, you'll like this one --

51
0:03:11.242,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and she said, "What do you see in it?"

52
0:03:13.092,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And I looked at it and I said, "Oh, I don't see anything."

53
0:03:15.856,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And she goes, "Well, I see Jesus," and started crying and left.

54
0:03:18.852,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I'm going, "OK," you know? "Fine."

55
0:03:23.38,000 --> 0:03:25,000
(Laughter)

56
0:03:25.564,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Good for you.

57
0:03:29.45,000 --> 0:03:32,000
When the book became the best-selling book in the world for the last three years,

58
0:03:33.355,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I kind of had my little crisis.

59
0:03:36.386,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And that was: What is the purpose of this?

60
0:03:40.771,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Because it brought in enormous amounts of money.

61
0:03:43.58,000 --> 0:03:45,000
When you write the best-selling book in the world,

62
0:03:46.025,000 --> 0:03:47,000
it's tons and tons of money.

63
0:03:48.894,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And it brought in a lot of attention, neither of which I wanted.

64
0:03:52.193,000 --> 0:03:54,000
When I started Saddleback Church, I was 25 years old.

65
0:03:55.609,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I started it with one other family in 1980.

66
0:04:00.674,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And I decided that I was never going to go on TV,

67
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:04,000
because I didn't want to be a celebrity.

68
0:04:04.946,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I didn't want to be a, quote, "evangelist, televangelist" --

69
0:04:08.151,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that's not my thing.

70
0:04:10.896,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And all of the sudden, it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention.

71
0:04:15.194,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I don't think --

72
0:04:16.758,000 --> 0:04:17,000
now, this is a worldview,

73
0:04:18.023,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and I will tell you, everybody's got a worldview.

74
0:04:21.037,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Everybody's betting their life on something.

75
0:04:23.12,000 --> 0:04:24,000
You're betting your life on something,

76
0:04:24.981,000 --> 0:04:27,000
you just better know why you're betting what you're betting on.

77
0:04:28.409,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So, everybody's betting their life on something.

78
0:04:31.658,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And when I, you know, made a bet,

79
0:04:35.644,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I happened to believe that Jesus was who he said he was.

80
0:04:39.159,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And I believe in a pluralistic society,

81
0:04:42.142,000 --> 0:04:43,000
everybody's betting on something.

82
0:04:45.404,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And when I started the church,

83
0:04:48.526,000 --> 0:04:51,000
you know, I had no plans to do what it's doing now.

84
0:04:53.171,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And then when I wrote this book,

85
0:04:55.052,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and all of a sudden, it just took off,

86
0:04:59.601,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and I started saying, now, what's the purpose of this?

87
0:05:02.212,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Because as I started to say,

88
0:05:03.957,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I don't think you're given money or fame

89
0:05:06.177,000 --> 0:05:07,000
for your own ego, ever.

90
0:05:09.511,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I just don't believe that.

91
0:05:11.371,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And when you write a book that the first sentence of the book is,

92
0:05:14.582,000 --> 0:05:16,000
"It's not about you,"

93
0:05:17.028,000 --> 0:05:2,000
then, when all of a sudden it becomes the best-selling book in history,

94
0:05:20.432,000 --> 0:05:22,000
you've got to figure, well, I guess it's not about me.

95
0:05:23.664,000 --> 0:05:24,000
That's kind of a no-brainer.

96
0:05:26.251,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So, what is it for?

97
0:05:28.743,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And I began to think about what I call the "stewardship of affluence"

98
0:05:32.373,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and the "stewardship of influence."

99
0:05:35.434,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So I believe, essentially, leadership is stewardship.

100
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:41,000
That if you are a leader in any area --

101
0:05:41.449,000 --> 0:05:44,000
in business, in politics, in sports, in art,

102
0:05:44.989,000 --> 0:05:46,000
in academics, in any area --

103
0:05:47.081,000 --> 0:05:48,000
you don't own it.

104
0:05:49.764,000 --> 0:05:5,000
You are a steward of it.

105
0:05:51.909,000 --> 0:05:54,000
For instance, that's why I believe in protecting the environment.

106
0:05:55.004,000 --> 0:05:56,000
This is not my planet.

107
0:05:56.588,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It wasn't mine before I was born, it's not going to be mine after I die,

108
0:06:00.075,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I'm just here for 80 years and then that's it.

109
0:06:03.27,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I was debating the other day on a talk show,

110
0:06:07.391,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and the guy was challenging me and he'd go,

111
0:06:09.428,000 --> 0:06:11,000
"What's a pastor doing on protecting the environment?"

112
0:06:12.856,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And I asked this guy, I said, "Well, do you believe

113
0:06:16.657,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that human beings are responsible

114
0:06:20.564,000 --> 0:06:23,000
to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation?

115
0:06:24.349,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Do you think we have a stewardship here, to take the environment seriously?"

116
0:06:29.334,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And he said, "No."

117
0:06:31.285,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I said, "Oh, you don't?"

118
0:06:32.463,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I said, "Let me make this clear again:

119
0:06:34.312,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Do you believe that as human beings -- I'm not talking about religion --

120
0:06:38.282,000 --> 0:06:4,000
do you believe that as human beings, it is our responsibility

121
0:06:41.178,000 --> 0:06:42,000
to take care of this planet,

122
0:06:42.544,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and make it just a little bit better for the next generation?"

123
0:06:45.491,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And he said, "No. Not any more than any other species."

124
0:06:50.2,000 --> 0:06:53,000
When he said the word "species," he was revealing his worldview.

125
0:06:54.382,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And he was saying,

126
0:06:55.6,000 --> 0:06:59,000
"I'm no more responsible to take care of this environment than a duck is."

127
0:07:00.887,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Well now, I know a lot of times we act like ducks,

128
0:07:03.501,000 --> 0:07:04,000
but you're not a duck.

129
0:07:05.635,000 --> 0:07:06,000
You're not a duck.

130
0:07:07.543,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And you are responsible -- that's my worldview.

131
0:07:11.397,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And so, you need to understand what your worldview is.

132
0:07:15.696,000 --> 0:07:18,000
The problem is most people never really think it through.

133
0:07:19.783,000 --> 0:07:22,000
They never really ...

134
0:07:23.746,000 --> 0:07:26,000
codify it or qualify it or quantify it,

135
0:07:27.103,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and say, "This is what I believe in. This is why I believe what I believe."

136
0:07:31.209,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I don't personally have enough faith to be an atheist.

137
0:07:35.159,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But you may, you may.

138
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Your worldview, though, does determine everything else in your life,

139
0:07:42.113,000 --> 0:07:44,000
because it determines your decisions;

140
0:07:44.859,000 --> 0:07:46,000
it determines your relationships;

141
0:07:47.272,000 --> 0:07:49,000
it determines your level of confidence.

142
0:07:50.082,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It determines, really, everything in your life.

143
0:07:53.277,000 --> 0:07:54,000
What we believe, obviously --

144
0:07:55.078,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and you know this -- determines our behavior,

145
0:07:57.809,000 --> 0:08:,000
and our behavior determines what we become in life.

146
0:08:03.912,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So all of this money started pouring in,

147
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and all of this fame started pouring in.

148
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And I'm going, what do I do with this?

149
0:08:13.539,000 --> 0:08:16,000
My wife and I first made five decisions on what to do with the money.

150
0:08:18.081,000 --> 0:08:21,000
We said, "First, we're not going to use it on ourselves."

151
0:08:22.75,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I didn't go out and buy a bigger house.

152
0:08:25.099,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I don't own a guesthouse.

153
0:08:26.898,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I still drive the same four year-old Ford that I've driven.

154
0:08:30.619,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We just said, we're not going to use it on us.

155
0:08:33.659,000 --> 0:08:35,000
The second thing was,

156
0:08:36.354,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I stopped taking a salary from the church that I pastor.

157
0:08:40.282,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Third thing is, I added up all that the church had paid me

158
0:08:43.045,000 --> 0:08:45,000
over the last 25 years, and I gave it back.

159
0:08:46.71,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And I gave it back because I didn't want anybody thinking

160
0:08:49.424,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that I do what I do for money -- I don't.

161
0:08:51.756,000 --> 0:08:54,000
In fact, personally, I've never met

162
0:08:55.424,000 --> 0:08:58,000
a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money.

163
0:08:58.84,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I know that's the stereotype; I've never met one of them.

164
0:09:01.919,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Believe me, there's a whole lot easier ways to make money.

165
0:09:05.763,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Pastors are like on 24 hours-a-day call, they're like doctors.

166
0:09:09.605,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I left late today -- I'd hoped to be here yesterday --

167
0:09:13.073,000 --> 0:09:16,000
because my father-in-law is in his last, probably, 48 hours

168
0:09:16.547,000 --> 0:09:17,000
before he dies of cancer.

169
0:09:18.286,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And I'm watching a guy who's lived his life --

170
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:24,000
he's now in his mid-80s -- and he's dying with peace.

171
0:09:24.98,000 --> 0:09:29,000
You know, the test of your worldview is not how you act in the good times.

172
0:09:30.555,000 --> 0:09:33,000
The test of your worldview is how you act at the funeral.

173
0:09:35.352,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals,

174
0:09:39.394,000 --> 0:09:4,000
it makes a difference.

175
0:09:41.171,000 --> 0:09:43,000
It makes a difference what you believe.

176
0:09:44.509,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So, we gave it all back,

177
0:09:48.398,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and then we set up three foundations,

178
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
working on some of the major problems of the world:

179
0:09:53.681,000 --> 0:09:58,000
illiteracy, poverty, pandemic diseases -- particularly HIV/AIDS --

180
0:09:59.555,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and set up these three foundations, and put the money into that.

181
0:10:03.757,000 --> 0:10:06,000
The last thing we did is we became what I call "reverse tithers."

182
0:10:07.535,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And that is, when my wife and I got married 30 years ago,

183
0:10:15.071,000 --> 0:10:17,000
we started tithing.

184
0:10:17.939,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Now, that's a principle in the Bible

185
0:10:20.052,000 --> 0:10:23,000
that says give 10 percent of what you get back to charity,

186
0:10:23.159,000 --> 0:10:24,000
give it away to help other people.

187
0:10:25.865,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So, we started doing that, and each year we would raise our tithe one percent.

188
0:10:29.885,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So, our first year of marriage we went to 11 percent,

189
0:10:32.407,000 --> 0:10:33,000
second year we went to 12 percent,

190
0:10:34.068,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and the third year we went to 13 percent,

191
0:10:36.838,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and on and on and on.

192
0:10:39.339,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Why did I do that?

193
0:10:40.569,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Because every time I give,

194
0:10:42.185,000 --> 0:10:44,000
it breaks the grip of materialism in my life.

195
0:10:46.217,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Materialism is all about getting -- get, get, get, get all you can,

196
0:10:50.845,000 --> 0:10:52,000
can all you get, sit on the can and spoil the rest.

197
0:10:54.599,000 --> 0:10:57,000
It's all about more, having more.

198
0:10:58.539,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And we think that the good life is actually looking good --

199
0:11:02.658,000 --> 0:11:03,000
that's most important of all --

200
0:11:04.173,000 --> 0:11:07,000
looking good, feeling good and having the goods.

201
0:11:08.754,000 --> 0:11:09,000
But that's not the good life.

202
0:11:10.532,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I meet people all the time who have those, and they're not necessarily happy.

203
0:11:14.768,000 --> 0:11:16,000
If money actually made you happy,

204
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:19,000
then the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest.

205
0:11:19.977,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And that I know, personally, I know, is not true.

206
0:11:22.883,000 --> 0:11:23,000
It's just not true.

207
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:28,000
So, the good life is not about looking good, feeling good or having the goods,

208
0:11:28.855,000 --> 0:11:3,000
it's about being good and doing good.

209
0:11:32.102,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Giving your life away.

210
0:11:34.579,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Significance in life doesn't come from status,

211
0:11:38.271,000 --> 0:11:4,000
because you can always find somebody who's got more than you.

212
0:11:41.178,000 --> 0:11:42,000
It doesn't come from sex.

213
0:11:42.718,000 --> 0:11:43,000
It doesn't come from salary.

214
0:11:45.304,000 --> 0:11:46,000
It comes from serving.

215
0:11:47.658,000 --> 0:11:49,000
It is in giving our lives away that we find meaning,

216
0:11:50.403,000 --> 0:11:51,000
we find significance.

217
0:11:52.49,000 --> 0:11:55,000
That's the way we were wired, I believe, by God.

218
0:11:57,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And so we began to give away,

219
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and now after 30 years,

220
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:05,000
my wife and I are reverse tithers -- we give away 90 percent and live on 10.

221
0:12:07.055,000 --> 0:12:08,000
That, actually, was the easy part.

222
0:12:08.949,000 --> 0:12:1,000
The hard part is, what do I do with all this attention?

223
0:12:12.162,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Because I started getting all kinds of invitations.

224
0:12:15.327,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I just came off a nearly month-long speaking tour

225
0:12:19.288,000 --> 0:12:2,000
on three different continents,

226
0:12:21.117,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and I won't go into that,

227
0:12:23.831,000 --> 0:12:24,000
but it was an amazing thing.

228
0:12:26.452,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And I'm going, what do I do with this notoriety

229
0:12:30.347,000 --> 0:12:31,000
that the book has brought?

230
0:12:32.801,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And, being a pastor, I started reading the Bible.

231
0:12:36.61,000 --> 0:12:38,000
There's a chapter in the Bible called Psalm 72,

232
0:12:39.403,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and it's Solomon's prayer for more influence.

233
0:12:43.172,000 --> 0:12:44,000
When you read this prayer,

234
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:48,000
it sounds incredibly selfish, self-centered.

235
0:12:49.023,000 --> 0:12:51,000
He says, "God, I want you to make me famous."

236
0:12:51.583,000 --> 0:12:52,000
That's what he prays.

237
0:12:53.047,000 --> 0:12:54,000
He said, "I want you to make me famous.

238
0:12:54.938,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I want you to spread the fame of my name through every land,

239
0:12:57.795,000 --> 0:13:,000
I want you to give me power.

240
0:13:01.13,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I want you to make me famous, I want you to give me influence."

241
0:13:04.769,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make,

242
0:13:08.024,000 --> 0:13:09,000
if you were going to pray.

243
0:13:10.444,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Until you read the whole psalm, the whole chapter.

244
0:13:13.117,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And then he says, "So that the king ..." --

245
0:13:15.759,000 --> 0:13:19,000
he was the king of Israel at that time, at its apex in power --

246
0:13:20.57,000 --> 0:13:23,000
"... so that the king may care for the widow and orphan,

247
0:13:24.333,000 --> 0:13:28,000
support the oppressed, defend the defenseless, care for the sick,

248
0:13:28.361,000 --> 0:13:31,000
assist the poor, speak up for the foreigner,

249
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:33,000
those in prison."

250
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Basically, he's talking about all the marginalized in society.

251
0:13:37.757,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And as I read that,

252
0:13:39.37,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I looked at it, and I thought, you know,

253
0:13:42.824,000 --> 0:13:45,000
what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up

254
0:13:46.795,000 --> 0:13:48,000
for those who have no influence.

255
0:13:50.763,000 --> 0:13:52,000
The purpose of influence is not to build your ego.

256
0:13:55.992,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Or your net worth.

257
0:13:57.168,000 --> 0:14:,000
And, by the way, your net worth is not the same thing as your self-worth.

258
0:14:00.844,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Your value is not based on your valuables.

259
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:08,000
It's based on a whole different set of things.

260
0:14:08.732,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And so the purpose of influence is to speak up

261
0:14:11.861,000 --> 0:14:12,000
for those who have no influence.

262
0:14:13.425,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And I had to admit:

263
0:14:15.363,000 --> 0:14:18,000
I can't think of the last time I thought of widows and orphans.

264
0:14:18.413,000 --> 0:14:2,000
They're not on my radar.

265
0:14:21.261,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of America --

266
0:14:24.473,000 --> 0:14:25,000
a bunch of gated communities.

267
0:14:26.354,000 --> 0:14:28,000
I have a church full of CEOs and scientists.

268
0:14:30.64,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And I could go five years and never, ever see a homeless person.

269
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:36,000
They're just not in my pathway.

270
0:14:37.379,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Now, they're 13 miles up the road in Santa Ana.

271
0:14:41.867,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So I had to say, ok,

272
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:47,000
I would use whatever affluence and whatever influence I've got

273
0:14:47.809,000 --> 0:14:5,000
to help those who don't have either of those.

274
0:14:52.61,000 --> 0:14:54,000
You know, there's a story in the Bible about Moses,

275
0:14:55.365,000 --> 0:14:58,000
whether you believe it's true or not, it really doesn't matter to me.

276
0:14:58.968,000 --> 0:15:,000
But Moses, if you saw the movie, "The Ten Commandments,"

277
0:15:01.632,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Moses goes out, and there's this burning bush, and God talks to him,

278
0:15:04.939,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and God says, "Moses, what's in your hand?"

279
0:15:10.261,000 --> 0:15:13,000
I think that's one of the most important questions you'll ever be asked:

280
0:15:14.126,000 --> 0:15:15,000
What's in your hand?

281
0:15:16.416,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Moses says, "It's a staff. It's a shepherd's staff."

282
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And God says, "Throw it down."

283
0:15:22.89,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And if you saw the movie, you know, he throws it down and it becomes a snake.

284
0:15:29.23,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And then God says, "Pick it up."

285
0:15:32.152,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And he picks it back up again,

286
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and it becomes a staff again.

287
0:15:37.357,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Now, I'm reading this thing, and I'm going, what is that all about?

288
0:15:41.143,000 --> 0:15:44,000
OK. What's that all about? Well, I do know a couple of things.

289
0:15:44.48,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Number one, God never does a miracle to show off.

290
0:15:48.091,000 --> 0:15:5,000
It's not just, "Wow, isn't that cool?"

291
0:15:50.158,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And, by the way, my God doesn't have to show up on cheese bread.

292
0:15:53.881,000 --> 0:15:56,000
You know, if God's going to show up, he's not going to show up on cheese bread.

293
0:15:57.8,000 --> 0:15:58,000
(Laughter)

294
0:15:59.017,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Ok? I just, this is why I love what Michael does,

295
0:16:01.916,000 --> 0:16:05,000
because it's like, if he's debunking it, then I don't have to.

296
0:16:06.598,000 --> 0:16:09,000
But God -- my God -- doesn't show up on sprinkler images.

297
0:16:10.76,000 --> 0:16:14,000
He's got a few more powerful ways than that to do whatever he wants to do.

298
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:18,000
But he doesn't do miracles just to show off.

299
0:16:18.106,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Second thing is, if God ever asks you a question,

300
0:16:20.429,000 --> 0:16:21,000
he already knows the answer.

301
0:16:22.682,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Obviously, if he's God, then that would mean

302
0:16:24.923,000 --> 0:16:27,000
that when he asks the question, it's for your benefit, not his.

303
0:16:28.627,000 --> 0:16:29,000
So he's going, "What's in your hand?"

304
0:16:30.512,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Now, what was in Moses' hand?

305
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Well, it was a shepherd's staff. Now, follow me on this.

306
0:16:36.037,000 --> 0:16:39,000
This staff represented three things about Moses' life.

307
0:16:39.466,000 --> 0:16:42,000
First, it represented his identity; he was a shepherd.

308
0:16:43.029,000 --> 0:16:46,000
It's the symbol of his own occupation:

309
0:16:46.352,000 --> 0:16:47,000
I am a shepherd.

310
0:16:48.219,000 --> 0:16:5,000
It's a symbol of his identity, his career, his job.

311
0:16:51.369,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Second, it's a symbol of not only his identity,

312
0:16:54.543,000 --> 0:16:58,000
it's a symbol of his income, because all of his assets are tied up in sheep.

313
0:16:58.722,000 --> 0:17:02,000
In those days, nobody had bank accounts, or American Express cards, or hedge funds.

314
0:17:03.143,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Your assets are tied up in your flocks.

315
0:17:06.277,000 --> 0:17:09,000
So it's a symbol of his identity, and it's a symbol of his income.

316
0:17:09.983,000 --> 0:17:11,000
And the third thing: it's a symbol of his influence.

317
0:17:13.348,000 --> 0:17:16,000
What do you do with a shepherd's staff?

318
0:17:16.679,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Well, you know, you move sheep from point A to point B with it,

319
0:17:20.456,000 --> 0:17:21,000
by hook or by crook.

320
0:17:22.121,000 --> 0:17:25,000
You pull them or you poke them. One or the other.

321
0:17:26.405,000 --> 0:17:27,000
So, he's saying,

322
0:17:28.357,000 --> 0:17:3,000
"You're going to lay down your identity.

323
0:17:30.42,000 --> 0:17:31,000
What's in your hand?

324
0:17:31.599,000 --> 0:17:33,000
You've got identity, you've got income, you've got influence.

325
0:17:34.496,000 --> 0:17:35,000
What's in your hand?"

326
0:17:36.498,000 --> 0:17:38,000
And he's saying, "If you lay it down, I'll make it come alive.

327
0:17:39.451,000 --> 0:17:41,000
I'll do some things you could never imagine possible."

328
0:17:42.05,000 --> 0:17:44,000
And if you've watched that movie, "Ten Commandments,"

329
0:17:44.568,000 --> 0:17:48,000
all of those big miracles that happen in Egypt are done through this staff.

330
0:17:51.152,000 --> 0:17:56,000
Last year, I was invited to speak at the NBA All-Stars game.

331
0:17:56.94,000 --> 0:17:59,000
And so, I'm talking to the players,

332
0:18:,000 --> 0:18:04,000
because most of the NBA teams, NFL teams and all the other teams

333
0:18:04.325,000 --> 0:18:06,000
have done this 40 Days of Purpose, based on the book.

334
0:18:07.508,000 --> 0:18:1,000
And I asked them, I said, "What's in your hand?

335
0:18:12.392,000 --> 0:18:15,000
So, what's in your hand?" I said, "It's a basketball.

336
0:18:16.411,000 --> 0:18:19,000
And that basketball represents your identity, who you are:

337
0:18:20.152,000 --> 0:18:21,000
you're an NBA player.

338
0:18:21.65,000 --> 0:18:22,000
It represents your income:

339
0:18:23.246,000 --> 0:18:25,000
you're making a lot of money off that little ball.

340
0:18:26.182,000 --> 0:18:27,000
And it represents your influence.

341
0:18:28.645,000 --> 0:18:31,000
And even though you're only going to be in the NBA for a few years,

342
0:18:31.976,000 --> 0:18:33,000
you're going to be an NBA player for the rest of your life.

343
0:18:34.787,000 --> 0:18:36,000
And that gives you enormous influence.

344
0:18:37.254,000 --> 0:18:4,000
So, what are you going to do with what you've been given?"

345
0:18:41.785,000 --> 0:18:45,000
And I guess that's the main reason I came up here today,

346
0:18:46.298,000 --> 0:18:48,000
to all of you very bright people at TED --

347
0:18:49.251,000 --> 0:18:5,000
it is to say, "What's in your hand?"

348
0:18:53.156,000 --> 0:18:56,000
What do you have that you've been given?

349
0:18:57.606,000 --> 0:19:,000
Talent, background, education,

350
0:19:01,000 --> 0:19:05,000
freedom, networks, opportunities,

351
0:19:05.183,000 --> 0:19:08,000
wealth, ideas, creativity.

352
0:19:08.75,000 --> 0:19:12,000
What are you doing with what you've been given?

353
0:19:12.823,000 --> 0:19:15,000
That, to me, is the primary question about life.

354
0:19:16.737,000 --> 0:19:19,000
That, to me, is what being purpose-driven is all about.

355
0:19:20.999,000 --> 0:19:23,000
In the book, I talk about how you're wired to do certain things,

356
0:19:24.227,000 --> 0:19:27,000
you're "SHAPED" with -- a little acrostic: Spiritual gifts, Heart,

357
0:19:27.92,000 --> 0:19:29,000
Ability, Personality and Experiences.

358
0:19:30.332,000 --> 0:19:31,000
These things shape you.

359
0:19:32.42,000 --> 0:19:35,000
And if you want to know what you ought to be doing with your life,

360
0:19:35.568,000 --> 0:19:37,000
you need to look at your shape -- "What am I wired to do?"

361
0:19:38.329,000 --> 0:19:41,000
Why would God wire you to do something and then not have you do it?

362
0:19:41.671,000 --> 0:19:44,000
If you're wired to be an anthropologist, you'll be an anthropologist.

363
0:19:44.943,000 --> 0:19:46,000
If you're wired to be an undersea explorer,

364
0:19:46.975,000 --> 0:19:47,000
you'll be an undersea explorer.

365
0:19:48.491,000 --> 0:19:5,000
If you're wired to make deals, you make deals.

366
0:19:50.681,000 --> 0:19:51,000
If you're wired to paint, you paint.

367
0:19:53.355,000 --> 0:19:55,000
Did you know that God smiles when you be you?

368
0:19:57.574,000 --> 0:19:59,000
When my little kids -- when my kids were little --

369
0:19:59.945,000 --> 0:20:01,000
they're all grown now, I have grandkids --

370
0:20:01.976,000 --> 0:20:03,000
I used to go in and sit on the side of their bed,

371
0:20:04.312,000 --> 0:20:05,000
and I used to watch my kids sleep.

372
0:20:07.152,000 --> 0:20:12,000
And I just watched their little bodies rise and lower, rise and lower.

373
0:20:12.622,000 --> 0:20:14,000
And I would look at them: "This is not an accident."

374
0:20:15.501,000 --> 0:20:16,000
Rise and lower.

375
0:20:18.247,000 --> 0:20:21,000
And I got joy out of just watching them sleep.

376
0:20:24,000 --> 0:20:27,000
Some people have the misguided idea that God only gets excited

377
0:20:27.591,000 --> 0:20:29,000
when you're doing, quote, "spiritual things,"

378
0:20:29.735,000 --> 0:20:31,000
like going to church or helping the poor,

379
0:20:32.472,000 --> 0:20:35,000
or, you know, confessing or doing something like that.

380
0:20:36.42,000 --> 0:20:4,000
The bottom line is, God gets pleasure watching you be you.

381
0:20:40.802,000 --> 0:20:41,000
Why? He made you.

382
0:20:42.89,000 --> 0:20:44,000
And when you do what you were made to do,

383
0:20:45.311,000 --> 0:20:49,000
he goes, "That's my boy! That's my girl!

384
0:20:49.382,000 --> 0:20:52,000
You're using the talent and ability that I gave you."

385
0:20:53.513,000 --> 0:20:54,000
So my advice to you is:

386
0:20:55.417,000 --> 0:20:56,000
look at what's in your hand --

387
0:20:57.171,000 --> 0:21:,000
your identity, your influence, your income --

388
0:21:01.861,000 --> 0:21:03,000
and say, "It's not about me.

389
0:21:04.388,000 --> 0:21:07,000
It's about making the world a better place."

390
0:21:08.434,000 --> 0:21:09,000
Thank you.

0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Hello. Actually, that's "hello" in Bauer Bodoni

2
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:33,000
for the typographically hysterical amongst us.

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
One of the threads that seems to have come through

4
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
loud and clear in the last couple of days

5
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:43,000
is this need to reconcile what the Big wants --

6
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:49,000
the "Big" being the organization, the system, the country --

7
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and what the "Small" wants -- the individual, the person.

8
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And how do you bring those two things together?

9
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Charlie Ledbetter, yesterday, I thought, talked very articulately

10
0:00:56,000 --> 0:01:,000
about this need to bring consumers, to bring people

11
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:02,000
into the process of creating things.

12
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And that's what I want to talk about today.

13
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So, bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big,

14
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I think, is something that we believe in -- something I believe in,

15
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and something that we kind of bring to life

16
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
through what we do at Ideo.

17
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I call this first chapter -- for the Brits in the room --

18
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the "Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious."

19
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Often, the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face

20
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that you kind of miss them. And I think, a lot of times,

21
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:33,000
what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go,

22
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
"Duh! You know, look what's really going on."

23
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And rather than talk about it in the theory,

24
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I think I'm just going to show you an example.

25
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota

26
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to describe to them what their patient experience was.

27
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And I think they were expecting --

28
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:51,000
they'd worked with lots of consultants before --

29
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart

30
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:58,000
with thousands of bubbles and systemic this, that and the other,

31
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:,000
and all kinds of mappy stuff.

32
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Or even worse, some kind of ghastly death-by-Powerpoint thing

33
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:08,000
with WowCharts and all kinds of, you know, God knows, whatever.

34
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:14,000
The first thing we actually shared with them was this.

35
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve.

36
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:24,000
This is 59 seconds into the film.

37
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:29,000
This is a minute 59.

38
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:3,000
3:19.

39
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I think something happens. I think a head may appear in a second.

40
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:36,000
5:10.

41
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:38,000
5:58.

42
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:4,000
6:20.

43
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We showed them the whole cut,

44
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and they were all completely, what is this?

45
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day,

46
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:59,000
all you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience.

47
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And just putting yourself in the position of the patient --

48
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:05,000
this is Christian, who works with us at Ideo.

49
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:06,000
He just lay in the hospital bed,

50
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and, kind of, stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles

51
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:1,000
for a really long time.

52
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:13,000
That's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital.

53
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.

54
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Oh, my goodness. So, looking at the situation

55
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:22,000
from the point of view of the person out --

56
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:26,000
as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in --

57
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
was, for these guys, quite a revelation.

58
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And so, that was a really catalytic thing for them.

59
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So they snapped into action.

60
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:37,000
They said, OK, it's not about systemic change.

61
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do.

62
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:42,000
It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference.

63
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So we started with them prototyping some really little things

64
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that we could do to have a huge amount of impact.

65
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:52,000
The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror

66
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley,

67
0:03:57,000 --> 0:04:01,000
so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor,

68
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:02,000
you could actually have a conversation with them.

69
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:04,000
You could, kind of, see them in your rear-view mirror,

70
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:07,000
so it created a tiny human interaction.

71
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Very small example of something that they could do.

72
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Interestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action --

73
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
said, OK, we embrace this. What can we do?

74
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling.

75
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Which I thought was really -- I showed this to my mother recently.

76
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator.

77
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It's what I do for a living, sort of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.

78
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Not particularly the world's best design solution

79
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:31,000
for those of us who are real, sort of, hard-core designers,

80
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but nonetheless, a fabulous empathic solution for people.

81
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Things that they started doing themselves --

82
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:42,000
like changing the floor going into the patient's room

83
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:47,000
so that it signified, "This is my room. This is my personal space" --

84
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:49,000
was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem.

85
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So you went from public space to private space.

86
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses -- which I love --

87
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:58,000
was they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards,

88
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:,000
then they put them on one wall of the patient's room,

89
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and they put this sticker there.

90
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So that what you could actually do was go into the room

91
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and write messages to the person who was sick in that room,

92
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:09,000
which was lovely.

93
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact.

94
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I thought that was a really, really nice example.

95
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So this is not particularly a new idea,

96
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:24,000
kind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you

97
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and snapping and turning them into a solution.

98
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It's a history of invention based around this.

99
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I'm going to read this because I want to get these names right.

100
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Joan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter -- came down on a Saturday morning,

101
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:37,000
saw her daughter watching the test card,

102
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:4,000
waiting for programs to come on one morning

103
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and from that came Sesame Street.

104
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Malcolm McLean was moving from one country to another

105
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and was wondering why it took these guys so long

106
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to get the boxes onto the ship.

107
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And he invented the shipping container.

108
0:05:56,000 --> 0:06:,000
George de Mestral -- this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock --

109
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:03,000
was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs,

110
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:1,000
sort of little prickly things, and from that came Velcro.

111
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And finally, for the Brits, Percy Shaw -- this is a big British invention --

112
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:16,000
saw the cat's eyes at the side of the road,

113
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
when he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye.

114
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So there's a whole series of just using your eyes,

115
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:26,000
seeing things for the first time, seeing things afresh

116
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities.

117
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Second one, without sounding overly Zen,

118
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and this is a quote from the Buddha:

119
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:38,000
"Finding yourself in the margins, looking to the edges of things,

120
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
is often a really interesting place to start."

121
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Blinkered vision tends to produce, I think, blinkered solutions.

122
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So, looking wide, using your peripheral vision,

123
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:51,000
is a really interesting place to look for opportunity.

124
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Again, another medical example here.

125
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:57,000
We were asked by a device producer --

126
0:06:57,000 --> 0:06:59,000
we did the Palm Pilot and the Treo.

127
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo --

128
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:04,000
they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology

129
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:06,000
for medical diagnostics.

130
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:08,000
This was a device that a nurse uses

131
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:1,000
when they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital.

132
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:12,000
They'll ask the nurses to input data.

133
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And they had this vision of the nurse, kind of, clicking away

134
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:15,000
on this aluminum device

135
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and it all being incredibly, sort of, gadget-lustish.

136
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:24,000
When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place --

137
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and I'll explain this in a second --

138
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this

139
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that they really weren't recognizing.

140
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
When you're having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine --

141
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:41,000
which was the procedure that this device's data was about;

142
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:45,000
it was for pain management -- you're shit scared; you're freaking out.

143
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did,

144
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:53,000
was hold the patient's hand to comfort them. Human gesture --

145
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:59,000
which made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible.

146
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So, the thing that we designed, much less sexy

147
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:08,000
but much more human and practical, was this.

148
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So, it's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination,

149
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:13,000
but it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand.

150
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So, again, going back to this -- the idea that a tiny human gesture

151
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:22,000
dictated the design of this product.

152
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And I think that's really, really important.

153
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So, again, this idea of workarounds.

154
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:29,000
We use this phrase "workarounds" a lot,

155
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:31,000
sort of, looking around us. I was actually looking around the TED

156
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and just watching all of these kind of things happen

157
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
while I've been here.

158
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:38,000
This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life --

159
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and the things we kind of do in our environment

160
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential --

161
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:45,000
is something that we look at a lot.

162
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:48,000
We wrote a book recently, I think you might have received it,

163
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:49,000
called "Thoughtless Acts?"

164
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do,

165
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:55,000
which have huge intention and huge opportunity.

166
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Why do we all follow the line in the street?

167
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:,000
This is a picture in a Japanese subway.

168
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:06,000
People consciously follow things even though, why, we don't know.

169
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence?

170
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to.

171
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:18,000
We don't know why, but we do.

172
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle?

173
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Again, we're sort of using the world around us

174
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:26,000
to create our own design solutions.

175
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And we're always saying to our clients: "You should look at this stuff.

176
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:31,000
This stuff is really important. This stuff is really vital."

177
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:33,000
This is people designing their own experiences.

178
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
You can draw from this.

179
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:39,000
We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street,

180
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there.

181
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:46,000
It's there for our use, on some level.

182
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So, again, we sort of co-opt our environment

183
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:51,000
to do all these different things.

184
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:52,000
We co-opt other experiences --

185
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:56,000
we take one item and transfer it to another.

186
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And this is my favorite one. My mother used to say to me,

187
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:01,000
"Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to."

188
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:03,000
But, of course, we all do. We all follow each other every day.

189
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So somebody assumes

190
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that because somebody else has done something,

191
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:09,000
that's permission for them to do the same thing.

192
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time.

193
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I mean, shopping bag equals "parking meter out of order."

194
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And we all, kind of, know how to read these signals now.

195
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:2,000
We all talk to one another in this highly visual way

196
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
without realizing what we're doing.

197
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Third section is this idea of not knowing,

198
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:29,000
of consciously putting yourself backwards.

199
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I talk about unthinking situations all the time.

200
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Sort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean

201
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and looking at things afresh.

202
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:39,000
A friend of mine was a designer at IKEA,

203
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and he was asked by his boss

204
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:44,000
to help design a storage system for children.

205
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:47,000
This is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product.

206
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Hammer it together. Hammer it together with a shoe, if you're me,

207
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:51,000
because they're impossible to assemble.

208
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:57,000
But big selling bookcase. How do we replicate this for children?

209
0:10:57,000 --> 0:11:,000
The reality is when you actually watch children,

210
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:03,000
children don't think about things like storage in linear terms.

211
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Children assume permission in a very different way.

212
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Children live on things. They live under things.

213
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:1,000
They live around things,

214
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and so their spatial awareness relationship,

215
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and their thinking around storage is totally different.

216
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:18,000
So the first thing you have to do -- this is Graham, the designer --

217
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:21,000
is, sort of, put yourself in their shoes. And so, here he is

218
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:23,000
sitting under the table.

219
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So, what came out of this?

220
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:28,000
This is the storage system that he designed.

221
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:31,000
So what is this? I hear you all ask. No, I don't.

222
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:33,000
(Laughter)

223
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
It's this, and I think this is a particularly lovely solution.

224
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:4,000
So, you know, it's a totally different way of looking at the situation.

225
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:44,000
It's a completely empathic solution --

226
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:46,000
apart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it.

227
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:5,000
(Laughter)

228
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:55,000
But a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary,

229
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and I think that's one of the things.

230
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And putting yourself in the position of the person,

231
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again

232
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:03,000
from this conference is how do we put ourselves

233
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:05,000
in other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel?

234
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And then use that information to fuel solutions?

235
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And I think that's what this is very much about.

236
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Last section: green armband. We've all got them.

237
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
It's about this really.

238
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matter

239
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:22,000
but small enough to win.

240
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Again, that's one of the themes

241
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that I think has come through loud and clear in this conference

242
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
is: Where do we start? How do we start? What do we do to start?

243
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:34,000
So, again, we were asked to design a water pump

244
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:36,000
for a company called ApproTEC, in Kenya.

245
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:39,000
They're now called KickStart.

246
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And, again, as designers,

247
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:42,000
we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful

248
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and spend a lot of time thinking of the form.

249
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And that was completely irrelevant.

250
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:51,000
When you put yourself in the position of these people,

251
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:53,000
things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up

252
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and fit on a bicycle, become much more relevant

253
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:58,000
than the form of it. The way it's produced,

254
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:01,000
it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods

255
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and indigenous materials.

256
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:07,000
So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user.

257
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:11,000
We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world.

258
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:13,000
So what seems like a very clunky product

259
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:16,000
is, in fact, incredibly useful.

260
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster -- you pump up and down on it.

261
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Children can use it. Adults can use it. Everybody uses it.

262
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:25,000
It's turning these guys -- again, one of the themes --

263
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:28,000
it's turning them into entrepreneurs.

264
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:3,000
These guys are using this very successfully.

265
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And for us, it's been great

266
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:32,000
because it's won loads of design awards.

267
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:35,000
So we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company,

268
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:37,000
the needs of the individuals in the company,

269
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:39,000
to feel good about a product we were actually designing,

270
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for.

271
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:48,000
There it is, pumping water from 30 feet.

272
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:53,000
So as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets

273
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:54,000
to all of you this morning.

274
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:57,000
We've made a donation on everybody's behalf here

275
0:13:57,000 --> 0:14:01,000
to kick start, no pun intended, their next project.

276
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Because, again, I think, sort of, putting our money where our mouth is, here.

277
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:07,000
We feel that this is an important gesture.

278
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:09,000
So we've handed out bracelets. Small is the new big.

279
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:1,000
I hope you'll all wear them.

280
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:13,000
So that's it. Thank you.

281
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:16,000
(Applause)

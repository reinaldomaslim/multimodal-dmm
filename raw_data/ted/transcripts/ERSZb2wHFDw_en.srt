1
0:00:12.857,000 --> 0:00:14,000
As an elementary school teacher,

2
0:00:14.992,000 --> 0:00:18,000
my mom did everything she could to ensure I had good reading skills.

3
0:00:20.352,000 --> 0:00:24,000
This usually consisted of weekend reading lessons at our kitchen table

4
0:00:24.842,000 --> 0:00:26,000
while my friends played outside.

5
0:00:26.95,000 --> 0:00:28,000
My reading ability improved,

6
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but these forced reading lessons didn't exactly inspire a love of reading.

7
0:00:35.945,000 --> 0:00:37,000
High school changed everything.

8
0:00:38.364,000 --> 0:00:44,000
In 10th grade, my regular English class read short stories and did spelling tests.

9
0:00:45.192,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Out of sheer boredom, I asked to be switched into another class.

10
0:00:48.632,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The next semester, I joined advanced English.

11
0:00:52.04,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:53.596,000 --> 0:00:56,000
We read two novels and wrote two book reports that semester.

13
0:00:57.975,000 --> 0:01:,000
The drastic difference and rigor between these two English classes

14
0:01:01.733,000 --> 0:01:03,000
angered me and spurred questions like,

15
0:01:05.693,000 --> 0:01:07,000
"Where did all these white people come from?"

16
0:01:07.84,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:09.102,000 --> 0:01:13,000
My high school was over 70 percent black and Latino,

18
0:01:13.129,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but this advanced English class had white students everywhere.

19
0:01:18.361,000 --> 0:01:21,000
This personal encounter with institutionalized racism

20
0:01:22.082,000 --> 0:01:24,000
altered my relationship with reading forever.

21
0:01:25.275,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I learned that I couldn't depend on a school, a teacher or curriculum

22
0:01:29.144,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to teach me what I needed to know.

23
0:01:31.495,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And more out of like, rebellion, than being intellectual,

24
0:01:35.604,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I decided I would no longer allow other people to dictate

25
0:01:39.34,000 --> 0:01:4,000
when and what I read.

26
0:01:41.65,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And without realizing it, I had stumbled upon a key

27
0:01:45.372,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to helping children read.

28
0:01:47.664,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Identity.

29
0:01:49.344,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Instead of fixating on skills

30
0:01:52.29,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and moving students from one reading level to another,

31
0:01:55.796,000 --> 0:02:,000
or forcing struggling readers to memorize lists of unfamiliar words,

32
0:02:01.334,000 --> 0:02:04,000
we should be asking ourselves this question:

33
0:02:05.055,000 --> 0:02:09,000
How can we inspire children to identify as readers?

34
0:02:10.555,000 --> 0:02:14,000
DeSean, a brilliant first-grader I taught in the Bronx,

35
0:02:15.045,000 --> 0:02:18,000
he helped me understand how identity shapes learning.

36
0:02:18.609,000 --> 0:02:21,000
One day during math, I walk up to DeSean, and I say,

37
0:02:22.372,000 --> 0:02:24,000
"DeSean, you're a great mathematician."

38
0:02:25.332,000 --> 0:02:27,000
He looks at me and responds,

39
0:02:27.433,000 --> 0:02:29,000
"I'm not a mathematician, I'm a math genius!"

40
0:02:29.994,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:31.279,000 --> 0:02:33,000
OK DeSean, right?

42
0:02:34.234,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Reading?

43
0:02:35.599,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Completely different story.

44
0:02:37.268,000 --> 0:02:38,000
"Mr. Irby, I can't read.

45
0:02:39.326,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I'm never going to learn to read," he would say.

46
0:02:42.287,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I taught DeSean to read,

47
0:02:44.99,000 --> 0:02:49,000
but there are countless black boys who remain trapped in illiteracy.

48
0:02:50.754,000 --> 0:02:52,000
According to the US Department of Education,

49
0:02:53.192,000 --> 0:02:56,000
more than 85 percent of black male fourth graders

50
0:02:57.202,000 --> 0:02:59,000
are not proficient in reading.

51
0:02:59.643,000 --> 0:03:,000
85 percent!

52
0:03:02.76,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The more challenges to reading children face,

53
0:03:07.423,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the more culturally competent educators need to be.

54
0:03:11.406,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Moonlighting as a stand-up comedian for the past eight years,

55
0:03:15.111,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I understand the importance of cultural competency,

56
0:03:18.003,000 --> 0:03:2,000
which I define as the ability to translate

57
0:03:20.974,000 --> 0:03:24,000
what you want someone else to know or be able to do

58
0:03:25.109,000 --> 0:03:3,000
into communication or experiences that they find relevant and engaging.

59
0:03:30.771,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Before going on stage, I assess an audience.

60
0:03:33.865,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Are they white, are they Latino?

61
0:03:36.342,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Are they old, young, professional, conservative?

62
0:03:40.468,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Then I curate and modify my jokes

63
0:03:43.108,000 --> 0:03:45,000
based on what I think would generate the most laughter.

64
0:03:46.34,000 --> 0:03:49,000
While performing in a church, I could tell bar jokes.

65
0:03:50.761,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But that might not result in laughter.

66
0:03:52.929,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:54.808,000 --> 0:03:59,000
As a society, we're creating reading experiences for children

68
0:03:59.973,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that are the equivalent of telling bar jokes in a church.

69
0:04:03.694,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And then we wonder why so many children don't read.

70
0:04:07.43,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Educator and philosopher Paulo Freire

71
0:04:10.309,000 --> 0:04:13,000
believed that teaching and learning should be two-way.

72
0:04:13.485,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Students shouldn't be viewed as empty buckets to be filled with facts

73
0:04:18.045,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but as cocreators of knowledge.

74
0:04:21.908,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Cookie-cutter curriculums and school policies

75
0:04:25.321,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that require students to sit statue-still

76
0:04:28.466,000 --> 0:04:3,000
or to work in complete silence --

77
0:04:30.872,000 --> 0:04:34,000
these environments often exclude the individual learning needs,

78
0:04:35.878,000 --> 0:04:37,000
the interest and expertise of children.

79
0:04:39.051,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Especially black boys.

80
0:04:41.785,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Many of the children's books promoted to black boys

81
0:04:44.806,000 --> 0:04:48,000
focus on serious topics, like slavery, civil rights and biographies.

82
0:04:50.049,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Less than two percent of teachers in the United States are black males.

83
0:04:54.078,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And a majority of black boys are raised by single mothers.

84
0:04:58.323,000 --> 0:05:02,000
There are literally young black boys who have never seen a black man reading.

85
0:05:04.458,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Or never had a black man encourage him to read.

86
0:05:09.61,000 --> 0:05:14,000
What cultural factors, what social cues are present

87
0:05:14.744,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that would lead a young black boy to conclude

88
0:05:16.904,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that reading is even something he should do?

89
0:05:19.952,000 --> 0:05:21,000
This is why I created Barbershop Books.

90
0:05:24.208,000 --> 0:05:26,000
It's a literacy nonprofit

91
0:05:26.772,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that creates child-friendly reading spaces in barber shops.

92
0:05:31.787,000 --> 0:05:32,000
The mission is simple:

93
0:05:33.431,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to help young black boys identify as readers.

94
0:05:37.562,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Lots of black boys go to the barber shop once or twice a month.

95
0:05:41.854,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Some see their barbers more than they see their fathers.

96
0:05:46.5,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Barbershop Books connects reading to a male-centered space

97
0:05:50.623,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and involves black men and boys' early reading experiences.

98
0:05:55.511,000 --> 0:05:57,000
This identity-based reading program

99
0:05:57.977,000 --> 0:06:,000
uses a curated list of children's books recommended by black boys.

100
0:06:01.737,000 --> 0:06:03,000
These are the books that they actually want to read.

101
0:06:06.543,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Scholastic's 2016 Kids and Family Report

102
0:06:10.429,000 --> 0:06:15,000
found that the number one thing children look for when choosing a book

103
0:06:16.127,000 --> 0:06:18,000
is a book that will make them laugh.

104
0:06:19.198,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So if we're serious about helping black boys and other children to read

105
0:06:24.766,000 --> 0:06:25,000
when it's not required,

106
0:06:26.711,000 --> 0:06:28,000
we need to incorporate relevant male reading models

107
0:06:29.484,000 --> 0:06:3,000
into early literacy

108
0:06:31.605,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and exchange some of the children's books that adults love so much

109
0:06:36.265,000 --> 0:06:4,000
for funny, silly or even gross books, like "Gross Greg".

110
0:06:41.114,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Laughter)

111
0:06:45.738,000 --> 0:06:5,000
"You call them boogers. Greg calls them delicious little sugars."

112
0:06:50.825,000 --> 0:06:51,000
(Laughter)

113
0:06:52.142,000 --> 0:06:55,000
That laugh, that positive reaction

114
0:06:56.11,000 --> 0:06:58,000
or gross reaction some of you just had,

115
0:06:58.565,000 --> 0:06:59,000
(Laughter)

116
0:06:59.756,000 --> 0:07:03,000
black boys deserve and desperately need more of that.

117
0:07:05.082,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Dismantling the savage inequalities that plague American education

118
0:07:09.52,000 --> 0:07:12,000
requires us to create reading experiences

119
0:07:13.174,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that inspire all children to say three words:

120
0:07:17.501,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I'm a reader.

121
0:07:19.175,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Thank you.

122
0:07:20.381,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Applause)

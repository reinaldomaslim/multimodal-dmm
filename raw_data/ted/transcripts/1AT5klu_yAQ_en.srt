1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
What I'm really here to do today is talk to you about micromanagement

2
0:00:15.52,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and what I learned about micromanagement

3
0:00:17.76,000 --> 0:00:2,000
by being a micromanager over the last few years of my life.

4
0:00:21.48,000 --> 0:00:23,000
But first off, what is micromanagement?

5
0:00:23.6,000 --> 0:00:25,000
How do we really define it?

6
0:00:25.84,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Well, I posit that it's actually taking great, wonderful, imaginative people --

7
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:31,000
like all of you --

8
0:00:31.24,000 --> 0:00:32,000
bringing them in into an organization

9
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and then crushing their souls --

10
0:00:34.76,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:37,000
by telling them what font size to use.

12
0:00:37.88,000 --> 0:00:38,000
In the history of mankind,

13
0:00:39.56,000 --> 0:00:4,000
has anyone ever said this?

14
0:00:41.4,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"John, we were never going to close that deal with Times New Roman,

15
0:00:45.88,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but because you insisted on Helvetica --

16
0:00:48.76,000 --> 0:00:49,000
bam!

17
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Dotted line --

18
0:00:51.4,000 --> 0:00:52,000
millions of dollars started to flow.

19
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
That was the missing piece!"

20
0:00:54.56,000 --> 0:00:55,000
No one's ever said that, right?

21
0:00:56.08,000 --> 0:00:59,000
There's actually physical manifestations that we probably see in ourselves

22
0:00:59.6,000 --> 0:01:,000
by being micromanaged.

23
0:01:00.88,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Think about the most tired you've ever been in your life, right?

24
0:01:03.96,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It probably wasn't when you stayed the latest at work,

25
0:01:06.56,000 --> 0:01:08,000
or it wasn't when you came home from a road trip,

26
0:01:09.12,000 --> 0:01:12,000
it was probably when you had someone looking over your shoulder,

27
0:01:12.64,000 --> 0:01:14,000
watching your each and every move.

28
0:01:16.4,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Kind of like my mother-in-law when she's over right?

29
0:01:18.88,000 --> 0:01:19,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:19.92,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I'm like, "I got this," you know?

31
0:01:21.64,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And so there's actually data to support this.

32
0:01:23.8,000 --> 0:01:24,000
There was a recent study in the UK.

33
0:01:25.8,000 --> 0:01:27,000
They took 100 hospital employees,

34
0:01:27.96,000 --> 0:01:28,000
put an activity tracker on them

35
0:01:29.64,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and then let them go about their next 12-hour shift all alone,

36
0:01:33.08,000 --> 0:01:34,000
just a regular 12-hour shift.

37
0:01:35.08,000 --> 0:01:38,000
At the end of the shift, they asked them, "Do you feel fatigued?"

38
0:01:38.64,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And what they found was actually really interesting.

39
0:01:41.12,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It wasn't necessarily the people who moved the most

40
0:01:43.56,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that felt the most fatigued,

41
0:01:44.96,000 --> 0:01:47,000
but it was the folks that didn't have control over their jobs.

42
0:01:49.12,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So if we know that micromanagement isn't really effective,

43
0:01:52.48,000 --> 0:01:53,000
why do we do it?

44
0:01:54.28,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Is it that the definition is wrong?

45
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I posited that micromanagement

46
0:01:58.44,000 --> 0:02:01,000
is just bringing in great, wonderful, imaginative people

47
0:02:01.48,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and then crushing their souls,

48
0:02:02.96,000 --> 0:02:03,000
so is it that we actually want to hire --

49
0:02:04.96,000 --> 0:02:05,000
deep down inside of us --

50
0:02:06.36,000 --> 0:02:07,000
dull and unimaginative people?

51
0:02:09.08,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It's one of those questions you probably don't even need to ask.

52
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It's like, "Do you want to get your luggage stolen at the airport?"

53
0:02:15.36,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Probably not, but I've never been asked, right?

54
0:02:17.6,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So has anyone asked you, as a manager,

55
0:02:20.039,000 --> 0:02:22,000
"Do you want to hire dull and unimaginative people?"

56
0:02:22.88,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So, I don't know, this is TED, we better back it up with data.

57
0:02:25.84,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We actually asked hundreds of people around the country --

58
0:02:28.6,000 --> 0:02:3,000
hundreds of managers across the country --

59
0:02:30.624,000 --> 0:02:32,000
do you want to hire dull and unimaginative people?

60
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Alright, it's an interesting question.

61
0:02:35.88,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Well, interesting results as well.

62
0:02:37.56,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So, 94% said no --

63
0:02:38.84,000 --> 0:02:39,000
(Laughter)

64
0:02:40.08,000 --> 0:02:42,000
we don't want to hire dull and unimaginative people.

65
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Six percent probably didn't understand the question --

66
0:02:45.6,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

67
0:02:47.32,000 --> 0:02:48,000
but, bless their hearts,

68
0:02:48.6,000 --> 0:02:5,000
maybe they do just want to hire dull and unimaginative people.

69
0:02:51.56,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But 94 percent said they did not, and so why do we do this still then?

70
0:02:55.28,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Well, I posit that it's something really, really simple

71
0:02:57.92,000 --> 0:03:,000
that all of us deep down inside know and have actually felt.

72
0:03:01.68,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So when we get hired into an organization --

73
0:03:03.8,000 --> 0:03:05,000
it could be a club, it could be a law firm,

74
0:03:05.88,000 --> 0:03:08,000
it could be a school organization, it could be anything --

75
0:03:09.28,000 --> 0:03:11,000
no one ever jumps to the top of the totem pole, right?

76
0:03:12.12,000 --> 0:03:13,000
You start at the very bottom.

77
0:03:13.96,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Doing what?

78
0:03:15.2,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Doing work.

79
0:03:16.44,000 --> 0:03:18,000
You actually do the work, right?

80
0:03:18.8,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And if you're really good at doing the work,

81
0:03:20.92,000 --> 0:03:21,000
what do you get rewarded with?

82
0:03:22.4,000 --> 0:03:23,000
More work, right?

83
0:03:23.64,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Yeah, that's right, you guys are all great micromanagers.

84
0:03:26.36,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Laughter)

85
0:03:27.64,000 --> 0:03:28,000
You do more work,

86
0:03:28.92,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and then pretty soon, if you're really good at it,

87
0:03:31.32,000 --> 0:03:32,000
you do a little bit of work still,

88
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but actually, you start to manage people doing the work.

89
0:03:35.68,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And if you're really good at that, what happens after that?

90
0:03:38.8,000 --> 0:03:42,000
You start managing the people who manage the people doing the work,

91
0:03:43.32,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and it's at that point in time,

92
0:03:45.28,000 --> 0:03:49,000
you start to lose control over the output of your job.

93
0:03:49.44,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I've actually witnessed this firsthand.

94
0:03:51.52,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So, I started a company called Boxed in our garage,

95
0:03:53.96,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and this was it -- I know it doesn't seem like much --

96
0:03:56.68,000 --> 0:03:59,000
you know, there's a pressure washer in the back --

97
0:03:59.84,000 --> 0:04:,000
this is "living the dream."

98
0:04:01.64,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And my wife was really proud of me when we started this,

99
0:04:04.32,000 --> 0:04:06,000
or that's what she said, she was really proud of me --

100
0:04:06.92,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and so she would give me a hug, and I'm pretty sure she had her phone up

101
0:04:10.36,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and she was thinking, "Oh, is John from Harvard still single?"

102
0:04:13.32,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It was kind of like a lemonade stand gone wrong in the beginning,

103
0:04:16.4,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but we actually went up and said mobile commerce is going to be big,

104
0:04:19.64,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and actually consumer packaged goods were going to change over time,

105
0:04:22.88,000 --> 0:04:25,000
so let's take these big, bulky packs that you don't want to lug home --

106
0:04:26.28,000 --> 0:04:28,000
so not the two-pack of Oreo cookies but the 24-pack

107
0:04:28.72,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and not the 24-pack of toilet paper but the 48-pack --

108
0:04:31.72,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and let's ship it to you much like a warehouse club would do

109
0:04:34.6,000 --> 0:04:35,000
except they wouldn't ship it to you.

110
0:04:36.36,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So that's what we basically did.

111
0:04:37.96,000 --> 0:04:38,000
We had a really slow printer

112
0:04:39.4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and what we did was actually say, "OK, this printer is taking forever, man.

113
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Let's scribble something that would delight the customer

114
0:04:45.68,000 --> 0:04:46,000
on the back of these invoices."

115
0:04:47.2,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So we'd say, "Hey, keep smiling," you know?

116
0:04:49.36,000 --> 0:04:5,000
"Hey, you're awesome,"

117
0:04:50.96,000 --> 0:04:51,000
or, "Hey, enjoy the Doritos,"

118
0:04:52.44,000 --> 0:04:53,000
or, "We love Gatorade, too."

119
0:04:54.44,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Stuff like that.

120
0:04:55.8,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And so it started breaking up the monotony of the job as well

121
0:05:00.28,000 --> 0:05:02,000
because I was picking and packing all of the boxes,

122
0:05:02.68,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and that's all you basically do for eight, nine, 10, 12 hours a day

123
0:05:05.88,000 --> 0:05:06,000
when you're sitting in the garage.

124
0:05:07.56,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And so an interesting thing happened.

125
0:05:09.4,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So we actually started to grow.

126
0:05:12.08,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And so, you know, over the last --

127
0:05:14.4,000 --> 0:05:16,000
actually just even 36 months after that,

128
0:05:16.76,000 --> 0:05:19,000
we ended up selling hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stuff,

129
0:05:20.04,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and we actually grew really, really quickly.

130
0:05:22.6,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But during that time, my role started to change, too.

131
0:05:25.28,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So, yes, I was the CEO in the garage;

132
0:05:27.8,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I was picking and packing, doing all the work,

133
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but then I graduated

134
0:05:31.24,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to actually managing the people who picked and packed,

135
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and then pretty soon I managed the people

136
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:38,000
who managed the people picking and packing.

137
0:05:38.08,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And even now, I manage the C-staff who manage the departments

138
0:05:41.48,000 --> 0:05:44,000
who manage the people who manage the people picking and packing.

139
0:05:44.88,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And it is at that point in time, I lost control.

140
0:05:47.88,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So I thought, OK, we were delighting all of these customers with these notes.

141
0:05:51.56,000 --> 0:05:53,000
They loved them, but I can't write these notes anymore,

142
0:05:54.2,000 --> 0:05:55,000
so you know what I'm going to do?

143
0:05:55.84,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I'm going to tell these folks how to write these notes.

144
0:05:58.84,000 --> 0:06:01,000
What pen to use, what color to use, what you should write,

145
0:06:02.8,000 --> 0:06:03,000
what font you should use,

146
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
don't mess up the margins,

147
0:06:05.68,000 --> 0:06:07,000
this has to be this big, this has to be that big.

148
0:06:08.08,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And pretty soon this goal of raising morale

149
0:06:10.6,000 --> 0:06:12,000
by breaking up the monotony in the fulfillment center

150
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
actually became micromanagement, and people started complaining to HR.

151
0:06:16.48,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It's like, "Dude, this CEO guy has got to get out of my hair, OK?

152
0:06:19.56,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I know how to write a damn note."

153
0:06:21.2,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Laughter)

154
0:06:22.24,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So it was at that point in time, we said, "OK, you know?

155
0:06:25.52,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We hired these great, wonderful people,

156
0:06:28.72,000 --> 0:06:3,000
let's give them the mission that's 'delight the customer,'

157
0:06:31.48,000 --> 0:06:34,000
let's give them the tool to do so, and that's these notes -- have at it."

158
0:06:35.2,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And so what we found was actually pretty startling.

159
0:06:37.64,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Some folks actually took the notes

160
0:06:39.32,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and actually started drawing these really ornate minimurals on them.

161
0:06:43.32,000 --> 0:06:46,000
When folks ordered diapers, you'd get really fun notes like this:

162
0:06:46.96,000 --> 0:06:47,000
"Say 'hi' to the baby for us!"

163
0:06:48.56,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And you know, the next size up, if they bought a bigger size,

164
0:06:51.48,000 --> 0:06:53,000
they'd write, "Growing up so fast."

165
0:06:53.84,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And so people really, really took to it.

166
0:06:57.4,000 --> 0:07:,000
But it was at that time that it also went off the rails a few times.

167
0:07:00.64,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And so we had someone just writing, "Thx, thx," all the time,

168
0:07:03.64,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and it's like, "Alright, dude, my boss used to write that to me,"

169
0:07:06.76,000 --> 0:07:08,000
so, let's not write "Thx" anymore.

170
0:07:09.04,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But you also had interesting things on the other side.

171
0:07:11.68,000 --> 0:07:12,000
People got a little too creative.

172
0:07:13.6,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And so, like I said before, we sell everything in bulk:

173
0:07:17.24,000 --> 0:07:19,000
the big packs of diapers, big packs of toilet paper,

174
0:07:19.72,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the big packs of Doritos and Oreo cookies.

175
0:07:23.04,000 --> 0:07:26,000
We also sell the big packs of contraception,

176
0:07:26.36,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and so --

177
0:07:27.72,000 --> 0:07:28,000
this is getting a little hairy.

178
0:07:29.44,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Laughter)

179
0:07:30.68,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So we sell the 40-pack of condoms, right?

180
0:07:34.68,000 --> 0:07:36,000
We're all adults in this room -- 40-pack of condoms.

181
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So, someone ordered four 40-packs of condoms --

182
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Laughter)

183
0:07:42.4,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And that's all they ordered,

184
0:07:44.48,000 --> 0:07:46,000
so, 160 condoms,

185
0:07:46.6,000 --> 0:07:48,000
the packer was like, "I know how to delight the customer."

186
0:07:49.36,000 --> 0:07:5,000
(Laughter)

187
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:52,000
"This guy ..."

188
0:07:52.64,000 --> 0:07:53,000
This is what they wrote:

189
0:07:54.6,000 --> 0:07:55,000
[Everyone loves an optimist]

190
0:07:56.24,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Laughter)

191
0:07:57.48,000 --> 0:08:,000
(Applause)

192
0:08:01.12,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We didn't know whether to fire him or to promote him, but he's still there.

193
0:08:04.72,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So, "Everyone loves an optimist."

194
0:08:06.52,000 --> 0:08:11,000
But here is where it went a little bit off the rails

195
0:08:11.68,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and I felt a little bit conflicted in all of this.

196
0:08:14.68,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And --

197
0:08:16.36,000 --> 0:08:17,000
oh, there's a really bad typo --

198
0:08:17.96,000 --> 0:08:21,000
so if there was only a red T-E-D on stage that I counted on being here,

199
0:08:22.68,000 --> 0:08:23,000
it wouldn't be a typo, right?

200
0:08:24.24,000 --> 0:08:25,000
(Laughter)

201
0:08:25.28,000 --> 0:08:26,000
(Applause)

202
0:08:26.84,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I promised you I had a really bad sense of humor,

203
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and now I'm gratifying that.

204
0:08:30.56,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So I told you. But I really was conflicted, right?

205
0:08:33.12,000 --> 0:08:35,000
At this point in time, we started doing things

206
0:08:35.32,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that actually weren't part of our core mission

207
0:08:37.52,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and people started failing at it.

208
0:08:39.64,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And so, I thought, should we let them fail?

209
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Should we continue to let them do this?

210
0:08:45.64,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I don't know --

211
0:08:46.919,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I didn't know at that moment,

212
0:08:48.679,000 --> 0:08:49,000
but I thought this:

213
0:08:50.48,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Is failure really that bad?

214
0:08:53.32,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I'm not saying we should celebrate failure.

215
0:08:55.44,000 --> 0:08:58,000
There's a lot of talk in Silicon Valley that says, "Let's celebrate failure."

216
0:08:59.12,000 --> 0:09:01,000
No, I don't know if we would go all the way there,

217
0:09:01.52,000 --> 0:09:02,000
because like, in our board meetings,

218
0:09:03.4,000 --> 0:09:06,000
our board members are never like, "Hey, Chieh, you failed last quarter,

219
0:09:06.8,000 --> 0:09:07,000
keep doing that, buddy, OK?"

220
0:09:08.2,000 --> 0:09:09,000
No one's ever said that.

221
0:09:09.48,000 --> 0:09:11,000
If you're part of an organization like that,

222
0:09:11.6,000 --> 0:09:13,000
give me a call, I want to sit in on that meeting.

223
0:09:13.96,000 --> 0:09:15,000
In private, I don't think many people celebrate failure,

224
0:09:16.64,000 --> 0:09:18,000
but failure, I posit, is actually pretty necessary

225
0:09:19.24,000 --> 0:09:21,000
for the folks truly in the long-term,

226
0:09:21.44,000 --> 0:09:22,000
for the smart and imaginative people

227
0:09:23.24,000 --> 0:09:26,000
truly trying to fulfill the mission that you give them at hand.

228
0:09:27.12,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And so failure can actually be seen as a milestone

229
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
along that mission towards success.

230
0:09:33.4,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And if the downside of not micromanaging

231
0:09:35.52,000 --> 0:09:38,000
is potentially this perceived notion that you might fail more often,

232
0:09:38.88,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and if it's really not that bad,

233
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
what is the upside?

234
0:09:42.4,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Well, we saw the upside and it's pretty great.

235
0:09:44.68,000 --> 0:09:45,000
We tasked our engineers and said,

236
0:09:46.32,000 --> 0:09:49,000
"Hey, some of our fulfillment centers cost millions of dollars to build,

237
0:09:49.96,000 --> 0:09:5,000
there's miles and miles of conveyor,

238
0:09:51.92,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and so, can you do the same thing,

239
0:09:53.6,000 --> 0:09:56,000
can you make them efficient without spending millions of dollars?"

240
0:09:56.76,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So, they got to work:

241
0:09:58.04,000 --> 0:10:,000
they actually did this -- this is not photoshopped,

242
0:10:00.48,000 --> 0:10:01,000
the guy is really grinding.

243
0:10:02.04,000 --> 0:10:03,000
They built an autonomous guided vehicle.

244
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:06,000
We didn't tell them what to build, what format it needed to be.

245
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:09,000
In 90 days they produced the first prototype:

246
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
powered off Tesla batteries, stereoscopic cameras, lidar systems.

247
0:10:12.28,000 --> 0:10:14,000
It basically replicates the efficiency of a conveyor belt

248
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:18,000
without the actual capex of a conveyor belt.

249
0:10:18.28,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So it doesn't actually just stop with engineers.

250
0:10:20.64,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Our marketing department --

251
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:25,000
we told them, "Hey, get the word out; do the right thing."

252
0:10:25.28,000 --> 0:10:27,000
We have this wonderful lady, Nitasha, on the marketing team.

253
0:10:28.28,000 --> 0:10:29,000
She stopped me in the morning,

254
0:10:29.76,000 --> 0:10:31,000
she's like, "Chieh, what are we doing about the pink tax?"

255
0:10:32.52,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I went and got my coffee, I sat down,

256
0:10:34.36,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I said, "OK, Nitasha, what is this pink tax?"

257
0:10:36.52,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And so she told me, it's really interesting.

258
0:10:38.6,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So, some of you might know that in 32 states across America,

259
0:10:41.48,000 --> 0:10:44,000
we actually charge a luxury goods tax on women's products

260
0:10:44.68,000 --> 0:10:45,000
like feminine care products,

261
0:10:46.08,000 --> 0:10:48,000
so tampons and pads are taxed like luxury goods items.

262
0:10:48.64,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So I would never dare call my wife --

263
0:10:50.48,000 --> 0:10:53,000
or if she called me and said, "Hey, hon, bring some pads on the way home,"

264
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and I said, "Babe, you know, there's a trade war going on,

265
0:10:56.76,000 --> 0:10:57,000
the economy's not that good,

266
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
so no luxury goods this month but next month I promise --

267
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Laughter)

268
0:11:02.04,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I'll take a look at it."

269
0:11:03.32,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I'd be single pretty quickly, right?

270
0:11:05.08,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But what's super interesting is now --

271
0:11:07.8,000 --> 0:11:08,000
we didn't tell them what to do --

272
0:11:09.44,000 --> 0:11:11,000
but now, working with finance, they rebate the tax

273
0:11:11.84,000 --> 0:11:14,000
back to customers all around the country that we unfairly have to collect.

274
0:11:15.36,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And so at this point in time, you might be thinking,

275
0:11:17.84,000 --> 0:11:2,000
"OK, what is the real, real upside of not micromanaging?"

276
0:11:21.8,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and it's this:

277
0:11:23.48,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I didn't do any of these projects.

278
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
I didn't make the AGV.

279
0:11:26.44,000 --> 0:11:28,000
I didn't do the "Rethink the Pink Tax" campaign.

280
0:11:28.88,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I didn't do any of this,

281
0:11:30.12,000 --> 0:11:33,000
but I'm standing here on a TED stage taking all the credit for it.

282
0:11:33.6,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Laughter)

283
0:11:36.96,000 --> 0:11:38,000
"This guy does nothing and takes all the credit for it.

284
0:11:39.6,000 --> 0:11:41,000
He's a real CEO, this guy. He's really got it down."

285
0:11:42.08,000 --> 0:11:43,000
(Laughter)

286
0:11:43.32,000 --> 0:11:44,000
But the reality is this.

287
0:11:45.08,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I don't have the CEO thing down 100 percent pat,

288
0:11:47.52,000 --> 0:11:51,000
but I've actually learned the most fundamentally challenging lesson

289
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
I've ever had to learn,

290
0:11:54.64,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and that's this.

291
0:11:56.2,000 --> 0:11:59,000
There is only one solution to micromanagement ...

292
0:11:59.84,000 --> 0:12:,000
and that's to trust.

293
0:12:01.32,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Thank you.

294
0:12:02.56,000 --> 0:12:06,000
(Applause)

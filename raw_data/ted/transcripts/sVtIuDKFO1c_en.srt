0:00:13.1,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Getting a college education

2
0:00:15.145,000 --> 0:00:17,000
is a 20-year investment.

3
0:00:18.22,000 --> 0:00:19,000
When you're growing up poor,

4
0:00:19.9,000 --> 0:00:21,000
you're not accustomed to thinking that far ahead.

5
0:00:22.86,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Instead, you're thinking about where you're going to get your next meal

6
0:00:26.22,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and how your family is going to pay rent that month.

7
0:00:29.1,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Besides, my parents and my friends' parents

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
seemed to be doing just fine driving taxis and working as janitors.

9
0:00:36.74,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It wasn't until I was a teenager

10
0:00:38.66,000 --> 0:00:4,000
when I realized I didn't want to do those things.

11
0:00:41.94,000 --> 0:00:44,000
By then, I was two-thirds of the way through my education,

12
0:00:45.58,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and it was almost too late to turn things around.

13
0:00:49.5,000 --> 0:00:51,000
When you grow up poor, you want to be rich.

14
0:00:52.62,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I was no different.

15
0:00:54.42,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I'm the second-oldest of seven,

16
0:00:56.18,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and was raised by a single mother on government aid

17
0:00:58.62,000 --> 0:00:59,000
in Queens, New York.

18
0:01:00.54,000 --> 0:01:01,000
By virtue of growing up low-income,

19
0:01:02.5,000 --> 0:01:04,000
my siblings and I went to some of New York City's

20
0:01:04.86,000 --> 0:01:05,000
most struggling public schools.

21
0:01:07.02,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I had over 60 absences when I was in seventh grade,

22
0:01:11.1,000 --> 0:01:13,000
because I didn't feel like going to class.

23
0:01:13.7,000 --> 0:01:16,000
My high school had a 55 percent graduation rate,

24
0:01:16.779,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and even worse,

25
0:01:18.1,000 --> 0:01:2,000
only 20 percent of the kids graduating

26
0:01:20.42,000 --> 0:01:21,000
were college-ready.

27
0:01:22.78,000 --> 0:01:24,000
When I actually did make it to college,

28
0:01:24.94,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I told my friend Brennan

29
0:01:26.38,000 --> 0:01:29,000
how our teachers would always ask us to raise our hands

30
0:01:30.1,000 --> 0:01:32,000
if we were going to college.

31
0:01:33.22,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I was taken aback when Brennan said,

32
0:01:34.98,000 --> 0:01:36,000
"Karim, I've never been asked that question before."

33
0:01:38.54,000 --> 0:01:4,000
It was always, "What college are you going to?"

34
0:01:41.54,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Just the way that question is phrased

35
0:01:43.5,000 --> 0:01:45,000
made it unacceptable for him not to have gone to college.

36
0:01:47.78,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Nowadays I get asked a different question.

37
0:01:50.5,000 --> 0:01:52,000
"How were you able to make it out?"

38
0:01:53.58,000 --> 0:01:55,000
For years I said I was lucky,

39
0:01:57.14,000 --> 0:01:58,000
but it's not just luck.

40
0:01:59.1,000 --> 0:02:01,000
When my older brother and I graduated from high school

41
0:02:01.7,000 --> 0:02:02,000
at the very same time

42
0:02:02.98,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and he later dropped out of a two-year college,

43
0:02:05.22,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I wanted to understand why he dropped out

44
0:02:07.7,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and I kept studying.

45
0:02:10.06,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It wasn't until I got to Cornell as a Presidential Research Scholar

46
0:02:13.46,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that I started to learn about the very real educational consequences

47
0:02:17.22,000 --> 0:02:19,000
of being raised by a single mother on government aid

48
0:02:20.019,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and attending the schools that I did.

49
0:02:22.739,000 --> 0:02:25,000
That's when my older brother's trajectory began to make complete sense to me.

50
0:02:28.1,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I also learned that our most admirable education reformers,

51
0:02:31.5,000 --> 0:02:34,000
people like Arne Duncan, the former US Secretary of Education,

52
0:02:35.18,000 --> 0:02:37,000
or Wendy Kopp, the founder of Teach For America,

53
0:02:37.9,000 --> 0:02:39,000
had never attended an inner city public school like I had.

54
0:02:41.34,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So much of our education reform is driven by a sympathetic approach,

55
0:02:45.18,000 --> 0:02:46,000
where people are saying,

56
0:02:46.46,000 --> 0:02:49,000
"Let's go and help these poor inner city kids,

57
0:02:49.5,000 --> 0:02:51,000
or these poor black and Latino kids,"

58
0:02:52.14,000 --> 0:02:54,000
instead of an empathetic approach,

59
0:02:54.54,000 --> 0:02:57,000
where someone like me, who had grown up in this environment, could say,

60
0:02:57.98,000 --> 0:02:59,000
"I know the adversities that you're facing

61
0:03:00.22,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and I want to help you overcome them."

62
0:03:03.38,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Today when I get questions about how I made it out,

63
0:03:06.1,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I share that one of the biggest reasons

64
0:03:08.62,000 --> 0:03:1,000
is that I wasn't ashamed to ask for help.

65
0:03:11.66,000 --> 0:03:13,000
In a typical middle class or affluent household,

66
0:03:14.3,000 --> 0:03:15,000
if a kid is struggling,

67
0:03:16.1,000 --> 0:03:19,000
there's a good chance that a parent or a teacher will come to their rescue

68
0:03:20.06,000 --> 0:03:21,000
even if they don't ask for help.

69
0:03:22.02,000 --> 0:03:24,000
However, if that same kid is growing up poor

70
0:03:24.18,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and doesn't ask for help,

71
0:03:26.06,000 --> 0:03:28,000
there's a good chance that no one will help them.

72
0:03:28.7,000 --> 0:03:31,000
There are virtually no social safety nets available.

73
0:03:32.98,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So seven years ago,

74
0:03:34.38,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I started to reform our public education system

75
0:03:37.22,000 --> 0:03:39,000
shaped by my firsthand perspective.

76
0:03:40.78,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And I started with summer school.

77
0:03:43.78,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Research tells us that two-thirds of the achievement gap,

78
0:03:47.14,000 --> 0:03:49,000
which is the disparity in educational attainment

79
0:03:49.5,000 --> 0:03:51,000
between rich kids and poor kids

80
0:03:51.7,000 --> 0:03:53,000
or black kids and white kids,

81
0:03:53.86,000 --> 0:03:55,000
could be directly attributed to the summer learning loss.

82
0:03:57.46,000 --> 0:03:59,000
In low-income neighborhoods, kids forget almost three months

83
0:04:00.3,000 --> 0:04:02,000
of what they learned during the school year

84
0:04:02.38,000 --> 0:04:03,000
over the summer.

85
0:04:03.74,000 --> 0:04:04,000
They return to school in the fall,

86
0:04:05.38,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and their teachers spend another two months

87
0:04:07.46,000 --> 0:04:08,000
reteaching them old material.

88
0:04:08.9,000 --> 0:04:09,000
That's five months.

89
0:04:10.42,000 --> 0:04:12,000
The school year in the United States is only 10 months.

90
0:04:13.06,000 --> 0:04:15,000
If kids lose five months of learning every single year,

91
0:04:15.7,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that's half of their education.

92
0:04:17.94,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Half.

93
0:04:19.9,000 --> 0:04:22,000
If kids were in school over the summer, then they couldn't regress,

94
0:04:23.82,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but traditional summer school is poorly designed.

95
0:04:26.74,000 --> 0:04:28,000
For kids it feels like punishment,

96
0:04:28.82,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and for teachers it feels like babysitting.

97
0:04:32.14,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But how can we expect principals to execute an effective summer program

98
0:04:36.18,000 --> 0:04:38,000
when the school year ends the last week of June

99
0:04:38.66,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and then summer school starts just one week later?

100
0:04:41.78,000 --> 0:04:43,000
There just isn't enough time to find the right people,

101
0:04:44.38,000 --> 0:04:45,000
sort out the logistics,

102
0:04:45.66,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and design an engaging curriculum that excites kids and teachers.

103
0:04:51.58,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But what if we created a program over the summer

104
0:04:55.58,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that empowered teachers as teaching coaches

105
0:04:59.3,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to develop aspiring educators?

106
0:05:02.54,000 --> 0:05:04,000
What if we empowered college-educated role models

107
0:05:05.3,000 --> 0:05:06,000
as teaching fellows

108
0:05:07.38,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to help kids realize their college ambitions?

109
0:05:09.94,000 --> 0:05:11,000
What if empowered high-achieving kids

110
0:05:12.22,000 --> 0:05:15,000
as mentors to tutor their younger peers

111
0:05:15.66,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and inspire them to invest in their education?

112
0:05:19.46,000 --> 0:05:22,000
What if we empowered all kids as scholars,

113
0:05:23.22,000 --> 0:05:26,000
asked them what colleges they were going to,

114
0:05:26.46,000 --> 0:05:28,000
designed a summer school they want to attend

115
0:05:30.22,000 --> 0:05:32,000
to completely eliminate the summer learning loss

116
0:05:32.78,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and close two-thirds of the achievement gap?

117
0:05:37.1,000 --> 0:05:41,000
By this summer, my team will have served over 4,000 low-income children,

118
0:05:41.74,000 --> 0:05:43,000
trained over 300 aspiring teachers

119
0:05:44.7,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and created more than 1,000 seasonal jobs

120
0:05:47.02,000 --> 0:05:5,000
across some of New York City's most disadvantaged neighborhoods.

121
0:05:50.82,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Applause)

122
0:05:56.66,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And our kids are succeeding.

123
0:05:59.02,000 --> 0:06:,000
Two years of independent evaluations

124
0:06:01.02,000 --> 0:06:03,000
tell us that our kids eliminate the summer learning loss

125
0:06:03.98,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and make growth of one month in math

126
0:06:06.18,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and two months in reading.

127
0:06:08.02,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So instead of returning to school in the fall three months behind,

128
0:06:11.54,000 --> 0:06:13,000
they now go back four months ahead in math

129
0:06:15.38,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and five months ahead in reading.

130
0:06:17.46,000 --> 0:06:2,000
(Applause)

131
0:06:24.58,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Ten years ago, if you would have told me

132
0:06:26.54,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that I'd graduate in the top 10 percent of my class from an Ivy League institution

133
0:06:30.74,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and have an opportunity to make a dent on our public education system

134
0:06:34.74,000 --> 0:06:37,000
just by tackling two months of the calendar year,

135
0:06:38.5,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I would have said,

136
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
"Nah. No way."

137
0:06:43.54,000 --> 0:06:44,000
What's even more exciting

138
0:06:45.06,000 --> 0:06:48,000
is that if we can prevent five months of lost time

139
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
just by redesigning two months,

140
0:06:51.3,000 --> 0:06:53,000
imagine the possibilities that we can unlock

141
0:06:53.98,000 --> 0:06:55,000
by tackling the rest of the calendar year.

142
0:06:57.98,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Thank you.

143
0:06:59.22,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Applause)

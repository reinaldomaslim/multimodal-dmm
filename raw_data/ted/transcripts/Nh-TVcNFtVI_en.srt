1
0:00:13.436,000 --> 0:00:16,000
One hot October morning,

2
0:00:16.667,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I got off the all-night train

3
0:00:19.401,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in Mandalay,

4
0:00:20.583,000 --> 0:00:23,000
the old royal capital of Burma,

5
0:00:23.725,000 --> 0:00:24,000
now Myanmar.

6
0:00:25.66,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And out on the street, I ran into a group of rough men

7
0:00:29.882,000 --> 0:00:32,000
standing beside their bicycle rickshaws.

8
0:00:33.799,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And one of them came up

9
0:00:35.193,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and offered to show me around.

10
0:00:38.615,000 --> 0:00:4,000
The price he quoted was outrageous.

11
0:00:41.832,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It was less than I would pay for a bar of chocolate at home.

12
0:00:45.844,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So I clambered into his trishaw,

13
0:00:49.009,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and he began pedaling us slowly between palaces and pagodas.

14
0:00:55.972,000 --> 0:01:,000
And as he did, he told me how he had come to the city from his village.

15
0:01:01.295,000 --> 0:01:03,000
He'd earned a degree in mathematics.

16
0:01:03.698,000 --> 0:01:05,000
His dream was to be a teacher.

17
0:01:06.445,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But of course, life is hard under a military dictatorship,

18
0:01:11.281,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and so for now, this was the only way he could make a living.

19
0:01:16.796,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Many nights, he told me, he actually slept in his trishaw

20
0:01:20.761,000 --> 0:01:24,000
so he could catch the first visitors off the all-night train.

21
0:01:27.543,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And very soon, we found that in certain ways,

22
0:01:31.416,000 --> 0:01:32,000
we had so much in common --

23
0:01:33.106,000 --> 0:01:34,000
we were both in our 20s,

24
0:01:34.991,000 --> 0:01:37,000
we were both fascinated by foreign cultures --

25
0:01:38.734,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that he invited me home.

26
0:01:42.056,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So we turned off the wide, crowded streets,

27
0:01:45.887,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and we began bumping down rough, wild alleyways.

28
0:01:50.121,000 --> 0:01:52,000
There were broken shacks all around.

29
0:01:52.493,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I really lost the sense of where I was,

30
0:01:56.136,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and I realized that anything could happen to me now.

31
0:01:59.842,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I could get mugged or drugged

32
0:02:02.308,000 --> 0:02:03,000
or something worse.

33
0:02:03.648,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Nobody would know.

34
0:02:06.309,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Finally, he stopped and led me into a hut,

35
0:02:10.03,000 --> 0:02:13,000
which consisted of just one tiny room.

36
0:02:14.228,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And then he leaned down,

37
0:02:16.429,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and reached under his bed.

38
0:02:19.608,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And something in me froze.

39
0:02:24.046,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I waited to see what he would pull out.

40
0:02:27.361,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And finally he extracted a box.

41
0:02:31.295,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Inside it was every single letter he had ever received

42
0:02:36.25,000 --> 0:02:38,000
from visitors from abroad,

43
0:02:39.001,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and on some of them he had pasted

44
0:02:41.127,000 --> 0:02:44,000
little black-and-white worn snapshots

45
0:02:44.542,000 --> 0:02:46,000
of his new foreign friends.

46
0:02:48.387,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So when we said goodbye that night,

47
0:02:52.038,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I realized he had also shown me

48
0:02:54.649,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the secret point of travel,

49
0:02:56.983,000 --> 0:02:58,000
which is to take a plunge,

50
0:02:59.063,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to go inwardly as well as outwardly

51
0:03:01.779,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to places you would never go otherwise,

52
0:03:04.99,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to venture into uncertainty,

53
0:03:07.928,000 --> 0:03:08,000
ambiguity,

54
0:03:09.498,000 --> 0:03:1,000
even fear.

55
0:03:12.298,000 --> 0:03:14,000
At home, it's dangerously easy

56
0:03:14.761,000 --> 0:03:16,000
to assume we're on top of things.

57
0:03:17.81,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Out in the world, you are reminded every moment that you're not,

58
0:03:22.309,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and you can't get to the bottom of things, either.

59
0:03:26.235,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Everywhere, "People wish to be settled,"

60
0:03:29.161,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Ralph Waldo Emerson reminded us,

61
0:03:31.464,000 --> 0:03:33,000
"but only insofar as we are unsettled

62
0:03:34.164,000 --> 0:03:35,000
is there any hope for us."

63
0:03:36.891,000 --> 0:03:38,000
At this conference, we've been lucky enough

64
0:03:39.342,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to hear some exhilarating new ideas and discoveries

65
0:03:42.819,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and, really, about all the ways

66
0:03:44.599,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in which knowledge is being pushed excitingly forwards.

67
0:03:48.797,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But at some point, knowledge gives out.

68
0:03:52.802,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And that is the moment

69
0:03:54.05,000 --> 0:03:56,000
when your life is truly decided:

70
0:03:57.825,000 --> 0:03:58,000
you fall in love;

71
0:04:00.093,000 --> 0:04:01,000
you lose a friend;

72
0:04:02.893,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the lights go out.

73
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And it's then, when you're lost or uneasy or carried out of yourself,

74
0:04:10.038,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that you find out who you are.

75
0:04:14.224,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I don't believe that ignorance is bliss.

76
0:04:18.193,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Science has unquestionably made our lives

77
0:04:21.348,000 --> 0:04:23,000
brighter and longer and healthier.

78
0:04:24.825,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And I am forever grateful to the teachers who showed me the laws of physics

79
0:04:29.676,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and pointed out that three times three makes nine.

80
0:04:33.678,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I can count that out on my fingers

81
0:04:36.527,000 --> 0:04:38,000
any time of night or day.

82
0:04:40.802,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But when a mathematician tells me

83
0:04:42.438,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that minus three times minus three makes nine,

84
0:04:45.985,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that's a kind of logic that almost feels like trust.

85
0:04:52.674,000 --> 0:04:55,000
The opposite of knowledge, in other words, isn't always ignorance.

86
0:04:56.948,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It can be wonder.

87
0:04:58.482,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Or mystery.

88
0:04:59.964,000 --> 0:05:,000
Possibility.

89
0:05:01.894,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And in my life, I've found it's the things I don't know

90
0:05:05.755,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that have lifted me up and pushed me forwards

91
0:05:08.458,000 --> 0:05:1,000
much more than the things I do know.

92
0:05:12.222,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It's also the things I don't know

93
0:05:14.045,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that have often brought me closer to everybody around me.

94
0:05:18.549,000 --> 0:05:2,000
For eight straight Novembers, recently,

95
0:05:20.573,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I traveled every year across Japan with the Dalai Lama.

96
0:05:26.001,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And the one thing he said every day

97
0:05:29.125,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that most seemed to give people reassurance and confidence

98
0:05:32.696,000 --> 0:05:34,000
was, "I don't know."

99
0:05:36.325,000 --> 0:05:37,000
"What's going to happen to Tibet?"

100
0:05:39.226,000 --> 0:05:41,000
"When are we ever going to get world peace?"

101
0:05:42.765,000 --> 0:05:44,000
"What's the best way to raise children?"

102
0:05:46.134,000 --> 0:05:49,000
"Frankly," says this very wise man,

103
0:05:49.229,000 --> 0:05:5,000
"I don't know."

104
0:05:52.117,000 --> 0:05:55,000
The Nobel Prize-winning economist Daniel Kahneman

105
0:05:55.842,000 --> 0:05:59,000
has spent more than 60 years now researching human behavior,

106
0:06:00.369,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and his conclusion is

107
0:06:02.425,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that we are always much more confident of what we think we know

108
0:06:07.063,000 --> 0:06:08,000
than we should be.

109
0:06:08.812,000 --> 0:06:1,000
We have, as he memorably puts it,

110
0:06:11.495,000 --> 0:06:15,000
an "unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance."

111
0:06:16.849,000 --> 0:06:21,000
We know -- quote, unquote -- our team is going to win this weekend,

112
0:06:21.96,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and we only remember that knowledge

113
0:06:24.153,000 --> 0:06:26,000
on the rare occasions when we're right.

114
0:06:27.582,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Most of the time, we're in the dark.

115
0:06:31.319,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And that's where real intimacy lies.

116
0:06:36.58,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Do you know what your lover is going to do tomorrow?

117
0:06:40.673,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Do you want to know?

118
0:06:43.621,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The parents of us all, as some people call them,

119
0:06:46.458,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Adam and Eve,

120
0:06:47.641,000 --> 0:06:51,000
could never die, so long as they were eating from the tree of life.

121
0:06:52.631,000 --> 0:06:54,000
But the minute they began nibbling

122
0:06:54.853,000 --> 0:06:56,000
from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,

123
0:06:57.459,000 --> 0:06:58,000
they fell from their innocence.

124
0:06:59.808,000 --> 0:07:02,000
They grew embarrassed and fretful,

125
0:07:02.857,000 --> 0:07:03,000
self-conscious.

126
0:07:04.865,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And they learned, a little too late, perhaps,

127
0:07:07.257,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that there are certainly some things that we need to know,

128
0:07:10.021,000 --> 0:07:13,000
but there are many, many more that are better left unexplored.

129
0:07:15.999,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Now, when I was a kid,

130
0:07:17.948,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I knew it all, of course.

131
0:07:21.29,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I had been spending 20 years in classrooms collecting facts,

132
0:07:25.526,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and I was actually in the information business,

133
0:07:28.269,000 --> 0:07:3,000
writing articles for Time Magazine.

134
0:07:31.129,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And I took my first real trip to Japan for two-and-a-half weeks,

135
0:07:36.329,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and I came back with a 40-page essay

136
0:07:39.633,000 --> 0:07:42,000
explaining every last detail about Japan's temples,

137
0:07:43.221,000 --> 0:07:45,000
its fashions, its baseball games,

138
0:07:46.49,000 --> 0:07:47,000
its soul.

139
0:07:49.276,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But underneath all that,

140
0:07:51.63,000 --> 0:07:54,000
something that I couldn't understand

141
0:07:54.831,000 --> 0:07:58,000
so moved me for reasons I couldn't explain to you yet,

142
0:08:00.087,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that I decided to go and live in Japan.

143
0:08:04.45,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And now that I've been there for 28 years,

144
0:08:07.225,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I really couldn't tell you very much at all

145
0:08:09.649,000 --> 0:08:1,000
about my adopted home.

146
0:08:12.222,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Which is wonderful,

147
0:08:13.593,000 --> 0:08:15,000
because it means every day I'm making some new discovery,

148
0:08:16.497,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and in the process,

149
0:08:18.012,000 --> 0:08:21,000
looking around the corner and seeing the hundred thousand things

150
0:08:21.93,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I'll never know.

151
0:08:24.964,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Knowledge is a priceless gift.

152
0:08:28.452,000 --> 0:08:32,000
But the illusion of knowledge can be more dangerous than ignorance.

153
0:08:33.895,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Thinking that you know your lover

154
0:08:37.115,000 --> 0:08:38,000
or your enemy

155
0:08:38.621,000 --> 0:08:39,000
can be more treacherous

156
0:08:40.1,000 --> 0:08:42,000
than acknowledging you'll never know them.

157
0:08:43.937,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Every morning in Japan, as the sun is flooding into our little apartment,

158
0:08:48.433,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I take great pains not to consult the weather forecast,

159
0:08:52.815,000 --> 0:08:53,000
because if I do,

160
0:08:54.477,000 --> 0:08:57,000
my mind will be overclouded, distracted,

161
0:08:57.764,000 --> 0:08:59,000
even when the day is bright.

162
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I've been a full-time writer now for 34 years.

163
0:09:06.816,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And the one thing that I have learned

164
0:09:09.72,000 --> 0:09:12,000
is that transformation comes when I'm not in charge,

165
0:09:13.28,000 --> 0:09:15,000
when I don't know what's coming next,

166
0:09:15.481,000 --> 0:09:19,000
when I can't assume I am bigger than everything around me.

167
0:09:21.191,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And the same is true in love

168
0:09:23.643,000 --> 0:09:25,000
or in moments of crisis.

169
0:09:26.929,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Suddenly, we're back in that trishaw again

170
0:09:30.395,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and we're bumping off the broad, well-lit streets;

171
0:09:34.454,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and we're reminded, really, of the first law of travel

172
0:09:38.142,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and, therefore, of life:

173
0:09:41.09,000 --> 0:09:45,000
you're only as strong as your readiness to surrender.

174
0:09:47.512,000 --> 0:09:49,000
In the end, perhaps,

175
0:09:49.545,000 --> 0:09:5,000
being human

176
0:09:51.262,000 --> 0:09:52,000
is much more important

177
0:09:53.039,000 --> 0:09:55,000
than being fully in the know.

178
0:09:56.763,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Thank you.

179
0:09:57.973,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Applause)

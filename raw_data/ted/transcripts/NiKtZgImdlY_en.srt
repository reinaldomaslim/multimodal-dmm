0:00:13.1,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,

2
0:00:14.75,000 --> 0:00:17,000
in a 1968 speech where he reflects upon the Civil Rights Movement,

3
0:00:18.636,000 --> 0:00:2,000
states, "In the end,

4
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
we will remember not the words of our enemies

5
0:00:24.413,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but the silence of our friends."

6
0:00:27.28,000 --> 0:00:29,000
As a teacher, I've internalized this message.

7
0:00:29.8,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Every day, all around us,

8
0:00:31.78,000 --> 0:00:32,000
we see the consequences of silence

9
0:00:33.456,000 --> 0:00:35,000
manifest themselves in the form of discrimination,

10
0:00:35.893,000 --> 0:00:38,000
violence, genocide and war.

11
0:00:39.701,000 --> 0:00:41,000
In the classroom, I challenge my students

12
0:00:41.897,000 --> 0:00:43,000
to explore the silences in their own lives

13
0:00:44.328,000 --> 0:00:45,000
through poetry.

14
0:00:46.178,000 --> 0:00:47,000
We work together to fill those spaces,

15
0:00:48.03,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to recognize them, to name them,

16
0:00:51.308,000 --> 0:00:54,000
to understand that they don't have to be sources of shame.

17
0:00:54.74,000 --> 0:00:56,000
In an effort to create a culture within my classroom

18
0:00:57.203,000 --> 0:00:59,000
where students feel safe sharing the intimacies

19
0:00:59.301,000 --> 0:01:,000
of their own silences,

20
0:01:01.135,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I have four core principles posted on the board

21
0:01:03.216,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that sits in the front of my class,

22
0:01:05.309,000 --> 0:01:08,000
which every student signs at the beginning of the year:

23
0:01:08.37,000 --> 0:01:1,000
read critically, write consciously,

24
0:01:10.543,000 --> 0:01:13,000
speak clearly, tell your truth.

25
0:01:14.408,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And I find myself thinking a lot about that last point,

26
0:01:16.972,000 --> 0:01:17,000
tell your truth.

27
0:01:18.871,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And I realized that

28
0:01:20.665,000 --> 0:01:22,000
if I was going to ask my students to speak up,

29
0:01:22.876,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I was going to have to tell my truth

30
0:01:25.014,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and be honest with them about the times

31
0:01:27.28,000 --> 0:01:28,000
where I failed to do so.

32
0:01:28.848,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So I tell them that growing up,

33
0:01:30.908,000 --> 0:01:32,000
as a kid in a Catholic family in New Orleans,

34
0:01:33.576,000 --> 0:01:35,000
during Lent I was always taught

35
0:01:36.438,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that the most meaningful thing one could do

36
0:01:38.246,000 --> 0:01:39,000
was to give something up,

37
0:01:39.788,000 --> 0:01:41,000
sacrifice something you typically indulge in

38
0:01:42.08,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to prove to God you understand his sanctity.

39
0:01:44.479,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I've given up soda, McDonald's, French fries,

40
0:01:47.281,000 --> 0:01:49,000
French kisses, and everything in between.

41
0:01:50.183,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But one year, I gave up speaking.

42
0:01:54.071,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I figured the most valuable thing I could sacrifice

43
0:01:56.674,000 --> 0:01:59,000
was my own voice, but it was like I hadn't realized

44
0:02:00.375,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that I had given that up a long time ago.

45
0:02:03.286,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I spent so much of my life

46
0:02:05.105,000 --> 0:02:07,000
telling people the things they wanted to hear

47
0:02:07.282,000 --> 0:02:08,000
instead of the things they needed to,

48
0:02:08.758,000 --> 0:02:1,000
told myself I wasn't meant to be anyone's conscience

49
0:02:11.174,000 --> 0:02:13,000
because I still had to figure out being my own,

50
0:02:13.469,000 --> 0:02:16,000
so sometimes I just wouldn't say anything,

51
0:02:16.701,000 --> 0:02:18,000
appeasing ignorance with my silence,

52
0:02:19.15,000 --> 0:02:21,000
unaware that validation doesn't need words

53
0:02:21.547,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to endorse its existence.

54
0:02:23.167,000 --> 0:02:24,000
When Christian was beat up for being gay,

55
0:02:24.955,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I put my hands in my pocket

56
0:02:26.223,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and walked with my head down as if I didn't even notice.

57
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I couldn't use my locker for weeks because the bolt on the lock

58
0:02:31.535,000 --> 0:02:33,000
reminded me of the one I had put on my lips

59
0:02:33.796,000 --> 0:02:34,000
when the homeless man on the corner

60
0:02:35.54,000 --> 0:02:36,000
looked at me with eyes up merely searching

61
0:02:37.32,000 --> 0:02:39,000
for an affirmation that he was worth seeing.

62
0:02:39.502,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I was more concerned with touching the screen on my Apple

63
0:02:41.607,000 --> 0:02:42,000
than actually feeding him one.

64
0:02:43.17,000 --> 0:02:44,000
When the woman at the fundraising gala

65
0:02:44.857,000 --> 0:02:45,000
said "I'm so proud of you.

66
0:02:46.049,000 --> 0:02:49,000
It must be so hard teaching those poor, unintelligent kids,"

67
0:02:49.12,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I bit my lip, because apparently we needed her money

68
0:02:51.719,000 --> 0:02:52,000
more than my students needed their dignity.

69
0:02:53.699,000 --> 0:02:54,000
We spend so much time

70
0:02:55.64,000 --> 0:02:58,000
listening to the things people are saying

71
0:02:59.54,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that we rarely pay attention to the things they don't.

72
0:03:02.878,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Silence is the residue of fear.

73
0:03:06.139,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It is feeling your flaws

74
0:03:07.689,000 --> 0:03:08,000
gut-wrench guillotine your tongue.

75
0:03:09.615,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It is the air retreating from your chest

76
0:03:11.437,000 --> 0:03:12,000
because it doesn't feel safe in your lungs.

77
0:03:13.429,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Silence is Rwandan genocide. Silence is Katrina.

78
0:03:16.553,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It is what you hear when there aren't enough body bags left.

79
0:03:19.661,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It is the sound after the noose is already tied.

80
0:03:22.062,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It is charring. It is chains. It is privilege. It is pain.

81
0:03:25.409,000 --> 0:03:26,000
There is no time to pick your battles

82
0:03:27.164,000 --> 0:03:28,000
when your battles have already picked you.

83
0:03:28.897,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision.

84
0:03:31.96,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I will tell Christian that he is a lion,

85
0:03:33.927,000 --> 0:03:35,000
a sanctuary of bravery and brilliance.

86
0:03:36.287,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I will ask that homeless man what his name is

87
0:03:38.683,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and how his day was, because sometimes

88
0:03:40.393,000 --> 0:03:41,000
all people want to be is human.

89
0:03:42.34,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I will tell that woman that my students can talk about

90
0:03:44.826,000 --> 0:03:46,000
transcendentalism like their last name was Thoreau,

91
0:03:47.391,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and just because you watched one episode of "The Wire"

92
0:03:49.426,000 --> 0:03:51,000
doesn't mean you know anything about my kids.

93
0:03:51.665,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So this year,

94
0:03:53.338,000 --> 0:03:55,000
instead of giving something up,

95
0:03:55.485,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I will live every day as if there were a microphone

96
0:03:57.897,000 --> 0:03:58,000
tucked under my tongue,

97
0:03:59.82,000 --> 0:04:03,000
a stage on the underside of my inhibition.

98
0:04:03.825,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Because who has to have a soapbox

99
0:04:05.968,000 --> 0:04:09,000
when all you've ever needed is your voice?

100
0:04:10.207,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Thank you.

101
0:04:12.712,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Applause)

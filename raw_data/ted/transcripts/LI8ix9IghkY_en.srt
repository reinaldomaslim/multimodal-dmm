2
0:00:16.01,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm a very lucky person.

3
0:00:19.319,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I've been privileged to see so much of our beautiful Earth

4
0:00:23.797,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and the people and creatures that live on it.

5
0:00:26.125,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And my passion was inspired at the age of seven,

6
0:00:29.745,000 --> 0:00:31,000
when my parents first took me to Morocco,

7
0:00:32.08,000 --> 0:00:34,000
at the edge of the Sahara Desert.

8
0:00:34.206,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Now imagine a little Brit

9
0:00:36.581,000 --> 0:00:39,000
somewhere that wasn't cold and damp like home.

10
0:00:39.702,000 --> 0:00:41,000
What an amazing experience.

11
0:00:41.978,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And it made me want to explore more.

12
0:00:44.471,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So as a filmmaker,

13
0:00:47.074,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I've been from one end of the Earth to the other

14
0:00:49.885,000 --> 0:00:51,000
trying to get the perfect shot

15
0:00:52.593,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and to capture animal behavior never seen before.

16
0:00:56.385,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And what's more, I'm really lucky,

17
0:00:59.017,000 --> 0:01:02,000
because I get to share that with millions of people worldwide.

18
0:01:02.135,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet

19
0:01:07.385,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and actually being able to get that message out

20
0:01:11.218,000 --> 0:01:13,000
gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step.

21
0:01:14.076,000 --> 0:01:17,000
You might think that it's quite hard

22
0:01:17.218,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to find new stories and new subjects,

23
0:01:19.468,000 --> 0:01:23,000
but new technology is changing the way we can film.

24
0:01:23.799,000 --> 0:01:26,000
It's enabling us to get fresh, new images

25
0:01:27.635,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and tell brand new stories.

26
0:01:29.752,000 --> 0:01:31,000
In Nature's Great Events,

27
0:01:32.635,000 --> 0:01:35,000
a series for the BBC that I did with David Attenborough,

28
0:01:36.177,000 --> 0:01:38,000
we wanted to do just that.

29
0:01:38.427,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Images of grizzly bears are pretty familiar.

30
0:01:41.468,000 --> 0:01:44,000
You see them all the time, you think.

31
0:01:44.718,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But there's a whole side to their lives that we hardly ever see

32
0:01:48.802,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and had never been filmed.

33
0:01:50.51,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So what we did, we went to Alaska,

34
0:01:54.76,000 --> 0:01:56,000
which is where the grizzlies rely

35
0:01:57.128,000 --> 0:01:59,000
on really high, almost inaccessible, mountain slopes

36
0:02:00.114,000 --> 0:02:01,000
for their denning.

37
0:02:02.049,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And the only way to film that is a shoot from the air.

38
0:02:09.564,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Video) David Attenborough: Throughout Alaska and British Columbia,

39
0:02:14.177,000 --> 0:02:19,000
thousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep.

40
0:02:19.389,000 --> 0:02:22,000
There is nothing to eat up here,

41
0:02:23.343,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but the conditions were ideal for hibernation.

42
0:02:26.843,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Lots of snow in which to dig a den.

43
0:02:34.71,000 --> 0:02:39,000
To find food, mothers must lead their cubs down to the coast,

44
0:02:40.7,000 --> 0:02:42,000
where the snow will already be melting.

45
0:02:47.762,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But getting down can be a challenge for small cubs.

46
0:03:20.983,000 --> 0:03:23,000
These mountains are dangerous places,

47
0:03:24.718,000 --> 0:03:27,000
but ultimately the fate of these bear families,

48
0:03:28.177,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and indeed that of all bears around the North Pacific,

49
0:03:31.691,000 --> 0:03:35,000
depends on the salmon.

50
0:03:36.324,000 --> 0:03:38,000
KB: I love that shot.

51
0:03:38.885,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I always get goosebumps every time I see it.

52
0:03:41.177,000 --> 0:03:43,000
That was filmed from a helicopter

53
0:03:43.218,000 --> 0:03:45,000
using a gyro-stabilized camera.

54
0:03:46.01,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And it's a wonderful bit of gear,

55
0:03:48.468,000 --> 0:03:51,000
because it's like having a flying tripod, crane and dolly all rolled into one.

56
0:03:52.427,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But technology alone isn't enough.

57
0:03:55.635,000 --> 0:03:57,000
To really get the money shots,

58
0:03:58.135,000 --> 0:04:01,000
it's down to being in the right place at the right time.

59
0:04:01.177,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And that sequence was especially difficult.

60
0:04:04.135,000 --> 0:04:07,000
The first year we got nothing.

61
0:04:07.635,000 --> 0:04:1,000
We had to go back the following year,

62
0:04:11.218,000 --> 0:04:14,000
all the way back to the remote parts of Alaska.

63
0:04:14.218,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And we hung around with a helicopter for two whole weeks.

64
0:04:16.843,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And eventually we got lucky.

65
0:04:19.885,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The cloud lifted, the wind was still,

66
0:04:24.218,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and even the bear showed up.

67
0:04:25.968,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And we managed to get that magic moment.

68
0:04:28.552,000 --> 0:04:29,000
For a filmmaker,

69
0:04:30.427,000 --> 0:04:34,000
new technology is an amazing tool,

70
0:04:34.6,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but the other thing that really, really excites me

71
0:04:37.806,000 --> 0:04:39,000
is when new species are discovered.

72
0:04:40.76,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Now, when I heard about one animal,

73
0:04:43.047,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I knew we had to get it for my next series,

74
0:04:46.01,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Untamed Americas, for National Geographic.

75
0:04:48.76,000 --> 0:04:54,000
In 2005, a new species of bat was discovered

76
0:04:55.071,000 --> 0:04:57,000
in the cloud forests of Ecuador.

77
0:04:57.343,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And what was amazing about that discovery

78
0:04:59.427,000 --> 0:05:01,000
is that it also solved the mystery

79
0:05:01.843,000 --> 0:05:04,000
of what pollinated a unique flower.

80
0:05:04.88,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It depends solely on the bat.

81
0:05:06.843,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Now, the series hasn't even aired yet,

82
0:05:09.577,000 --> 0:05:11,000
so you're the very first to see this.

83
0:05:12.004,000 --> 0:05:13,000
See what you think.

84
0:05:16.85,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Video) Narrator: The tube-lipped nectar bat.

85
0:05:25.796,000 --> 0:05:27,000
A pool of delicious nectar

86
0:05:28.137,000 --> 0:05:3,000
lies at the bottom of each flower's long flute.

87
0:05:30.302,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But how to reach it?

88
0:05:35.147,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Necessity is the mother of evolution.

89
0:05:40.343,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Music)

90
0:06:03.749,000 --> 0:06:06,000
This two-and-a-half-inch bat

91
0:06:06.756,000 --> 0:06:12,000
has a three-and-a-half-inch tongue,

92
0:06:13.481,000 --> 0:06:16,000
the longest relative to body length

93
0:06:17.379,000 --> 0:06:19,000
of any mammal in the world.

94
0:06:19.698,000 --> 0:06:26,000
If human, he'd have a nine-foot tongue.

95
0:06:31.382,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Applause)

96
0:06:33.872,000 --> 0:06:35,000
KB: What a tongue.

97
0:06:35.937,000 --> 0:06:39,000
We filmed it by cutting a tiny little hole in the base of the flower

98
0:06:40.802,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and using a camera that could slow the action by 40 times.

99
0:06:45.427,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So imagine how quick that thing is in real life.

100
0:06:48.51,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Now people often ask me, "Where's your favorite place on the planet?"

101
0:06:53.722,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And the truth is I just don't have one.

102
0:06:56.255,000 --> 0:06:58,000
There are so many wonderful places.

103
0:06:58.802,000 --> 0:07:01,000
But some locations draw you back time and time again.

104
0:07:02.302,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And one remote location --

105
0:07:05.05,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I first went there as a backpacker;

106
0:07:07.07,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I've been back several times for filming,

107
0:07:09.385,000 --> 0:07:1,000
most recently for Untamed Americas --

108
0:07:11.135,000 --> 0:07:15,000
it's the Altiplano in the high Andes of South America,

109
0:07:15.885,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and it's the most otherworldly place I know.

110
0:07:21.052,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But at 15,000 feet, it's tough.

111
0:07:24.154,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It's freezing cold,

112
0:07:25.677,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and that thin air really gets you.

113
0:07:30.343,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Sometimes it's hard to breathe,

114
0:07:32.654,000 --> 0:07:35,000
especially carrying all the heavy filming equipment.

115
0:07:35.697,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover.

116
0:07:40.302,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere

117
0:07:44.593,000 --> 0:07:47,000
is that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens

118
0:07:48.531,000 --> 0:07:5,000
with amazing clarity.

119
0:07:50.97,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Have a look.

120
0:07:55.156,000 --> 0:07:58,000
(Video) Narrator: Some 1,500 miles south of the tropics,

121
0:07:58.812,000 --> 0:07:59,000
between Chile and Bolivia,

122
0:08:00.497,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the Andes completely change.

123
0:08:05.673,000 --> 0:08:09,000
It's called the Altiplano, or "high plains" --

124
0:08:10.302,000 --> 0:08:13,000
a place of extremes

125
0:08:14.185,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and extreme contrasts.

126
0:08:17.874,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Where deserts freeze

127
0:08:22.385,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and waters boil.

128
0:08:26.218,000 --> 0:08:29,000
More like Mars than Earth,

129
0:08:29.718,000 --> 0:08:31,000
it seems just as hostile to life.

130
0:08:40.456,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The stars themselves --

131
0:08:50.325,000 --> 0:08:53,000
at 12,000 feet, the dry, thin air

132
0:08:54.046,000 --> 0:09:02,000
makes for perfect stargazing.

133
0:09:02.189,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Some of the world's astronomers have telescopes nearby.

134
0:09:08.073,000 --> 0:09:12,000
But just looking up with the naked eye,

135
0:09:12.145,000 --> 0:09:15,000
you really don't need one.

136
0:09:15.39,000 --> 0:10:02,000
(Music)

137
0:10:02.4,000 --> 0:10:08,000
(Applause)

138
0:10:08.427,000 --> 0:10:11,000
KB: Thank you so much

139
0:10:11.744,000 --> 0:10:13,000
for letting me share some images

140
0:10:14.218,000 --> 0:10:16,000
of our magnificent, wonderful Earth.

141
0:10:17.127,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Thank you for letting me share that with you.

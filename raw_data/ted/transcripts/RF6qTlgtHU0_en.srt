2
0:00:15.686,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Good afternoon.

3
0:00:17.007,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I am not a farmer.

4
0:00:19.95,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:20.885,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I'm not. I'm a parent, I'm a resident and I'm a teacher.

6
0:00:24.437,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And this is my world.

7
0:00:25.999,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And along the way I've started noticing --

8
0:00:27.612,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I'm on my third generation of kids --

9
0:00:29.081,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that they're getting bigger.

10
0:00:30.334,000 --> 0:00:31,000
They're getting sicker.

11
0:00:31.493,000 --> 0:00:32,000
In addition to these complexities,

12
0:00:33.477,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I just learned that 70 percent of the kids that I see

13
0:00:35.39,000 --> 0:00:37,000
who are labeled learning disabled would not have been

14
0:00:37.4,000 --> 0:00:39,000
had they had proper prenatal nutrition.

15
0:00:39.757,000 --> 0:00:42,000
The realities of my community are simple. They look like this.

16
0:00:43.433,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Kids should not have to grow up and look at things like this.

17
0:00:46.167,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And as jobs continue to leave my community,

18
0:00:48.309,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and energy continues to come in, be exported in,

19
0:00:51.252,000 --> 0:00:56,000
it's no wonder that really some people refer to the South Bronx as a desert.

20
0:00:56.587,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But I'm the oldest sixth grader you'll ever meet,

21
0:00:59.187,000 --> 0:01:01,000
so I get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm

22
0:01:01.82,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that I'm hoping to share with you all today.

23
0:01:04.156,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And with that note, I come to you with this belief

24
0:01:07.633,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that kids should not have to leave their communities

25
0:01:10.107,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to live, learn and earn in a better one.

26
0:01:11.488,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So I'm here to tell you a story about me

27
0:01:13.126,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and this wall that I met outside, which I'm now bringing inside.

28
0:01:16.647,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And it starts with three people.

29
0:01:18.39,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The crazy teacher -- that's me on the left,

30
0:01:20.468,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I dress up pretty, thank you, my wife, I love you for getting a good suit --

31
0:01:23.846,000 --> 0:01:24,000
my passionate borough president

32
0:01:25.51,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and a guy named George Irwin from Green Living Technologies

33
0:01:28.055,000 --> 0:01:29,000
who helped me with my class

34
0:01:29.319,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and helped me get involved with this patented technology.

35
0:01:31.806,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But it all starts with seeds in classrooms,

36
0:01:34.67,000 --> 0:01:36,000
in my place, which looks like this.

37
0:01:37.326,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And I'm here today hoping that my reach will exceed my grasp.

38
0:01:42.979,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And that's really what this is all about.

39
0:01:44.678,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And it starts with incredible kids like this,

40
0:01:46.414,000 --> 0:01:47,000
who come early and stay late.

41
0:01:48.135,000 --> 0:01:5,000
All of my kids are either IEP or ELL learners,

42
0:01:51.103,000 --> 0:01:52,000
most come with a lot of handicaps,

43
0:01:52.862,000 --> 0:01:54,000
most are homeless and many are in foster care.

44
0:01:55.415,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Almost all of my kids live below poverty.

45
0:01:57.666,000 --> 0:02:,000
But with those seeds, from day one, we are growing in my classroom,

46
0:02:01.087,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and this is what it looks like in my classroom.

47
0:02:03.278,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds.

48
0:02:05.879,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And then you notice that those seeds become farms across the Bronx that look like this.

49
0:02:10.318,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But again, I am not a farmer. I'm a teacher.

50
0:02:14.535,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And I don't like weeding, and I don't like back-breaking labor.

51
0:02:17.191,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So I wanted to figure out how I could get this kind of success

52
0:02:19.319,000 --> 0:02:21,000
into something small, like this,

53
0:02:21.687,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it,

54
0:02:24.479,000 --> 0:02:25,000
kids who didn't want to be outside could do it,

55
0:02:26.201,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and everyone could have access.

56
0:02:27.501,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So I called George Irwin, and what do you know?

57
0:02:29.634,000 --> 0:02:32,000
He came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall.

58
0:02:33.295,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And what we do is we partner it with authentic learning experiences,

59
0:02:36.643,000 --> 0:02:37,000
private-based learning.

60
0:02:38.35,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And lo and behold, we gave birth to

61
0:02:40.974,000 --> 0:02:42,000
the first edible wall in New York City.

62
0:02:43.222,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So if you're hungry, get up and eat.

63
0:02:44.382,000 --> 0:02:45,000
You can do it right now. My kids play cow all the time.

64
0:02:46.206,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Okay? But we were just getting started,

65
0:02:49.558,000 --> 0:02:5,000
the kids loved the technology,

66
0:02:50.927,000 --> 0:02:52,000
so we called up George and we said, "We gotta learn more!"

67
0:02:53.272,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Now, Mayor Bloomberg, thank you very much, we no longer need work permits,

68
0:02:56.127,000 --> 0:02:58,000
which comes with slices and bonded contractors -- we're available for you --

69
0:02:58.904,000 --> 0:03:,000
We decided to go to Boston.

70
0:03:00.91,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And my kids, from the poorest congressional district in America,

71
0:03:03.336,000 --> 0:03:06,000
became the first to install a green wall,

72
0:03:06.601,000 --> 0:03:08,000
designed by a computer, with real-live learning tools,

73
0:03:08.886,000 --> 0:03:09,000
21 stories up -- if you're going to go visit it,

74
0:03:10.435,000 --> 0:03:12,000
it's on top of the John Hancock building.

75
0:03:12.494,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But closer to home, we started installing these walls in schools

76
0:03:15.286,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that look like this with lighting like that,

77
0:03:17.206,000 --> 0:03:2,000
real LED stuff, 21st-century technology.

78
0:03:20.295,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And what do you know? We made 21st century money,

79
0:03:22.614,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and that was groundbreaking. Wow!

80
0:03:25.433,000 --> 0:03:27,000
This is my harvest, people.

81
0:03:28.245,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And what do you do with this food? You cook it!

82
0:03:31.002,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And those are my heirloom students making heirloom sauce,

83
0:03:33.906,000 --> 0:03:35,000
with plastic forks, and we get it into the cafeteria,

84
0:03:36.368,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and we grow stuff and we feed our teachers.

85
0:03:38.568,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And that is the youngest nationally certified

86
0:03:40.779,000 --> 0:03:42,000
workforce in America with our Bronx Borough President.

87
0:03:43.602,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And what'd we do then? Well, I met nice people like you,

88
0:03:46.506,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and they invited us to the Hamptons.

89
0:03:48.243,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So I call this "from South Bronx to Southampton."

90
0:03:50.514,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And we started putting in roofs that look like this,

91
0:03:53.019,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and we came in from destitute neighborhoods

92
0:03:55.307,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to start building landscape like this, wow! People noticed.

93
0:03:58.875,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And so we got invited back this past summer,

94
0:04:00.869,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and we actually moved into the Hamptons,

95
0:04:02.628,000 --> 0:04:04,000
payed 3,500 dollars a week for a house, and we learned how to surf.

96
0:04:05.451,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And when you can do stuff like this --

97
0:04:08.227,000 --> 0:04:11,000
These are my kids putting in this technology,

98
0:04:11.443,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and when you can build a roof that looks like that

99
0:04:13.98,000 --> 0:04:15,000
on a house that looks like that

100
0:04:16.394,000 --> 0:04:18,000
with sedum that looks like this,

101
0:04:19.204,000 --> 0:04:21,000
this is the new green graffiti.

102
0:04:21.946,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So, you may wonder what does a wall like this

103
0:04:25.451,000 --> 0:04:27,000
really do for kids, besides changing landscapes and mindsets?

104
0:04:28.011,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Okay, I'm going to tell you what it does.

105
0:04:29.907,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It gets me to meet incredible contractors like this,

106
0:04:32.227,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Jim Ellenberger from Ellenberger Services.

107
0:04:34.379,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And this is where it becomes true triple bottom line.

108
0:04:37.112,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Because Jim realized that these kids, my future farmers,

109
0:04:40.601,000 --> 0:04:42,000
really had the skills he needed to build affordable housing

110
0:04:43.485,000 --> 0:04:45,000
for New Yorkers, right in their own neighborhood.

111
0:04:45.683,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And this is what my kids are doing, making living wage.

112
0:04:48.027,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Now, if you're like me, you live in a building, there are seven guys

113
0:04:50.867,000 --> 0:04:52,000
out of work looking to manage a million dollars.

114
0:04:52.882,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I don't have it. But if you need a toilet fixed

115
0:04:55.291,000 --> 0:04:57,000
or, you know, some shelving, I gotta wait six months

116
0:04:57.302,000 --> 0:04:59,000
for an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me.

117
0:04:59.755,000 --> 0:05:,000
That's the beauty of this economy.

118
0:05:01.534,000 --> 0:05:04,000
But my kids are now licensed and bonded in trade.

119
0:05:04.868,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And that's my first student to open up, the first in his family to have a bank account.

120
0:05:07.844,000 --> 0:05:1,000
This immigrant student is the first one in his family to use an ATM.

121
0:05:11.253,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And this is the true triple bottom line,

122
0:05:13.635,000 --> 0:05:15,000
because we can take neighborhoods that were abandoned and destitute

123
0:05:15.89,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and turn them into something like this with interiors like this.

124
0:05:18.811,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Wow! People noticed. And notice they did.

125
0:05:20.89,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So CNN called, and we were delighted to have them come to our farmer's market.

126
0:05:24.386,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And then when Rockefeller Center said, NBC,

127
0:05:26.954,000 --> 0:05:27,000
could you put this thing up on the walls? We were delighted.

128
0:05:28.858,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But this, I show you, when kids from the poorest congressional district in America

129
0:05:32.85,000 --> 0:05:34,000
can build a 30-foot by 15-foot wall,

130
0:05:35.57,000 --> 0:05:38,000
design it, plant it and install it in the heart of New York City,

131
0:05:38.735,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that's a true "sí se puede" moment.

132
0:05:40.754,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Really scholastic, if you ask me.

133
0:05:43.139,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But this is not a Getty image.

134
0:05:45.41,000 --> 0:05:47,000
That's a picture I took of my Bronx Borough President,

135
0:05:47.986,000 --> 0:05:5,000
addressing my kids in his house, not the jailhouse,

136
0:05:51.201,000 --> 0:05:52,000
making them feel a part of it.

137
0:05:52.748,000 --> 0:05:54,000
That's our State Senator Gustavo Rivera and Bob Bieder,

138
0:05:55.102,000 --> 0:05:57,000
coming to my classroom to make my kids feel important.

139
0:05:57.702,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And when the Bronx Borough President shows up

140
0:05:59.42,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and the State Senator comes to our class,

141
0:06:01.602,000 --> 0:06:04,000
believe you me, the Bronx can change attitudes now.

142
0:06:05.346,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We are poised, ready, willing and able

143
0:06:06.868,000 --> 0:06:09,000
to export our talent and diversity in ways we've never even imagined.

144
0:06:10.068,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And when the local senator gets on the scale in public

145
0:06:12.134,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and says he's got to lose weight, so do I!

146
0:06:15.347,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And I tell you what, I'm doing it and so are the kids.

147
0:06:18.212,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Okay? And then celebrities started.

148
0:06:20.29,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Produce Pete can't believe what we grow.

149
0:06:22.306,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Lorna Sass came and donated books.

150
0:06:24.522,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Okay? We're feeding seniors.

151
0:06:26.754,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And when we realized that we were growing for food justice in the South Bronx,

152
0:06:30.315,000 --> 0:06:31,000
so did the international community.

153
0:06:32.2,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And my kids in the South Bronx were repped in

154
0:06:33.77,000 --> 0:06:35,000
the first international green roof conference.

155
0:06:35.946,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And that's just great.

156
0:06:37.378,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Except what about locally?

157
0:06:38.989,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Well, we met this woman, Avis Richards, with the Ground Up Campaign.

158
0:06:42.053,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Unbelievable! Through her, my kids,

159
0:06:44.413,000 --> 0:06:46,000
the most disenfranchised and marginalized,

160
0:06:46.541,000 --> 0:06:49,000
were able to roll out 100 gardens to New York City public schools.

161
0:06:50.31,000 --> 0:06:52,000
That's triple bottom line! Okay?

162
0:06:53.167,000 --> 0:06:55,000
A year ago today, I was invited to the New York Academy of Medicine.

163
0:06:56.102,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy New York

164
0:06:59.566,000 --> 0:07:01,000
made sense, especially when the resources were free.

165
0:07:02.277,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So thank you all and I love them.

166
0:07:04.053,000 --> 0:07:07,000
They introduced me to the New York City Strategic Alliance for Health,

167
0:07:07.071,000 --> 0:07:09,000
again, free resources, don't waste them.

168
0:07:10.035,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And what do you know? Six months later,

169
0:07:12.181,000 --> 0:07:15,000
my school and my kids were awarded the first ever

170
0:07:15.28,000 --> 0:07:18,000
high school award of excellence for creating a healthy school environment.

171
0:07:18.967,000 --> 0:07:2,000
The greenest class in New York City.

172
0:07:21.093,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But more importantly is my kids learned to get,

173
0:07:23.535,000 --> 0:07:24,000
they learned to give.

174
0:07:25.168,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And we took the money that we made from our farmer's market,

175
0:07:27.637,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and started buying gifts for the homeless

176
0:07:29.085,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and for needy around the world.

177
0:07:30.525,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So we started giving back.

178
0:07:31.935,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And that's when I realized that the greening of America

179
0:07:34.434,000 --> 0:07:37,000
starts first with the pockets, then with the heart

180
0:07:37.669,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and then with the mind.

181
0:07:38.887,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So we were onto something, and we're still onto something.

182
0:07:41.218,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And thank God Trinity Wall Street noticed,

183
0:07:43.052,000 --> 0:07:46,000
because they gave us the birth of Green Bronx Machine.

184
0:07:46.285,000 --> 0:07:47,000
We're 3,000 strong right now.

185
0:07:48.092,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And what does it really do?

186
0:07:49.413,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It teaches kids to re-vision their communities,

187
0:07:51.447,000 --> 0:07:54,000
so when they grow up in places like this, they can imagine it like this.

188
0:07:54.493,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And my kids, trained and certified --

189
0:07:56.636,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Ma, you get the tax abatement. Thank you, Mayor Bloomberg --

190
0:07:58.628,000 --> 0:08:01,000
can take communities that look like this and convert them into things that look like that,

191
0:08:02.335,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and that to me, people, is another true "sí se puede" moment.

192
0:08:05.724,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Now, how does it start? It starts in schools.

193
0:08:07.804,000 --> 0:08:08,000
No more little Knicks and little Nets.

194
0:08:09.524,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Group by broccoli, group by your favorite vegetable,

195
0:08:12.934,000 --> 0:08:13,000
something you can aspire to.

196
0:08:14.565,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Okay? And these are my future farmers of America,

197
0:08:16.612,000 --> 0:08:18,000
growing up in Brook Park on 141st Street,

198
0:08:19.085,000 --> 0:08:2,000
the most migrant community in America.

199
0:08:20.812,000 --> 0:08:22,000
When tenacious little ones learn how to garden like this,

200
0:08:22.9,000 --> 0:08:24,000
it's no wonder we get fruit like that.

201
0:08:25.261,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And I love it! And so do they.

202
0:08:27.252,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And we're building teepees in neighborhoods that were burning down.

203
0:08:30.167,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And that's a true "sí se puede" moment.

204
0:08:32.54,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And again, Brook Park feeds hundreds of people

205
0:08:35.917,000 --> 0:08:37,000
without a food stamp or a fingerprint.

206
0:08:38.335,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The poorest congressional district in America,

207
0:08:40.388,000 --> 0:08:43,000
the most migratory community in America, we can do this.

208
0:08:43.572,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Bissel Gardens is cranking out food in epic proportions,

209
0:08:47.276,000 --> 0:08:49,000
moving kids into an economy they never imagined.

210
0:08:49.58,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Now, somewhere over the rainbow, my friends,

211
0:08:52.044,000 --> 0:08:55,000
is the South Bronx of America. And we're doing it.

212
0:08:55.772,000 --> 0:08:57,000
How does it start? Well, look at Jose's attention to detail.

213
0:08:58.627,000 --> 0:09:,000
Thank God Omar knows that carrots come from the ground,

214
0:09:01.268,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and not aisle 9 at the supermarket

215
0:09:02.844,000 --> 0:09:04,000
or through a bullet-proof window or through a piece of styrofoam.

216
0:09:05.635,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And when Henry knows that green is good, so do I.

217
0:09:08.335,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And when you expand their palates, you expand their vocabulary.

218
0:09:11.389,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And most importantly, when you put big kids together with little kids,

219
0:09:15.022,000 --> 0:09:17,000
you get the big fat white guy out of the middle, which is cool,

220
0:09:17.369,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and you create this kind of accountability amongst peers, which is incredible.

221
0:09:20.801,000 --> 0:09:22,000
God, I'm going to run out of time, so I've gotta keep it moving.

222
0:09:23.39,000 --> 0:09:26,000
But this is my weekly paycheck for kids; that's our green graffiti.

223
0:09:26.59,000 --> 0:09:27,000
This is what we're doing.

224
0:09:28.255,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And behold the glory and bounty that is Bronx County.

225
0:09:32.734,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Nothing thrills me more than to see kids pollinating plants instead of each other.

226
0:09:36.077,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I gotta tell you, I'm a protective parent.

227
0:09:38.237,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But those kids are the kids who are now putting

228
0:09:39.778,000 --> 0:09:4,000
pumpkin patches on top of trains.

229
0:09:41.654,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We're also designing coin ponds for the rich and affluent.

230
0:09:44.495,000 --> 0:09:45,000
We're also becoming children of the corn,

231
0:09:46.201,000 --> 0:09:48,000
creating farms in the middle of Fordham Road for awareness

232
0:09:48.805,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and window bottles out of garbage.

233
0:09:50.358,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Now I don't expect every kid to be a farmer,

234
0:09:52.157,000 --> 0:09:55,000
but I expect you to read about it, write about it, blog about it, offer outstanding customer service.

235
0:09:55.518,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I expect them to be engaged, and man, are they!

236
0:09:58.005,000 --> 0:10:,000
So that's my incredible classroom, that's the food.

237
0:10:00.389,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Where does it go? Zero miles to plate, right down into the cafeteria.

238
0:10:04.189,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Or more importantly, to local shelters,

239
0:10:06.268,000 --> 0:10:08,000
where most of our kids are getting one to two meals a day.

240
0:10:08.621,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And we're stepping it up.

241
0:10:10.309,000 --> 0:10:12,000
No Air Jordans were ever ruined on my farm.

242
0:10:12.871,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And in his day, a million dollar gardens and incredible installations.

243
0:10:16.15,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Let me tell you something, people.

244
0:10:17.79,000 --> 0:10:2,000
This is a beautiful moment.

245
0:10:21.696,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Black field, brown field, toxic waste field, battlefield --

246
0:10:24.881,000 --> 0:10:26,000
we're proving in the Bronx that you can grow anywhere, on cement.

247
0:10:27.736,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And we take orders for flowers. I'm putting the bake sale to shame.

248
0:10:31.657,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We take orders now. I'm booking for the spring.

249
0:10:33.689,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And these were all grown from seeds. We're learning everything.

250
0:10:37.057,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And again, when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse

251
0:10:39.953,000 --> 0:10:41,000
as this to do something as special as this,

252
0:10:42.01,000 --> 0:10:43,000
we're really creating a moment.

253
0:10:43.734,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Now, you may ask about these kids.

254
0:10:46.45,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Forty percent attendance to 93 percent attendance.

255
0:10:49.631,000 --> 0:10:51,000
All start overage and under-credit.

256
0:10:52.52,000 --> 0:10:55,000
They are now, my first cohort is all in college, earning a living wage.

257
0:10:56.456,000 --> 0:10:58,000
The rest are scheduled to graduate this June.

258
0:10:58.737,000 --> 0:11:,000
Happy kids, happy families, happy colleagues.

259
0:11:01.689,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Amazed people. The glory and bounty that is Bronx County.

260
0:11:05.825,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Let's talk about mint. Where is my mint?

261
0:11:08.088,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I grow seven kinds of mint in my class.

262
0:11:10.276,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Mojitos, anybody? I'll be at Telepan later.

263
0:11:12.427,000 --> 0:11:15,000
But, understand this is my intellectual Viagra.

264
0:11:15.622,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I gotta move quick, but understand this:

265
0:11:18.822,000 --> 0:11:2,000
The borough that gave us baggy pants and funky fresh beats

266
0:11:21.558,000 --> 0:11:23,000
is becoming home to the organic ones.

267
0:11:23.71,000 --> 0:11:25,000
My green [unclear] 25,000 pounds of vegetables,

268
0:11:26.646,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I'm growing organic citizens, engaged kids.

269
0:11:29.958,000 --> 0:11:31,000
So help us go from this to this.

270
0:11:32.668,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Self-sustaining entities, 18 months return on investment,

271
0:11:35.958,000 --> 0:11:37,000
plus we're paying people living wage and health benefits,

272
0:11:38.15,000 --> 0:11:39,000
while feeding people for pennies on the dollar.

273
0:11:40.006,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Martin Luther King said that people need to be uplifted with dignity.

274
0:11:43.622,000 --> 0:11:46,000
So here in New York, I urge you, my fellow Americans,

275
0:11:46.887,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to help us make America great again.

276
0:11:49.534,000 --> 0:11:5,000
It's simple. Share your passion.

277
0:11:51.478,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It's real easy. Go see these two videos, please.

278
0:11:53.903,000 --> 0:11:55,000
One got us invited to the White House, one's a recent incarnation.

279
0:11:56.802,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And most importantly, get the biggest bully out of schools.

280
0:11:59.436,000 --> 0:12:01,000
This has got to go tomorrow.

281
0:12:01.541,000 --> 0:12:03,000
People, you can all do that.

282
0:12:03.602,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Keep kids out of stores that look like this.

283
0:12:06.838,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Make them a healthy plate,

284
0:12:08.535,000 --> 0:12:1,000
especially if you can pick it off the wall in your own classroom -- delicioso!

285
0:12:11.286,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Model good behavior. Get them to a green cart.

286
0:12:14.622,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Big kids love strawberries and bananas.

287
0:12:16.838,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Teach them entrepreneurship. Thank God for GrowNYC.

288
0:12:19.854,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Let them cook. Great lunch today, let them do culinary things.

289
0:12:23.086,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But most importantly, just love them.

290
0:12:25.005,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Nothing works like unconditional love.

291
0:12:27.319,000 --> 0:12:3,000
So, my good friend Kermit said it's not easy being green.

292
0:12:30.526,000 --> 0:12:32,000
It's not. I come from a place where kids can buy

293
0:12:33.21,000 --> 0:12:36,000
35 flavors of blunt wrap at any day of the moment,

294
0:12:36.235,000 --> 0:12:38,000
where ice cream freezers are filled with slushy malt liquor.

295
0:12:38.886,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Okay? My dear friend Majora Carter once told me,

296
0:12:43.273,000 --> 0:12:46,000
we have everything to gain and nothing to lose.

297
0:12:46.536,000 --> 0:12:48,000
So here, and at a time when we've gone from

298
0:12:48.788,000 --> 0:12:5,000
the audacity to hope to hope for some audacity,

299
0:12:51.343,000 --> 0:12:52,000
I urge you to do something.

300
0:12:53.238,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I urge you to do something.

301
0:12:54.709,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Right now, we're all tadpoles,

302
0:12:56.453,000 --> 0:12:59,000
but I urge you to become a big frog and take that big, green leap.

303
0:12:59.747,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I don't care if you're on the left, on the right, up the middle, wherever.

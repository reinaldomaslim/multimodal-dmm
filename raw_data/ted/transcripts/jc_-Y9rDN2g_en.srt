Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:12.797,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'd like you to come back with me for a moment

3
0:00:15.451,000 --> 0:00:17,000
to the 19th century,

4
0:00:17.475,000 --> 0:00:21,000
specifically to June 24, 1833.

5
0:00:21.923,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The British Association for the Advancement of Science

6
0:00:24.978,000 --> 0:00:27,000
is holding its third meeting at the University of Cambridge.

7
0:00:28.769,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It's the first night of the meeting,

8
0:00:30.98,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and a confrontation is about to take place

9
0:00:33.843,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that will change science forever.

10
0:00:37.451,000 --> 0:00:39,000
An elderly, white-haired man stands up.

11
0:00:40.428,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The members of the Association are shocked to realize

12
0:00:43.89,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that it's the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge,

13
0:00:46.914,000 --> 0:00:5,000
who hadn't even left his house in years until that day.

14
0:00:51.874,000 --> 0:00:53,000
They're even more shocked by what he says.

15
0:00:54.77,000 --> 0:00:59,000
"You must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers."

16
0:01:00.206,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Coleridge felt that true philosophers like himself

17
0:01:03.25,000 --> 0:01:06,000
pondered the cosmos from their armchairs.

18
0:01:06.298,000 --> 0:01:08,000
They were not mucking around in the fossil pits

19
0:01:08.754,000 --> 0:01:11,000
or conducting messy experiments with electrical piles

20
0:01:12.118,000 --> 0:01:14,000
like the members of the British Association.

21
0:01:15.09,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly.

22
0:01:19.677,000 --> 0:01:22,000
A young Cambridge scholar named William Whewell stood up

23
0:01:23.055,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and quieted the audience.

24
0:01:25.271,000 --> 0:01:27,000
He politely agreed that an appropriate name

25
0:01:28.098,000 --> 0:01:31,000
for the members of the association did not exist.

26
0:01:31.914,000 --> 0:01:36,000
"If 'philosophers' is taken to be too wide and lofty a term,"

27
0:01:37.458,000 --> 0:01:41,000
he said, "then, by analogy with 'artist,'

28
0:01:42.274,000 --> 0:01:45,000
we may form 'scientist.'"

29
0:01:46.214,000 --> 0:01:48,000
This was the first time the word scientist

30
0:01:48.843,000 --> 0:01:49,000
was uttered in public,

31
0:01:50.697,000 --> 0:01:53,000
only 179 years ago.

32
0:01:54.293,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I first found out about this confrontation when I was in graduate school,

33
0:01:57.438,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and it kind of blew me away.

34
0:01:59.482,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I mean, how could the word scientist

35
0:02:01.666,000 --> 0:02:04,000
not have existed until 1833?

36
0:02:05.155,000 --> 0:02:07,000
What were scientists called before?

37
0:02:07.346,000 --> 0:02:1,000
What had changed to make a new name necessary

38
0:02:10.671,000 --> 0:02:13,000
precisely at that moment?

39
0:02:13.801,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Prior to this meeting, those who studied the natural world

40
0:02:16.895,000 --> 0:02:18,000
were talented amateurs.

41
0:02:19.067,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Think of the country clergyman or squire

42
0:02:21.355,000 --> 0:02:23,000
collecting his beetles or fossils,

43
0:02:23.868,000 --> 0:02:25,000
like Charles Darwin, for example,

44
0:02:26.163,000 --> 0:02:3,000
or, the hired help of a nobleman, like Joseph Priestley,

45
0:02:30.339,000 --> 0:02:32,000
who was the literary companion

46
0:02:32.695,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to the Marquis of Lansdowne

47
0:02:34.855,000 --> 0:02:36,000
when he discovered oxygen.

48
0:02:37.727,000 --> 0:02:39,000
After this, they were scientists,

49
0:02:40.527,000 --> 0:02:43,000
professionals with a particular scientific method,

50
0:02:44.361,000 --> 0:02:47,000
goals, societies and funding.

51
0:02:48.096,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Much of this revolution can be traced to four men

52
0:02:51.372,000 --> 0:02:54,000
who met at Cambridge University in 1812:

53
0:02:54.631,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Charles Babbage, John Herschel, Richard Jones and William Whewell.

54
0:02:59.186,000 --> 0:03:01,000
These were brilliant, driven men

55
0:03:01.663,000 --> 0:03:04,000
who accomplished amazing things.

56
0:03:04.935,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Charles Babbage, I think known to most TEDsters,

57
0:03:07.934,000 --> 0:03:09,000
invented the first mechanical calculator

58
0:03:10.729,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and the first prototype of a modern computer.

59
0:03:14.752,000 --> 0:03:18,000
John Herschel mapped the stars of the southern hemisphere,

60
0:03:18.812,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and, in his spare time, co-invented photography.

61
0:03:23.042,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I'm sure we could all be that productive

62
0:03:25.19,000 --> 0:03:27,000
without Facebook or Twitter to take up our time.

63
0:03:28.074,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Richard Jones became an important economist

64
0:03:31.364,000 --> 0:03:33,000
who later influenced Karl Marx.

65
0:03:33.891,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And Whewell not only coined the term scientist,

66
0:03:37.413,000 --> 0:03:41,000
as well as the words anode, cathode and ion,

67
0:03:41.448,000 --> 0:03:44,000
but spearheaded international big science

68
0:03:44.484,000 --> 0:03:47,000
with his global research on the tides.

69
0:03:47.58,000 --> 0:03:5,000
In the Cambridge winter of 1812 and 1813,

70
0:03:51.292,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the four met for what they called philosophical breakfasts.

71
0:03:55.055,000 --> 0:03:56,000
They talked about science

72
0:03:56.815,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and the need for a new scientific revolution.

73
0:03:59.937,000 --> 0:04:,000
They felt science had stagnated

74
0:04:01.828,000 --> 0:04:04,000
since the days of the scientific revolution that had happened

75
0:04:05.08,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in the 17th century.

76
0:04:07.318,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It was time for a new revolution,

77
0:04:09.384,000 --> 0:04:11,000
which they pledged to bring about,

78
0:04:11.508,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and what's so amazing about these guys is,

79
0:04:14.229,000 --> 0:04:15,000
not only did they have these

80
0:04:16.012,000 --> 0:04:18,000
grandiose undergraduate dreams,

81
0:04:18.605,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but they actually carried them out,

82
0:04:20.845,000 --> 0:04:23,000
even beyond their wildest dreams.

83
0:04:23.893,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And I'm going to tell you today

84
0:04:24.985,000 --> 0:04:28,000
about four major changes to science these men made.

85
0:04:29.942,000 --> 0:04:31,000
About 200 years before,

86
0:04:32.365,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Francis Bacon and then, later, Isaac Newton,

87
0:04:35.093,000 --> 0:04:38,000
had proposed an inductive scientific method.

88
0:04:38.805,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Now that's a method that starts from

89
0:04:41.342,000 --> 0:04:43,000
observations and experiments

90
0:04:43.797,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and moves to generalizations about nature called natural laws,

91
0:04:47.269,000 --> 0:04:49,000
which are always subject to revision or rejection

92
0:04:49.753,000 --> 0:04:51,000
should new evidence arise.

93
0:04:52.298,000 --> 0:04:57,000
However, in 1809, David Ricardo muddied the waters

94
0:04:57.681,000 --> 0:04:59,000
by arguing that the science of economics

95
0:05:00.63,000 --> 0:05:03,000
should use a different, deductive method.

96
0:05:03.779,000 --> 0:05:06,000
The problem was that an influential group at Oxford

97
0:05:07.458,000 --> 0:05:11,000
began arguing that because it worked so well in economics,

98
0:05:11.539,000 --> 0:05:13,000
this deductive method ought to be applied

99
0:05:14.209,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to the natural sciences too.

100
0:05:16.883,000 --> 0:05:19,000
The members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed.

101
0:05:20.539,000 --> 0:05:23,000
They wrote books and articles promoting inductive method

102
0:05:23.821,000 --> 0:05:24,000
in all the sciences

103
0:05:25.453,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that were widely read by natural philosophers,

104
0:05:28.311,000 --> 0:05:31,000
university students and members of the public.

105
0:05:31.733,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Reading one of Herschel's books

106
0:05:33.489,000 --> 0:05:35,000
was such a watershed moment for Charles Darwin

107
0:05:36.279,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that he would later say, "Scarcely anything in my life

108
0:05:40.076,000 --> 0:05:42,000
made so deep an impression on me.

109
0:05:42.663,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It made me wish to add my might

110
0:05:45.271,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to the accumulated store of natural knowledge."

111
0:05:48.799,000 --> 0:05:51,000
It also shaped Darwin's scientific method,

112
0:05:51.911,000 --> 0:05:54,000
as well as that used by his peers.

113
0:05:55.77,000 --> 0:05:56,000
[Science for the public good]

114
0:05:57.548,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Previously, it was believed that scientific knowledge

115
0:06:00.142,000 --> 0:06:02,000
ought to be used for the good of the king or queen,

116
0:06:02.775,000 --> 0:06:04,000
or for one's own personal gain.

117
0:06:05.688,000 --> 0:06:07,000
For example, ship captains needed to know

118
0:06:08.391,000 --> 0:06:12,000
information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports.

119
0:06:12.578,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Harbormasters would gather this knowledge

120
0:06:14.771,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and sell it to the ship captains.

121
0:06:17.787,000 --> 0:06:19,000
The philosophical breakfast club changed that,

122
0:06:20.395,000 --> 0:06:21,000
working together.

123
0:06:21.745,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Whewell's worldwide study of the tides

124
0:06:23.825,000 --> 0:06:26,000
resulted in public tide tables and tidal maps

125
0:06:26.963,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that freely provided the harbormasters' knowledge

126
0:06:29.95,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to all ship captains.

127
0:06:32.051,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Herschel helped by making tidal observations

128
0:06:34.853,000 --> 0:06:35,000
off the coast of South Africa,

129
0:06:36.821,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and, as he complained to Whewell,

130
0:06:39.171,000 --> 0:06:44,000
he was knocked off the docks during a violent high tide for his trouble.

131
0:06:44.323,000 --> 0:06:46,000
The four men really helped each other in every way.

132
0:06:47.051,000 --> 0:06:5,000
They also relentlessly lobbied the British government

133
0:06:50.363,000 --> 0:06:52,000
for the money to build Babbage's engines

134
0:06:52.999,000 --> 0:06:53,000
because they believed these engines

135
0:06:54.99,000 --> 0:06:57,000
would have a huge practical impact on society.

136
0:06:58.824,000 --> 0:07:,000
In the days before pocket calculators,

137
0:07:01.444,000 --> 0:07:04,000
the numbers that most professionals needed --

138
0:07:04.78,000 --> 0:07:07,000
bankers, insurance agents, ship captains, engineers —

139
0:07:08.388,000 --> 0:07:11,000
were to be found in lookup books like this,

140
0:07:11.472,000 --> 0:07:13,000
filled with tables of figures.

141
0:07:13.868,000 --> 0:07:15,000
These tables were calculated

142
0:07:16.276,000 --> 0:07:18,000
using a fixed procedure over and over

143
0:07:19.195,000 --> 0:07:23,000
by part-time workers known as -- and this is amazing -- computers,

144
0:07:23.864,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but these calculations were really difficult.

145
0:07:26.743,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I mean, this nautical almanac

146
0:07:28.991,000 --> 0:07:31,000
published the lunar differences for every month of the year.

147
0:07:32.861,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Each month required 1,365 calculations,

148
0:07:37.527,000 --> 0:07:39,000
so these tables were filled with mistakes.

149
0:07:40.511,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Babbage's difference engine was the first mechanical calculator

150
0:07:44.676,000 --> 0:07:47,000
devised to accurately compute any of these tables.

151
0:07:48.655,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Two models of his engine were built in the last 20 years

152
0:07:52.191,000 --> 0:07:54,000
by a team from the Science Museum of London

153
0:07:54.951,000 --> 0:07:55,000
using his own plans.

154
0:07:56.634,000 --> 0:08:,000
This is the one now at the Computer History Museum in California,

155
0:08:00.772,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and it calculates accurately. It actually works.

156
0:08:04.479,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Later, Babbage's analytical engine

157
0:08:07.094,000 --> 0:08:11,000
was the first mechanical computer in the modern sense.

158
0:08:11.379,000 --> 0:08:13,000
It had a separate memory and central processor.

159
0:08:14.333,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It was capable of iteration, conditional branching

160
0:08:17.786,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and parallel processing,

161
0:08:19.258,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and it was programmable using punched cards,

162
0:08:22.23,000 --> 0:08:25,000
an idea Babbage took from Jacquard's loom.

163
0:08:25.702,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Tragically, Babbage's engines never were built in his day

164
0:08:29.938,000 --> 0:08:31,000
because most people thought that

165
0:08:32.125,000 --> 0:08:34,000
non-human computers would have no usefulness

166
0:08:35.02,000 --> 0:08:36,000
for the public.

167
0:08:36.602,000 --> 0:08:38,000
[New scientific institutions]

168
0:08:38.614,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Founded in Bacon's time, the Royal Society of London

169
0:08:42.119,000 --> 0:08:44,000
was the foremost scientific society in England

170
0:08:45.116,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and even in the rest of the world.

171
0:08:47.357,000 --> 0:08:49,000
By the 19th century, it had become

172
0:08:49.822,000 --> 0:08:5,000
a kind of gentleman's club

173
0:08:51.655,000 --> 0:08:56,000
populated mainly by antiquarians, literary men and the nobility.

174
0:08:56.662,000 --> 0:08:58,000
The members of the philosophical breakfast club

175
0:08:58.815,000 --> 0:09:01,000
helped form a number of new scientific societies,

176
0:09:01.829,000 --> 0:09:03,000
including the British Association.

177
0:09:04.229,000 --> 0:09:06,000
These new societies required

178
0:09:06.612,000 --> 0:09:09,000
that members be active researchers publishing their results.

179
0:09:10.102,000 --> 0:09:12,000
They reinstated the tradition of the Q&A

180
0:09:12.942,000 --> 0:09:14,000
after scientific papers were read,

181
0:09:15.212,000 --> 0:09:17,000
which had been discontinued by the Royal Society

182
0:09:17.532,000 --> 0:09:19,000
as being ungentlemanly.

183
0:09:20.437,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And for the first time, they gave women a foot in the door of science.

184
0:09:25.333,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Members were encouraged to bring their wives,

185
0:09:27.993,000 --> 0:09:3,000
daughters and sisters to the meetings of the British Association,

186
0:09:31.919,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and while the women were expected to attend

187
0:09:34.689,000 --> 0:09:37,000
only the public lectures and the social events like this one,

188
0:09:38.53,000 --> 0:09:42,000
they began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well.

189
0:09:42.639,000 --> 0:09:44,000
The British Association would later be the first

190
0:09:45.523,000 --> 0:09:48,000
of the major national science organizations in the world

191
0:09:49.167,000 --> 0:09:51,000
to admit women as full members.

192
0:09:51.872,000 --> 0:09:52,000
[External funding for science]

193
0:09:53.313,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Up to the 19th century,

194
0:09:54.708,000 --> 0:09:56,000
natural philosophers were expected to pay

195
0:09:57.02,000 --> 0:09:59,000
for their own equipment and supplies.

196
0:09:59.333,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Occasionally, there were prizes,

197
0:10:01.796,000 --> 0:10:04,000
such as that given to John Harrison in the 18th century,

198
0:10:05.125,000 --> 0:10:08,000
for solving the so-called longitude problem,

199
0:10:08.208,000 --> 0:10:1,000
but prizes were only given after the fact,

200
0:10:11.053,000 --> 0:10:12,000
when they were given at all.

201
0:10:12.837,000 --> 0:10:14,000
On the advice of the philosophical breakfast club,

202
0:10:15.741,000 --> 0:10:18,000
the British Association began to use the extra money

203
0:10:19.052,000 --> 0:10:21,000
generated by its meetings to give grants

204
0:10:21.726,000 --> 0:10:24,000
for research in astronomy, the tides, fossil fish,

205
0:10:24.948,000 --> 0:10:26,000
shipbuilding, and many other areas.

206
0:10:27.775,000 --> 0:10:28,000
These grants not only allowed

207
0:10:29.55,000 --> 0:10:31,000
less wealthy men to conduct research,

208
0:10:31.893,000 --> 0:10:33,000
but they also encouraged thinking outside the box,

209
0:10:34.829,000 --> 0:10:38,000
rather than just trying to solve one pre-set question.

210
0:10:38.902,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Eventually, the Royal Society

211
0:10:41.301,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit,

212
0:10:44.71,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and this has become -- fortunately it's become --

213
0:10:47.574,000 --> 0:10:51,000
a major part of the scientific landscape today.

214
0:10:52.324,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So the philosophical breakfast club

215
0:10:55.338,000 --> 0:10:58,000
helped invent the modern scientist.

216
0:10:58.485,000 --> 0:11:01,000
That's the heroic part of their story.

217
0:11:01.713,000 --> 0:11:03,000
There's a flip side as well.

218
0:11:04.652,000 --> 0:11:06,000
They did not foresee at least one consequence

219
0:11:07.636,000 --> 0:11:09,000
of their revolution.

220
0:11:10.172,000 --> 0:11:12,000
They would have been deeply dismayed

221
0:11:12.548,000 --> 0:11:16,000
by today's disjunction between science and the rest of culture.

222
0:11:17.032,000 --> 0:11:19,000
It's shocking to realize

223
0:11:19.689,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that only 28 percent of American adults

224
0:11:23.029,000 --> 0:11:26,000
have even a very basic level of science literacy,

225
0:11:26.58,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and this was tested by asking simple questions like,

226
0:11:29.651,000 --> 0:11:32,000
"Did humans and dinosaurs inhabit the Earth at the same time?"

227
0:11:33.46,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and "What proportion of the Earth is covered in water?"

228
0:11:38.222,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Once scientists became members of a professional group,

229
0:11:42.215,000 --> 0:11:45,000
they were slowly walled off from the rest of us.

230
0:11:45.58,000 --> 0:11:48,000
This is the unintended consequence of the revolution

231
0:11:49.507,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that started with our four friends.

232
0:11:52.542,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Charles Darwin said,

233
0:11:54.335,000 --> 0:11:58,000
"I sometimes think that general and popular treatises

234
0:11:58.42,000 --> 0:12:,000
are almost as important for the progress of science

235
0:12:01.189,000 --> 0:12:02,000
as original work."

236
0:12:02.776,000 --> 0:12:05,000
In fact, "Origin of Species" was written

237
0:12:05.89,000 --> 0:12:07,000
for a general and popular audience,

238
0:12:07.999,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and was widely read when it first appeared.

239
0:12:11.892,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Darwin knew what we seem to have forgotten,

240
0:12:15.903,000 --> 0:12:19,000
that science is not only for scientists.

241
0:12:20.322,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Thank you.

242
0:12:21.943,000 --> 0:12:26,000
(Applause)

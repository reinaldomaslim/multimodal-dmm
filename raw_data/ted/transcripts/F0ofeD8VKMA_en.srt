1
0:00:12.126,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Chris Anderson: OK, Stewart,

2
0:00:14.421,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in the '60s, you -- I think it was '68 -- you founded this magazine.

3
0:00:19.887,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Stewart Brand: Bravo! It's the original one.

4
0:00:21.983,000 --> 0:00:22,000
That's hard to find.

5
0:00:23.176,000 --> 0:00:24,000
CA: Right. Issue One, right?

6
0:00:24.564,000 --> 0:00:25,000
SB: Mm hmm.

7
0:00:25.74,000 --> 0:00:27,000
CA: Why did that make so much impact?

8
0:00:29.381,000 --> 0:00:32,000
SB: Counterculture was the main event that I was part of at the time,

9
0:00:33.869,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and it was made up of hippies and New Left.

10
0:00:37.797,000 --> 0:00:38,000
That was sort of my contemporaries,

11
0:00:39.725,000 --> 0:00:41,000
the people I was just slightly older than.

12
0:00:42.381,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And my mode is to look at where the interesting flow is

13
0:00:47.606,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and then look in the other direction.

14
0:00:49.595,000 --> 0:00:5,000
CA: (Laughs)

15
0:00:51.009,000 --> 0:00:53,000
SB: Partly, I was trained to do that as an army officer,

16
0:00:53.677,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but partly, it's just a cheap heuristic to find originalities:

17
0:00:56.734,000 --> 0:00:58,000
don't look where everybody else is looking,

18
0:00:59.227,000 --> 0:01:,000
look the opposite way.

19
0:01:00.516,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So the deal with counterculture is, the hippies were very romantic

20
0:01:04.381,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and kind of against technology,

21
0:01:06.252,000 --> 0:01:08,000
except very good LSD from Sandoz,

22
0:01:09.31,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and the New Left was against technology

23
0:01:12.966,000 --> 0:01:14,000
because they thought it was a power device.

24
0:01:15.654,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Computers were: do not spindle, fold, or mutilate.

25
0:01:19.016,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Fight that.

26
0:01:20.684,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And so, the Whole Earth Catalog was kind of a counter-counterculture thing

27
0:01:25.934,000 --> 0:01:28,000
in the sense that I bought Buckminster Fuller's idea

28
0:01:30.639,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that tools of are of the essence.

29
0:01:33.053,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Science and engineers basically define the world in interesting ways.

30
0:01:38.35,000 --> 0:01:4,000
If all the politicians disappeared one week,

31
0:01:41.212,000 --> 0:01:42,000
it would be ... a nuisance.

32
0:01:43.582,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But if all the scientists and engineers disappeared one week,

33
0:01:46.9,000 --> 0:01:47,000
it would be way more than a nuisance.

34
0:01:48.755,000 --> 0:01:5,000
CA: We still believe that, I think.

35
0:01:51.057,000 --> 0:01:53,000
SB: So focus on that.

36
0:01:54.1,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And then the New Left was talking about power to the people.

37
0:01:59.244,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And people like Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak

38
0:02:02.847,000 --> 0:02:04,000
cut that and just said, power to people,

39
0:02:06.36,000 --> 0:02:07,000
tools that actually work.

40
0:02:08.54,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And so, where Fuller was saying don't try to change human nature,

41
0:02:13.389,000 --> 0:02:17,000
people have been trying for a long time and it does not even bend,

42
0:02:17.551,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but you can change tools very easily.

43
0:02:19.375,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So the efficient thing to do if you want to make the world better

44
0:02:22.48,000 --> 0:02:25,000
is not try to make people behave differently like the New Left was,

45
0:02:25.966,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but just give them tools that go in the right direction.

46
0:02:28.924,000 --> 0:02:29,000
That was the Whole Earth Catalog.

47
0:02:30.778,000 --> 0:02:33,000
CA: And Stewart, the central image -- this is one of the first images,

48
0:02:34.175,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the first time people had seen Earth from outer space.

49
0:02:36.805,000 --> 0:02:37,000
That had an impact, too.

50
0:02:38.469,000 --> 0:02:41,000
SB: It was kind of a chance that in the spring of '66,

51
0:02:42.347,000 --> 0:02:44,000
thanks to an LSD experience on a rooftop in San Francisco,

52
0:02:45.268,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I got thinking about, again, something that Fuller talked about,

53
0:02:48.37,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that a lot of people assume that the Earth is flat

54
0:02:50.773,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and kind of infinite in terms of its resources,

55
0:02:53.036,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but once you really grasp that it's a sphere

56
0:02:55.3,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and that there's only so much of it,

57
0:02:57.56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
then you start husbanding your resources

58
0:03:00.027,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and thinking about it as a finite system.

59
0:03:02.041,000 --> 0:03:04,000
"Spaceship Earth" was his metaphor.

60
0:03:04.235,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And I wanted that to be the case,

61
0:03:07.199,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but on LSD I was getting higher and higher on my hundred micrograms

62
0:03:11.872,000 --> 0:03:13,000
on the roof of San Francisco,

63
0:03:14.961,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and noticed that the downtown buildings which were right in front of me

64
0:03:19.473,000 --> 0:03:22,000
were not all parallel, they were sort of fanned out like this.

65
0:03:22.733,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And that's because they are on a curved surface.

66
0:03:26.239,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And if I were even higher, I would see that even more clearly,

67
0:03:29.229,000 --> 0:03:3,000
higher than that, more clearly still,

68
0:03:31.035,000 --> 0:03:32,000
higher enough, and it would close,

69
0:03:32.709,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and you would get the circle of Earth from space.

70
0:03:35.067,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And I thought, you know, we've been in space for 10 years --

71
0:03:38.008,000 --> 0:03:4,000
at that time, this is '66 --

72
0:03:40.046,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and the cameras had never looked back.

73
0:03:42.01,000 --> 0:03:45,000
They'd always been looking out or looking at just parts of the Earth.

74
0:03:45.536,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And so I said, why haven't we seen a photograph of the whole Earth yet?

75
0:03:50.033,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And it went around and NASA got it and senators, secretaries got it,

76
0:03:53.521,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and various people in the Politburo got it,

77
0:03:55.663,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and it went around and around.

78
0:03:57.176,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And within two and a half years,

79
0:03:58.79,000 --> 0:04:,000
about the time the Whole Earth Catalog came out,

80
0:04:01.091,000 --> 0:04:02,000
these images started to appear,

81
0:04:02.672,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and indeed, they did transform everything.

82
0:04:04.837,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And my idea of hacking civilization

83
0:04:09.514,000 --> 0:04:13,000
is that you try to do something lazy and ingenious

84
0:04:13.742,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and just sort of trick the situation.

85
0:04:16.468,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So all of these photographs that you see --

86
0:04:18.506,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and then the march for science last week,

87
0:04:20.612,000 --> 0:04:22,000
they were carrying these Whole Earth banners and so on --

88
0:04:23.47,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I did that with no work.

89
0:04:26.188,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I sold those buttons for 25 cents apiece.

90
0:04:28.464,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So, you know, tweaking the system

91
0:04:32.945,000 --> 0:04:35,000
is, I think, not only the most efficient way to make the system go

92
0:04:36.168,000 --> 0:04:37,000
in interesting ways,

93
0:04:37.359,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but in some ways, the safest way,

94
0:04:39.051,000 --> 0:04:42,000
because when you try to horse the whole system around in a big way,

95
0:04:42.55,000 --> 0:04:44,000
you can get into big horsing-around problems,

96
0:04:45.527,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but if you tweak it, it will adjust to the tweak.

97
0:04:48.379,000 --> 0:04:5,000
CA: So since then, among many other things,

98
0:04:50.509,000 --> 0:04:53,000
you've been regarded as a leading voice in the environmental movement,

99
0:04:53.86,000 --> 0:04:54,000
but you are also a counterculturalist,

100
0:04:55.82,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and recently, you've been taking on a lot of,

101
0:04:59.27,000 --> 0:05:,000
well, you've been declaring

102
0:05:00.64,000 --> 0:05:02,000
what a lot of environmentalists almost believe are heresies.

103
0:05:03.516,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I kind of want to explore a couple of those.

104
0:05:05.666,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I mean, tell me about this image here.

105
0:05:08.6,000 --> 0:05:09,000
SB: Ha-ha!

106
0:05:10.02,000 --> 0:05:12,000
That's a National Geographic image

107
0:05:12.967,000 --> 0:05:15,000
of what is called the mammoth steppe,

108
0:05:16.635,000 --> 0:05:19,000
what the far north, the sub-Arctic and Arctic region, used to look like.

109
0:05:20.824,000 --> 0:05:22,000
In fact, the whole world used to look like that.

110
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
What we find in South Africa and the Serengeti now,

111
0:05:27.62,000 --> 0:05:28,000
lots of big animals,

112
0:05:29.278,000 --> 0:05:32,000
was the case in this part of Canada,

113
0:05:32.674,000 --> 0:05:34,000
throughout the US, throughout Eurasia, throughout the world.

114
0:05:35.638,000 --> 0:05:36,000
This was the norm

115
0:05:37.35,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and can be again.

116
0:05:40.47,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So in a sense,

117
0:05:42.335,000 --> 0:05:47,000
my long-term goal at this point is to not only bring back those animals

118
0:05:47.993,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and the grassland they made,

119
0:05:50.103,000 --> 0:05:55,000
which could be a climate stabilization system over the long run,

120
0:05:55.503,000 --> 0:05:57,000
but even the mammoths there in the background

121
0:05:57.827,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that are part of the story.

122
0:05:59.598,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And I think that's probably a 200-year goal.

123
0:06:04.183,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Maybe in 100, by the end of this century,

124
0:06:06.736,000 --> 0:06:08,000
we should be able to dial down the extinction rate

125
0:06:09.122,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to sort of what it's been in the background.

126
0:06:11.212,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Bringing back this amount of bio-abundance will take longer,

127
0:06:14.073,000 --> 0:06:15,000
but it's worth doing.

128
0:06:15.254,000 --> 0:06:16,000
CA: We'll come back to the mammoths,

129
0:06:17.021,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but explain how we should think of extinctions.

130
0:06:20.789,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Obviously, one of the huge concerns right now

131
0:06:24.082,000 --> 0:06:28,000
is that extinction is happening at a faster rate than ever in history.

132
0:06:28.952,000 --> 0:06:3,000
That's the meme that's out there.

133
0:06:31.381,000 --> 0:06:32,000
How should we think of it?

134
0:06:33.145,000 --> 0:06:34,000
SB: The story that's out there

135
0:06:34.705,000 --> 0:06:36,000
is that we're in the middle of the Sixth Extinction

136
0:06:37.391,000 --> 0:06:39,000
or maybe in the beginning of the Sixth Extinction.

137
0:06:39.915,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Because we're in the de-extinction business,

138
0:06:42.166,000 --> 0:06:45,000
the preventing-extinction business with Revive & Restore,

139
0:06:45.255,000 --> 0:06:48,000
we started looking at what's actually going on with extinction.

140
0:06:48.346,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And it turns out, there's a very confused set of data out there

141
0:06:52.702,000 --> 0:06:54,000
which gets oversimplified

142
0:06:55.119,000 --> 0:06:58,000
into the narrative of we're becoming ...

143
0:06:58.195,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Here are five mass extinctions that are indicated by the yellow triangles,

144
0:07:03.873,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and we're now next.

145
0:07:06.86,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The last one there on the far right

146
0:07:08.737,000 --> 0:07:11,000
was the meteor that struck 66 million years ago

147
0:07:11.912,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and did in the dinosaurs.

148
0:07:14.139,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And the story is, we're the next meteor.

149
0:07:17.494,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Well, here's the deal.

150
0:07:18.697,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I wound up researching this for a paper I wrote,

151
0:07:21.636,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that a mass extinction is when 75 percent of all the species

152
0:07:27.537,000 --> 0:07:28,000
in the world go extinct.

153
0:07:31.163,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Well, there's on the order of five-and-a-half-million species,

154
0:07:34.344,000 --> 0:07:36,000
of which we've identified one and a half million.

155
0:07:36.876,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Another 14,000 are being identified every year.

156
0:07:39.836,000 --> 0:07:41,000
There's a lot of biology going on out there.

157
0:07:42.584,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Since 1500,

158
0:07:45.587,000 --> 0:07:47,000
about 500 species have gone extinct,

159
0:07:49.077,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and you'll see the term "mass extinction" kind of used in strange ways.

160
0:07:53.079,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So there was, about a year and a half ago,

161
0:07:55.834,000 --> 0:07:58,000
a front-page story by Carl Zimmer in the New York Times,

162
0:07:58.907,000 --> 0:08:01,000
"Mass Extinction in the Oceans, Broad Studies Show."

163
0:08:02.62,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And then you read into the article, and it mentions that since 1500,

164
0:08:06.307,000 --> 0:08:1,000
15 species -- one, five -- have gone extinct in the oceans,

165
0:08:11.29,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and, oh, by the way, none in the last 50 years.

166
0:08:14.05,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And you read further into the story, and it's saying,

167
0:08:16.623,000 --> 0:08:17,000
the horrifying thing that's going on

168
0:08:18.408,000 --> 0:08:21,000
is that the fisheries are so overfishing the wild fishes,

169
0:08:22.288,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that it is taking down the fish populations in the oceans

170
0:08:25.85,000 --> 0:08:26,000
by 38 percent.

171
0:08:27.591,000 --> 0:08:28,000
That's the serious thing.

172
0:08:29.578,000 --> 0:08:31,000
None of those species are probably going to go extinct.

173
0:08:32.422,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So you've just put, that headline writer

174
0:08:36.395,000 --> 0:08:38,000
put a panic button

175
0:08:38.64,000 --> 0:08:39,000
on the top of the story.

176
0:08:40.161,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It's clickbait kind of stuff,

177
0:08:41.956,000 --> 0:08:44,000
but it's basically saying, "Oh my God, start panicking,

178
0:08:45.07,000 --> 0:08:47,000
we're going to lose all the species in the oceans."

179
0:08:47.588,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Nothing like that is in prospect.

180
0:08:50.842,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And in fact, what I then started looking into in a little more detail,

181
0:08:55.379,000 --> 0:08:59,000
the Red List shows about 23,000 species that are considered threatened

182
0:08:59.507,000 --> 0:09:,000
at one level or another,

183
0:09:00.861,000 --> 0:09:03,000
coming from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the IUCN.

184
0:09:04.769,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And Nature Magazine had a piece surveying the loss of wildlife,

185
0:09:09.814,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and it said,

186
0:09:11.006,000 --> 0:09:14,000
"If all of those 23,000 went extinct

187
0:09:14.171,000 --> 0:09:15,000
in the next century or so,

188
0:09:16.134,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and that rate of extinction carried on for more centuries and millennia,

189
0:09:21.043,000 --> 0:09:25,000
then we might be at the beginning of a sixth extinction.

190
0:09:25.945,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So the exaggeration is way out of hand.

191
0:09:27.973,000 --> 0:09:28,000
But environmentalists always exaggerate.

192
0:09:29.914,000 --> 0:09:3,000
That's a problem.

193
0:09:31.107,000 --> 0:09:34,000
CA: I mean, they probably feel a moral responsibility to,

194
0:09:34.287,000 --> 0:09:37,000
because they care so much about the thing that they are looking at,

195
0:09:37.512,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and unless you bang the drum for it, maybe no one listens.

196
0:09:40.471,000 --> 0:09:43,000
SB: Every time somebody says moral this or moral that --

197
0:09:43.592,000 --> 0:09:45,000
"moral hazard," "precautionary principle" --

198
0:09:46.555,000 --> 0:09:5,000
these are terms that are used to basically say no to things.

199
0:09:51.486,000 --> 0:09:54,000
CA: So the problem isn't so much fish extinction, animal extinction,

200
0:09:55.216,000 --> 0:09:57,000
it's fish flourishing, animal flourishing,

201
0:09:58.031,000 --> 0:10:,000
that we're crowding them to some extent?

202
0:10:00.557,000 --> 0:10:04,000
SB: Yeah, and I think we are crowding, and there is losses going on.

203
0:10:04.84,000 --> 0:10:07,000
The major losses are caused by agriculture,

204
0:10:07.908,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and so anything that improves agriculture and basically makes it more condensed,

205
0:10:13.549,000 --> 0:10:14,000
more highly productive,

206
0:10:15.275,000 --> 0:10:16,000
including GMOs, please,

207
0:10:17.278,000 --> 0:10:19,000
but even if you want to do vertical farms in town,

208
0:10:19.838,000 --> 0:10:2,000
including inside farms,

209
0:10:21.125,000 --> 0:10:24,000
all the things that have been learned about how to grow pot in basements,

210
0:10:24.78,000 --> 0:10:27,000
is now being applied to growing vegetables inside containers --

211
0:10:27.985,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that's great, that's all good stuff,

212
0:10:29.877,000 --> 0:10:33,000
because land sparing is the main thing we can do for nature.

213
0:10:34.27,000 --> 0:10:35,000
People moving to cities is good.

214
0:10:36.424,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Making agriculture less of a destruction of the landscape is good.

215
0:10:41.21,000 --> 0:10:44,000
CA: There people talking about bringing back species, rewilding ...

216
0:10:44.439,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Well, first of all, rewilding species: What's the story with these guys?

217
0:10:47.989,000 --> 0:10:48,000
SB: Ha-ha! Wolves.

218
0:10:50.433,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Europe, connecting to the previous point,

219
0:10:53.642,000 --> 0:10:55,000
we're now at probably peak farmland,

220
0:10:56.025,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and, by the way, in terms of population,

221
0:10:57.989,000 --> 0:10:59,000
we are already at peak children being alive.

222
0:11:00.589,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Henceforth, there will be fewer and fewer children.

223
0:11:03.098,000 --> 0:11:06,000
We are in the last doubling of human population,

224
0:11:06.733,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and it will get to nine, maybe nine and a half billion,

225
0:11:10.861,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and then start not just leveling off, but probably going down.

226
0:11:14.708,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Likewise, farmland has now peaked,

227
0:11:17.655,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and one of the ways that plays out in Europe

228
0:11:21.199,000 --> 0:11:24,000
is there's a lot of abandoned farmland now,

229
0:11:24.275,000 --> 0:11:25,000
which immediately reforests.

230
0:11:26.052,000 --> 0:11:28,000
They don't do wildlife corridors in Europe.

231
0:11:28.923,000 --> 0:11:31,000
They don't need to, because so many of these farms are connected

232
0:11:32.045,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that they've made reforested wildlife corridors,

233
0:11:35.056,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that the wolves are coming back, in this case, to Spain.

234
0:11:38.175,000 --> 0:11:4,000
They've gotten all the way to the Netherlands.

235
0:11:40.741,000 --> 0:11:43,000
There's bears coming back. There's lynx coming back.

236
0:11:44.321,000 --> 0:11:47,000
There's the European jackal. I had no idea such a thing existed.

237
0:11:47.526,000 --> 0:11:49,000
They're coming back from Italy to the rest of Europe.

238
0:11:50.117,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And unlike here, these are all predators, which is kind of interesting.

239
0:11:53.632,000 --> 0:11:56,000
They are being welcomed by Europeans. They've been missed.

240
0:11:57.071,000 --> 0:11:59,000
CA: And counterintuitively, when you bring back the predators,

241
0:12:00.092,000 --> 0:12:02,000
it actually increases rather than reduces

242
0:12:02.228,000 --> 0:12:04,000
the diversity of the underlying ecosystem often.

243
0:12:04.515,000 --> 0:12:07,000
SB: Yeah, generally predators and large animals --

244
0:12:08.295,000 --> 0:12:11,000
large animals and large animals with sharp teeth and claws --

245
0:12:11.561,000 --> 0:12:16,000
are turning out to be highly important for a really rich ecosystem.

246
0:12:16.691,000 --> 0:12:19,000
CA: Which maybe brings us to this rather more dramatic rewilding project

247
0:12:20.663,000 --> 0:12:21,000
that you've got yourself involved in.

248
0:12:22.576,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Why would someone want to bring back these terrifying woolly mammoths?

249
0:12:25.996,000 --> 0:12:27,000
SB: Hmm. Asian elephants are the closest relative

250
0:12:28.894,000 --> 0:12:3,000
to the woolly mammoth,

251
0:12:31.211,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and they're about the same size, genetically very close.

252
0:12:34.124,000 --> 0:12:38,000
They diverged quite recently in evolutionary history.

253
0:12:38.201,000 --> 0:12:4,000
The Asian elephants are closer to woolly mammoths

254
0:12:40.608,000 --> 0:12:41,000
than they are to African elephants,

255
0:12:42.427,000 --> 0:12:44,000
but they're close enough to African elephants

256
0:12:44.658,000 --> 0:12:46,000
that they have successfully hybridized.

257
0:12:47.486,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So we're working with George Church at Harvard,

258
0:12:51.168,000 --> 0:12:55,000
who has already moved the genes for four major traits

259
0:12:55.261,000 --> 0:13:01,000
from the now well-preserved, well-studied genome of the woolly mammoth,

260
0:13:01.357,000 --> 0:13:03,000
thanks to so-called "ancient DNA analysis."

261
0:13:05.178,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And in the lab, he has moved those genes into living Asian elephant cell lines,

262
0:13:10.985,000 --> 0:13:13,000
where they're taking up their proper place thanks to CRISPR.

263
0:13:14.3,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I mean, they're not shooting the genes in like you did with genetic engineering.

264
0:13:18.159,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Now with CRISPR you're editing, basically, one allele,

265
0:13:21.472,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and replacing it in the place of another allele.

266
0:13:25.352,000 --> 0:13:31,000
So you're now getting basically Asian elephant germline cells

267
0:13:31.679,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that are effectively in terms of the traits that you're going for

268
0:13:35.553,000 --> 0:13:37,000
to be comfortable in the Arctic,

269
0:13:38.899,000 --> 0:13:39,000
you're getting them in there.

270
0:13:40.37,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So we go through the process

271
0:13:41.994,000 --> 0:13:43,000
of getting that through a surrogate mother,

272
0:13:44.702,000 --> 0:13:45,000
an Asian elephant mother.

273
0:13:46.269,000 --> 0:13:5,000
You can get a proxy, as it's being called by conservation biologists,

274
0:13:50.991,000 --> 0:13:51,000
of the woolly mammoth,

275
0:13:52.416,000 --> 0:13:57,000
that is effectively a hairy, curly-trunked, Asian elephant

276
0:13:57.627,000 --> 0:13:59,000
that is perfectly comfortable in the sub-Arctic.

277
0:14:00.596,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Now, it's the case, so many people say,

278
0:14:02.711,000 --> 0:14:04,000
"Well, how are you going to get them there?

279
0:14:04.743,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And Asian elephants, they don't like snow, right?"

280
0:14:07.134,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Well, it turns out, they do like snow.

281
0:14:09.042,000 --> 0:14:1,000
There's some in an Ontario zoo

282
0:14:10.606,000 --> 0:14:12,000
that have made snowballs bigger than people.

283
0:14:12.913,000 --> 0:14:15,000
They just love -- you know, with a trunk, you can start a little thing,

284
0:14:16.407,000 --> 0:14:17,000
roll it and make it bigger.

285
0:14:18.749,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And then people say,

286
0:14:20.048,000 --> 0:14:23,000
"Yeah, but it's 22 months of gestation.

287
0:14:25.733,000 --> 0:14:29,000
This kind of cross-species cloning is tricky business, anyway.

288
0:14:30.298,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Are you going to lose some of the surrogate Asian elephant mothers?"

289
0:14:33.587,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And then George Church says, "That's all right.

290
0:14:35.814,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We'll do an artificial uterus and grow them that way."

291
0:14:38.406,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Then people say, "Yeah, next century, maybe,"

292
0:14:40.7,000 --> 0:14:42,000
except the news came out this week in Nature

293
0:14:42.978,000 --> 0:14:46,000
that there's now an artificial uterus in which they've grown a lamb

294
0:14:47.325,000 --> 0:14:48,000
to four weeks.

295
0:14:48.786,000 --> 0:14:5,000
That's halfway through its gestation period.

296
0:14:52.067,000 --> 0:14:54,000
So this stuff is moving right along.

297
0:14:54.363,000 --> 0:14:56,000
CA: But why should we want a world where --

298
0:14:57.136,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Picture a world where there are thousands of these things

299
0:14:59.879,000 --> 0:15:,000
thundering across Siberia.

300
0:15:01.86,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Is that a better world?

301
0:15:03.158,000 --> 0:15:04,000
SB: Potentially. It's --

302
0:15:04.983,000 --> 0:15:05,000
(Laughter)

303
0:15:06.626,000 --> 0:15:1,000
There's three groups, basically, working on the woolly mammoth seriously:

304
0:15:11.645,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Revive & Restore, we're kind of in the middle;

305
0:15:13.955,000 --> 0:15:16,000
George Church and the group at Harvard that are doing the genetics in the lab;

306
0:15:17.67,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and then there's an amazing old scientist named Zimov

307
0:15:23.851,000 --> 0:15:27,000
who works in northern Siberia,

308
0:15:28.115,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and his son Nikita, who has bought into the system,

309
0:15:31.263,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and they are, Sergey and Nikita Zimov have been, for 25 years,

310
0:15:37.597,000 --> 0:15:39,000
creating what they call "Pleistocene Park,"

311
0:15:40.028,000 --> 0:15:44,000
which is a place in a really tough part of Siberia that is pure tundra.

312
0:15:45.858,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And the research that's been done shows

313
0:15:48.25,000 --> 0:15:53,000
that there's probably one one-hundredth of the animals on the landscape there

314
0:15:53.603,000 --> 0:15:54,000
that there used to be.

315
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Like that earlier image, we saw lots of animals.

316
0:15:57.48,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Now there's almost none.

317
0:15:59.199,000 --> 0:16:02,000
The tundra is mostly moss, and then there's the boreal forest.

318
0:16:02.772,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And that's the way it is, folks. There's just a few animals there.

319
0:16:05.924,000 --> 0:16:07,000
So they brought in a lot of grazing animals:

320
0:16:08.094,000 --> 0:16:11,000
musk ox, Yakutian horses, they're bringing in some bison,

321
0:16:11.223,000 --> 0:16:12,000
they're bringing in some more now,

322
0:16:13.035,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and put them in at the density that they used to be.

323
0:16:16.235,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And grasslands are made by grazers.

324
0:16:19.251,000 --> 0:16:22,000
So these animals are there, grazing away,

325
0:16:22.866,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and they're doing a couple of things.

326
0:16:24.746,000 --> 0:16:27,000
First of all, they're turning the tundra, the moss, back into grassland.

327
0:16:28.442,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Grassland fixes carbon.

328
0:16:30.287,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Tundra, in a warming world, is thawing and releasing a lot of carbon dioxide

329
0:16:35.121,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and also methane.

330
0:16:36.844,000 --> 0:16:38,000
So already in their little 25 square miles,

331
0:16:39.765,000 --> 0:16:41,000
they're doing a climate stabilization thing.

332
0:16:42.596,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Part of that story, though,

333
0:16:44.632,000 --> 0:16:48,000
is that the boreal forest is very absorbent to sunlight,

334
0:16:49.525,000 --> 0:16:51,000
even in the winter when snow is on the ground.

335
0:16:52.144,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And the way the mammoth steppe,

336
0:16:53.824,000 --> 0:16:55,000
which used to wrap all the way around the North Pole --

337
0:16:56.471,000 --> 0:16:58,000
there's a lot of landmass around the North Pole --

338
0:16:58.883,000 --> 0:17:,000
that was all this grassland.

339
0:17:01.658,000 --> 0:17:03,000
And the steppe was magnificent,

340
0:17:04.303,000 --> 0:17:08,000
probably one of the most productive biomes in the world,

341
0:17:08.633,000 --> 0:17:09,000
the biggest biome in the world.

342
0:17:11.052,000 --> 0:17:15,000
The forest part of it, right now, Sergey Zimov and Nikita

343
0:17:15.234,000 --> 0:17:18,000
go out with this old military tank they got for nothing,

344
0:17:18.5,000 --> 0:17:19,000
and they knock down the trees.

345
0:17:20.272,000 --> 0:17:23,000
And that's a bore, and it's tiresome,

346
0:17:23.298,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and as Sergey says, "... and they make no dung!"

347
0:17:26.145,000 --> 0:17:29,000
which, by the way, these big animals do, including mammoths.

348
0:17:29.878,000 --> 0:17:31,000
So mammoths become what conservation biologists call

349
0:17:32.824,000 --> 0:17:33,000
an umbrella species.

350
0:17:34.311,000 --> 0:17:37,000
It's an exciting animal -- pandas in China or wherever --

351
0:17:37.997,000 --> 0:17:41,000
that the excitement that goes on of making life good for that animal

352
0:17:42.348,000 --> 0:17:44,000
is making a habitat, an ecosystem,

353
0:17:44.584,000 --> 0:17:46,000
which is good for a whole lot of creatures and plants,

354
0:17:47.429,000 --> 0:17:5,000
and it ideally gets to the point of being self-managing,

355
0:17:50.747,000 --> 0:17:52,000
where the conservation biologists can back off and say,

356
0:17:53.358,000 --> 0:17:55,000
"All we have to do is keep out the destructive invasives,

357
0:17:56.357,000 --> 0:17:57,000
and this thing can just cook."

358
0:17:58.585,000 --> 0:18:01,000
CA: So there's many other species that you're dreaming of de-extincting

359
0:18:02.41,000 --> 0:18:03,000
at some point,

360
0:18:03.668,000 --> 0:18:06,000
but I think what I'd actually like to move on to

361
0:18:06.708,000 --> 0:18:09,000
is this idea you talked about how mammoths might help

362
0:18:10.156,000 --> 0:18:12,000
green Siberia in a sense,

363
0:18:12.586,000 --> 0:18:17,000
or at least, I'm not talking about tropical rainforest,

364
0:18:18.519,000 --> 0:18:21,000
but this question of greening the planet you've thought about a lot.

365
0:18:22.424,000 --> 0:18:24,000
And the traditional story is

366
0:18:24.616,000 --> 0:18:3,000
that deforestation is one of the most awful curses

367
0:18:30.898,000 --> 0:18:31,000
of modern times,

368
0:18:32.495,000 --> 0:18:35,000
and that it's a huge contributor to climate change.

369
0:18:36.374,000 --> 0:18:39,000
And then you went and sent me this graph here, or this map.

370
0:18:39.88,000 --> 0:18:4,000
What is this map?

371
0:18:41.266,000 --> 0:18:42,000
SB: Global greening.

372
0:18:43.284,000 --> 0:18:47,000
The thing to do with any narrative that you get from headlines

373
0:18:47.723,000 --> 0:18:48,000
and from short news stories

374
0:18:49.626,000 --> 0:18:5,000
is to look for what else is going on,

375
0:18:52.327,000 --> 0:18:56,000
and look for what Marc Andreessen calls "narrative violation."

376
0:18:57.416,000 --> 0:19:02,000
So the narrative -- and Al Gore is master of putting it out there --

377
0:19:02.679,000 --> 0:19:06,000
is that there's this civilization-threatening

378
0:19:06.79,000 --> 0:19:08,000
climate change coming on very rapidly.

379
0:19:08.936,000 --> 0:19:14,000
We have to cease all extra production of greenhouse gases, especially CO2,

380
0:19:15.022,000 --> 0:19:16,000
as soon as possible,

381
0:19:16.202,000 --> 0:19:18,000
otherwise, we're in deep, deep trouble.

382
0:19:18.765,000 --> 0:19:2,000
All of that is true, but it's not the whole story,

383
0:19:21.207,000 --> 0:19:24,000
and the whole story is more interesting than these fragmentary stories.

384
0:19:25.548,000 --> 0:19:27,000
Plants love CO2.

385
0:19:28.33,000 --> 0:19:31,000
What plants are made of is CO2 plus water via sunshine.

386
0:19:32.985,000 --> 0:19:36,000
And so in many greenhouses, industrialized greenhouses,

387
0:19:37.854,000 --> 0:19:4,000
they add CO2 because the plants turn that into plant matter.

388
0:19:41.144,000 --> 0:19:44,000
So the studies have been done with satellites and other things,

389
0:19:44.198,000 --> 0:19:48,000
and what you're seeing here is a graph of, over the last 33 years or so,

390
0:19:48.294,000 --> 0:19:54,000
there's 14 percent more leaf action going on.

391
0:19:54.482,000 --> 0:19:55,000
There's that much more biomass.

392
0:19:56.11,000 --> 0:19:59,000
There's that much more what ecologists call "primary production."

393
0:19:59.276,000 --> 0:20:,000
There's that much more life happening,

394
0:20:01.245,000 --> 0:20:02,000
thanks to climate change,

395
0:20:02.565,000 --> 0:20:04,000
thanks to all of our goddam coal plants.

396
0:20:05.441,000 --> 0:20:07,000
So -- whoa, what's going on here?

397
0:20:08.235,000 --> 0:20:11,000
By the way, crop production goes up with this.

398
0:20:11.874,000 --> 0:20:15,000
This is a partial counter

399
0:20:16.176,000 --> 0:20:19,000
to the increase of CO2,

400
0:20:19.46,000 --> 0:20:22,000
because there's that much more plant that is sucking it down

401
0:20:22.845,000 --> 0:20:23,000
into plant matter.

402
0:20:24.204,000 --> 0:20:26,000
Some of that then decays and goes right back up,

403
0:20:26.526,000 --> 0:20:27,000
but some of it is going down into roots

404
0:20:28.492,000 --> 0:20:3,000
and going into the soil and staying there.

405
0:20:30.562,000 --> 0:20:33,000
So these counter things are part of what you need to bear in mind,

406
0:20:34.449,000 --> 0:20:35,000
and the deeper story is

407
0:20:36.19,000 --> 0:20:4,000
that thinking about and dealing with and engineering climate

408
0:20:41.071,000 --> 0:20:43,000
is a pretty complex process.

409
0:20:43.857,000 --> 0:20:44,000
It's like medicine.

410
0:20:45.587,000 --> 0:20:48,000
You're always, again, tweaking around with the system

411
0:20:48.831,000 --> 0:20:49,000
to see what makes an improvement.

412
0:20:50.831,000 --> 0:20:52,000
Then you do more of that, see it's still getting better,

413
0:20:53.543,000 --> 0:20:55,000
then -- oop! -- that's enough, back off half a turn.

414
0:20:56.024,000 --> 0:20:59,000
CA: But might some people say, "Not all green is created equal."

415
0:20:59.056,000 --> 0:21:02,000
Possibly what we're doing is trading off the magnificence of the rainforest

416
0:21:02.613,000 --> 0:21:03,000
and all that diversity

417
0:21:03.789,000 --> 0:21:06,000
for, I don't know, green pond scum or grass or something like that.

418
0:21:07.013,000 --> 0:21:1,000
SB: In this particular study, it turns out every form of plant is increasing.

419
0:21:10.685,000 --> 0:21:12,000
Now, what's interestingly left out of this study

420
0:21:12.963,000 --> 0:21:14,000
is what the hell is going on in the oceans.

421
0:21:15.013,000 --> 0:21:16,000
Primary production in the oceans,

422
0:21:16.855,000 --> 0:21:19,000
the biota of the oceans, mostly microbial,

423
0:21:20.011,000 --> 0:21:22,000
what they're up to is probably the most important thing.

424
0:21:22.719,000 --> 0:21:24,000
They're the ones that create the atmosphere

425
0:21:24.791,000 --> 0:21:25,000
that we're happily breathing,

426
0:21:26.622,000 --> 0:21:27,000
and they're not part of this study.

427
0:21:29.051,000 --> 0:21:31,000
This is one of the things James Lovelock has been insisting;

428
0:21:31.981,000 --> 0:21:34,000
basically, our knowledge of the oceans, especially of ocean life,

429
0:21:35.436,000 --> 0:21:37,000
is fundamentally vapor, in this sense.

430
0:21:37.587,000 --> 0:21:39,000
So we're in the process of finding out

431
0:21:39.651,000 --> 0:21:44,000
by inadvertent bad geoengineering of too much CO2 in the atmosphere,

432
0:21:44.914,000 --> 0:21:46,000
finding out, what is the ocean doing with that?

433
0:21:47.269,000 --> 0:21:48,000
Well, the ocean, with the extra heat,

434
0:21:49.191,000 --> 0:21:5,000
is swelling up.

435
0:21:50.516,000 --> 0:21:52,000
That's most of where we're getting the sea level rise,

436
0:21:53.078,000 --> 0:21:55,000
and there's a lot more coming with more global warming.

437
0:21:55.734,000 --> 0:21:59,000
We're getting terrible harm to some of the coral reefs,

438
0:22:00.176,000 --> 0:22:01,000
like off of Australia.

439
0:22:02.509,000 --> 0:22:06,000
The great reef there is just a lot of bleaching from overheating.

440
0:22:06.842,000 --> 0:22:12,000
And this is why I and Danny Hillis, in our previous session on the main stage,

441
0:22:13.321,000 --> 0:22:17,000
was saying, "Look, geoengineering is worth experimenting with enough

442
0:22:17.711,000 --> 0:22:18,000
to see that it works,

443
0:22:19.221,000 --> 0:22:23,000
to see if we can buy time in the warming aspect of all of this,

444
0:22:24.264,000 --> 0:22:28,000
tweak the system with small but usable research,

445
0:22:29.055,000 --> 0:22:31,000
and then see if we should do more than tweak.

446
0:22:32.119,000 --> 0:22:34,000
CA: OK, so this is what we're going to talk about

447
0:22:34.536,000 --> 0:22:35,000
for the last few minutes here

448
0:22:35.995,000 --> 0:22:37,000
because it's such an important discussion.

449
0:22:38.065,000 --> 0:22:41,000
First of all, this book was just published by Yuval Harari.

450
0:22:41.834,000 --> 0:22:45,000
He's basically saying the next evolution of humans is to become as gods.

451
0:22:46.003,000 --> 0:22:47,000
I think he --

452
0:22:47.178,000 --> 0:22:5,000
SB: Now, you've talked to him. And you've probably finished the book.

453
0:22:50.514,000 --> 0:22:51,000
I haven't finished it yet.

454
0:22:51.824,000 --> 0:22:52,000
Where does he come out on --

455
0:22:53.31,000 --> 0:22:57,000
CA: I mean, it's a pretty radical view.

456
0:22:57.496,000 --> 0:23:,000
He thinks that we will completely remake ourselves

457
0:23:00.944,000 --> 0:23:03,000
using data, using bioengineering,

458
0:23:04.443,000 --> 0:23:06,000
to become completely new creatures

459
0:23:06.607,000 --> 0:23:08,000
that have, kind of, superpowers,

460
0:23:08.657,000 --> 0:23:11,000
and that there will be huge inequality.

461
0:23:11.913,000 --> 0:23:16,000
But we're about to write a very radical, brand-new chapter of history.

462
0:23:17.21,000 --> 0:23:18,000
That's what he believes.

463
0:23:18.806,000 --> 0:23:19,000
SB: Is he nervous about that? I forget.

464
0:23:20.773,000 --> 0:23:22,000
CA: He's nervous about it,

465
0:23:23.238,000 --> 0:23:25,000
but I think he also likes provoking people.

466
0:23:26.154,000 --> 0:23:27,000
SB: Are you nervous about that?

467
0:23:28.163,000 --> 0:23:29,000
CA: I'm nervous about that.

468
0:23:29.605,000 --> 0:23:33,000
But, you know, with so much at TED, I'm excited and nervous.

469
0:23:33.694,000 --> 0:23:36,000
And the optimist in me is trying hard to lean towards

470
0:23:37.474,000 --> 0:23:39,000
"This is awesome and really exciting,"

471
0:23:39.586,000 --> 0:23:41,000
while the sort of responsible part of me is saying,

472
0:23:42.049,000 --> 0:23:44,000
"But, uh, maybe we should be a little bit careful

473
0:23:44.412,000 --> 0:23:45,000
as to how we think of it."

474
0:23:45.759,000 --> 0:23:47,000
SB: That's your secret sauce, isn't it, for TED?

475
0:23:48.155,000 --> 0:23:49,000
Staying nervous and excited.

476
0:23:50.91,000 --> 0:23:53,000
CA: It's also the recipe for being a little bit schizophrenic.

477
0:23:54.122,000 --> 0:23:58,000
But he didn't quote you.

478
0:23:58.831,000 --> 0:24:,000
What I thought was an astonishing statement that you made

479
0:24:01.595,000 --> 0:24:05,000
right back in the original Whole Earth Catalog,

480
0:24:05.872,000 --> 0:24:08,000
you ended it with this powerful phrase:

481
0:24:09.096,000 --> 0:24:12,000
"We are as gods, and might as well get good at it."

482
0:24:12.561,000 --> 0:24:14,000
And then more recently, you've upgraded that statement.

483
0:24:15.257,000 --> 0:24:16,000
I want you talk about this philosophy.

484
0:24:17.105,000 --> 0:24:2,000
SB: Well, one of the things I'm learning is that documentation

485
0:24:20.744,000 --> 0:24:22,000
is better than memory -- by far.

486
0:24:23.76,000 --> 0:24:25,000
And one of the things I've learned from somebody --

487
0:24:26.749,000 --> 0:24:28,000
I actually got on Twitter.

488
0:24:29.428,000 --> 0:24:32,000
It changed my life -- it hasn't forgiven me yet!

489
0:24:33.152,000 --> 0:24:37,000
And I took ownership of this phrase when somebody quoted it,

490
0:24:37.178,000 --> 0:24:38,000
and somebody else said,

491
0:24:38.758,000 --> 0:24:4,000
"Oh by the way, that isn't what you originally wrote

492
0:24:41.245,000 --> 0:24:43,000
in that first 1968 Whole Earth Catalog.

493
0:24:44.036,000 --> 0:24:47,000
You wrote, 'We are as gods and might as well get used to it.'"

494
0:24:47.128,000 --> 0:24:49,000
I'd forgotten that entirely.

495
0:24:49.413,000 --> 0:24:52,000
The stories -- these goddam stories -- the stories we tell ourselves

496
0:24:52.8,000 --> 0:24:53,000
become lies over time.

497
0:24:55.076,000 --> 0:24:57,000
So, documentation helps cut through that.

498
0:24:57.893,000 --> 0:25:,000
It did move on to "We are as gods and might as well get good at it,"

499
0:25:01.156,000 --> 0:25:02,000
and that was the Whole Earth Catalog.

500
0:25:03.065,000 --> 0:25:06,000
By the time I was doing a book called "Whole Earth Discipline:

501
0:25:06.153,000 --> 0:25:08,000
An Ecopragmatist Manifesto,"

502
0:25:08.543,000 --> 0:25:11,000
and in light of climate change, basically saying that we are as gods

503
0:25:11.759,000 --> 0:25:12,000
and have to get good at it.

504
0:25:13.382,000 --> 0:25:15,000
CA: We are as gods and have to get good at it.

505
0:25:15.67,000 --> 0:25:18,000
So talk about that, because the psychological reaction

506
0:25:19.253,000 --> 0:25:22,000
from so many people as soon as you talk about geoengineering

507
0:25:22.431,000 --> 0:25:25,000
is that the last thing they believe is that humans should be gods --

508
0:25:25.716,000 --> 0:25:26,000
some of them for religious reasons,

509
0:25:27.624,000 --> 0:25:29,000
but most just for humility reasons,

510
0:25:30.569,000 --> 0:25:31,000
that the systems are too complex,

511
0:25:32.214,000 --> 0:25:34,000
we should not be dabbling that way.

512
0:25:35.642,000 --> 0:25:38,000
SB: Well, this is the Greek narrative about hubris.

513
0:25:39.605,000 --> 0:25:42,000
And once you start getting really sure of yourself,

514
0:25:42.896,000 --> 0:25:44,000
you wind up sleeping with your mother.

515
0:25:45.577,000 --> 0:25:47,000
(Laughter)

516
0:25:48.219,000 --> 0:25:5,000
CA: I did not expect you would say that.

517
0:25:50.244,000 --> 0:25:51,000
(Laughter)

518
0:25:53.6,000 --> 0:25:55,000
SB: That's the Oedipus story.

519
0:25:56.212,000 --> 0:26:01,000
Hubris is a really important cautionary tale to always have at hand.

520
0:26:03.734,000 --> 0:26:06,000
One of the guidelines I've kept for myself is:

521
0:26:07.54,000 --> 0:26:11,000
every day I ask myself how many things I am dead wrong about.

522
0:26:13.393,000 --> 0:26:16,000
And I'm a scientist by training

523
0:26:16.506,000 --> 0:26:18,000
and getting to work with scientists these days,

524
0:26:18.849,000 --> 0:26:19,000
which is pure joy.

525
0:26:20.12,000 --> 0:26:23,000
Science is organized skepticism.

526
0:26:24.042,000 --> 0:26:27,000
So you're always insisting

527
0:26:27.602,000 --> 0:26:3,000
that even when something looks pretty good,

528
0:26:31.85,000 --> 0:26:34,000
you maintain a full set of not only suspicions

529
0:26:35.236,000 --> 0:26:37,000
about whether it's as good as it looks,

530
0:26:37.355,000 --> 0:26:38,000
but: What else is going on?

531
0:26:38.976,000 --> 0:26:41,000
So this "What else is going?" on query,

532
0:26:42.322,000 --> 0:26:46,000
I think, is how you get away from fake news.

533
0:26:46.449,000 --> 0:26:48,000
It's not necessarily real news,

534
0:26:50.274,000 --> 0:26:54,000
but it's welcomely more complex news

535
0:26:54.347,000 --> 0:26:55,000
that you're trying to take on.

536
0:26:55.908,000 --> 0:26:58,000
CA: But coming back to the application of this just for the environment:

537
0:26:59.393,000 --> 0:27:02,000
it seems like the philosophy of this is that, whether we like it or not,

538
0:27:02.857,000 --> 0:27:05,000
we are already dominating so many aspects of what happens on planets,

539
0:27:06.324,000 --> 0:27:07,000
and we're doing it unintentionally,

540
0:27:08.04,000 --> 0:27:12,000
so we really should start doing it intentionally.

541
0:27:12.445,000 --> 0:27:15,000
What would it look like to start getting good at being a god?

542
0:27:16.452,000 --> 0:27:18,000
How should we start doing that?

543
0:27:18.496,000 --> 0:27:21,000
Are there small-scale experiments or systems we can nudge and play with?

544
0:27:22.416,000 --> 0:27:23,000
How on earth do we think about it?

545
0:27:24.399,000 --> 0:27:25,000
SB: The mentor that sort of freed me

546
0:27:26.226,000 --> 0:27:28,000
from total allegiance to Buckminster Fuller

547
0:27:28.53,000 --> 0:27:29,000
was Gregory Bateson.

548
0:27:30.857,000 --> 0:27:36,000
And Gregory Bateson was an epistemologist and anthropologist and biologist

549
0:27:37.403,000 --> 0:27:38,000
and psychologist and many other things,

550
0:27:39.316,000 --> 0:27:44,000
and he looked at how systems basically look at themselves.

551
0:27:44.439,000 --> 0:27:49,000
And that is, I think, part of how you want to always be looking at things.

552
0:27:49.978,000 --> 0:27:52,000
And what I like about David Keith's approach to geoengineering

553
0:27:53.53,000 --> 0:27:54,000
is you don't just haul off and do it.

554
0:27:56.093,000 --> 0:27:57,000
David Keith's approach --

555
0:27:57.404,000 --> 0:28:,000
and this is what Danny Hillis was talking about earlier --

556
0:28:00.525,000 --> 0:28:02,000
is that you do it really, really incrementally,

557
0:28:02.994,000 --> 0:28:05,000
you do some stuff to tweak the system, see how it responds,

558
0:28:06.887,000 --> 0:28:08,000
that tells you something about the system.

559
0:28:08.932,000 --> 0:28:12,000
That's responding to the fact that people say, quite rightly,

560
0:28:13.369,000 --> 0:28:14,000
"What are we talking about here?

561
0:28:14.982,000 --> 0:28:16,000
We don't understand how the climate system works.

562
0:28:17.383,000 --> 0:28:19,000
You can't engineer a system you don't understand."

563
0:28:20.569,000 --> 0:28:23,000
And David says, "Well, that certainly applies to the human body,

564
0:28:23.776,000 --> 0:28:26,000
and yet medicine goes ahead, and we're kind of glad that it has."

565
0:28:27.582,000 --> 0:28:31,000
The way you engineer a system that is so large and complex

566
0:28:31.619,000 --> 0:28:33,000
that you can't completely understand it

567
0:28:33.663,000 --> 0:28:34,000
is you tweak it,

568
0:28:34.881,000 --> 0:28:36,000
and this is kind of an anti-hubristic approach.

569
0:28:37.506,000 --> 0:28:38,000
This is: try a little bit here,

570
0:28:39.447,000 --> 0:28:41,000
back the hell off if it's an issue,

571
0:28:41.575,000 --> 0:28:42,000
expand it if it seems to go OK,

572
0:28:43.406,000 --> 0:28:45,000
meanwhile, have other paths going forward.

573
0:28:45.432,000 --> 0:28:49,000
This is the whole argument for diversity and dialogue and all these other things

574
0:28:49.539,000 --> 0:28:52,000
and the things we were hearing about earlier with Sebastian [Thrun].

575
0:28:53.393,000 --> 0:28:59,000
So the non-hubristic approach is looking for social license,

576
0:28:59.907,000 --> 0:29:01,000
which is a terminology that I think is a good one,

577
0:29:02.472,000 --> 0:29:04,000
of including society enough

578
0:29:04.643,000 --> 0:29:08,000
in these interesting, problematic, deep issues

579
0:29:08.668,000 --> 0:29:11,000
that they get to have a pretty good idea

580
0:29:12.512,000 --> 0:29:14,000
and have people that they trust paying close attention

581
0:29:15.327,000 --> 0:29:18,000
to the sequence of experiments as it's going forward,

582
0:29:19.175,000 --> 0:29:22,000
the public dialogue as it's going forward --

583
0:29:22.218,000 --> 0:29:25,000
which is more public than ever, which is fantastic --

584
0:29:25.337,000 --> 0:29:27,000
and you feel your way,

585
0:29:28.653,000 --> 0:29:29,000
you just ooze your way along,

586
0:29:30.36,000 --> 0:29:34,000
and this is the muddle-through approach that has worked pretty well so far.

587
0:29:34.994,000 --> 0:29:37,000
The reason that Sebastian and I are optimistic is we read

588
0:29:38.627,000 --> 0:29:41,000
people like Steven Pinker, "The Better Angels of Our Nature,"

589
0:29:42.124,000 --> 0:29:44,000
and so far, so good.

590
0:29:45.078,000 --> 0:29:48,000
Now, that can always change,

591
0:29:48.203,000 --> 0:29:53,000
but you can build a lot on that sense of: things are capable of getting better,

592
0:29:54.587,000 --> 0:29:57,000
figure out the tools that made that happen and apply those further.

593
0:29:57.812,000 --> 0:29:58,000
That's the story.

594
0:29:59.475,000 --> 0:30:01,000
CA: Stewart, I think on that optimistic note,

595
0:30:01.804,000 --> 0:30:02,000
we're actually going to wrap up.

596
0:30:03.49,000 --> 0:30:08,000
I am in awe of how you always are willing to challenge yourself

597
0:30:08.631,000 --> 0:30:09,000
and other people.

598
0:30:10.01,000 --> 0:30:15,000
I feel like this recipe for never allowing yourself to be too certain

599
0:30:15.815,000 --> 0:30:16,000
is so powerful.

600
0:30:17.242,000 --> 0:30:18,000
I want to learn it more for myself,

601
0:30:19.197,000 --> 0:30:23,000
and it's been very insightful and inspiring, actually,

602
0:30:23.298,000 --> 0:30:24,000
listening to you today.

603
0:30:24.503,000 --> 0:30:25,000
Stewart Brand, thank you so much.

604
0:30:26.128,000 --> 0:30:27,000
SB: Thank you.

605
0:30:27.31,000 --> 0:30:3,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.687,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Visible from space,

2
0:00:13.866,000 --> 0:00:14,000
the Okavango Delta

3
0:00:15.517,000 --> 0:00:19,000
is Africa's largest remaining intact wetland wilderness.

4
0:00:20.255,000 --> 0:00:25,000
This shining delta in landlocked Botswana is the jewel of the Kalahari,

5
0:00:26.12,000 --> 0:00:3,000
more valuable than diamonds to the world's largest diamond producer

6
0:00:30.573,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and celebrated in 2014

7
0:00:32.986,000 --> 0:00:35,000
as our planet's 1000th UNESCO World Heritage Site.

8
0:00:36.495,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Now, what you see here are the two major tributaries,

9
0:00:39.424,000 --> 0:00:41,000
the Cuito and the Cubango,

10
0:00:41.465,000 --> 0:00:45,000
disappearing up north into the little-known Angolan highlands.

11
0:00:45.615,000 --> 0:00:49,000
This is the largest undeveloped river basin on the planet,

12
0:00:49.938,000 --> 0:00:51,000
spanning an area larger than California.

13
0:00:53.09,000 --> 0:00:57,000
These vast, undeveloped Angolan watersheds were frozen in time

14
0:00:57.194,000 --> 0:00:59,000
by 27 years of civil war.

15
0:00:59.576,000 --> 0:01:03,000
In fact, Africa's largest tank battle since World War II

16
0:01:03.601,000 --> 0:01:06,000
was fought over a bridge crossing the Okavango's Cuito River.

17
0:01:07.057,000 --> 0:01:08,000
There on the right,

18
0:01:08.472,000 --> 0:01:09,000
disappearing off into the unknown,

19
0:01:10.25,000 --> 0:01:12,000
into the "Terra do fim do mundo" --

20
0:01:12.623,000 --> 0:01:13,000
the land at the end of the earth,

21
0:01:14.575,000 --> 0:01:16,000
as it was known by the first Portuguese explorers.

22
0:01:18.275,000 --> 0:01:21,000
In 2001, at the age of 22,

23
0:01:21.672,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I took a job as head of housekeeping at Vundumtiki Camp

24
0:01:25.588,000 --> 0:01:27,000
in the Okavango Delta ...

25
0:01:27.712,000 --> 0:01:31,000
a patchwork mosaic of channels, floodplains, lagoons

26
0:01:32.34,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and thousands upon thousands of islands to explore.

27
0:01:36.289,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Home to the largest remaining population of elephants on the planet.

28
0:01:40.311,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Rhinos are airlifted in C130s to find sanctuary in this wilderness.

29
0:01:46.065,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Lion,

30
0:01:47.239,000 --> 0:01:48,000
leopard,

31
0:01:48.505,000 --> 0:01:49,000
hyena,

32
0:01:49.757,000 --> 0:01:5,000
wild dog,

33
0:01:50.952,000 --> 0:01:51,000
cheetah,

34
0:01:52.249,000 --> 0:01:55,000
ancient baobab trees that stand like cathedrals

35
0:01:56.048,000 --> 0:01:57,000
under the Milky Way.

36
0:01:57.559,000 --> 0:02:,000
Here, I discovered something obvious:

37
0:02:01.15,000 --> 0:02:04,000
wilderness is our natural habitat, too.

38
0:02:04.272,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We need these last wild places to reconnect with who we really are.

39
0:02:10.129,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We --

40
0:02:11.304,000 --> 0:02:12,000
all seven billion of us --

41
0:02:12.626,000 --> 0:02:15,000
must never forget we are a biological species

42
0:02:16.081,000 --> 0:02:19,000
forever bound to this particular biological world.

43
0:02:19.154,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Like the waves connected to the ocean,

44
0:02:21.445,000 --> 0:02:22,000
we cannot exist apart from it --

45
0:02:23.026,000 --> 0:02:27,000
a constant flow of atoms and energy between individuals and species

46
0:02:27.838,000 --> 0:02:28,000
around the world in a day

47
0:02:29.509,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and out into the cosmos.

48
0:02:33.022,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Our fates are forever connected to the millions of species

49
0:02:36.658,000 --> 0:02:4,000
we rely on directly and indirectly every day.

50
0:02:42.237,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Four years ago,

51
0:02:43.531,000 --> 0:02:47,000
it was declared that 50 percent of all wildlife around the world

52
0:02:47.894,000 --> 0:02:49,000
had disappeared in just 40 years.

53
0:02:51.5,000 --> 0:02:54,000
This is a mass drowning of 15,000 wildebeests

54
0:02:54.56,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that I witnessed in the Maasai Mara two years ago.

55
0:02:57.946,000 --> 0:02:59,000
This is definitely our fault.

56
0:03:01.376,000 --> 0:03:05,000
By 2020, global wildlife populations are projected to have fallen

57
0:03:05.607,000 --> 0:03:07,000
by a staggering two-thirds.

58
0:03:07.821,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We are the sixth extinction

59
0:03:10.036,000 --> 0:03:13,000
because we left no safe space for millions of species

60
0:03:13.175,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to sustainably coexist.

61
0:03:16.174,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Now, since 2010, I have poled myself eight times across the Okavango Delta

62
0:03:22.001,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to conduct detailed scientific surveys

63
0:03:24.764,000 --> 0:03:27,000
along a 200-mile, 18-day research transect.

64
0:03:28.158,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Now, why am I doing this?

65
0:03:29.387,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Why am I risking my life each year?

66
0:03:31.078,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I'm doing this because we need this information

67
0:03:33.323,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to benchmark this near-pristine wilderness

68
0:03:35.347,000 --> 0:03:36,000
before upstream development happens.

69
0:03:37.852,000 --> 0:03:42,000
These are the Wayeyi river bushmen, the people of the Okavango Delta.

70
0:03:43.323,000 --> 0:03:45,000
They have taught me all I know about the Mother Okavango --

71
0:03:46.167,000 --> 0:03:47,000
about presence in the wild.

72
0:03:47.857,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Our shared pilgrimage across the Okavango Delta each year

73
0:03:51.893,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in our mokoros or dugout canoes --

74
0:03:53.894,000 --> 0:03:55,000
remembers millenia living in the wild.

75
0:03:57.805,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Ten thousand years ago,

76
0:03:59.596,000 --> 0:04:01,000
our entire world was wilderness.

77
0:04:02.99,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Today, wilderness is all that remains of that world, now gone.

78
0:04:09.675,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Ten thousand years ago, we were as we are today:

79
0:04:13.215,000 --> 0:04:16,000
a modern, dreaming intelligence unlike anything seen before.

80
0:04:17.054,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Living in the wilderness is what taught us to speak,

81
0:04:19.527,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to seek technologies like fire and stone, bow and arrow,

82
0:04:23.133,000 --> 0:04:24,000
medicine and poison,

83
0:04:24.989,000 --> 0:04:26,000
to domesticate plants and animals

84
0:04:27.182,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and rely on each other and all living things around us.

85
0:04:30.461,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We are these last wildernesses --

86
0:04:32.86,000 --> 0:04:33,000
every one of us.

87
0:04:34.801,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Over 80 percent of our planet's land surface

88
0:04:36.892,000 --> 0:04:39,000
is now experiencing measurable human impact:

89
0:04:40.065,000 --> 0:04:41,000
habitat destruction

90
0:04:41.438,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and illegal wildlife trade are decimating global wildlife populations.

91
0:04:45.306,000 --> 0:04:48,000
We urgently need to create safe space for these wild animals.

92
0:04:49.766,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So in late 2014,

93
0:04:51.535,000 --> 0:04:53,000
we launched an ambitious project to do just that:

94
0:04:54.14,000 --> 0:04:55,000
explore and protect.

95
0:04:56.472,000 --> 0:04:57,000
By mid-May 2015,

96
0:04:58.421,000 --> 0:05:,000
we had pioneered access through active minefields

97
0:05:00.774,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to the undocumented source lake of the Cuito River --

98
0:05:03.441,000 --> 0:05:05,000
this otherworldly place;

99
0:05:05.565,000 --> 0:05:06,000
an ancient, untouched wilderness.

100
0:05:08.385,000 --> 0:05:09,000
By the 21st of May,

101
0:05:09.704,000 --> 0:05:12,000
we had launched the Okavango megatransect ...

102
0:05:13.037,000 --> 0:05:14,000
in seven dugout canoes;

103
0:05:14.722,000 --> 0:05:18,000
1,500 miles, 121 days later,

104
0:05:18.823,000 --> 0:05:2,000
all of the poling, paddling and intensive research

105
0:05:21.357,000 --> 0:05:24,000
got us across the entire river basin to Lake Xau in the Kalahari Desert,

106
0:05:25.143,000 --> 0:05:28,000
480 kilometers past the Okavango Delta.

107
0:05:29.08,000 --> 0:05:31,000
My entire world became the water:

108
0:05:31.668,000 --> 0:05:34,000
every ripple, eddy, lily pad and current ...

109
0:05:36.397,000 --> 0:05:37,000
any sign of danger,

110
0:05:38.17,000 --> 0:05:39,000
every sign of life.

111
0:05:40.952,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Now imagine millions of sweat bees choking the air around you,

112
0:05:43.928,000 --> 0:05:44,000
flesh-eating bacteria,

113
0:05:45.189,000 --> 0:05:48,000
the constant threat of a landmine going off

114
0:05:48.603,000 --> 0:05:5,000
or an unseen hippo capsizing your mokoro.

115
0:05:50.959,000 --> 0:05:52,000
These are the scenes moments after a hippo did just that --

116
0:05:53.897,000 --> 0:05:55,000
thrusting its tusks through the hull of my boat.

117
0:05:56.201,000 --> 0:05:57,000
You can see the two holes --

118
0:05:57.91,000 --> 0:05:59,000
puncture wounds in the base of the hull --

119
0:06:00.016,000 --> 0:06:01,000
absolutely terrifying

120
0:06:01.764,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and completely my fault.

121
0:06:03.934,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Laughter)

122
0:06:05.321,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Many, many portages,

123
0:06:07.428,000 --> 0:06:1,000
tree blockages and capsizes in rocky rapids.

124
0:06:12.904,000 --> 0:06:14,000
You're living on rice and beans,

125
0:06:15.049,000 --> 0:06:16,000
bathing in a bucket of cold water

126
0:06:16.983,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and paddling a marathon six to eight hours every single day.

127
0:06:19.838,000 --> 0:06:2,000
After 121 days of this,

128
0:06:21.83,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I'd forgotten the PIN numbers to my bank accounts

129
0:06:24.181,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and logins for social media --

130
0:06:25.655,000 --> 0:06:27,000
a complete systems reboot.

131
0:06:28.041,000 --> 0:06:3,000
You ask me now if I miss it,

132
0:06:30.578,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and I will tell you I am still there.

133
0:06:33.789,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Now why do we need to save places we hardly ever go?

134
0:06:36.653,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Why do we need to save places

135
0:06:38.426,000 --> 0:06:4,000
where you have to risk your life to be there?

136
0:06:40.549,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Now, I'm not a religious or particularly spiritual person,

137
0:06:44.817,000 --> 0:06:45,000
but in the wild,

138
0:06:46.011,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I believe I've experienced the birthplace of religion.

139
0:06:50.336,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Standing in front of an elephant far away from anywhere

140
0:06:53.448,000 --> 0:06:56,000
is the closest I will ever get to God.

141
0:06:57.258,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Moses, Buddha, Muhammad, Jesus,

142
0:06:59.627,000 --> 0:07:01,000
the Hindu teachers, prophets and mystics,

143
0:07:01.935,000 --> 0:07:02,000
all went into the wilderness --

144
0:07:03.467,000 --> 0:07:04,000
up into the mountains, into the desert,

145
0:07:05.364,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to sit quietly and listen for those secrets

146
0:07:07.618,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that were to guide their societies for millennia.

147
0:07:10.155,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I go into the Okavango on my mokoro.

148
0:07:13.204,000 --> 0:07:14,000
You must join me one day.

149
0:07:16.522,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Over 50 percent of the remaining wilderness is unprotected.

150
0:07:19.936,000 --> 0:07:2,000
A huge opportunity --

151
0:07:21.872,000 --> 0:07:22,000
a chance for us all.

152
0:07:25.253,000 --> 0:07:27,000
We need to act with great urgency.

153
0:07:27.702,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Since the 2015 megatransect,

154
0:07:30.111,000 --> 0:07:33,000
we have explored all major rivers of the Okavango River basin,

155
0:07:33.193,000 --> 0:07:36,000
covering a life-changing 4,000 miles of detailed research transects

156
0:07:37.15,000 --> 0:07:38,000
on our dugout canoes

157
0:07:38.464,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and our fat-tire mountain bikes.

158
0:07:40.505,000 --> 0:07:42,000
We now have 57 top scientists

159
0:07:43.001,000 --> 0:07:46,000
rediscovering what we call the Okavango-Zambezi water tower --

160
0:07:47.002,000 --> 0:07:53,000
this vast, post-war wilderness with undocumented source lakes,

161
0:07:53.671,000 --> 0:07:57,000
unnamed waterfalls in what is Africa's largest remaining Miombo woodland.

162
0:07:59.48,000 --> 0:08:01,000
We've now discovered 24 new species to science

163
0:08:02.266,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and hundreds of species not known to be there.

164
0:08:05.124,000 --> 0:08:08,000
This year, we start the process, with the Angolan government,

165
0:08:08.37,000 --> 0:08:11,000
to establish one of the largest systems of protected areas in the world

166
0:08:12.194,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to preserve the Okavango-Zambezi water tower

167
0:08:14.62,000 --> 0:08:15,000
we have been exploring.

168
0:08:15.819,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Downstream, this represents water security for millions of people

169
0:08:19.79,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and more than half of the elephants remaining on this planet.

170
0:08:23.131,000 --> 0:08:27,000
There is no doubt this is the biggest conservation opportunity in Africa

171
0:08:27.262,000 --> 0:08:28,000
in decades.

172
0:08:28.532,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Over the next 10 to 15 years,

173
0:08:29.966,000 --> 0:08:31,000
we need to make an unprecedented investment

174
0:08:32.263,000 --> 0:08:34,000
in the preservation of wilderness around the world.

175
0:08:35.348,000 --> 0:08:36,000
To me,

176
0:08:36.522,000 --> 0:08:4,000
preserving wilderness is far more than simply protecting ecosystems

177
0:08:41.205,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that clean the water we drink and create the air we breathe.

178
0:08:44.682,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Preserving wilderness protects our basic human right to be wild --

179
0:08:48.986,000 --> 0:08:5,000
our basic human rights to explore.

180
0:08:52.241,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Thank you.

181
0:08:53.495,000 --> 0:08:59,000

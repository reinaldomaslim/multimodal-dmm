1
0:00:12.833,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I am a labor organizer,

2
0:00:15.032,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and in 2013, I cofounded an organization called coworker.org

3
0:00:19.855,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that uses technology to help people join with coworkers

4
0:00:24.128,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and organize for improvements in the workplace.

5
0:00:27.986,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Now, there are two kinds of reactions to what I do.

6
0:00:31.157,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Actually, no, there are three.

7
0:00:33.001,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The first is complete confusion about what organizing is.

8
0:00:37.426,000 --> 0:00:39,000
When my doctor asked what I do and I told him,

9
0:00:39.985,000 --> 0:00:42,000
he thought I meant organizing, like, Marie Kondo-style.

10
0:00:43.778,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:44.82,000 --> 0:00:47,000
He was like, "Oh, that's so great, I could use some of that around here.

12
0:00:48.5,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I would love to clean up our patient files."

13
0:00:50.781,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And I had to explain to him that no, no, it's not that kind of organizing,

14
0:00:54.958,000 --> 0:00:56,000
it's more like if you showed up to work tomorrow

15
0:00:57.524,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and all the nurses in the office had gotten together

16
0:01:00.047,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to ask for an across-the-board raise.

17
0:01:01.88,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:03.045,000 --> 0:01:06,000
"Oh," he replied, and he got really quiet.

19
0:01:06.785,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:07.795,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Yeah, and that's the second kind of reaction:

21
0:01:10.601,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the uncomfortable kind.

22
0:01:12.212,000 --> 0:01:14,000
People usually withdraw from the conversation

23
0:01:14.387,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and find someone else to talk to.

24
0:01:17.428,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Finally, there's the third reaction,

25
0:01:19.537,000 --> 0:01:2,000
the excited one,

26
0:01:20.878,000 --> 0:01:22,000
the, "Oh my God, yes! We need this!"

27
0:01:23.644,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And someone always proceeds to tell me a story.

28
0:01:26.72,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It's always a story about a job or a coworker or a friend

29
0:01:30.829,000 --> 0:01:32,000
who's enduring something awful at work.

30
0:01:33.197,000 --> 0:01:37,000
What I've noticed is that there is never a neutral response to what I do.

31
0:01:37.231,000 --> 0:01:39,000
You're either repelled by it,

32
0:01:39.466,000 --> 0:01:42,000
or you're struck with a lightning bolt of excitement.

33
0:01:43.113,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So why does my work stir up such strong reactions?

34
0:01:47.308,000 --> 0:01:49,000
My hunch is that it's about conflict.

35
0:01:50.033,000 --> 0:01:52,000
If you have power in your workplace,

36
0:01:52.358,000 --> 0:01:55,000
maybe as a CEO or a senior leader of some kind,

37
0:01:56.275,000 --> 0:02:,000
you're going to feel uncomfortable with that power being challenged.

38
0:02:00.533,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But if you lack power, or you know someone who lacks it and needs it,

39
0:02:04.427,000 --> 0:02:07,000
you might grab me by the shoulders and shake me, you're so pumped.

40
0:02:08.165,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But really, we can all benefit from understanding

41
0:02:12.018,000 --> 0:02:14,000
what conflict can offer in our workplaces.

42
0:02:15.102,000 --> 0:02:17,000
The power imbalance in our workplace is real,

43
0:02:17.911,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and it's constantly changing.

44
0:02:19.912,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Power moves between us, depending on our roles and status.

45
0:02:24.382,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Now, sometimes this can feel like office politics, right?

46
0:02:27.81,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Which is never fun.

47
0:02:29.594,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But when we contest for power thoughtfully

48
0:02:32.113,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and together with our coworkers,

49
0:02:34.105,000 --> 0:02:36,000
it can be incredibly productive.

50
0:02:36.427,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And it's that kind of productive conflict

51
0:02:38.479,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that I want to talk to you all about today,

52
0:02:40.558,000 --> 0:02:42,000
the kind that can make some of us uncomfortable.

53
0:02:43.19,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Business leaders should embrace

54
0:02:44.742,000 --> 0:02:47,000
when their workers conflict with policies and decisions,

55
0:02:47.925,000 --> 0:02:49,000
both for what it teaches us

56
0:02:50.01,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and for what it says about our commitment to each other.

57
0:02:53.941,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So what do I mean by "productive conflict"?

58
0:02:56.225,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Well, let me tell you a story.

59
0:02:58.406,000 --> 0:03:02,000
In 2016, a store employee for an outdoor retailer --

60
0:03:02.909,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I'll call her "Alex" --

61
0:03:04.36,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Alex approached her boss and asked for a raise.

62
0:03:07.608,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Now, she was told her pay was fairly standard for her position

63
0:03:10.898,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and that her boss didn't even have the authority to give such a raise.

64
0:03:14.768,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And that was supposed to be the end of the conversation.

65
0:03:18.107,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Unhappy with that answer,

66
0:03:19.678,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Alex went home, and she decided to create a campaign on coworker.org,

67
0:03:23.575,000 --> 0:03:27,000
asking the corporate office to give raises to store employees.

68
0:03:27.893,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Within days, employees from around the country

69
0:03:30.263,000 --> 0:03:32,000
began joining Alex's effort and sharing their own stories

70
0:03:33.213,000 --> 0:03:34,000
about what they were earning --

71
0:03:34.779,000 --> 0:03:35,000
11, 12 dollars an hour --

72
0:03:36.391,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and how that wage was impacting their lives.

73
0:03:38.788,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Some even shared that they had quit recently

74
0:03:41.63,000 --> 0:03:43,000
to work for competitors who paid more.

75
0:03:44.011,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But here's the thing: they also shared that they didn't want to quit,

76
0:03:47.318,000 --> 0:03:49,000
they liked their job, they believed in the company's mission,

77
0:03:50.214,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but for them, the pay issue was a growing problem in their work lives.

78
0:03:55.974,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Well, after weeks of this groundswell of employee activism,

79
0:04:00.42,000 --> 0:04:01,000
the company decided to raise wages

80
0:04:02.166,000 --> 0:04:05,000
by five to 15 percent in cities across the country.

81
0:04:05.873,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And that's what I mean by productive conflict:

82
0:04:08.041,000 --> 0:04:1,000
pushing up against the things that aren't working for us

83
0:04:10.738,000 --> 0:04:11,000
when there exists no other path forward.

84
0:04:13.681,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The other thing I learned in doing this work

85
0:04:16.031,000 --> 0:04:18,000
is that people engage in productive conflict

86
0:04:18.142,000 --> 0:04:21,000
when they care about their jobs and their coworkers.

87
0:04:21.981,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Now, that surprised me at first.

88
0:04:24.035,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I expected the worst jobs, the worst workplaces,

89
0:04:26.964,000 --> 0:04:28,000
to have the most employee activism on our site,

90
0:04:29.55,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but the opposite is often true.

91
0:04:32.836,000 --> 0:04:36,000
When we come together, we can accomplish great things.

92
0:04:37.638,000 --> 0:04:38,000
At one company,

93
0:04:39.247,000 --> 0:04:41,000
there are more than 50 campaigns by employees there

94
0:04:42.086,000 --> 0:04:47,000
on issues ranging from dress code changes to legitimate safety concerns.

95
0:04:47.404,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And get this:

96
0:04:48.977,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that same company has the lowest voluntary turnover rate

97
0:04:53.38,000 --> 0:04:55,000
of any major chain in its sector.

98
0:04:55.792,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And it also has one of the higher productivity rates as well.

99
0:05:01.106,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Business leaders: you shouldn't fear conflict,

100
0:05:03.947,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and you shouldn't try to tamp down on it

101
0:05:05.905,000 --> 0:05:07,000
the minute it bubbles up in your workforce.

102
0:05:08.626,000 --> 0:05:12,000
While it can introduce uncertainties that can be difficult to manage,

103
0:05:13.281,000 --> 0:05:16,000
those uncertainties are trying to tell you something

104
0:05:16.66,000 --> 0:05:19,000
about an underlying problem that needs your attention.

105
0:05:20.592,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And I think this is especially important right now,

106
0:05:23.659,000 --> 0:05:27,000
you know, as technology transforms nearly everyone's job

107
0:05:28.173,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and as the structures that contain our work

108
0:05:31.065,000 --> 0:05:34,000
are changing at a pace not seen since the Industrial Revolution.

109
0:05:35.513,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We all need to be shaping and participating in the future of work.

110
0:05:40.541,000 --> 0:05:43,000
We all need to be challenging and changing the parts of our work lives

111
0:05:44.532,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that are broken.

112
0:05:47.027,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So I hope the next time a coworker invites you

113
0:05:50.423,000 --> 0:05:53,000
maybe to join a sign-on letter to your boss,

114
0:05:53.709,000 --> 0:05:55,000
or a group of employees asks for a meeting

115
0:05:56.498,000 --> 0:05:59,000
to discuss their concerns about the new health care plan,

116
0:06:00.058,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I hope you'll consider it an opportunity

117
0:06:03.14,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to build a better workplace,

118
0:06:05.124,000 --> 0:06:07,000
a stronger business

119
0:06:07.424,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and an economy that works for all of us.

120
0:06:10.081,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Thank you.

121
0:06:11.428,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I believe that there are new, hidden tensions

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that are actually happening between people and institutions --

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
institutions that are the institutions that people

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
inhabit in their daily life:

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
schools, hospitals, workplaces,

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
factories, offices, etc.

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And something that I see happening

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
is something that I would like to call

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
a sort of "democratization of intimacy."

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And what do I mean by that?

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I mean that what people are doing

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
is, in fact, they are sort of, with their communication channels,

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
they are breaking an imposed isolation

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that these institutions are imposing on them.

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
How are they doing this? They're doing it

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
in a very simple way, by calling their mom from work,

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
by IMing from their office to their friends,

18
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
by texting under the desk.

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The pictures that you're seeing behind me

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
are people that I visited in the last few months.

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most.

22
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And somebody brought a boyfriend, somebody a father.

23
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
One young woman brought her grandfather.

24
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
For 20 years, I've been looking at how people use

25
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
channels such as email, the mobile phone, texting, etc.

26
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
What we're actually going to see is that, fundamentally,

27
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
people are communicating on a regular basis

28
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
with five, six, seven of their most intimate sphere.

29
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Now, lets take some data. Facebook.

30
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Recently some sociologists from Facebook --

31
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Facebook is the channel that you would expect

32
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
is the most enlargening of all channels.

33
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And an average user,

34
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
said Cameron Marlow,

35
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
from Facebook, has about 120 friends.

36
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But he actually talks to,

37
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
has two-way exchanges with, about four to six people

38
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
on a regular base, depending on his gender.

39
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Academic research on instant messaging

40
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
also shows 100 people on buddy lists,

41
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
but fundamentally people chat with two, three, four --

42
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
anyway, less than five.

43
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
My own research on cellphones and voice calls

44
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
shows that 80 percent of the calls

45
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
are actually made to four people. 80 percent.

46
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And when you go to Skype, it's down to two people.

47
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
A lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed.

48
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I mean, I've been a bit disappointed sometimes

49
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
when I saw this data and all this deployment, just for five people.

50
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And some sociologists actually feel that

51
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
it's a closure, it's a cocooning,

52
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that we're disengaging from the public.

53
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And I would actually, I would like to show you that

54
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
if we actually look at who is doing it,

55
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and from where they're doing it,

56
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
actually there is an incredible social transformation.

57
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
There are three stories that I think are quite good examples.

58
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The first gentleman, he's a baker.

59
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in the morning.

60
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And around eight o'clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven,

61
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
cleans his hands from the flour

62
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and calls his wife.

63
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
He just wants to wish her a good day, because that's the start of her day.

64
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And I've heard this story a number of times.

65
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
A young factory worker who works night shifts,

66
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
who manages to sneak away from the factory floor,

67
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
where there is CCTV by the way,

68
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and find a corner, where at 11 o'clock at night

69
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
he can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight.

70
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Or a mother who, at four o'clock,

71
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet

72
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to check that her children are safely home.

73
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Then there is another couple, there is a Brazilian couple.

74
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
They've lived in Italy for a number of years.

75
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
They Skype with their families a few times a week.

76
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But once a fortnight, they actually put the computer on their dining table,

77
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
pull out the webcam and actually have dinner

78
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
with their family in Sao Paulo. And they have a big event of it.

79
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And I heard this story the first time a couple of years ago

80
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
from a very modest family

81
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
of immigrants from Kosovo in Switzerland.

82
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
They had set up a big screen in their living room,

83
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother.

84
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But Danny Miller, who is a very good anthropologist

85
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
who is working on Filipina migrant women

86
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
who leave their children back in the Philippines,

87
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
was telling me about how much parenting is going on

88
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
through Skype,

89
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and how much these mothers are engaged with their children through Skype.

90
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And then there is the third couple. They are two friends.

91
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
They chat to each other every day, a few times a day actually.

92
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And finally, finally, they've managed to put

93
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
instant messaging on their computers at work.

94
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And now, obviously, they have it open.

95
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Whenever they have a moment they chat to each other.

96
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And this is exactly what we've been seeing

97
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
with teenagers and kids doing it in school, under the table,

98
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and texting under the table to their friends.

99
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So, none of these cases are unique.

100
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I mean, I could tell you hundreds of them.

101
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But what is really exceptional is the setting.

102
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So, think of the three settings I've talked to you about:

103
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
factory, migration, office.

104
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But it could be in a school, it could be an administration,

105
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
it could be a hospital.

106
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Three settings that, if we just step back 15 years,

107
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
if you just think back 15 years,

108
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
when you clocked in,

109
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
when you clocked in to an office,

110
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
when you clocked in to a factory,

111
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
there was no contact for the whole duration of the time,

112
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
there was no contact with your private sphere.

113
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
If you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere.

114
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
If you were in management, oh, that was a different story.

115
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Maybe you had a direct line.

116
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
If you were not, you maybe had to go through an operator.

117
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
But basically, when you walked into those buildings,

118
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
the private sphere was left behind you.

119
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And this has become such a norm of our professional lives,

120
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
such a norm and such an expectation.

121
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And it had nothing to do with technical capability.

122
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
The phones were there. But the expectation was once you moved in there

123
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
your commitment was fully to the task at hand,

124
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
fully to the people around you.

125
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
That was where the focus had to be.

126
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
And this has become such a cultural norm

127
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage.

128
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
If you think nursery, kindergarten, first years of school

129
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
are just dedicated to take away the children,

130
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to make them used to staying long hours away from their family.

131
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And then the school enacts perfectly well.

132
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices:

133
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
rituals of entry, rituals of exit,

134
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
the schedules, the uniforms in this country,

135
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
things that identify you, team-building activities,

136
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
team building that will allow you to basically

137
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
be with a random group of kids, or a random group of people

138
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that you will have to be with for a number of time.

139
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And of course, the major thing:

140
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
learn to pay attention,

141
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to concentrate and focus your attention.

142
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
This only started about 150 years ago.

143
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy,

144
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and of industrial revolution.

145
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
When people basically had to go somewhere else to work

146
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and carry out the work.

147
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach,

148
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere

149
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and the public sphere.

150
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So, until then, basically people were living on top of their trades.

151
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
They were living on top of the land they were laboring.

152
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
They were living on top of the workshops where they were working.

153
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And if you think, it's permeated our whole culture,

154
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
even our cities.

155
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
If you think of medieval cities, medieval cities the boroughs

156
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
all have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there.

157
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Now we have sprawling residential suburbias

158
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that are well distinct from production areas

159
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and commercial areas.

160
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And actually, over these 150 years,

161
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged.

162
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So the lower the status of the job

163
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and of the person carrying out, the more removed

164
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
he would be from his personal sphere.

165
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
People have taken this amazing possibility

166
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
of actually being in contact all through the day

167
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
or in all types of situations.

168
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And they are doing it massively.

169
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
The Pew Institute, which produces good data

170
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
on a regular basis on, for instance, in the States,

171
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
says that -- and I think that this number is conservative --

172
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
50 percent of anybody with email access at work

173
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
is actually doing private email from his office.

174
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I really think that the number is conservative.

175
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
In my own research, we saw that the peak for private email

176
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
is actually 11 o'clock in the morning, whatever the country.

177
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
75 percent of people admit doing private

178
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
conversations from work on their mobile phones.

179
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
100 percent are using text.

180
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
The point is that this re-appropriation of the personal sphere

181
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
is not terribly successful with all institutions.

182
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I'm always surprised the U.S. Army

183
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
sociologists are discussing of the impact

184
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
for instance, of soldiers in Iraq

185
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
having daily contact with their families.

186
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
But there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access.

187
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And every day, every single day,

188
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I read news that makes me cringe,

189
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
like a $15 fine

190
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
to kids in Texas,

191
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
for using, every time they take out their mobile phone in school.

192
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Immediate dismissal to bus drivers in New York,

193
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
if seen with a mobile phone in a hand.

194
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook.

195
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Behind issues of security and safety,

196
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
which have always been the arguments for social control,

197
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
in fact what is going on is that

198
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
these institutions are trying to decide

199
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
who, in fact, has a right to self determine their attention,

200
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
to decide, whether they should, or not, be isolated.

201
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And they are actually trying to block, in a certain sense,

202
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
this movement of a greater possibility of intimacy.

1
0:00:13.309,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Do you remember a time when you felt hormonal and moody?

2
0:00:17.263,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Your skin was breaking out,

3
0:00:19.271,000 --> 0:00:23,000
your body was growing in strange places and very fast,

4
0:00:24.235,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and at the same time,

5
0:00:25.416,000 --> 0:00:27,000
people were expecting you to be grown-up in this new way.

6
0:00:29.096,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Teenagers, right?

7
0:00:31.344,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Well, these same changes happen to a woman when she's having a baby.

8
0:00:36.179,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And we know that it's normal for teenagers to feel all over the place,

9
0:00:40.557,000 --> 0:00:43,000
so why don't we talk about pregnancy in the same way?

10
0:00:44.85,000 --> 0:00:49,000
There are entire textbooks written about the developmental arc of adolescence,

11
0:00:50.527,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and we don't even have a word to describe the transition to motherhood.

12
0:00:55.271,000 --> 0:00:56,000
We need one.

13
0:00:57.272,000 --> 0:01:,000
I'm a psychiatrist who works with pregnant and postpartum women,

14
0:01:00.526,000 --> 0:01:01,000
a reproductive psychiatrist,

15
0:01:02.206,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and in the decade that I've been working in this field,

16
0:01:05.148,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I've noticed a pattern.

17
0:01:06.892,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It goes something like this:

18
0:01:08.872,000 --> 0:01:09,000
a woman calls me up,

19
0:01:10.354,000 --> 0:01:11,000
she's just had a baby,

20
0:01:12.059,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and she's concerned.

21
0:01:13.521,000 --> 0:01:17,000
She says, "I'm not good at this. I'm not enjoying this.

22
0:01:17.98,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Do I have postpartum depression?"

23
0:01:20.615,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So I go through the symptoms of that diagnosis,

24
0:01:23.004,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and it's clear to me that she's not clinically depressed,

25
0:01:26.017,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and I tell her that.

26
0:01:27.521,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But she isn't reassured.

27
0:01:29.438,000 --> 0:01:32,000
"It isn't supposed to feel like this," she insists.

28
0:01:32.617,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So I say, "OK. What did you expect it to feel like?"

29
0:01:36.495,000 --> 0:01:4,000
She says, "I thought motherhood would make feel whole and happy.

30
0:01:41.708,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I thought my instincts would naturally tell me what to do.

31
0:01:45.606,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I thought I'd always want to put the baby first."

32
0:01:49.463,000 --> 0:01:53,000
This -- this is an unrealistic expectation

33
0:01:53.608,000 --> 0:01:55,000
of what the transition to motherhood feels like.

34
0:01:56.636,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And it wasn't just her.

35
0:01:58.708,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I was getting calls with questions like this from hundreds of women,

36
0:02:03.687,000 --> 0:02:05,000
all concerned that something was wrong,

37
0:02:06.361,000 --> 0:02:08,000
because they couldn't measure up.

38
0:02:08.956,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And I didn't know how to help them,

39
0:02:11.315,000 --> 0:02:13,000
because telling them that they weren't sick

40
0:02:13.949,000 --> 0:02:14,000
wasn't making them feel better.

41
0:02:16.841,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I wanted to find a way to normalize this transition,

42
0:02:21.145,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to explain that discomfort is not always the same thing as disease.

43
0:02:26.572,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So I set out to learn more about the psychology of motherhood.

44
0:02:30.654,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But there actually wasn't much in the medical textbooks,

45
0:02:33.552,000 --> 0:02:35,000
because doctors mostly write about disease.

46
0:02:36.725,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So I turned to anthropology.

47
0:02:39.148,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And it took me two years, but in an out-of-print essay

48
0:02:42.618,000 --> 0:02:45,000
written in 1973 by Dana Raphael,

49
0:02:46.612,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I finally found a helpful way to frame this conversation:

50
0:02:51.139,000 --> 0:02:52,000
matrescence.

51
0:02:53.672,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It's not a coincidence that "matrescence" sounds like "adolescence."

52
0:02:59.174,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Both are times when body morphing and hormone shifting

53
0:03:02.89,000 --> 0:03:05,000
lead to an upheaval in how a person feels emotionally

54
0:03:06.618,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and how they fit into the world.

55
0:03:08.891,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And like adolescence, matrescence is not a disease,

56
0:03:13.074,000 --> 0:03:15,000
but since it's not in the medical vocabulary,

57
0:03:15.92,000 --> 0:03:17,000
since doctors aren't educating people about it,

58
0:03:18.631,000 --> 0:03:2,000
it's being confused with a more serious condition

59
0:03:21.444,000 --> 0:03:22,000
called postpartum depression.

60
0:03:24.444,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I've been building on the anthropology literature

61
0:03:26.956,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and have been talking about matrescence with my patients

62
0:03:30.12,000 --> 0:03:32,000
using a concept called the "push and pull."

63
0:03:33.073,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Here's the pull part.

64
0:03:35.067,000 --> 0:03:39,000
As humans, our babies are uniquely dependent.

65
0:03:39.412,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Unlike other animals, our babies can't walk,

66
0:03:42.379,000 --> 0:03:43,000
they can't feed themselves,

67
0:03:43.99,000 --> 0:03:44,000
they're very hard to take care of.

68
0:03:45.897,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So evolution has helped us out with this hormone called oxytocin.

69
0:03:50.794,000 --> 0:03:52,000
It's released around childbirth

70
0:03:53.119,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and also during skin-to-skin touch,

71
0:03:55.619,000 --> 0:03:58,000
so it rises even if you didn't give birth to the baby.

72
0:03:59.668,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Oxytocin helps a human mother's brain zoom in, pulling her attention in,

73
0:04:05.161,000 --> 0:04:07,000
so that the baby is now at the center of her world.

74
0:04:08.567,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But at the same time, her mind is pushing away,

75
0:04:13.973,000 --> 0:04:17,000
because she remembers there are all these other parts to her identity --

76
0:04:19.434,000 --> 0:04:2,000
other relationships,

77
0:04:21.53,000 --> 0:04:22,000
her work,

78
0:04:22.859,000 --> 0:04:23,000
hobbies,

79
0:04:24.135,000 --> 0:04:26,000
a spiritual and intellectual life,

80
0:04:26.686,000 --> 0:04:28,000
not to mention physical needs:

81
0:04:28.978,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to sleep, to eat, to exercise,

82
0:04:32.366,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to have sex,

83
0:04:33.861,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to go to the bathroom,

84
0:04:35.299,000 --> 0:04:36,000
alone --

85
0:04:36.491,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:37.684,000 --> 0:04:38,000
if possible.

87
0:04:39.727,000 --> 0:04:43,000
This is the emotional tug-of-war of matrescence.

88
0:04:44.15,000 --> 0:04:47,000
This is the tension the women calling me were feeling.

89
0:04:47.589,000 --> 0:04:49,000
It's why they thought they were sick.

90
0:04:51.02,000 --> 0:04:55,000
If women understood the natural progression of matrescence,

91
0:04:55.985,000 --> 0:05:,000
if they knew that most people found it hard to live inside this push and pull,

92
0:05:01.652,000 --> 0:05:03,000
if they knew that under these circumstances,

93
0:05:04.601,000 --> 0:05:08,000
ambivalence was normal and nothing to be ashamed of,

94
0:05:09.175,000 --> 0:05:11,000
they would feel less alone,

95
0:05:11.229,000 --> 0:05:13,000
they would feel less stigmatized,

96
0:05:13.556,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and I think it would even reduce rates of postpartum depression.

97
0:05:18.332,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I'd love to study that one day.

98
0:05:21.451,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I'm a believer in talk therapy,

99
0:05:23.323,000 --> 0:05:25,000
so if we're going to change the way our culture understands

100
0:05:26.176,000 --> 0:05:27,000
this transition to motherhood,

101
0:05:27.994,000 --> 0:05:29,000
women need to be talking to each other,

102
0:05:30.182,000 --> 0:05:31,000
not just me.

103
0:05:32.313,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So mothers, talk about your matrescence

104
0:05:35.966,000 --> 0:05:37,000
with other mothers, with your friends,

105
0:05:38.637,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and, if you have one, with your partner,

106
0:05:40.89,000 --> 0:05:42,000
so that they can understand their own transition

107
0:05:43.801,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and better support you.

108
0:05:45.891,000 --> 0:05:48,000
But it's not just about protecting your relationship.

109
0:05:49.534,000 --> 0:05:52,000
When you preserve a separate part of your identity,

110
0:05:53.003,000 --> 0:05:56,000
you're also leaving room for your child to develop their own.

111
0:05:58.295,000 --> 0:06:01,000
When a baby is born, so is a mother,

112
0:06:02.169,000 --> 0:06:04,000
each unsteady in their own way.

113
0:06:05.659,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Matrescence is profound,

114
0:06:07.92,000 --> 0:06:08,000
but it's also hard,

115
0:06:09.712,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and that's what makes it human.

116
0:06:12.012,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Thank you.

117
0:06:13.191,000 --> 0:06:14,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.743,000 --> 0:00:16,000
In 2009, I bought a house in Detroit for 500 dollars.

2
0:00:17.891,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It had no windows, no plumbing, no electricity

3
0:00:21.676,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and it was filled with trash.

4
0:00:24.344,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The first floor held nearly 10,000 pounds of garbage,

5
0:00:28.321,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and that included the better part of a Dodge Caravan,

6
0:00:31.188,000 --> 0:00:33,000
cut into chunks with a reciprocating saw.

7
0:00:33.49,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:34.709,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I lived nearly two years without heat,

9
0:00:36.903,000 --> 0:00:39,000
woke up out of a dead sleep multiple times to gunshots,

10
0:00:40.411,000 --> 0:00:44,000
was attacked by a pack of wild dogs

11
0:00:44.471,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and ripped my kitchen cabinets from an abandoned school

12
0:00:48.171,000 --> 0:00:5,000
as they were actively tearing that school down.

13
0:00:52.626,000 --> 0:00:55,000
This, of course, is the Detroit that your hear about.

14
0:00:55.707,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Make no mistake, it's real.

15
0:00:58.929,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But there's another Detroit, too.

16
0:01:00.761,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Another Detroit that's more hopeful,

17
0:01:02.853,000 --> 0:01:03,000
more innovative,

18
0:01:04.168,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and may just provide some of the answers

19
0:01:06.343,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to cities struggling to reinvent themselves everywhere.

20
0:01:10.045,000 --> 0:01:14,000
These answers, however, do not necessarily adhere to conventional wisdom

21
0:01:14.901,000 --> 0:01:15,000
about good development.

22
0:01:17.472,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I think Detroit's real strength boils down to two words:

23
0:01:21.732,000 --> 0:01:23,000
radical neighborliness.

24
0:01:24.529,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And I wasn't able to see it myself until I lived there.

25
0:01:28.684,000 --> 0:01:29,000
About a decade ago,

26
0:01:29.859,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I moved to Detroit with no friends, no job and no money,

27
0:01:33.406,000 --> 0:01:36,000
at a time when it seemed like everyone else was moving out.

28
0:01:36.621,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Between 2000 and 2010,

29
0:01:39.376,000 --> 0:01:41,000
25 percent of the city's population left.

30
0:01:42.111,000 --> 0:01:45,000
This included about half of the elementary-aged children.

31
0:01:46.128,000 --> 0:01:48,000
This was after six decades of decline.

32
0:01:48.718,000 --> 0:01:52,000
A city built for almost two million was down to less than 800,000.

33
0:01:54.212,000 --> 0:01:57,000
What you usually don't hear is that people didn't go very far.

34
0:01:58.826,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The population of the Detroit metro area itself

35
0:02:02.149,000 --> 0:02:04,000
has largely remained steady since the '70s.

36
0:02:05.047,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Most people who left Detroit just went to the suburbs,

37
0:02:08.017,000 --> 0:02:11,000
while the 139 square miles of the city deteriorated,

38
0:02:12.804,000 --> 0:02:17,000
leaving some estimates as high as 40 square miles of abandoned land --

39
0:02:17.978,000 --> 0:02:18,000
about the size of San Francisco.

40
0:02:21.077,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Aside from platitudes such as the vague and agentless "deindustrialization,"

41
0:02:25.962,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Detroit's exodus can be summed up with two structures:

42
0:02:28.883,000 --> 0:02:29,000
freeways and walls.

43
0:02:31.612,000 --> 0:02:32,000
The freeways,

44
0:02:32.838,000 --> 0:02:34,000
coupled with massive governmental subsidies

45
0:02:35.419,000 --> 0:02:38,000
for the suburbs via infrastructure and home loans,

46
0:02:39.061,000 --> 0:02:41,000
allowed people to leave the city at will,

47
0:02:41.677,000 --> 0:02:44,000
taking with it tax base, jobs and education dollars.

48
0:02:46.222,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The walls made sure only certain people could leave.

49
0:02:50.111,000 --> 0:02:51,000
In multiple places,

50
0:02:51.285,000 --> 0:02:54,000
brick and concrete walls separate city and suburbs,

51
0:02:55.008,000 --> 0:02:56,000
white and black,

52
0:02:56.539,000 --> 0:02:58,000
running directly across municipal streets

53
0:02:58.96,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and through neighborhoods.

54
0:03:00.618,000 --> 0:03:04,000
They're mere physical manifestations of racist housing practices

55
0:03:04.659,000 --> 0:03:05,000
such as redlining,

56
0:03:05.842,000 --> 0:03:06,000
[Denying services to people of color]

57
0:03:07.643,000 --> 0:03:08,000
restrictive covenants

58
0:03:09.972,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and outright terror.

59
0:03:11.764,000 --> 0:03:15,000
In 1971, the Ku Klux Klan bombed 10 school buses

60
0:03:15.892,000 --> 0:03:17,000
rather than have them transport integrated students.

61
0:03:19.772,000 --> 0:03:23,000
All these have made Detroit the most racially segregated metro area

62
0:03:23.852,000 --> 0:03:24,000
in the United States.

63
0:03:26.735,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I grew up in a small town in Michigan,

64
0:03:28.701,000 --> 0:03:3,000
the son of a relatively blue-collar family.

65
0:03:31.294,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And after university, I wanted to do something --

66
0:03:33.841,000 --> 0:03:34,000
probably naïvely --

67
0:03:35.016,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to help.

68
0:03:36.594,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I didn't want to be one of the almost 50 percent of college graduates

69
0:03:40.055,000 --> 0:03:41,000
leaving the state at the time,

70
0:03:42.01,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and I thought I might use my fancy college education at home

71
0:03:45.453,000 --> 0:03:46,000
for something positive.

72
0:03:47.741,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I'd been reading this great American philosopher named Grace Lee Boggs

73
0:03:51.6,000 --> 0:03:52,000
who happened to live in Detroit,

74
0:03:53.379,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and she said something I can't forget.

75
0:03:56.847,000 --> 0:03:59,000
"The most radical thing that I ever did was to stay put."

76
0:04:02.355,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I thought buying a house might indelibly tie me to the city

77
0:04:06.284,000 --> 0:04:09,000
while acting as a physical protest to these walls and freeways.

78
0:04:10.084,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Because grants and loans weren't available to everyone,

79
0:04:12.68,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I decided I was going to do this without them

80
0:04:15.014,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and that I would wage my personal fight

81
0:04:16.921,000 --> 0:04:19,000
against the city that had loomed over my childhood with power tools.

82
0:04:21.284,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I eventually found an abandoned house in a neighborhood called Poletown.

83
0:04:25.73,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It looked like the apocalypse had descended.

84
0:04:28.585,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The neighborhood was prairie land.

85
0:04:30.292,000 --> 0:04:32,000
A huge, open expanse of waist-high grass

86
0:04:33.077,000 --> 0:04:36,000
cluttered only by a handful of crippled, abandoned structures

87
0:04:36.872,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and a few brave holdouts with well-kept homes.

88
0:04:40.96,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Just a 15-minute bike ride from the baseball stadium downtown,

89
0:04:45.111,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the neighborhood was positively rural.

90
0:04:48.921,000 --> 0:04:51,000
What houses were left looked like cardboard boxes left in the rain;

91
0:04:52.508,000 --> 0:04:54,000
two-story monstrosities with wide-open shells

92
0:04:55.525,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and melted porches.

93
0:04:57.348,000 --> 0:05:,000
One of the most striking things I remember were the rosebushes,

94
0:05:00.939,000 --> 0:05:03,000
forgotten and running wild over tumbled-down fences,

95
0:05:04.19,000 --> 0:05:05,000
no longer cared for by anyone.

96
0:05:07.565,000 --> 0:05:09,000
This was my house on the day I boarded it up

97
0:05:10.523,000 --> 0:05:12,000
to protect it from the elements and further decay.

98
0:05:13.344,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I eventually purchased it from the county in a live auction.

99
0:05:16.641,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I'd assumed the neighborhood was dead.

100
0:05:18.476,000 --> 0:05:2,000
That I was some kind of pioneer.

101
0:05:22.223,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.

102
0:05:24.554,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I was in no way a pioneer,

103
0:05:26.074,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and would come to understand how offensive that is.

104
0:05:29.844,000 --> 0:05:32,000
One of the first things I learned was to add my voice to the chorus,

105
0:05:33.606,000 --> 0:05:34,000
not overwrite what was already happening.

106
0:05:36.127,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Voice breaking) Because the neighborhood hadn't died.

107
0:05:38.723,000 --> 0:05:4,000
It had just transformed in a way that was difficult to see

108
0:05:41.527,000 --> 0:05:42,000
if you didn't live there.

109
0:05:43.274,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Poletown was home to an incredibly resourceful,

110
0:05:45.844,000 --> 0:05:48,000
incredibly intelligent and incredibly resilient community.

111
0:05:50.499,000 --> 0:05:54,000
It was there I first experienced the power of radical neighborliness.

112
0:05:55.985,000 --> 0:05:57,000
During the year I worked on my house before moving in,

113
0:05:58.533,000 --> 0:06:,000
I lived in a microcommunity inside Poletown,

114
0:06:01.025,000 --> 0:06:04,000
founded by a wild and virtuous farmer named Paul Weertz.

115
0:06:05.522,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Paul was a teacher in a Detroit public school

116
0:06:08.056,000 --> 0:06:09,000
for pregnant and parenting mothers,

117
0:06:09.859,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and his idea was to teach the young women to raise their children

118
0:06:12.952,000 --> 0:06:13,000
by first raising plants and animals.

119
0:06:15.785,000 --> 0:06:19,000
While the national average graduation rate for pregnant teens is about 40 percent,

120
0:06:20.075,000 --> 0:06:23,000
at Catherine Ferguson Academy it was often above 90,

121
0:06:23.284,000 --> 0:06:24,000
in part due to Paul's ingenuity.

122
0:06:25.716,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Paul brought much of this innovation to his block in Poletown,

123
0:06:28.734,000 --> 0:06:3,000
which he'd stewarded for more than 30 years,

124
0:06:31.316,000 --> 0:06:33,000
purchasing houses when they were abandoned,

125
0:06:33.828,000 --> 0:06:36,000
convincing his friends to move in and neighbors to stay

126
0:06:36.949,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and helping those who wanted to buy their own and fix them up.

127
0:06:40.886,000 --> 0:06:43,000
In a neighborhood where many blocks now only hold one or two houses,

128
0:06:44.807,000 --> 0:06:46,000
all the homes on Paul's block stand.

129
0:06:47.059,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It's an incredible testament to the power of community,

130
0:06:49.655,000 --> 0:06:5,000
to staying in one place

131
0:06:50.998,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and to taking ownership of one's own surroundings --

132
0:06:53.71,000 --> 0:06:54,000
of simply doing it yourself.

133
0:06:56.244,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It's the kind of place where black doctors live next to white hipsters

134
0:07:00.209,000 --> 0:07:01,000
next to immigrant mothers from Hungary

135
0:07:02.044,000 --> 0:07:04,000
or talented writers from the jungles of Belize,

136
0:07:04.861,000 --> 0:07:06,000
showing me Detroit wasn't just black and white,

137
0:07:07.12,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and diversity could flourish when it's encouraged.

138
0:07:10.466,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Each year, neighbors assemble to bale hay for the farm animals on the block,

139
0:07:14.786,000 --> 0:07:17,000
teaching me just how much a small group of people can get done

140
0:07:18.016,000 --> 0:07:19,000
when they work together,

141
0:07:19.731,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and the magnetism of fantastical yet practical ideas.

142
0:07:24.929,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Radical neighborliness is every house behind Paul's block burning down,

143
0:07:29.346,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and instead of letting it fill up with trash and despair,

144
0:07:32.602,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Paul and the surrounding community creating a giant circular garden

145
0:07:35.953,000 --> 0:07:38,000
ringed with dozens of fruit trees, beehives and garden plots

146
0:07:39.631,000 --> 0:07:4,000
for anyone that wants one,

147
0:07:41.457,000 --> 0:07:44,000
helping me see that our challenges can often be assets.

148
0:07:45.044,000 --> 0:07:49,000
It's where residents are experimenting with renewable energy and urban farming

149
0:07:49.394,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and offering their skills and discoveries to others,

150
0:07:52.291,000 --> 0:07:54,000
illustrating we don't necessarily have to beg the government

151
0:07:55.173,000 --> 0:07:56,000
to provide solutions.

152
0:07:56.45,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We can start ourselves.

153
0:07:58.344,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It's where, for months,

154
0:07:59.586,000 --> 0:08:01,000
one of my neighbors left her front door unlocked

155
0:08:02.023,000 --> 0:08:04,000
in one of the most violent and dangerous cities in America

156
0:08:04.815,000 --> 0:08:07,000
so I could have a shower whenever I needed to go to work,

157
0:08:07.841,000 --> 0:08:08,000
as I didn't yet have one.

158
0:08:10.416,000 --> 0:08:12,000
It was when it came time to raise the beam on my own house

159
0:08:13.155,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that holds the structure aloft --

160
0:08:14.774,000 --> 0:08:17,000
a beam that I cut out of an abandoned recycling factory down the street

161
0:08:18.201,000 --> 0:08:2,000
when not a single wall was left standing --

162
0:08:20.483,000 --> 0:08:23,000
a dozen residents of Poletown showed up to help lift it, Amish style.

163
0:08:25.97,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Radical neighborliness is a zygote that grows into a worldview

164
0:08:29.167,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that ends up in homes and communities rebuilt in ways that respect humanity

165
0:08:33.42,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and the environment.

166
0:08:34.796,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It's realizing we have the power to create the world anew together

167
0:08:38.167,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and to do it ourselves when our governments refuse.

168
0:08:42.015,000 --> 0:08:44,000
This is the Detroit that you don't hear much about.

169
0:08:45.271,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The Detroit between the ruin porn on one hand

170
0:08:48.589,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and the hipster coffee shops

171
0:08:50.356,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and billionaires saving the city on the other.

172
0:08:53.52,000 --> 0:08:54,000
There's a third way to rebuild,

173
0:08:55.199,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and it declines to make the same mistakes of the past.

174
0:08:59.285,000 --> 0:09:,000
While building my house,

175
0:09:00.46,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I found something I didn't know I was looking for --

176
0:09:02.917,000 --> 0:09:03,000
what a lot of millennials

177
0:09:04.146,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and people who are moving back to cities are looking for.

178
0:09:07.195,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Radical neighborliness is just another word for true community,

179
0:09:11.003,000 --> 0:09:13,000
the kind bound by memory and history,

180
0:09:13.164,000 --> 0:09:17,000
mutual trust and familiarity built over years and irreplaceable.

181
0:09:18.028,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And now, as you may have heard,

182
0:09:20.278,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Detroit is having a renaissance

183
0:09:22.478,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and pulling itself up from the ashes of despair,

184
0:09:25.287,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and the children and grandchildren of those who fled are returning,

185
0:09:28.929,000 --> 0:09:29,000
which is true.

186
0:09:31.198,000 --> 0:09:34,000
What isn't true is that this renaissance is reaching most Detroiters,

187
0:09:34.762,000 --> 0:09:36,000
or even more than a small fraction of them

188
0:09:36.806,000 --> 0:09:38,000
that don't live in the central areas of the city.

189
0:09:39.869,000 --> 0:09:42,000
These are the kind of people that have been in Detroit for generations

190
0:09:43.179,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and are mostly black.

191
0:09:44.891,000 --> 0:09:45,000
In 2016 alone,

192
0:09:46.387,000 --> 0:09:47,000
just last year,

193
0:09:48.965,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Voice breaking) one in six houses in Detroit

194
0:09:51.404,000 --> 0:09:52,000
had their water shut off.

195
0:09:55.057,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Excuse me.

196
0:09:58.622,000 --> 0:10:01,000
The United Nations has called this a violation of human rights.

197
0:10:03.134,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And since 2005, one in three houses --

198
0:10:06.566,000 --> 0:10:07,000
think about this, please --

199
0:10:09.824,000 --> 0:10:12,000
one in every three houses has been foreclosed in the city,

200
0:10:13.413,000 --> 0:10:16,000
representing a population about the size of Buffalo, New York.

201
0:10:17.649,000 --> 0:10:18,000
(Sniffles)

202
0:10:19.513,000 --> 0:10:23,000
One in three houses foreclosed is not a crisis of personal responsibility;

203
0:10:24.447,000 --> 0:10:25,000
it is systemic.

204
0:10:26.64,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Many Detroiters, myself included,

205
0:10:29.364,000 --> 0:10:32,000
are worried segregation is now returning to the city itself

206
0:10:33.077,000 --> 0:10:34,000
on the coattails of this renaissance.

207
0:10:38.142,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Ten years ago,

208
0:10:39.364,000 --> 0:10:41,000
it was not possible to go anywhere in Detroit

209
0:10:41.675,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and be in a crowd completely made of white people.

210
0:10:45.305,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Now, troublingly, that is possible.

211
0:10:48.94,000 --> 0:10:53,000
This is the price that we're paying for conventional economic resurgence.

212
0:10:54.79,000 --> 0:10:57,000
We're creating two Detroits, two classes of citizens,

213
0:10:58.525,000 --> 0:10:59,000
cracking the community apart.

214
0:11:00.725,000 --> 0:11:01,000
For all the money and subsidies,

215
0:11:02.397,000 --> 0:11:03,000
for all the streetlights installed,

216
0:11:04.088,000 --> 0:11:06,000
the dollars for new stadiums and slick advertisements

217
0:11:06.957,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and positive buzz,

218
0:11:08.389,000 --> 0:11:12,000
we're shutting off water to tens of thousands of people

219
0:11:12.876,000 --> 0:11:13,000
living right on the Great Lakes,

220
0:11:14.648,000 --> 0:11:15,000
the world's largest source of it.

221
0:11:17.636,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Separate has always meant unequal.

222
0:11:20.896,000 --> 0:11:22,000
This is a grave mistake for all of us.

223
0:11:24.132,000 --> 0:11:26,000
When economic development comes at the cost of community,

224
0:11:26.865,000 --> 0:11:28,000
it's not just those who have lost their homes

225
0:11:29.076,000 --> 0:11:3,000
or access to water who are harmed,

226
0:11:31.037,000 --> 0:11:34,000
but it breaks little pieces of our own humanity as well.

227
0:11:38.276,000 --> 0:11:39,000
None of us can truly be free,

228
0:11:40.216,000 --> 0:11:42,000
none of us can truly be comfortable,

229
0:11:42.376,000 --> 0:11:43,000
until our neighbors are, too.

230
0:11:44.888,000 --> 0:11:45,000
For those of us coming in,

231
0:11:46.738,000 --> 0:11:48,000
it means we must make sure we aren't inadvertently contributing

232
0:11:49.757,000 --> 0:11:51,000
to the destruction of community again,

233
0:11:51.99,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and to follow the lead

234
0:11:53.165,000 --> 0:11:55,000
of those who have been working on these problems for years.

235
0:11:56.18,000 --> 0:12:,000
In Detroit, that means average citizens deputizing themselves

236
0:12:00.206,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to create water stations and deliveries for those who have lost access to it.

237
0:12:04.366,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Or clergy and teachers engaging in civil disobedience

238
0:12:07.149,000 --> 0:12:08,000
to block water shutoff trucks.

239
0:12:09.42,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It's organizations buying back foreclosed homes for their inhabitants

240
0:12:13.31,000 --> 0:12:16,000
or fighting misinformation on forced sales through social media

241
0:12:16.676,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and volunteer-run hotlines.

242
0:12:19.231,000 --> 0:12:21,000
For me, it means helping others to raise the beams

243
0:12:21.889,000 --> 0:12:23,000
on their own formerly abandoned houses,

244
0:12:24.131,000 --> 0:12:26,000
or helping to educate those with privilege,

245
0:12:26.342,000 --> 0:12:27,000
now increasingly moving into cities,

246
0:12:28.35,000 --> 0:12:3,000
how we might come in and support

247
0:12:30.503,000 --> 0:12:32,000
rather than stress existing communities.

248
0:12:32.802,000 --> 0:12:34,000
It's chipping in when a small group of neighbors decides

249
0:12:35.696,000 --> 0:12:36,000
to buy back a foreclosed home

250
0:12:37.517,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and return the deeds to the occupants.

251
0:12:40.352,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And for you, for all of us,

252
0:12:42.981,000 --> 0:12:45,000
it means finding a role to play in our own communities.

253
0:12:46.777,000 --> 0:12:5,000
It means living your life as a reflection of the world that you want to live in.

254
0:12:51.332,000 --> 0:12:54,000
It means trusting those who know the problems best --

255
0:12:54.773,000 --> 0:12:55,000
the people who live them --

256
0:12:56.325,000 --> 0:12:57,000
with solutions.

257
0:12:58.919,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I know a third way is possible because I have lived it.

258
0:13:02.845,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I live it right now

259
0:13:07.222,000 --> 0:13:08,000
in a neighborhood called Poletown

260
0:13:08.818,000 --> 0:13:1,000
in one of the most maligned cities in the world.

261
0:13:11.64,000 --> 0:13:12,000
If we can do it in Detroit,

262
0:13:13.203,000 --> 0:13:14,000
you can do it wherever you're from, too.

263
0:13:16.094,000 --> 0:13:17,000
What I've learned over the last decade,

264
0:13:18.03,000 --> 0:13:19,000
building my house,

265
0:13:19.957,000 --> 0:13:21,000
wasn't so much about wiring or plumbing or carpentry --

266
0:13:22.968,000 --> 0:13:24,000
although I did learn these things --

267
0:13:25.646,000 --> 0:13:27,000
is that true change, real change,

268
0:13:28.665,000 --> 0:13:29,000
starts first with community,

269
0:13:30.496,000 --> 0:13:33,000
with a radical sense of what it means to be a neighbor.

270
0:13:34.681,000 --> 0:13:36,000
It turned at least one abandoned house into a home.

271
0:13:38.234,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Thank you.

272
0:13:39.409,000 --> 0:13:42,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.413,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It was a Sunday afternoon back in April of this year.

2
0:00:17.651,000 --> 0:00:18,000
My phone was ringing,

3
0:00:19.524,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I picked it up.

4
0:00:21.5,000 --> 0:00:23,000
The voice said, "It's Rebecca.

5
0:00:24.847,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I'm just calling to invite you

6
0:00:27.419,000 --> 0:00:28,000
to my funeral."

7
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I said, "Rebecca, what are you talking about?"

8
0:00:33.593,000 --> 0:00:38,000
She said, "Joy, as my friend, you have to let me go.

9
0:00:39.235,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It's my time."

10
0:00:41.854,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The next day, she was dead.

11
0:00:46.021,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Rebecca was 31 years old when she died.

12
0:00:49.657,000 --> 0:00:52,000
She had an eight-year struggle with breast cancer.

13
0:00:53.53,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It came back three times.

14
0:00:55.879,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I failed her.

15
0:00:58.642,000 --> 0:01:,000
The scientific community failed her.

16
0:01:01.579,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And the medical community failed her.

17
0:01:05.254,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And she's not the only one.

18
0:01:07.674,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Every five seconds,

19
0:01:09.593,000 --> 0:01:11,000
someone dies of cancer.

20
0:01:13.371,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Today, we medical researchers are committed

21
0:01:17.683,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to having Rebecca and people like her

22
0:01:20.969,000 --> 0:01:22,000
be one of the last patients that we fail.

23
0:01:24.569,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The US government alone has spent over 100 billion on cancer research

24
0:01:30.637,000 --> 0:01:31,000
since the 1970s,

25
0:01:32.281,000 --> 0:01:35,000
with limited progress in regards to patient survival,

26
0:01:36.236,000 --> 0:01:39,000
especially for certain types of very aggressive cancers.

27
0:01:40.95,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So we need a change because, clearly,

28
0:01:43.179,000 --> 0:01:47,000
what we've been doing so far has not been working.

29
0:01:48.679,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And what we do in medicine is to send out firefighters,

30
0:01:51.99,000 --> 0:01:53,000
because cancer is like a big fire.

31
0:01:54.784,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And these firefighters are the cancer drugs.

32
0:01:58.228,000 --> 0:02:02,000
But we're sending them out without a fire truck --

33
0:02:02.315,000 --> 0:02:05,000
so without transportation, without ladders

34
0:02:05.506,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and without emergency equipment.

35
0:02:08.657,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And over 99 percent of these firefighters never make it to the fire.

36
0:02:15.553,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Over 99 percent of cancer drugs never make it to the tumor

37
0:02:20.606,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because they lack transportation and tools

38
0:02:24.86,000 --> 0:02:27,000
to take them to the location they're aiming for.

39
0:02:29.999,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Turns out, it really is all about location, location, location.

40
0:02:33.963,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:35.11,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So we need a fire truck to get to the right location.

42
0:02:40.403,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And I'm here to tell you that nanoparticles are the fire trucks.

43
0:02:45.323,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We can load cancer drugs inside nanoparticles,

44
0:02:49.429,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and nanoparticles can function as the carrier

45
0:02:53.103,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and necessary equipment

46
0:02:55.008,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to bring the cancer drugs to the heart of the tumor.

47
0:03:00.315,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So what are nanoparticles,

48
0:03:01.841,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and what does it really mean to be nano-sized?

49
0:03:05.664,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Well, there are many different types of nanoparticles

50
0:03:09.061,000 --> 0:03:1,000
made out of various materials,

51
0:03:10.76,000 --> 0:03:13,000
such as metal-based nanoparticles

52
0:03:14.157,000 --> 0:03:16,000
or fat-based nanoparticles.

53
0:03:17.309,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But to really illustrate what it means to be nano-sized,

54
0:03:20.904,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I took one of my hair strands

55
0:03:23.682,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and placed it under the microscope.

56
0:03:26.094,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Now, I have very thin hair,

57
0:03:27.586,000 --> 0:03:32,000
so my hair is approximately 40,000 nanometers in diameter.

58
0:03:33.283,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So this means, if we take 400 of our nanoparticles

59
0:03:36.292,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and we stack them on top of each other,

60
0:03:39.284,000 --> 0:03:42,000
we get the thickness of a single hair strand.

61
0:03:43.577,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I lead a nanoparticle laboratory to fight cancer and other diseases

62
0:03:49.196,000 --> 0:03:51,000
at Mayo Clinic here in Jacksonville.

63
0:03:52.228,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And at Mayo Clinic,

64
0:03:53.418,000 --> 0:03:56,000
we really have the tools to make a difference for patients,

65
0:03:57.145,000 --> 0:04:01,000
thanks to the generous donations and grants to fund our research.

66
0:04:03.574,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And so, how do these nanoparticles manage to transport cancer drugs

67
0:04:08.005,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to the tumor?

68
0:04:09.807,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Well, they have an extensive toolbox.

69
0:04:13.982,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Cancer drugs without nanoparticles are quickly washed out of the body

70
0:04:18.692,000 --> 0:04:19,000
through the kidneys

71
0:04:19.881,000 --> 0:04:2,000
because they're so small.

72
0:04:21.85,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So it's like water going through a sieve.

73
0:04:24.628,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And so they don't really have time to reach the tumor.

74
0:04:27.794,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Here we see an illustration of this.

75
0:04:30.046,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We have the firefighters, the cancer drugs.

76
0:04:32.276,000 --> 0:04:34,000
They're circulating in the blood,

77
0:04:34.411,000 --> 0:04:36,000
but they're quickly washed out of the body

78
0:04:36.458,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and they don't really end up inside the tumor.

79
0:04:40.45,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But if we put these cancer drugs inside nanoparticles,

80
0:04:45.101,000 --> 0:04:47,000
they will not get washed out by the body

81
0:04:47.212,000 --> 0:04:49,000
because the nanoparticles are too big.

82
0:04:49.553,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And they will continue to circulate in the blood,

83
0:04:52.755,000 --> 0:04:54,000
giving them more time to find the tumor.

84
0:04:56.252,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And here we see the cancer drug, the firefighters,

85
0:04:58.847,000 --> 0:05:01,000
inside the fire truck, the nanoparticles.

86
0:05:02.313,000 --> 0:05:03,000
They're circulating in the blood,

87
0:05:04.012,000 --> 0:05:05,000
they don't get washed out

88
0:05:05.972,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and they actually end up reaching the tumor.

89
0:05:11.48,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And so what other tools do nanoparticles have?

90
0:05:14.785,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Well, they can protect cancer drugs from getting destroyed inside the body.

91
0:05:20.293,000 --> 0:05:23,000
There are certain very important but sensitive drugs

92
0:05:24.077,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that are easily degraded by enzymes in the blood.

93
0:05:27.339,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So unless they have this nanoparticle protection,

94
0:05:30.649,000 --> 0:05:32,000
they will not be able to function.

95
0:05:34.362,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Another nanoparticle tool are these surface extensions

96
0:05:37.387,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that are like tiny hands with fingers that grab on to the tumor

97
0:05:42.53,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and fit exactly onto it,

98
0:05:44.141,000 --> 0:05:46,000
so that when the nanoparticles are circulating,

99
0:05:46.45,000 --> 0:05:48,000
they can attach onto the cancer cells,

100
0:05:49.03,000 --> 0:05:52,000
buying the cancer drugs more time to do their job.

101
0:05:53.887,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And these are just some of the many tools that nanoparticles can have.

102
0:05:58.585,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And today,

103
0:05:59.784,000 --> 0:06:03,000
we have more than 10 clinically approved nanoparticles for cancer

104
0:06:03.998,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that are given to patients all over the world.

105
0:06:08.069,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Yet, we have patients, like Rebecca, who die.

106
0:06:13.362,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So what are the major challenges and limitations

107
0:06:17.299,000 --> 0:06:19,000
with currently approved nanoparticles?

108
0:06:21.501,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Well, a major challenge is the liver,

109
0:06:24.962,000 --> 0:06:27,000
because the liver is the body's filtration system,

110
0:06:28.057,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and the liver recognizes and destroys foreign objects,

111
0:06:31.679,000 --> 0:06:35,000
such as viruses, bacteria and also nanoparticles.

112
0:06:36.231,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And the immune cells in the liver eat the nanoparticles,

113
0:06:39.604,000 --> 0:06:42,000
preventing them from reaching the tumor.

114
0:06:45.367,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And here we see an illustration where the kidney is no longer a problem,

115
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but these fire trucks, the nanoparticles,

116
0:06:51.604,000 --> 0:06:52,000
get stuck in the liver

117
0:06:53.291,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and, actually, less of them end up reaching the tumor.

118
0:06:59.164,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So a future strategy to improve nanoparticles

119
0:07:02.486,000 --> 0:07:06,000
is to temporarily disarm the immune cells in the liver.

120
0:07:07.399,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So how do we disarm these cells?

121
0:07:09.883,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Well, we looked at drugs that were already clinically approved

122
0:07:13.539,000 --> 0:07:14,000
for other indications

123
0:07:15.419,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to see if any of them could stop the immune cells

124
0:07:18.22,000 --> 0:07:2,000
from eating the nanoparticles.

125
0:07:21.776,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And unexpectedly, in one of our preclinical studies,

126
0:07:25.966,000 --> 0:07:29,000
we found that a 70-year-old malaria drug

127
0:07:30.128,000 --> 0:07:34,000
was able to stop the immune cells from internalizing the nanoparticles

128
0:07:34.982,000 --> 0:07:36,000
so that they could escape the liver

129
0:07:37.236,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and continue their journey to their goal, the tumor.

130
0:07:42.538,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And here we see the illustration of blocking the liver.

131
0:07:45.713,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The nanoparticles don't go there,

132
0:07:47.57,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and they instead end up in the tumor.

133
0:07:51.141,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So, sometimes, unexpected connections are made in science

134
0:07:55.855,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that lead to new solutions.

135
0:07:59.919,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Another strategy for preventing nanoparticles

136
0:08:03.654,000 --> 0:08:05,000
from getting stuck in the liver

137
0:08:06.22,000 --> 0:08:09,000
is to use the body's own nanoparticles.

138
0:08:09.474,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Yes -- surprise, surprise.

139
0:08:10.966,000 --> 0:08:15,000
You, and you and you, and all of us have a lot of nanoparticles

140
0:08:16.097,000 --> 0:08:17,000
circulating in our bodies.

141
0:08:18.434,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And because they're part of our bodies,

142
0:08:21.093,000 --> 0:08:25,000
the liver is less likely to label them as foreign.

143
0:08:26.998,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And these biological nanoparticles can be found in the saliva,

144
0:08:30.736,000 --> 0:08:33,000
in the blood, in the urine, in pancreatic juice.

145
0:08:33.982,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And we can collect them from the body

146
0:08:35.999,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and use them as fire trucks for cancer drugs.

147
0:08:40.855,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And in this case,

148
0:08:42.117,000 --> 0:08:45,000
the immune cells in the liver are less likely to eat

149
0:08:45.34,000 --> 0:08:46,000
the biological nanoparticles.

150
0:08:47.691,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So we're using a Trojan-horse-based concept

151
0:08:50.643,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to fool the liver.

152
0:08:52.921,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And here we see the biological nanoparticles

153
0:08:55.302,000 --> 0:08:56,000
circulating in the blood.

154
0:08:56.905,000 --> 0:08:58,000
They don't get recognized by the liver,

155
0:08:59.325,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and they end up in the tumor.

156
0:09:02.413,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And in the future,

157
0:09:03.873,000 --> 0:09:06,000
we want to exploit nature's own nanoparticles

158
0:09:07.42,000 --> 0:09:09,000
for cancer drug delivery,

159
0:09:10.387,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to reduce side effects and save lives

160
0:09:13.347,000 --> 0:09:17,000
by preventing the cancer drugs from being in the wrong location.

161
0:09:19.761,000 --> 0:09:21,000
However, a major problem has been:

162
0:09:21.976,000 --> 0:09:26,000
How do we isolate these biological nanoparticles in large quantities

163
0:09:27.937,000 --> 0:09:28,000
without damaging them?

164
0:09:30.915,000 --> 0:09:32,000
My lab has developed an efficient method for doing this.

165
0:09:33.811,000 --> 0:09:37,000
We can process large quantities of liquids from the body

166
0:09:38.272,000 --> 0:09:42,000
to produce a highly concentrated, high-quality formulation

167
0:09:43.081,000 --> 0:09:44,000
of biological nanoparticles.

168
0:09:46.136,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And these nanoparticles are not yet in clinical use,

169
0:09:50.303,000 --> 0:09:53,000
because it takes an average of 12 years

170
0:09:53.339,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to get something from the lab

171
0:09:55.799,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to your medicine cabinet.

172
0:10:00.093,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And this is the type of challenge that requires teamwork

173
0:10:04.718,000 --> 0:10:07,000
from scientists and physicians,

174
0:10:07.982,000 --> 0:10:09,000
who dedicate their lives to this battle.

175
0:10:12.149,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And we keep going, thanks to inspiration from patients.

176
0:10:17.532,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And I believe that if we keep working on these nanomedicines,

177
0:10:21.715,000 --> 0:10:24,000
we will be able to reduce harm to healthy organs,

178
0:10:25.561,000 --> 0:10:26,000
improve quality of life

179
0:10:27.331,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and save future patients.

180
0:10:32.363,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I like to imagine

181
0:10:34.617,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that if these treatments had been available for Rebecca,

182
0:10:39.769,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that call from her

183
0:10:41.785,000 --> 0:10:42,000
could have been an invitation

184
0:10:44.516,000 --> 0:10:45,000
not to her funeral,

185
0:10:46.206,000 --> 0:10:47,000
but her wedding.

186
0:10:47.396,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Thank you.

187
0:10:48.785,000 --> 0:10:51,000

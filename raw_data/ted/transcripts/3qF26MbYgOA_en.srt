1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:31,000
If you take 10,000 people at random, 9,999 have something in common:

2
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:36,000
their interests in business lie on or near the Earth's surface.

3
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:4,000
The odd one out is an astronomer, and I am one of that strange breed.

4
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:46,000
My talk will be in two parts. I'll talk first as an astronomer,

6
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and then as a worried member of the human race.

7
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But let's start off by remembering that Darwin showed

8
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:59,000
how we're the outcome of four billion years of evolution.

9
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology

10
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:05,000
is to go back before Darwin's simple beginning,

11
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to set our Earth in a cosmic context.

12
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And let me just run through a few slides.

13
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:16,000
This was the impact that happened last week on a comet.

14
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:19,000
If they'd sent a nuke, it would have been rather more spectacular

15
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:21,000
than what actually happened last Monday.

16
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So that's another project for NASA.

17
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:29,000
That's Mars from the European Mars Express, and at New Year.

18
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:34,000
This artist's impression turned into reality

19
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:38,000
when a parachute landed on Titan, Saturn's giant moon.

20
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It landed on the surface. This is pictures taken on the way down.

21
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:43,000
That looks like a coastline.

22
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It is indeed, but the ocean is liquid methane --

23
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the temperature minus 170 degrees centigrade.

24
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:53,000
If we go beyond our solar system,

25
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:57,000
we've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light.

26
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it.

27
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And we can see places where stars are forming,

28
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:08,000
like the Eagle Nebula. We see stars dying.

29
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:11,000
In six billion years, the sun will look like that.

30
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion,

31
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
leaving remnants like that.

32
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:21,000
On a still bigger scale, we see entire galaxies of stars.

33
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled.

34
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And to the cosmologist,

35
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
these galaxies are just the atoms, as it were, of the large-scale universe.

36
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
This picture shows a patch of sky

37
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:38,000
so small that it would take about 100 patches like it

38
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:4,000
to cover the full moon in the sky.

39
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Through a small telescope, this would look quite blank,

40
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:47,000
but you see here hundreds of little, faint smudges.

41
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Each is a galaxy, fully like ours or Andromeda,

42
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
which looks so small and faint because its light

43
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:56,000
has taken 10 billion light-years to get to us.

44
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The stars in those galaxies probably don't have planets around them.

45
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:05,000
There's scant chance of life there -- that's because there's been no time

46
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:11,000
for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron,

47
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the building blocks of planets and of life.

48
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:2,000
We believe that all of this emerged from a Big Bang --

49
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:25,000
a hot, dense state. So how did that amorphous Big Bang

50
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:27,000
turn into our complex cosmos?

51
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I'm going to show you a movie simulation

52
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:32,000
16 powers of 10 faster than real time,

53
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:36,000
which shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out.

54
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But you see, as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom,

55
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:43,000
you will see structures evolve as gravity feeds

56
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:47,000
on small, dense irregularities, and structures develop.

57
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And we'll end up after 13 billion years

58
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:53,000
with something looking rather like our own universe.

59
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And we compare simulated universes like that --

60
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk --

61
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:05,000
with what we actually see in the sky.

62
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Well, we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the Big Bang,

63
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but we still don't know what banged and why it banged.

64
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:18,000
That's a challenge for 21st-century science.

65
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:23,000
If my research group had a logo, it would be this picture here:

66
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:27,000
an ouroboros, where you see the micro-world on the left --

67
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:31,000
the world of the quantum -- and on the right

68
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:36,000
the large-scale universe of planets, stars and galaxies.

69
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:38,000
We know our universes are united though --

70
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:4,000
links between left and right.

71
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
The everyday world is determined by atoms,

72
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:44,000
how they stick together to make molecules.

73
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together.

74
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And, as we've learned in the last few years, galaxies are held together

75
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:56,000
by the gravitational pull of so-called dark matter:

76
0:04:56,000 --> 0:05:01,000
particles in huge swarms, far smaller even than atomic nuclei.

77
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But we'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top.

78
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:11,000
The micro-world of the quantum is understood.

79
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:15,000
On the right hand side, gravity holds sway. Einstein explained that.

80
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But the unfinished business for 21st-century science

81
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:21,000
is to link together cosmos and micro-world

82
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:25,000
with a unified theory -- symbolized, as it were, gastronomically

83
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:27,000
at the top of that picture. (Laughter)

84
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And until we have that synthesis,

85
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:32,000
we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe

86
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:35,000
because when our universe was itself the size of an atom,

87
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:37,000
quantum effects could shake everything.

88
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small,

89
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:44,000
which we don't yet have.

90
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:47,000
One idea, incidentally --

91
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and I had this hazard sign to say I'm going to speculate from now on --

92
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:54,000
is that our Big Bang was not the only one.

93
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:58,000
One idea is that our three-dimensional universe

94
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:,000
may be embedded in a high-dimensional space,

95
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:03,000
just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper.

96
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:05,000
You can imagine ants on one of them

97
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:07,000
thinking it's a two-dimensional universe,

98
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:09,000
not being aware of another population of ants on the other.

99
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours,

100
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but we're not aware of it because that millimeter

101
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
is measured in some fourth spatial dimension,

102
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and we're imprisoned in our three.

103
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality

104
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:27,000
than what we've normally called our universe --

105
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:3,000
the aftermath of our Big Bang. And here's another picture.

106
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Bottom right depicts our universe,

107
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
which on the horizon is not beyond that,

108
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:39,000
but even that is just one bubble, as it were, in some vaster reality.

109
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Many people suspect that just as we've gone from believing

110
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:46,000
in one solar system to zillions of solar systems,

111
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:48,000
one galaxy to many galaxies,

112
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:52,000
we have to go to many Big Bangs from one Big Bang,

113
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:54,000
perhaps these many Big Bangs displaying

114
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:56,000
an immense variety of properties.

115
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Well, let's go back to this picture.

116
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:,000
There's one challenge symbolized at the top,

117
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but there's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom.

118
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:08,000
You want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small,

119
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but we want to understand the very complex.

120
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And the most complex things are ourselves,

121
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:15,000
midway between atoms and stars.

122
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of.

123
0:07:17,000 --> 0:07:22,000
We depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure.

124
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We clearly have to be large, compared to atoms,

125
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to have layer upon layer of complex structure.

126
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We clearly have to be small, compared to stars and planets --

127
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:35,000
otherwise we'd be crushed by gravity. And in fact, we are midway.

128
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It would take as many human bodies to make up the sun

129
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:39,000
as there are atoms in each of us.

130
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:41,000
The geometric mean of the mass of a proton

131
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms,

132
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:47,000
within a factor of two of the mass of each person here.

133
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Well, most of you anyway.

134
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:53,000
The science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all,

135
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:55,000
greater than that of the very small on the left

136
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and the very large on the right.

137
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:,000
And it's this science,

138
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:04,000
which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world,

139
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:07,000
but also transforming our world faster than ever.

140
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And more than that, it's engendering new kinds of change.

141
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And I now move on to the second part of my talk,

142
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and the book "Our Final Century" was mentioned.

143
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:25,000
If I was not a self-effacing Brit, I would mention the book myself,

144
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and I would add that it's available in paperback.

145
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Laughter)

146
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And in America it was called "Our Final Hour"

147
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:36,000
because Americans like instant gratification.

148
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Laughter)

149
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:41,000
But my theme is that in this century,

150
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:44,000
not only has science changed the world faster than ever,

151
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but in new and different ways.

152
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Targeted drugs, genetic modification, artificial intelligence,

153
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:53,000
perhaps even implants into our brains,

154
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:56,000
may change human beings themselves. And human beings,

155
0:08:56,000 --> 0:09:,000
their physique and character, has not changed for thousands of years.

156
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It may change this century.

157
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
It's new in our history.

158
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And the human impact on the global environment -- greenhouse warming,

159
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:1,000
mass extinctions and so forth -- is unprecedented, too.

160
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And so, this makes this coming century a challenge.

161
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Bio- and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign

162
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:21,000
in that they offer marvelous prospects,

163
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:24,000
while, nonetheless, reducing pressure on energy and resources.

164
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:27,000
But they will have a dark side.

165
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:32,000
In our interconnected world, novel technology could empower

166
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:34,000
just one fanatic,

167
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:38,000
or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses,

168
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to trigger some kind on disaster.

169
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Indeed, catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure --

170
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:46,000
error rather than terror.

171
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable

172
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:54,000
when the downside could be of global consequence.

173
0:09:56,000 --> 0:10:,000
In fact, some years ago, Bill Joy wrote an article

174
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:04,000
expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over, etc.

175
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I don't go along with all that,

176
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:07,000
but it's interesting that he had a simple solution.

177
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:1,000
It was what he called "fine-grained relinquishment."

178
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:13,000
He wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science

179
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and keep the good bits. Now, that's absurdly naive for two reasons.

180
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:21,000
First, any scientific discovery has benign consequences

181
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:23,000
as well as dangerous ones.

182
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And also, when a scientist makes a discovery,

183
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be.

184
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And so what this means is that we have to accept the risks

185
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:39,000
if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science.

186
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We have to accept that there will be hazards.

187
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And I think we have to go back to what happened in the post-War era,

188
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:51,000
post-World War II, when the nuclear scientists

189
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:53,000
who'd been involved in making the atomic bomb,

190
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:57,000
in many cases were concerned that they should do all they could

191
0:10:57,000 --> 0:10:59,000
to alert the world to the dangers.

192
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And they were inspired not by the young Einstein,

193
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:08,000
who did the great work in relativity, but by the old Einstein,

194
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:11,000
the icon of poster and t-shirt,

195
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:15,000
who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws.

196
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:18,000
He was premature. But he was a moral compass --

197
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:23,000
an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control.

198
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And perhaps the greatest living person

199
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:28,000
is someone I'm privileged to know, Joe Rothblatt.

200
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Equally untidy office there, as you can see.

201
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:35,000
He's 96 years old, and he founded the Pugwash movement.

202
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:37,000
He persuaded Einstein, as his last act,

203
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:4,000
to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell.

204
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And he sets an example of the concerned scientist.

205
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And I think to harness science optimally,

206
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:51,000
to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed,

207
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:56,000
we need latter-day counterparts of people like Joseph Rothblatt.

208
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:58,000
We need not just campaigning physicists,

209
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:,000
but we need biologists, computer experts

210
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and environmentalists as well.

211
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And I think academics and independent entrepreneurs

212
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:08,000
have a special obligation because they have more freedom

213
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:1,000
than those in government service,

214
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:13,000
or company employees subject to commercial pressure.

215
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I wrote my book, "Our Final Century," as a scientist,

216
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:21,000
just a general scientist. But there's one respect, I think,

217
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:25,000
in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective,

218
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future.

219
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:32,000
The stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past

220
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:35,000
are now part of common culture --

221
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:38,000
outside the American Bible Belt, anyway --

222
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:39,000
(Laughter)

223
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:43,000
but most people, even those who are familiar with evolution,

224
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:46,000
aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead.

225
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:5,000
The sun has been shining for four and a half billion years,

226
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:54,000
but it'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out.

227
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:59,000
On that schematic picture, a sort of time-lapse picture, we're halfway.

228
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And it'll be another six billion before that happens,

229
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and any remaining life on Earth is vaporized.

230
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:13,000
There's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there,

231
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:15,000
experiencing the sun's demise,

232
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:18,000
but any life and intelligence that exists then

233
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:22,000
will be as different from us as we are from bacteria.

234
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:24,000
The unfolding of intelligence and complexity

235
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:29,000
still has immensely far to go, here on Earth and probably far beyond.

236
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity

237
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
in our Earth and beyond.

238
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:4,000
If you represent the Earth's lifetime by a single year,

239
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:43,000
say from January when it was made to December,

240
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:48,000
the 21st-century would be a quarter of a second in June --

241
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:51,000
a tiny fraction of the year.

242
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:56,000
But even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective,

243
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:58,000
our century is very, very special,

244
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:03,000
the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet.

245
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:07,000
As I should have shown this earlier,

246
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:1,000
it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun;

247
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:13,000
it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria.

248
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:18,000
When Einstein died in 1955,

249
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:21,000
one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon

250
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:23,000
by Herblock in the Washington Post.

251
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:26,000
The plaque reads, "Albert Einstein lived here."

252
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And I'd like to end with a vignette, as it were, inspired by this image.

253
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We've been familiar for 40 years with this image:

254
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:4,000
the fragile beauty of land, ocean and clouds,

255
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:42,000
contrasted with the sterile moonscape

256
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:45,000
on which the astronauts left their footprints.

257
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:5,000
But let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot

258
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:54,000
in the cosmos from afar, not just for 40 years,

259
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:58,000
but for the entire 4.5 billion-year history of our Earth.

260
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:01,000
What would they have seen?

261
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Over nearly all that immense time,

262
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Earth's appearance would have changed very gradually.

263
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:08,000
The only abrupt worldwide change

264
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:14,000
would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions.

265
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Apart from those brief traumas, nothing happens suddenly.

266
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:21,000
The continental landmasses drifted around.

267
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Ice cover waxed and waned.

268
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Successions of new species emerged, evolved and became extinct.

269
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:31,000
But in just a tiny sliver of the Earth's history,

270
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:34,000
the last one-millionth part, a few thousand years,

271
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:38,000
the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before.

272
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:41,000
This signaled the start of agriculture.

273
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Change has accelerated as human populations rose.

274
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Then other things happened even more abruptly.

275
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Within just 50 years --

276
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:53,000
that's one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth's age --

277
0:15:53,000 --> 0:15:57,000
the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise,

278
0:15:57,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and ominously fast.

279
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:01,000
The planet became an intense emitter of radio waves --

280
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:05,000
the total output from all TV and cell phones

281
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:08,000
and radar transmissions. And something else happened.

282
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Metallic objects -- albeit very small ones, a few tons at most --

283
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:16,000
escaped into orbit around the Earth.

284
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Some journeyed to the moons and planets.

285
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:2,000
A race of advanced extraterrestrials

286
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:23,000
watching our solar system from afar

287
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:28,000
could confidently predict Earth's final doom in another six billion years.

288
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:32,000
But could they have predicted this unprecedented spike

289
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:35,000
less than halfway through the Earth's life?

290
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:37,000
These human-induced alterations

291
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:41,000
occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime

292
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and seemingly occurring with runaway speed?

293
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:46,000
If they continued their vigil,

294
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:48,000
what might these hypothetical aliens witness

295
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:5,000
in the next hundred years?

296
0:16:51,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Will some spasm foreclose Earth's future?

297
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Or will the biosphere stabilize?

298
0:16:57,000 --> 0:17:,000
Or will some of the metallic objects launched from the Earth

299
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:04,000
spawn new oases, a post-human life elsewhere?

300
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:07,000
The science done by the young Einstein will continue

301
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:12,000
as long as our civilization, but for civilization to survive,

302
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:14,000
we'll need the wisdom of the old Einstein --

303
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:16,000
humane, global and farseeing.

304
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
And whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century

305
0:17:21,000 --> 0:17:27,000
will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the Earth,

306
0:17:27,000 --> 0:17:29,000
far beyond the Earth as depicted here.

307
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:31,000
Thank you very much.

308
0:17:31,000 --> 0:17:34,000
(Applause)

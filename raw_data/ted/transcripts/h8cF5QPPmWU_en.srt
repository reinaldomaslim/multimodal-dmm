1
0:00:12.747,000 --> 0:00:14,000
The year is 1800.

2
0:00:15.07,000 --> 0:00:18,000
A curious little invention is being talked about.

3
0:00:18.126,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It's called a microscope.

4
0:00:21.207,000 --> 0:00:22,000
What it allows you to do

5
0:00:22.986,000 --> 0:00:24,000
is see tiny little lifeforms

6
0:00:25.628,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that are invisible to the naked eye.

7
0:00:28.115,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Soon comes the medical discovery

8
0:00:30.143,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that many of these lifeforms are actually causes

9
0:00:33.228,000 --> 0:00:35,000
of terrible human diseases.

10
0:00:35.419,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Imagine what happened to the society

11
0:00:38.204,000 --> 0:00:39,000
when they realized

12
0:00:40.192,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that an English mom in her teacup

13
0:00:43.008,000 --> 0:00:46,000
actually was drinking a monster soup,

14
0:00:46.144,000 --> 0:00:49,000
not very far from here. This is from London.

15
0:00:49.293,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Fast forward 200 years.

16
0:00:52.135,000 --> 0:00:54,000
We still have this monster soup around,

17
0:00:54.267,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and it's taken hold in the developing countries

18
0:00:57.122,000 --> 0:00:59,000
around the tropical belt.

19
0:00:59.538,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Just for malaria itself,

20
0:01:02.101,000 --> 0:01:04,000
there are a million deaths a year,

21
0:01:04.546,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and more than a billion people

22
0:01:06.292,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that need to be tested because they are at risk

23
0:01:08.94,000 --> 0:01:11,000
for different species of malarial infections.

24
0:01:12.175,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now it's actually very simple to put a face

25
0:01:14.986,000 --> 0:01:15,000
to many of these monsters.

26
0:01:16.781,000 --> 0:01:18,000
You take a stain, like acridine orange

27
0:01:19.408,000 --> 0:01:21,000
or a fluorescent stain or Giemsa,

28
0:01:21.525,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and a microscope, and you look at them.

29
0:01:24.638,000 --> 0:01:26,000
They all have faces.

30
0:01:27.018,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Why is that so, that Alex in Kenya,

31
0:01:29.656,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Fatima in Bangladesh, Navjoot in Mumbai,

32
0:01:32.884,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months

33
0:01:36.305,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to be able to diagnose why they are sick?

34
0:01:39.884,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And that's primarily because scalability

35
0:01:42.91,000 --> 0:01:45,000
of the diagnostics is completely out of reach.

36
0:01:45.942,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And remember that number: one billion.

37
0:01:49.858,000 --> 0:01:52,000
The problem lies with the microscope itself.

38
0:01:53.759,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Even though the pinnacle of modern science,

39
0:01:56.135,000 --> 0:01:59,000
research microscopes are not designed for field testing.

40
0:01:59.27,000 --> 0:02:,000
Neither were they first designed

41
0:02:00.95,000 --> 0:02:02,000
for diagnostics at all.

42
0:02:03.101,000 --> 0:02:06,000
They are heavy, bulky, really hard to maintain,

43
0:02:06.489,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and cost a lot of money.

44
0:02:08.79,000 --> 0:02:11,000
This picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the '40s

45
0:02:12.195,000 --> 0:02:15,000
using the exact same setup that we actually use today

46
0:02:15.489,000 --> 0:02:17,000
for diagnosing T.B. in his ashram

47
0:02:18.173,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in Sevagram in India.

48
0:02:20.618,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Two of my students, Jim and James,

49
0:02:23.945,000 --> 0:02:25,000
traveled around India and Thailand,

50
0:02:26.265,000 --> 0:02:28,000
starting to think about this problem a lot.

51
0:02:28.517,000 --> 0:02:3,000
We saw all kinds of donated equipment.

52
0:02:30.992,000 --> 0:02:32,000
We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses.

53
0:02:33.904,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And we saw people who had a functional microscope

54
0:02:36.099,000 --> 0:02:38,000
but just didn't know how to even turn it on.

55
0:02:39.05,000 --> 0:02:41,000
What grew out of that work and that trip

56
0:02:41.69,000 --> 0:02:44,000
was actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes.

57
0:02:45.441,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So what is a Foldscope?

58
0:02:47.264,000 --> 0:02:5,000
A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope,

59
0:02:50.813,000 --> 0:02:53,000
a platform for fluorescence, bright-field,

60
0:02:53.943,000 --> 0:02:54,000
polarization, projection,

61
0:02:55.518,000 --> 0:02:57,000
all kinds of advanced microscopy

62
0:02:58.086,000 --> 0:03:01,000
built purely by folding paper.

63
0:03:01.301,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So, now you think, how is that possible?

64
0:03:04.162,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I'm going to show you some examples here,

65
0:03:06.125,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and we will run through some of them.

66
0:03:07.926,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It starts with a single sheet of paper.

67
0:03:11.71,000 --> 0:03:14,000
What you see here is all the possible components

68
0:03:15.081,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to build a functional bright-field and fluorescence microscope.

69
0:03:19.506,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So, there are three stages:

70
0:03:21.315,000 --> 0:03:23,000
There is the optical stage, the illumination stage

71
0:03:24.064,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and the mask-holding stage.

72
0:03:26.532,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And there are micro optics at the bottom

73
0:03:28.404,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that's actually embedded in the paper itself.

74
0:03:31.278,000 --> 0:03:33,000
What you do is, you take it on,

75
0:03:33.782,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and just like you are playing like a toy,

76
0:03:36.558,000 --> 0:03:39,000
which it is,

77
0:03:40.584,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I tab it off,

78
0:03:47.039,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and I break it off.

79
0:03:49.221,000 --> 0:03:51,000
This paper has no instructions and no languages.

80
0:03:51.945,000 --> 0:03:53,000
There is a code, a color code embedded,

81
0:03:54.264,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope.

82
0:03:58.875,000 --> 0:04:,000
When it's done, it looks something like this,

83
0:04:01.524,000 --> 0:04:03,000
has all the functionalities of a standard microscope,

84
0:04:04.255,000 --> 0:04:05,000
just like an XY stage,

85
0:04:06.136,000 --> 0:04:1,000
a place where a sample slide could go,

86
0:04:10.557,000 --> 0:04:12,000
for example right here.

87
0:04:13.097,000 --> 0:04:14,000
We didn't want to change this,

88
0:04:14.609,000 --> 0:04:15,000
because this is the standard

89
0:04:15.981,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that's been optimized for over the years,

90
0:04:17.834,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and many health workers are actually used to this.

91
0:04:20.53,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So this is what changes,

92
0:04:21.991,000 --> 0:04:23,000
but the standard stains all remain the same

93
0:04:24.158,000 --> 0:04:25,000
for many different diseases.

94
0:04:25.933,000 --> 0:04:27,000
You pop this in.

95
0:04:28.865,000 --> 0:04:31,000
There is an XY stage,

96
0:04:32.751,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and then there is a focusing stage,

97
0:04:34.724,000 --> 0:04:35,000
which is a flexure mechanism

98
0:04:36.59,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that's built in paper itself that allows us to move

99
0:04:39.143,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and focus the lenses by micron steps.

100
0:04:42.124,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So what's really interesting about this object,

101
0:04:44.257,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and my students hate when I do this,

102
0:04:46.14,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but I'm going to do this anyway,

103
0:04:47.901,000 --> 0:04:48,000
is these are rugged devices.

104
0:04:49.857,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I can turn it on and throw it on the floor

105
0:04:54.434,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and really try to stomp on it.

106
0:04:57.386,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And they last, even though they're designed

107
0:04:59.761,000 --> 0:05:02,000
from a very flexible material, like paper.

108
0:05:03.224,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Another fun fact is, this is what we actually

109
0:05:06.076,000 --> 0:05:1,000
send out there as a standard diagnostic tool,

110
0:05:10.131,000 --> 0:05:11,000
but here in this envelope

111
0:05:11.9,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I have 30 different foldscopes

112
0:05:14.291,000 --> 0:05:19,000
of different configurations all in a single folder.

113
0:05:20.022,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And I'm going to pick one randomly.

114
0:05:21.834,000 --> 0:05:23,000
This one, it turns out, is actually designed

115
0:05:23.916,000 --> 0:05:24,000
specifically for malaria,

116
0:05:25.479,000 --> 0:05:27,000
because it has the fluorescent filters built

117
0:05:27.79,000 --> 0:05:29,000
specifically for diagnosing malaria.

118
0:05:29.887,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes

119
0:05:33.815,000 --> 0:05:34,000
comes out of this.

120
0:05:35.581,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So up till now, you didn't actually see

121
0:05:38.52,000 --> 0:05:4,000
what I would see from one of these setups.

122
0:05:41.477,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So what I would like to do is,

123
0:05:43.158,000 --> 0:05:44,000
if we could dim the lights, please,

124
0:05:44.784,000 --> 0:05:47,000
it turns out foldscopes are also projection microscopes.

125
0:05:48.449,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I have these two microscopes that I'm going to turn --

126
0:05:50.983,000 --> 0:05:51,000
go to the back of the wall --

127
0:05:52.736,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and just project, and this way you will see

128
0:05:54.444,000 --> 0:05:56,000
exactly what I would see.

129
0:05:56.564,000 --> 0:05:57,000
What you're looking at --

130
0:05:58.35,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Applause) —

131
0:06:00.733,000 --> 0:06:02,000
This is a cross-section of a compound eye,

132
0:06:03.369,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and when I'm going to zoom in closer, right there,

133
0:06:05.72,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I am going through the z-axis.

134
0:06:07.964,000 --> 0:06:1,000
You actually see how the lenses are cut together

135
0:06:10.988,000 --> 0:06:11,000
in the cross-section pattern.

136
0:06:12.561,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Another example, one of my favorite insects,

137
0:06:15.117,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I love to hate this one,

138
0:06:17.094,000 --> 0:06:18,000
is a mosquito,

139
0:06:18.875,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and you're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens.

140
0:06:22.637,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Right there.

141
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
All from the simple setup that I actually described.

142
0:06:30.213,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So my wife has been field testing

143
0:06:31.986,000 --> 0:06:33,000
some of our microscopes

144
0:06:33.986,000 --> 0:06:35,000
by washing my clothes whenever I forget them

145
0:06:36.467,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in the dryer.

146
0:06:38.496,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So it turns out they're waterproof, and --

147
0:06:41.296,000 --> 0:06:42,000
(Laughter) —

148
0:06:43.084,000 --> 0:06:45,000
right here is just fluorescent water,

149
0:06:45.582,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and I don't know if you can actually see this.

150
0:06:47.132,000 --> 0:06:49,000
This also shows you how the projection scope works.

151
0:06:49.521,000 --> 0:06:52,000
You get to see the beam the way it's projected and bent.

152
0:06:56.199,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Can we get the lights back on again?

153
0:06:59.139,000 --> 0:07:,000
So I'm quickly going to show you,

154
0:07:00.926,000 --> 0:07:02,000
since I'm running out of time,

155
0:07:02.975,000 --> 0:07:04,000
in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture,

156
0:07:05.401,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the biggest idea was roll-to-roll manufacturing,

157
0:07:08.481,000 --> 0:07:11,000
so we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs.

158
0:07:11.603,000 --> 0:07:13,000
(Applause)

159
0:07:14.462,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And what this allows us to do

160
0:07:16.557,000 --> 0:07:18,000
is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy,

161
0:07:18.893,000 --> 0:07:2,000
which we call use-and-throw microscopy.

162
0:07:20.91,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I'm going to give you a quick snapshot

163
0:07:22.999,000 --> 0:07:23,000
of some of the parts that go in.

164
0:07:24.762,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Here is a sheet of paper.

165
0:07:26.221,000 --> 0:07:28,000
This is when we were thinking about the idea.

166
0:07:28.31,000 --> 0:07:29,000
This is an A4 sheet of paper.

167
0:07:29.665,000 --> 0:07:3,000
These are the three stages that you actually see.

168
0:07:31.646,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And the optical components, if you look at the inset up on the right,

169
0:07:35.076,000 --> 0:07:37,000
we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses

170
0:07:37.503,000 --> 0:07:39,000
in paper itself at really high throughputs,

171
0:07:39.815,000 --> 0:07:4,000
so it uses a process of self-assembly

172
0:07:41.674,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and surface tension

173
0:07:42.786,000 --> 0:07:45,000
to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself.

174
0:07:46.322,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So that's where the lenses go.

175
0:07:47.767,000 --> 0:07:48,000
There are some light sources.

176
0:07:49.379,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And essentially, in the end,

177
0:07:50.764,000 --> 0:07:53,000
all the parts line up because of origami,

178
0:07:53.942,000 --> 0:07:56,000
because of the fact that origami allows us

179
0:07:57.213,000 --> 0:07:59,000
micron-scale precision of optical alignment.

180
0:08:00.193,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So even though this looks like a simple toy,

181
0:08:02.822,000 --> 0:08:03,000
the aspects of engineering that go in

182
0:08:04.736,000 --> 0:08:06,000
something like this are fairly sophisticated.

183
0:08:07.422,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So here is another obvious thing that we would do,

184
0:08:10.657,000 --> 0:08:11,000
typically, if I was going to show

185
0:08:12.25,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that these microscopes are robust,

186
0:08:13.755,000 --> 0:08:16,000
is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself.

187
0:08:17.593,000 --> 0:08:2,000
There it is, and it survives.

188
0:08:20.916,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So for us, the next step actually

189
0:08:23.093,000 --> 0:08:24,000
is really finishing our field trials.

190
0:08:24.932,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We are starting at the end of the summer.

191
0:08:27.037,000 --> 0:08:29,000
We are at a stage where we'll be making thousands of microscopes.

192
0:08:29.964,000 --> 0:08:31,000
That would be the first time where we would be

193
0:08:32.108,000 --> 0:08:34,000
doing field trials with the highest density

194
0:08:34.193,000 --> 0:08:36,000
of microscopes ever at a given place.

195
0:08:36.748,000 --> 0:08:38,000
We've started collecting data for malaria,

196
0:08:38.828,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves.

197
0:08:42.624,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And I want to leave you with this picture.

198
0:08:44.718,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I had not anticipated this before,

199
0:08:46.643,000 --> 0:08:47,000
but a really interesting link

200
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
between hands-on science education

201
0:08:50.225,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and global health.

202
0:08:51.483,000 --> 0:08:53,000
What are the tools that we're actually providing

203
0:08:54.409,000 --> 0:08:56,000
the kids who are going to fight

204
0:08:56.589,000 --> 0:08:57,000
this monster soup for tomorrow?

205
0:08:58.507,000 --> 0:09:,000
I would love for them to be able to just print out

206
0:09:00.865,000 --> 0:09:02,000
a Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets.

207
0:09:02.994,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Thank you.

208
0:09:05.9,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Applause)

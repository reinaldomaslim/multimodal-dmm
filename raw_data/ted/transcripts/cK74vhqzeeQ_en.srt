1
0:00:12.621,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Could I protect my father

2
0:00:13.993,000 --> 0:00:16,000
from the Armed Islamic Group with a paring knife?

3
0:00:17.168,000 --> 0:00:18,000
That was the question I faced

4
0:00:18.729,000 --> 0:00:2,000
one Tuesday morning in June of 1993,

5
0:00:21.497,000 --> 0:00:22,000
when I was a law student.

6
0:00:23.339,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I woke up early that morning

7
0:00:25.277,000 --> 0:00:26,000
in Dad's apartment

8
0:00:26.397,000 --> 0:00:28,000
on the outskirts of Algiers, Algeria,

9
0:00:28.695,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to an unrelenting pounding on the front door.

10
0:00:31.969,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It was a season as described by a local paper

11
0:00:34.729,000 --> 0:00:36,000
when every Tuesday a scholar fell

12
0:00:37.585,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to the bullets of fundamentalist assassins.

13
0:00:40.768,000 --> 0:00:42,000
My father's university teaching of Darwin

14
0:00:43.13,000 --> 0:00:45,000
had already provoked a classroom visit

15
0:00:45.13,000 --> 0:00:48,000
from the head of the so-called Islamic Salvation Front,

16
0:00:48.601,000 --> 0:00:51,000
who denounced Dad as an advocate of biologism

17
0:00:51.657,000 --> 0:00:53,000
before Dad had ejected the man,

18
0:00:54.323,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and now whoever was outside

19
0:00:55.81,000 --> 0:00:58,000
would neither identify himself nor go away.

20
0:00:58.91,000 --> 0:01:,000
So my father tried to get the police on the phone,

21
0:01:01.882,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but perhaps terrified by the rising tide

22
0:01:03.98,000 --> 0:01:05,000
of armed extremism that had already claimed

23
0:01:06.404,000 --> 0:01:08,000
the lives of so many Algerian officers,

24
0:01:08.937,000 --> 0:01:1,000
they didn't even answer.

25
0:01:11.063,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And that was when I went to the kitchen,

26
0:01:13.402,000 --> 0:01:14,000
got out a paring knife,

27
0:01:14.777,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and took up a position inside the entryway.

28
0:01:17.755,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It was a ridiculous thing to do, really,

29
0:01:19.302,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but I couldn't think of anything else,

30
0:01:21.151,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and so there I stood.

31
0:01:23.74,000 --> 0:01:25,000
When I look back now, I think that that was the moment

32
0:01:26.247,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that set me on the path was to writing a book

33
0:01:28.761,000 --> 0:01:3,000
called "Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here:

34
0:01:31.413,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Untold Stories from the Fight Against Muslim Fundamentalism."

35
0:01:35.45,000 --> 0:01:37,000
The title comes from a Pakistani play.

36
0:01:38.416,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I think it was actually that moment

37
0:01:41.266,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that sent me on the journey

38
0:01:43.01,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to interview 300 people of Muslim heritage

39
0:01:45.96,000 --> 0:01:46,000
from nearly 30 countries,

40
0:01:47.494,000 --> 0:01:49,000
from Afghanistan to Mali,

41
0:01:49.91,000 --> 0:01:51,000
to find out how they fought fundamentalism

42
0:01:52.251,000 --> 0:01:54,000
peacefully like my father did,

43
0:01:54.479,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and how they coped with the attendant risks.

44
0:01:58.214,000 --> 0:02:,000
Luckily, back in June of 1993,

45
0:02:00.431,000 --> 0:02:02,000
our unidentified visitor went away,

46
0:02:03.263,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but other families were so much less lucky,

47
0:02:06.308,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and that was the thought that motivated my research.

48
0:02:10.161,000 --> 0:02:11,000
In any case, someone would return

49
0:02:11.691,000 --> 0:02:12,000
a few months later and leave a note

50
0:02:13.275,000 --> 0:02:14,000
on Dad's kitchen table,

51
0:02:14.727,000 --> 0:02:18,000
which simply said, "Consider yourself dead."

52
0:02:18.857,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Subsequently, Algeria's fundamentalist armed groups

53
0:02:21.845,000 --> 0:02:24,000
would murder as many as 200,000 civilians

54
0:02:24.908,000 --> 0:02:25,000
in what came to be known

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
as the dark decade of the 1990s,

56
0:02:29.138,000 --> 0:02:3,000
including every single one

57
0:02:31.01,000 --> 0:02:34,000
of the women that you see here.

58
0:02:34.257,000 --> 0:02:36,000
In its harsh counterterrorist response,

59
0:02:37.13,000 --> 0:02:38,000
the state resorted to torture

60
0:02:39.127,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and to forced disappearances,

61
0:02:40.838,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and as terrible as all of these events became,

62
0:02:44.2,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the international community largely ignored them.

63
0:02:47.835,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Finally, my father, an Algerian peasant's son turned professor,

64
0:02:51.558,000 --> 0:02:53,000
was forced to stop teaching at the university

65
0:02:53.661,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and to flee his apartment,

66
0:02:55.85,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but what I will never forget

67
0:02:57.223,000 --> 0:02:59,000
about Mahfoud Bennoune, my dad,

68
0:02:59.458,000 --> 0:03:01,000
was that like so many other Algerian intellectuals,

69
0:03:02.167,000 --> 0:03:03,000
he refused to leave the country

70
0:03:03.941,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and he continued to publish pointed criticisms,

71
0:03:06.999,000 --> 0:03:07,000
both of the fundamentalists

72
0:03:08.949,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and sometimes of the government they battled.

73
0:03:11.919,000 --> 0:03:14,000
For example, in a November 1994 series

74
0:03:15.041,000 --> 0:03:17,000
in the newspaper El Watan

75
0:03:17.195,000 --> 0:03:18,000
entitled "How Fundamentalism

76
0:03:18.704,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Produced a Terrorism without Precedent,"

77
0:03:22.246,000 --> 0:03:23,000
he denounced what he called

78
0:03:23.483,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the terrorists' radical break with the true Islam

79
0:03:26.816,000 --> 0:03:28,000
as it was lived by our ancestors.

80
0:03:29.684,000 --> 0:03:31,000
These were words that could get you killed.

81
0:03:32.515,000 --> 0:03:33,000
My father's country taught me

82
0:03:33.992,000 --> 0:03:35,000
in that dark decade of the 1990s that

83
0:03:36.546,000 --> 0:03:39,000
the popular struggle against Muslim fundamentalism

84
0:03:39.954,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is one of the most important

85
0:03:41.642,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and overlooked human rights struggles

86
0:03:44.173,000 --> 0:03:45,000
in the world.

87
0:03:45.928,000 --> 0:03:48,000
This remains true today, nearly 20 years later.

88
0:03:49.539,000 --> 0:03:5,000
You see, in every country

89
0:03:51.12,000 --> 0:03:52,000
where you hear about armed jihadis

90
0:03:52.97,000 --> 0:03:53,000
targeting civilians,

91
0:03:54.726,000 --> 0:03:55,000
there are also unarmed people

92
0:03:56.401,000 --> 0:03:58,000
defying those militants that you don't hear about,

93
0:03:59.248,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and those people need our support to succeed.

94
0:04:03.83,000 --> 0:04:04,000
In the West, it's often assumed

95
0:04:05.648,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that Muslims generally condone terrorism.

96
0:04:08.685,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Some on the right think this because they view

97
0:04:10.687,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Muslim culture as inherently violent,

98
0:04:12.95,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and some on the left imagine this

99
0:04:14.535,000 --> 0:04:15,000
because they view Muslim violence,

100
0:04:16.323,000 --> 0:04:17,000
fundamentalist violence,

101
0:04:17.674,000 --> 0:04:2,000
solely as a product of legitimate grievances.

102
0:04:21.307,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But both views are dead wrong.

103
0:04:23.804,000 --> 0:04:24,000
In fact, many people of Muslim heritage

104
0:04:25.619,000 --> 0:04:27,000
around the world are staunch opponents

105
0:04:28.383,000 --> 0:04:31,000
both of fundamentalism and of terrorism,

106
0:04:31.644,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and often for very good reason.

107
0:04:34.11,000 --> 0:04:36,000
You see, they're much more likely to be victims

108
0:04:36.15,000 --> 0:04:39,000
of this violence than its perpetrators.

109
0:04:39.305,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Let me just give you one example.

110
0:04:41.322,000 --> 0:04:43,000
According to a 2009 survey

111
0:04:44.165,000 --> 0:04:46,000
of Arabic language media resources,

112
0:04:46.505,000 --> 0:04:49,000
between 2004 and 2008,

113
0:04:49.756,000 --> 0:04:52,000
no more than 15 percent of al Qaeda's victims

114
0:04:52.88,000 --> 0:04:53,000
were Westerners.

115
0:04:54.461,000 --> 0:04:56,000
That's a terrible toll, but the vast majority

116
0:04:57.406,000 --> 0:04:58,000
were people of Muslim heritage,

117
0:04:59.175,000 --> 0:05:01,000
killed by Muslim fundamentalists.

118
0:05:01.991,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Now I've been talking for the last five minutes

119
0:05:04.819,000 --> 0:05:06,000
about fundamentalism, and you have a right to know

120
0:05:07.302,000 --> 0:05:08,000
exactly what I mean.

121
0:05:08.996,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I cite the definition given by the Algerian sociologist

122
0:05:12.901,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Marieme Helie Lucas,

123
0:05:14.94,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and she says that fundamentalisms,

124
0:05:17.336,000 --> 0:05:19,000
note the "s," so within all of the world's

125
0:05:19.834,000 --> 0:05:2,000
great religious traditions,

126
0:05:21.656,000 --> 0:05:24,000
"fundamentalisms are political movements of the extreme right

127
0:05:25.627,000 --> 0:05:27,000
which in a context of globalization

128
0:05:27.79,000 --> 0:05:29,000
manipulate religion in order to achieve

129
0:05:30.284,000 --> 0:05:31,000
their political aims."

130
0:05:31.933,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Sadia Abbas has called this the radical politicization

131
0:05:35.616,000 --> 0:05:36,000
of theology.

132
0:05:37.127,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Now I want to avoid projecting the notion

133
0:05:39.542,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that there's sort of a monolith out there

134
0:05:41.328,000 --> 0:05:44,000
called Muslim fundamentalism that is the same everywhere,

135
0:05:44.541,000 --> 0:05:46,000
because these movements also have their diversities.

136
0:05:47.257,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Some use and advocate violence.

137
0:05:49.72,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Some do not, though they're often interrelated.

138
0:05:52.35,000 --> 0:05:53,000
They take different forms.

139
0:05:53.92,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Some may be non-governmental organizations,

140
0:05:56.544,000 --> 0:05:58,000
even here in Britain like Cageprisoners.

141
0:05:59.076,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Some may become political parties,

142
0:06:01.169,000 --> 0:06:02,000
like the Muslim Brotherhood,

143
0:06:02.74,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and some may be openly armed groups

144
0:06:04.458,000 --> 0:06:05,000
like the Taliban.

145
0:06:06.183,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But in any case, these are all radical projects.

146
0:06:09.504,000 --> 0:06:12,000
They're not conservative or traditional approaches.

147
0:06:12.733,000 --> 0:06:15,000
They're most often about changing people's relationship with Islam

148
0:06:15.946,000 --> 0:06:16,000
rather than preserving it.

149
0:06:17.501,000 --> 0:06:2,000
What I am talking about is the Muslim extreme right,

150
0:06:20.891,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and the fact that its adherents are

151
0:06:22.89,000 --> 0:06:23,000
or purport to be Muslim

152
0:06:24.73,000 --> 0:06:25,000
makes them no less offensive

153
0:06:26.14,000 --> 0:06:28,000
than the extreme right anywhere else.

154
0:06:28.631,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So in my view, if we consider ourselves

155
0:06:30.498,000 --> 0:06:31,000
liberal or left-wing,

156
0:06:32.248,000 --> 0:06:34,000
human rights-loving or feminist,

157
0:06:34.708,000 --> 0:06:36,000
we must oppose these movements

158
0:06:36.909,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and support their grassroots opponents.

159
0:06:39.754,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Now let me be clear

160
0:06:41.37,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that I support an effective struggle

161
0:06:43.372,000 --> 0:06:44,000
against fundamentalism,

162
0:06:45.317,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but also a struggle that must itself

163
0:06:47.597,000 --> 0:06:48,000
respect international law,

164
0:06:49.535,000 --> 0:06:51,000
so nothing I am saying should be taken

165
0:06:51.964,000 --> 0:06:52,000
as a justification for refusals

166
0:06:53.809,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to democratize,

167
0:06:55.274,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and here I send out a shout-out of support

168
0:06:57.949,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to the pro-democracy movement in Algeria today, Barakat.

169
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Nor should anything I say be taken

170
0:07:04.282,000 --> 0:07:06,000
as a justification of violations of human rights,

171
0:07:07.149,000 --> 0:07:08,000
like the mass death sentences

172
0:07:08.555,000 --> 0:07:1,000
handed out in Egypt earlier this week.

173
0:07:11.475,000 --> 0:07:12,000
But what I am saying

174
0:07:12.998,000 --> 0:07:15,000
is that we must challenge these Muslim fundamentalist movements

175
0:07:16.305,000 --> 0:07:17,000
because they threaten human rights

176
0:07:18.123,000 --> 0:07:2,000
across Muslim-majority contexts,

177
0:07:20.706,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and they do this in a range of ways,

178
0:07:23.087,000 --> 0:07:25,000
most obviously with the direct attacks on civilians

179
0:07:26.05,000 --> 0:07:28,000
by the armed groups that carry those out.

180
0:07:28.289,000 --> 0:07:31,000
But that violence is just the tip of the iceberg.

181
0:07:31.336,000 --> 0:07:33,000
These movements as a whole purvey discrimination

182
0:07:34.127,000 --> 0:07:37,000
against religious minorities and sexual minorities.

183
0:07:37.448,000 --> 0:07:39,000
They seek to curtail the freedom of religion

184
0:07:39.528,000 --> 0:07:41,000
of everyone who either practices in a different way

185
0:07:42.427,000 --> 0:07:43,000
or chooses not to practice.

186
0:07:44.391,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And most definingly, they lead an all-out war

187
0:07:47.815,000 --> 0:07:49,000
on the rights of women.

188
0:07:49.896,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Now, faced with these movements

189
0:07:51.692,000 --> 0:07:52,000
in recent years, Western discourse

190
0:07:53.264,000 --> 0:07:54,000
has most often offered

191
0:07:54.899,000 --> 0:07:56,000
two flawed responses.

192
0:07:57.156,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The first that one sometimes finds on the right

193
0:07:59.719,000 --> 0:08:01,000
suggests that most Muslims are fundamentalist

194
0:08:02.261,000 --> 0:08:05,000
or something about Islam is inherently fundamentalist,

195
0:08:05.607,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and this is just offensive and wrong,

196
0:08:08.898,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but unfortunately on the left one sometimes encounters

197
0:08:11.306,000 --> 0:08:13,000
a discourse that is too politically correct

198
0:08:13.488,000 --> 0:08:16,000
to acknowledge the problem of Muslim fundamentalism at all

199
0:08:17.29,000 --> 0:08:19,000
or, even worse, apologizes for it,

200
0:08:19.651,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and this is unacceptable as well.

201
0:08:22.199,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So what I'm seeking is a new way

202
0:08:24.261,000 --> 0:08:26,000
of talking about this all together,

203
0:08:26.382,000 --> 0:08:28,000
which is grounded in the lived experiences

204
0:08:29.11,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and the hope of the people on the front lines.

205
0:08:32.059,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I'm painfully aware that there has been

206
0:08:34.01,000 --> 0:08:37,000
an increase in discrimination against Muslims in recent years

207
0:08:37.191,000 --> 0:08:39,000
in countries like the U.K. and the U.S.,

208
0:08:39.662,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and that too is a matter of grave concern,

209
0:08:42.716,000 --> 0:08:43,000
but I firmly believe

210
0:08:43.855,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that telling these counter-stereotypical stories

211
0:08:46.816,000 --> 0:08:47,000
of people of Muslim heritage

212
0:08:48.142,000 --> 0:08:5,000
who have confronted the fundamentalists

213
0:08:50.314,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and been their primary victims

214
0:08:52.329,000 --> 0:08:56,000
is also a great way of countering that discrimination.

215
0:08:56.906,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So now let me introduce you

216
0:08:58.686,000 --> 0:08:59,000
to four people whose stories

217
0:09:00.342,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I had the great honor of telling.

218
0:09:03.558,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Faizan Peerzada and the Rafi Peer Theatre

219
0:09:05.791,000 --> 0:09:07,000
workshop named for his father

220
0:09:07.793,000 --> 0:09:09,000
have for years promoted the performing arts

221
0:09:09.931,000 --> 0:09:1,000
in Pakistan.

222
0:09:11.663,000 --> 0:09:12,000
With the rise of jihadist violence,

223
0:09:13.124,000 --> 0:09:14,000
they began to receive threats

224
0:09:14.7,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to call off their events, which they refused to heed.

225
0:09:17.95,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And so a bomber struck their 2008

226
0:09:21.22,000 --> 0:09:23,000
eighth world performing arts festival in Lahore,

227
0:09:24.104,000 --> 0:09:25,000
producing rain of glass

228
0:09:25.792,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that fell into the venue

229
0:09:27.457,000 --> 0:09:28,000
injuring nine people,

230
0:09:29.392,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and later that same night,

231
0:09:30.96,000 --> 0:09:32,000
the Peerzadas made a very difficult decision:

232
0:09:33.711,000 --> 0:09:34,000
they announced that their festival

233
0:09:35.58,000 --> 0:09:38,000
would continue as planned the next day.

234
0:09:38.987,000 --> 0:09:39,000
As Faizan said at the time,

235
0:09:40.438,000 --> 0:09:41,000
if we bow down to the Islamists,

236
0:09:42.38,000 --> 0:09:45,000
we'll just be sitting in a dark corner.

237
0:09:45.491,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But they didn't know what would happen.

238
0:09:47.149,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Would anyone come?

239
0:09:49.586,000 --> 0:09:51,000
In fact, thousands of people came out the next day

240
0:09:52.475,000 --> 0:09:54,000
to support the performing arts in Lahore,

241
0:09:54.877,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and this simultaneously thrilled

242
0:09:56.722,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and terrified Faizan,

243
0:09:58.544,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and he ran up to a woman

244
0:09:59.997,000 --> 0:10:01,000
who had come in with her two small children,

245
0:10:02.214,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and he said, "You do know there was a bomb here yesterday,

246
0:10:05.408,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and you do know there's a threat here today."

247
0:10:07.735,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And she said, "I know that,

248
0:10:09.618,000 --> 0:10:1,000
but I came to your festival

249
0:10:11.182,000 --> 0:10:13,000
with my mother when I was their age,

250
0:10:13.612,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and I still have those images in my mind.

251
0:10:16.66,000 --> 0:10:18,000
We have to be here."

252
0:10:18.798,000 --> 0:10:19,000
With stalwart audiences like this,

253
0:10:20.655,000 --> 0:10:21,000
the Peerzadas were able to conclude

254
0:10:22.309,000 --> 0:10:24,000
their festival on schedule.

255
0:10:24.769,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And then the next year,

256
0:10:26.006,000 --> 0:10:27,000
they lost all of their sponsors

257
0:10:27.889,000 --> 0:10:29,000
due to the security risk.

258
0:10:30.258,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So when I met them in 2010,

259
0:10:32.558,000 --> 0:10:34,000
they were in the middle of the first subsequent event

260
0:10:34.844,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that they were able to have in the same venue,

261
0:10:37.91,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and this was the ninth youth performing arts festival

262
0:10:41.174,000 --> 0:10:43,000
held in Lahore in a year when that city

263
0:10:44.149,000 --> 0:10:48,000
had already experienced 44 terror attacks.

264
0:10:48.219,000 --> 0:10:5,000
This was a time when the Pakistani Taliban

265
0:10:50.322,000 --> 0:10:51,000
had commenced their systematic targeting

266
0:10:52.139,000 --> 0:10:54,000
of girls' schools that would culminate

267
0:10:54.347,000 --> 0:10:56,000
in the attack on Malala Yousafzai.

268
0:10:57.106,000 --> 0:11:01,000
What did the Peerzadas do in that environment?

269
0:11:01.501,000 --> 0:11:04,000
They staged girls' school theater.

270
0:11:04.674,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So I had the privilege of watching "Naang Wal,"

271
0:11:07.486,000 --> 0:11:09,000
which was a musical in the Punjabi language,

272
0:11:10.118,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and the girls of Lahore Grammar School

273
0:11:11.88,000 --> 0:11:12,000
played all the parts.

274
0:11:13.606,000 --> 0:11:14,000
They sang and danced,

275
0:11:14.84,000 --> 0:11:16,000
they played the mice and the water buffalo,

276
0:11:17.498,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and I held my breath, wondering,

277
0:11:19.962,000 --> 0:11:2,000
would we get to the end

278
0:11:21.229,000 --> 0:11:23,000
of this amazing show?

279
0:11:23.515,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And when we did, the whole audience

280
0:11:26.071,000 --> 0:11:27,000
collectively exhaled,

281
0:11:27.809,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and a few people actually wept,

282
0:11:30.073,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and then they filled the auditorium

283
0:11:32.596,000 --> 0:11:34,000
with the peaceful boom of their applause.

284
0:11:35.435,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And I remember thinking in that moment

285
0:11:38.422,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that the bombers made headlines here

286
0:11:40.853,000 --> 0:11:41,000
two years before

287
0:11:42.516,000 --> 0:11:44,000
but this night and these people

288
0:11:44.88,000 --> 0:11:47,000
are as important a story.

289
0:11:50.488,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Maria Bashir is the first and only

290
0:11:52.968,000 --> 0:11:55,000
woman chief prosecutor in Afghanistan.

291
0:11:56.092,000 --> 0:11:58,000
She's been in the post since 2008

292
0:11:58.306,000 --> 0:12:,000
and actually opened an office to investigate

293
0:12:00.492,000 --> 0:12:01,000
cases of violence against women,

294
0:12:02.318,000 --> 0:12:04,000
which she says is the most important area

295
0:12:04.576,000 --> 0:12:05,000
in her mandate.

296
0:12:06.31,000 --> 0:12:09,000
When I meet her in her office in Herat,

297
0:12:09.375,000 --> 0:12:1,000
she enters surrounded by

298
0:12:11.12,000 --> 0:12:14,000
four large men with four huge guns.

299
0:12:14.486,000 --> 0:12:16,000
In fact, she now has 23 bodyguards,

300
0:12:17.45,000 --> 0:12:18,000
because she has weathered bomb attacks

301
0:12:18.87,000 --> 0:12:19,000
that nearly killed her kids,

302
0:12:20.548,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and it took the leg off of one of her guards.

303
0:12:23.899,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Why does she continue?

304
0:12:26.009,000 --> 0:12:28,000
She says with a smile that that is the question

305
0:12:28.663,000 --> 0:12:3,000
that everyone asks—

306
0:12:30.71,000 --> 0:12:33,000
as she puts it, "Why you risk not living?"

307
0:12:34.535,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And it is simply that for her,

308
0:12:36.174,000 --> 0:12:39,000
a better future for all the Maria Bashirs to come

309
0:12:39.643,000 --> 0:12:4,000
is worth the risk,

310
0:12:41.127,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and she knows that if people like her

311
0:12:42.837,000 --> 0:12:43,000
do not take the risk,

312
0:12:44.752,000 --> 0:12:46,000
there will be no better future.

313
0:12:47.049,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Later on in our interview,

314
0:12:48.776,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Prosecutor Bashir tells me how worried she is

315
0:12:51.139,000 --> 0:12:52,000
about the possible outcome

316
0:12:52.658,000 --> 0:12:54,000
of government negotiations with the Taliban,

317
0:12:55.157,000 --> 0:12:57,000
the people who have been trying to kill her.

318
0:12:57.551,000 --> 0:12:58,000
"If we give them a place in the government,"

319
0:12:59.303,000 --> 0:13:02,000
she asks, "Who will protect women's rights?"

320
0:13:02.52,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And she urges the international community

321
0:13:04.886,000 --> 0:13:06,000
not to forget its promise about women

322
0:13:07.518,000 --> 0:13:1,000
because now they want peace with Taliban.

323
0:13:11.345,000 --> 0:13:13,000
A few weeks after I leave Afghanistan,

324
0:13:13.55,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I see a headline on the Internet.

325
0:13:16.425,000 --> 0:13:19,000
An Afghan prosecutor has been assassinated.

326
0:13:20.03,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I google desperately,

327
0:13:22.166,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and thankfully that day I find out

328
0:13:23.84,000 --> 0:13:25,000
that Maria was not the victim,

329
0:13:25.926,000 --> 0:13:27,000
though sadly, another Afghan prosecutor

330
0:13:28.149,000 --> 0:13:3,000
was gunned down on his way to work.

331
0:13:30.18,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And when I hear headlines like that now,

332
0:13:33.175,000 --> 0:13:35,000
I think that as international troops

333
0:13:35.473,000 --> 0:13:38,000
leave Afghanistan this year and beyond,

334
0:13:38.521,000 --> 0:13:39,000
we must continue to care

335
0:13:40.427,000 --> 0:13:41,000
about what happens to people there,

336
0:13:41.86,000 --> 0:13:44,000
to all of the Maria Bashirs.

337
0:13:44.886,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Sometimes I still hear her voice in my head

338
0:13:47.499,000 --> 0:13:5,000
saying, with no bravado whatsoever,

339
0:13:50.58,000 --> 0:13:52,000
"The situation of the women of Afghanistan

340
0:13:53.185,000 --> 0:13:54,000
will be better someday.

341
0:13:55.091,000 --> 0:13:57,000
We should prepare the ground for this,

342
0:13:57.326,000 --> 0:13:59,000
even if we are killed."

343
0:14:01.854,000 --> 0:14:02,000
There are no words adequate

344
0:14:03.502,000 --> 0:14:04,000
to denounce the al Shabaab terrorists

345
0:14:05.478,000 --> 0:14:07,000
who attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi

346
0:14:07.74,000 --> 0:14:1,000
on the same day as a children's cooking competition

347
0:14:11.202,000 --> 0:14:13,000
in September of 2013.

348
0:14:13.62,000 --> 0:14:17,000
They killed 67, including poets and pregnant women.

349
0:14:18.119,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Far away in the American Midwest,

350
0:14:20.218,000 --> 0:14:22,000
I had the good fortune of meeting Somali-Americans

351
0:14:22.565,000 --> 0:14:24,000
who were working to counter the efforts of al Shabaab

352
0:14:25.413,000 --> 0:14:27,000
to recruit a small number of young people

353
0:14:27.637,000 --> 0:14:28,000
from their city of Minneapolis

354
0:14:29.581,000 --> 0:14:32,000
to take part in atrocities like Westgate.

355
0:14:33.279,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Abdirizak Bihi's studious

356
0:14:35.239,000 --> 0:14:37,000
17-year-old nephew Burhan Hassan

357
0:14:38.128,000 --> 0:14:4,000
was recruited here in 2008,

358
0:14:40.776,000 --> 0:14:41,000
spirited to Somalia,

359
0:14:42.536,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and then killed when he tried to come home.

360
0:14:45.906,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Since that time, Mr. Bihi,

361
0:14:47.5,000 --> 0:14:51,000
who directs the no-budget Somali Education and Advocacy Center,

362
0:14:51.753,000 --> 0:14:53,000
has been vocally denouncing the recruitment

363
0:14:54.204,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and the failures of government

364
0:14:56.06,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and Somali-American institutions

365
0:14:58.279,000 --> 0:15:01,000
like the Abubakar As-Saddique Islamic Center

366
0:15:01.304,000 --> 0:15:03,000
where he believes his nephew was radicalized

367
0:15:03.535,000 --> 0:15:05,000
during a youth program.

368
0:15:05.641,000 --> 0:15:07,000
But he doesn't just criticize the mosque.

369
0:15:07.794,000 --> 0:15:08,000
He also takes on the government

370
0:15:09.373,000 --> 0:15:1,000
for its failure to do more

371
0:15:11.158,000 --> 0:15:13,000
to prevent poverty in his community.

372
0:15:13.656,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Given his own lack of financial resources,

373
0:15:15.945,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Mr. Bihi has had to be creative.

374
0:15:18.256,000 --> 0:15:19,000
To counter the efforts of al Shabaab

375
0:15:20.15,000 --> 0:15:22,000
to sway more disaffected youth,

376
0:15:22.535,000 --> 0:15:24,000
in the wake of the group's 2010 attack

377
0:15:24.97,000 --> 0:15:26,000
on World Cup viewers in Uganda,

378
0:15:27.564,000 --> 0:15:3,000
he organized a Ramadan basketball tournament

379
0:15:30.904,000 --> 0:15:32,000
in Minneapolis in response.

380
0:15:33.436,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Scores of Somali-American kids came out

381
0:15:36.12,000 --> 0:15:37,000
to embrace sport

382
0:15:37.508,000 --> 0:15:39,000
despite the fatwa against it.

383
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:41,000
They played basketball

384
0:15:41.745,000 --> 0:15:44,000
as Burhan Hassan never would again.

385
0:15:45.612,000 --> 0:15:47,000
For his efforts, Mr. Bihi has been ostracized

386
0:15:48.262,000 --> 0:15:51,000
by the leadership of the Abubakar As-Saddique Islamic Center,

387
0:15:51.334,000 --> 0:15:53,000
with which he used to have good relations.

388
0:15:53.899,000 --> 0:15:55,000
He told me, "One day we saw the imam on TV

389
0:15:56.285,000 --> 0:15:58,000
calling us infidels and saying,

390
0:15:58.343,000 --> 0:16:01,000
'These families are trying to destroy the mosque.'"

391
0:16:01.912,000 --> 0:16:02,000
This is at complete odds

392
0:16:03.323,000 --> 0:16:05,000
with how Abdirizak Bihi understands

393
0:16:05.856,000 --> 0:16:06,000
what he is trying to do

394
0:16:07.656,000 --> 0:16:09,000
by exposing al Shabaab recruitment,

395
0:16:10.062,000 --> 0:16:12,000
which is to save the religion I love

396
0:16:12.484,000 --> 0:16:15,000
from a small number of extremists.

397
0:16:16.938,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Now I want to tell one last story,

398
0:16:19.499,000 --> 0:16:22,000
that of a 22-year-old law student in Algeria

399
0:16:22.513,000 --> 0:16:23,000
named Amel Zenoune-Zouani

400
0:16:24.459,000 --> 0:16:25,000
who had the same dreams of a legal career

401
0:16:26.338,000 --> 0:16:28,000
that I did back in the '90s.

402
0:16:29.04,000 --> 0:16:3,000
She refused to give up her studies,

403
0:16:30.969,000 --> 0:16:31,000
despite the fact that the fundamentalists

404
0:16:32.938,000 --> 0:16:34,000
battling the Algerian state back then

405
0:16:35.468,000 --> 0:16:38,000
threatened all who continued their education.

406
0:16:39.09,000 --> 0:16:43,000
On January 26, 1997, Amel boarded the bus

407
0:16:43.2,000 --> 0:16:44,000
in Algiers where she was studying

408
0:16:45.122,000 --> 0:16:47,000
to go home and spend a Ramadan evening

409
0:16:47.305,000 --> 0:16:48,000
with her family,

410
0:16:48.994,000 --> 0:16:5,000
and would never finish law school.

411
0:16:51.38,000 --> 0:16:52,000
When the bus reached the outskirts

412
0:16:52.84,000 --> 0:16:53,000
of her hometown, it was stopped

413
0:16:54.615,000 --> 0:16:56,000
at a checkpoint manned by men

414
0:16:56.757,000 --> 0:16:58,000
from the Armed Islamic Group.

415
0:16:59.051,000 --> 0:17:,000
Carrying her schoolbag,

416
0:17:00.78,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Amel was taken off the bus

417
0:17:02.766,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and killed in the street.

418
0:17:05.355,000 --> 0:17:06,000
The men who cut her throat

419
0:17:06.491,000 --> 0:17:07,000
then told everyone else,

420
0:17:08.341,000 --> 0:17:09,000
"If you go to university,

421
0:17:10.235,000 --> 0:17:12,000
the day will come when we will kill all of you

422
0:17:12.789,000 --> 0:17:15,000
just like this."

423
0:17:16.02,000 --> 0:17:18,000
Amel died at exactly 5:17 p.m.,

424
0:17:18.72,000 --> 0:17:2,000
which we know because when she fell in the street,

425
0:17:21.568,000 --> 0:17:22,000
her watch broke.

426
0:17:23.345,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Her mother showed me the watch

427
0:17:24.574,000 --> 0:17:26,000
with the second hand still aimed

428
0:17:26.575,000 --> 0:17:27,000
optimistically upward

429
0:17:28.071,000 --> 0:17:31,000
towards a 5:18 that would never come.

430
0:17:31.507,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Shortly before her death,

431
0:17:32.656,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Amel had said to her mother of herself

432
0:17:34.511,000 --> 0:17:35,000
and her sisters,

433
0:17:36.398,000 --> 0:17:39,000
"Nothing will happen to us, Inshallah, God willing,

434
0:17:40.015,000 --> 0:17:41,000
but if something happens,

435
0:17:41.885,000 --> 0:17:43,000
you must know that we are dead for knowledge.

436
0:17:44.768,000 --> 0:17:48,000
You and father must keep your heads held high."

437
0:17:48.978,000 --> 0:17:51,000
The loss of such a young woman is unfathomable,

438
0:17:52.96,000 --> 0:17:53,000
and so as I did my research

439
0:17:54.515,000 --> 0:17:57,000
I found myself searching for Amel's hope again

440
0:17:57.769,000 --> 0:17:59,000
and her name even means "hope" in Arabic.

441
0:18:00.706,000 --> 0:18:03,000
I think I found it in two places.

442
0:18:03.957,000 --> 0:18:05,000
The first is in the strength of her family

443
0:18:06.252,000 --> 0:18:09,000
and all the other families to continue telling their stories

444
0:18:09.518,000 --> 0:18:12,000
and to go on with their lives despite the terrorism.

445
0:18:12.583,000 --> 0:18:15,000
In fact, Amel's sister Lamia overcame her grief,

446
0:18:15.865,000 --> 0:18:16,000
went to law school,

447
0:18:17.236,000 --> 0:18:19,000
and practices as a lawyer in Algiers today,

448
0:18:19.99,000 --> 0:18:2,000
something which is only possible

449
0:18:21.591,000 --> 0:18:22,000
because the armed fundamentalists

450
0:18:22.78,000 --> 0:18:24,000
were largely defeated in the country.

451
0:18:25.658,000 --> 0:18:27,000
And the second place I found Amel's hope

452
0:18:28.505,000 --> 0:18:3,000
was everywhere that women and men

453
0:18:30.977,000 --> 0:18:32,000
continue to defy the jihadis.

454
0:18:33.672,000 --> 0:18:36,000
We must support all of those in honor of Amel

455
0:18:36.93,000 --> 0:18:38,000
who continue this human rights struggle today,

456
0:18:39.563,000 --> 0:18:42,000
like the Network of Women Living Under Muslim Laws.

457
0:18:43.56,000 --> 0:18:45,000
It is not enough, as the victims rights advocate

458
0:18:46.187,000 --> 0:18:47,000
Cherifa Kheddar told me in Algiers,

459
0:18:48.074,000 --> 0:18:51,000
it is not enough just to battle terrorism.

460
0:18:51.139,000 --> 0:18:53,000
We must also challenge fundamentalism,

461
0:18:53.683,000 --> 0:18:55,000
because fundamentalism is the ideology

462
0:18:56.12,000 --> 0:18:58,000
that makes the bed of this terrorism.

463
0:18:58.711,000 --> 0:19:01,000
Why is it that people like her, like all of them

464
0:19:02.15,000 --> 0:19:03,000
are not more well known?

465
0:19:03.844,000 --> 0:19:06,000
Why is it that everyone knows who Osama bin Laden was

466
0:19:07.121,000 --> 0:19:08,000
and so few know of all of those

467
0:19:09.054,000 --> 0:19:12,000
standing up to the bin Ladens in their own contexts.

468
0:19:12.747,000 --> 0:19:14,000
We must change that, and so I ask you

469
0:19:15.404,000 --> 0:19:16,000
to please help share these stories

470
0:19:17.172,000 --> 0:19:18,000
through your networks.

471
0:19:18.945,000 --> 0:19:2,000
Look again at Amel Zenoune's watch,

472
0:19:21.044,000 --> 0:19:22,000
forever frozen,

473
0:19:22.704,000 --> 0:19:24,000
and now please look at your own watch

474
0:19:25.066,000 --> 0:19:28,000
and decide this is the moment that you commit

475
0:19:28.09,000 --> 0:19:29,000
to supporting people like Amel.

476
0:19:29.998,000 --> 0:19:31,000
We don't have the right to be silent about them

477
0:19:32.379,000 --> 0:19:33,000
because it is easier

478
0:19:33.877,000 --> 0:19:35,000
or because Western policy is flawed as well,

479
0:19:36.738,000 --> 0:19:38,000
because 5:17 is still coming

480
0:19:39.074,000 --> 0:19:4,000
to too many Amel Zenounes

481
0:19:40.941,000 --> 0:19:41,000
in places like northern Nigeria,

482
0:19:42.911,000 --> 0:19:44,000
where jihadis still kill students.

483
0:19:45.487,000 --> 0:19:48,000
The time to speak up in support of all of those

484
0:19:48.568,000 --> 0:19:5,000
who peacefully challenge fundamentalism

485
0:19:50.876,000 --> 0:19:52,000
and terrorism in their own communities

486
0:19:53.84,000 --> 0:19:54,000
is now.

487
0:19:55.376,000 --> 0:19:57,000
Thank you.

1
0:00:12.489,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Two years ago, I have to say there was no problem.

2
0:00:15.458,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Two years ago, I knew exactly what an icon looked like.

3
0:00:19.516,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It looks like this.

4
0:00:21.871,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Everybody's icon, but also the default position

5
0:00:24.7,000 --> 0:00:27,000
of a curator of Italian Renaissance paintings, which I was then.

6
0:00:28.523,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And in a way, this is also another default selection.

7
0:00:32.215,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Leonardo da Vinci's exquisitely soulful image

8
0:00:36.762,000 --> 0:00:37,000
of the "Lady with an Ermine."

9
0:00:38.062,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And I use that word, soulful, deliberately.

10
0:00:40.605,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Or then there's this, or rather these:

11
0:00:42.988,000 --> 0:00:44,000
the two versions of Leonardo's "Virgin of the Rocks"

12
0:00:45.642,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that were about to come together in London for the very first time.

13
0:00:49.918,000 --> 0:00:53,000
In the exhibition that I was then in the absolute throes of organizing.

14
0:00:54.102,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I was literally up to my eyes in Leonardo,

15
0:00:57.539,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and I had been for three years.

16
0:00:59.357,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So, he was occupying every part of my brain.

17
0:01:03.779,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Leonardo had taught me, during that three years,

18
0:01:06.62,000 --> 0:01:07,000
about what a picture can do.

19
0:01:08.468,000 --> 0:01:13,000
About taking you from your own material world into a spiritual world.

20
0:01:13.786,000 --> 0:01:15,000
He said, actually, that he believed the job of the painter

21
0:01:16.677,000 --> 0:01:2,000
was to paint everything that was visible and invisible in the universe.

22
0:01:21.128,000 --> 0:01:24,000
That's a huge task. And yet, somehow he achieves it.

23
0:01:25.125,000 --> 0:01:27,000
He shows us, I think, the human soul.

24
0:01:27.896,000 --> 0:01:31,000
He shows us the capacity of ourselves

25
0:01:32.342,000 --> 0:01:35,000
to move into a spiritual realm.

26
0:01:35.77,000 --> 0:01:39,000
To see a vision of the universe that's more perfect than our own.

27
0:01:40.298,000 --> 0:01:43,000
To see God's own plan, in some sense.

28
0:01:43.874,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So this, in a sense, was really what I believed an icon was.

29
0:01:47.945,000 --> 0:01:5,000
At about that time, I started talking to Tom Campbell,

30
0:01:51.803,000 --> 0:01:53,000
director here of the Metropolitan Museum,

31
0:01:54.354,000 --> 0:01:57,000
about what my next move might be.

32
0:01:57.678,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The move, in fact, back to an earlier life,

33
0:02:00.449,000 --> 0:02:01,000
one I'd begun at the British Museum,

34
0:02:02.407,000 --> 0:02:04,000
back to the world of three dimensions --

35
0:02:04.926,000 --> 0:02:06,000
of sculpture and of decorative arts --

36
0:02:07.158,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to take over the department of European sculpture and decorative arts, here at the Met.

37
0:02:11.376,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But it was an incredibly busy time.

38
0:02:12.816,000 --> 0:02:15,000
All the conversations were done at very peculiar times of the day --

39
0:02:16.223,000 --> 0:02:18,000
over the phone.

40
0:02:19.136,000 --> 0:02:21,000
In the end, I accepted the job

41
0:02:21.2,000 --> 0:02:22,000
without actually having been here.

42
0:02:22.573,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Again, I'd been there a couple of years before,

43
0:02:25.125,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but on that particular visit.

44
0:02:27.637,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So, it was just before the time that the Leonardo show was due to open

45
0:02:31.729,000 --> 0:02:35,000
when I finally made it back to the Met, to New York,

46
0:02:35.751,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to see my new domain.

47
0:02:37.207,000 --> 0:02:4,000
To see what European sculpture and decorative arts looked like,

48
0:02:41.15,000 --> 0:02:45,000
beyond those Renaissance collections with which I was so already familiar.

49
0:02:45.941,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And I thought, on that very first day, I better tour the galleries.

50
0:02:48.938,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Fifty-seven of these galleries --

51
0:02:50.39,000 --> 0:02:54,000
like 57 varieties of baked beans, I believe.

52
0:02:55.246,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I walked through and I started in my comfort zone in the Italian Renaissance.

53
0:03:01.367,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And then I moved gradually around,

54
0:03:03.288,000 --> 0:03:06,000
feeling a little lost sometimes.

55
0:03:06.39,000 --> 0:03:09,000
My head, also still full of the Leonardo exhibition

56
0:03:09.443,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that was about to open, and I came across this.

57
0:03:13.465,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And I thought to myself: What the hell have I done?

58
0:03:21.395,000 --> 0:03:24,000
There was absolutely no connection in my mind

59
0:03:24.748,000 --> 0:03:27,000
at all and, in fact, if there was any emotion going on,

60
0:03:27.847,000 --> 0:03:29,000
it was a kind of repulsion.

61
0:03:30.216,000 --> 0:03:33,000
This object felt utterly and completely alien.

62
0:03:33.454,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Silly at a level that I hadn't yet understood silliness to be.

63
0:03:38.917,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And then it was made worse --

64
0:03:41.116,000 --> 0:03:42,000
there were two of them.

65
0:03:42.961,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:46.1,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So, I started thinking about why it was, in fact,

67
0:03:49.067,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that I disliked this object so much.

68
0:03:51.523,000 --> 0:03:54,000
What was the anatomy of my distaste?

69
0:03:55.329,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Well, so much gold, so vulgar.

70
0:03:58.797,000 --> 0:04:01,000
You know, so nouveau riche, frankly.

71
0:04:02.651,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Leonardo himself had preached against the use of gold,

72
0:04:05.564,000 --> 0:04:08,000
so it was absolutely anathema at that moment.

73
0:04:08.999,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And then there's little pretty sprigs of flowers everywhere. (Laughter)

74
0:04:14.427,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And finally, that pink. That damned pink.

75
0:04:17.946,000 --> 0:04:19,000
It's such an extraordinarily artificial color.

76
0:04:20.842,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I mean, it's a color that I can't think of anything that you actually see in nature,

77
0:04:24.37,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that looks that shade.

78
0:04:27.458,000 --> 0:04:3,000
The object even has its own tutu. (Laughter)

79
0:04:31.198,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This little flouncy, spangly, bottomy bit

80
0:04:33.558,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that sits at the bottom of the vase.

81
0:04:35.593,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It reminded me, in an odd kind of way,

82
0:04:37.966,000 --> 0:04:39,000
of my niece's fifth birthday party.

83
0:04:40.065,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Where all the little girls would come either as a princess or a fairy.

84
0:04:44.587,000 --> 0:04:45,000
There was one who would come as a fairy princess.

85
0:04:46.468,000 --> 0:04:48,000
You should have seen the looks.

86
0:04:48.89,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:50.583,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And I realize that this object was in my mind,

88
0:04:53.925,000 --> 0:04:55,000
born from the same mind, from the same womb,

89
0:04:56.865,000 --> 0:05:01,000
practically, as Barbie Ballerina. (Laughter)

90
0:05:02.089,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And then there's the elephants. (Laughter)

91
0:05:05.611,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Those extraordinary elephants

92
0:05:07.757,000 --> 0:05:09,000
with their little, sort of strange, sinister expressions

93
0:05:10.481,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and Greta Garbo eyelashes, with these golden tusks and so on.

94
0:05:15.778,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I realized this was an elephant that had

95
0:05:17.554,000 --> 0:05:22,000
absolutely nothing to do with a majestic march across the Serengeti.

96
0:05:23.287,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It was a Dumbo nightmare. (Laughter)

97
0:05:28.782,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But something more profound was happening as well.

98
0:05:31.628,000 --> 0:05:32,000
These objects, it seemed to me,

99
0:05:33.057,000 --> 0:05:37,000
were quintessentially the kind that I and my liberal left friends in London

100
0:05:37.366,000 --> 0:05:39,000
had always seen as summing up

101
0:05:39.901,000 --> 0:05:41,000
something deplorable about the French aristocracy

102
0:05:42.74,000 --> 0:05:44,000
in the 18th century.

103
0:05:44.912,000 --> 0:05:46,000
The label had told me that these pieces were made

104
0:05:47.701,000 --> 0:05:49,000
by the Sèvres Manufactory,

105
0:05:50.412,000 --> 0:05:53,000
made of porcelain in the late 1750s,

106
0:05:53.637,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and designed by a designer called Jean-Claude Duplessis,

107
0:05:56.768,000 --> 0:05:58,000
actually somebody of extraordinary distinction

108
0:05:58.964,000 --> 0:06:,000
as I later learned.

109
0:06:01.441,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But for me, they summed up a kind of,

110
0:06:06.249,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that sort of sheer uselessness of the aristocracy

111
0:06:09.663,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in the 18th century.

112
0:06:13.136,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I and my colleagues had always thought

113
0:06:15.602,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that these objects, in way, summed up the idea of,

114
0:06:18.558,000 --> 0:06:2,000
you know -- no wonder there was a revolution.

115
0:06:20.922,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Or, indeed, thank God there was a revolution.

116
0:06:25.465,000 --> 0:06:26,000
There was a sort of idea really, that,

117
0:06:27.224,000 --> 0:06:29,000
if you owned a vase like this,

118
0:06:29.897,000 --> 0:06:32,000
then there was really only one fate possible.

119
0:06:33.621,000 --> 0:06:37,000
(Laughter)

120
0:06:37.685,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So, there I was -- in a sort of paroxysm of horror.

121
0:06:42.349,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But I took the job and I went on looking at these vases.

122
0:06:46.309,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I sort of had to because they're on a through route in the Met.

123
0:06:49.84,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So, almost anywhere I went, there they were.

124
0:06:52.472,000 --> 0:06:54,000
They had this kind of odd sort of fascination,

125
0:06:55.241,000 --> 0:06:58,000
like a car accident.

126
0:06:58.259,000 --> 0:07:,000
Where I couldn't stop looking.

127
0:07:00.983,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And as I did so, I started thinking:

128
0:07:03.205,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Well, what are we actually looking at here?

129
0:07:07.733,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And what I started with was understanding this

130
0:07:11.064,000 --> 0:07:14,000
as really a supreme piece of design.

131
0:07:14.616,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It took me a little time.

132
0:07:15.713,000 --> 0:07:16,000
But, that tutu for example --

133
0:07:17.151,000 --> 0:07:2,000
actually, this is a piece that does dance in its own way.

134
0:07:20.273,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It has an extraordinary lightness

135
0:07:21.915,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and yet, it is also amazing balanced.

136
0:07:24.43,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It has these kinds of sculptural ingredients.

137
0:07:27.905,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And then the play between --

138
0:07:29.544,000 --> 0:07:33,000
actually really quite carefully disposed color and gilding, and the sculptural surface,

139
0:07:34.156,000 --> 0:07:36,000
is really rather remarkable.

140
0:07:36.431,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And then I realized that this piece went into the kiln

141
0:07:39.261,000 --> 0:07:42,000
four times, at least four times in order to arrive at this.

142
0:07:42.651,000 --> 0:07:45,000
How many moments for accident can you think of

143
0:07:45.705,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that could have happened to this piece?

144
0:07:47.209,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And then remember, not just one, but two.

145
0:07:49.771,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So he's having to arrive at two exactly matched

146
0:07:54.036,000 --> 0:07:56,000
vases of this kind.

147
0:07:56.548,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And then this question of uselessness.

148
0:07:57.954,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Well actually, the end of the trunks were originally candle holders.

149
0:08:02.913,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So what you would have had were candles on either side.

150
0:08:06.663,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Imagine that effect of candlelight on that surface.

151
0:08:09.219,000 --> 0:08:11,000
On the slightly uneven pink, on the beautiful gold.

152
0:08:11.951,000 --> 0:08:13,000
It would have glittered in an interior,

153
0:08:14.697,000 --> 0:08:17,000
a little like a little firework.

154
0:08:17.779,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And at that point, actually, a firework went off in my brain.

155
0:08:21.431,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Somebody reminded me that, that word 'fancy' --

156
0:08:24.266,000 --> 0:08:27,000
which in a sense for me, encapsulated this object --

157
0:08:27.376,000 --> 0:08:31,000
actually comes from the same root as the word 'fantasy.'

158
0:08:31.422,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And that what this object was just as much in a way,

159
0:08:34.038,000 --> 0:08:36,000
in its own way, as a Leonardo da Vinci painting,

160
0:08:36.49,000 --> 0:08:38,000
is a portal to somewhere else.

161
0:08:38.697,000 --> 0:08:42,000
This is an object of the imagination.

162
0:08:42.892,000 --> 0:08:48,000
If you think about the mad 18th-century operas of the time -- set in the Orient.

163
0:08:49.721,000 --> 0:08:55,000
If you think about divans and perhaps even opium-induced visions of pink elephants,

164
0:08:56.2,000 --> 0:08:59,000
then at that point, this object starts to make sense.

165
0:08:59.501,000 --> 0:09:03,000
This is an object which is all about escapism.

166
0:09:03.557,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It's about an escapism that happens --

167
0:09:06.754,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that the aristocracy in France sought

168
0:09:08.775,000 --> 0:09:09,000
very deliberately

169
0:09:10.561,000 --> 0:09:14,000
to distinguish themselves from ordinary people.

170
0:09:15.129,000 --> 0:09:16,000
It's not an escapism that

171
0:09:17.093,000 --> 0:09:2,000
we feel particularly happy with today, however.

172
0:09:20.96,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And again, going on thinking about this,

173
0:09:23.945,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I realize that in a way we're all victims

174
0:09:27.119,000 --> 0:09:29,000
of a certain kind of tyranny

175
0:09:29.13,000 --> 0:09:31,000
of the triumph of modernism

176
0:09:31.151,000 --> 0:09:33,000
whereby form and function in an object

177
0:09:33.877,000 --> 0:09:36,000
have to follow one another, or are deemed to do so.

178
0:09:37.282,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And the extraneous ornament is seen as really,

179
0:09:40.246,000 --> 0:09:43,000
essentially, criminal.

180
0:09:43.266,000 --> 0:09:46,000
It's a triumph, in a way, of bourgeois values rather than aristocratic ones.

181
0:09:46.417,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And that seems fine.

182
0:09:48.24,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Except for the fact that it becomes a kind of sequestration of imagination.

183
0:09:55.697,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So just as in the 20th century, so many people

184
0:09:58.387,000 --> 0:09:59,000
had the idea that their faith

185
0:10:00.375,000 --> 0:10:02,000
took place on the Sabbath day,

186
0:10:03.057,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and the rest of their lives --

187
0:10:04.431,000 --> 0:10:07,000
their lives of washing machines and orthodontics --

188
0:10:08.409,000 --> 0:10:1,000
took place on another day.

189
0:10:10.441,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Then, I think we've started doing the same.

190
0:10:14.209,000 --> 0:10:17,000
We've allowed ourselves to

191
0:10:17.541,000 --> 0:10:19,000
lead our fantasy lives in front of screens.

192
0:10:19.898,000 --> 0:10:22,000
In the dark of the cinema, with the television in the corner of the room.

193
0:10:23.88,000 --> 0:10:27,000
We've eliminated, in a sense, that constant

194
0:10:27.958,000 --> 0:10:31,000
of the imagination that these vases represented in people's lives.

195
0:10:32.886,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So maybe it's time we got this back a little.

196
0:10:36.922,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I think it's beginning to happen.

197
0:10:39.272,000 --> 0:10:4,000
In London, for example,

198
0:10:40.538,000 --> 0:10:42,000
with these extraordinary buildings

199
0:10:42.687,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that have been appearing over the last few years.

200
0:10:45.678,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Redolent, in a sense, of science fiction,

201
0:10:48.081,000 --> 0:10:5,000
turning London into a kind of fantasy playground.

202
0:10:50.195,000 --> 0:10:54,000
It's actually amazing to look out of a high building nowadays there.

203
0:10:55.049,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But even then, there's a resistance.

204
0:10:56.853,000 --> 0:11:,000
London has called these buildings the Gherkin, the Shard, the Walkie Talkie --

205
0:11:01.189,000 --> 0:11:04,000
bringing these soaring buildings down to Earth.

206
0:11:04.494,000 --> 0:11:08,000
There's an idea that we don't want these

207
0:11:08.574,000 --> 0:11:12,000
anxious-making, imaginative journeys to happen in our daily lives.

208
0:11:13.435,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I feel lucky in a way,

209
0:11:16.703,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I've encountered this object.

210
0:11:19.251,000 --> 0:11:21,000
(Laughter)

211
0:11:21.692,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I found him on the Internet when I was looking up a reference.

212
0:11:24.994,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And there he was.

213
0:11:27.888,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And unlike the pink elephant vase,

214
0:11:31.202,000 --> 0:11:32,000
this was a kind of love at first sight.

215
0:11:33.175,000 --> 0:11:35,000
In fact, reader, I married him. I bought him.

216
0:11:36.031,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And he now adorns my office.

217
0:11:39.895,000 --> 0:11:42,000
He's a Staffordshire figure made in the middle of the 19th century.

218
0:11:43.436,000 --> 0:11:47,000
He represents the actor, Edmund Kean, playing Shakespeare's Richard III.

219
0:11:48.242,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And it's based, actually, on a more elevated piece of porcelain.

220
0:11:50.695,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So I loved, on an art historical level,

221
0:11:52.849,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I loved that layered quality that he has.

222
0:11:57.509,000 --> 0:11:59,000
But more than that, I love him.

223
0:12:00.002,000 --> 0:12:01,000
In a way that I think would have been impossible

224
0:12:01.68,000 --> 0:12:03,000
without the pink Sèvres vase in my Leonardo days.

225
0:12:04.292,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I love his orange and pink breeches.

226
0:12:07.509,000 --> 0:12:09,000
I love the fact that he seems to be going off to war,

227
0:12:10.259,000 --> 0:12:14,000
having just finished the washing up. (Laughter)

228
0:12:14.691,000 --> 0:12:16,000
He seems also to have forgotten his sword.

229
0:12:17.168,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I love his pink little cheeks, his munchkin energy.

230
0:12:19.787,000 --> 0:12:22,000
In a way, he's become my sort of alter ego.

231
0:12:22.978,000 --> 0:12:24,000
He's, I hope, a little bit dignified,

232
0:12:25.279,000 --> 0:12:3,000
but mostly rather vulgar. (Laughter)

233
0:12:30.453,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And energetic, I hope, too.

234
0:12:33.671,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I let him into my life because the Sèvres pink elephant vase allowed me to do so.

235
0:12:38.826,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And before that Leonardo,

236
0:12:40.394,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I understood that this object could become part of a journey for me every day,

237
0:12:45.5,000 --> 0:12:47,000
sitting in my office.

238
0:12:48.245,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I really hope that others, all of you,

239
0:12:51.234,000 --> 0:12:52,000
visiting objects in the museum,

240
0:12:52.809,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and taking them home and finding them for yourselves,

241
0:12:55.263,000 --> 0:12:59,000
will allow those objects to flourish in your imaginative lives.

242
0:12:59.577,000 --> 0:13:,000
Thank you very much.

243
0:13:01.13,000 --> 0:13:04,000
(Applause)

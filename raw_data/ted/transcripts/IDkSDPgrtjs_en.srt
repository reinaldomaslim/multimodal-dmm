1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So I want to take you on a trip

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to an alien world.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And it's not a trip

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that requires light-years of travel,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
but it's to a place

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
where it's defined by light.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So it's a little-appreciated fact

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that most of the animals in our ocean

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
make light.

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I've spent most of my career

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence.

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I study it because I think understanding it

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
is critical to understanding life in the ocean

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
where most bioluminescence occurs.

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I also use it as a tool

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
for visualizing and tracking pollution.

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
But mostly I'm entranced by it.

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Since my my first dive in a deep-diving submersible,

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
when I went down and turned out the lights

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and saw the fireworks displays,

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I've been a bioluminescence junky.

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But I would come back from those dives

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and try to share the experience with words,

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and they were totally inadequate to the task.

25
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I needed some way to share the experience directly.

26
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And the first time I figured out that way

27
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
was in this little single-person submersible

28
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
called Deep Rover.

29
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
This next video clip,

30
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
you're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence.

31
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And the first thing you're going to see

32
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is a transect screen

33
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that is about a meter across.

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Video) Narrator: In front of the sub,

35
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
a mess screen will come into contact

36
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
with the soft-bodied creatures of the deep sea.

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
With the sub's lights switched off,

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
it is possible to see their bioluminescence --

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
the light produced when they collide with the mesh.

40
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
This is the first time

41
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
it has ever been recorded.

42
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Edith Widder: So I recorded that with an intensified video camera

43
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that has about the sensitivity

44
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
of the fully dark-adapted human eye.

45
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Which means that really is what you would see

46
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
if you took a dive in a submersible.

47
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But just to try to prove that fact to you,

48
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I've brought along some bioluminescent plankton

49
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt

50
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
at a live demonstration.

51
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So, if we could have the lights down

53
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and have it as dark in here as possible,

54
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I have a flask

55
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that has bioluminescent plankton in it.

56
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And you'll note there's no light coming from them right now,

57
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
either because they're dead --

58
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
or because I need to stir them up in some way

60
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like.

61
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Gasps)

62
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Oops. Sorry.

63
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I spend most of my time working in the dark; I'm used to that.

65
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Okay.

66
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So that light

67
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate,

68
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
a single-celled alga.

69
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So why would a single-celled alga

70
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
need to be able to produce light?

71
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Well, it uses it to defend itself from its predators.

72
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
The flash is like a scream for help.

73
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm,

74
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and just like the alarm on your car or your house,

75
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder,

76
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
thereby either leading to his capture

77
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
or scaring him away.

78
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
There's a lot of animals that use this trick,

79
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
for example this black dragonfish.

80
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It's got a light organ under its eye.

81
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It's got a chin barbel.

82
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It's got a lot of other light organs you can't see, but you'll see in here in a minute.

83
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime,

84
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
because the top speed of this fish is one knot,

85
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
which was the top speed of the submersible.

86
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But it was worth it,

87
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
because we caught it in a special capture device,

88
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
brought it up into the lab on the ship,

89
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and then everything on this fish lights up.

90
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
It's unbelievable.

91
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
The light organs under the eyes are flashing.

92
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
That chin barbel is flashing.

93
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It's got light organs on its belly that are flashing,

94
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
fin lights.

95
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It's a scream for help; it's meant to attract attention.

96
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It's phenomenal.

97
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And you normally don't get to see this

98
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
because we've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets.

99
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
There's other ways you can defend yourself with light.

100
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
For example, this shrimp

101
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water

102
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud.

103
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
This blinds or distracts the predator.

104
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
This little squid is called the fire shooter

105
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
because of its ability to do this.

106
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Now it may look like a tasty morsel,

107
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
or a pig's head with wings --

108
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Laughter)

109
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
but if it's attacked,

110
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
it puts out a barrage of light --

111
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
in fact, a barrage of photon torpedoes.

112
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I just barely got the lights out in time

113
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
for you to be able to see those gobs of light

114
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
hitting the transect screen

115
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and then just glowing.

116
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It's phenomenal.

117
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So there's a lot of animals in the open ocean --

118
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
most of them that make light.

119
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And we have a pretty good idea, for most of them, why.

120
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
They use it for finding food, for attracting mates,

121
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
for defending against predators.

122
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
But when you get down to the bottom of the ocean,

123
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that's where things get really strange.

124
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And some of these animals

125
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
are probably inspiration for the things you saw in "Avatar,"

126
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but you don't have to travel to Pandora to see them.

127
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
They're things like this.

128
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
This is a golden coral, a bush.

129
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
It grows very slowly.

130
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
In fact, it's thought that some of these

131
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
are as much as 3,000 years old,

132
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed.

133
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
The other reason is this amazing bush glows.

134
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So if you brush up against it,

135
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
any place you brushed against it,

136
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
you get this twinkling blue-green light

137
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that's just breathtaking.

138
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And you see things like this.

139
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
This looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss book --

140
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
just all manner of creatures all over this thing.

141
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And these are flytrap anemones.

142
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Now if you poke it, it pulls in its tentacles.

143
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
But if you keep poking it,

144
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
it starts to produce light.

145
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy.

146
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It produces these strings of light,

147
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
presumably as some form of defense.

148
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
There are starfish that can make light.

149
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And there are brittle stars that produce bands of light

150
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that dance along their arms.

151
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
This looks like a plant,

152
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
but it's actually an animal.

153
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And it anchors itself in the sand

154
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock.

155
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So it can actually hold itself in very strong currents,

156
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
as you see here.

157
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But if we collect it very gently, and we bring it up into the lab

158
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and just squeeze it at the base of the stock,

159
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
it produces this light

160
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that propagates from stem to the plume,

161
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
changing color as it goes,

162
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
from green to blue.

163
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Colorization and sound effects

164
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
added for you viewing pleasure.

165
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
(Laughter)

166
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But we have no idea why it does that.

167
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Here's another one. This is also a sea pen.

168
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It's got a brittle star hitching a ride.

169
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
It's a green saber of light.

170
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And like the one you just saw,

171
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
it can produce these as bands of light.

172
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So if I squeeze the base,

173
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
the bands go from base to tip.

174
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
If I squeeze the tip, they go from tip to base.

175
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle?

176
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
(Gasps)

177
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I'd be very interested in your theories about what that's about.

178
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Laughter)

179
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So there's a language of light in the deep ocean,

180
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and we're just beginning to understand it,

181
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and one way we're going about that

182
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
is we're imitating a lot of these displays.

183
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
This is an optical lure that I've used.

184
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
We call it the electronic jellyfish.

185
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It's just 16 blue LEDs

186
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that we can program to do different types of displays.

187
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And we view it with a camera system I developed called Eye-in-the-Sea

188
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that uses far red light that's invisible to most animals,

189
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
so it's unobtrusive.

190
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So I just want to show you

191
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
some of the responses we've elicited

192
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
from animals in the deep sea.

193
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So the camera's black and white.

194
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It's not high-resolution.

195
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And what you're seeing here is a bait box

196
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
with a bunch of -- like the cockroaches of the ocean --

197
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
there are isopods all over it.

198
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And right in the front

199
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
is the electronic jellyfish.

200
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And when it starts flashing,

201
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
it's just going to be one of the LEDs that's flashing very fast.

202
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
But as soon as it starts to flash --

203
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and it's going to look big, because it blooms on the camera --

204
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I want you to look right here.

205
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
There's something small there that responds.

206
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
We're talking to something.

207
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
It looks like a little of string pearls basically --

208
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
in fact, three strings of pearls.

209
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And this was very consistent.

210
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
This was in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet.

211
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
We basically have a chat room going on here,

212
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
because once it gets started, everybody's talking.

213
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And I think this is actually a shrimp

214
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
that's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water.

215
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
But the cool thing is, we're talking to it.

216
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We don't know what we're saying.

217
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Personally, I think it's something sexy.

218
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
(Laughter)

219
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And then finally,

220
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I want to show you some responses that we recorded

221
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
with the world's first deep-sea webcam,

222
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year.

223
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
We've only just begun to analyze all of this data.

224
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
This is going to be a glowing source first,

225
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
which is like bioluminescent bacteria.

226
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And it is an optical cue

227
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that there's carrion on the bottom of the ocean.

228
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So this scavenger comes in,

229
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
which is a giant sixgill shark.

230
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And I can't claim for sure

231
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that the optical source brought it in, because there's bait right there.

232
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
But if it had been following the odor plume,

233
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
it would have come in from the other direction.

234
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And it does actually seem to be trying

235
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to eat the electronic jellyfish.

236
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
That's a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark.

237
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Okay, so this next one is from the webcam,

238
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and it's going to be this pinwheel display.

239
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And this is a burglar alarm.

240
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And that was a Humboldt squid,

241
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
a juvenile Humboldt squid, about three feet long.

242
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
This is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon.

243
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But if it's a burglar alarm, you wouldn't expect it to attack the jellyfish directly.

244
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
It's supposed to be attacking what's attacking the jellyfish.

245
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But we did see a bunch of responses like this.

246
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
This guy is a little more contemplative.

247
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
"Hey, wait a minute.

248
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
There's supposed to be something else there."

249
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
He's thinking about it.

250
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But he's persistent.

251
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
He keeps coming back.

252
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And then he goes away for a few seconds

253
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
to think about it some more,

254
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and thinks,

255
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
"Maybe if I come in from a different angle."

256
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
(Laughter)

257
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Nope.

258
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So we are starting to get a handle on this,

259
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
but only just the beginnings.

260
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
We need more eyes on the process.

261
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible,

262
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
by all means, climb in and take the plunge.

263
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
This is something that should be on everybody's bucket list,

264
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
because we live on an ocean planet.

265
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
More than 90 percent, 99 percent,

266
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
of the living space on our planet

267
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
is ocean.

268
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It's a magical place

269
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
filled with breathtaking light shows

270
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and bizarre and wondrous creatures,

271
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
alien life forms

272
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
that you don't have to travel to another planet to see.

273
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
But if you do take the plunge,

274
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
please remember to turn out the lights.

275
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
But I warn you,

276
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
it's addictive.

277
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Thank you.

278
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.342,000 --> 0:00:14,000
For a long time in my life,

2
0:00:15.101,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I felt like I'd been living two different lives.

3
0:00:19.692,000 --> 0:00:22,000
There's the life that everyone sees,

4
0:00:23.097,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and then there's the life that only I see.

5
0:00:26.804,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And in the life that everyone sees,

6
0:00:29.324,000 --> 0:00:31,000
who I am is a friend,

7
0:00:31.798,000 --> 0:00:33,000
a son, a brother,

8
0:00:34.353,000 --> 0:00:37,000
a stand-up comedian and a teenager.

9
0:00:37.979,000 --> 0:00:38,000
That's the life everyone sees.

10
0:00:39.82,000 --> 0:00:4,000
If you were to ask my friends and family to describe me,

11
0:00:41.346,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that's what they would tell you.

12
0:00:43.185,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And that's a huge part of me. That is who I am.

13
0:00:45.183,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And if you were to ask me to describe myself,

14
0:00:47.993,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I'd probably say some of those same things.

15
0:00:50.915,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And I wouldn't be lying,

16
0:00:54.476,000 --> 0:00:57,000
but I wouldn't totally be telling you the truth, either,

17
0:00:58.006,000 --> 0:00:59,000
because the truth is,

18
0:00:59.533,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that's just the life everyone else sees.

19
0:01:02.705,000 --> 0:01:05,000
In the life that only I see, who I am,

20
0:01:06.468,000 --> 0:01:07,000
who I really am,

21
0:01:08.395,000 --> 0:01:12,000
is someone who struggles intensely with depression.

22
0:01:12.83,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I have for the last six years of my life,

23
0:01:15.507,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and I continue to every day.

24
0:01:20.626,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Now, for someone who has never experienced depression

25
0:01:23.123,000 --> 0:01:24,000
or doesn't really know what that means,

26
0:01:24.325,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that might surprise them to hear,

27
0:01:25.708,000 --> 0:01:26,000
because there's this pretty popular misconception

28
0:01:27.613,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that depression is just being sad

29
0:01:30.36,000 --> 0:01:32,000
when something in your life goes wrong,

30
0:01:32.848,000 --> 0:01:33,000
when you break up with your girlfriend,

31
0:01:34.49,000 --> 0:01:35,000
when you lose a loved one,

32
0:01:35.881,000 --> 0:01:36,000
when you don't get the job you wanted.

33
0:01:37.632,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But that's sadness. That's a natural thing.

34
0:01:39.619,000 --> 0:01:4,000
That's a natural human emotion.

35
0:01:41.531,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Real depression isn't being sad

36
0:01:45.729,000 --> 0:01:47,000
when something in your life goes wrong.

37
0:01:48.358,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Real depression is being sad

38
0:01:50.144,000 --> 0:01:53,000
when everything in your life is going right.

39
0:01:53.413,000 --> 0:01:55,000
That's real depression, and that's what I suffer from.

40
0:01:55.898,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And to be totally honest,

41
0:01:58.023,000 --> 0:02:,000
that's hard for me to stand up here and say.

42
0:02:00.837,000 --> 0:02:01,000
It's hard for me to talk about,

43
0:02:02.558,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about,

44
0:02:05.321,000 --> 0:02:07,000
so much so that no one's talking about it.

45
0:02:07.689,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And no one's talking about depression, but we need to be,

46
0:02:10.083,000 --> 0:02:13,000
because right now it's a massive problem.

47
0:02:13.825,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's a massive problem.

48
0:02:15.495,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But we don't see it on social media, right?

49
0:02:17.297,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We don't see it on Facebook. We don't see it on Twitter.

50
0:02:19.385,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We don't see it on the news, because it's not happy,

51
0:02:21.207,000 --> 0:02:22,000
it's not fun, it's not light.

52
0:02:22.836,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And so because we don't see it, we don't see the severity of it.

53
0:02:26.431,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this:

54
0:02:30.19,000 --> 0:02:31,000
every 30 seconds,

55
0:02:31.913,000 --> 0:02:33,000
every 30 seconds, somewhere,

56
0:02:34.117,000 --> 0:02:36,000
someone in the world takes their own life

57
0:02:36.31,000 --> 0:02:37,000
because of depression,

58
0:02:37.387,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and it might be two blocks away, it might be two countries away,

59
0:02:39.627,000 --> 0:02:4,000
it might be two continents away, but it's happening,

60
0:02:41.157,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and it's happening every single day.

61
0:02:43.727,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And we have a tendency, as a society,

62
0:02:46.691,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to look at that and go, "So what?"

63
0:02:51.937,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So what? We look at that, and we go, "That's your problem.

64
0:02:56.592,000 --> 0:02:58,000
That's their problem."

65
0:02:58.995,000 --> 0:02:59,000
We say we're sad and we say we're sorry,

66
0:03:00.847,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but we also say, "So what?"

67
0:03:02.224,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Well, two years ago it was my problem,

68
0:03:06.907,000 --> 0:03:1,000
because I sat on the edge of my bed

69
0:03:10.964,000 --> 0:03:13,000
where I'd sat a million times before

70
0:03:14.324,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and I was suicidal.

71
0:03:17.14,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I was suicidal, and if you were to look at my life on the surface,

72
0:03:21.066,000 --> 0:03:23,000
you wouldn't see a kid who was suicidal.

73
0:03:23.308,000 --> 0:03:25,000
You'd see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team,

74
0:03:25.424,000 --> 0:03:27,000
the drama and theater student of the year,

75
0:03:27.485,000 --> 0:03:27,000
the English student of the year,

76
0:03:28.444,000 --> 0:03:29,000
someone who was consistently on the honor roll

77
0:03:30.272,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and consistently at every party.

78
0:03:33.945,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So you would say I wasn't depressed, you would say

79
0:03:35.586,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I wasn't suicidal, but you would be wrong.

80
0:03:38.297,000 --> 0:03:39,000
You would be wrong. So I sat there that night

81
0:03:39.736,000 --> 0:03:43,000
beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand

82
0:03:43.774,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and I thought about taking my own life

83
0:03:45.762,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and I came this close to doing it.

84
0:03:49.114,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I came this close to doing it.

85
0:03:50.796,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And I didn't, so that makes me one of the lucky ones,

86
0:03:53.924,000 --> 0:03:55,000
one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge

87
0:03:56.059,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and look down but not jump,

88
0:03:58.32,000 --> 0:04:,000
one of the lucky ones who survives.

89
0:04:00.325,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Well, I survived, and that just leaves me with my story,

90
0:04:02.722,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and my story is this:

91
0:04:05.127,000 --> 0:04:08,000
In four simple words, I suffer from depression.

92
0:04:08.48,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I suffer from depression,

93
0:04:10.91,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and for a long time, I think,

94
0:04:18.23,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I was living two totally different lives,

95
0:04:20.826,000 --> 0:04:21,000
where one person was always afraid of the other.

96
0:04:22.687,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I was afraid that people would see me for who I really was,

97
0:04:24.786,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that I wasn't the perfect, popular kid in high school everyone thought I was,

98
0:04:28.028,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that beneath my smile, there was struggle,

99
0:04:30.453,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and beneath my light, there was dark,

100
0:04:32.416,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain.

101
0:04:36.793,000 --> 0:04:38,000
See, some people might fear girls not liking them back.

102
0:04:39.43,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Some people might fear sharks. Some people might fear death.

103
0:04:41.519,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But for me, for a large part of my life, I feared myself.

104
0:04:46.212,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I feared my truth, I feared my honesty, I feared my vulnerability,

105
0:04:48.904,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and that fear made me feel

106
0:04:51.126,000 --> 0:04:53,000
like I was forced into a corner,

107
0:04:53.483,000 --> 0:04:56,000
like I was forced into a corner and there was only one way out,

108
0:04:56.513,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and so I thought about that way every single day.

109
0:05:00.306,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I thought about it every single day,

110
0:05:01.753,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and if I'm being totally honest, standing here

111
0:05:03.424,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I've thought about it again since, because that's the sickness,

112
0:05:06.797,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that's the struggle, that's depression,

113
0:05:08.731,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and depression isn't chicken pox.

114
0:05:09.95,000 --> 0:05:1,000
You don't beat it once and it's gone forever.

115
0:05:11.668,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It's something you live with. It's something you live in.

116
0:05:14.431,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It's the roommate you can't kick out. It's the voice you can't ignore.

117
0:05:18.003,000 --> 0:05:2,000
It's the feelings you can't seem to escape,

118
0:05:20.264,000 --> 0:05:25,000
the scariest part is that after a while,

119
0:05:25.337,000 --> 0:05:27,000
you become numb to it. It becomes normal for you,

120
0:05:28.217,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and what you really fear the most

121
0:05:30.504,000 --> 0:05:32,000
isn't the suffering inside of you.

122
0:05:33.36,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's the stigma inside of others,

123
0:05:34.876,000 --> 0:05:36,000
it's the shame, it's the embarrassment,

124
0:05:37.157,000 --> 0:05:39,000
it's the disapproving look on a friend's face,

125
0:05:39.61,000 --> 0:05:42,000
it's the whispers in the hallway that you're weak,

126
0:05:43.074,000 --> 0:05:44,000
it's the comments that you're crazy.

127
0:05:44.475,000 --> 0:05:46,000
That's what keeps you from getting help.

128
0:05:46.575,000 --> 0:05:48,000
That's what makes you hold it in and hide it.

129
0:05:49.569,000 --> 0:05:51,000
It's the stigma. So you hold it in and you hide it,

130
0:05:51.904,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and you hold it in and you hide it,

131
0:05:53.766,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and even though it's keeping you in bed every day

132
0:05:55.442,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and it's making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it,

133
0:05:58.382,000 --> 0:06:,000
you hide it, because the stigma in our society

134
0:06:00.545,000 --> 0:06:02,000
around depression is very real.

135
0:06:03.46,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It's very real, and if you think that it isn't, ask yourself this:

136
0:06:06.662,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Would you rather make your next Facebook status

137
0:06:08.471,000 --> 0:06:09,000
say you're having a tough time getting out of bed

138
0:06:10.217,000 --> 0:06:12,000
because you hurt your back

139
0:06:12.366,000 --> 0:06:13,000
or you're having a tough time getting out of bed every morning

140
0:06:14.358,000 --> 0:06:16,000
because you're depressed?

141
0:06:16.458,000 --> 0:06:18,000
That's the stigma, because unfortunately,

142
0:06:18.742,000 --> 0:06:2,000
we live in a world where if you break your arm,

143
0:06:21.21,000 --> 0:06:23,000
everyone runs over to sign your cast,

144
0:06:23.899,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but if you tell people you're depressed, everyone runs the other way.

145
0:06:26.7,000 --> 0:06:28,000
That's the stigma.

146
0:06:29.2,000 --> 0:06:33,000
We are so, so, so accepting of any body part breaking down

147
0:06:34.166,000 --> 0:06:37,000
other than our brains. And that's ignorance.

148
0:06:37.268,000 --> 0:06:39,000
That's pure ignorance, and that ignorance has created

149
0:06:39.28,000 --> 0:06:4,000
a world that doesn't understand depression,

150
0:06:40.844,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that doesn't understand mental health.

151
0:06:43.35,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And that's ironic to me, because depression

152
0:06:45.303,000 --> 0:06:47,000
is one of the best documented problems we have in the world,

153
0:06:47.813,000 --> 0:06:49,000
yet it's one of the least discussed.

154
0:06:49.858,000 --> 0:06:51,000
We just push it aside and put it in a corner

155
0:06:52.294,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and pretend it's not there and hope it'll fix itself.

156
0:06:55.881,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Well, it won't. It hasn't, and it's not going to,

157
0:06:59.223,000 --> 0:07:,000
because that's wishful thinking,

158
0:07:01.114,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and wishful thinking isn't a game plan, it's procrastination,

159
0:07:03.887,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and we can't procrastinate on something this important.

160
0:07:08.816,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The first step in solving any problem

161
0:07:12.207,000 --> 0:07:13,000
is recognizing there is one.

162
0:07:13.69,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Well, we haven't done that, so we can't really expect

163
0:07:16.448,000 --> 0:07:19,000
to find an answer when we're still afraid of the question.

164
0:07:19.633,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And I don't know what the solution is.

165
0:07:23.412,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I wish I did, but I don't -- but I think,

166
0:07:25.873,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I think it has to start here.

167
0:07:27.881,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It has to start with me, it has to start with you,

168
0:07:30.28,000 --> 0:07:33,000
it has to start with the people who are suffering,

169
0:07:33.698,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the ones who are hidden in the shadows.

170
0:07:35.115,000 --> 0:07:37,000
We need to speak up and shatter the silence.

171
0:07:37.115,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We need to be the ones who are brave for what we believe in,

172
0:07:39.434,000 --> 0:07:42,000
because if there's one thing that I've come to realize,

173
0:07:42.609,000 --> 0:07:45,000
if there's one thing that I see as the biggest problem,

174
0:07:46.185,000 --> 0:07:49,000
it's not in building a world

175
0:07:49.224,000 --> 0:07:52,000
where we eliminate the ignorance of others.

176
0:07:52.973,000 --> 0:07:55,000
It's in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves,

177
0:07:56.259,000 --> 0:07:57,000
where we're okay with who we are,

178
0:07:57.46,000 --> 0:07:58,000
because when we get honest,

179
0:07:58.96,000 --> 0:08:,000
we see that we all struggle and we all suffer.

180
0:08:01.756,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Whether it's with this, whether it's with something else,

181
0:08:03.708,000 --> 0:08:05,000
we all know what it is to hurt.

182
0:08:06.535,000 --> 0:08:07,000
We all know what it is to have pain in our heart,

183
0:08:08.373,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and we all know how important it is to heal.

184
0:08:11.067,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But right now, depression is society's deep cut

185
0:08:14.461,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that we're content to put a Band-Aid over and pretend it's not there.

186
0:08:17.022,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Well, it is there. It is there, and you know what? It's okay.

187
0:08:21.526,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Depression is okay. If you're going through it, know that you're okay.

188
0:08:25.337,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And know that you're sick, you're not weak,

189
0:08:27.999,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and it's an issue, not an identity,

190
0:08:29.935,000 --> 0:08:31,000
because when you get past the fear and the ridicule

191
0:08:32.688,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and the judgment and the stigma of others,

192
0:08:34.485,000 --> 0:08:36,000
you can see depression for what it really is,

193
0:08:37.471,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and that's just a part of life,

194
0:08:39.71,000 --> 0:08:42,000
just a part of life, and as much as I hate,

195
0:08:43.438,000 --> 0:08:45,000
as much as I hate some of the places,

196
0:08:45.917,000 --> 0:08:48,000
some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to,

197
0:08:49.013,000 --> 0:08:51,000
in a lot of ways I'm grateful for it.

198
0:08:51.548,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Because yeah, it's put me in the valleys,

199
0:08:53.36,000 --> 0:08:54,000
but only to show me there's peaks,

200
0:08:54.792,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and yeah it's dragged me through the dark

201
0:08:56.391,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but only to remind me there is light.

202
0:08:58.977,000 --> 0:09:01,000
My pain, more than anything in 19 years on this planet,

203
0:09:02.72,000 --> 0:09:04,000
has given me perspective, and my hurt,

204
0:09:04.979,000 --> 0:09:06,000
my hurt has forced me to have hope,

205
0:09:07.474,000 --> 0:09:09,000
have hope and to have faith, faith in myself,

206
0:09:10.005,000 --> 0:09:12,000
faith in others, faith that it can get better,

207
0:09:12.55,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that we can change this, that we can speak up

208
0:09:14.628,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and speak out and fight back against ignorance,

209
0:09:17.386,000 --> 0:09:19,000
fight back against intolerance,

210
0:09:19.975,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and more than anything,

211
0:09:21.99,000 --> 0:09:23,000
learn to love ourselves,

212
0:09:24.716,000 --> 0:09:26,000
learn to accept ourselves for who we are,

213
0:09:26.895,000 --> 0:09:3,000
the people we are, not the people the world wants us to be.

214
0:09:30.99,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Because the world I believe in is one

215
0:09:32.602,000 --> 0:09:36,000
where embracing your light doesn't mean ignoring your dark.

216
0:09:36.77,000 --> 0:09:38,000
The world I believe in is one where we're measured

217
0:09:38.851,000 --> 0:09:42,000
by our ability to overcome adversities, not avoid them.

218
0:09:43.367,000 --> 0:09:47,000
The world I believe in is one where I can look someone in the eye

219
0:09:47.591,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and say, "I'm going through hell,"

220
0:09:49.353,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and they can look back at me and go, "Me too," and that's okay,

221
0:09:52.93,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and it's okay because depression is okay. We're people.

222
0:09:56.632,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We're people, and we struggle and we suffer

223
0:09:59.062,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and we bleed and we cry, and if you think that true strength

224
0:10:01.79,000 --> 0:10:03,000
means never showing any weakness, then I'm here

225
0:10:03.909,000 --> 0:10:06,000
to tell you you're wrong.

226
0:10:07.155,000 --> 0:10:1,000
You're wrong, because it's the opposite.

227
0:10:11.052,000 --> 0:10:13,000
We're people, and we have problems.

228
0:10:13.736,000 --> 0:10:14,000
We're not perfect, and that's okay.

229
0:10:15.407,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So we need to stop the ignorance,

230
0:10:17.621,000 --> 0:10:2,000
stop the intolerance, stop the stigma,

231
0:10:20.699,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and stop the silence, and we need to take away the taboos,

232
0:10:25.273,000 --> 0:10:29,000
take a look at the truth, and start talking,

233
0:10:29.812,000 --> 0:10:33,000
because the only way we're going to beat a problem

234
0:10:34.536,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that people are battling alone

235
0:10:37.87,000 --> 0:10:4,000
is by standing strong together,

236
0:10:41.633,000 --> 0:10:44,000
by standing strong together.

237
0:10:45.397,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And I believe that we can.

238
0:10:48.376,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I believe that we can. Thank you guys so much.

239
0:10:50.295,000 --> 0:10:52,000
This is a dream come true. Thank you. (Applause)

240
0:10:52.702,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Thank you. (Applause)

2
0:00:12.496,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Writing biography is a strange thing to do.

3
0:00:18.216,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It's a journey into the foreign territory

4
0:00:20.899,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of somebody else's life,

5
0:00:24.095,000 --> 0:00:26,000
a journey, an exploration that can take you places

6
0:00:26.768,000 --> 0:00:28,000
you never dreamed of going

7
0:00:29.039,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and still can't quite believe you've been,

8
0:00:31.264,000 --> 0:00:34,000
especially if, like me, you're an agnostic Jew

9
0:00:34.992,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and the life you've been exploring

10
0:00:36.817,000 --> 0:00:4,000
is that of Muhammad.

11
0:00:41.649,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Five years ago, for instance,

12
0:00:44.08,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I found myself waking each morning in misty Seattle

13
0:00:47.348,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to what I knew was an impossible question:

14
0:00:50.831,000 --> 0:00:53,000
What actually happened

15
0:00:54.049,000 --> 0:00:55,000
one desert night,

16
0:00:55.488,000 --> 0:00:58,000
half the world and almost half of history away?

17
0:00:59.082,000 --> 0:01:,000
What happened, that is,

18
0:01:00.802,000 --> 0:01:02,000
on the night in the year 610

19
0:01:03.12,000 --> 0:01:06,000
when Muhammad received the first revelation of the Koran

20
0:01:06.971,000 --> 0:01:1,000
on a mountain just outside Mecca?

21
0:01:11.048,000 --> 0:01:15,000
This is the core mystical moment of Islam,

22
0:01:15.653,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and as such, of course,

23
0:01:17.019,000 --> 0:01:2,000
it defies empirical analysis.

24
0:01:20.095,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Yet the question wouldn't let go of me.

25
0:01:24.2,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I was fully aware that for someone as secular as I am,

26
0:01:27.384,000 --> 0:01:28,000
just asking it could be seen

27
0:01:29.263,000 --> 0:01:32,000
as pure chutzpah.

28
0:01:32.523,000 --> 0:01:34,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:35.205,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And I plead guilty as charged,

30
0:01:37.816,000 --> 0:01:41,000
because all exploration, physical or intellectual,

31
0:01:41.847,000 --> 0:01:44,000
is inevitably in some sense an act of transgression,

32
0:01:45.724,000 --> 0:01:48,000
of crossing boundaries.

33
0:01:49.121,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Still, some boundaries are larger than others.

34
0:01:55.136,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So a human encountering the divine,

35
0:01:58.056,000 --> 0:02:01,000
as Muslims believe Muhammad did,

36
0:02:01.178,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to the rationalist, this is a matter not of fact

37
0:02:04.019,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but of wishful fiction,

38
0:02:05.776,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and like all of us, I like to think of myself as rational.

39
0:02:09.714,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Which might be why when I looked at the earliest accounts

40
0:02:12.598,000 --> 0:02:13,000
we have of that night,

41
0:02:14.375,000 --> 0:02:16,000
what struck me even more than what happened

42
0:02:17.194,000 --> 0:02:22,000
was what did not happen.

43
0:02:22.716,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Muhammad did not come floating off the mountain

44
0:02:25.868,000 --> 0:02:27,000
as though walking on air.

45
0:02:28.818,000 --> 0:02:3,000
He did not run down shouting, "Hallelujah!"

46
0:02:31.292,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and "Bless the Lord!"

47
0:02:33.652,000 --> 0:02:36,000
He did not radiate light and joy.

48
0:02:37.38,000 --> 0:02:38,000
There were no choirs of angels,

49
0:02:38.959,000 --> 0:02:41,000
no music of the spheres, no elation, no ecstasy,

50
0:02:42.259,000 --> 0:02:45,000
no golden aura surrounding him,

51
0:02:45.921,000 --> 0:02:49,000
no sense of an absolute, fore-ordained role

52
0:02:50.063,000 --> 0:02:53,000
as the messenger of God.

53
0:02:53.139,000 --> 0:02:55,000
That is, he did none of the things

54
0:02:56.094,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that might make it easy to cry foul,

55
0:02:58.848,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to put down the whole story as a pious fable.

56
0:03:03.995,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Quite the contrary.

57
0:03:06.827,000 --> 0:03:09,000
In his own reported words,

58
0:03:10.572,000 --> 0:03:12,000
he was convinced at first

59
0:03:12.949,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that what had happened couldn't have been real.

60
0:03:18.23,000 --> 0:03:2,000
At best, he thought, it had to have been a hallucination --

61
0:03:20.942,000 --> 0:03:21,000
a trick of the eye or the ear, perhaps,

62
0:03:22.751,000 --> 0:03:24,000
or his own mind working against him.

63
0:03:24.926,000 --> 0:03:26,000
At worst, possession --

64
0:03:27.103,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that he'd been seized by an evil jinn,

65
0:03:29.392,000 --> 0:03:3,000
a spirit out to deceive him,

66
0:03:31.183,000 --> 0:03:34,000
even to crush the life out of him.

67
0:03:34.192,000 --> 0:03:37,000
In fact, he was so sure that he could only be majnun,

68
0:03:37.216,000 --> 0:03:38,000
possessed by a jinn,

69
0:03:38.844,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that when he found himself still alive,

70
0:03:40.956,000 --> 0:03:44,000
his first impulse was to finish the job himself,

71
0:03:45.805,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to leap off the highest cliff

72
0:03:48.008,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and escape the terror of what he'd experienced

73
0:03:52.126,000 --> 0:03:59,000
by putting an end to all experience.

74
0:03:59.228,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So the man who fled down the mountain that night

75
0:04:02.148,000 --> 0:04:04,000
trembled not with joy

76
0:04:04.599,000 --> 0:04:08,000
but with a stark, primordial fear.

77
0:04:09.319,000 --> 0:04:14,000
He was overwhelmed not with conviction, but by doubt.

78
0:04:15.239,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And that panicked disorientation,

79
0:04:18.04,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that sundering of everything familiar,

80
0:04:20.919,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that daunting awareness of something

81
0:04:24.603,000 --> 0:04:26,000
beyond human comprehension,

82
0:04:27.512,000 --> 0:04:33,000
can only be called a terrible awe.

83
0:04:34.087,000 --> 0:04:37,000
This might be somewhat difficult to grasp

84
0:04:37.301,000 --> 0:04:39,000
now that we use the word "awesome"

85
0:04:39.839,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to describe a new app or a viral video.

86
0:04:44.018,000 --> 0:04:47,000
With the exception perhaps of a massive earthquake,

87
0:04:47.223,000 --> 0:04:49,000
we're protected from real awe.

88
0:04:49.871,000 --> 0:04:5,000
We close the doors and hunker down,

89
0:04:51.759,000 --> 0:04:53,000
convinced that we're in control,

90
0:04:54.305,000 --> 0:04:57,000
or, at least, hoping for control.

91
0:04:57.327,000 --> 0:04:58,000
We do our best to ignore the fact that

92
0:04:59.235,000 --> 0:05:01,000
we don't always have it,

93
0:05:01.296,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and that not everything can be explained.

94
0:05:04.053,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Yet whether you're a rationalist or a mystic,

95
0:05:08.215,000 --> 0:05:1,000
whether you think the words Muhammad heard that night

96
0:05:10.91,000 --> 0:05:14,000
came from inside himself or from outside,

97
0:05:15.174,000 --> 0:05:19,000
what's clear is that he did experience them,

98
0:05:19.878,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and that he did so with a force that would shatter

99
0:05:22.314,000 --> 0:05:24,000
his sense of himself and his world

100
0:05:24.635,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and transform this otherwise modest man

101
0:05:27.775,000 --> 0:05:33,000
into a radical advocate for social and economic justice.

102
0:05:34.468,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Fear was the only sane response,

103
0:05:39.71,000 --> 0:05:44,000
the only human response.

104
0:05:44.734,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Too human for some,

105
0:05:47.242,000 --> 0:05:49,000
like conservative Muslim theologians who maintain that

106
0:05:49.975,000 --> 0:05:5,000
the account of his wanting to kill himself

107
0:05:51.842,000 --> 0:05:53,000
shouldn't even be mentioned, despite the fact

108
0:05:54.28,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that it's in the earliest Islamic biographies.

109
0:05:58.734,000 --> 0:06:,000
They insist that he never doubted

110
0:06:01.525,000 --> 0:06:07,000
for even a single moment, let alone despaired.

111
0:06:08.135,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Demanding perfection, they refuse to tolerate

112
0:06:11.972,000 --> 0:06:15,000
human imperfection.

113
0:06:16.691,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Yet what, exactly, is imperfect about doubt?

114
0:06:23.886,000 --> 0:06:25,000
As I read those early accounts, I realized it was

115
0:06:26.86,000 --> 0:06:29,000
precisely Muhammad's doubt that brought him alive for me,

116
0:06:30.67,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that allowed me to begin to see him in full,

117
0:06:33.067,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to accord him the integrity of reality.

118
0:06:36.653,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And the more I thought about it,

119
0:06:38.822,000 --> 0:06:41,000
the more it made sense that he doubted,

120
0:06:41.839,000 --> 0:06:47,000
because doubt is essential to faith.

121
0:06:48.422,000 --> 0:06:5,000
If this seems a startling idea at first,

122
0:06:51.302,000 --> 0:06:54,000
consider that doubt, as Graham Greene once put it,

123
0:06:54.963,000 --> 0:06:57,000
is the heart of the matter.

124
0:06:58.798,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Abolish all doubt, and what's left is not faith,

125
0:07:03.203,000 --> 0:07:08,000
but absolute, heartless conviction.

126
0:07:08.446,000 --> 0:07:11,000
You're certain that you possess the Truth --

127
0:07:12.317,000 --> 0:07:16,000
inevitably offered with an implied uppercase T --

128
0:07:16.608,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and this certainty quickly devolves

129
0:07:19.166,000 --> 0:07:22,000
into dogmatism and righteousness,

130
0:07:22.678,000 --> 0:07:26,000
by which I mean a demonstrative, overweening pride

131
0:07:26.781,000 --> 0:07:29,000
in being so very right,

132
0:07:30.569,000 --> 0:07:37,000
in short, the arrogance of fundamentalism.

133
0:07:38.457,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It has to be one of the multiple ironies of history

134
0:07:42.933,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that a favorite expletive of Muslim fundamentalists

135
0:07:45.991,000 --> 0:07:48,000
is the same one once used by the Christian fundamentalists

136
0:07:49.182,000 --> 0:07:51,000
known as Crusaders:

137
0:07:51.994,000 --> 0:07:56,000
"infidel," from the Latin for "faithless."

138
0:07:57.219,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Doubly ironic, in this case, because their absolutism

139
0:08:01.558,000 --> 0:08:05,000
is in fact the opposite of faith.

140
0:08:06.023,000 --> 0:08:11,000
In effect, they are the infidels.

141
0:08:11.982,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Like fundamentalists of all religious stripes,

142
0:08:14.809,000 --> 0:08:17,000
they have no questions, only answers.

143
0:08:18.654,000 --> 0:08:2,000
They found the perfect antidote to thought

144
0:08:21.446,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and the ideal refuge of the hard demands of real faith.

145
0:08:25.217,000 --> 0:08:26,000
They don't have to struggle for it like Jacob

146
0:08:27.166,000 --> 0:08:29,000
wrestling through the night with the angel,

147
0:08:29.216,000 --> 0:08:32,000
or like Jesus in his 40 days and nights in the wilderness,

148
0:08:32.374,000 --> 0:08:35,000
or like Muhammad, not only that night on the mountain,

149
0:08:35.576,000 --> 0:08:37,000
but throughout his years as a prophet,

150
0:08:38.07,000 --> 0:08:42,000
with the Koran constantly urging him not to despair,

151
0:08:42.254,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and condemning those who most loudly proclaim

152
0:08:45.542,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that they know everything there is to know

153
0:08:49.339,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and that they and they alone are right.

154
0:08:56.233,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And yet we, the vast and still far too silent majority,

155
0:09:03.646,000 --> 0:09:08,000
have ceded the public arena to this extremist minority.

156
0:09:09.415,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We've allowed Judaism to be claimed

157
0:09:11.908,000 --> 0:09:14,000
by violently messianic West Bank settlers,

158
0:09:15.779,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Christianity by homophobic hypocrites

159
0:09:18.726,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and misogynistic bigots,

160
0:09:21.246,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Islam by suicide bombers.

161
0:09:26.205,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And we've allowed ourselves to be blinded to the fact that

162
0:09:28.976,000 --> 0:09:3,000
no matter whether they claim to be Christians,

163
0:09:31.168,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Jews or Muslims,

164
0:09:32.783,000 --> 0:09:37,000
militant extremists are none of the above.

165
0:09:38.438,000 --> 0:09:43,000
They're a cult all their own, blood brothers

166
0:09:44.052,000 --> 0:09:49,000
steeped in other people's blood.

167
0:09:49.546,000 --> 0:09:51,000
This isn't faith.

168
0:09:51.748,000 --> 0:09:56,000
It's fanaticism, and we have to stop confusing the two.

169
0:09:56.91,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We have to recognize that real faith has no easy answers.

170
0:10:01.932,000 --> 0:10:05,000
It's difficult and stubborn.

171
0:10:06.01,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It involves an ongoing struggle,

172
0:10:08.248,000 --> 0:10:11,000
a continual questioning of what we think we know,

173
0:10:11.302,000 --> 0:10:13,000
a wrestling with issues and ideas.

174
0:10:13.867,000 --> 0:10:16,000
It goes hand in hand with doubt,

175
0:10:17.167,000 --> 0:10:2,000
in a never-ending conversation with it,

176
0:10:20.244,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and sometimes in conscious defiance of it.

177
0:10:26.639,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And this conscious defiance is why I, as an agnostic,

178
0:10:31.687,000 --> 0:10:35,000
can still have faith.

179
0:10:35.828,000 --> 0:10:37,000
I have faith, for instance, that peace in the Middle East

180
0:10:38.816,000 --> 0:10:42,000
is possible despite the ever-accumulating mass of evidence

181
0:10:43.126,000 --> 0:10:46,000
to the contrary.

182
0:10:46.287,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I'm not convinced of this.

183
0:10:48.659,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I can hardly say I believe it.

184
0:10:50.783,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I can only have faith in it,

185
0:10:52.725,000 --> 0:10:56,000
commit myself, that is, to the idea of it,

186
0:10:56.743,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and I do this precisely because of the temptation

187
0:10:59.744,000 --> 0:11:01,000
to throw up my hands in resignation

188
0:11:01.744,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and retreat into silence.

189
0:11:05.265,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Because despair is self-fulfilling.

190
0:11:09.946,000 --> 0:11:11,000
If we call something impossible,

191
0:11:12.266,000 --> 0:11:15,000
we act in such a way that we make it so.

192
0:11:16.034,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And I, for one, refuse to live that way.

193
0:11:21.967,000 --> 0:11:23,000
In fact, most of us do,

194
0:11:24.266,000 --> 0:11:27,000
whether we're atheist or theist

195
0:11:27.842,000 --> 0:11:3,000
or anywhere in between or beyond, for that matter,

196
0:11:31.782,000 --> 0:11:35,000
what drives us is that, despite our doubts

197
0:11:36.098,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and even because of our doubts,

198
0:11:38.426,000 --> 0:11:42,000
we reject the nihilism of despair.

199
0:11:42.898,000 --> 0:11:45,000
We insist on faith in the future

200
0:11:46.131,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and in each other.

201
0:11:50.869,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Call this naive if you like.

202
0:11:54.37,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Call it impossibly idealistic if you must.

203
0:11:57.467,000 --> 0:11:59,000
But one thing is sure:

204
0:11:59.895,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Call it human.

205
0:12:03.361,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Could Muhammad have so radically changed his world

206
0:12:06.396,000 --> 0:12:08,000
without such faith, without the refusal

207
0:12:09.248,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to cede to the arrogance of closed-minded certainty?

208
0:12:13.964,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I think not.

209
0:12:17.23,000 --> 0:12:19,000
After keeping company with him as a writer

210
0:12:19.273,000 --> 0:12:22,000
for the past five years, I can't see

211
0:12:22.573,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that he'd be anything but utterly outraged

212
0:12:27.676,000 --> 0:12:3,000
at the militant fundamentalists who claim to speak

213
0:12:30.823,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and act in his name in the Middle East and elsewhere today.

214
0:12:36.292,000 --> 0:12:4,000
He'd be appalled at the repression of half the population

215
0:12:40.582,000 --> 0:12:42,000
because of their gender.

216
0:12:43.58,000 --> 0:12:5,000
He'd be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism.

217
0:12:51.561,000 --> 0:12:53,000
He'd call out terrorism for what it is,

218
0:12:54.267,000 --> 0:12:58,000
not only criminal but an obscene travesty

219
0:12:59.011,000 --> 0:13:03,000
of everything he believed in and struggled for.

220
0:13:03.916,000 --> 0:13:08,000
He'd say what the Koran says: Anyone who takes a life

221
0:13:09.185,000 --> 0:13:12,000
takes the life of all humanity.

222
0:13:12.386,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Anyone who saves a life, saves the life of all humanity.

223
0:13:19.582,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And he'd commit himself fully

224
0:13:22.652,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to the hard and thorny process of making peace.

225
0:13:29.672,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Thank you.

226
0:13:31.107,000 --> 0:13:35,000
(Applause)

227
0:13:35.506,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Thank you. (Applause)

2
0:00:16.43,000 --> 0:00:21,000
As a magician, I'm always interested in performances that incorporate elements of illusion.

3
0:00:21.632,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And one of the most remarkable was the tanagra theater, which was popular in the

4
0:00:26.978,000 --> 0:00:28,000
early part of the 20th century.

5
0:00:29.055,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It used mirrors

6
0:00:30.971,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to create the illusion of tiny people

7
0:00:33.769,000 --> 0:00:37,000
performing on a miniature stage. Now, I won't use mirrors,

8
0:00:37.809,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but this is my digital tribute to the tanagra theater.

9
0:00:42.905,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So let the story begin.

10
0:00:49.368,000 --> 0:00:53,000
On a dark and stormy night -- really! --

11
0:00:54.306,000 --> 0:00:58,000
it was the 10th of July, 1856.

12
0:00:58.417,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Lightning lit the sky,

13
0:01:00.361,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and a baby was born.

14
0:01:02.448,000 --> 0:01:05,000
His name was Nikola,

15
0:01:05.456,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Nikola Tesla.

16
0:01:07.1,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Now the baby grew into a very smart guy.

17
0:01:10.12,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Let me show you.

18
0:01:12.264,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Tesla, what is 236 multiplied by 501?

19
0:01:19.812,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Nikola Tesla: The result is 118,236.

20
0:01:24.358,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Marco Tempest: Now Tesla's brain worked in the most extraordinary way.

21
0:01:28.931,000 --> 0:01:3,000
When a word was mentioned,

22
0:01:31.084,000 --> 0:01:32,000
an image of it

23
0:01:32.147,000 --> 0:01:35,000
instantly appeared in his mind.

24
0:01:35.348,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Tree. Chair. Girl.

25
0:01:41.06,000 --> 0:01:44,000
They were hallucinations, which vanished

26
0:01:44.243,000 --> 0:01:45,000
the moment he touched them.

27
0:01:46.092,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Probably a form of synesthesia.

28
0:01:49.66,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But it was something

29
0:01:51.084,000 --> 0:01:54,000
he later turned to his advantage.

30
0:01:54.676,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Where other scientists would play in their laboratory,

31
0:01:58.663,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Tesla created his inventions in his mind.

32
0:02:02.798,000 --> 0:02:08,000
NT: To my delight, I discovered I could visualize my inventions with the greatest facility.

33
0:02:08.96,000 --> 0:02:12,000
MT: And when they worked in the vivid playground of his imagination,

34
0:02:13.12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
he would build them in his workshop.

35
0:02:15.87,000 --> 0:02:18,000
NT: I needed no models, drawings or experiments.

36
0:02:19.642,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I could picture them as real in my mind,

37
0:02:23.399,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and there I run it, test it and improve it.

38
0:02:26.929,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Only then do I construct it.

39
0:02:29.783,000 --> 0:02:3,000
MT: His great idea

40
0:02:30.88,000 --> 0:02:32,000
was alternating current.

41
0:02:33.031,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But how could he convince the public that

42
0:02:35.535,000 --> 0:02:4,000
the millions of volts required to make it work were safe?

43
0:02:40.569,000 --> 0:02:41,000
To sell his idea,

44
0:02:42.311,000 --> 0:02:44,000
he became a showman.

45
0:02:44.895,000 --> 0:02:49,000
NT: We are at the dawn of a new age,

46
0:02:50.197,000 --> 0:02:52,000
the age of electricity.

47
0:02:52.424,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I have been able, through careful invention, to

48
0:02:56.13,000 --> 0:02:58,000
transmit, with the mere flick of a switch,

49
0:02:58.59,000 --> 0:03:,000
electricity across the ether.

50
0:03:00.851,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It is the magic of science.

51
0:03:04.213,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Applause)

52
0:03:06.79,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Tesla has over 700 patents to his name:

53
0:03:12.518,000 --> 0:03:17,000
radio, wireless telegraphy,

54
0:03:18.366,000 --> 0:03:25,000
remote control, robotics.

55
0:03:25.681,000 --> 0:03:3,000
He even photographed the bones of the human body.

56
0:03:31.087,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But the high point was the realization of a childhood dream:

57
0:03:35.639,000 --> 0:03:4,000
harnessing the raging powers of Niagara Falls,

58
0:03:40.911,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and bringing light to the city.

59
0:03:45.407,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But Tesla's success didn't last.

60
0:03:52.591,000 --> 0:03:54,000
NT: I had bigger ideas.

61
0:03:55.064,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Illuminating the city was only the beginning.

62
0:03:58.246,000 --> 0:04:02,000
A world telegraphy center -- imagine news,

63
0:04:02.99,000 --> 0:04:05,000
messages, sounds, images delivered to

64
0:04:06.937,000 --> 0:04:07,000
any point in the world

65
0:04:08.59,000 --> 0:04:11,000
instantly and wirelessly.

66
0:04:12.543,000 --> 0:04:16,000
MT: It's a great idea; it was a huge project. Expensive, too.

67
0:04:17.035,000 --> 0:04:19,000
NT: They wouldn't give me the money.

68
0:04:19.69,000 --> 0:04:22,000
MT: Well, maybe you shouldn't have told them it could be used to contact other planets.

69
0:04:22.928,000 --> 0:04:26,000
NT: Yes, that was a big mistake.

70
0:04:27.151,000 --> 0:04:31,000
MT: Tesla's career as an inventor never recovered.

71
0:04:31.369,000 --> 0:04:32,000
He became a recluse.

72
0:04:33.225,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Dodged by death,

73
0:04:35.025,000 --> 0:04:36,000
he spent much of his time

74
0:04:36.769,000 --> 0:04:38,000
in his suite at the Waldorf-Astoria.

75
0:04:39.697,000 --> 0:04:44,000
NT: Everything I did, I did for mankind,

76
0:04:45.105,000 --> 0:04:51,000
for a world where there would be no humiliation of the poor by the violence of the rich,

77
0:04:52.024,000 --> 0:04:55,000
where products of intellect, science and art

78
0:04:55.904,000 --> 0:05:,000
will serve society for the betterment and beautification of life.

79
0:05:01.877,000 --> 0:05:06,000
MT: Nikola Tesla died on the 7th of January, 1943.

80
0:05:07.757,000 --> 0:05:09,000
His final resting place

81
0:05:09.906,000 --> 0:05:12,000
is a golden globe that contains his ashes

82
0:05:13.37,000 --> 0:05:16,000
at the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade.

83
0:05:16.69,000 --> 0:05:19,000
His legacy is with us still.

84
0:05:20.203,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Tesla became the man who lit the world,

85
0:05:24.415,000 --> 0:05:26,000
but this was only the beginning.

86
0:05:26.775,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Tesla's insight was profound.

87
0:05:30.159,000 --> 0:05:34,000
NT: Tell me, what will man do when the forests disappear,

88
0:05:35.078,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and the coal deposits are exhausted?

89
0:05:38.655,000 --> 0:05:4,000
MT: Tesla thought he had the answer.

90
0:05:41.135,000 --> 0:05:48,000
We are still asking the question.

91
0:05:48.346,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Thank you.

92
0:05:50.56,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Applause)

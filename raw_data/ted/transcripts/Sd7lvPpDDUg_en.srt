1
0:00:12.992,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Ichthyology,

2
0:00:14.628,000 --> 0:00:15,000
the study of fishes.

3
0:00:16.112,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It looks like a big, boring word,

4
0:00:18.994,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but it's actually quite exciting,

5
0:00:21.199,000 --> 0:00:23,000
because ichthyology is the only "ology"

6
0:00:24.196,000 --> 0:00:25,000
with "YOLO" in it.

7
0:00:25.551,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:27.359,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Now, to the cool kids in the audience,

9
0:00:29.209,000 --> 0:00:33,000
you already know, YOLO stands for "you only live once,"

10
0:00:33.41,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and because I only have one life,

11
0:00:35.096,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I'm going to spend it doing what I always dreamt of doing:

12
0:00:37.883,000 --> 0:00:4,000
seeing the hidden wonders of the world and discovering new species.

13
0:00:41.068,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And that's what I get to do.

14
0:00:42.873,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Now, in recent years, I really focused on caves for finding new species.

15
0:00:47.352,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And it turns out, there's lots of new cavefish species out there.

16
0:00:50.642,000 --> 0:00:51,000
You just have to know where to look,

17
0:00:52.449,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and to maybe be a little thin.

18
0:00:54.682,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

19
0:00:55.8,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Now, cavefishes can tell me a lot about biology and geology.

20
0:01:00.214,000 --> 0:01:03,000
They can tell me how the landmasses around them have changed and moved

21
0:01:04.221,000 --> 0:01:06,000
by being stuck in these little holes,

22
0:01:06.463,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and they can tell me about the evolution of sight, by being blind.

23
0:01:11.193,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now, fish have eyes that are essentially the same as ours.

24
0:01:14.494,000 --> 0:01:17,000
All vertebrates do, and each time a fish species starts to adapt

25
0:01:18.346,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to this dark, cold, cave environment,

26
0:01:20.782,000 --> 0:01:23,000
over many, many generations, they lose their eyes and their eyesight

27
0:01:24.743,000 --> 0:01:27,000
until the end up like an eyeless cavefish like this one here.

28
0:01:27.917,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Now, each cavefish species has evolved in a slightly different way,

29
0:01:31.778,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and each one has a unique geological and biological story to tell us,

30
0:01:35.874,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and that's why it's so exciting when we find a new species.

31
0:01:39.217,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So this is a new species we described, from southern Indiana.

32
0:01:43.075,000 --> 0:01:46,000
We named it Amblyopsis hoosieri, the Hoosier cavefish.

33
0:01:46.996,000 --> 0:01:47,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:48.081,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Its closest relatives are cavefishes in Kentucky,

35
0:01:51.034,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in the Mammoth Cave system.

36
0:01:52.66,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And they start to diverge when the Ohio River split them

37
0:01:55.717,000 --> 0:01:56,000
a few million years ago.

38
0:01:57.419,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And in that time they developed these subtle differences

39
0:02:00.186,000 --> 0:02:02,000
in the genetic architecture behind their blindness.

40
0:02:03.289,000 --> 0:02:06,000
There's this gene called rhodopsin that's super-critical for sight.

41
0:02:06.829,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We have it, and these species have it too,

42
0:02:09.25,000 --> 0:02:11,000
except one species has lost all function in that gene,

43
0:02:12.147,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and the other one maintains it.

44
0:02:14.234,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So this sets up this beautiful natural experiment

45
0:02:18.281,000 --> 0:02:2,000
where we can look at the genes behind our vision,

46
0:02:21.269,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and at the very roots of how we can see.

47
0:02:25.047,000 --> 0:02:26,000
But the genes in these cavefishes

48
0:02:26.785,000 --> 0:02:28,000
can also tell us about deep geological time,

49
0:02:29.595,000 --> 0:02:31,000
maybe no more so than in this species here.

50
0:02:32.079,000 --> 0:02:34,000
This is a new species we described from Madagascar

51
0:02:34.92,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that we named Typhleotris mararybe.

52
0:02:38.245,000 --> 0:02:41,000
That means "big sickness" in Malagasy,

53
0:02:41.534,000 --> 0:02:43,000
for how sick we got trying to collect this species.

54
0:02:44.614,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Now, believe it or not,

55
0:02:46.216,000 --> 0:02:48,000
swimming around sinkholes full of dead things

56
0:02:48.83,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and cave full of bat poop

57
0:02:50.737,000 --> 0:02:52,000
isn't the smartest thing you could be doing with your life,

58
0:02:53.57,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but YOLO.

59
0:02:55.103,000 --> 0:02:58,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:58.922,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Now, I love this species despite the fact that it tried to kill us,

61
0:03:03.12,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and that's because this species in Madagascar,

62
0:03:05.939,000 --> 0:03:07,000
its closest relatives are 6,000 kilometers away,

63
0:03:08.787,000 --> 0:03:09,000
cavefishes in Australia.

64
0:03:10.701,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Now, there's no way a three-inch-long freshwater cavefish

65
0:03:14.36,000 --> 0:03:16,000
can swim across the Indian Ocean,

66
0:03:16.423,000 --> 0:03:18,000
so what we found when we compared the DNA of these species

67
0:03:19.278,000 --> 0:03:22,000
is that they've been separated for more than 100 million years,

68
0:03:22.599,000 --> 0:03:26,000
or about the time that the southern continents were last together.

69
0:03:27.875,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So in fact, these species didn't move at all.

70
0:03:30.105,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It's the continents that moved them.

71
0:03:31.93,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And so they give us, through their DNA,

72
0:03:33.977,000 --> 0:03:35,000
this precise model and measure

73
0:03:36.422,000 --> 0:03:39,000
of how to date and time these ancient geological events.

74
0:03:41.064,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Now, this species here is so new

75
0:03:43.32,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I'm not even allowed to tell you its name yet,

76
0:03:45.827,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but I can tell you it's a new species from Mexico,

77
0:03:48.513,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and it's probably already extinct.

78
0:03:50.667,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It's probably extinct because the only known cave system it's from

79
0:03:54.038,000 --> 0:03:56,000
was destroyed when a dam was built nearby.

80
0:03:56.714,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Unfortunately for cavefishes,

81
0:03:58.7,000 --> 0:03:59,000
their groundwater habitat

82
0:04:00.304,000 --> 0:04:02,000
is also our main source of drinking water.

83
0:04:03.103,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Now, we actually don't know this species' closest relative, yet.

84
0:04:07.825,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It doesn't appear to be anything else in Mexico,

85
0:04:10.499,000 --> 0:04:11,000
so maybe it's something in Cuba,

86
0:04:12.223,000 --> 0:04:14,000
or Florida, or India.

87
0:04:14.83,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But whatever it is, it might tell us something new about the geology

88
0:04:19.359,000 --> 0:04:22,000
of the Caribbean, or the biology of how to better diagnose

89
0:04:22.591,000 --> 0:04:24,000
certain types of blindness.

90
0:04:24.736,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But I hope we discover this species before it goes extinct too.

91
0:04:28.733,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And I'm going to spend my one life

92
0:04:30.672,000 --> 0:04:33,000
as an ichthyologist trying to discover and save

93
0:04:34.233,000 --> 0:04:36,000
these humble little blind cavefishes

94
0:04:36.827,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that can tell us so much about the geology of the planet

95
0:04:40.317,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and the biology of how we see.

96
0:04:42.672,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Thank you.

97
0:04:43.847,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Applause)

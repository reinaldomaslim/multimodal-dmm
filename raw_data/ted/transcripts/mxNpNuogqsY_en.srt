1
0:00:13.798,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I was three months pregnant with twins

2
0:00:16.295,000 --> 0:00:19,000
when my husband Ross and I went to my second sonogram.

3
0:00:21.221,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I was 35 years old at the time,

4
0:00:23.563,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and I knew that that meant we had a higher risk

5
0:00:26.907,000 --> 0:00:27,000
of having a child with a birth defect.

6
0:00:29.907,000 --> 0:00:32,000
So, Ross and I researched the standard birth defects,

7
0:00:32.989,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and we felt reasonably prepared.

8
0:00:35.973,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Well, nothing would have prepared us

9
0:00:37.942,000 --> 0:00:4,000
for the bizarre diagnosis that we were about to face.

10
0:00:42.291,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The doctor explained that one of our twins, Thomas,

11
0:00:45.854,000 --> 0:00:47,000
had a fatal birth defect called anencephaly.

12
0:00:49.476,000 --> 0:00:52,000
This means that his brain was not formed correctly

13
0:00:52.894,000 --> 0:00:53,000
because part of his skull was missing.

14
0:00:55.663,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Babies with this diagnosis typically die in utero

15
0:00:59.211,000 --> 0:01:02,000
or within a few minutes, hours or days of being born.

16
0:01:05.013,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But the other twin, Callum,

17
0:01:08.252,000 --> 0:01:11,000
appeared to be healthy, as far as the doctor could tell,

18
0:01:12.164,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and these twins were identical,

19
0:01:16.355,000 --> 0:01:17,000
genetically identical.

20
0:01:20.125,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So after a lot of questions about how this could have possibly happened,

21
0:01:24.761,000 --> 0:01:27,000
a selective reduction was mentioned,

22
0:01:27.921,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and while this procedure was not impossible,

23
0:01:30.846,000 --> 0:01:34,000
it posed some unique risks for the healthy twin and for me,

24
0:01:35.228,000 --> 0:01:37,000
so we decided to carry the pregnancy to term.

25
0:01:39.101,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So there I was, three months pregnant, with two trimesters ahead of me,

26
0:01:43.316,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and I had to find a way to manage my blood pressure and my stress.

27
0:01:49.268,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And it felt like having a roommate point a loaded gun at you for six months.

28
0:01:55.553,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But I stared down the barrel of that gun for so long

29
0:02:00.507,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that I saw a light at the end of the tunnel.

30
0:02:03.506,000 --> 0:02:06,000
While there was nothing we could do to prevent the tragedy,

31
0:02:06.634,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I wanted to find a way for Thomas's brief life

32
0:02:09.121,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to have some kind of positive impact.

33
0:02:11.366,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So I asked my nurse about organ, eye and tissue donation.

34
0:02:16.08,000 --> 0:02:19,000
She connected with our local organ-procurement organization,

35
0:02:19.625,000 --> 0:02:21,000
the Washington Regional Transplant Community.

36
0:02:23.359,000 --> 0:02:25,000
WRTC explained to me

37
0:02:25.954,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that Thomas would probably be too small at birth to donate for transplant,

38
0:02:30.379,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and I was shocked:

39
0:02:31.553,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I didn't even know you could be rejected for that.

40
0:02:33.981,000 --> 0:02:36,000
But they said that he would be a good candidate to donate for research.

41
0:02:38.29,000 --> 0:02:4,000
This helped me see Thomas in a new light.

42
0:02:40.345,000 --> 0:02:42,000
As opposed to just a victim of a disease,

43
0:02:43.264,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I started to see him as a possible key to unlock a medical mystery.

44
0:02:48.288,000 --> 0:02:51,000
On March 23, 2010,

45
0:02:51.59,000 --> 0:02:53,000
the twins were born, and they were both born alive.

46
0:02:55.978,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And just like the doctor said,

47
0:02:57.668,000 --> 0:03:,000
Thomas was missing the top part of his skull,

48
0:03:00.771,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but he could nurse,

49
0:03:02.318,000 --> 0:03:03,000
drink from a bottle,

50
0:03:03.794,000 --> 0:03:06,000
cuddle and grab our fingers like a normal baby,

51
0:03:07.117,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and he slept in our arms.

52
0:03:10.053,000 --> 0:03:13,000
After six days, Thomas died in Ross's arms

53
0:03:13.466,000 --> 0:03:14,000
surrounded by our family.

54
0:03:16.846,000 --> 0:03:2,000
We called WRTC, who sent a van to our home

55
0:03:21.005,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and brought him to Children's National Medical Center.

56
0:03:24.751,000 --> 0:03:27,000
A few hours later, we got a call to say that the recovery was a success,

57
0:03:28.596,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and Thomas's donations would be going to four different places.

58
0:03:32.159,000 --> 0:03:34,000
His cord blood would go to Duke University.

59
0:03:35.208,000 --> 0:03:39,000
His liver would go to a cell-therapy company called Cytonet in Durham.

60
0:03:40.263,000 --> 0:03:43,000
His corneas would go to Schepens Eye Research Institute,

61
0:03:43.532,000 --> 0:03:45,000
which is part of Harvard Medical School,

62
0:03:45.715,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and his retinas would go to the University of Pennsylvania.

63
0:03:50.083,000 --> 0:03:53,000
A few days later, we had a funeral with our immediate family,

64
0:03:54.035,000 --> 0:03:55,000
including baby Callum,

65
0:03:56.003,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and we basically closed this chapter in our lives.

66
0:03:59.718,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But I did find myself wondering, what's happening now?

67
0:04:03.055,000 --> 0:04:04,000
What are the researchers learning?

68
0:04:05.13,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And was it even worthwhile to donate?

69
0:04:09.019,000 --> 0:04:12,000
WRTC invited Ross and I to a grief retreat,

70
0:04:12.765,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and we met about 15 other grieving families

71
0:04:15.542,000 --> 0:04:17,000
who had donated their loved one's organs for transplant.

72
0:04:19.494,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Some of them had even received letters

73
0:04:21.919,000 --> 0:04:23,000
from the people who received their loved one's organs,

74
0:04:24.912,000 --> 0:04:25,000
saying thank you.

75
0:04:27.038,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I learned that they could even meet each other

76
0:04:29.251,000 --> 0:04:3,000
if they'd both sign a waiver,

77
0:04:30.713,000 --> 0:04:31,000
almost like an open adoption.

78
0:04:32.907,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And I was so excited, I thought maybe I could write a letter

79
0:04:35.77,000 --> 0:04:37,000
or I could get a letter and learn about what happened.

80
0:04:38.403,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But I was disappointed to learn

81
0:04:39.966,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that this process only exists for people who donate for transplant.

82
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So I was jealous. I had transplant envy, I guess.

83
0:04:46.446,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:48.104,000 --> 0:04:49,000
But over the years that followed,

85
0:04:50.024,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I learned a lot more about donation,

86
0:04:52.524,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and I even got a job in the field.

87
0:04:54.626,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And I came up with an idea.

88
0:04:57.879,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I wrote a letter that started out,

89
0:04:59.562,000 --> 0:05:,000
"Dear Researcher."

90
0:05:02.468,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I explained who I was,

91
0:05:04.342,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and I asked if they could tell me why they requested infant retinas

92
0:05:08.234,000 --> 0:05:1,000
in March of 2010,

93
0:05:10.493,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and I asked if my family could visit their lab.

94
0:05:13.953,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I emailed it to the eye bank that arranged the donation,

95
0:05:17.073,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the Old Dominion Eye Foundation,

96
0:05:19.475,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and asked if they could send it to the right person.

97
0:05:22.395,000 --> 0:05:24,000
They said that they had never done this before,

98
0:05:24.65,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and they couldn't guarantee a response,

99
0:05:26.563,000 --> 0:05:28,000
but they wouldn't be an obstacle, and they would deliver it.

100
0:05:30.506,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Two days later, I got a response

101
0:05:32.721,000 --> 0:05:34,000
from Dr. Arupa Ganguly of the University of Pennsylvania.

102
0:05:36.617,000 --> 0:05:37,000
She thanked me for the donation,

103
0:05:38.263,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and she explained that she is studying retinoblastoma,

104
0:05:41.01,000 --> 0:05:42,000
which is a deadly cancer of the retina

105
0:05:42.851,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that affects children under the age of five,

106
0:05:45.001,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and she said that yes, we were invited to visit her lab.

107
0:05:48.612,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So next we talked on the phone,

108
0:05:50.278,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and one of the first things she said to me

109
0:05:52.349,000 --> 0:05:54,000
was that she couldn't possibly imagine how we felt,

110
0:05:55.204,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and that Thomas had given the ultimate sacrifice,

111
0:05:57.968,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and that she seemed to feel indebted to us.

112
0:06:00.709,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So I said, "Nothing against your study,

113
0:06:03.859,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but we didn't actually pick it.

114
0:06:05.549,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We donated to the system, and the system chose your study.

115
0:06:09.493,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I said, "And second of all, bad things happen to children every day,

116
0:06:14.407,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and if you didn't want these retinas,

117
0:06:16.219,000 --> 0:06:18,000
they would probably be buried in the ground right now.

118
0:06:18.773,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So to be able to participate in your study

119
0:06:22.163,000 --> 0:06:25,000
gives Thomas's life a new layer of meaning.

120
0:06:25.83,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So, never feel guilty about using this tissue."

121
0:06:29.845,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Next, she explained to me how rare it was.

122
0:06:32.403,000 --> 0:06:35,000
She had placed a request for this tissue six years earlier

123
0:06:36.123,000 --> 0:06:38,000
with the National Disease Research Interchange.

124
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
She got only one sample of tissue that fit her criteria,

125
0:06:42.518,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and it was Thomas's.

126
0:06:44.958,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Next, we arranged a date for me to come visit the lab,

127
0:06:48.712,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and we chose March 23, 2015, which was the twins' fifth birthday.

128
0:06:54.563,000 --> 0:06:57,000
After we hung up, I emailed her some pictures of Thomas and Callum,

129
0:06:58.523,000 --> 0:07:,000
and a few weeks later, we received this T-shirt in the mail.

130
0:07:03.142,000 --> 0:07:05,000
A few months later, Ross, Callum and I piled in the car

131
0:07:05.965,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and we went for a road trip.

132
0:07:07.58,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We met Arupa and her staff,

133
0:07:10.168,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and Arupa said that when I told her not to feel guilty, that it was a relief,

134
0:07:14.44,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and that she hadn't seen it from our perspective.

135
0:07:18.09,000 --> 0:07:22,000
She also explained that Thomas had a secret code name.

136
0:07:22.931,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The same way Henrietta Lacks is called HeLa,

137
0:07:26.324,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Thomas was called RES 360.

138
0:07:29.394,000 --> 0:07:3,000
RES means research,

139
0:07:30.816,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and 360 means he was the 360th specimen

140
0:07:34.34,000 --> 0:07:35,000
over the course of about 10 years.

141
0:07:37.133,000 --> 0:07:41,000
She also shared with us a unique document,

142
0:07:41.3,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and it was the shipping label

143
0:07:43.809,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that sent his retinas from DC to Philadelphia.

144
0:07:48.273,000 --> 0:07:51,000
This shipping label is like an heirloom to us now.

145
0:07:52.304,000 --> 0:07:55,000
It's the same way that a military medal or a wedding certificate might be.

146
0:07:56.687,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Arupa also explained that she is using Thomas's retina and his RNA

147
0:08:02.111,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to try to inactivate the gene that causes tumor formation,

148
0:08:05.545,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and she even showed us some results that were based on RES 360.

149
0:08:09.959,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Then she took us to the freezer

150
0:08:11.817,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and she showed us the two samples that she still has

151
0:08:15.276,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that are still labeled RES 360.

152
0:08:17.622,000 --> 0:08:18,000
There's two little ones left.

153
0:08:19.506,000 --> 0:08:2,000
She said she saved it

154
0:08:21.058,000 --> 0:08:23,000
because she doesn't know when she might get more.

155
0:08:24.553,000 --> 0:08:26,000
After this, we went to the conference room

156
0:08:26.625,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and we relaxed and we had lunch together,

157
0:08:29.259,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and the lab staff presented Callum with a birthday gift.

158
0:08:34.179,000 --> 0:08:35,000
It was a child's lab kit.

159
0:08:36.419,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And they also offered him an internship.

160
0:08:38.831,000 --> 0:08:41,000
(Laughter)

161
0:08:42.038,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So in closing, I have two simple messages today.

162
0:08:45.578,000 --> 0:08:48,000
One is that most of us probably don't think about donating to research.

163
0:08:49.406,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I know I didn't. I think I'm a normal person.

164
0:08:52.54,000 --> 0:08:53,000
But I did it.

165
0:08:53.715,000 --> 0:08:55,000
It was a good experience, and I recommend it,

166
0:08:55.881,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and it brought my family a lot of peace.

167
0:08:57.849,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And second is if you work with human tissue

168
0:09:00.658,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and you wonder about the donor and about the family,

169
0:09:03.277,000 --> 0:09:04,000
write them a letter.

170
0:09:04.496,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Tell them you received it, tell them what you're working on,

171
0:09:07.336,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and invite them to visit your lab,

172
0:09:09.027,000 --> 0:09:11,000
because that visit may be even more gratifying for you

173
0:09:11.576,000 --> 0:09:12,000
than it is for them.

174
0:09:12.831,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And I'd also like to ask you a favor.

175
0:09:14.617,000 --> 0:09:16,000
If you're ever successful in arranging one of these visits,

176
0:09:17.6,000 --> 0:09:18,000
please tell me about it.

177
0:09:20.064,000 --> 0:09:21,000
The other part of my family's story

178
0:09:21.784,000 --> 0:09:23,000
is that we ended up visiting all four facilities

179
0:09:24.12,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that received Thomas's donations.

180
0:09:26.206,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And we met amazing people doing inspiring work.

181
0:09:30.003,000 --> 0:09:35,000
The way I see it now is that Thomas got into Harvard,

182
0:09:35.128,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Duke and Penn --

183
0:09:37.318,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Laughter)

184
0:09:40.667,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And he has a job at Cytonet,

185
0:09:43.059,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and he has colleagues and he has coworkers

186
0:09:45.868,000 --> 0:09:46,000
who are in the top of their fields.

187
0:09:47.653,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And they need him in order to do their job.

188
0:09:51.137,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And a life that once seemed brief and insignificant

189
0:09:55.812,000 --> 0:10:,000
revealed itself to be vital, everlasting and relevant.

190
0:10:02.224,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And I only hope that my life can be as relevant.

191
0:10:05.512,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Thank you.

192
0:10:06.687,000 --> 0:10:15,000
(Applause)

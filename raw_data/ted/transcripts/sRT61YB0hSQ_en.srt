1
0:00:12.645,000 --> 0:00:16,000
The school of architecture that I studied at some 30 years ago

2
0:00:16.999,000 --> 0:00:19,000
happened to be across the street from the wonderful art gallery

3
0:00:20.862,000 --> 0:00:23,000
designed by the great architect Louis Kahn.

4
0:00:24.977,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I love the building, and I used to visit it quite often.

5
0:00:28.714,000 --> 0:00:29,000
One day,

6
0:00:30.269,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I saw the security guard run his hand across the concrete wall.

7
0:00:36.852,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And it was the way he did it,

8
0:00:38.608,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the expression on his face --

9
0:00:41.254,000 --> 0:00:43,000
something touched me.

10
0:00:43.901,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I could see that the security guard was moved by the building

11
0:00:49.511,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and that architecture has that capacity

12
0:00:53.673,000 --> 0:00:54,000
to move you.

13
0:00:55.349,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I could see it, and I remember thinking,

14
0:00:57.8,000 --> 0:01:01,000
"Wow. How does architecture do that?"

15
0:01:03.175,000 --> 0:01:07,000
At school, I was learning to design,

16
0:01:07.375,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but here -- here was a reaction of the heart.

17
0:01:11.779,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And it touched me to the core.

18
0:01:17.349,000 --> 0:01:21,000
You know, you aspire for beauty,

19
0:01:23.13,000 --> 0:01:28,000
for sensuousness, for atmosphere, the emotional response.

20
0:01:29.55,000 --> 0:01:31,000
That's the realm of the ineffable

21
0:01:32.106,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and the immeasurable.

22
0:01:33.901,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And that's what you live for:

23
0:01:36.791,000 --> 0:01:37,000
a chance to try.

24
0:01:39.678,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So in 2003, there was an open call for designs

25
0:01:43.179,000 --> 0:01:45,000
for the Bahá'í Temple for South America.

26
0:01:45.325,000 --> 0:01:47,000
This was the first temple in all of South America.

27
0:01:48.347,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It's a continental temple,

28
0:01:50.255,000 --> 0:01:53,000
a hugely important milestone for the Bahá'í community,

29
0:01:53.458,000 --> 0:01:57,000
because this would be the last of the continental temples

30
0:01:57.714,000 --> 0:02:,000
and would open the door for national and local temples to be built

31
0:02:01.294,000 --> 0:02:02,000
around the world.

32
0:02:02.643,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And the brief was deceptively simple

33
0:02:06.217,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and unique in the annals of religion:

34
0:02:10.882,000 --> 0:02:14,000
a circular room, nine sides, nine entrances, nine paths,

35
0:02:17.856,000 --> 0:02:22,000
allowing you to come to the temple from all directions,

36
0:02:23.362,000 --> 0:02:25,000
nine symbolizing completeness,

37
0:02:26.32,000 --> 0:02:27,000
perfection.

38
0:02:28.346,000 --> 0:02:31,000
No pulpit, no sermons,

39
0:02:31.884,000 --> 0:02:33,000
as there are no clergy in the Bahá'í faith.

40
0:02:34.83,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And in a world which is putting up walls,

41
0:02:38.959,000 --> 0:02:41,000
the design needed to express in form

42
0:02:42.431,000 --> 0:02:43,000
the very opposite.

43
0:02:44.899,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It had to be open, welcoming

44
0:02:48.871,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to people of all faiths, walks of life, backgrounds,

45
0:02:53.439,000 --> 0:02:54,000
or no faith at all;

46
0:02:56.163,000 --> 0:02:59,000
a new form of sacred space

47
0:02:59.476,000 --> 0:03:01,000
with no pattern

48
0:03:02.474,000 --> 0:03:04,000
or models to draw from.

49
0:03:06.148,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It was like designing one of the first churches for Christianity

50
0:03:10.03,000 --> 0:03:12,000
or one of the first mosques for Islam.

51
0:03:13.869,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So we live in a secular world.

52
0:03:20.399,000 --> 0:03:25,000
How do you design sacred space today?

53
0:03:26.118,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And how do you even define what's sacred today?

54
0:03:32.823,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I stumbled across this beautiful quote from the Bahá'í writings,

55
0:03:37.821,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and it speaks to prayer.

56
0:03:41.252,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It says that if you reach out in prayer,

57
0:03:44.751,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and if your prayer is answered -- which is already very interesting --

58
0:03:48.519,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that the pillars of your heart will become ashine.

59
0:03:54.116,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And I loved this idea of the inner and the outer,

60
0:03:57.768,000 --> 0:04:02,000
like when you see someone and you say, "That person is radiant."

61
0:04:03.999,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And I was thinking, "My gosh, how could we make something

62
0:04:09.055,000 --> 0:04:11,000
architectural out of that,

63
0:04:11.142,000 --> 0:04:15,000
where you create a building

64
0:04:15.371,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and it becomes alive with light?

65
0:04:19.342,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Like alabaster, if you kiss it with light, it becomes alive.

66
0:04:23.384,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And I drew this sketch,

67
0:04:25.55,000 --> 0:04:28,000
something with two layers, translucent

68
0:04:28.935,000 --> 0:04:3,000
with structure in between capturing light.

69
0:04:32.466,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Maybe a pure form, a single form of emanation

70
0:04:38.451,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that you could imagine

71
0:04:40.896,000 --> 0:04:43,000
would be all dome

72
0:04:44.424,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and everything we kept making was looking too much like an egg.

73
0:04:47.919,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Laughter)

74
0:04:49.553,000 --> 0:04:5,000
A blob.

75
0:04:51.526,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So you search.

76
0:04:53.349,000 --> 0:04:57,000
You all know this crazy search, letting the process take you,

77
0:04:57.876,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and you live for the surprises.

78
0:04:59.524,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And I remember quite by accident

79
0:05:01.774,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I saw this little video of a plant moving in light,

80
0:05:07.17,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and it made me think of movement,

81
0:05:10.857,000 --> 0:05:11,000
reach,

82
0:05:12.053,000 --> 0:05:14,000
this idea that the temple could have reach,

83
0:05:14.393,000 --> 0:05:15,000
like this reach for the divine.

84
0:05:17.227,000 --> 0:05:18,000
You can imagine also

85
0:05:19.076,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that movement within a circle could mean movement and stillness,

86
0:05:23.995,000 --> 0:05:24,000
like the cosmos,

87
0:05:26.01,000 --> 0:05:28,000
something you see in many places.

88
0:05:29.705,000 --> 0:05:31,000
(Laughter)

89
0:05:32.131,000 --> 0:05:35,000
But rotation was not enough,

90
0:05:36.668,000 --> 0:05:38,000
because we needed a form.

91
0:05:38.876,000 --> 0:05:4,000
In the Bahá'í writings, it talks about

92
0:05:41.166,000 --> 0:05:45,000
the temples being as perfect as is humanly possible,

93
0:05:46.052,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and we kept thinking, well, what is perfection?

94
0:05:48.653,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And I remember I stumbled into this image of this Japanese basket

95
0:05:53.021,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and thinking our Western notions of perfection need to be challenged,

96
0:05:57.046,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that this wonderful silhouette of this basket, this wonkiness,

97
0:06:01.793,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and that it has the kind of dimple of what you might imagine a shoulder

98
0:06:07.465,000 --> 0:06:08,000
or the cheekbone,

99
0:06:08.996,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and that kind of organic form.

100
0:06:11.873,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And so we drew and made models,

101
0:06:14.71,000 --> 0:06:17,000
these lines that merge at the top,

102
0:06:17.949,000 --> 0:06:18,000
soft lines,

103
0:06:20.307,000 --> 0:06:22,000
which became like drapery

104
0:06:23.272,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and translucent veils and folding,

105
0:06:26.793,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and the idea of not only folding but torquing --

106
0:06:30.907,000 --> 0:06:33,000
you remember the plant and the way it was reaching.

107
0:06:34.737,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And this started to become an interesting form,

108
0:06:38.4,000 --> 0:06:4,000
carving the base, making the entrances.

109
0:06:41.796,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And then we ended up with this.

110
0:06:43.943,000 --> 0:06:46,000
This is this temple with two layers,

111
0:06:47.564,000 --> 0:06:49,000
nine luminous veils,

112
0:06:50.081,000 --> 0:06:51,000
embodied light,

113
0:06:51.58,000 --> 0:06:52,000
soft-flowing lines

114
0:06:53.551,000 --> 0:06:55,000
like luminescent drapery.

115
0:06:55.738,000 --> 0:06:59,000
180 submissions were received from 80 countries,

116
0:06:59.831,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and this was selected.

117
0:07:01.862,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So we went to the next stage of how to build it.

118
0:07:07.851,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We had submitted alabaster.

119
0:07:11.935,000 --> 0:07:13,000
But alabaster was too soft,

120
0:07:14.489,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and we were experimenting, many experiments with materials,

121
0:07:17.989,000 --> 0:07:2,000
trying to think how we could have this kind of shimmer,

122
0:07:22.412,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and we ended up with borosilicate.

123
0:07:25.46,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And borosilicate glass, as you know, is very strong,

124
0:07:29.06,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and if you break borosilicate rods just so and melt them

125
0:07:34.31,000 --> 0:07:36,000
at just the right temperature,

126
0:07:36.638,000 --> 0:07:37,000
we ended up with this new material,

127
0:07:38.43,000 --> 0:07:42,000
this new cast glass which took us about two years to make.

128
0:07:43.578,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And it had this quality that we loved,

129
0:07:45.905,000 --> 0:07:47,000
this idea of the embodied light,

130
0:07:48.976,000 --> 0:07:52,000
but on the inside, we wanted something with a soft light,

131
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
like the inner lining of a jacket.

132
0:07:55.965,000 --> 0:07:58,000
On the outside you have protection, but on the inside you touch it.

133
0:08:00.625,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So we found this tiny vein in a huge quarry in Portugal

134
0:08:06.464,000 --> 0:08:09,000
with this beautiful stone,

135
0:08:09.771,000 --> 0:08:14,000
which the owner had kept for seven generations in his family,

136
0:08:14.805,000 --> 0:08:16,000
waiting for the right project, if you can believe it.

137
0:08:19.697,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Look at this material, it's beautiful.

138
0:08:21.813,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And the way it lights up; it has that translucent quality.

139
0:08:26.224,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So here you see the structure.

140
0:08:28.993,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It lets the light through.

141
0:08:31.329,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And looking down,

142
0:08:35.015,000 --> 0:08:37,000
the nine wings are bound,

143
0:08:37.311,000 --> 0:08:4,000
structurally but symbolically strong,

144
0:08:40.875,000 --> 0:08:42,000
a great symbol of unity:

145
0:08:44.373,000 --> 0:08:47,000
pure geometry, a perfect circle,

146
0:08:47.47,000 --> 0:08:51,000
30 meters in section and in plan,

147
0:08:51.88,000 --> 0:08:52,000
perfectly symmetrical,

148
0:08:53.684,000 --> 0:08:55,000
like the idea of sacredness and geometry.

149
0:08:57.812,000 --> 0:09:,000
And here you see the building going up,

150
0:09:00.992,000 --> 0:09:02,000
2,000 steel nodes,

151
0:09:03.303,000 --> 0:09:06,000
9,000 pieces of steel,

152
0:09:07.017,000 --> 0:09:09,000
7,800 stone pieces,

153
0:09:09.829,000 --> 0:09:13,000
10,000 cast glass pieces, all individual shapes,

154
0:09:14.385,000 --> 0:09:17,000
the entire superstructure all described,

155
0:09:17.442,000 --> 0:09:21,000
engineered, fabricated with aerospace technology,

156
0:09:21.957,000 --> 0:09:24,000
prefabricated machine to machine,

157
0:09:25.168,000 --> 0:09:26,000
robotically,

158
0:09:27.056,000 --> 0:09:29,000
a huge team effort, you can imagine,

159
0:09:29.357,000 --> 0:09:3,000
of literally hundreds,

160
0:09:31.325,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and within three percent of our $30 million budget

161
0:09:36.077,000 --> 0:09:38,000
set in 2006.

162
0:09:38.384,000 --> 0:09:39,000
(Applause)

163
0:09:41.901,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Nine wings bound together

164
0:09:47.017,000 --> 0:09:49,000
forming a nine-pointed star,

165
0:09:50.76,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and the star shape moving in space,

166
0:09:55.187,000 --> 0:09:56,000
tracking the sun.

167
0:10:07.582,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So here it is.

168
0:10:09.046,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Audience: Wow!

169
0:10:11.621,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Applause)

170
0:10:19.806,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Hopefully, a befitting response to that beautiful quote,

171
0:10:25.206,000 --> 0:10:27,000
"a prayer answered,"

172
0:10:27.366,000 --> 0:10:29,000
open in all directions,

173
0:10:30.593,000 --> 0:10:32,000
capturing the blue light of dawn,

174
0:10:34.053,000 --> 0:10:37,000
tent-like white light of day,

175
0:10:37.76,000 --> 0:10:39,000
the gold light of the afternoon,

176
0:10:40.702,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and of course, at night, the reversal:

177
0:10:45.302,000 --> 0:10:46,000
sensuous,

178
0:10:48.191,000 --> 0:10:51,000
catching the light in all kinds of mysterious ways.

179
0:10:53.403,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And the site: it's interesting; 14 years ago when we made the submission,

180
0:10:59.038,000 --> 0:11:01,000
we showed the temple set against the Andes.

181
0:11:01.172,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We didn't have the Andes as our site,

182
0:11:05.525,000 --> 0:11:08,000
but after nine years, that's exactly where we ended up,

183
0:11:10.347,000 --> 0:11:13,000
the lines of the temple set against nothing but pure nature,

184
0:11:13.835,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and you turn around and you get nothing but the city below you,

185
0:11:18.998,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and inside, a view in all directions,

186
0:11:24.925,000 --> 0:11:26,000
radiating gardens

187
0:11:27.58,000 --> 0:11:28,000
from each of the alcoves,

188
0:11:31.277,000 --> 0:11:32,000
radiating paths.

189
0:11:35.97,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Last October, the opening ceremonies --

190
0:11:40.666,000 --> 0:11:43,000
a beautiful, sacred event,

191
0:11:44.451,000 --> 0:11:47,000
5,000 people from 80 countries,

192
0:11:47.502,000 --> 0:11:5,000
a continuous river of visitors,

193
0:11:51.439,000 --> 0:11:54,000
indigenous people from all over South America,

194
0:11:54.933,000 --> 0:11:56,000
some who had never left their villages.

195
0:11:59.103,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And of course, that this temple belongs to people,

196
0:12:03.625,000 --> 0:12:08,000
the collective, of many cultures and walks of life,

197
0:12:09.084,000 --> 0:12:1,000
many beliefs,

198
0:12:10.524,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and for me, what's most important is what it feels like on the inside;

199
0:12:15.161,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that it feel intimate,

200
0:12:18.011,000 --> 0:12:19,000
sacred,

201
0:12:19.79,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and that everyone is welcome.

202
0:12:22.194,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And if even a few who come

203
0:12:26.837,000 --> 0:12:29,000
have the same reaction as that security guard,

204
0:12:31.704,000 --> 0:12:35,000
then it truly would be their temple.

205
0:12:37.062,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And I would love that.

206
0:12:38.687,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Thank you.

207
0:12:39.885,000 --> 0:12:44,000
(Applause)

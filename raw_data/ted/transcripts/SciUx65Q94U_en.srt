1
0:00:12.757,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Five hundred seventy-one million

2
0:00:16.244,000 --> 0:00:22,000
two hundred thirty thousand pounds of paper towels

3
0:00:22.551,000 --> 0:00:23,000
are used by Americans

4
0:00:24.438,000 --> 0:00:27,000
every year.

5
0:00:28.109,000 --> 0:00:31,000
If we could -- correction, wrong figure --

6
0:00:31.164,000 --> 0:00:33,000
13 billion used every year.

7
0:00:33.515,000 --> 0:00:36,000
If we could reduce the usage of paper towels,

8
0:00:36.618,000 --> 0:00:39,000
one paper towel per person per day,

9
0:00:39.8,000 --> 0:00:45,000
571,230,000 pounds of paper not used.

10
0:00:46.681,000 --> 0:00:48,000
We can do that.

11
0:00:48.816,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Now there are all kinds of paper towel dispensers.

12
0:00:52.746,000 --> 0:00:56,000
There's the tri-fold. People typically take two or three.

13
0:00:56.977,000 --> 0:01:,000
There's the one that cuts it, that you have to tear off.

14
0:01:01.14,000 --> 0:01:03,000
People go one, two, three, four, tear.

15
0:01:03.404,000 --> 0:01:04,000
This much, right?

16
0:01:04.842,000 --> 0:01:06,000
There's the one that cuts itself.

17
0:01:07.307,000 --> 0:01:11,000
People go, one, two, three, four.

18
0:01:11.447,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Or there's the same thing, but recycled paper,

19
0:01:15.522,000 --> 0:01:19,000
you have to get five of those because they're not as absorbent, of course.

20
0:01:20.035,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The fact is, you can do it all with one towel.

21
0:01:26.556,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The key, two words:

22
0:01:28.596,000 --> 0:01:32,000
This half of the room, your word is "shake."

23
0:01:33.044,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Let's hear it. Shake. Louder.

24
0:01:35.226,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Audience: Shake.

25
0:01:36.771,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Joe Smith: Your word is "fold."

26
0:01:38.947,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Audience: Fold.

27
0:01:40.063,000 --> 0:01:4,000
JS: Again.

28
0:01:40.99,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Audience: Fold. JS: Really loud.

29
0:01:43.059,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Audience: Shake. Fold.

30
0:01:44.607,000 --> 0:01:48,000
JS: OK. Wet hands.

31
0:01:48.767,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Shake -- one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

32
0:01:53.567,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Why 12? Twelve apostles, twelve tribes,

33
0:01:56.505,000 --> 0:02:,000
twelve zodiac signs, twelve months. The one I like the best:

34
0:02:00.612,000 --> 0:02:02,000
It's the biggest number with one syllable.

35
0:02:02.809,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:07.071,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Tri-fold. Fold ...

37
0:02:14.431,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Dry.

38
0:02:15.983,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Applause)

39
0:02:20.215,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Audience: Shake.

40
0:02:25.429,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Fold.

41
0:02:28.361,000 --> 0:02:3,000
JS: Cuts itself. Fold. The fold is important

42
0:02:30.939,000 --> 0:02:34,000
because it allows interstitial suspension.

43
0:02:35.821,000 --> 0:02:37,000
You don't have to remember that part, but trust me.

44
0:02:38.299,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:43.352,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Audience: Shake. Fold.

46
0:02:50.069,000 --> 0:02:55,000
JS: Cuts itself.

47
0:02:55.731,000 --> 0:02:56,000
You know the funny thing is,

48
0:02:56.888,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I get my hands drier than people do with three or four,

49
0:02:59.063,000 --> 0:03:01,000
because they can't get in between the cracks.

50
0:03:01.511,000 --> 0:03:04,000
If you think this isn't as good...

51
0:03:04.655,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Audience: Shake. Fold.

52
0:03:13.124,000 --> 0:03:16,000
JS: Now, there's now a real fancy invention,

53
0:03:16.692,000 --> 0:03:18,000
it's the one where you wave your hand

54
0:03:19.099,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and it kicks it out.

55
0:03:20.89,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It's way too big a towel.

56
0:03:22.976,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Let me tell you a secret.

57
0:03:24.003,000 --> 0:03:26,000
If you're really quick, if you're really quick --

58
0:03:26.09,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and I can prove this --

59
0:03:27.67,000 --> 0:03:31,000
this is half a towel from the dispenser in this building.

60
0:03:32.519,000 --> 0:03:35,000
How? As soon as it starts, you just tear it off.

61
0:03:35.886,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It's smart enough to stop.

62
0:03:37.558,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And you get half a towel.

63
0:03:41.55,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Audience: Shake. Fold.

64
0:03:54.827,000 --> 0:04:,000
JS: Now, let's all say it together. Shake. Fold.

65
0:04:01.661,000 --> 0:04:05,000
You will for the rest of your life remember those words

66
0:04:05.804,000 --> 0:04:07,000
every time you pick up a paper towel.

67
0:04:08.787,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And remember, one towel per person for one year --

68
0:04:13.875,000 --> 0:04:17,000
571,230,000 pounds of paper. No small thing.

69
0:04:18.595,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And next year, toilet paper.

70
0:04:20.843,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Laughter)

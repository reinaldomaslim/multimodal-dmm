1
0:00:12.58,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Since 2009, the world has been stuck

2
0:00:16.5,000 --> 0:00:21,000
on a single narrative around a coming global food crisis

3
0:00:21.66,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and what we need to do to avoid it.

4
0:00:24.86,000 --> 0:00:28,000
How do we feed nine billion people by 2050?

5
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Every conference, podcast and dialogue around global food security

6
0:00:34.9,000 --> 0:00:35,000
starts with this question

7
0:00:36.62,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and goes on to answer it

8
0:00:38.38,000 --> 0:00:42,000
by saying we need to produce 70 percent more food.

9
0:00:44.98,000 --> 0:00:46,000
The 2050 narrative started to evolve

10
0:00:47.82,000 --> 0:00:51,000
shortly after global food prices hit all-time highs in 2008.

11
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
People were suffering and struggling,

12
0:00:56.06,000 --> 0:00:57,000
governments and world leaders

13
0:00:57.62,000 --> 0:00:59,000
needed to show us that they were paying attention

14
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and were working to solve it.

15
0:01:03.58,000 --> 0:01:06,000
The thing is, 2050 is so far into the future

16
0:01:07.38,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that we can't even relate to it,

17
0:01:10.1,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and more importantly,

18
0:01:11.86,000 --> 0:01:13,000
if we keep doing what we're doing,

19
0:01:14.14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
it's going to hit us a lot sooner than that.

20
0:01:17.9,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I believe we need to ask a different question.

21
0:01:22.1,000 --> 0:01:24,000
The answer to that question

22
0:01:24.46,000 --> 0:01:26,000
needs to be framed differently.

23
0:01:28.94,000 --> 0:01:3,000
If we can reframe the old narrative

24
0:01:31.7,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and replace it with new numbers

25
0:01:34.18,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that tell us a more complete pictures,

26
0:01:37.54,000 --> 0:01:4,000
numbers that everyone can understand

27
0:01:40.74,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and relate to,

28
0:01:43.14,000 --> 0:01:45,000
we can avoid the crisis altogether.

29
0:01:48.38,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I was a commodities trader in my past life

30
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and one of the things that I learned trading

31
0:01:53.46,000 --> 0:01:55,000
is that every market has a tipping point,

32
0:01:57.18,000 --> 0:02:,000
the point at which change occurs so rapidly

33
0:02:00.78,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that it impacts the world

34
0:02:02.66,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and things change forever.

35
0:02:05.9,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Think of the last financial crisis,

36
0:02:09.62,000 --> 0:02:1,000
or the dot-com crash.

37
0:02:12.74,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So here's my concern.

38
0:02:16.58,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We could have a tipping point

39
0:02:18.66,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in global food and agriculture

40
0:02:20.82,000 --> 0:02:21,000
if surging demand

41
0:02:22.739,000 --> 0:02:28,000
surpasses the agricultural system's structural capacity to produce food.

42
0:02:30.06,000 --> 0:02:34,000
This means at this point supply can no longer keep up with demand

43
0:02:34.82,000 --> 0:02:36,000
despite exploding prices,

44
0:02:37.1,000 --> 0:02:41,000
unless we can commit to some type of structural change.

45
0:02:42.38,000 --> 0:02:43,000
This time around,

46
0:02:44.18,000 --> 0:02:46,000
it won't be about stock markets and money.

47
0:02:46.78,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It's about people.

48
0:02:48.18,000 --> 0:02:51,000
People could starve and governments may fall.

49
0:02:53.02,000 --> 0:02:57,000
This question of at what point does supply struggle

50
0:02:57.58,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to keep up with surging demand

51
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
is one that started off as an interest for me while I was trading

52
0:03:02.94,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and became an absolute obsession.

53
0:03:05.74,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It went from interest to obsession

54
0:03:08.7,000 --> 0:03:11,000
when I realized through my research how broken the system was

55
0:03:12.38,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and how very little data was being used to make such critical decisions.

56
0:03:17.46,000 --> 0:03:21,000
That's the point I decided to walk away from a career on Wall Street

57
0:03:21.74,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and start an entrepreneurial journey

58
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
to start Gro Intelligence.

59
0:03:26.7,000 --> 0:03:29,000
At Gro, we focus on bringing this data

60
0:03:30.22,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and doing the work to make it actionable,

61
0:03:32.5,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to empower decision-makers at every level.

62
0:03:36.7,000 --> 0:03:37,000
But doing this work,

63
0:03:38.34,000 --> 0:03:4,000
we also realized that the world,

64
0:03:40.62,000 --> 0:03:41,000
not just world leaders,

65
0:03:42.3,000 --> 0:03:46,000
but businesses and citizens like every single person in this room,

66
0:03:46.58,000 --> 0:03:48,000
lacked an actionable guide

67
0:03:49.58,000 --> 0:03:53,000
on how we can avoid a coming global food security crisis.

68
0:03:54.22,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And so we built a model,

69
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
leveraging the petabytes of data we sit on,

70
0:03:59.18,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and we solved for the tipping point.

71
0:04:02.38,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Now, no one knows we've been working on this problem

72
0:04:06.02,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and this is the first time that I'm sharing what we discovered.

73
0:04:12.02,000 --> 0:04:16,000
We discovered that the tipping point is actually a decade from now.

74
0:04:18.1,000 --> 0:04:2,000
We discovered that the world

75
0:04:20.46,000 --> 0:04:24,000
will be short 214 trillion calories

76
0:04:26.78,000 --> 0:04:27,000
by 2027.

77
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The world is not in a position to fill this gap.

78
0:04:34.22,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Now, you'll notice

79
0:04:36.78,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that the way I'm framing this is different from how I started,

80
0:04:41.1,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and that's intentional, because until now

81
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
this problem has been quantified using mass:

82
0:04:46.5,000 --> 0:04:48,000
think kilograms, tons, hectograms,

83
0:04:49.34,000 --> 0:04:51,000
whatever your unit of choice is in mass.

84
0:04:52.1,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Why do we talk about food in terms of weight?

85
0:04:55.18,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Because it's easy.

86
0:04:56.62,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We can look at a photograph and determine tonnage on a ship

87
0:05:00.14,000 --> 0:05:02,000
by using a simple pocket calculator.

88
0:05:02.42,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We can weigh trucks, airplanes and oxcarts.

89
0:05:05.7,000 --> 0:05:09,000
But what we care about in food is nutritional value.

90
0:05:10.86,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Not all foods are created equal,

91
0:05:14.02,000 --> 0:05:15,000
even if they weigh the same.

92
0:05:16.74,000 --> 0:05:18,000
This I learned firsthand

93
0:05:19.22,000 --> 0:05:22,000
when I moved from Ethiopia to the US for university.

94
0:05:23.02,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Upon my return back home,

95
0:05:25.18,000 --> 0:05:28,000
my father, who was so excited to see me,

96
0:05:28.42,000 --> 0:05:31,000
greeted me by asking why I was fat.

97
0:05:32.78,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Now, turns out that eating

98
0:05:38.58,000 --> 0:05:42,000
approximately the same amount of food as I did in Ethiopia, but in America,

99
0:05:43.46,000 --> 0:05:46,000
had actually lent a certain fullness to my figure.

100
0:05:48.58,000 --> 0:05:52,000
This is why we should care about calories,

101
0:05:52.7,000 --> 0:05:53,000
not about mass.

102
0:05:54.38,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It is calories which sustain us.

103
0:05:58.7,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So 214 trillion calories is a very large number,

104
0:06:04.54,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and not even the most dedicated of us

105
0:06:07.7,000 --> 0:06:09,000
think in the hundreds of trillions of calories.

106
0:06:10.66,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So let me break this down differently.

107
0:06:13.7,000 --> 0:06:16,000
An alternative way to think about this

108
0:06:17.06,000 --> 0:06:19,000
is to think about it in Big Macs.

109
0:06:19.94,000 --> 0:06:21,000
214 trillion calories.

110
0:06:22.58,000 --> 0:06:25,000
A single Big Mac has 563 calories.

111
0:06:25.82,000 --> 0:06:31,000
That means the world will be short 379 billion Big Macs in 2027.

112
0:06:32.06,000 --> 0:06:36,000
That is more Big Macs than McDonald's has ever produced.

113
0:06:37.78,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So how did we get to these numbers in the first place?

114
0:06:41.86,000 --> 0:06:42,000
They're not made up.

115
0:06:44.22,000 --> 0:06:48,000
This map shows you where the world was 40 years ago.

116
0:06:49.06,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It shows you net calorie gaps in every country in the world.

117
0:06:53.1,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Now, simply put,

118
0:06:54.58,000 --> 0:06:57,000
this is just calories consumed in that country

119
0:06:57.62,000 --> 0:07:,000
minus calories produced in that same country.

120
0:07:00.7,000 --> 0:07:02,000
This is not a statement on malnutrition or anything else.

121
0:07:03.5,000 --> 0:07:07,000
It's simply saying how many calories are consumed in a single year

122
0:07:07.54,000 --> 0:07:08,000
minus how many are produced.

123
0:07:09.42,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Blue countries are net calorie exporters,

124
0:07:12.82,000 --> 0:07:13,000
or self-sufficient.

125
0:07:14.22,000 --> 0:07:16,000
They have some in storage for a rainy day.

126
0:07:16.9,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Red countries are net calorie importers.

127
0:07:19.74,000 --> 0:07:2,000
The deeper, the brighter the red,

128
0:07:21.7,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the more you're importing.

129
0:07:24.02,000 --> 0:07:28,000
40 years ago, such few countries were net exporters of calories,

130
0:07:28.5,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I could count them with one hand.

131
0:07:31.18,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Most of the African continent,

132
0:07:33.3,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Europe, most of Asia,

133
0:07:35.94,000 --> 0:07:37,000
South America excluding Argentina,

134
0:07:37.98,000 --> 0:07:38,000
were all net importers of calories.

135
0:07:40.38,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And what's surprising is that China used to actually be food self-sufficient.

136
0:07:44.5,000 --> 0:07:46,000
India was a big net importer of calories.

137
0:07:48.9,000 --> 0:07:5,000
40 years later, this is today.

138
0:07:51.78,000 --> 0:07:54,000
You can see the drastic transformation that's occurred in the world.

139
0:07:55.86,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Brazil has emerged as an agricultural powerhouse.

140
0:07:59.38,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Europe is dominant in global agriculture.

141
0:08:02.66,000 --> 0:08:04,000
India has actually flipped from red to blue.

142
0:08:05.66,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It's become food self-sufficient.

143
0:08:07.94,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And China went from that light blue

144
0:08:10.42,000 --> 0:08:12,000
to the brightest red that you see on this map.

145
0:08:14.1,000 --> 0:08:16,000
How did we get here? What happened?

146
0:08:17.78,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So this chart shows you India and Africa.

147
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Blue line is India, red line is Africa.

148
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
How is it that two regions that started off so similarly

149
0:08:28.42,000 --> 0:08:3,000
in such similar trajectories

150
0:08:30.58,000 --> 0:08:32,000
take such different paths?

151
0:08:32.74,000 --> 0:08:34,000
India had a green revolution.

152
0:08:35.82,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Not a single African country had a green revolution.

153
0:08:39.94,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The net outcome?

154
0:08:41.18,000 --> 0:08:42,000
India is food self-sufficient

155
0:08:42.9,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and in the past decade has actually been exporting calories.

156
0:08:46.3,000 --> 0:08:49,000
The African continent now imports over 300 trillion calories a year.

157
0:08:51.1,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Then we add China, the green line.

158
0:08:55.42,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Remember the switch from the blue to the bright red?

159
0:08:58.94,000 --> 0:09:01,000
What happened and when did it happen?

160
0:09:02.02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
China seemed to be on a very similar path to India

161
0:09:04.9,000 --> 0:09:06,000
until the start of the 21st century,

162
0:09:07.7,000 --> 0:09:08,000
where it suddenly flipped.

163
0:09:10.22,000 --> 0:09:12,000
A young and growing population

164
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
combined with significant economic growth

165
0:09:15.38,000 --> 0:09:17,000
made its mark with a big bang

166
0:09:17.82,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and no one in the markets saw it coming.

167
0:09:21.34,000 --> 0:09:24,000
This flip was everything to global agricultural markets.

168
0:09:25.1,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Luckily now, South America

169
0:09:27.94,000 --> 0:09:32,000
was starting to boom at the same time as China's rise,

170
0:09:33.18,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and so therefore, supply and demand were still somewhat balanced.

171
0:09:38.14,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So the question becomes,

172
0:09:40.46,000 --> 0:09:41,000
where do we go from here?

173
0:09:43.62,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Oddly enough,

174
0:09:45.18,000 --> 0:09:46,000
it's not a new story,

175
0:09:47.62,000 --> 0:09:5,000
except this time it's not just a story of China.

176
0:09:51.02,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It's a continuation of China,

177
0:09:53.42,000 --> 0:09:55,000
an amplification of Africa

178
0:09:55.54,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and a paradigm shift in India.

179
0:09:58.42,000 --> 0:09:59,000
By 2023,

180
0:10:00.82,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Africa's population is forecasted to overtake that of India's and China's.

181
0:10:05.9,000 --> 0:10:07,000
By 2023, these three regions combined

182
0:10:08.58,000 --> 0:10:11,000
will make up over half the world's population.

183
0:10:13.22,000 --> 0:10:17,000
This crossover point starts to present really interesting challenges

184
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
for global food security.

185
0:10:19.02,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And a few years later, we're hit hard with that reality.

186
0:10:23.94,000 --> 0:10:26,000
What does the world look like in 10 years?

187
0:10:28.94,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So far, as I mentioned, India has been food self-sufficient.

188
0:10:32.86,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Most forecasters predict that this will continue.

189
0:10:37.02,000 --> 0:10:38,000
We disagree.

190
0:10:38.98,000 --> 0:10:42,000
India will soon become a net importer of calories.

191
0:10:43.14,000 --> 0:10:45,000
This will be driven both by the fact

192
0:10:45.42,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that demand is growing from a population growth standpoint

193
0:10:48.94,000 --> 0:10:49,000
plus economic growth.

194
0:10:50.22,000 --> 0:10:51,000
It will be driven by both.

195
0:10:51.5,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And even if you have optimistic assumptions

196
0:10:54.22,000 --> 0:10:55,000
around production growth,

197
0:10:56.14,000 --> 0:10:58,000
it will make that slight flip.

198
0:10:58.78,000 --> 0:11:01,000
That slight flip can have huge implications.

199
0:11:03.62,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Next, Africa will continue to be a net importer of calories,

200
0:11:08.18,000 --> 0:11:11,000
again driven by population growth and economic growth.

201
0:11:11.94,000 --> 0:11:14,000
This is again assuming optimistic production growth assumptions.

202
0:11:15.86,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Then China,

203
0:11:17.3,000 --> 0:11:19,000
where population is flattening out,

204
0:11:19.9,000 --> 0:11:2,000
calorie consumption will explode

205
0:11:21.9,000 --> 0:11:24,000
because the types of calories consumed

206
0:11:24.94,000 --> 0:11:27,000
are also starting to be higher-calorie-content foods.

207
0:11:29.42,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And so therefore,

208
0:11:31.18,000 --> 0:11:32,000
these three regions combined

209
0:11:33.06,000 --> 0:11:36,000
start to present a really interesting challenge for the world.

210
0:11:36.38,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Until now, countries with calorie deficits

211
0:11:40.5,000 --> 0:11:42,000
have been able to meet these deficits

212
0:11:43.1,000 --> 0:11:44,000
by importing from surplus regions.

213
0:11:45.54,000 --> 0:11:47,000
By surplus regions, I'm talking about

214
0:11:48.38,000 --> 0:11:51,000
North America, South America and Europe.

215
0:11:51.54,000 --> 0:11:53,000
This line chart over here shows you

216
0:11:53.98,000 --> 0:11:57,000
the growth and the projected growth over the next decade of production

217
0:11:58.3,000 --> 0:12:,000
from North America, South America and Europe.

218
0:12:00.62,000 --> 0:12:01,000
What it doesn't show you

219
0:12:02.06,000 --> 0:12:05,000
is that most of this growth is actually going to come from South America.

220
0:12:06.46,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And most of this growth

221
0:12:07.9,000 --> 0:12:11,000
is going to come at the huge cost of deforestation.

222
0:12:14.06,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And so when you look at the combined demand increase

223
0:12:17.86,000 --> 0:12:2,000
coming from India, China and the African continent,

224
0:12:22.02,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and look at it versus the combined increase in production

225
0:12:24.86,000 --> 0:12:26,000
coming from India, China, the African continent,

226
0:12:27.66,000 --> 0:12:29,000
North America, South America and Europe,

227
0:12:31.1,000 --> 0:12:36,000
you are left with a 214-trillion-calorie deficit,

228
0:12:36.54,000 --> 0:12:37,000
one we can't produce.

229
0:12:38.3,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And this, by the way, is actually assuming we take all the extra calories

230
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
produced in North America, South America and Europe

231
0:12:45.7,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and export them solely to India, China and Africa.

232
0:12:51.02,000 --> 0:12:54,000
What I just presented to you is a vision of an impossible world.

233
0:12:55.34,000 --> 0:12:56,000
We can do something to change that.

234
0:12:58.22,000 --> 0:13:,000
We can change consumption patterns,

235
0:13:00.54,000 --> 0:13:02,000
we can reduce food waste,

236
0:13:02.82,000 --> 0:13:05,000
or we can make a bold commitment

237
0:13:06.06,000 --> 0:13:08,000
to increasing yields exponentially.

238
0:13:09.54,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Now, I'm not going to go into discussing

239
0:13:11.7,000 --> 0:13:13,000
changing consumption patterns or reducing food waste,

240
0:13:14.22,000 --> 0:13:17,000
because those conversations have been going on for some time now.

241
0:13:17.3,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Nothing has happened.

242
0:13:18.54,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Nothing has happened because those arguments

243
0:13:22.02,000 --> 0:13:24,000
ask the surplus regions to change their behavior

244
0:13:24.98,000 --> 0:13:26,000
on behalf of deficit regions.

245
0:13:28.7,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Waiting for others to change their behavior

246
0:13:31.3,000 --> 0:13:33,000
on your behalf, for your survival,

247
0:13:33.82,000 --> 0:13:34,000
is a terrible idea.

248
0:13:35.34,000 --> 0:13:36,000
It's unproductive.

249
0:13:37.38,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So I'd like to suggest an alternative that comes from the red regions.

250
0:13:43.78,000 --> 0:13:45,000
China, India, Africa.

251
0:13:46.18,000 --> 0:13:49,000
China is constrained in terms of how much more land it actually has

252
0:13:49.5,000 --> 0:13:5,000
available for agriculture,

253
0:13:51.06,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and it has massive water resource availability issues.

254
0:13:54.86,000 --> 0:13:57,000
So the answer really lies in India and in Africa.

255
0:13:59.66,000 --> 0:14:03,000
India has some upside in terms of potential yield increases.

256
0:14:04.62,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Now this is the gap between its current yield

257
0:14:07.22,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and the theoretical maximum yield it can achieve.

258
0:14:11.54,000 --> 0:14:14,000
It has some unfarmed arable land remaining, but not much,

259
0:14:14.78,000 --> 0:14:16,000
India is quite land-constrained.

260
0:14:18.06,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Now, the African continent, on the other hand,

261
0:14:20.74,000 --> 0:14:23,000
has vast amounts of arable land remaining

262
0:14:24.06,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and significant upside potential in yields.

263
0:14:27.9,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Somewhat simplified picture here,

264
0:14:30.02,000 --> 0:14:35,000
but if you look at sub-Saharan African yields in corn today,

265
0:14:35.06,000 --> 0:14:38,000
they are where North American yields were in 1940.

266
0:14:40.42,000 --> 0:14:43,000
We don't have 70-plus years to figure this out,

267
0:14:44.18,000 --> 0:14:46,000
so it means we need to try something new

268
0:14:46.74,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and we need to try something different.

269
0:14:50.22,000 --> 0:14:52,000
The solution starts with reforms.

270
0:14:53.7,000 --> 0:14:56,000
We need to reform and commercialize

271
0:14:57.7,000 --> 0:14:59,000
the agricultural industries in Africa

272
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and in India.

273
0:15:02.14,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Now, by commercialization --

274
0:15:04.3,000 --> 0:15:07,000
commercialization is not about commercial farming alone.

275
0:15:07.46,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Commercialization is about leveraging data

276
0:15:10.06,000 --> 0:15:12,000
to craft better policies,

277
0:15:12.38,000 --> 0:15:13,000
to improve infrastructure,

278
0:15:14.02,000 --> 0:15:15,000
to lower the transportation costs

279
0:15:15.9,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and to completely reform banking and insurance industries.

280
0:15:20.18,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Commercialization is about taking agriculture

281
0:15:23.3,000 --> 0:15:27,000
from too risky an endeavor to one where fortunes can be made.

282
0:15:27.42,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Commercialization is not about just farmers.

283
0:15:30.7,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Commercialization is about the entire agricultural system.

284
0:15:36.66,000 --> 0:15:4,000
But commercialization also means confronting the fact

285
0:15:40.74,000 --> 0:15:43,000
that we can no longer place the burden of growth

286
0:15:44.18,000 --> 0:15:46,000
on small-scale farmers alone,

287
0:15:48.42,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and accepting that commercial farms and the introduction of commercial farms

288
0:15:53.7,000 --> 0:15:55,000
could provide certain economies of scale

289
0:15:56.42,000 --> 0:15:58,000
that even small-scale farmers can leverage.

290
0:15:59.86,000 --> 0:16:02,000
It is not about small-scale farming or commercial agriculture,

291
0:16:03.86,000 --> 0:16:04,000
or big agriculture.

292
0:16:05.74,000 --> 0:16:1,000
We can create the first successful models of the coexistence and success

293
0:16:11.02,000 --> 0:16:14,000
of small-scale farming alongside commercial agriculture.

294
0:16:14.82,000 --> 0:16:17,000
This is because, for the first time ever,

295
0:16:17.86,000 --> 0:16:2,000
the most critical tool for success in the industry --

296
0:16:21.62,000 --> 0:16:22,000
data and knowledge --

297
0:16:23.14,000 --> 0:16:25,000
is becoming cheaper by the day.

298
0:16:26.54,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And very soon, it won't matter how much money you have

299
0:16:29.98,000 --> 0:16:3,000
or how big you are

300
0:16:31.46,000 --> 0:16:35,000
to make optimal decisions and maximize probability of success

301
0:16:35.78,000 --> 0:16:37,000
in reaching your intended goal.

302
0:16:39.14,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Companies like Gro are working really hard to make this a reality.

303
0:16:43.42,000 --> 0:16:47,000
So if we can commit to this new, bold initiative,

304
0:16:48.02,000 --> 0:16:5,000
to this new, bold change,

305
0:16:50.06,000 --> 0:16:55,000
not only can we solve the 214-trillion gap that I talked about,

306
0:16:55.5,000 --> 0:16:57,000
but we can actually set the world on a whole new path.

307
0:16:58.78,000 --> 0:17:02,000
India can remain food self-sufficient

308
0:17:02.9,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and Africa can emerge as the world's next dark blue region.

309
0:17:09.06,000 --> 0:17:11,000
The new question is,

310
0:17:11.3,000 --> 0:17:15,000
how do we produce 214 trillion calories

311
0:17:15.46,000 --> 0:17:19,000
to feed 8.3 billion people by 2027?

312
0:17:20.58,000 --> 0:17:21,000
We have the solution.

313
0:17:22.78,000 --> 0:17:23,000
We just need to act on it.

314
0:17:25.34,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Thank you.

315
0:17:26.58,000 --> 0:17:29,000
(Applause)

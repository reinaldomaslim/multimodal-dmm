1
0:00:12.919,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So, I have an overlooked but potentially lucrative

2
0:00:17.285,000 --> 0:00:18,000
investment opportunity for you.

3
0:00:20.447,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Over the past 10 years in the UK,

4
0:00:22.885,000 --> 0:00:25,000
the return on burial plots has outperformed the UK property market

5
0:00:26.344,000 --> 0:00:28,000
by a ratio of around three to one.

6
0:00:29.924,000 --> 0:00:32,000
There are private cemeteries being set up with plots for sale to investors,

7
0:00:33.77,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and they start at around 3,900 pounds.

8
0:00:36.938,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And they're projected to achieve about 40 percent growth.

9
0:00:40.484,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The biggest advantage is that this is a market with continuous demand.

10
0:00:47.996,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Now, this is a real proposition,

11
0:00:50.085,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and there are companies out there that really are offering this investment,

12
0:00:54.555,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but my interest in it is quite different.

13
0:00:57.713,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I'm an architect and urban designer,

14
0:00:59.779,000 --> 0:01:,000
and for the past year and a half,

15
0:01:01.394,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I've been looking at approaches to death and dying

16
0:01:04.418,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and at how they've shaped our cities and the buildings within them.

17
0:01:08.515,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So in the summer, I did my first exhibition

18
0:01:11.699,000 --> 0:01:13,000
on death and architecture in Venice,

19
0:01:14.239,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and it was called "Death in Venice."

20
0:01:16.563,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And because death is a subject

21
0:01:18.588,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that many of us find quite uncomfortable to talk about,

22
0:01:21.669,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the exhibition was designed to be quite playful,

23
0:01:24.018,000 --> 0:01:26,000
so that people would literally engage with it.

24
0:01:26.882,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So one of our exhibits was an interactive map of London

25
0:01:30.451,000 --> 0:01:33,000
which showed just how much of the real estate in the city

26
0:01:33.493,000 --> 0:01:34,000
is given over to death.

27
0:01:35.467,000 --> 0:01:37,000
As you wave your hand across the map,

28
0:01:37.673,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the name of the piece of real estate -- the building or the cemetery --

29
0:01:41.202,000 --> 0:01:42,000
is revealed.

30
0:01:42.733,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And those white shapes that you can see,

31
0:01:45.497,000 --> 0:01:47,000
they're all of the hospitals and hospices

32
0:01:48.43,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and mortuaries and cemeteries in the city.

33
0:01:51.185,000 --> 0:01:53,000
In fact, the majority are cemeteries.

34
0:01:53.652,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We wanted to show that, even though death and burial are things

35
0:01:58.378,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that we might not think about,

36
0:01:59.893,000 --> 0:02:02,000
they're all around us, and they're important parts of our cities.

37
0:02:04.035,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So about half a million people die in the UK each year,

38
0:02:08.519,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and of those, around a quarter will want to be buried.

39
0:02:11.572,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But the UK, like many Western European countries,

40
0:02:15.536,000 --> 0:02:16,000
is running out of burial space,

41
0:02:17.235,000 --> 0:02:18,000
especially in the major cities.

42
0:02:19.67,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And the Greater London Authority has been aware of this for a while,

43
0:02:23.21,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and the main causes are population growth,

44
0:02:26.702,000 --> 0:02:28,000
the fact that existing cemeteries are almost full.

45
0:02:29.567,000 --> 0:02:33,000
There's a custom in the UK that graves are considered to be occupied forever,

46
0:02:33.898,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and there's also development pressure -- people want to use that same land

47
0:02:37.649,000 --> 0:02:4,000
to build houses or offices or shops.

48
0:02:41.896,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So they came up with a few solutions.

49
0:02:43.721,000 --> 0:02:47,000
They were like, well, maybe we can reuse those graves after 50 years.

50
0:02:47.788,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Or maybe we can bury people, like, four deep,

51
0:02:50.125,000 --> 0:02:52,000
so that four people can be buried in the same plot,

52
0:02:53.137,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and we can make more efficient use of the land that way,

53
0:02:55.804,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and in that way, hopefully London will still have space to bury people

54
0:02:59.168,000 --> 0:03:,000
in the near future.

55
0:03:01.106,000 --> 0:03:03,000
But, traditionally, cemeteries haven't been taken care of

56
0:03:03.792,000 --> 0:03:04,000
by the local authority.

57
0:03:05.556,000 --> 0:03:08,000
In fact, the surprising thing is that there's no legal obligation

58
0:03:08.946,000 --> 0:03:11,000
on anyone in the UK to provide burial space.

59
0:03:12.499,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Traditionally, it's been done by private and religious organizations,

60
0:03:17.306,000 --> 0:03:19,000
like churches and mosques and synagogues.

61
0:03:20.51,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But there's also occasionally been a for-profit group

62
0:03:24.459,000 --> 0:03:26,000
who has wanted to get in on the act.

63
0:03:26.5,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And, you know, they look at the small size of a burial plot

64
0:03:30.029,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and that high cost,

65
0:03:31.721,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and it looks like there's serious money to be made.

66
0:03:34.58,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So, actually, if you want to go out and start your own cemetery,

67
0:03:38.318,000 --> 0:03:39,000
you kind of can.

68
0:03:39.765,000 --> 0:03:41,000
There was this couple in South Wales,

69
0:03:41.925,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and they had a farmhouse and a load of fields next to it,

70
0:03:45.185,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and they wanted to develop the land.

71
0:03:47.34,000 --> 0:03:48,000
They had a load of ideas.

72
0:03:48.765,000 --> 0:03:51,000
They first thought about making a caravan park,

73
0:03:51.903,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but the council said no.

74
0:03:53.641,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And then they wanted to make a fish farm

75
0:03:55.633,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and again the council said no.

76
0:03:57.751,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Then they hit on the idea of making a cemetery

77
0:04:00.446,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and they calculated that by doing this,

78
0:04:02.526,000 --> 0:04:04,000
they could increase the value of their land

79
0:04:05.067,000 --> 0:04:09,000
from about 95,000 pounds to over one million pounds.

80
0:04:10.802,000 --> 0:04:14,000
But just to come back to this idea of making profit from cemeteries,

81
0:04:15.585,000 --> 0:04:17,000
like, it's kind of ludicrous, right?

82
0:04:18.267,000 --> 0:04:21,000
The thing is that the high cost of those burial plots

83
0:04:21.804,000 --> 0:04:23,000
is actually very misleading.

84
0:04:23.944,000 --> 0:04:24,000
They look like they're expensive,

85
0:04:25.755,000 --> 0:04:29,000
but that cost reflects the fact that you need to maintain the burial plot --

86
0:04:29.981,000 --> 0:04:32,000
like, someone has to cut the grass for the next 50 years.

87
0:04:33.313,000 --> 0:04:35,000
That means it's very difficult to make money from cemeteries.

88
0:04:36.234,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And it's the reason that normally they're run by the council

89
0:04:39.083,000 --> 0:04:4,000
or by a not-for-profit group.

90
0:04:41.103,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But anyway, the council granted these people permission,

91
0:04:43.778,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and they're now trying to build their cemetery.

92
0:04:46.253,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So just to explain to you kind of how this works:

93
0:04:49.597,000 --> 0:04:51,000
If I want to build something in the UK,

94
0:04:51.678,000 --> 0:04:53,000
like a cemetery for example,

95
0:04:53.894,000 --> 0:04:55,000
then I have to apply for planning permission first.

96
0:04:56.892,000 --> 0:05:,000
So if I want to build a new office building for a client

97
0:05:01.126,000 --> 0:05:03,000
or if I want to extend my home

98
0:05:03.404,000 --> 0:05:06,000
or, you know, if I have a shop and I want to convert it into an office,

99
0:05:07.197,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I have to do a load of drawings,

100
0:05:08.752,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and I submit them to the council for permission.

101
0:05:11.212,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And they'll look at things like how it fits in the surroundings.

102
0:05:15.193,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So they'll look at what it looks like.

103
0:05:17.249,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But they'll also think about things like what impact is it going to have

104
0:05:20.869,000 --> 0:05:21,000
on the local environment?

105
0:05:22.368,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And they'll be thinking about things like,

106
0:05:24.432,000 --> 0:05:25,000
is this thing going to cause pollution

107
0:05:26.297,000 --> 0:05:27,000
or is there going to be a lot of traffic

108
0:05:28.249,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that wants to go to this thing that I've built?

109
0:05:30.606,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But also good things.

110
0:05:32.01,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Is it going to add local services like shops to the neighborhood

111
0:05:35.351,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that local people would like to use?

112
0:05:38.183,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And they'll weigh up the advantages and the disadvantages

113
0:05:40.901,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and they'll make a decision.

114
0:05:42.908,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So that's how it works if I want to build a large cemetery.

115
0:05:47.356,000 --> 0:05:48,000
But what if I've got a piece of land

116
0:05:49.374,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and I just want to bury a few people, like five or six?

117
0:05:53.533,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Well, then -- actually, I don't need permission from anyone!

118
0:05:57.85,000 --> 0:06:01,000
There's actually almost no regulation in the UK around burial,

119
0:06:02.24,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and the little bit that there is, is about not polluting water courses,

120
0:06:05.907,000 --> 0:06:07,000
like not polluting rivers or groundwater.

121
0:06:08.962,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So actually, if you want to go and make your own mini-cemetery,

122
0:06:12.01,000 --> 0:06:13,000
then you can.

123
0:06:13.329,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But I mean, like -- really, who does this? Right?

124
0:06:18.011,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Well, if you're an aristocratic family and you have a large estate,

125
0:06:21.653,000 --> 0:06:23,000
then there's a chance that you'll have a mausoleum on it,

126
0:06:24.36,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and you'll bury your family there.

127
0:06:26.708,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But the really weird thing

128
0:06:28.891,000 --> 0:06:31,000
is that you don't need to have a piece of land of a certain size

129
0:06:32.284,000 --> 0:06:34,000
before you're allowed to start burying people on it.

130
0:06:34.91,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And so that means that, technically,

131
0:06:36.879,000 --> 0:06:39,000
this applies to, like, the back garden of your house in the suburbs.

132
0:06:40.592,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Laughter)

133
0:06:42.37,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So what if you wanted to try this yourself at home?

134
0:06:46.418,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Well, there's a few councils that have guidance on their website

135
0:06:50.49,000 --> 0:06:51,000
which can help you.

136
0:06:51.901,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So, the first thing that they tell you

137
0:06:54.019,000 --> 0:06:57,000
is that you need to have a certificate of burial before you can go ahead --

138
0:06:57.779,000 --> 0:07:,000
you're not allowed to just murder people and put them under the patio.

139
0:07:01.151,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Laughter)

140
0:07:04.253,000 --> 0:07:07,000
They also tell you that you need to keep a record of where the grave is.

141
0:07:08.08,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But that's pretty much it for formal requirements.

142
0:07:10.737,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Now, they do warn you that your neighbors might not like this,

143
0:07:13.763,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but, legally speaking, there's almost nothing that they can do about it.

144
0:07:17.69,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And just in case any of you still had that profit idea in your mind

145
0:07:22.88,000 --> 0:07:24,000
about how much those burial plots cost

146
0:07:25.165,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and how much money you might be able to make,

147
0:07:27.537,000 --> 0:07:29,000
they also warn that it might cause the value of your house

148
0:07:30.307,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to drop by 20 percent.

149
0:07:32.515,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Although, actually, it's more likely

150
0:07:34.286,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that no one will want to buy your house at all after that.

151
0:07:38.341,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So what I find fascinating about this

152
0:07:40.924,000 --> 0:07:44,000
is the fact that it kind of sums up many of our attitudes towards death.

153
0:07:46.28,000 --> 0:07:5,000
In the UK, and I think that the figures across Europe are probably similar,

154
0:07:50.72,000 --> 0:07:53,000
only about 30 percent of people have ever talked to anyone

155
0:07:53.855,000 --> 0:07:54,000
about their wishes around death,

156
0:07:55.571,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and even for people over 75,

157
0:07:57.505,000 --> 0:08:,000
only 45 percent of people have ever talked about this.

158
0:08:01.464,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And the reasons that people give ... you know,

159
0:08:04.163,000 --> 0:08:05,000
they think that their death is far off

160
0:08:06.008,000 --> 0:08:08,000
or they think that they're going to make people uncomfortable

161
0:08:08.909,000 --> 0:08:09,000
by talking about it.

162
0:08:10.319,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And you know, to a certain extent,

163
0:08:12.098,000 --> 0:08:15,000
there are other people out there who are taking care of things for us.

164
0:08:15.76,000 --> 0:08:18,000
The government has all this regulation and bureaucracy around things

165
0:08:19.465,000 --> 0:08:21,000
like burying a death, for example,

166
0:08:21.722,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and there's people like funeral directors

167
0:08:23.715,000 --> 0:08:25,000
who devote their entire working lives to this issue.

168
0:08:26.335,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But when it comes to our cities

169
0:08:27.865,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and thinking about how death fits in our cities,

170
0:08:30.931,000 --> 0:08:34,000
there's much less regulation and design and thought

171
0:08:35.004,000 --> 0:08:36,000
than we might imagine.

172
0:08:36.344,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So we're not thinking about this,

173
0:08:38.582,000 --> 0:08:4,000
but all of the people we imagine are thinking about it --

174
0:08:41.506,000 --> 0:08:43,000
they're not taking care of it either.

175
0:08:43.575,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Thank you.

176
0:08:44.757,000 --> 0:08:46,000

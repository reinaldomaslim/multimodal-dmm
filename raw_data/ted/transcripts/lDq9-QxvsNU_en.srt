1
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Today, I'm going to take you

2
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
around the world in 18 minutes.

3
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
My base of operations is in the U.S.,

4
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but let's start at the other end of the map,

5
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in Kyoto, Japan,

6
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
where I was living with a Japanese family

7
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
while I was doing part of my dissertational research

8
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
15 years ago.

9
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I knew even then that I would encounter

10
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
cultural differences and misunderstandings,

11
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
but they popped up when I least expected it.

12
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
On my first day,

13
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I went to a restaurant,

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and I ordered a cup of green tea with sugar.

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
After a pause, the waiter said,

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
"One does not put sugar in green tea."

17
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
"I know," I said. "I'm aware of this custom.

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But I really like my tea sweet."

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
In response, he gave me an even more courteous version

20
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
of the same explanation.

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
"One does not put sugar

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
in green tea."

23
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
"I understand," I said,

24
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
"that the Japanese do not put sugar in their green tea,

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
but I'd like to put some sugar

26
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
in my green tea."

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Surprised by my insistence,

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the waiter took up the issue with the manager.

30
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Pretty soon,

31
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
a lengthy discussion ensued,

32
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and finally the manager came over to me and said,

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
"I am very sorry. We do not have sugar."

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Well, since I couldn't have my tea the way I wanted it,

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I ordered a cup of coffee,

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
which the waiter brought over promptly.

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Resting on the saucer

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
were two packets of sugar.

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
My failure to procure myself

41
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
a cup of sweet, green tea

42
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
was not due to a simple misunderstanding.

43
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
This was due to a fundamental difference

44
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
in our ideas about choice.

45
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
From my American perspective,

46
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
when a paying customer makes a reasonable request

47
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
based on her preferences,

48
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
she has every right to have that request met.

49
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
The American way, to quote Burger King,

50
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
is to "have it your way,"

51
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
because, as Starbucks says,

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
"happiness is in your choices."

53
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But from the Japanese perspective,

55
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better --

56
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
in this case, the ignorant gaijin --

58
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
from making the wrong choice.

59
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Let's face it: the way I wanted my tea

60
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
was inappropriate according to cultural standards,

61
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and they were doing their best to help me save face.

62
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Americans tend to believe

63
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that they've reached some sort of pinnacle

64
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
in the way they practice choice.

65
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
They think that choice, as seen through the American lens

66
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
best fulfills an innate and universal

67
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
desire for choice in all humans.

68
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Unfortunately,

69
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
these beliefs are based on assumptions

70
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that don't always hold true

71
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
in many countries, in many cultures.

72
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
At times they don't even hold true

73
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
at America's own borders.

74
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I'd like to discuss some of these assumptions

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and the problems associated with them.

76
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
As I do so, I hope you'll start thinking

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
about some of your own assumptions

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and how they were shaped by your backgrounds.

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
First assumption:

80
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
if a choice affects you,

81
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
then you should be the one to make it.

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
This is the only way to ensure

83
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that your preferences and interests

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
will be most fully accounted for.

85
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It is essential for success.

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
In America, the primary locus of choice

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
is the individual.

88
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
People must choose for themselves, sometimes sticking to their guns,

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
regardless of what other people want or recommend.

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
It's called "being true to yourself."

91
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But do all individuals benefit

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
from taking such an approach to choice?

93
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Mark Lepper and I did a series of studies

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
in which we sought the answer to this very question.

95
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
In one study,

96
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
which we ran in Japantown, San Francisco,

97
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
we brought seven- to nine-year-old Anglo- and Asian-American children

98
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
into the laboratory,

99
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and we divided them up into three groups.

100
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The first group came in,

101
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and they were greeted by Miss Smith,

102
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles.

103
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do,

104
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and they even got to choose which marker

105
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
they would write their answers with.

106
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
When the second group of children came in,

107
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
they were brought to the same room, shown the same anagrams,

108
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but this time Miss Smith told them

109
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
which anagrams to do

110
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and which markers to write their answers with.

111
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Now when the third group came in,

112
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
they were told that their anagrams and their markers

113
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
had been chosen by their mothers.

114
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
(Laughter)

115
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
In reality,

116
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the kids who were told what to do,

117
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
whether by Miss Smith or their mothers,

118
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
were actually given the very same activity,

119
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
which their counterparts in the first group

120
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
had freely chosen.

121
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
With this procedure, we were able to ensure

122
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that the kids across the three groups

123
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
all did the same activity,

124
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
making it easier for us to compare performance.

125
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Such small differences in the way we administered the activity

126
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
yielded striking differences

127
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
in how well they performed.

128
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Anglo-Americans,

129
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
they did two and a half times more anagrams

130
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
when they got to choose them,

131
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
as compared to when it was

132
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
chosen for them by Miss Smith or their mothers.

133
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It didn't matter who did the choosing,

134
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
if the task was dictated by another,

135
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
their performance suffered.

136
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
In fact, some of the kids were visibly embarrassed

137
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
when they were told that their mothers had been consulted.

138
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Laughter)

139
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
One girl named Mary said,

140
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
"You asked my mother?"

141
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
(Laughter)

142
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
In contrast,

143
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Asian-American children

144
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
performed best when they believed

145
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
their mothers had made the choice,

146
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
second best when they chose for themselves,

147
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and least well when it had been chosen by Miss Smith.

148
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
A girl named Natsumi

149
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
even approached Miss Smith as she was leaving the room

150
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and tugged on her skirt and asked,

151
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
"Could you please tell my mommy

152
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I did it just like she said?"

153
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The first-generation children were strongly influenced

154
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
by their immigrant parents'

155
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
approach to choice.

156
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
For them, choice was not just a way

157
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
of defining and asserting

158
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
their individuality,

159
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but a way to create community and harmony

160
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
by deferring to the choices

161
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
of people whom they trusted and respected.

162
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
If they had a concept of being true to one's self,

163
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
then that self, most likely,

164
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
[was] composed, not of an individual,

165
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but of a collective.

166
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Success was just as much about pleasing key figures

167
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
as it was about satisfying

168
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
one's own preferences.

169
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
Or, you could say that

170
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
the individual's preferences were shaped

171
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
by the preferences of specific others.

172
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
The assumption then that we do best

173
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
when the individual self chooses

174
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
only holds

175
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
when that self

176
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
is clearly divided from others.

177
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
When, in contrast,

178
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
two or more individuals

179
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
see their choices and their outcomes

180
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
as intimately connected,

181
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
then they may amplify one another's success

182
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
by turning choosing

183
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
into a collective act.

184
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
To insist that they choose independently

185
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
might actually compromise

186
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
both their performance

187
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and their relationships.

188
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Yet that is exactly what

189
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
the American paradigm demands.

190
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It leaves little room for interdependence

191
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility.

192
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It requires that everyone treat choice

193
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
as a private and self-defining act.

194
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
People that have grown up in such a paradigm

195
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
might find it motivating,

196
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
but it is a mistake to assume

197
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that everyone thrives under the pressure

198
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
of choosing alone.

199
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The second assumption which informs the American view of choice

200
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
goes something like this.

201
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
The more choices you have,

202
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
the more likely you are

203
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to make the best choice.

204
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So bring it on, Walmart, with 100,000 different products,

205
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and Amazon, with 27 million books

206
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and Match.com with -- what is it? --

207
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
15 million date possibilities now.

208
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
You will surely find the perfect match.

209
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Let's test this assumption

210
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
by heading over to Eastern Europe.

211
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Here, I interviewed people

212
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
who were residents of formerly communist countries,

213
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
who had all faced the challenge

214
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
of transitioning to a more

215
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
democratic and capitalistic society.

216
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
One of the most interesting revelations

217
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
came not from an answer to a question,

218
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but from a simple gesture of hospitality.

219
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
When the participants arrived for their interview,

220
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I offered them a set of drinks:

221
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite --

222
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
seven, to be exact.

223
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
During the very first session,

224
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
which was run in Russia,

225
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
one of the participants made a comment

226
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that really caught me off guard.

227
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
"Oh, but it doesn't matter.

228
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It's all just soda. That's just one choice."

229
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
(Murmuring)

230
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I was so struck by this comment that from then on,

231
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I started to offer all the participants

232
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
those seven sodas,

233
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and I asked them, "How many choices are these?"

234
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Again and again,

235
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
they perceived these seven different sodas,

236
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
not as seven choices, but as one choice:

237
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
soda or no soda.

238
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
When I put out juice and water

239
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
in addition to these seven sodas,

240
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
now they perceived it as only three choices --

241
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
juice, water and soda.

242
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Compare this to the die-hard devotion of many Americans,

243
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
not just to a particular flavor of soda,

244
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
but to a particular brand.

245
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
You know, research shows repeatedly

246
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that we can't actually tell the difference

247
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
between Coke and Pepsi.

248
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Of course, you and I know

249
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
that Coke is the better choice.

250
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Laughter)

251
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
For modern Americans who are exposed

252
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
to more options and more ads associated with options

253
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
than anyone else in the world,

254
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
choice is just as much about who they are

255
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
as it is about what the product is.

256
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better,

257
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters

258
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and so every choice matters.

259
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
But for Eastern Europeans,

260
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
the sudden availability of all these

261
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
consumer products on the marketplace was a deluge.

262
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
They were flooded with choice

263
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
before they could protest that they didn't know how to swim.

264
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
When asked, "What words and images

265
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
do you associate with choice?"

266
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Grzegorz from Warsaw said,

267
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
"Ah, for me it is fear.

268
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
There are some dilemmas you see.

269
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I am used to no choice."

270
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Bohdan from Kiev said,

271
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
in response to how he felt about

272
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
the new consumer marketplace,

273
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
"It is too much.

274
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
We do not need everything that is there."

275
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
A sociologist from

276
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
the Warsaw Survey Agency explained,

277
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
"The older generation jumped from nothing

278
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
to choice all around them.

279
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
They were never given a chance to learn

280
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
how to react."

281
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And Tomasz, a young Polish man said,

282
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
"I don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum.

283
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I don't mean to say that I want no choice,

284
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
but many of these choices are quite artificial."

285
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
In reality, many choices are between things

286
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that are not that much different.

287
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
The value of choice

288
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
depends on our ability

289
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
to perceive differences

290
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
between the options.

291
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Americans train their whole lives

292
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
to play "spot the difference."

293
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
They practice this from such an early age

294
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
that they've come to believe that everyone

295
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
must be born with this ability.

296
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
In fact, though all humans share

297
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
a basic need and desire for choice,

298
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
we don't all see choice in the same places

299
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
or to the same extent.

300
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
When someone can't see how one choice

301
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
is unlike another,

302
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast,

303
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
the process of choosing can be

304
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
confusing and frustrating.

305
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Instead of making better choices,

306
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
we become overwhelmed by choice,

307
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
sometimes even afraid of it.

308
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Choice no longer offers opportunities,

309
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
but imposes constraints.

310
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
It's not a marker of liberation,

311
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
but of suffocation

312
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
by meaningless minutiae.

313
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
In other words,

314
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
choice can develop into the very opposite

315
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
of everything it represents

316
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
in America

317
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
when it is thrust upon those

318
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
who are insufficiently prepared for it.

319
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
But it is not only other people

320
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
in other places

321
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that are feeling the pressure

322
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
of ever-increasing choice.

323
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Americans themselves are discovering

324
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
that unlimited choice

325
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
seems more attractive in theory

326
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
than in practice.

327
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
We all have physical, mental

328
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and emotional (Laughter) limitations

329
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
that make it impossible for us

330
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
to process every single choice we encounter,

331
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
even in the grocery store,

332
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
let alone over the course of our entire lives.

333
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
A number of my studies have shown

334
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that when you give people 10 or more options

335
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
when they're making a choice, they make poorer decisions,

336
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
whether it be health care, investment,

337
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
other critical areas.

338
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Yet still, many of us believe

339
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
that we should make all our own choices

340
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and seek out even more of them.

341
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
This brings me to the third,

342
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and perhaps most problematic, assumption:

343
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
"You must never

344
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
say no to choice."

345
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
To examine this, let's go back to the U.S.

346
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and then hop across the pond to France.

347
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Right outside Chicago,

348
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
a young couple, Susan and Daniel Mitchell,

349
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
were about to have their first baby.

350
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
They'd already picked out a name for her,

351
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Barbara, after her grandmother.

352
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
One night, when Susan was seven months pregnant,

353
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
she started to experience contractions

354
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and was rushed to the emergency room.

355
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
The baby was delivered through a C-section,

356
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
but Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia,

357
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
a loss of oxygen to the brain.

358
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Unable to breathe on her own,

359
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
she was put on a ventilator.

360
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Two days later,

361
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
the doctors gave the Mitchells

362
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
a choice:

363
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
They could either remove Barbara

364
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
off the life support,

365
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
in which case she would die within a matter of hours,

366
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
or they could keep her on life support,

367
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
in which case she might still die

368
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
within a matter of days.

369
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
If she survived, she would remain

370
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
in a permanent vegetative state,

371
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
never able to walk, talk

372
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
or interact with others.

373
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
What do they do?

374
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
What do any parent do?

375
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
In a study I conducted

376
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
with Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali,

377
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
American and French parents

378
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
were interviewed.

379
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
They had all suffered

380
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
the same tragedy.

381
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
In all cases, the life support was removed,

382
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and the infants had died.

383
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
But there was a big difference.

384
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
In France, the doctors decided whether and when

385
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
the life support would be removed,

386
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
while in the United States,

387
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
the final decision rested with the parents.

388
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
We wondered:

389
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
does this have an effect on how the parents

390
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
cope with the loss of their loved one?

391
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
We found that it did.

392
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
Even up to a year later,

393
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
American parents

394
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
were more likely to express negative emotions,

395
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
as compared to their French counterparts.

396
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
French parents were more likely to say things like,

397
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
"Noah was here for so little time,

398
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
but he taught us so much.

399
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
He gave us a new perspective on life."

400
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
American parents were more likely to say things like,

401
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
"What if? What if?"

402
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Another parent complained,

403
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
"I feel as if they purposefully tortured me.

404
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
How did they get me to do that?"

405
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
And another parent said,

406
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
"I feel as if I've played a role

407
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
in an execution."

408
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
But when the American parents were asked

409
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
if they would rather have had

410
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
the doctors make the decision,

411
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
they all said, "No."

412
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
They could not imagine

413
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
turning that choice over to another,

414
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
even though having made that choice

415
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
made them feel trapped,

416
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
guilty, angry.

417
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
In a number of cases

418
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
they were even clinically depressed.

419
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
These parents could not contemplate

420
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
giving up the choice,

421
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
because to do so would have gone contrary

422
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
to everything they had been taught

423
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and everything they had come to believe

424
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
about the power

425
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and purpose of choice.

426
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
In her essay, "The White Album,"

427
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Joan Didion writes,

428
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
"We tell ourselves stories

429
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
in order to live.

430
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
We interpret what we see,

431
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
select the most workable

432
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
of the multiple choices.

433
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
We live entirely by the imposition

434
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
of a narrative line

435
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
upon disparate images,

436
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
by the idea with which we have learned to freeze

437
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
the shifting phantasmagoria,

438
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
which is our actual experience."

439
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
The story Americans tell,

440
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
the story upon which

441
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
the American dream depends,

442
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
is the story of limitless choice.

443
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
This narrative

444
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
promises so much:

445
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
freedom, happiness,

446
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
success.

447
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
It lays the world at your feet and says,

448
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
"You can have anything, everything."

449
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
It's a great story,

450
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
and it's understandable why they would be reluctant

451
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
to revise it.

452
0:18:24.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
But when you take a close look,

453
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
you start to see the holes,

454
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
and you start to see that the story

455
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
can be told in many other ways.

456
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
Americans have so often tried to

457
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
disseminate their ideas of choice,

458
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
believing that they will be, or ought to be,

459
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
welcomed with open hearts and minds.

460
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:47,000
But the history books and the daily news tell us

461
0:18:47.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
it doesn't always work out that way.

462
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
The phantasmagoria,

463
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
the actual experience that we try to understand

464
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
and organize through narrative,

465
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:19:,000
varies from place to place.

466
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
No single narrative serves the needs

467
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:05,000
of everyone everywhere.

468
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
Moreover, Americans themselves

469
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
could benefit from incorporating

470
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
new perspectives into their own narrative,

471
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:17,000
which has been driving their choices

472
0:19:17.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
for so long.

473
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:23,000
Robert Frost once said that,

474
0:19:23.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
"It is poetry that is lost in translation."

475
0:19:27.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
This suggests that

476
0:19:29.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
whatever is beautiful and moving,

477
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:34,000
whatever gives us a new way to see,

478
0:19:34.26,000 --> 0:19:36,000
cannot be communicated to those

479
0:19:36.26,000 --> 0:19:39,000
who speak a different language.

480
0:19:39.26,000 --> 0:19:41,000
But Joseph Brodsky said that,

481
0:19:41.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
"It is poetry

482
0:19:43.26,000 --> 0:19:45,000
that is gained in translation,"

483
0:19:45.26,000 --> 0:19:47,000
suggesting that translation

484
0:19:47.26,000 --> 0:19:49,000
can be a creative,

485
0:19:49.26,000 --> 0:19:52,000
transformative act.

486
0:19:52.26,000 --> 0:19:54,000
When it comes to choice,

487
0:19:54.26,000 --> 0:19:57,000
we have far more to gain than to lose

488
0:19:57.26,000 --> 0:20:,000
by engaging in the many

489
0:20:00.26,000 --> 0:20:03,000
translations of the narratives.

490
0:20:03.26,000 --> 0:20:05,000
Instead of replacing

491
0:20:05.26,000 --> 0:20:07,000
one story with another,

492
0:20:07.26,000 --> 0:20:09,000
we can learn from and revel in

493
0:20:09.26,000 --> 0:20:12,000
the many versions that exist

494
0:20:12.26,000 --> 0:20:15,000
and the many that have yet to be written.

495
0:20:15.26,000 --> 0:20:18,000
No matter where we're from

496
0:20:18.26,000 --> 0:20:2,000
and what your narrative is,

497
0:20:20.26,000 --> 0:20:22,000
we all have a responsibility

498
0:20:22.26,000 --> 0:20:24,000
to open ourselves up to a wider array

499
0:20:24.26,000 --> 0:20:27,000
of what choice can do,

500
0:20:27.26,000 --> 0:20:3,000
and what it can represent.

501
0:20:30.26,000 --> 0:20:32,000
And this does not lead to

502
0:20:32.26,000 --> 0:20:35,000
a paralyzing moral relativism.

503
0:20:35.26,000 --> 0:20:37,000
Rather, it teaches us when

504
0:20:37.26,000 --> 0:20:39,000
and how to act.

505
0:20:39.26,000 --> 0:20:41,000
It brings us that much closer

506
0:20:41.26,000 --> 0:20:44,000
to realizing the full potential of choice,

507
0:20:44.26,000 --> 0:20:46,000
to inspiring the hope

508
0:20:46.26,000 --> 0:20:48,000
and achieving the freedom

509
0:20:48.26,000 --> 0:20:5,000
that choice promises

510
0:20:50.26,000 --> 0:20:52,000
but doesn't always deliver.

511
0:20:52.26,000 --> 0:20:55,000
If we learn to speak to one another,

512
0:20:55.26,000 --> 0:20:58,000
albeit through translation,

513
0:20:58.26,000 --> 0:21:,000
then we can begin to see choice

514
0:21:00.26,000 --> 0:21:02,000
in all its strangeness,

515
0:21:02.26,000 --> 0:21:05,000
complexity

516
0:21:05.26,000 --> 0:21:07,000
and compelling beauty.

517
0:21:07.26,000 --> 0:21:09,000
Thank you.

518
0:21:09.26,000 --> 0:21:2,000
(Applause)

519
0:21:20.26,000 --> 0:21:23,000
Bruno Giussani: Thank you.

520
0:21:23.26,000 --> 0:21:26,000
Sheena, there is a detail about your biography

521
0:21:26.26,000 --> 0:21:28,000
that we have not written in the program book.

522
0:21:28.26,000 --> 0:21:31,000
But by now it's evident to everyone in this room. You're blind.

523
0:21:31.26,000 --> 0:21:34,000
And I guess one of the questions on everybody's mind is:

524
0:21:34.26,000 --> 0:21:37,000
How does that influence your study of choosing

525
0:21:37.26,000 --> 0:21:39,000
because that's an activity

526
0:21:39.26,000 --> 0:21:42,000
that for most people is associated with visual inputs

527
0:21:42.26,000 --> 0:21:45,000
like aesthetics and color and so on?

528
0:21:46.26,000 --> 0:21:48,000
Sheena Iyengar: Well, it's funny that you should ask that

529
0:21:48.26,000 --> 0:21:51,000
because one of the things that's interesting about being blind

530
0:21:51.26,000 --> 0:21:53,000
is you actually get a different vantage point

531
0:21:53.26,000 --> 0:21:55,000
when you observe the way

532
0:21:55.26,000 --> 0:21:57,000
sighted people make choices.

533
0:21:57.26,000 --> 0:21:59,000
And as you just mentioned, there's lots of choices out there

534
0:21:59.26,000 --> 0:22:01,000
that are very visual these days.

535
0:22:01.26,000 --> 0:22:03,000
Yeah, I -- as you would expect --

536
0:22:03.26,000 --> 0:22:05,000
get pretty frustrated by choices

537
0:22:05.26,000 --> 0:22:07,000
like what nail polish to put on

538
0:22:07.26,000 --> 0:22:09,000
because I have to rely on what other people suggest.

539
0:22:09.26,000 --> 0:22:11,000
And I can't decide.

540
0:22:11.26,000 --> 0:22:13,000
And so one time I was in a beauty salon,

541
0:22:13.26,000 --> 0:22:16,000
and I was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink.

542
0:22:16.26,000 --> 0:22:18,000
And one was called "Ballet Slippers."

543
0:22:18.26,000 --> 0:22:21,000
And the other one was called "Adorable."

544
0:22:21.26,000 --> 0:22:23,000
(Laughter)

545
0:22:23.26,000 --> 0:22:25,000
And so I asked these two ladies,

546
0:22:25.26,000 --> 0:22:27,000
and the one lady told me, "Well, you should definitely wear 'Ballet Slippers.'"

547
0:22:27.26,000 --> 0:22:29,000
"Well, what does it look like?"

548
0:22:29.26,000 --> 0:22:31,000
"Well, it's a very elegant shade of pink."

549
0:22:31.26,000 --> 0:22:33,000
"Okay, great."

550
0:22:33.26,000 --> 0:22:35,000
The other lady tells me to wear "Adorable."

551
0:22:35.26,000 --> 0:22:37,000
"What does it look like?"

552
0:22:37.26,000 --> 0:22:4,000
"It's a glamorous shade of pink."

553
0:22:41.26,000 --> 0:22:43,000
And so I asked them, "Well, how do I tell them apart?

554
0:22:43.26,000 --> 0:22:45,000
What's different about them?"

555
0:22:45.26,000 --> 0:22:47,000
And they said, "Well, one is elegant, the other one's glamorous."

556
0:22:47.26,000 --> 0:22:49,000
Okay, we got that.

557
0:22:49.26,000 --> 0:22:51,000
And the only thing they had consensus on:

558
0:22:51.26,000 --> 0:22:53,000
well, if I could see them, I would

559
0:22:53.26,000 --> 0:22:55,000
clearly be able to tell them apart.

560
0:22:55.26,000 --> 0:22:57,000
(Laughter)

561
0:22:57.26,000 --> 0:23:,000
And what I wondered was whether they were being affected

562
0:23:00.26,000 --> 0:23:02,000
by the name or the content of the color,

563
0:23:02.26,000 --> 0:23:05,000
so I decided to do a little experiment.

564
0:23:05.26,000 --> 0:23:08,000
So I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory,

565
0:23:08.26,000 --> 0:23:1,000
and I stripped the labels off.

566
0:23:10.26,000 --> 0:23:12,000
And I brought women into the laboratory,

567
0:23:12.26,000 --> 0:23:14,000
and I asked them, "Which one would you pick?"

568
0:23:14.26,000 --> 0:23:17,000
50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick,

569
0:23:17.26,000 --> 0:23:19,000
of putting the same color nail polish

570
0:23:19.26,000 --> 0:23:21,000
in both those bottles.

571
0:23:21.26,000 --> 0:23:23,000
(Laughter)

572
0:23:23.26,000 --> 0:23:27,000
(Applause)

573
0:23:27.26,000 --> 0:23:3,000
At which point you start to wonder who the trick's really played on.

574
0:23:30.26,000 --> 0:23:33,000
Now, of the women that could tell them apart,

575
0:23:33.26,000 --> 0:23:36,000
when the labels were off, they picked "Adorable,"

576
0:23:36.26,000 --> 0:23:38,000
and when the labels were on,

577
0:23:38.26,000 --> 0:23:41,000
they picked "Ballet Slippers."

578
0:23:41.26,000 --> 0:23:43,000
So as far as I can tell,

579
0:23:43.26,000 --> 0:23:45,000
a rose by any other name

580
0:23:45.26,000 --> 0:23:47,000
probably does look different

581
0:23:47.26,000 --> 0:23:5,000
and maybe even smells different.

582
0:23:50.26,000 --> 0:23:53,000
BG: Thank you. Sheena Iyengar. Thank you Sheena.

583
0:23:53.26,000 --> 0:24:01,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.317,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I am an astrophysicist.

2
0:00:15.833,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I research stellar explosions across the universe.

3
0:00:19.603,000 --> 0:00:2,000
But I have a flaw:

4
0:00:21.325,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I'm restless, and I get bored easily.

5
0:00:24.356,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And although as an astrophysicist, I have the incredible opportunity

6
0:00:27.576,000 --> 0:00:28,000
to study the entire universe,

7
0:00:29.532,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the thought of doing only that, always that,

8
0:00:32.904,000 --> 0:00:34,000
makes me feel caged and limited.

9
0:00:36.762,000 --> 0:00:39,000
What if my issues with keeping attention and getting bored

10
0:00:40.7,000 --> 0:00:41,000
were not a flaw, though?

11
0:00:42.206,000 --> 0:00:44,000
What if I could turn them into an asset?

12
0:00:45.83,000 --> 0:00:47,000
An astrophysicist cannot touch or interact with

13
0:00:48.499,000 --> 0:00:49,000
the things that she studies.

14
0:00:50.061,000 --> 0:00:53,000
No way to explode a star in a lab to figure out why or how it blew up.

15
0:00:54.164,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Just pictures and movies of the sky.

16
0:00:57.339,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Everything we know about the universe,

17
0:00:59.584,000 --> 0:01:02,000
from the big bang that originated space and time,

18
0:01:02.699,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies,

19
0:01:05.517,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to the structure of our own solar system,

20
0:01:08.001,000 --> 0:01:1,000
we figured out studying images of the sky.

21
0:01:12.006,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And to study a system as complex as the entire universe,

22
0:01:15.982,000 --> 0:01:19,000
astrophysicists are experts at extracting simple models and solutions

23
0:01:20.711,000 --> 0:01:22,000
from large and complex data sets.

24
0:01:23.705,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So what else can I do with this expertise?

25
0:01:28.03,000 --> 0:01:32,000
What if we turned the camera around towards us?

26
0:01:33.057,000 --> 0:01:35,000
At the Urban Observatory, that is exactly what we are doing.

27
0:01:36.072,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Greg Dobler, also an astrophysicist

28
0:01:38.588,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and my husband,

29
0:01:39.779,000 --> 0:01:42,000
created the first urban observatory in New York University in 2013,

30
0:01:43.763,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and I joined in 2015.

31
0:01:45.752,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Here are some of the things that we do.

32
0:01:48.196,000 --> 0:01:5,000
We take pictures of the city at night

33
0:01:50.49,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and study city lights like stars.

34
0:01:53.514,000 --> 0:01:55,000
By studying how light changes over time

35
0:01:55.55,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and the color of astronomical lights,

36
0:01:57.648,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I gain insight about the nature of exploding stars.

37
0:02:00.934,000 --> 0:02:02,000
By studying city lights the same way,

38
0:02:03.228,000 --> 0:02:07,000
we can measure and predict how much energy the city needs and consumes

39
0:02:07.934,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and help build a resilient grid

40
0:02:09.805,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that will support the needs of growing urban environments.

41
0:02:14.283,000 --> 0:02:17,000
In daytime images, we capture plumes of pollution.

42
0:02:18.274,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Seventy-five percent of greenhouse gases in New York City

43
0:02:21.768,000 --> 0:02:24,000
come from a building like this one, burning oil for heat.

44
0:02:26.477,000 --> 0:02:28,000
You can measure pollution with air quality sensors.

45
0:02:28.896,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But imagine putting a sensor on each New York City building,

46
0:02:32.762,000 --> 0:02:34,000
reading in data from a million monitors.

47
0:02:35.492,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Imagine the cost.

48
0:02:38.048,000 --> 0:02:41,000
With a team of NYU students, we built a mathematical model,

49
0:02:41.5,000 --> 0:02:44,000
a neural network that can detect and track these plumes

50
0:02:44.913,000 --> 0:02:45,000
over the New York City skyline.

51
0:02:46.627,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We can classify them --

52
0:02:48.133,000 --> 0:02:51,000
harmless steam plumes, white and evanescent;

53
0:02:51.172,000 --> 0:02:54,000
polluting smokestacks, dark and persistent --

54
0:02:54.712,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and provide policy makers with a map of neighborhood pollution.

55
0:02:59.777,000 --> 0:03:02,000
This cross-disciplinary project created transformational solutions.

56
0:03:05.942,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But the data analysis methodologies we use in astrophysics

57
0:03:08.879,000 --> 0:03:09,000
can be applied to all sorts of data,

58
0:03:10.864,000 --> 0:03:11,000
not just images.

59
0:03:12.45,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We were asked to help a California district attorney

60
0:03:14.958,000 --> 0:03:17,000
understand prosecutorial delays in their jurisdiction.

61
0:03:18.839,000 --> 0:03:2,000
There are people on probation or sitting in jail,

62
0:03:21.53,000 --> 0:03:23,000
awaiting for trial sometimes for years.

63
0:03:24.165,000 --> 0:03:26,000
They wanted to know what kind of cases dragged on,

64
0:03:26.633,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and they had a massive data set to explore to understand it,

65
0:03:29.781,000 --> 0:03:3,000
but didn't have the expertise

66
0:03:31.217,000 --> 0:03:33,000
or the instruments in their office to do so.

67
0:03:33.789,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And that's where we came in.

68
0:03:35.559,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I worked with my colleague, public policy professor Angela Hawken,

69
0:03:38.98,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and our team first created a visual dashboard

70
0:03:42.49,000 --> 0:03:45,000
for DAs to see and better understand the prosecution process.

71
0:03:46.997,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But also, we ourselves analyzed their data,

72
0:03:49.95,000 --> 0:03:51,000
looking to see if the duration of the process

73
0:03:52.494,000 --> 0:03:55,000
suffered from social inequalities in their jurisdiction.

74
0:03:56.367,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We did so using methods

75
0:03:57.933,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that I would use to classify thousands of stellar explosions,

76
0:04:00.93,000 --> 0:04:02,000
applied to thousands of court cases.

77
0:04:03.609,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And in doing so,

78
0:04:04.784,000 --> 0:04:06,000
we built a model that can be applied to other jurisdictions

79
0:04:07.641,000 --> 0:04:09,000
who are willing to explore their biases.

80
0:04:09.855,000 --> 0:04:12,000
These collaborations between domain experts and astrophysicists

81
0:04:13.125,000 --> 0:04:15,000
created transformational solutions

82
0:04:15.204,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to help improve people's quality of life.

83
0:04:19.426,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But it is a two-way road.

84
0:04:20.934,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I bring my astrophysics background to urban science,

85
0:04:23.501,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and I bring what I learn in urban science back to astrophysics.

86
0:04:27.93,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Light echoes:

87
0:04:30.461,000 --> 0:04:34,000
the reflections of stellar explosions onto interstellar dust.

88
0:04:36.046,000 --> 0:04:41,000
In our images, these reflections appear as white, evanescent, moving features,

89
0:04:41.855,000 --> 0:04:42,000
just like plumes.

90
0:04:43.363,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I am adapting the same models that detect plumes in city images

91
0:04:47.282,000 --> 0:04:49,000
to detect light echoes in images of the sky.

92
0:04:52.29,000 --> 0:04:55,000
By exploring the things that interest and excite me,

93
0:04:55.607,000 --> 0:04:56,000
reaching outside of my domain,

94
0:04:57.427,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I did turn my restlessness into an asset.

95
0:05:01.031,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We, you, all have a unique perspective that can generate new insight

96
0:05:06.102,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and lead to new, unexpected, transformational solutions.

97
0:05:10.944,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Thank you.

98
0:05:12.13,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Applause)

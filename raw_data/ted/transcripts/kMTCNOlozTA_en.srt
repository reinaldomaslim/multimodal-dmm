1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The old story about climate protection is that it's costly,

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
or it would have been done already.

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
So government needs to make us do something painful to fix it.

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The new story about climate protection

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
is that it's not costly, but profitable.

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
This was a simple sign error,

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
because it's cheaper to save fuel than to buy fuel,

8
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
as is well known to companies that do it all the time --

9
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
for example, Dupont, SD micro electronics.

10
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Many other firms -- IBM -- are reducing their energy intensity

11
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
routinely six percent a year by fixing up their plants,

12
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and they get their money back in two or three years.

13
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
That's called a profit.

14
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Now, similarly, the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it,

15
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
it would be expensive, or we would have done it already,

16
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
because markets are essentially perfect.

17
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
If, of course, that were true, there would be no innovation,

18
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and nobody could make any money.

19
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But the new story about oil

20
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
is the government doesn't have to force us to do painful things to get off oil --

21
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
not just incrementally, but completely --

22
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
quite the contrary. The United States, for example,

23
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
can completely eliminate its use of oil

24
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and rejuvenate the economy at the same time,

25
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
led by business for profit,

26
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
because it's so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil

27
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
than to keep on buying it.

28
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
This process will also be catalyzed by the military

29
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict,

30
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
particularly over oil.

31
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
This thesis is set out in a book called "Winning the Oil Endgame"

32
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that four colleagues and I wrote

33
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and have posted for free at Oilendgame.com --

34
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
about 170,000 downloads so far.

35
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And it was co-sponsored by the Pentagon --

36
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
it's independent, it's peer-reviewed

37
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and all of the backup calculations are transparently posted for your perusal.

38
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Now, a bit of economic history, I think, may be helpful here.

39
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Around 1850, one of the biggest U.S. industries was whaling.

40
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And whale oil lit practically every building.

41
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But in the nine years before Drake struck oil, in 1859,

42
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
at least five-sixths of that whale oil-illuminating market disappeared,

43
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
thanks to fatal competitors, chiefly oil and gas made from coal,

44
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
to which the whalers had not been paying attention.

45
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So, very unexpectedly, they ran out of customers

46
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
before they ran out of whales.

47
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators

48
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and profit-maximizing capitalists.

49
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And it's funny -- it feels a bit like this now for oil.

51
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
We've been spending the last few decades

52
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
accumulating a very powerful backlog of technologies

53
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
for saving and substituting for oil,

54
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and no one had bothered to add them up before.

55
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So when we did, we found some very surprising things.

56
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Now, there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil.

57
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Both national competitiveness and national security are at risk.

58
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
On the competitiveness front,

59
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
we all know that Toyota has more market cap than the big three put together.

60
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And serious competition from Europe, from Korea,

61
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and next is China, which will soon be a major net exporter of cars.

62
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
How long do you think it will take before you can drive home your new

63
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
wally-badged Shanghai automotive super-efficient car?

64
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Maybe a decade, according to my friends in Detroit.

65
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
China has an energy policy

66
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
based on radical energy efficiency and leap-frog technology.

67
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
They're not going to export your uncle's Buick.

68
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And after that comes India.

69
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The point here is, these cars are going to be made super efficient.

70
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The question is, who will make them?

71
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Will we in the United States continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil,

72
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
or will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars?

73
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
That seems to make more sense.

74
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The more we keep on using the oil, particularly the imported oil,

75
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the more we face a very obvious array of problems.

76
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Our analysis assumes that they all cost nothing,

77
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
but nothing is not the right number.

78
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It could well be enough to double the oil price, for example.

79
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And one of the worst of these

80
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
is what it does to our standing in the world

81
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
if other countries think that everything we do is about oil,

82
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
if we have to treat countries that have oil

83
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
differently than countries that don't have oil.

84
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And our military get quite unhappy

85
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
with having to stand guard on pipelines in Far-off-istan

86
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
when what they actually signed up for

87
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
was to protect American citizens.

88
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
They don't like fighting over oil,

89
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
they don't like being in the sands

90
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and they don't like where the oil money goes

91
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and what sort of instability it creates.

92
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Now, in order to avoid these problems,

93
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
whatever you think they're worth, it's actually not that complicated.

94
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We can save half the oil by using it more efficiently,

95
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
at a cost of 12 dollars per saved barrel.

96
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And then we can replace the other half

97
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
with a combination of advanced bio-fuels and safe natural gas.

98
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And that costs on average under 18 dollars a barrel.

99
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And compared with the official forecast,

100
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that oil will cost 26 dollars a barrel in 2025,

101
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
which is half of what we've been paying lately,

102
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that will save 70 billion dollars a year, starting quite soon.

103
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Now, in order to do this we need to invest about 180 billion dollars:

104
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
half of it to retool the car, truck and plane industries;

105
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
half of it to build the advanced bio-fuel industry.

106
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
In the process, we will gain about a million good jobs, mainly rural.

107
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And protect another million jobs now at risk, mainly in auto-making.

108
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And we'll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year.

109
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So that's a very handsome return.

110
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It's financeable in the private capital market.

111
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
But if you want it for the reasons I just mentioned,

112
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to happen sooner and with higher confidence,

113
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
then -- and also to expand choice and manage risk --

114
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
then you might like some light-handed public policies

115
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that support rather than distorting or opposing the business logic.

116
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And these policies work fine without taxes, subsidies or mandates.

117
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
They make a little net money for the treasury.

118
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
They have a broad trans-ideological appeal,

119
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and because we want them actually to happen,

120
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
we figured out ways to do them

121
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that do not require much, if any, federal legislation,

122
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and can, indeed, be done administratively or at a state level.

123
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Just to illustrate what to do about the nub of the problem,

124
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
namely, light vehicles,

125
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
here are four ultra-light carbon-composite concept cars with low drag,

126
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and all but the one at the upper left have hybrid drive.

127
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
You can sort of have it all with these things.

128
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
For example, this Opel two-seater

129
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
does 155 miles an hour at 94 miles a gallon.

130
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
This muscle car from Toyota: 408 horsepower in an ultra-light

131
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that does zero to 60 in well under four seconds,

132
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and still gets 32 miles a gallon. I'll say more later about this.

133
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And in the upper left, a pioneering effort 14 years ago by GM --

134
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
84 miles a gallon without even using a hybrid, in a four-seater.

135
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Well, saving that fuel, 69 percent of the fuel in light vehicles

136
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
costs about 57 cents per saved gallon.

137
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But it's even a better deal for heavy trucks,

138
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
where you save a similar amount at 25 cents a gallon,

139
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
with better aerodynamics and tires and engines, and so on,

140
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and taking out weight so you can put it into payload.

141
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So you can double efficiency with a 60 percent internal rate of return.

142
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Then you can go even further, almost tripling efficiency

143
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
with some operational improvements,

144
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
double the big haulers' margins.

145
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull, and flip the market.

146
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
In the airplane business, it's again a similar story

147
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
where the first 20 percent fuel saving is free,

148
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
as Boeing is now demonstrating in its new Dreamliner.

149
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But then the next generation of planes saves about half.

150
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Again, much cheaper than buying the fuel.

151
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And if you go over the next 15 years or so to a blended-wing body,

152
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
kind of a flying wing with internal engines,

153
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
then you get about a factor three efficiency improvement

154
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
at comparable or lower cost.

155
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Let me focus a minute on the light vehicles, the cars and light trucks,

156
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
because we all know the most about those;

157
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
probably everybody here drives one.

158
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And yet we may not realize that in a standard sedan,

159
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
of all the fuel energy you feed into the car,

160
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
seven-eighths never gets to the wheels;

161
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
it's lost first in the engine, idling at zero miles a gallon,

162
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
the power train and accessories.

163
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So then of the energy that does get to the wheels,

164
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
only an eighth of it, half of that, goes to heat the tires on the road,

165
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
or to heat the air the car pushes aside.

166
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And only this little bit, only six percent

167
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
actually ends up accelerating the car

168
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and then heating the brakes when you stop.

169
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
In fact, since 95 percent of the weight you're moving is the car not the driver,

170
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
less than one percent of the fuel energy ends up moving the driver.

171
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
This is not very gratifying

172
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
after more than a century of devoted engineering effort.

173
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
(Laughter)

174
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
(Applause)

175
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Moreover, three-fourths of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car.

176
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And it's obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels

177
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
is going to avoid wasting another seven units of energy

178
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
getting that energy to the wheels.

179
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So there's huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter.

180
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And the reason this has not been very seriously examined before

181
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
is there was a common assumption in the industry that --

182
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
well, then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car,

183
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and it would cost a lot more to make,

184
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter

185
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium.

186
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
But these objections are now vanishing through advances in materials.

187
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
For example, we use a lot of carbon-fiber composites

188
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
in sporting goods.

189
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety.

190
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Here's a handmade McLaren SLR carbon car that got t-boned by a Golf.

191
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
The Golf was totaled.

192
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
The McLaren just popped off and scratched the side panel.

193
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
They'll pop it back on and fix the scratch later.

194
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
But if this McLaren were to run into a wall at 65 miles an hour,

195
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the entire crash energy would be absorbed

196
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
by a couple of woven carbon-fiber composite cones,

197
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
weighing a total of 15 pounds, hidden in the front end.

198
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Because these materials could actually absorb

199
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
six to 12 times as much energy per pound as steel,

200
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and do so a lot more smoothly.

201
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And this means we've just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight.

202
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
We could make cars bigger, which is protective, but make them light.

203
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Whereas if we made them heavy, they'd be both hostile and inefficient.

204
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And when you make them light in the right way,

205
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that can be simpler and cheaper to make.

206
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
You can end up saving money, and lives, and oil, all at the same time.

207
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
I showed here two years ago

208
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
a little bit about a design of your basic, uncompromised,

209
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
quintupled-efficiency suburban-assault vehicle --

210
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
(Laughter)

211
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
-- and this is a complete virtual design

212
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that is production-costed manufacturable.

213
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And the process needed to make it

214
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
is actually coming toward the market quite nicely.

215
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
We figured out a kind of a digital inkjet printer

216
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
for this very stiff, strong, carbon-composite material,

217
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and then ways to thermoform it,

218
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
because it's a combination of carbon and nylon,

219
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
into whatever complex shapes you want,

220
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
like the one just shown at the auto show by one of the tier-one suppliers.

221
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And the manufacturing you can do this way gets radically simplified.

222
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Because the auto body has only, say, 14 parts, instead of 100, 150.

223
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set,

224
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
instead of four expensive ones for stamping steel.

225
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Each of the parts can be easily lifted with no hoist.

226
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
They snap together like a kid's toy.

227
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
So you got rid of the body shop.

228
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And if you want, you can lay color in the mold, and get rid of the paint shop.

229
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Those are the two hardest and costliest parts of making a car.

230
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
So you end up with at least two-fifths lower capital intensity

231
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
than the leanest plant in the industry, which GM has in Lansing.

232
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
The plant also gets smaller.

233
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Now, when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil,

234
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
including buildings, industry, feedstocks and so on,

235
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
you find that of the 28 million barrels a day

236
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
the government says we will need in 2025,

237
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
well, about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then,

238
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over,

239
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel,

240
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
instead of 26 for buying the oil.

241
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And then another six can be made robustly, competitively,

242
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio-diesel,

243
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
without interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production.

244
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
There is a huge amount of gas to be saved,

245
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price.

246
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And here are some no-brainer substitutions of it, with lots left over.

247
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So much, in fact, that after you've handled the domestic oil forecast

248
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
from areas already approved,

249
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
you have only this little bit left, and let's see how we can meet that,

250
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
because there's a pretty flexible menu of ways.

251
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
We could, of course, buy more efficiency.

252
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Maybe you ought to buy efficiency at 26 bucks instead of 12.

253
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Or wait to capture the second half of it.

254
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Or we could, of course, just get this little bit

255
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
by continuing to import some Canadian and Mexican oil,

256
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
or the ethanol the Brazilians would love to sell us.

257
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
But they'll sell it to Japan and China instead,

258
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
because we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers, and they don't.

259
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance,

260
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
or if we used it as hydrogen, which is more profitable and efficient,

261
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
we'd get rid of the domestic oil too.

262
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And that doesn't even count, for example,

263
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
that available land in the Dakotas can cost effectively

264
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
make enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country.

265
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
So we have lots of options.

266
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And the choice of menu and timing is quite flexible.

267
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Now, to make this happen quicker and with higher confidence,

268
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
there is a few ways government could help.

269
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
For example, fee-bates, a combination of a fee and a rebate

270
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
in any size class of vehicle you want,

271
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
can increase the price of inefficient vehicles

272
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and correspondingly pay you a rebate for efficient vehicles.

273
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
You're not paid to change size class.

274
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
You are paid to pick efficiency within a size class,

275
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
in a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years of life-cycle fuel savings

276
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
rather than just the first two or three.

277
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
This expands choice rapidly in the market,

278
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and actually makes more money for automakers as well.

279
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
I'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country

280
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
by making it very cheaply possible for low-income families

281
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
to get efficient, reliable, warranted new cars

282
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
that they could otherwise never get.

283
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And for each car so financed, scrap almost one clunker,

284
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
preferably the dirtiest ones.

285
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
This creates a new million-car-a-year market for Detroit

286
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
from customers they weren't going to get otherwise,

287
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
because they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car.

288
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And Detroit will make money on every unit.

289
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
It turns out that if, say, African-American and white households

290
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
had the same car ownership,

291
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
it would cut employment disparity about in half

292
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
by providing better access to job opportunities.

293
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
So this is a huge social win, too.

294
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Governments buy hundreds of thousands of cars a year.

295
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
There are smart ways to buy them and to aggregate that purchasing power

296
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
to bring very efficient vehicles into the market faster.

297
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And we could even do an X Prize-style golden carrot

298
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
that's worth stretching further for.

299
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
For example, a billion-dollar prize for the first U.S. automaker

300
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
to sell 200,000 really advanced vehicles, like some you saw earlier.

301
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Then the legacy airlines can't afford to buy the efficient new planes

302
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
they desperately need to cut their fuel bills,

303
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
but if you felt philosophically you wanted to do anything about that,

304
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
there are ways to finance it.

305
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And at the same time to scrap inefficient old planes,

306
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
so that if they were otherwise to come back in the air,

307
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
they would waste more oil,

308
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and block the uptake of efficient, new planes.

309
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Those part inefficient planes

310
0:16:51.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
are worth more to society dead than alive.

311
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
We ought to take them out back and shoot them,

312
0:16:55.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
and put bounty hunters after them.

313
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
Then there's an important military role.

314
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
That in creating the move to high-volume,

315
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
low-cost commercial production of these kinds of materials,

316
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
or for that matter, ultra-light steels

317
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
that are a good backup technology,

318
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
the military can do the trick it did

319
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
in turning DARPAnet into the Internet.

320
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Just turn it over to the private sector, and we have an Internet.

321
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:23,000
The same for GPS.

322
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
The same for the modern semi-conductor industry.

323
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
That is, military science and technology that they need

324
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:33,000
can create the advanced materials-industrial cluster

325
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
that transforms its civilian economy and gets the country off oil,

326
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:39,000
which would be a huge contribution to eliminating conflict over oil

327
0:17:39.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
and advancing national and global security.

328
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Then we need to retool the car industry and do retraining,

329
0:17:46.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
and shift the convergence of the energy and ag-value chains

330
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:53,000
to shift faster from hydrocarbons to carbohydrates,

331
0:17:53.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and get out of our own way in other ways.

332
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
And make the transition to more efficient vehicles go faster.

333
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:02,000
But here's how the whole thing fits together.

334
0:18:02.16,000 --> 0:18:05,000
Instead of official forecasts of oil use

335
0:18:05.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
and oil imports going forever up,

336
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:11,000
they can turn down with the 12 dollars a barrel efficiency,

337
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
down steeply by adding the supply-side substitutions at 18 bucks,

338
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
all implemented at slower rates than we've done before when we paid attention.

339
0:18:19.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
And if we start adding tranches of hydrogen in there,

340
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:26,000
we are rapidly off imports and completely off oil in the 2040s.

341
0:18:26.16,000 --> 0:18:3,000
And the one thing I'd like to point out here is that we've done this before.

342
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
In this eight-year period, 1977 to 85, when we last paid attention,

343
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:4,000
the economy grew 27 percent, oil use fell 17 percent,

344
0:18:40.16,000 --> 0:18:45,000
oil imports fell 50 percent, oil imports from the Persian Gulf fell 87 percent.

345
0:18:45.16,000 --> 0:18:48,000
They would have been gone if we'd kept that up one more year.

346
0:18:48.16,000 --> 0:18:52,000
Well, that was with very old technologies and delivery methods.

347
0:18:52.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
We could rerun that play a lot better now.

348
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:58,000
And yet what we proved then is the U.S. has more market power than OPEC.

349
0:18:58.16,000 --> 0:19:,000
Ours is on the demand side.

350
0:19:00.16,000 --> 0:19:02,000
We are the Saudi Arabia of "nega-barrels." (Laughter)

351
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:06,000
We can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil.

352
0:19:07.16,000 --> 0:19:11,000
(Applause)

353
0:19:14.16,000 --> 0:19:17,000
Whatever your reason for wanting to do this,

354
0:19:17.16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
whether you're concerned about national security or price volatility --

355
0:19:20.16,000 --> 0:19:21,000
(Laughter)

356
0:19:21.16,000 --> 0:19:24,000
-- or jobs, or the planet, or your grand-kids,

357
0:19:24.16,000 --> 0:19:27,000
it seems to me that this is an oil endgame

358
0:19:27.16,000 --> 0:19:29,000
that we should all be playing to win.

359
0:19:29.16,000 --> 0:19:32,000
Please download your copy, and thank you very much.

360
0:19:32.16,000 --> 0:19:33,000

1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The Internet, the Web as we know it,

2
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the kind of Web -- the things we're all talking about --

3
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
is already less than 5,000 days old.

4
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So all of the things that we've seen come about,

5
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
starting, say, with satellite images of the whole Earth,

6
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
which we couldn't even imagine happening before,

7
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
all these things rolling into our lives,

8
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
just this abundance of things that are right before us,

9
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
sitting in front of our laptop, or our desktop.

10
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
This kind of cornucopia of stuff

11
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
just coming and never ending is amazing, and we're not amazed.

12
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It's really amazing that all this stuff is here.

13
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
It's in 5,000 days, all this stuff has come.

15
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And I know that 10 years ago,

16
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
if I had told you that this was all coming,

17
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
you would have said that that's impossible.

18
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
There's simply no economic model that that would be possible.

19
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And if I told you it was all coming for free,

20
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
you would say, this is simply -- you're dreaming.

21
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
You're a Californian utopian. You're a wild-eyed optimist.

22
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And yet it's here.

23
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The other thing that we know about it was that 10 years ago,

24
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
as I looked at what even Wired was talking about,

25
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
we thought it was going to be TV, but better.

26
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
That was the model. That was what everybody was suggesting

27
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
was going to be coming.

28
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And it turns out that that's not what it was.

29
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
First of all, it was impossible, and it's not what it was.

30
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And so one of the things that I think we're learning --

31
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
if you think about, like, Wikipedia,

32
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
it's something that was simply impossible.

33
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It's impossible in theory, but possible in practice.

34
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And if you take all these things that are impossible,

35
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I think one of the things that we're learning from this era,

36
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
from this last decade, is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible,

37
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
because we're unprepared for it.

38
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So, I'm curious about what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days.

39
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But if that's happened in the last 5,000 days,

40
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days?

41
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So, I have a kind of a simple story,

42
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making,

43
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
this thing that has happened in 5,000 days --

44
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that's all these computers, all these handhelds,

45
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
all these cell phones, all these laptops, all these servers --

46
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
basically what we're getting out of all these connections

47
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
is we're getting one machine.

48
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
If there is only one machine, and our little handhelds and devices

49
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
are actually just little windows into those machines,

50
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but that we're basically constructing a single, global machine.

51
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And so I began to think about that.

52
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And it turned out that this machine happens to be

53
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the most reliable machine that we've ever made.

54
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
It has not crashed; it's running uninterrupted.

55
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And there's almost no other machine that we've ever made

56
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that runs the number of hours, the number of days.

57
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
5,000 days without interruption -- that's just unbelievable.

58
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And of course, the Internet is longer than just 5,000 days;

59
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the Web is only 5,000 days.

60
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So, I was trying to basically make measurements.

61
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
What are the dimensions of this machine?

62
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are

63
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
all around the globe on all the computers.

64
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And there is a 100 billion clicks per day.

65
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And there's 55 trillion links between all the Web pages of the world.

66
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions,

67
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan, the photographer,

68
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
talking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless?

69
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Well, here's a list of them. They're hard to tell,

70
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
but there's one billion PC chips on the Internet,

71
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
if you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet.

72
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
There's two million emails per second.

73
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So it's a very big number.

74
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It's just a huge machine,

75
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet.

76
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So here's the specifications,

77
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it:

78
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
170 quadrillion transistors, 55 trillion links,

79
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
emails running at two megahertz itself,

80
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
31 kilohertz text messaging,

81
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
246 exabyte storage. That's a big disk.

82
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
That's a lot of storage, memory. Nine exabyte RAM.

83
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And the total traffic on this

84
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
is running at seven terabytes per second.

85
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Brewster was saying the Library of Congress is about twenty terabytes.

86
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So every second, half of the Library of Congress

87
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
is swooshing around in this machine. It's a big machine.

88
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So I did something else. I figured out 100 billion clicks per day,

89
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
55 trillion links is almost the same

90
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
as the number of synapses in your brain.

91
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
A quadrillion transistors is almost the same

92
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
as the number of neurons in your brain.

93
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
So to a first approximation, we have these things --

94
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
twenty petahertz synapse firings.

95
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Of course, the memory is really huge.

96
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
But to a first approximation, the size of this machine is the size --

97
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and its complexity, kind of -- to your brain.

98
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Because in fact, that's how your brain works -- in kind of the same way that the Web works.

99
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
However, your brain isn't doubling every two years.

100
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So if we say this machine right now that we've made

101
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
is about one HB, one human brain,

102
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
if we look at the rate that this is increasing,

103
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
30 years from now, there'll be six billion HBs.

104
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So by the year 2040, the total processing of this machine

105
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
will exceed a total processing power of humanity,

106
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in raw bits and stuff. And this is, I think, where

107
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Ray Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we're going to cross.

108
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
So, what about that? Well, here's a couple of things.

109
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I have three kind of general things

110
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I would like to say, three consequences of this.

111
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
First, that basically what this machine is doing is embodying.

112
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
We're giving it a body. And that's what we're going to do

113
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
in the next 5,000 days -- we're going to give this machine a body.

114
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And the second thing is, we're going to restructure its architecture.

115
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And thirdly, we're going to become completely codependent upon it.

116
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So let me go through those three things.

117
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
First of all, we have all these things in our hands.

118
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We think they're all separate devices,

119
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but in fact, every screen in the world

120
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
is looking into the one machine.

121
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
These are all basically portals into that one machine.

122
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
The second thing is that -- some people call this the cloud,

123
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and you're kind of touching the cloud with this.

124
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And so in some ways, all you really need is a cloudbook.

125
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And the cloudbook doesn't have any storage.

126
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It's wireless. It's always connected.

127
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
There's many things about it. It becomes very simple,

128
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
and basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine,

129
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
you're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way.

130
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So the machine is computing.

131
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And in some ways, it's sort of back

132
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
to the kind of old idea of centralized computing.

133
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
But everything, all the cameras, and the microphones,

134
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and the sensors in cars

135
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and everything is connected to this machine.

136
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And everything will go through the Web.

137
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And we're seeing that already with, say, phones.

138
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Right now, phones don't go through the Web,

139
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
but they are beginning to, and they will.

140
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And if you imagine what, say, just as an example, what Google Labs has

141
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
in terms of experiments with Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, blah, blah, blah --

142
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
all these things are going to become Web based.

143
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
They're going through the machine.

144
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web.

145
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Right now, it's not. If you do spreadsheets and things at work,

146
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
a Word document, they aren't on the Web,

147
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
but they are going to be. They're going to be part of this machine.

148
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
They're going to speak the Web language.

149
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
They're going to talk to the machine.

150
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The Web, in some sense, is kind of like a black hole

151
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that's sucking up everything into it.

152
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And so every thing will be part of the Web.

153
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So every item, every artifact that we make, will have embedded in it

154
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
some little sliver of Web-ness and connection,

155
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and it will be part of this machine,

156
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
so that our environment -- kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense --

157
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
our environment becomes the Web. Everything is connected.

158
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Now, with RFIDs and other things -- whatever technology it is,

159
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
it doesn't really matter. The point is that everything

160
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine,

161
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and so we have, basically, an Internet of things.

162
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels,

163
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and a car as a chip with wheels,

164
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
because basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars

165
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
is the embedded intelligence and electronics in it, and not the materials.

166
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
A lot of people think about the new economy

167
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
as something that was going to be a disembodied,

168
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
alternative, virtual existence,

169
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and that we would have the old economy of atoms.

170
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
But in fact, what the new economy really is

171
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
is the marriage of those two, where we embed the information,

172
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and the digital nature of things into the material world.

173
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
That's what we're looking forward to. That is where we're going --

174
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
this union, this convergence of the atomic and the digital.

175
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And so one of the consequences of that, I believe,

176
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now --

177
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
TV, film, video -- that basically becomes one media platform.

178
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And while there's many differences in some senses,

179
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
they will share more and more in common with each other.

180
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So that the laws of media, such as the fact that copies have no value,

181
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
the value's in the uncopiable things,

182
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the immediacy, the authentication, the personalization.

183
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
The media wants to be liquid.

184
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
The reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them,

185
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
not so that they are "free" as in "beer," but "free" as in "freedom."

186
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And the network effects rule,

187
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
meaning that the more you have, the more you get.

188
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
The first fax machine -- the person who bought the first fax machine

189
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
was an idiot, because there was nobody to fax to.

190
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But here she became an evangelist, recruiting others

191
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
to get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable.

192
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Those are the effects that we're going to see.

193
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Attention is the currency.

194
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media.

195
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And the other thing about this embodiment

196
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
is that there's kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal.

197
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
McLuhan was saying, "Machines are the extensions of the human senses."

198
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And I'm saying, "Humans are now going to be

199
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
the extended senses of the machine," in a certain sense.

200
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So we have a trillion eyes, and ears, and touches,

201
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
through all our digital photographs and cameras.

202
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And we see that in things like Flickr,

203
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
or Photosynth, this program from Microsoft

204
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
that will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place

205
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
from the thousands of tourist snapshots of it.

206
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
In a certain sense, the machine is seeing through the pixels of individual cameras.

207
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Now, the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring,

208
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that what the Web is doing is restructuring.

209
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And I have to warn you, that what we'll talk about is --

210
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I'm going to give my explanation of a term you're hearing, which is a "semantic Web."

211
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
So first of all, the first stage that we've seen

212
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
of the Internet was that it was going to link computers.

213
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And that's what we called the Net; that was the Internet of nets.

214
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And we saw that, where you have all the computers of the world.

215
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And if you remember, it was a kind of green screen with cursors,

216
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and there was really not much to do, and if you wanted to connect it,

217
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
you connected it from one computer to another computer.

218
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And what you had to do was -- if you wanted to participate in this,

219
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
you had to share packets of information.

220
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So you were forwarding on. You didn't have control.

221
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
It wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line:

222
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
you had to share packets.

223
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
The second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages.

224
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
So in the old one, if I wanted to go on to an airline Web page,

225
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I went from my computer, to an FTP site, to another airline computer.

226
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Now we have pages -- the unit has been resolved into pages,

227
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
so one page links to another page.

228
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And if I want to go in to book a flight,

229
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I go into the airline's flight page, the website of the airline,

230
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and I'm linking to that page.

231
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And what we're sharing were links, so you had to be kind of open with links.

232
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
You couldn't deny -- if someone wanted to link to you,

233
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
you couldn't stop them. You had to participate in this idea

234
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody.

235
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
So that's what we were doing.

236
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
We're now entering to the third stage, which is what I'm talking about,

237
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and that is where we link the data.

238
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So, I don't know what the name of this thing is.

239
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I'm calling it the one machine. But we're linking data.

240
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So we're going from machine to machine,

241
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
from page to page, and now data to data.

242
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
So the difference is, is that rather than linking from page to page,

243
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
we're actually going to link from one idea on a page

244
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
to another idea, rather than to the other page.

245
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So every idea is basically being supported --

246
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
or every item, or every noun -- is being supported by the entire Web.

247
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
It's being resolved at the level of items, or ideas, or words, if you want.

248
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So besides physically coming out again into this idea

249
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
that it's not just virtual, it's actually going out to things.

250
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So something will resolve down to the information

251
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
about a particular person, so every person will have a unique ID.

252
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Every person, every item will have a something

253
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that will be very specific, and will link

254
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
to a specific representation of that idea or item.

255
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
So now, in this new one, when I link to it,

256
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
I would link to my particular flight, my particular seat.

257
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And so, giving an example of this thing,

258
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
I live in Pacifica, rather than -- right now Pacifica

259
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere.

260
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
The Web doesn't know that that is actually a town,

261
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and that it's a specific town that I live in,

262
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
but that's what we're going to be talking about.

263
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
It's going to link directly to --

264
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
it will know, the Web will be able to read itself

265
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and know that that actually is a place,

266
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and that whenever it sees that word, "Pacifica,"

267
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
it knows that it actually has a place,

268
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
latitude, longitude, a certain population.

269
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
So here are some of the technical terms, all three-letter things,

270
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
that you'll see a lot more of.

271
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
All these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data.

272
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
So I'll give you one kind of an example.

273
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
There's like a billion social sites on the Web.

274
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Each time you go into there, you have to tell it again who you are

275
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and all your friends are.

276
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Why should you be doing that? You should just do that once,

277
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and it should know who all your friends are.

278
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
So that's what you want, is all your friends are identified,

279
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and you should just carry these relationships around.

280
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
All this data about you should just be conveyed,

281
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and you should do it once and that's all that should happen.

282
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And you should have all the networks

283
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
of all the relationships between those pieces of data.

284
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
That's what we're moving into -- where it sort of knows these things down to that level.

285
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
A semantic Web, Web 3.0, giant global graph --

286
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
we're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing.

287
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
But what's it's doing is sharing data.

288
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
So you have to be open to having your data shared, which is a much bigger step

289
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
than just sharing your Web page, or your computer.

290
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And all these things that are going to be on this

291
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
are not just pages, they are things.

292
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Everything we've described, every artifact or place,

293
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
will be a specific representation,

294
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
will have a specific character that can be linked to directly.

295
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
So we have this database of things.

296
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And so there's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to,

297
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
that we won't see in the next 10 years, or 5,000 days,

298
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
but I think that's where we're going to. And as the Internet of things --

299
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
where I'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane --

300
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
that that physical thing becomes part of the Web.

301
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And so we are in the middle of this thing

302
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
that's completely linked, down to every object

303
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
in the little sliver of a connection that it has.

304
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
So, the last thing I want to talk about is this idea

305
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
that we're going to be codependent.

306
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
It's always going to be there, and the closer it is, the better.

307
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
If you allow Google to, it will tell you your search history.

308
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And I found out by looking at it

309
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
that I search most at 11 o'clock in the morning.

310
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
So I am open, and being transparent to that.

311
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
And I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency.

312
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
That is going to be the price.

313
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
If you want to have total personalization,

314
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
you have to be totally transparent.

315
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Google. I can't remember my phone number, I'll just ask Google.

316
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
We're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point

317
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
where I don't even try to remember things --

318
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
I'll just Google it. It's easier to do that.

319
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
And we kind of object at first, saying, "Oh, that's awful."

320
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
But if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology,

321
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
called the alphabet, and writing,

322
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
we're totally dependent on it, and it's transformed culture.

323
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
We cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing.

324
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
And so in the same way, we're going to not imagine ourselves

325
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
without this other machine being there.

326
0:16:59.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
And what is happening with this is

327
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
some kind of AI, but it's not the AI in conscious AI,

328
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
as being an expert, Larry Page told me

329
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
that that's what they're trying to do,

330
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and that's what they're trying to do.

331
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
But when six billion humans are Googling,

332
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
who's searching who? It goes both ways.

333
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
So we are the Web, that's what this thing is.

334
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
We are going to be the machine.

335
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
So the next 5,000 days, it's not going to be the Web and only better.

336
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Just like it wasn't TV and only better.

337
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
The next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web

338
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:33,000
but only better -- it's going to be something different.

339
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
And I think it's going to be smarter.

340
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
It'll have an intelligence in there, that's not, again, conscious.

341
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
But it'll anticipate what we're doing, in a good sense.

342
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Secondly, it's become much more personalized.

343
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
It will know us, and that's good.

344
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
And again, the price of that will be transparency.

345
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:17:56,000
And thirdly, it's going to become more ubiquitous

346
0:17:56.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
in terms of filling your entire environment, and we will be in the middle of it.

347
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:04,000
And all these devices will be portals into that.

348
0:18:04.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
So the single idea that I wanted to leave with you

349
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
is that we have to begin to think about this as not just "the Web, only better,"

350
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:16,000
but a new kind of stage in this development.

351
0:18:16.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
It looks more global. If you take this whole thing,

352
0:18:19.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
it is a very big machine, very reliable machine,

353
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
more reliable than its parts.

354
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
But we can also think about it as kind of a large organism.

355
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:32,000
So we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system,

356
0:18:32.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
more as if this wasn't a large organism

357
0:18:34.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
that we are going to be interacting with. It's a "One."

358
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
And I don't know what else to call it, than the One.

359
0:18:41.16,000 --> 0:18:42,000
We'll have a better word for it.

360
0:18:42.16,000 --> 0:18:45,000
But there's a unity of some sort that's starting to emerge.

361
0:18:45.16,000 --> 0:18:48,000
And again, I don't want to talk about consciousness,

362
0:18:48.16,000 --> 0:18:5,000
I want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria,

363
0:18:50.16,000 --> 0:18:53,000
or a volvox, which is what that organism is.

364
0:18:53.16,000 --> 0:18:59,000
So, to do, action, take-away. So, here's what I would say:

365
0:18:59.16,000 --> 0:19:03,000
there's only one machine, and the Web is its OS.

366
0:19:03.16,000 --> 0:19:07,000
All screens look into the One. No bits will live outside the Web.

367
0:19:07.16,000 --> 0:19:11,000
To share is to gain. Let the One read it.

368
0:19:11.16,000 --> 0:19:12,000
It's going to be machine-readable.

369
0:19:12.16,000 --> 0:19:15,000
You want to make something that the machine can read.

370
0:19:15.16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
And the One is us. We are in the One.

371
0:19:20.16,000 --> 0:19:22,000
I appreciate your time.

372
0:19:22.16,000 --> 0:19:25,000
(Applause)

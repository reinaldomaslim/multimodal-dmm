1
0:00:13.145,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I am a writer.

2
0:00:14.712,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Writing books is my profession but it's more than that, of course.

3
0:00:18.472,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It is also my great lifelong love and fascination.

4
0:00:22.396,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And I don't expect that that's ever going to change.

5
0:00:25.311,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But, that said, something kind of peculiar has happened recently

6
0:00:30.346,000 --> 0:00:32,000
in my life and in my career,

7
0:00:32.595,000 --> 0:00:36,000
which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work.

8
0:00:37.362,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book,

9
0:00:40.996,000 --> 0:00:41,000
this memoir called "Eat, Pray, Love"

10
0:00:42.964,000 --> 0:00:46,000
which, decidedly unlike any of my previous books,

11
0:00:47.529,000 --> 0:00:5,000
went out in the world for some reason, and became this big,

12
0:00:50.597,000 --> 0:00:53,000
mega-sensation, international bestseller thing.

13
0:00:53.963,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The result of which is that everywhere I go now,

14
0:00:57.029,000 --> 0:00:59,000
people treat me like I'm doomed.

15
0:00:59.629,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Seriously -- doomed, doomed!

16
0:01:02.511,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Like, they come up to me now, all worried, and they say,

17
0:01:05.202,000 --> 0:01:09,000
"Aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that?

18
0:01:09.4,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life

19
0:01:12.646,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and you're never again going to create a book

20
0:01:14.813,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that anybody in the world cares about at all,

21
0:01:17.379,000 --> 0:01:19,000
ever again?"

22
0:01:19.879,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So that's reassuring, you know.

23
0:01:22.228,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But it would be worse, except for that I happen to remember

24
0:01:25.039,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that over 20 years ago, when I was a teenager,

25
0:01:28.298,000 --> 0:01:31,000
when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writer,

26
0:01:31.445,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I was met with this same sort of fear-based reaction.

27
0:01:34.016,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And people would say, "Aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success?

28
0:01:37.85,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you?

29
0:01:40.797,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft

30
0:01:44.281,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and nothing's ever going to come of it

31
0:01:46.161,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and you're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams

32
0:01:48.82,000 --> 0:01:5,000
with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure?"

33
0:01:51.311,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:52.664,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Like that, you know.

35
0:01:54.516,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is, "Yes."

36
0:01:59.677,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Yes, I'm afraid of all those things.

37
0:02:01.977,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And I always have been.

38
0:02:03.242,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And I'm afraid of many, many more things besides

39
0:02:05.552,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that people can't even guess at,

40
0:02:07.477,000 --> 0:02:1,000
like seaweed and other things that are scary.

41
0:02:11.458,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But, when it comes to writing,

42
0:02:13.709,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately, and wondering about lately,

43
0:02:17.693,000 --> 0:02:18,000
is why?

44
0:02:18.867,000 --> 0:02:19,000
You know, is it rational?

45
0:02:20.161,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Is it logical that anybody should be expected

46
0:02:22.408,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do.

47
0:02:27.06,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And what is it specifically about creative ventures

48
0:02:31.46,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health

49
0:02:34.932,000 --> 0:02:37,000
in a way that other careers kind of don't do, you know?

50
0:02:37.959,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Like my dad, for example, was a chemical engineer

51
0:02:41.982,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and I don't recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering

52
0:02:45.359,000 --> 0:02:48,000
anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer, you know?

53
0:02:49.041,000 --> 0:02:54,000
"That chemical-engineering block, John, how's it going?"

54
0:02:54.852,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It just didn't come up like that, you know?

55
0:02:57.016,000 --> 0:03:,000
But to be fair, chemical engineers as a group

56
0:03:00.85,000 --> 0:03:02,000
haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries

57
0:03:03.398,000 --> 0:03:05,000
for being alcoholic manic-depressives.

58
0:03:06.094,000 --> 0:03:07,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:07.542,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We writers, we kind of do have that reputation,

60
0:03:10.376,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and not just writers, but creative people across all genres,

61
0:03:14.359,000 --> 0:03:18,000
it seems, have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable.

62
0:03:19.06,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count

63
0:03:22.876,000 --> 0:03:25,000
in the 20th century alone, of really magnificent creative minds

64
0:03:26.459,000 --> 0:03:29,000
who died young and often at their own hands, you know?

65
0:03:29.585,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide

66
0:03:32.851,000 --> 0:03:35,000
seem to be really undone by their gifts, you know.

67
0:03:36.227,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Norman Mailer, just before he died, last interview, he said,

68
0:03:39.126,000 --> 0:03:43,000
"Every one of my books has killed me a little more."

69
0:03:43.227,000 --> 0:03:46,000
An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work.

70
0:03:46.826,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this,

71
0:03:49.786,000 --> 0:03:51,000
because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long

72
0:03:52.392,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively

73
0:03:56.393,000 --> 0:04:,000
this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked

74
0:04:01.06,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and that artistry, in the end, will always ultimately lead to anguish.

75
0:04:06.126,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And the question that I want to ask everybody here today

76
0:04:08.817,000 --> 0:04:1,000
is are you guys all cool with that idea?

77
0:04:11.334,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Are you comfortable with that?

78
0:04:13.541,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Because you look at it even from an inch away and, you know --

79
0:04:16.565,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption.

80
0:04:19.692,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I think it's odious.

81
0:04:21.178,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And I also think it's dangerous,

82
0:04:23.131,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century.

83
0:04:26.06,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live.

84
0:04:29.934,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And I definitely know that, in my case -- in my situation --

85
0:04:35.709,000 --> 0:04:4,000
it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path

86
0:04:40.872,000 --> 0:04:41,000
of assumption,

87
0:04:42.093,000 --> 0:04:46,000
particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career.

88
0:04:46.246,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Which is -- you know, like check it out,

89
0:04:48.785,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I'm pretty young, I'm only about 40 years old.

90
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me.

91
0:04:54.294,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward

92
0:04:58.811,000 --> 0:05:,000
is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after

93
0:05:01.788,000 --> 0:05:04,000
the freakish success of my last book, right?

94
0:05:05.111,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I should just put it bluntly, because we're all sort of friends here now --

95
0:05:09.073,000 --> 0:05:13,000
it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me.

96
0:05:13.354,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So Jesus, what a thought!

97
0:05:15.554,000 --> 0:05:17,000
That's the kind of thought that could lead a person

98
0:05:17.984,000 --> 0:05:19,000
to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning,

99
0:05:20.612,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and I don't want to go there.

100
0:05:23.549,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Laughter)

101
0:05:24.607,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love.

102
0:05:27.061,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And so, the question becomes, how?

103
0:05:30.399,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And so, it seems to me, upon a lot of reflection,

104
0:05:33.283,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that the way that I have to work now, in order to continue writing,

105
0:05:36.648,000 --> 0:05:39,000
is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct, right?

106
0:05:40.482,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance

107
0:05:43.982,000 --> 0:05:47,000
between me, as I am writing, and my very natural anxiety

108
0:05:48.867,000 --> 0:05:51,000
about what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on.

109
0:05:52.732,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And, as I've been looking, over the last year,

110
0:05:55.143,000 --> 0:05:56,000
for models for how to do that,

111
0:05:57,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I've been sort of looking across time,

112
0:05:59.148,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and I've been trying to find other societies

113
0:06:01.25,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have

114
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:07,000
about how to help creative people

115
0:06:07.227,000 --> 0:06:1,000
sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity.

116
0:06:11.033,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.

117
0:06:16.048,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So stay with me, because it does circle around and back.

118
0:06:18.739,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But, ancient Greece and ancient Rome --

119
0:06:20.895,000 --> 0:06:22,000
people did not happen to believe that creativity

120
0:06:23.461,000 --> 0:06:25,000
came from human beings back then, OK?

121
0:06:25.879,000 --> 0:06:29,000
People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit

122
0:06:30.338,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source,

123
0:06:34.339,000 --> 0:06:36,000
for distant and unknowable reasons.

124
0:06:36.788,000 --> 0:06:41,000
The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity "daemons."

125
0:06:42.039,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Socrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon

126
0:06:45.139,000 --> 0:06:47,000
who spoke wisdom to him from afar.

127
0:06:47.596,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The Romans had the same idea,

128
0:06:49.213,000 --> 0:06:53,000
but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius.

129
0:06:53.823,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Which is great, because the Romans did not actually think

130
0:06:56.562,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that a genius was a particularly clever individual.

131
0:06:59.356,000 --> 0:07:02,000
They believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity,

132
0:07:03.039,000 --> 0:07:08,000
who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio,

133
0:07:08.361,000 --> 0:07:1,000
kind of like Dobby the house elf,

134
0:07:10.905,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and who would come out

135
0:07:12.443,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work

136
0:07:15.069,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and would shape the outcome of that work.

137
0:07:17.538,000 --> 0:07:2,000
So brilliant -- there it is, right there, that distance that I'm talking about --

138
0:07:21.42,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work.

139
0:07:25.622,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And everyone knew that this is how it functioned, right?

140
0:07:29.23,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So the ancient artist was protected from certain things,

141
0:07:31.921,000 --> 0:07:33,000
like, for example, too much narcissism, right?

142
0:07:34.322,000 --> 0:07:37,000
If your work was brilliant, you couldn't take all the credit for it,

143
0:07:37.537,000 --> 0:07:4,000
everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you.

144
0:07:41.256,000 --> 0:07:44,000
If your work bombed, not entirely your fault, you know?

145
0:07:44.625,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame.

146
0:07:47.143,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Laughter)

147
0:07:48.201,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And this is how people thought about creativity in the West

148
0:07:51.723,000 --> 0:07:52,000
for a really long time.

149
0:07:53.055,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And then the Renaissance came and everything changed,

150
0:07:55.655,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and we had this big idea, and the big idea was,

151
0:07:57.97,000 --> 0:08:,000
let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe

152
0:08:01.189,000 --> 0:08:02,000
above all gods and mysteries,

153
0:08:02.754,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and there's no more room for mystical creatures

154
0:08:05.063,000 --> 0:08:06,000
who take dictation from the divine.

155
0:08:06.855,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And it's the beginning of rational humanism,

156
0:08:08.99,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and people started to believe that creativity

157
0:08:11.157,000 --> 0:08:13,000
came completely from the self of the individual.

158
0:08:13.521,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And for the first time in history,

159
0:08:15.371,000 --> 0:08:2,000
you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius,

160
0:08:20.482,000 --> 0:08:21,000
rather than having a genius.

161
0:08:22.323,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And I got to tell you, I think that was a huge error.

162
0:08:25.647,000 --> 0:08:29,000
You know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person

163
0:08:29.893,000 --> 0:08:31,000
to believe that he or she is like, the vessel,

164
0:08:32.656,000 --> 0:08:34,000
you know, like the font and the essence and the source

165
0:08:35.252,000 --> 0:08:38,000
of all divine, creative, unknowable, eternal mystery

166
0:08:38.605,000 --> 0:08:44,000
is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile, human psyche.

167
0:08:44.69,000 --> 0:08:47,000
It's like asking somebody to swallow the sun.

168
0:08:48.205,000 --> 0:08:5,000
It just completely warps and distorts egos,

169
0:08:50.856,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance.

170
0:08:54.406,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And I think the pressure of that

171
0:08:56.405,000 --> 0:08:59,000
has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years.

172
0:08:59.622,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And, if this is true,

173
0:09:02.287,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and I think it is true,

174
0:09:03.873,000 --> 0:09:05,000
the question becomes, what now?

175
0:09:06.738,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Can we do this differently?

176
0:09:08.607,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding

177
0:09:12.003,000 --> 0:09:16,000
about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery.

178
0:09:16.504,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Maybe not.

179
0:09:17.857,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought

180
0:09:21.739,000 --> 0:09:23,000
in one 18 minute speech.

181
0:09:23.897,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And there's probably people in this audience

182
0:09:26.606,000 --> 0:09:3,000
who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions

183
0:09:30.721,000 --> 0:09:32,000
about the notion of, basically, fairies

184
0:09:33.1,000 --> 0:09:37,000
who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff.

185
0:09:38.088,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I'm not, probably, going to bring you all along with me on this.

186
0:09:42.405,000 --> 0:09:44,000
But the question that I kind of want to pose is --

187
0:09:45.19,000 --> 0:09:47,000
you know, why not?

188
0:09:47.387,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Why not think about it this way?

189
0:09:49.309,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard

190
0:09:53.421,000 --> 0:09:56,000
in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness

191
0:09:57.377,000 --> 0:09:58,000
of the creative process.

192
0:09:58.922,000 --> 0:10:01,000
A process which, as anybody who has ever tried to make something --

193
0:10:02.137,000 --> 0:10:04,000
which is to say basically everyone here ---

194
0:10:04.227,000 --> 0:10:07,000
knows does not always behave rationally.

195
0:10:07.338,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And, in fact, can sometimes feel downright paranormal.

196
0:10:11.921,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I had this encounter recently

197
0:10:13.697,000 --> 0:10:16,000
where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone,

198
0:10:17.406,000 --> 0:10:19,000
who's now in her 90s, but she's been a poet her entire life

199
0:10:20.241,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia,

200
0:10:23.471,000 --> 0:10:24,000
she would be out working in the fields,

201
0:10:25.353,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and she said she would feel and hear a poem

202
0:10:28.229,000 --> 0:10:29,000
coming at her from over the landscape.

203
0:10:30.236,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And she said it was like a thunderous train of air.

204
0:10:33.393,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape.

205
0:10:36.221,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And she felt it coming, because it would shake the earth under her feet.

206
0:10:39.723,000 --> 0:10:41,000
She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point,

207
0:10:42.522,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and that was to, in her words, "run like hell."

208
0:10:44.773,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And she would run like hell to the house

209
0:10:46.805,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and she would be getting chased by this poem,

210
0:10:48.991,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil

211
0:10:52.621,000 --> 0:10:55,000
fast enough so that when it thundered through her, she could collect it

212
0:10:56.026,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and grab it on the page.

213
0:10:57.232,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And other times she wouldn't be fast enough,

214
0:10:59.345,000 --> 0:11:02,000
so she'd be running and running, and she wouldn't get to the house

215
0:11:02.572,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it

216
0:11:05.41,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and she said it would continue on across the landscape,

217
0:11:08.054,000 --> 0:11:1,000
looking, as she put it "for another poet."

218
0:11:10.162,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And then there were these times --

219
0:11:11.832,000 --> 0:11:12,000
this is the piece I never forgot --

220
0:11:13.711,000 --> 0:11:16,000
she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it, right?

221
0:11:17.193,000 --> 0:11:2,000
So, she's running to the house and she's looking for the paper

222
0:11:20.244,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and the poem passes through her,

223
0:11:21.861,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her,

224
0:11:24.495,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and then she said, it was like she would reach out with her other hand

225
0:11:27.863,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and she would catch it.

226
0:11:29.17,000 --> 0:11:3,000
She would catch the poem by its tail,

227
0:11:31.151,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and she would pull it backwards into her body

228
0:11:33.729,000 --> 0:11:34,000
as she was transcribing on the page.

229
0:11:35.589,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And in these instances, the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact

230
0:11:40.444,000 --> 0:11:43,000
but backwards, from the last word to the first.

231
0:11:43.849,000 --> 0:11:44,000
(Laughter)

232
0:11:45.561,000 --> 0:11:49,000
So when I heard that I was like -- that's uncanny,

233
0:11:50.278,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that's exactly what my creative process is like.

234
0:11:52.779,000 --> 0:11:55,000
(Laughter)

235
0:11:56.392,000 --> 0:11:59,000
That's not at all what my creative process is -- I'm not the pipeline!

236
0:11:59.758,000 --> 0:12:01,000
I'm a mule, and the way that I have to work

237
0:12:01.812,000 --> 0:12:03,000
is I have to get up at the same time every day,

238
0:12:04.079,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly.

239
0:12:06.913,000 --> 0:12:07,000
But even I, in my mulishness,

240
0:12:08.776,000 --> 0:12:11,000
even I have brushed up against that thing, at times.

241
0:12:12.644,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And I would imagine that a lot of you have too.

242
0:12:14.907,000 --> 0:12:17,000
You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source

243
0:12:18.212,000 --> 0:12:2,000
that I honestly cannot identify.

244
0:12:20.723,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And what is that thing?

245
0:12:22.319,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds,

246
0:12:26.357,000 --> 0:12:28,000
but, in fact, might actually keep us sane?

247
0:12:29.243,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And for me, the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that

248
0:12:33.022,000 --> 0:12:35,000
is the musician Tom Waits,

249
0:12:35.354,000 --> 0:12:39,000
who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment.

250
0:12:39.895,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And we were talking about this,

251
0:12:41.396,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and you know, Tom, for most of his life, he was pretty much the embodiment

252
0:12:44.957,000 --> 0:12:46,000
of the tormented contemporary modern artist,

253
0:12:47.077,000 --> 0:12:49,000
trying to control and manage and dominate

254
0:12:49.404,000 --> 0:12:51,000
these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses

255
0:12:51.878,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that were totally internalized.

256
0:12:53.765,000 --> 0:12:54,000
But then he got older, he got calmer,

257
0:12:55.77,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles,

258
0:12:58.693,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and this is when it all changed for him.

259
0:13:00.629,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And he's speeding along, and all of a sudden

260
0:13:02.719,000 --> 0:13:05,000
he hears this little fragment of melody,

261
0:13:06.265,000 --> 0:13:1,000
that comes into his head as inspiration often comes, elusive and tantalizing,

262
0:13:10.294,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and he wants it, it's gorgeous,

263
0:13:12.422,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and he longs for it, but he has no way to get it.

264
0:13:14.747,000 --> 0:13:17,000
He doesn't have a piece of paper, or a pencil, or a tape recorder.

265
0:13:17.922,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him

266
0:13:21.006,000 --> 0:13:22,000
like, "I'm going to lose this thing,

267
0:13:22.771,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and I'll be be haunted by this song forever.

268
0:13:24.891,000 --> 0:13:25,000
I'm not good enough, and I can't do it."

269
0:13:26.82,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And instead of panicking, he just stopped.

270
0:13:28.854,000 --> 0:13:32,000
He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel.

271
0:13:32.996,000 --> 0:13:34,000
He just looked up at the sky, and he said,

272
0:13:35.479,000 --> 0:13:37,000
"Excuse me, can you not see that I'm driving?"

273
0:13:38.493,000 --> 0:13:41,000
(Laughter)

274
0:13:42.194,000 --> 0:13:44,000
"Do I look like I can write down a song right now?

275
0:13:44.928,000 --> 0:13:47,000
If you really want to exist, come back at a more opportune moment

276
0:13:48.773,000 --> 0:13:49,000
when I can take care of you.

277
0:13:50.435,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Otherwise, go bother somebody else today.

278
0:13:53.512,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Go bother Leonard Cohen."

279
0:13:56.808,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And his whole work process changed after that.

280
0:13:59.94,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Not the work, the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever.

281
0:14:03.548,000 --> 0:14:06,000
But the process, and the heavy anxiety around it

282
0:14:06.607,000 --> 0:14:08,000
was released when he took the genie, the genius out of him

283
0:14:09.554,000 --> 0:14:12,000
where it was causing nothing but trouble, and released it back where it came from,

284
0:14:13.465,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized, tormented thing.

285
0:14:17.126,000 --> 0:14:2,000
It could be this peculiar, wondrous, bizarre collaboration,

286
0:14:20.264,000 --> 0:14:24,000
kind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing

287
0:14:24.396,000 --> 0:14:25,000
that was not quite Tom.

288
0:14:26.629,000 --> 0:14:28,000
When I heard that story, it started to shift a little bit

289
0:14:29.336,000 --> 0:14:32,000
the way that I worked too, and this idea already saved me once.

290
0:14:32.365,000 --> 0:14:35,000
It saved me when I was in the middle of writing "Eat, Pray, Love,"

291
0:14:35.493,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair

292
0:14:38.026,000 --> 0:14:41,000
that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming

293
0:14:41.506,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and you start to think this is going to be a disaster, the worst book ever written.

294
0:14:45.69,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Not just bad, but the worst book ever written.

295
0:14:48.064,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And I started to think I should just dump this project.

296
0:14:51.479,000 --> 0:14:54,000
But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air

297
0:14:54.554,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and I tried it.

298
0:14:56.602,000 --> 0:14:58,000
So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript

299
0:14:59.094,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room.

300
0:15:02.024,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And I said aloud, "Listen you, thing,

301
0:15:05.602,000 --> 0:15:08,000
you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant

302
0:15:08.8,000 --> 0:15:09,000
that is not entirely my fault, right?

303
0:15:10.601,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this,

304
0:15:13.857,000 --> 0:15:14,000
I don't have any more than this.

305
0:15:15.496,000 --> 0:15:18,000
If you want it to be better, you've got to show up and do your part of the deal.

306
0:15:19.305,000 --> 0:15:21,000
But if you don't do that, you know what, the hell with it.

307
0:15:22.146,000 --> 0:15:24,000
I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job.

308
0:15:24.852,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And I would please like the record to reflect today

309
0:15:27.312,000 --> 0:15:28,000
that I showed up for my part of the job."

310
0:15:29.334,000 --> 0:15:31,000
(Laughter)

311
0:15:32.349,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Because --

312
0:15:34.436,000 --> 0:15:36,000
(Applause)

313
0:15:36.51,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Because in the end it's like this, OK --

314
0:15:38.682,000 --> 0:15:4,000
centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa,

315
0:15:41.083,000 --> 0:15:45,000
people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music

316
0:15:45.75,000 --> 0:15:47,000
that would go on for hours and hours, until dawn.

317
0:15:48.454,000 --> 0:15:51,000
They were always magnificent, because the dancers were professionals

318
0:15:51.698,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and they were terrific, right?

319
0:15:53.152,000 --> 0:15:56,000
But every once in a while, very rarely, something would happen,

320
0:15:56.473,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and one of these performers would actually become transcendent.

321
0:15:59.985,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And I know you know what I'm talking about,

322
0:16:02.269,000 --> 0:16:04,000
because I know you've all seen, at some point in your life,

323
0:16:05.089,000 --> 0:16:06,000
a performance like this.

324
0:16:06.389,000 --> 0:16:07,000
It was like time would stop,

325
0:16:08.318,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal

326
0:16:11.247,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and he wasn't doing anything different

327
0:16:13.151,000 --> 0:16:15,000
than he had ever done, 1,000 nights before,

328
0:16:15.184,000 --> 0:16:16,000
but everything would align.

329
0:16:16.935,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And all of a sudden, he would no longer appear to be merely human.

330
0:16:20.102,000 --> 0:16:22,000
He would be lit from within, and lit from below

331
0:16:22.501,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and all lit up on fire with divinity.

332
0:16:26.291,000 --> 0:16:28,000
And when this happened, back then,

333
0:16:28.436,000 --> 0:16:32,000
people knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its name.

334
0:16:32.652,000 --> 0:16:35,000
They would put their hands together and they would start to chant,

335
0:16:35.819,000 --> 0:16:38,000
"Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God."

336
0:16:39.384,000 --> 0:16:42,000
That's God, you know.

337
0:16:42.486,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Curious historical footnote:

338
0:16:45.166,000 --> 0:16:49,000
when the Moors invaded southern Spain, they took this custom with them

339
0:16:50.007,000 --> 0:16:52,000
and the pronunciation changed over the centuries

340
0:16:52.317,000 --> 0:16:54,000
from "Allah, Allah, Allah," to "Olé, olé, olé,"

341
0:16:55.117,000 --> 0:16:58,000
which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances.

342
0:16:58.291,000 --> 0:17:01,000
In Spain, when a performer has done something impossible and magic,

343
0:17:01.944,000 --> 0:17:04,000
"Allah, olé, olé, Allah, magnificent, bravo,"

344
0:17:05.093,000 --> 0:17:07,000
incomprehensible, there it is -- a glimpse of God.

345
0:17:08.547,000 --> 0:17:1,000
Which is great, because we need that.

346
0:17:10.669,000 --> 0:17:13,000
But, the tricky bit comes the next morning,

347
0:17:14.52,000 --> 0:17:17,000
for the dancer himself, when he wakes up and discovers

348
0:17:17.947,000 --> 0:17:2,000
that it's Tuesday at 11 a.m., and he's no longer a glimpse of God.

349
0:17:21.394,000 --> 0:17:24,000
He's just an aging mortal with really bad knees,

350
0:17:24.886,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again.

351
0:17:29.126,000 --> 0:17:32,000
And maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins,

352
0:17:32.853,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and what is he then to do with the rest of his life?

353
0:17:35.711,000 --> 0:17:36,000
This is hard.

354
0:17:37.093,000 --> 0:17:39,000
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make

355
0:17:39.935,000 --> 0:17:41,000
in a creative life.

356
0:17:42.026,000 --> 0:17:45,000
But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish

357
0:17:45.209,000 --> 0:17:48,000
if you never happened to believe, in the first place,

358
0:17:48.476,000 --> 0:17:52,000
that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you.

359
0:17:52.581,000 --> 0:17:54,000
But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you

360
0:17:55.442,000 --> 0:17:58,000
from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life

361
0:17:59.05,000 --> 0:18:01,000
to be passed along when you're finished,

362
0:18:01.09,000 --> 0:18:02,000
with somebody else.

363
0:18:02.941,000 --> 0:18:06,000
And, you know, if we think about it this way, it starts to change everything.

364
0:18:07.746,000 --> 0:18:08,000
This is how I've started to think,

365
0:18:09.61,000 --> 0:18:12,000
and this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months

366
0:18:12.959,000 --> 0:18:14,000
as I've been working on the book that will soon be published,

367
0:18:15.888,000 --> 0:18:18,000
as the dangerously, frighteningly over-anticipated follow up

368
0:18:19.443,000 --> 0:18:21,000
to my freakish success.

369
0:18:22.103,000 --> 0:18:24,000
And what I have to sort of keep telling myself

370
0:18:25.026,000 --> 0:18:29,000
when I get really psyched out about that is don't be afraid.

371
0:18:29.226,000 --> 0:18:32,000
Don't be daunted. Just do your job.

372
0:18:32.575,000 --> 0:18:35,000
Continue to show up for your piece of it, whatever that might be.

373
0:18:35.695,000 --> 0:18:37,000
If your job is to dance, do your dance.

374
0:18:38.46,000 --> 0:18:41,000
If the divine, cockeyed genius assigned to your case

375
0:18:42.425,000 --> 0:18:47,000
decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed, for just one moment

376
0:18:47.509,000 --> 0:18:49,000
through your efforts, then "Olé!"

377
0:18:50.213,000 --> 0:18:52,000
And if not, do your dance anyhow.

378
0:18:53.148,000 --> 0:18:54,000
And "Olé!" to you, nonetheless.

379
0:18:54.829,000 --> 0:18:56,000
I believe this and I feel that we must teach it.

380
0:18:57.139,000 --> 0:18:58,000
"Olé!" to you, nonetheless,

381
0:18:58.617,000 --> 0:19:01,000
just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness

382
0:19:01.93,000 --> 0:19:02,000
to keep showing up.

383
0:19:03.775,000 --> 0:19:04,000
Thank you.

384
0:19:05.45,000 --> 0:19:07,000
(Applause)

385
0:19:07.525,000 --> 0:19:08,000
Thank you.

386
0:19:09.016,000 --> 0:19:12,000
(Applause)

387
0:19:12.13,000 --> 0:19:13,000
June Cohen: Olé!

388
0:19:13.963,000 --> 0:19:16,000
(Applause)

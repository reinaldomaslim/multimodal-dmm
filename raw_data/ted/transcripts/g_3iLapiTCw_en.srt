2
0:00:12.502,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Frugal Digital is essentially a small research group at C.I.D.

3
0:00:17.787,000 --> 0:00:19,000
where we are looking to find

4
0:00:19.93,000 --> 0:00:23,000
alternate visions of how to create a digitally inclusive society.

5
0:00:24.47,000 --> 0:00:25,000
That's what we're after.

6
0:00:26.278,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And we do this because we actually believe

7
0:00:28.458,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that silicon technology today is mostly about

8
0:00:31.732,000 --> 0:00:32,000
a culture of excess.

9
0:00:33.484,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It's about the fastest and the most efficient

10
0:00:35.657,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and the most dazzling gadget you can have,

11
0:00:38.087,000 --> 0:00:4,000
while about two-thirds of the world

12
0:00:40.985,000 --> 0:00:43,000
can hardly reach the most basic of this technology

13
0:00:44.669,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to even address fundamental needs in life,

14
0:00:48.252,000 --> 0:00:5,000
including health care, education

15
0:00:50.42,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and all these kinds of very fundamental issues.

16
0:00:54.499,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So before I start, I want to talk about a little anecdote,

17
0:00:57.744,000 --> 0:01:01,000
a little story about a man I met once in Mumbai.

18
0:01:01.767,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So this man, his name is Sathi Shri.

19
0:01:03.954,000 --> 0:01:05,000
He is an outstanding person,

20
0:01:06.06,000 --> 0:01:08,000
because he's a small entrepreneur.

21
0:01:08.202,000 --> 0:01:09,000
He runs a little shop

22
0:01:09.944,000 --> 0:01:11,000
in one of the back streets of Mumbai.

23
0:01:11.947,000 --> 0:01:14,000
He has this little 10-square-meter store,

24
0:01:14.995,000 --> 0:01:16,000
where so much is being done.

25
0:01:17.145,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It's incredible, because I couldn't believe my eyes

26
0:01:19.05,000 --> 0:01:21,000
when I once just happened to bump into him.

27
0:01:21.533,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Basically, what he does is, he has all these services

28
0:01:23.658,000 --> 0:01:25,000
for micro-payments and booking tickets

29
0:01:26.411,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and all kinds of basic things that you would go online for,

30
0:01:29.744,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but he does it for people offline

31
0:01:31.933,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and connects to the digital world.

32
0:01:33.93,000 --> 0:01:34,000
More importantly, he makes his money

33
0:01:35.435,000 --> 0:01:37,000
by selling these mobile recharge coupons, you know,

34
0:01:38.028,000 --> 0:01:4,000
for the prepaid subscriptions.

35
0:01:40.303,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But then, in the backside, he's got this little nook

36
0:01:43.544,000 --> 0:01:45,000
with a few of his employees

37
0:01:46.117,000 --> 0:01:48,000
where they can fix almost anything.

38
0:01:48.701,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Any cell phone, any gadget you can bring them, they can fix it.

39
0:01:51.959,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And it's pretty incredible because I took my iPhone there,

40
0:01:55.077,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and he was like, "Yeah, do you want an upgrade?"

41
0:01:57.246,000 --> 0:01:59,000
"Yes." (Laughter)

42
0:01:59.564,000 --> 0:02:,000
I was a bit skeptical, but then, I decided

43
0:02:01.504,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to give him a Nokia instead. (Laughter)

44
0:02:06.137,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But what I was amazed about is this reverse engineering

45
0:02:11.352,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and know-how that's built into this little two meters of space.

46
0:02:16.304,000 --> 0:02:18,000
They have figured out everything that's required

47
0:02:18.895,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to dismantle, take things apart,

48
0:02:20.921,000 --> 0:02:22,000
rewrite the circuitry, re-flash the firmware,

49
0:02:23.88,000 --> 0:02:24,000
do whatever you want to with the phone,

50
0:02:25.847,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and they can fix anything so quickly.

51
0:02:28.416,000 --> 0:02:3,000
You can hand over a phone this morning

52
0:02:30.416,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and you can go pick it up after lunch,

53
0:02:32.336,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and it was quite incredible.

54
0:02:34.256,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But then we were wondering whether this is

55
0:02:35.827,000 --> 0:02:37,000
a local phenomenon, or is truly global?

56
0:02:38.369,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And, over time, we started understanding

57
0:02:40.619,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and systematically researching

58
0:02:42.338,000 --> 0:02:44,000
what this tinkering ecosystem is about,

59
0:02:44.454,000 --> 0:02:45,000
because that is something that's happening

60
0:02:46.059,000 --> 0:02:48,000
not just in one street corner in Mumbai.

61
0:02:48.091,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It's actually happening in all parts of the country.

62
0:02:51.205,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It's even happening in Africa, like, for example,

63
0:02:53.466,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in Cape Town we did extensive research on this.

64
0:02:55.513,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Even here in Doha I found this little nook

65
0:02:58.708,000 --> 0:03:,000
where you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed,

66
0:03:01.595,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and it's a lot of tiny little parts. It's not easy.

67
0:03:04.796,000 --> 0:03:06,000
You've got to try it on your own to believe it.

68
0:03:06.909,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But what fuels this?

69
0:03:08.463,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It's this entire ecosystem of low-cost parts

70
0:03:11.971,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and supplies that are produced all over the world, literally,

71
0:03:15.277,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and then redistributed to basically service this industry,

72
0:03:19.043,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and you can even buy salvaged parts.

73
0:03:21.214,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Basically, you don't have to necessarily buy

74
0:03:23.37,000 --> 0:03:25,000
brand new things. You have condemned computers

75
0:03:25.833,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that are stripped apart,

76
0:03:27.14,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and you can buy salvaged components

77
0:03:28.71,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and things that you can reassemble in a new configuration.

78
0:03:32.531,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But what does this new, sort of, approach give us?

79
0:03:36.012,000 --> 0:03:37,000
That's the real question, because this is something

80
0:03:37.932,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that's been there, part of every society

81
0:03:40.157,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that's deprived of enough resources.

82
0:03:42.523,000 --> 0:03:43,000
But there's an interesting paradigm.

83
0:03:44.42,000 --> 0:03:45,000
There's the traditional crafts,

84
0:03:45.912,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and then there's the technology crafts.

85
0:03:47.915,000 --> 0:03:49,000
We call it the technology crafts because these are emerging.

86
0:03:50.123,000 --> 0:03:52,000
They're not something that's been established.

87
0:03:52.195,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It's not something that's institutionalized.

88
0:03:54.862,000 --> 0:03:55,000
It's not taught in universities.

89
0:03:56.633,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It's taught [by] word of mouth,

90
0:03:58.356,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and it's an informal education system around this.

91
0:04:00.265,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So we said, "What can we get out of this?

92
0:04:03.067,000 --> 0:04:05,000
You know, like, what are the key values that we can get out of this?"

93
0:04:05.801,000 --> 0:04:07,000
The main thing is a fix-it-locally culture,

94
0:04:08.146,000 --> 0:04:1,000
which is fantastic because it means that your product

95
0:04:10.486,000 --> 0:04:12,000
or your service doesn't have to go through

96
0:04:12.531,000 --> 0:04:14,000
a huge bureaucratic system to get it fixed.

97
0:04:15.139,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It also affords us cheap fabrication, which is fantastic,

98
0:04:18.218,000 --> 0:04:2,000
so it means that you can do a lot more with it.

99
0:04:20.25,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And then, the most important thing is,

100
0:04:22.564,000 --> 0:04:24,000
it gives us large math for low cost.

101
0:04:24.94,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So it means that you can actually embed

102
0:04:27.269,000 --> 0:04:3,000
pretty clever algorithms and lots of other kinds

103
0:04:30.794,000 --> 0:04:33,000
of extendable ideas into really simple devices.

104
0:04:34.452,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So, what we call this is a silicon cottage industry.

105
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It's basically what was the system or the paradigm

106
0:04:42.206,000 --> 0:04:44,000
before the industrial revolution is now re-happening

107
0:04:44.67,000 --> 0:04:47,000
in a whole new way in small digital shops

108
0:04:47.678,000 --> 0:04:5,000
across the planet in most developing countries.

109
0:04:50.759,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So, we kind of toyed around with this idea,

110
0:04:54.893,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and we said, "What can we do with this?

111
0:04:56.571,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Can we make a little product or a service out of it?"

112
0:04:59.099,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So one of the first things we did is this thing called

113
0:05:01.519,000 --> 0:05:03,000
a multimedia platform. We call it a lunch box.

114
0:05:03.915,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Basically one of the contexts that we studied was

115
0:05:06.666,000 --> 0:05:09,000
schools in very remote parts of India.

116
0:05:10.153,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So there is this amazing concept called the one-teacher school,

117
0:05:13.412,000 --> 0:05:15,000
which is basically a single teacher who is a multitasker

118
0:05:16.114,000 --> 0:05:18,000
who teaches this amazing little social setting.

119
0:05:18.591,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It's an informal school,

120
0:05:20.128,000 --> 0:05:22,000
but it's really about holistic education.

121
0:05:22.287,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The only thing that they don't have

122
0:05:23.525,000 --> 0:05:25,000
is access to resources. They don't even have a textbook

123
0:05:25.919,000 --> 0:05:27,000
sometimes, and they don't even have a proper curriculum.

124
0:05:28.746,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So we said, "What can we do to empower this teacher

125
0:05:32.25,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to do more?" How to access the digital world?

126
0:05:35.062,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Instead of being the sole guardian of information,

127
0:05:37.624,000 --> 0:05:39,000
be a facilitator to all this information.

128
0:05:40.028,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So we said, "What are the steps required to empower the teacher?"

129
0:05:43.412,000 --> 0:05:45,000
How do you make this teacher into a digital gateway,

130
0:05:46.067,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform

131
0:05:48.599,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that can be constructed locally and serviced locally?"

132
0:05:51.591,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So we walked around.

133
0:05:53.934,000 --> 0:05:55,000
We went and scavenged the nearby markets,

134
0:05:56.224,000 --> 0:06:,000
and we tried to understand, "What can we pick up that will make this happen?"

135
0:06:00.245,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So the thing that we got

136
0:06:02.772,000 --> 0:06:05,000
was a little mobile phone with a little pico projector

137
0:06:05.979,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that comes for about 60 dollars.

138
0:06:08.316,000 --> 0:06:1,000
We went a bought a flashlight with a very big battery,

139
0:06:10.772,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and a bunch of small speakers.

140
0:06:12.562,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So essentially, the mobile phone gives us

141
0:06:14.86,000 --> 0:06:15,000
a connected multimedia platform.

142
0:06:16.784,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It allows us to get online and allows us to load up files

143
0:06:20.269,000 --> 0:06:22,000
of different formats and play them.

144
0:06:22.62,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The flashlight gives us this really intense, bright L.E.D.,

145
0:06:25.646,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack,

146
0:06:28.637,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and the lunch box is a nice little package

147
0:06:30.853,000 --> 0:06:32,000
in which you can put everything inside,

148
0:06:32.9,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and a bunch of mini speakers to sort of

149
0:06:34.463,000 --> 0:06:35,000
amplify the sound large enough.

150
0:06:35.881,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Believe me, those little classrooms are really noisy.

151
0:06:39.42,000 --> 0:06:41,000
They are kids who scream at the top of their voices,

152
0:06:42.013,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and you really have to get above that.

153
0:06:43.673,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And we took it back to this little tinkering setup

154
0:06:46.394,000 --> 0:06:48,000
of a mobile phone repair shop,

155
0:06:48.484,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and then the magic happens.

156
0:06:49.912,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We dismantle the whole thing,

157
0:06:51.293,000 --> 0:06:53,000
we reassemble it in a new configuration,

158
0:06:53.65,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and we do this hardware mashup,

159
0:06:55.828,000 --> 0:06:57,000
systematically training the guy how to do this.

160
0:06:58.437,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Out comes this, a little lunch box -- form factor.

161
0:07:01.892,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Applause)

162
0:07:08.718,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And we systematically field tested,

163
0:07:11.736,000 --> 0:07:13,000
because in the field testing we learned some

164
0:07:14.104,000 --> 0:07:16,000
important lessons, and we went through many iterations.

165
0:07:16.621,000 --> 0:07:18,000
One of the key issues was battery consumption and charging.

166
0:07:19.316,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Luminosity was an issue, when you have too much bright sunlight outside.

167
0:07:23.294,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Often the roofs are broken, so you don't have enough

168
0:07:25.846,000 --> 0:07:28,000
darkness in the classroom to do these things.

169
0:07:28.974,000 --> 0:07:3,000
We extended this idea. We tested it many times over,

170
0:07:31.816,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and the next version we came up with was a box

171
0:07:34.394,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that kind of could trickle charge on solar energy,

172
0:07:36.774,000 --> 0:07:38,000
but most importantly connect to a car battery,

173
0:07:39.573,000 --> 0:07:41,000
because a car battery is a ubiquitous source of power

174
0:07:42.567,000 --> 0:07:44,000
in places where there's not enough electricity

175
0:07:44.774,000 --> 0:07:45,000
or erratic electricity.

176
0:07:46.734,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And the other key thing that we did was

177
0:07:48.703,000 --> 0:07:5,000
make this box run off a USB key, because we realized

178
0:07:51.165,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that even though there was GPRS and all that on paper,

179
0:07:54.519,000 --> 0:07:56,000
at least, in theory, it was much more efficient

180
0:07:57.094,000 --> 0:08:,000
to send the data on a little USB key by surface mail.

181
0:08:00.984,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It might take a few days to get there,

182
0:08:02.824,000 --> 0:08:04,000
but at least it gets there in high definition

183
0:08:05.198,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and in a reliable quality.

184
0:08:07.413,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So we made this box, and we tested it again

185
0:08:09.695,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and again and again, and we're going through

186
0:08:11.23,000 --> 0:08:12,000
multiple iterations to do these things.

187
0:08:12.779,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But it's not limited to just education.

188
0:08:15.748,000 --> 0:08:16,000
This kind of a technique or metrology

189
0:08:17.614,000 --> 0:08:19,000
can actually be applied to other kinds of areas,

190
0:08:19.626,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and I'm going to tell you one more little story.

191
0:08:21.534,000 --> 0:08:23,000
It's about this little device called a medi-meter.

192
0:08:23.989,000 --> 0:08:26,000
It's basically a little health care screening tool that we developed.

193
0:08:27.356,000 --> 0:08:3,000
In India, there is a context of these amazing people,

194
0:08:30.683,000 --> 0:08:32,000
the health care workers called ASHA workers.

195
0:08:32.962,000 --> 0:08:34,000
They are essentially foot soldiers for the health care system

196
0:08:35.379,000 --> 0:08:37,000
who live in the local community and are trained

197
0:08:37.763,000 --> 0:08:39,000
with basic tools and basic concepts of health care,

198
0:08:40.331,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and the main purpose is basically to inform people

199
0:08:44.093,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to basically, how to lead a better life, but also

200
0:08:47.626,000 --> 0:08:5,000
to divert or sort of make recommendations

201
0:08:50.854,000 --> 0:08:52,000
of what kind of health care should they approach?

202
0:08:53.528,000 --> 0:08:55,000
They are basically referral services, essentially.

203
0:08:56.24,000 --> 0:08:58,000
But the problem with that is that we realized

204
0:08:58.548,000 --> 0:09:02,000
after a bunch of research that they are amazing

205
0:09:02.738,000 --> 0:09:04,000
at referring people to the nearest clinic

206
0:09:05.218,000 --> 0:09:07,000
or the public health care system, but what happens at the

207
0:09:08.091,000 --> 0:09:12,000
public health care system is this: these incredibly long lines

208
0:09:12.169,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and too many people who overload the system

209
0:09:14.979,000 --> 0:09:16,000
simply because there's not enough doctors and facilities

210
0:09:17.545,000 --> 0:09:19,000
for the population that's being referred.

211
0:09:19.747,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So everything from a common cold

212
0:09:21.866,000 --> 0:09:23,000
to a serious case of malaria gets almost the same

213
0:09:24.526,000 --> 0:09:27,000
level of attention, and there's no priorities.

214
0:09:27.57,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So we said, "Come on, there's got to be a better way

215
0:09:29.641,000 --> 0:09:3,000
of doing this for sure."

216
0:09:31.442,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So we said, "What can we do with the ASHA worker

217
0:09:34.019,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that'll allow this ASHA worker to become an interesting filter,

218
0:09:37.95,000 --> 0:09:39,000
but not just a filter, a really well thought through referral

219
0:09:40.465,000 --> 0:09:43,000
system that allows load balancing of the network,

220
0:09:43.946,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and directs patients to different sources of health care

221
0:09:47.885,000 --> 0:09:5,000
based on the severity or the criticalness of those situations?"

222
0:09:51.765,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So the real key question was,

223
0:09:53.746,000 --> 0:09:54,000
how do we empower this woman?

224
0:09:55.414,000 --> 0:09:56,000
How do we empower her with simple tools

225
0:09:57.341,000 --> 0:09:59,000
that's not diagnostic but more screening in nature

226
0:10:00.292,000 --> 0:10:03,000
so she at least knows how to advise the patients better?

227
0:10:04.072,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And that'll make such a huge difference on the system,

228
0:10:06.1,000 --> 0:10:1,000
because the amount of waiting time and the amount of

229
0:10:11.018,000 --> 0:10:12,000
distances that people need to travel, often sometimes

230
0:10:12.938,000 --> 0:10:14,000
seven to 15 kilometers, sometimes by foot,

231
0:10:15.611,000 --> 0:10:2,000
to get a simple health check done, is very, very detrimental

232
0:10:21.074,000 --> 0:10:23,000
in the sense that it really dissuades people

233
0:10:23.528,000 --> 0:10:25,000
from getting access to health care.

234
0:10:25.537,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So if there was something that she could do,

235
0:10:27.572,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that would be amazing.

236
0:10:28.681,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So what we did was that we converted this device

237
0:10:31.742,000 --> 0:10:32,000
into a medical device.

238
0:10:33.559,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I want to demo this actually,

239
0:10:34.835,000 --> 0:10:36,000
because it's a very simple process.

240
0:10:37.508,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Bruno, do you want to join us? (Cheers)

241
0:10:39.917,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Come along. (Applause)

242
0:10:46.119,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So, what we're going to do is that

243
0:10:49.044,000 --> 0:10:51,000
we're going to measure a few basic parameters on you,

244
0:10:52.016,000 --> 0:10:54,000
including your pulse rate and the amount of oxygen

245
0:10:54.871,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that's there in your blood.

246
0:10:56.744,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So you're going to put your thumb on top of this.

247
0:11:00.035,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Bruno Giussani: Like this, works?

248
0:11:01.809,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Vinay Venkatraman: Yeah. That's right. BG: Okay.

249
0:11:03.475,000 --> 0:11:07,000
VV: So I'm going to start it up. I hope it works.

250
0:11:07.483,000 --> 0:11:11,000
(Beeps) It even beeps, because it's an alarm clock, after all.

251
0:11:11.833,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So ... (Laughter)

252
0:11:13.845,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So I take it into the start position, and then

253
0:11:18.236,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I press the read button. (Beeps)

254
0:11:21.848,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So it's taking a little reading from you. (Beeps)

255
0:11:27.329,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And then the pointer goes and points to three different options.

256
0:11:30.107,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Let's see what happens here.

257
0:11:33.382,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Beeps) Oh Bruno, you can go home, actually.

258
0:11:35.465,000 --> 0:11:38,000
BG: Great. Good news. (Applause)

259
0:11:39.301,000 --> 0:11:41,000
VV: So ... (Applause)

260
0:11:41.646,000 --> 0:11:44,000
So the thing about this is that

261
0:11:44.863,000 --> 0:11:48,000
if the pointer, unfortunately, had pointed to the red spot,

262
0:11:48.968,000 --> 0:11:49,000
we would have to rush you to a hospital.

263
0:11:50.814,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Luckily, not today. And if it had pointed to the orange

264
0:11:54.934,000 --> 0:11:56,000
or the amber, it basically meant you had to have,

265
0:11:57.763,000 --> 0:12:,000
sort of, more continuous care from the health care worker.

266
0:12:00.807,000 --> 0:12:02,000
So that was a very simple three-step screening process

267
0:12:03.158,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that could basically change the equation

268
0:12:05.273,000 --> 0:12:07,000
of how public health care works in so many different ways.

269
0:12:08.013,000 --> 0:12:09,000
BG: Thank you for the good news. VV: Yeah.

270
0:12:09.91,000 --> 0:12:13,000
(Applause)

271
0:12:14.303,000 --> 0:12:17,000
So, very briefly, I'll just explain to you how this is done,

272
0:12:17.743,000 --> 0:12:19,000
because that's the more interesting part.

273
0:12:20.033,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So essentially, the three things that are required

274
0:12:22.727,000 --> 0:12:26,000
to make this conversion from this guy to this guy

275
0:12:27.255,000 --> 0:12:31,000
is a cheap remote control for a television

276
0:12:31.384,000 --> 0:12:33,000
that you can almost find in every home today,

277
0:12:34.295,000 --> 0:12:37,000
some parts from a computer mouse, basically,

278
0:12:38.009,000 --> 0:12:41,000
something that you can scavenge for very low cost,

279
0:12:41.872,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and a few parts that have to be pre-programmed.

280
0:12:44.783,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Basically this is a micro-controller with a few

281
0:12:47.184,000 --> 0:12:49,000
extra components that can be shipped for very little cost

282
0:12:49.979,000 --> 0:12:51,000
across the world, and that's what is all required

283
0:12:52.972,000 --> 0:12:54,000
with a little bit of local tinkering talent

284
0:12:55.363,000 --> 0:12:57,000
to convert the device into something else.

285
0:12:58.15,000 --> 0:13:01,000
So we are right now doing some systematic field tests

286
0:13:01.546,000 --> 0:13:04,000
to basically ascertain whether something like this actually

287
0:13:04.596,000 --> 0:13:05,000
makes sense to the ASHA worker.

288
0:13:06.163,000 --> 0:13:09,000
We are going through some reference tests to compare it

289
0:13:09.707,000 --> 0:13:12,000
against professional equipment to see if there's a degree

290
0:13:13.165,000 --> 0:13:15,000
of change in efficacy and if it actually makes an impact

291
0:13:15.487,000 --> 0:13:17,000
in people's lives. But most importantly,

292
0:13:18.095,000 --> 0:13:19,000
what we are trying to do right now

293
0:13:19.89,000 --> 0:13:21,000
is we are trying to scale this up, because there

294
0:13:22.144,000 --> 0:13:24,000
are over 250,000 ASHA workers on the ground

295
0:13:24.831,000 --> 0:13:26,000
who are these amazing foot soldiers, and if we can

296
0:13:27.568,000 --> 0:13:3,000
give at least a fraction of them the access to these things,

297
0:13:31.128,000 --> 0:13:33,000
it just changes the way the economics of public health care

298
0:13:34.086,000 --> 0:13:37,000
works, and it changes the way systems actually function,

299
0:13:37.097,000 --> 0:13:41,000
not just on a systematic planning level,

300
0:13:41.363,000 --> 0:13:44,000
but also in a very grassroots, bottom-up level.

301
0:13:44.548,000 --> 0:13:46,000
So that's it, and we hope to do this in a big way.

302
0:13:47.349,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Thank you. (Applause)

303
0:13:50.507,000 --> 0:13:58,000
(Applause)

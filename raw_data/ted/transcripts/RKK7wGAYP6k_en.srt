1
0:00:12.94,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So, I'll be speaking to you using language ...

2
0:00:16.09,000 --> 0:00:17,000
because I can.

3
0:00:17.634,000 --> 0:00:2,000
This is one these magical abilities that we humans have.

4
0:00:21.114,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We can transmit really complicated thoughts to one another.

5
0:00:25.479,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So what I'm doing right now is, I'm making sounds with my mouth

6
0:00:29.098,000 --> 0:00:3,000
as I'm exhaling.

7
0:00:30.337,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I'm making tones and hisses and puffs,

8
0:00:32.709,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and those are creating air vibrations in the air.

9
0:00:35.743,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Those air vibrations are traveling to you,

10
0:00:38.213,000 --> 0:00:39,000
they're hitting your eardrums,

11
0:00:40.022,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and then your brain takes those vibrations from your eardrums

12
0:00:44.626,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and transforms them into thoughts.

13
0:00:48.031,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I hope.

14
0:00:49.206,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:50.233,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I hope that's happening.

16
0:00:51.414,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So because of this ability, we humans are able to transmit our ideas

17
0:00:56.014,000 --> 0:00:58,000
across vast reaches of space and time.

18
0:00:58.73,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We're able to transmit knowledge across minds.

19
0:01:03.29,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I can put a bizarre new idea in your mind right now.

20
0:01:06.475,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I could say,

21
0:01:08.367,000 --> 0:01:11,000
"Imagine a jellyfish waltzing in a library

22
0:01:11.599,000 --> 0:01:13,000
while thinking about quantum mechanics."

23
0:01:13.799,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:15.221,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Now, if everything has gone relatively well in your life so far,

25
0:01:18.273,000 --> 0:01:2,000
you probably haven't had that thought before.

26
0:01:20.409,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:21.435,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But now I've just made you think it,

28
0:01:23.191,000 --> 0:01:24,000
through language.

29
0:01:24.654,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Now of course, there isn't just one language in the world,

30
0:01:27.402,000 --> 0:01:29,000
there are about 7,000 languages spoken around the world.

31
0:01:30.071,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And all the languages differ from one another in all kinds of ways.

32
0:01:33.255,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Some languages have different sounds,

33
0:01:36.37,000 --> 0:01:37,000
they have different vocabularies,

34
0:01:38.113,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and they also have different structures --

35
0:01:40.176,000 --> 0:01:41,000
very importantly, different structures.

36
0:01:42.896,000 --> 0:01:43,000
That begs the question:

37
0:01:44.112,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Does the language we speak shape the way we think?

38
0:01:46.748,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Now, this is an ancient question.

39
0:01:48.344,000 --> 0:01:51,000
People have been speculating about this question forever.

40
0:01:51.539,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Charlemagne, Holy Roman emperor, said,

41
0:01:53.88,000 --> 0:01:56,000
"To have a second language is to have a second soul" --

42
0:01:56.94,000 --> 0:01:58,000
strong statement that language crafts reality.

43
0:01:59.992,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But on the other hand, Shakespeare has Juliet say,

44
0:02:03.006,000 --> 0:02:04,000
"What's in a name?

45
0:02:04.181,000 --> 0:02:06,000
A rose by any other name would smell as sweet."

46
0:02:07.504,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Well, that suggests that maybe language doesn't craft reality.

47
0:02:10.926,000 --> 0:02:14,000
These arguments have gone back and forth for thousands of years.

48
0:02:15.4,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But until recently, there hasn't been any data

49
0:02:18.155,000 --> 0:02:19,000
to help us decide either way.

50
0:02:20.23,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Recently, in my lab and other labs around the world,

51
0:02:22.706,000 --> 0:02:23,000
we've started doing research,

52
0:02:24.122,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and now we have actual scientific data to weigh in on this question.

53
0:02:28.918,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So let me tell you about some of my favorite examples.

54
0:02:31.846,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I'll start with an example from an Aboriginal community in Australia

55
0:02:35.284,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that I had the chance to work with.

56
0:02:37.036,000 --> 0:02:38,000
These are the Kuuk Thaayorre people.

57
0:02:38.803,000 --> 0:02:41,000
They live in Pormpuraaw at the very west edge of Cape York.

58
0:02:43.351,000 --> 0:02:45,000
What's cool about Kuuk Thaayorre is,

59
0:02:45.611,000 --> 0:02:48,000
in Kuuk Thaayorre, they don't use words like "left" and "right,"

60
0:02:48.693,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and instead, everything is in cardinal directions:

61
0:02:51.401,000 --> 0:02:52,000
north, south, east and west.

62
0:02:53.425,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And when I say everything, I really mean everything.

63
0:02:55.984,000 --> 0:02:56,000
You would say something like,

64
0:02:57.559,000 --> 0:02:59,000
"Oh, there's an ant on your southwest leg."

65
0:03:01.178,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Or, "Move your cup to the north-northeast a little bit."

66
0:03:04.404,000 --> 0:03:07,000
In fact, the way that you say "hello" in Kuuk Thaayorre is you say,

67
0:03:07.908,000 --> 0:03:08,000
"Which way are you going?"

68
0:03:09.198,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And the answer should be,

69
0:03:11.014,000 --> 0:03:12,000
"North-northeast in the far distance.

70
0:03:12.81,000 --> 0:03:13,000
How about you?"

71
0:03:14.155,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So imagine as you're walking around your day,

72
0:03:17.311,000 --> 0:03:18,000
every person you greet,

73
0:03:18.884,000 --> 0:03:2,000
you have to report your heading direction.

74
0:03:20.979,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:22.182,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But that would actually get you oriented pretty fast, right?

76
0:03:25.537,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Because you literally couldn't get past "hello,"

77
0:03:28.521,000 --> 0:03:3,000
if you didn't know which way you were going.

78
0:03:31.969,000 --> 0:03:34,000
In fact, people who speak languages like this stay oriented really well.

79
0:03:35.485,000 --> 0:03:37,000
They stay oriented better than we used to think humans could.

80
0:03:38.84,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We used to think that humans were worse than other creatures

81
0:03:41.716,000 --> 0:03:42,000
because of some biological excuse:

82
0:03:43.456,000 --> 0:03:46,000
"Oh, we don't have magnets in our beaks or in our scales."

83
0:03:46.805,000 --> 0:03:48,000
No; if your language and your culture trains you to do it,

84
0:03:49.771,000 --> 0:03:5,000
actually, you can do it.

85
0:03:51.044,000 --> 0:03:54,000
There are humans around the world who stay oriented really well.

86
0:03:54.108,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And just to get us in agreement

87
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
about how different this is from the way we do it,

88
0:03:58.879,000 --> 0:04:,000
I want you all to close your eyes for a second

89
0:04:02.887,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and point southeast.

90
0:04:04.264,000 --> 0:04:05,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:05.998,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Keep your eyes closed. Point.

92
0:04:10.095,000 --> 0:04:12,000
OK, so you can open your eyes.

93
0:04:12.136,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I see you guys pointing there, there, there, there, there ...

94
0:04:16.529,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I don't know which way it is myself --

95
0:04:18.431,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:20.119,000 --> 0:04:21,000
You have not been a lot of help.

97
0:04:21.801,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:23.142,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So let's just say the accuracy in this room was not very high.

99
0:04:26.086,000 --> 0:04:29,000
This is a big difference in cognitive ability across languages, right?

100
0:04:29.47,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Where one group -- very distinguished group like you guys --

101
0:04:32.889,000 --> 0:04:33,000
doesn't know which way is which,

102
0:04:34.476,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but in another group,

103
0:04:35.836,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I could ask a five-year-old and they would know.

104
0:04:38.15,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Laughter)

105
0:04:39.258,000 --> 0:04:42,000
There are also really big differences in how people think about time.

106
0:04:42.702,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So here I have pictures of my grandfather at different ages.

107
0:04:46.743,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And if I ask an English speaker to organize time,

108
0:04:49.994,000 --> 0:04:5,000
they might lay it out this way,

109
0:04:51.503,000 --> 0:04:52,000
from left to right.

110
0:04:52.678,000 --> 0:04:53,000
This has to do with writing direction.

111
0:04:54.533,000 --> 0:04:56,000
If you were a speaker of Hebrew or Arabic,

112
0:04:56.583,000 --> 0:04:58,000
you might do it going in the opposite direction,

113
0:04:58.897,000 --> 0:04:59,000
from right to left.

114
0:05:01.578,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But how would the Kuuk Thaayorre,

115
0:05:03.187,000 --> 0:05:05,000
this Aboriginal group I just told you about, do it?

116
0:05:05.605,000 --> 0:05:07,000
They don't use words like "left" and "right."

117
0:05:07.747,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Let me give you hint.

118
0:05:09.263,000 --> 0:05:11,000
When we sat people facing south,

119
0:05:11.838,000 --> 0:05:12,000
they organized time from left to right.

120
0:05:14.391,000 --> 0:05:16,000
When we sat them facing north,

121
0:05:16.598,000 --> 0:05:17,000
they organized time from right to left.

122
0:05:19.026,000 --> 0:05:21,000
When we sat them facing east,

123
0:05:21.105,000 --> 0:05:22,000
time came towards the body.

124
0:05:23.608,000 --> 0:05:24,000
What's the pattern?

125
0:05:26.056,000 --> 0:05:27,000
East to west, right?

126
0:05:27.779,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So for them, time doesn't actually get locked on the body at all,

127
0:05:31.305,000 --> 0:05:32,000
it gets locked on the landscape.

128
0:05:32.869,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So for me, if I'm facing this way,

129
0:05:34.611,000 --> 0:05:35,000
then time goes this way,

130
0:05:35.792,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and if I'm facing this way, then time goes this way.

131
0:05:38.289,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I'm facing this way, time goes this way --

132
0:05:40.313,000 --> 0:05:43,000
very egocentric of me to have the direction of time chase me around

133
0:05:44.304,000 --> 0:05:45,000
every time I turn my body.

134
0:05:46.598,000 --> 0:05:48,000
For the Kuuk Thaayorre, time is locked on the landscape.

135
0:05:49.269,000 --> 0:05:51,000
It's a dramatically different way of thinking about time.

136
0:05:52.112,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Here's another really smart human trick.

137
0:05:54.047,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Suppose I ask you how many penguins are there.

138
0:05:56.958,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Well, I bet I know how you'd solve that problem if you solved it.

139
0:06:00.136,000 --> 0:06:02,000
You went, "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight."

140
0:06:02.987,000 --> 0:06:03,000
You counted them.

141
0:06:04.175,000 --> 0:06:05,000
You named each one with a number,

142
0:06:05.808,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and the last number you said was the number of penguins.

143
0:06:08.468,000 --> 0:06:1,000
This is a little trick that you're taught to use as kids.

144
0:06:11.354,000 --> 0:06:14,000
You learn the number list and you learn how to apply it.

145
0:06:14.787,000 --> 0:06:15,000
A little linguistic trick.

146
0:06:16.804,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Well, some languages don't do this,

147
0:06:18.505,000 --> 0:06:21,000
because some languages don't have exact number words.

148
0:06:22.039,000 --> 0:06:24,000
They're languages that don't have a word like "seven"

149
0:06:24.96,000 --> 0:06:25,000
or a word like "eight."

150
0:06:27.033,000 --> 0:06:29,000
In fact, people who speak these languages don't count,

151
0:06:29.715,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and they have trouble keeping track of exact quantities.

152
0:06:32.736,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So, for example, if I ask you to match this number of penguins

153
0:06:36.689,000 --> 0:06:38,000
to the same number of ducks,

154
0:06:38.977,000 --> 0:06:4,000
you would be able to do that by counting.

155
0:06:41.145,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But folks who don't have that linguistic trick can't do that.

156
0:06:47.653,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Languages also differ in how they divide up the color spectrum --

157
0:06:50.831,000 --> 0:06:51,000
the visual world.

158
0:06:52.348,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Some languages have lots of words for colors,

159
0:06:54.524,000 --> 0:06:56,000
some have only a couple words, "light" and "dark."

160
0:06:56.912,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And languages differ in where they put boundaries between colors.

161
0:07:00.559,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So, for example, in English, there's a word for blue

162
0:07:03.798,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that covers all of the colors that you can see on the screen,

163
0:07:06.957,000 --> 0:07:08,000
but in Russian, there isn't a single word.

164
0:07:08.987,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Instead, Russian speakers have to differentiate

165
0:07:11.217,000 --> 0:07:12,000
between light blue, "goluboy,"

166
0:07:12.712,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and dark blue, "siniy."

167
0:07:15.138,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So Russians have this lifetime of experience of, in language,

168
0:07:19.145,000 --> 0:07:2,000
distinguishing these two colors.

169
0:07:21.038,000 --> 0:07:24,000
When we test people's ability to perceptually discriminate these colors,

170
0:07:25.025,000 --> 0:07:27,000
what we find is that Russian speakers are faster

171
0:07:27.57,000 --> 0:07:28,000
across this linguistic boundary.

172
0:07:29.152,000 --> 0:07:31,000
They're faster to be able to tell the difference

173
0:07:31.458,000 --> 0:07:32,000
between a light and dark blue.

174
0:07:33.299,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And when you look at people's brains as they're looking at colors --

175
0:07:36.587,000 --> 0:07:39,000
say you have colors shifting slowly from light to dark blue --

176
0:07:40.798,000 --> 0:07:44,000
the brains of people who use different words for light and dark blue

177
0:07:45.274,000 --> 0:07:48,000
will give a surprised reaction as the colors shift from light to dark,

178
0:07:48.808,000 --> 0:07:51,000
as if, "Ooh, something has categorically changed,"

179
0:07:52.014,000 --> 0:07:54,000
whereas the brains of English speakers, for example,

180
0:07:54.484,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that don't make this categorical distinction,

181
0:07:56.648,000 --> 0:07:57,000
don't give that surprise,

182
0:07:57.868,000 --> 0:07:59,000
because nothing is categorically changing.

183
0:08:02.054,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Languages have all kinds of structural quirks.

184
0:08:04.582,000 --> 0:08:05,000
This is one of my favorites.

185
0:08:05.943,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Lots of languages have grammatical gender;

186
0:08:08.399,000 --> 0:08:12,000
every noun gets assigned a gender, often masculine or feminine.

187
0:08:13.053,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And these genders differ across languages.

188
0:08:15.134,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So, for example, the sun is feminine in German but masculine in Spanish,

189
0:08:19.699,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and the moon, the reverse.

190
0:08:21.634,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Could this actually have any consequence for how people think?

191
0:08:25.12,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Do German speakers think of the sun as somehow more female-like,

192
0:08:29.138,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and the moon somehow more male-like?

193
0:08:31.767,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Actually, it turns out that's the case.

194
0:08:33.697,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So if you ask German and Spanish speakers to, say, describe a bridge,

195
0:08:39.144,000 --> 0:08:4,000
like the one here --

196
0:08:40.604,000 --> 0:08:43,000
"bridge" happens to be grammatically feminine in German,

197
0:08:43.977,000 --> 0:08:45,000
grammatically masculine in Spanish --

198
0:08:46.157,000 --> 0:08:5,000
German speakers are more likely to say bridges are "beautiful," "elegant"

199
0:08:50.499,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and stereotypically feminine words.

200
0:08:52.65,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Whereas Spanish speakers will be more likely to say

201
0:08:55.183,000 --> 0:08:56,000
they're "strong" or "long,"

202
0:08:56.753,000 --> 0:08:57,000
these masculine words.

203
0:09:00.849,000 --> 0:09:01,000
(Laughter)

204
0:09:03.396,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Languages also differ in how they describe events, right?

205
0:09:08.06,000 --> 0:09:1,000
You take an event like this, an accident.

206
0:09:10.43,000 --> 0:09:12,000
In English, it's fine to say, "He broke the vase."

207
0:09:13.869,000 --> 0:09:15,000
In a language like Spanish,

208
0:09:16.437,000 --> 0:09:18,000
you might be more likely to say, "The vase broke,"

209
0:09:19.308,000 --> 0:09:2,000
or, "The vase broke itself."

210
0:09:21.332,000 --> 0:09:24,000
If it's an accident, you wouldn't say that someone did it.

211
0:09:24.578,000 --> 0:09:27,000
In English, quite weirdly, we can even say things like,

212
0:09:28.008,000 --> 0:09:29,000
"I broke my arm."

213
0:09:29.953,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Now, in lots of languages,

214
0:09:31.811,000 --> 0:09:34,000
you couldn't use that construction unless you are a lunatic

215
0:09:35.006,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and you went out looking to break your arm --

216
0:09:37.159,000 --> 0:09:38,000
(Laughter)

217
0:09:38.185,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and you succeeded.

218
0:09:39.36,000 --> 0:09:42,000
If it was an accident, you would use a different construction.

219
0:09:42.648,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Now, this has consequences.

220
0:09:44.477,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So, people who speak different languages will pay attention to different things,

221
0:09:48.689,000 --> 0:09:51,000
depending on what their language usually requires them to do.

222
0:09:52.119,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So we show the same accident to English speakers and Spanish speakers,

223
0:09:56.315,000 --> 0:09:59,000
English speakers will remember who did it,

224
0:10:00.525,000 --> 0:10:03,000
because English requires you to say, "He did it; he broke the vase."

225
0:10:03.963,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Whereas Spanish speakers might be less likely to remember who did it

226
0:10:07.19,000 --> 0:10:08,000
if it's an accident,

227
0:10:08.365,000 --> 0:10:1,000
but they're more likely to remember that it was an accident.

228
0:10:11.218,000 --> 0:10:13,000
They're more likely to remember the intention.

229
0:10:13.678,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So, two people watch the same event,

230
0:10:16.785,000 --> 0:10:18,000
witness the same crime,

231
0:10:18.89,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but end up remembering different things about that event.

232
0:10:22.564,000 --> 0:10:25,000
This has implications, of course, for eyewitness testimony.

233
0:10:26.59,000 --> 0:10:28,000
It also has implications for blame and punishment.

234
0:10:28.976,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So if you take English speakers

235
0:10:30.807,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and I just show you someone breaking a vase,

236
0:10:32.995,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and I say, "He broke the vase," as opposed to "The vase broke,"

237
0:10:37.504,000 --> 0:10:38,000
even though you can witness it yourself,

238
0:10:39.441,000 --> 0:10:4,000
you can watch the video,

239
0:10:40.733,000 --> 0:10:42,000
you can watch the crime against the vase,

240
0:10:44.157,000 --> 0:10:45,000
you will punish someone more,

241
0:10:45.948,000 --> 0:10:47,000
you will blame someone more if I just said, "He broke it,"

242
0:10:48.825,000 --> 0:10:49,000
as opposed to, "It broke."

243
0:10:50.931,000 --> 0:10:53,000
The language guides our reasoning about events.

244
0:10:55.996,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Now, I've given you a few examples

245
0:10:58.906,000 --> 0:11:01,000
of how language can profoundly shape the way we think,

246
0:11:02.657,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and it does so in a variety of ways.

247
0:11:04.856,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So language can have big effects,

248
0:11:06.811,000 --> 0:11:07,000
like we saw with space and time,

249
0:11:08.577,000 --> 0:11:09,000
where people can lay out space and time

250
0:11:10.507,000 --> 0:11:13,000
in completely different coordinate frames from each other.

251
0:11:14.781,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Language can also have really deep effects --

252
0:11:17.039,000 --> 0:11:19,000
that's what we saw with the case of number.

253
0:11:19.572,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Having count words in your language,

254
0:11:21.639,000 --> 0:11:22,000
having number words,

255
0:11:22.883,000 --> 0:11:24,000
opens up the whole world of mathematics.

256
0:11:25.468,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Of course, if you don't count, you can't do algebra,

257
0:11:27.995,000 --> 0:11:28,000
you can't do any of the things

258
0:11:29.583,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that would be required to build a room like this

259
0:11:32.35,000 --> 0:11:34,000
or make this broadcast, right?

260
0:11:34.836,000 --> 0:11:36,000
This little trick of number words gives you a stepping stone

261
0:11:37.723,000 --> 0:11:38,000
into a whole cognitive realm.

262
0:11:40.42,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Language can also have really early effects,

263
0:11:42.739,000 --> 0:11:44,000
what we saw in the case of color.

264
0:11:46.205,000 --> 0:11:48,000
These are really simple, basic, perceptual decisions.

265
0:11:48.723,000 --> 0:11:5,000
We make thousands of them all the time,

266
0:11:51.107,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and yet, language is getting in there

267
0:11:52.948,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and fussing even with these tiny little perceptual decisions that we make.

268
0:11:58.787,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Language can have really broad effects.

269
0:12:00.67,000 --> 0:12:03,000
So the case of grammatical gender may be a little silly,

270
0:12:03.922,000 --> 0:12:06,000
but at the same time, grammatical gender applies to all nouns.

271
0:12:08.061,000 --> 0:12:1,000
That means language can shape how you're thinking

272
0:12:10.374,000 --> 0:12:12,000
about anything that can be named by a noun.

273
0:12:14.185,000 --> 0:12:15,000
That's a lot of stuff.

274
0:12:16.449,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And finally, I gave you an example of how language can shape things

275
0:12:19.73,000 --> 0:12:2,000
that have personal weight to us --

276
0:12:21.39,000 --> 0:12:23,000
ideas like blame and punishment or eyewitness memory.

277
0:12:23.99,000 --> 0:12:25,000
These are important things in our daily lives.

278
0:12:28.153,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Now, the beauty of linguistic diversity is that it reveals to us

279
0:12:33.178,000 --> 0:12:36,000
just how ingenious and how flexible the human mind is.

280
0:12:37.775,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Human minds have invented not one cognitive universe, but 7,000 --

281
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
there are 7,000 languages spoken around the world.

282
0:12:46.01,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And we can create many more --

283
0:12:47.711,000 --> 0:12:5,000
languages, of course, are living things,

284
0:12:50.818,000 --> 0:12:53,000
things that we can hone and change to suit our needs.

285
0:12:55.786,000 --> 0:12:58,000
The tragic thing is that we're losing so much of this linguistic diversity

286
0:12:59.293,000 --> 0:13:,000
all the time.

287
0:13:00.468,000 --> 0:13:01,000
We're losing about one language a week,

288
0:13:02.384,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and by some estimates,

289
0:13:03.874,000 --> 0:13:06,000
half of the world's languages will be gone in the next hundred years.

290
0:13:07.966,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And the even worse news is that right now,

291
0:13:10.812,000 --> 0:13:13,000
almost everything we know about the human mind and human brain

292
0:13:14.544,000 --> 0:13:19,000
is based on studies of usually American English-speaking undergraduates

293
0:13:19.596,000 --> 0:13:2,000
at universities.

294
0:13:22.742,000 --> 0:13:25,000
That excludes almost all humans. Right?

295
0:13:26.299,000 --> 0:13:3,000
So what we know about the human mind is actually incredibly narrow and biased,

296
0:13:31.294,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and our science has to do better.

297
0:13:37.987,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I want to leave you with this final thought.

298
0:13:40.27,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I've told you about how speakers of different languages think differently,

299
0:13:43.807,000 --> 0:13:46,000
but of course, that's not about how people elsewhere think.

300
0:13:47.115,000 --> 0:13:48,000
It's about how you think.

301
0:13:48.558,000 --> 0:13:51,000
It's how the language that you speak shapes the way that you think.

302
0:13:53.07,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And that gives you the opportunity to ask,

303
0:13:55.67,000 --> 0:13:57,000
"Why do I think the way that I do?"

304
0:13:57.765,000 --> 0:13:58,000
"How could I think differently?"

305
0:13:59.908,000 --> 0:14:,000
And also,

306
0:14:01.297,000 --> 0:14:02,000
"What thoughts do I wish to create?"

307
0:14:03.842,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Thank you very much.

308
0:14:05.025,000 --> 0:14:07,000
(Applause)

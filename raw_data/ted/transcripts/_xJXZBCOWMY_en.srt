1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
What's happening in genomics,

2
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and how this revolution is about to change everything we know

3
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
about the world, life, ourselves, and how we think about them.

4
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
If you saw 2001: A Space Odyssey,

5
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and you heard the boom, boom, boom, boom, and you saw the monolith,

6
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
you know, that was Arthur C. Clarke's representation

7
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species.

8
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
In this case, it was picking up bones and creating a tool,

9
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
using it as a tool, which meant that apes just, sort of,

10
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
running around and eating and doing each other

11
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
figured out they can make things if they used a tool.

12
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And that moved us to the next level.

13
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And, you know, we in the last 30 years in particular

14
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology,

15
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools.

16
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And we've seen many seminal moments.

17
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We've seen the creation of small computers in the '70s and early '80s,

18
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and who would have thought back then that every single person

19
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
would not have just one computer but probably 20,

20
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
in your home, and in not just your P.C. but in every device --

21
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
in your washing machine, your cell phone.

22
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
You're walking around; your car has 12 microprocessors.

23
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Then we go along and create the Internet

24
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and connect the world together; we flatten the world.

25
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
We've seen so much change, and we've given ourselves these tools now --

26
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
these high-powered tools --

27
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that are allowing us to turn the lens inward

28
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
into something that is common to all of us, and that is a genome.

29
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
How's your genome today? Have you thought about it lately?

30
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Heard about it, at least? You probably hear about genomes these days.

31
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I thought I'd take a moment to tell you what a genome is.

32
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It's, sort of, like if you ask people,

33
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Well, what is a megabyte or megabit? And what is broadband?

34
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
People never want to say, I really don't understand.

35
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So, I will tell you right off of the bat.

36
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
You've heard of DNA; you probably studied a little bit in biology.

37
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
A genome is really a description for all of the DNA that is in a living organism.

38
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And one thing that is common to all of life is DNA.

39
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
It doesn't matter whether you're a yeast;

40
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
it doesn't matter whether you're a mouse;

41
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
doesn't matter whether you're a fly; we all have DNA.

42
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The DNA is organized in words, call them: genes and chromosomes.

43
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And when Watson and Crick in the '50s

44
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
first decoded this beautiful double helix that we know as the DNA molecule --

45
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
very long, complicated molecule --

46
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
we then started on this journey to understand that

47
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
inside of that DNA is a language that determines the characteristics, our traits,

48
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
what we inherit, what diseases we may get.

49
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule,

50
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that all of the DNA in your body has been around forever,

51
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
since the beginning of us, of us as creatures.

52
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
There is a historical archive.

53
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Living in your genome is the history of our species,

54
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and you as an individual human being, where you're from,

55
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years,

56
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and that's now starting to be understood.

57
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But also, the genome is really the instruction manual.

58
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It is the program. It is the code of life.

59
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It is what makes you function;

60
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
it is what makes every organism function.

61
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
DNA is a very elegant molecule.

62
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It's long and it's complicated.

63
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Really all you have to know about it is that there's four letters:

64
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
A, T, C, G; they represent the name of a chemical.

65
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And with these four letters, you can create a language:

66
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
a language that can describe anything, and very complicated things.

67
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
You know, they are generally put together in pairs,

68
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
creating a word or what we call base pairs.

69
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And you would, you know, when you think about it,

70
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
four letters, or the representation of four things, makes us work.

71
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And that may not sound very intuitive,

72
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
but let me flip over to something else you know about, and that's computers.

73
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Look at this screen here and, you know, you see pictures

74
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and you see words, but really all there are are ones and zeros.

75
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
The language of technology is binary;

76
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
you've probably heard that at some point in time.

77
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Everything that happens in digital is converted,

78
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
or a representation, of a one and a zero.

79
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So, when you're listening to iTunes and your favorite music,

80
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that's really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly.

81
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
When you're seeing these pictures, it's all ones and zeros,

82
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and when you're talking on your telephone, your cell phone,

83
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and it's going over the network,

84
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
your voice is all being turned into ones and zeros and magically whizzed around.

85
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And look at all the complex things and wonderful things

86
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
we've been able to create with just a one and a zero.

87
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Well, now you ramp that up to four, and you have a lot of complexity,

88
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
a lot of ways to describe mechanisms.

89
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So, let's talk about what that means.

90
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So, if you look at a human genome,

91
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
they consist of 3.2 billion of these base pairs. That's a lot.

92
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And they mix up in all different fashions,

93
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and that makes you a human being.

94
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
If you convert that to binary, just to give you a little bit of sizing,

95
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
we're actually smaller than the program Microsoft Office.

96
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It's not really all that much data.

97
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I will also tell you we're at least as buggy.

98
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Laughter)

99
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
This here is a bug in my genome

100
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that I have struggled with for a long, long time.

101
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
When you get sick, it is a bug in your genome.

102
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
In fact, many, many diseases we have struggled with for a long time,

103
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
like cancer, we haven't been able to cure

104
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
because we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level.

105
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
We are starting to understand that.

106
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So, up to this point we tried to fix it

107
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
by using what I call shit-against-the-wall pharmacology,

108
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
which means, well, let's just throw chemicals at it,

109
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and maybe it's going to make it work.

110
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But if you really understand why does a cell go from normal cell to cancer?

111
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
What is the code?

112
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
What are the exact instructions that are making it do that?

113
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out.

114
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So, for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine, here's a few factoids for you.

115
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
We actually have about 24,000 genes that do things.

116
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We have about a hundred, 120,000 others

117
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that don't appear to function every day,

118
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
but represent this archival history of how we used to work as a species

119
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
going back tens of thousands of years.

120
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
You might also be interested in knowing

121
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that a mouse has about the same amount of genes.

122
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
They recently sequenced Pinot Noir, and it also has about 30,000 genes,

123
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
so the number of genes you have may not necessarily represent the complexity

124
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
or the evolutionary order of any particular species.

125
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Now, look around: just look next to your neighbor,

126
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
look forward, look backward. We all look pretty different.

127
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
A lot of very handsome and pretty people here, skinny, chubby,

128
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
different races, cultures. We are all 99.9% genetically equal.

129
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
It is one one-hundredth of one percent of genetic material

130
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that makes the difference between any one of us.

131
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
That's a tiny amount of material,

132
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but the way that ultimately expresses itself

133
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
is what makes changes in humans and in all species.

134
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So, we are now able to read genomes.

135
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The first human genome took 10 years, three billion dollars.

136
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
It was done by Dr. Craig Venter.

137
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And then James Watson's -- one of the co-founders of DNA --

138
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
genome was done for two million dollars, and in just two months.

139
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And if you think about the computer industry

140
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and how we've gone from big computers to little ones

141
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and how they get more powerful and faster all the time,

142
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now:

143
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes

144
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
for about 5,000 dollars in about an hour or a half-hour;

145
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
you will see that happen in the next five years.

146
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And what that means is, you are going to walk around

147
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
with your own personal genome on a smart card. It will be here.

148
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And when you buy medicine,

149
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
you won't be buying a drug that's used for everybody.

150
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
You will give your genome to the pharmacist,

151
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and your drug will be made for you

152
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and it will work much better than the ones that were --

153
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
you won't have side effects.

154
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
All those side effects, you know, oily residue and, you know,

155
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
whatever they say in those commercials: forget about that.

156
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
They're going to make all that stuff go away.

157
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
What does a genome look like?

158
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Well, there it is. It is a long, long series of these base pairs.

159
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
If you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this,

160
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
but what scientists are doing now is

161
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
they're understanding what these do and what they mean.

162
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Because what Nature is doing is double-clicking all the time.

163
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
In other words, the first couple of sentences here,

164
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
assuming this is a grape plant:

165
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
make a root, make a branch, create a blossom.

166
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
In a human being, down in here it could be:

167
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
make blood cells, start cancer.

168
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
For me it may be: every calorie you consume, you conserve,

169
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
because I come from a very cold climate.

170
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
For my wife: eat three times as much and you never put on any weight.

171
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
It's all hidden in this code,

172
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace.

173
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So, what can we do with genomes now that we can read them,

174
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
now that we're starting to have the book of life?

175
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Well, there's many things. Some are exciting.

176
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Some people will find very scary. I will tell you a couple of things

177
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me, but that's okay.

178
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So, you know, we now can learn the history of organisms.

179
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
You can do a very simple test: scrape your cheek; send it off.

180
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
You can find out where your relatives come from;

181
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
you can do your genealogy going back thousands of years.

182
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
We can understand functionality. This is really important.

183
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
We can understand, for example, why we create plaque in our arteries,

184
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
what creates the starchiness inside of a grain,

185
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide.

186
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
We can also look at, at a grander scale, what creates problems,

187
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
what creates disease, and how we may be able to fix them.

188
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Because we can understand this,

189
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
we can fix them, make better organisms.

190
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Most importantly, what we're learning

191
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
is that Nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox.

192
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
The toolbox exists.

193
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
An architect far better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox,

194
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and we now have the ability to use it.

195
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
We are now not just reading genomes; we are writing them.

196
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
This company, Synthetic Genomics, I'm involved with,

197
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
created the first full synthetic genome for a little bug,

198
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
a very primitive creature called Mycoplasma genitalium.

199
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
If you have a UTI, you've probably -- or ever had a UTI --

200
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
you've come in contact with this little bug.

201
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Very simple -- only has about 246 genes --

202
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
but we were able to completely synthesize that genome.

203
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Now, you have the genome and you say to yourself,

204
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So, if I plug this synthetic genome -- if I pull the old one out and plug it in --

205
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
does it just boot up and live?

206
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Well, guess what. It does.

207
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Not only does it do that; if you took the genome -- that synthetic genome --

208
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and you plugged it into a different critter, like yeast,

209
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
you now turn that yeast into Mycoplasma.

210
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
It's, sort of, like booting up a PC with a Mac O.S. software.

211
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Well, actually, you could do it the other way.

212
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So, you know, by being able to write a genome

213
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and plug it into an organism,

214
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
the software, if you will, changes the hardware.

215
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And this is extremely profound.

216
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So, last year the French and Italians announced

217
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
they got together and they went ahead and they sequenced Pinot Noir.

218
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
The genomic sequence now exists for the entire Pinot Noir organism,

219
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and they identified, once again, about 29,000 genes.

220
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
They have discovered pathways that create flavors,

221
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
although it's very important to understand

222
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
that those compounds that it's cranking out

223
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
have to match a receptor in our genome, in our tongue,

224
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
for us to understand and interpret those flavors.

225
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
They've also discovered that

226
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
there's a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well.

227
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
They've identified areas of vulnerability to disease.

228
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
They now are understanding, and the work is going on,

229
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
exactly how this plant works, and we have the capability to know,

230
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
to read that entire code and understand how it ticks.

231
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
So, then what do you do?

232
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Knowing that we can read it, knowing that we can write it, change it,

233
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
maybe write its genome from scratch. So, what do you do?

234
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Well, one thing you could do is what some people might call Franken-Noir.

235
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
(Laughter)

236
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
We can build a better vine.

237
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
By the way, just so you know:

238
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
you get stressed out about genetically modified organisms;

239
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere

240
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
that is not genetically modified.

241
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
They're not grown from seeds; they're grafted into root stock;

242
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
they would not exist in nature on their own.

243
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
So, don't worry about, don't stress about that stuff. We've been doing this forever.

244
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
So, we could, you know, focus on disease resistance;

245
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
we can go for higher yields without necessarily having

246
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
dramatic farming techniques to do it, or costs.

247
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
We could conceivably expand the climate window:

248
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
we could make Pinot Noir grow maybe in Long Island, God forbid.

249
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
(Laughter)

250
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
We could produce better flavors and aromas.

251
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
You want a little more raspberry, a little more chocolate here or there?

252
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
All of these things could conceivably be done,

253
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and I will tell you I'd pretty much bet that it will be done.

254
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
But there's an ecosystem here.

255
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
In other words, we're not, sort of, unique little organisms running around;

256
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
we are part of a big ecosystem.

257
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
In fact -- I'm sorry to inform you --

258
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
that inside of your digestive tract is about 10 pounds of microbes

259
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
which you're circulating through your body quite a bit.

260
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Our ocean's teaming with microbes;

261
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
in fact, when Craig Venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean,

262
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet

263
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
by discovering all-new microbes in the first 20 feet of water.

264
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
We now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate

265
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and regulating CO2 and oxygen than plants do,

266
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere.

267
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
We find microbial life in every part of the planet:

268
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
in ice, in coal, in rocks, in volcanic vents; it's an amazing thing.

269
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
But we've also discovered, when it comes to plants, in plants,

270
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
as much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes,

271
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
it is the ecosystem around them,

272
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
it is the microbes that live in their root systems,

273
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
that have just as much impact on the character of those plants

274
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
as the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves.

275
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
If you take a closer look at a root system,

276
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:01,000
you will find there are many, many, many diverse microbial colonies.

277
0:17:01.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
This is not big news to viticulturists;

278
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
they have been, you know, concerned with water and fertilization.

279
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
And, again, this is, sort of, my notion of shit-against-the-wall pharmacology:

280
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in.

281
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
You don't necessarily know with granularity

282
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
exactly what organisms are providing what flavors and what characteristics.

283
0:17:27.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
We can start to figure that out.

284
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:33,000
We all talk about terroir; we worship terroir;

285
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
we say, Wow, is my terroir great! It's so special.

286
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
I've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn't believe.

287
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Well, you know, we really, we argue and debate about it --

288
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
we say it's climate, it's soil, it's this. Well, guess what?

289
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
We can figure out what the heck terroir is.

290
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:53,000
It's in there, waiting to be sequenced.

291
0:17:53.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
There are thousands of microbes there.

292
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
They're easy to sequence: unlike a human,

293
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:17:59,000
they, you know, have a thousand, two thousand genes;

294
0:17:59.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
we can figure out what they are.

295
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:08,000
All we have to do is go around and sample, dig into the ground, find those bugs,

296
0:18:08.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
sequence them, correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don't like --

297
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:16,000
that's just a big database -- and then fertilize.

298
0:18:16.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
And then we understand what is terroir.

299
0:18:20.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
So, some people will say, Oh, my God, are we playing God?

300
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
Are we now, if we engineer organisms, are we playing God?

301
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:3,000
And, you know, people would always ask James Watson --

302
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:32,000
he's not always the most politically correct guy ...

303
0:18:32.16,000 --> 0:18:33,000
(Laughter)

304
0:18:33.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
... and they would say, "Are, you know, are you playing God?"

305
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
And he had the best answer I ever heard to this question:

306
0:18:41.16,000 --> 0:18:43,000
"Well, somebody has to."

307
0:18:43.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
(Laughter)

308
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:5,000
I consider myself a very spiritual person,

309
0:18:50.16,000 --> 0:18:53,000
and without, you know, the organized religion part,

310
0:18:53.16,000 --> 0:18:57,000
and I will tell you: I don't believe there's anything unnatural.

311
0:18:57.16,000 --> 0:19:01,000
I don't believe that chemicals are unnatural.

312
0:19:01.16,000 --> 0:19:03,000
I told you I'm going to make some of you puke.

313
0:19:03.16,000 --> 0:19:07,000
It's very simple: we don't invent molecules, compounds.

314
0:19:07.16,000 --> 0:19:09,000
They're here. They're in the universe.

315
0:19:09.16,000 --> 0:19:12,000
We reorganize things, we change them around,

316
0:19:12.16,000 --> 0:19:15,000
but we don't make anything unnatural.

317
0:19:15.16,000 --> 0:19:17,000
Now, we can create bad impacts --

318
0:19:17.16,000 --> 0:19:19,000
we can poison ourselves; we can poison the Earth --

319
0:19:19.16,000 --> 0:19:23,000
but that's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made.

320
0:19:23.16,000 --> 0:19:27,000
So, what's happening today is, Nature is presenting us with a toolbox,

321
0:19:27.16,000 --> 0:19:31,000
and we find that this toolbox is very extensive.

322
0:19:31.16,000 --> 0:19:35,000
There are microbes out there that actually make gasoline, believe it or not.

323
0:19:35.16,000 --> 0:19:37,000
There are microbes, you know -- go back to yeast.

324
0:19:37.16,000 --> 0:19:39,000
These are chemical factories;

325
0:19:39.16,000 --> 0:19:43,000
the most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by Nature,

326
0:19:43.16,000 --> 0:19:46,000
and we now can use those.

327
0:19:46.16,000 --> 0:19:48,000
There also is a set of rules.

328
0:19:48.16,000 --> 0:19:51,000
Nature will not allow you to --

329
0:19:51.16,000 --> 0:19:53,000
we could engineer a grape plant, but guess what.

330
0:19:53.16,000 --> 0:19:55,000
We can't make the grape plant produce babies.

331
0:19:55.16,000 --> 0:19:58,000
Nature has put a set of rules out there.

332
0:19:58.16,000 --> 0:20:01,000
We can work within the rules; we can't break the rules;

333
0:20:01.16,000 --> 0:20:03,000
we're just learning what the rules are.

334
0:20:03.16,000 --> 0:20:07,000
I just ask the question, if you could cure all disease --

335
0:20:07.16,000 --> 0:20:09,000
if you could make disease go away,

336
0:20:09.16,000 --> 0:20:11,000
because we understand how it actually works,

337
0:20:11.16,000 --> 0:20:16,000
if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious, healthy plants

338
0:20:16.16,000 --> 0:20:19,000
that grow in very hard-to-grow environments,

339
0:20:19.16,000 --> 0:20:22,000
if we could create clean and plentiful energy --

340
0:20:22.16,000 --> 0:20:25,000
we, right in the labs at Synthetic Genomics,

341
0:20:25.16,000 --> 0:20:29,000
have single-celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide

342
0:20:29.16,000 --> 0:20:33,000
and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline.

343
0:20:33.16,000 --> 0:20:38,000
So, carbon dioxide -- the stuff we want to get rid of -- not sugar, not anything.

344
0:20:38.16,000 --> 0:20:41,000
Carbon dioxide, a little bit of sunlight,

345
0:20:41.16,000 --> 0:20:46,000
you end up with a lipid that is highly refined.

346
0:20:46.16,000 --> 0:20:5,000
We could solve our energy problems; we can reduce CO2,;

347
0:20:50.16,000 --> 0:20:53,000
we could clean up our oceans; we could make better wine.

348
0:20:53.16,000 --> 0:20:56,000
If we could, would we?

349
0:20:56.16,000 --> 0:20:59,000
Well, you know, I think the answer is very simple:

350
0:20:59.16,000 --> 0:21:04,000
working with Nature, working with this tool set that we now understand,

351
0:21:04.16,000 --> 0:21:07,000
is the next step in humankind's evolution.

352
0:21:07.16,000 --> 0:21:11,000
And all I can tell you is, stay healthy for 20 years.

353
0:21:11.16,000 --> 0:21:14,000
If you can stay healthy for 20 years, you'll see 150, maybe 300.

354
0:21:14.16,000 --> 0:21:16,000
Thank you.

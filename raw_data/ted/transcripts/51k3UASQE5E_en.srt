1
0:00:13.52,000 --> 0:00:15,000
How many of us have ever seen something,

2
0:00:16.32,000 --> 0:00:18,000
thought that we should report it, but decided not to?

3
0:00:21.12,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And not that I need to see a show of hands,

4
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but I'm sure this has happened to someone in this room before.

5
0:00:26.24,000 --> 0:00:29,000
In fact, when this question was asked to a group of employees,

6
0:00:29.44,000 --> 0:00:32,000
46 percent of them responded by saying that they had seen something

7
0:00:32.96,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and decided not to report it.

8
0:00:34.6,000 --> 0:00:37,000
So if you raised your hand, or quietly raised your hand,

9
0:00:37.76,000 --> 0:00:39,000
don't feel bad, you're not alone.

10
0:00:40.08,000 --> 0:00:43,000
This message of if you see something to say something

11
0:00:43.48,000 --> 0:00:44,000
is really all around us.

12
0:00:45.28,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Even when driving down the highway, you see billboards like this,

13
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:52,000
encouraging us to report crime without revealing ourselves.

14
0:00:52.48,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But I still feel like a lot of us are really uncomfortable

15
0:00:55.24,000 --> 0:00:57,000
coming forward in the name of the truth.

16
0:00:57.44,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I'm an accounting professor, and I do fraud research.

17
0:01:00.04,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And in my class, I encourage my students to come forward with information

18
0:01:04.24,000 --> 0:01:05,000
if they see it.

19
0:01:05.48,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Or in other words, encouraging my students to become whistle-blowers.

20
0:01:09.24,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But if I'm being completely honest with myself,

21
0:01:12.32,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I am really conflicted with this message that I'm sending to my students.

22
0:01:15.96,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And here's why.

23
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Whistle-blowers are under attack.

24
0:01:21.56,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Headline after headline shows us this.

25
0:01:25.96,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Many people choose not to become whistle-blowers

26
0:01:28.36,000 --> 0:01:3,000
due to the fear of retaliation.

27
0:01:30.64,000 --> 0:01:33,000
From demotions to death threats,

28
0:01:34.36,000 --> 0:01:35,000
to job loss --

29
0:01:36.28,000 --> 0:01:37,000
perpetual job loss.

30
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Choosing to become a whistle-blower is an uphill battle.

31
0:01:41.56,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Their loyalty becomes into question.

32
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Their motives, their trustworthiness.

33
0:01:47.24,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So how can I, as a professor who really cares about her students

34
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:53,000
encourage them to become whistle-blowers,

35
0:01:53.12,000 --> 0:01:55,000
when I know how the world truly feels about them?

36
0:01:56.72,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So, one day I was getting ready for my annual whistle-blower lecture

37
0:01:59.96,000 --> 0:02:,000
with my students.

38
0:02:01.2,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And I was working on an article for "Forbes,"

39
0:02:03.36,000 --> 0:02:05,000
entitled "Wells Fargo and Millennial Whistle-blowing.

40
0:02:05.88,000 --> 0:02:06,000
What Do We Tell Them?"

41
0:02:07.12,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And as I was working on this piece and reading about the case,

42
0:02:10.2,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I became outraged.

43
0:02:11.6,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And what made me angry was when I came to the fact and realized

44
0:02:15.76,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that the employees that tried to whistle-blow

45
0:02:18.44,000 --> 0:02:19,000
were actually fired.

46
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And it really made me think

47
0:02:21.52,000 --> 0:02:23,000
about the message that I was sharing with my students.

48
0:02:24.28,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And it made me think: What if my students had been Wells Fargo employees?

49
0:02:29.12,000 --> 0:02:33,000
On the one hand, if they whistle-blew, they would have gotten fired.

50
0:02:33.28,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But on the other hand,

51
0:02:34.64,000 --> 0:02:36,000
if they didn't report the frauds that they knew,

52
0:02:37.36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
the way current regulation is written,

53
0:02:39.72,000 --> 0:02:41,000
employees are held responsible

54
0:02:42.32,000 --> 0:02:44,000
if they knew something and didn't report it.

55
0:02:44.64,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So criminal prosecution is a real option.

56
0:02:47.64,000 --> 0:02:5,000
What's a person supposed to do with those type of odds?

57
0:02:50.84,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I of all people know the valuable contributions

58
0:02:54.8,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that whistle-blowers make.

59
0:02:56.36,000 --> 0:02:59,000
In fact, most frauds are discovered by them.

60
0:02:59.92,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Forty two percent of frauds are discovered by a whistle-blower

61
0:03:02.88,000 --> 0:03:03,000
in comparison to other methods,

62
0:03:04.76,000 --> 0:03:06,000
like measurement review and external audit.

63
0:03:07.36,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And when you think about some of the more classic

64
0:03:09.72,000 --> 0:03:1,000
or historical fraud cases,

65
0:03:11.36,000 --> 0:03:13,000
it always is around a whistle-blower.

66
0:03:14.12,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Think Watergate -- discovered by a whistle-blower.

67
0:03:16.88,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Think Enron -- discovered by a whistle-blower.

68
0:03:19.8,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And who can forget about Bernard Madoff, discovered by a whistle-blower?

69
0:03:24.4,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It takes a tremendous amount of courage to come forward in the name of the truth.

70
0:03:28.88,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But when we think about the term whistle-blower,

71
0:03:31.6,000 --> 0:03:34,000
we often think of some very descriptive words:

72
0:03:35.28,000 --> 0:03:36,000
rat,

73
0:03:37.36,000 --> 0:03:38,000
snake,

74
0:03:39.2,000 --> 0:03:4,000
traitor,

75
0:03:40.84,000 --> 0:03:42,000
tattletale, weasel.

76
0:03:43.24,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And those are the nice words, the ones I can say from the stage.

77
0:03:46.84,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And so when I'm not in class,

78
0:03:48.28,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I go around the country and I interview white-collar felons,

79
0:03:51.2,000 --> 0:03:53,000
whistle-blowers and victims of fraud.

80
0:03:53.24,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Because really I'm trying to understand what makes them tick

81
0:03:56.2,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and to bring those experiences back into the classroom.

82
0:03:59.68,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But it's my interviews with whistle-blowers that really stick with me.

83
0:04:03.56,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And they stick with me,

84
0:04:04.8,000 --> 0:04:06,000
because they make me question my own courage.

85
0:04:07.12,000 --> 0:04:1,000
When given the opportunity, would I actually speak up?

86
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And so, this is a couple stories that I want to share with you.

87
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:15,000
This is Mary.

88
0:04:15.24,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Mary Willingham is the whistle-blower from the University of North Carolina

89
0:04:18.96,000 --> 0:04:21,000
at Chapel Hill, academic fraud case.

90
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And Mary was a learning specialist at the university,

91
0:04:25.64,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and she worked with students, primarily student athletes.

92
0:04:28.68,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And what she noticed, when she was working with students,

93
0:04:31.399,000 --> 0:04:33,000
is they were turning in term papers

94
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that seemed well beyond their reading levels.

95
0:04:37.28,000 --> 0:04:38,000
She started to ask a couple of questions

96
0:04:39.24,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and she found out that there was a database

97
0:04:41.28,000 --> 0:04:44,000
where the student athletes could retrieve papers and turn them in.

98
0:04:44.68,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And then she found out that some of her colleagues

99
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
were funneling students into fake classes, just to keep them eligible to play.

100
0:04:53.4,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Now, when Mary found this out, she was outraged.

101
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And so what she tried to do was go to her direct supervisor.

102
0:04:59.12,000 --> 0:05:,000
But they didn't do anything.

103
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And then Mary tried to go to some internal university administrators.

104
0:05:04.84,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And they didn't do anything.

105
0:05:06.48,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So, what happens when nobody listens?

106
0:05:08.88,000 --> 0:05:09,000
You blog.

107
0:05:10.12,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So Mary decided to develop a blog.

108
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Her blog went viral within 24 hours,

109
0:05:14.68,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and she was contacted by a reporter.

110
0:05:17.2,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Now, when she was contacted by this reporter,

111
0:05:19.52,000 --> 0:05:2,000
her identity was known.

112
0:05:21.32,000 --> 0:05:22,000
She was exposed.

113
0:05:22.68,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And when she was exposed, she received a demotion,

114
0:05:26.52,000 --> 0:05:29,000
death threats, over collegiate sports.

115
0:05:30.28,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Mary didn't do anything wrong. She didn't participate in the fraud.

116
0:05:34.12,000 --> 0:05:36,000
She really thought that she was giving voice

117
0:05:36.36,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to students that were voiceless.

118
0:05:38.68,000 --> 0:05:4,000
But her loyalty was questioned.

119
0:05:41.08,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Her trustworthiness and her motives.

120
0:05:45.48,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Now, whistle-blowing doesn't always have to end

121
0:05:48.88,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in demotions or death threats.

122
0:05:50.6,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Actually, in 2002, this was the cover of "Time" magazine,

123
0:05:54.56,000 --> 0:05:57,000
where we were actually honoring three brave whistle-blowers

124
0:05:57.92,000 --> 0:05:59,000
for their decision to come forward in the name of the truth.

125
0:06:00.88,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And when you look at the research,

126
0:06:02.56,000 --> 0:06:05,000
22 percent of whistle-blowers actually report retaliation.

127
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So there is a huge population of people that report and are not retaliated against

128
0:06:11.64,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and that gives me hope.

129
0:06:14.28,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So this is Kathe.

130
0:06:15.96,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Kathe Swanson is a retired city clerk from the city of Dixon.

131
0:06:20.4,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And one day, Kathe was doing her job, just like she always did,

132
0:06:24.08,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and she stumbled upon a pretty interesting case.

133
0:06:27.84,000 --> 0:06:28,000
See, Kathe was at the end of the month,

134
0:06:29.72,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and she was doing her treasures report for the city,

135
0:06:32.52,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and typically, her boss, Rita Crundwell, gave her a list of accounts and said,

136
0:06:36.6,000 --> 0:06:38,000
"Kathe, call the bank and get these specific accounts."

137
0:06:39.6,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And Kathe did her job.

138
0:06:41.28,000 --> 0:06:42,000
But this particular day,

139
0:06:42.68,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Rita was out of town, and Kathe was busy.

140
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
She picks up the phone, she calls the bank and says, "Fax me all of the accounts."

141
0:06:50.36,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And when she gets the fax, she sees that there is an account

142
0:06:53.68,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that has some withdrawals and deposits in it

143
0:06:55.84,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that she did not know about.

144
0:06:57.32,000 --> 0:07:,000
It was an account controlled only by Rita.

145
0:07:00.64,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So Kathe looked at the information, she reported it to her direct supervisor,

146
0:07:04.64,000 --> 0:07:06,000
which was then-mayor Burke,

147
0:07:06.8,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and this led into a huge investigation, a six-month investigation.

148
0:07:11.2,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Come to find out, Kathe's boss, Rita Crundwell, was embezzling money.

149
0:07:16.24,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Rita was embezzling 53 million dollars over a 20-year period,

150
0:07:21.48,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and Kathe just happened to stumble upon it.

151
0:07:25.08,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Kathe is a hero.

152
0:07:28.04,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And actually, I had the opportunity

153
0:07:29.76,000 --> 0:07:32,000
of interviewing Kathe for my documentary, "All the Queen's Horses."

154
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And Kathe wasn't seeking fame.

155
0:07:35.52,000 --> 0:07:38,000
In fact, she really didn't want to talk to me for a really long time,

156
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:42,000
but through strategic stalking, she ended up doing the interview.

157
0:07:42.12,000 --> 0:07:43,000
(Laughter)

158
0:07:43.28,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But she was seeking fairness, not fame.

159
0:07:45.52,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And if it wasn't for Kathe,

160
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
who's to say this fraud would have ever been discovered?

161
0:07:51.12,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So, remember that "Forbes" article I was talking about,

162
0:07:53.76,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that I was working on before my lecture?

163
0:07:55.689,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Well, I posted it and something really fantastic happened.

164
0:07:59.28,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I started receiving emails from whistle-blowers all over the world.

165
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And as I was receiving these emails and responding back to them,

166
0:08:07.6,000 --> 0:08:09,000
there was a common theme in the message that I received,

167
0:08:10.28,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and this is what it was:

168
0:08:11.52,000 --> 0:08:15,000
they all said this, "I blew the whistle, people really hate me now.

169
0:08:15.92,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I got fired, but guess what?

170
0:08:18.12,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I would do it all over again if I could."

171
0:08:21.52,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And so as I kept reading this message, all these messages,

172
0:08:24.76,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I wanted to think, what could I share with my students?

173
0:08:27.6,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And so, I pulled it all together and this is what I learned.

174
0:08:31.2,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It's important for us to cultivate hope.

175
0:08:34.32,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Whistle-blowers are hopeful.

176
0:08:36.28,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Despite popular belief,

177
0:08:37.72,000 --> 0:08:41,000
they're not all disgruntled employees that have a beef with the company.

178
0:08:42.04,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Their hopefulness really is what drives them to come forward.

179
0:08:46.24,000 --> 0:08:48,000
We also have to cultivate commitment.

180
0:08:48.679,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Whistle-blowers are committed.

181
0:08:50.559,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And it's that passion to their organization

182
0:08:53.08,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that makes them want to come forward.

183
0:08:55.52,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Whistle-blowers are humble.

184
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Again, they're not seeking fame, but they are seeking fairness.

185
0:09:01.24,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And we need to continue to cultivate bravery.

186
0:09:04.12,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Whistle-blowers are brave.

187
0:09:05.72,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Often, they underestimated

188
0:09:09.44,000 --> 0:09:11,000
the impact whistle-blowing had on their family,

189
0:09:12.08,000 --> 0:09:16,000
but what they continue to comment on is how hard it is to withhold the truth.

190
0:09:17.96,000 --> 0:09:19,000
With that, I want to leave you with one additional name:

191
0:09:20.8,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Peter Buxtun.

192
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Peter Buxtun was a 27-year-old employee for the US Public Health Service.

193
0:09:29.36,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And he was hired to interview people

194
0:09:33.32,000 --> 0:09:35,000
that had sexually transmitted diseases.

195
0:09:35.72,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And through the course of his work,

196
0:09:37.8,000 --> 0:09:4,000
he noticed a clinical study that was going on within the organization.

197
0:09:41.76,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And it was a study that was looking at the progression of untreated syphilis.

198
0:09:45.88,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And so, there were 600 African American males

199
0:09:48.68,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that were in this study.

200
0:09:49.92,000 --> 0:09:5,000
They were enticed into the study

201
0:09:51.52,000 --> 0:09:54,000
through being given free medical exams, burial insurance.

202
0:09:55.48,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And so, what happened through the course of this study,

203
0:09:59.2,000 --> 0:10:03,000
is penicillin was discovered to help treat syphilis.

204
0:10:04.12,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And what Peter noticed was,

205
0:10:06.08,000 --> 0:10:09,000
the participants in this study were not given the penicillin

206
0:10:10.04,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to treat their syphilis.

207
0:10:11.56,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And the participants didn't know.

208
0:10:13.4,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So similar to Mary, Peter tried to report and talk to his internal supervisors,

209
0:10:18.6,000 --> 0:10:19,000
but no one listened.

210
0:10:20.36,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And so Peter thought this was completely unfair

211
0:10:22.8,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and he tried to report again,

212
0:10:24.4,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and finally talked to a reporter -- very similar to Mary.

213
0:10:28.08,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And in 1972, this was the front page of the "New York Times":

214
0:10:32.4,000 --> 0:10:36,000
"Syphilis Victims in US Study Went Untreated for 40 Years."

215
0:10:37.64,000 --> 0:10:41,000
This is known to us today as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment.

216
0:10:42.08,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And Peter was the whistle-blower.

217
0:10:44.32,000 --> 0:10:48,000
What happened to the 600 men, you may wonder, the 600 original men?

218
0:10:48.4,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Twenty eight men died from syphilis.

219
0:10:51.4,000 --> 0:10:54,000
One hundred died from syphilis complications,

220
0:10:54.56,000 --> 0:10:55,000
forty wives were infected

221
0:10:56.44,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and 10 children were born with congenital syphilis.

222
0:10:59.32,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Who's to say what these numbers would be

223
0:11:01.68,000 --> 0:11:05,000
if it wasn't for the brave, courageous act of Peter?

224
0:11:05.8,000 --> 0:11:07,000
We're all connected to Peter, actually.

225
0:11:08.32,000 --> 0:11:1,000
If you know anybody that's in a clinical trial,

226
0:11:10.92,000 --> 0:11:13,000
the reason why we have informed consent today

227
0:11:14.12,000 --> 0:11:16,000
is because of Peter's courageous act.

228
0:11:17.4,000 --> 0:11:18,000
So let me ask you a question.

229
0:11:18.84,000 --> 0:11:2,000
That original question, a variation of the original question.

230
0:11:21.76,000 --> 0:11:24,000
How many of us have ever used the term

231
0:11:24.88,000 --> 0:11:26,000
snitch, rat

232
0:11:27.88,000 --> 0:11:28,000
tattletale,

233
0:11:29.48,000 --> 0:11:3,000
snake,

234
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
weasel,

235
0:11:32.68,000 --> 0:11:33,000
leak?

236
0:11:34.92,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Anybody?

237
0:11:39.64,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Before you get the urge to do that again,

238
0:11:42.72,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I want you to think a little bit.

239
0:11:44.56,000 --> 0:11:47,000
It might be the Mary, the Peter, the Kathes of the world.

240
0:11:49.48,000 --> 0:11:51,000
You might be the person that could shape history,

241
0:11:52.44,000 --> 0:11:54,000
or they could be the person that shapes yours.

242
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Thank you.

243
0:11:56.24,000 --> 0:11:59,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.952,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So this is the first time I've told this story in public,

2
0:00:15.882,000 --> 0:00:16,000
the personal aspects of it.

3
0:00:19.056,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Yogi Berra was a world-famous baseball player who said,

4
0:00:24.157,000 --> 0:00:26,000
"If you come to a fork in the road, take it."

5
0:00:27.069,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Researchers had been, for more than a century,

6
0:00:30.592,000 --> 0:00:32,000
studying the immune system as a way to fight cancer,

7
0:00:34.482,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and cancer vaccines have, unfortunately, been disappointing.

8
0:00:37.966,000 --> 0:00:39,000
They've only worked in cancers caused by viruses,

9
0:00:40.8,000 --> 0:00:43,000
like cervical cancer or liver cancer.

10
0:00:45.129,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So cancer researchers basically gave up on the idea

11
0:00:47.963,000 --> 0:00:49,000
of using the immune system to fight cancer.

12
0:00:52.127,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And the immune system, in any case, did not evolve to fight cancer;

13
0:00:56.147,000 --> 0:00:59,000
it evolved to fight pathogens invading from the outside.

14
0:00:59.962,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So its job is to kill bacteria and viruses.

15
0:01:03.479,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And the reason the immune system has trouble with most cancers

16
0:01:06.847,000 --> 0:01:09,000
is that it doesn't invade from the outside;

17
0:01:10.315,000 --> 0:01:13,000
it evolves from its own cells.

18
0:01:14.337,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And so either the immune system does not recognize the cancer as a problem,

19
0:01:18.568,000 --> 0:01:21,000
or it attacks a cancer and also our normal cells,

20
0:01:21.877,000 --> 0:01:25,000
leading to autoimmune diseases like colitis or multiple sclerosis.

21
0:01:26.991,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So how do you get around that?

22
0:01:28.814,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Our answer turned out to be synthetic immune systems

23
0:01:33.672,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that are designed to recognize and kill cancer cells.

24
0:01:37.609,000 --> 0:01:4,000
That's right -- I said a synthetic immune system.

25
0:01:42.978,000 --> 0:01:46,000
You do that with genetic engineering and synthetic biology.

26
0:01:47.78,000 --> 0:01:5,000
We did it with the naturally occurring parts of the immune system,

27
0:01:50.956,000 --> 0:01:51,000
called B cells and T cells.

28
0:01:52.91,000 --> 0:01:54,000
These were our building blocks.

29
0:01:55.522,000 --> 0:01:58,000
T cells have evolved to kill cells infected with viruses,

30
0:01:59.22,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and B cells are the cells that make antibodies that are secreted

31
0:02:03.383,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and then bind to kill bacteria.

32
0:02:07.012,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Well, what if you combined these two functions

33
0:02:11.379,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in a way that was designed to repurpose them to fight cancer?

34
0:02:15.474,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We realized it would be possible to insert the genes for antibodies

35
0:02:19.125,000 --> 0:02:21,000
from B cells into T cells.

36
0:02:21.854,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So how do you do that?

37
0:02:24.109,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Well, we used an HIV virus as a Trojan horse

38
0:02:28.179,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to get past the T cells' immune system.

39
0:02:32.464,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The result is a chimera,

40
0:02:34.075,000 --> 0:02:38,000
a fantastic fire-breathing creature from Greek mythology,

41
0:02:38.212,000 --> 0:02:41,000
with a lion's head, a goat's body and a serpent's tail.

42
0:02:42.72,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So we decided that the paradoxical thing that we had created

43
0:02:46.403,000 --> 0:02:5,000
with our B-cell antibodies, our T cells carrier

44
0:02:50.62,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and the HIV Trojan horse

45
0:02:52.712,000 --> 0:02:56,000
should be called "Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells," or CAR T cells.

46
0:02:58.538,000 --> 0:03:,000
The virus also inserts genetic information

47
0:03:01.545,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to activate the T cells and program them into their killing mode.

48
0:03:05.915,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So when CAR T cells are injected into somebody with cancer,

49
0:03:10.018,000 --> 0:03:14,000
what happens when those CAR T cells see and bind to their tumor target?

50
0:03:14.688,000 --> 0:03:17,000
They act like supercharged killer T cells on steroids.

51
0:03:19.197,000 --> 0:03:22,000
They start this crash-defense buildup system in the body

52
0:03:22.617,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and literally divide and multiply by the millions,

53
0:03:25.701,000 --> 0:03:27,000
where they then attack and kill the tumor.

54
0:03:28.55,000 --> 0:03:33,000
All of this means that CAR T cells are the first living drug in medicine.

55
0:03:34.375,000 --> 0:03:35,000
CAR T cells break the mold.

56
0:03:35.863,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Unlike normal drugs that you take --

57
0:03:38.141,000 --> 0:03:42,000
they do their job and get metabolized, and then you have to take them again --

58
0:03:42.339,000 --> 0:03:45,000
CAR T cells stay alive and on the job for years.

59
0:03:46.53,000 --> 0:03:5,000
We have had CAR T cells stay in the bodies of our cancer patients

60
0:03:51.113,000 --> 0:03:52,000
now for more than eight years.

61
0:03:54.196,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And these designer cancer T cells, CAR T cells,

62
0:03:57.458,000 --> 0:04:,000
have a calculated half-life of more than 17 years.

63
0:04:01.45,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So one infusion can do the job;

64
0:04:03.422,000 --> 0:04:05,000
they stay on patrol for the rest of your life.

65
0:04:06.403,000 --> 0:04:08,000
This is the beginning of a new paradigm in medicine.

66
0:04:10.173,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Now, there was one major challenge to these T-cell infusions.

67
0:04:15.903,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The only source of T cells that will work in a patient

68
0:04:20.194,000 --> 0:04:21,000
are your own T cells,

69
0:04:21.385,000 --> 0:04:23,000
unless you happen to have an identical twin.

70
0:04:24.234,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So for most of us, we're out of luck.

71
0:04:28.44,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So what we did was to make CAR T cells.

72
0:04:32.309,000 --> 0:04:35,000
We had to learn to grow the patient's own T cells.

73
0:04:35.381,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And we developed a robust platform for this in the 1990s.

74
0:04:39.831,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Then in 1997, we first tested CAR T cells in patients

75
0:04:43.887,000 --> 0:04:44,000
with advanced HIV-AIDS.

76
0:04:46.268,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And we found that those CAR T cells survived in the patients

77
0:04:49.39,000 --> 0:04:5,000
for more than a decade.

78
0:04:50.998,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And it improved their immune system and decreased their viruses,

79
0:04:54.037,000 --> 0:04:55,000
but it didn't cure them.

80
0:04:55.427,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So we went back to the laboratory, and over the next decade

81
0:04:58.292,000 --> 0:05:,000
made improvements to the CAR T cell design.

82
0:05:01.173,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And by 2010, we began treating leukemia patients.

83
0:05:05.663,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And our team treated three patients

84
0:05:08.044,000 --> 0:05:11,000
with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 2012.

85
0:05:11.806,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It's a form of incurable leukemia

86
0:05:14.498,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that afflicts approximately 20,000 adults every year in the United States.

87
0:05:19.887,000 --> 0:05:24,000
The first patient that we treated was a retired Marine sergeant

88
0:05:24.945,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and a prison corrections officer.

89
0:05:26.895,000 --> 0:05:27,000
He had only weeks to live

90
0:05:28.228,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and had, in fact, already paid for his funeral.

91
0:05:33.45,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The cells were infused, and within days, he had high fevers.

92
0:05:37.621,000 --> 0:05:38,000
He developed multiple organ failures,

93
0:05:39.422,000 --> 0:05:41,000
was transferred to the ICU and was comatose.

94
0:05:41.795,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We thought he would die,

95
0:05:43.383,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and, in fact, he was given last rites.

96
0:05:45.859,000 --> 0:05:49,000
But then, another fork in the road happened.

97
0:05:50.722,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So, around 28 days after the CAR T cell infusion,

98
0:05:53.73,000 --> 0:05:54,000
he woke up,

99
0:05:54.911,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and the physicians finally examined him,

100
0:05:57.189,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and the cancer was gone.

101
0:05:58.481,000 --> 0:06:,000
The big masses that had been there had melted.

102
0:06:01.823,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Bone marrow biopsies found no evidence of leukemia,

103
0:06:04.244,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and that year, in our first three patients we treated,

104
0:06:07.268,000 --> 0:06:1,000
two of three have had durable remissions now for eight years,

105
0:06:10.548,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and one had a partial remission.

106
0:06:13.23,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The CAR T cells had attacked the leukemia in these patients

107
0:06:16.554,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and had dissolved between 2.9 and 7.7 pounds of tumor in each patient.

108
0:06:24.649,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Their bodies had become veritable bioreactors for these CAR T cells,

109
0:06:29.506,000 --> 0:06:31,000
producing millions and millions of CAR T cells

110
0:06:32.387,000 --> 0:06:35,000
in the bone marrow, blood and tumor masses.

111
0:06:36.511,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And we discovered that these CAR T cells can punch far above their weight class,

112
0:06:40.82,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to use a boxing analogy.

113
0:06:42.718,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Just one CAR T cell can kill 1,000 tumor cells.

114
0:06:47.697,000 --> 0:06:49,000
That's right -- it's a ratio of one to a thousand.

115
0:06:50.623,000 --> 0:06:53,000
The CAR T cell and its daughter progeny cells

116
0:06:53.665,000 --> 0:06:55,000
can divide and divide and divide in the body

117
0:06:56.125,000 --> 0:06:58,000
until the last tumor cell is gone.

118
0:06:58.284,000 --> 0:07:,000
There's no precedent for this in cancer medicine.

119
0:07:01.379,000 --> 0:07:04,000
The first two patients who had full remission

120
0:07:04.583,000 --> 0:07:07,000
remain today leukemia-free,

121
0:07:07.683,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and we think they are cured.

122
0:07:09.297,000 --> 0:07:11,000
These are people who had run out of options,

123
0:07:13.106,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and by all traditional methods they had,

124
0:07:15.807,000 --> 0:07:17,000
they were like modern-day Lazarus cases.

125
0:07:18.87,000 --> 0:07:21,000
All I can say is: thank goodness for those forks in the road.

126
0:07:23.196,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Our next step was to get permission to treat children with acute leukemia,

127
0:07:27.73,000 --> 0:07:29,000
the most common form of cancer in kids.

128
0:07:30.419,000 --> 0:07:33,000
The first patient we enrolled on the trial was Emily Whitehead,

129
0:07:33.466,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and at that time, she was six years old.

130
0:07:35.538,000 --> 0:07:37,000
She had gone through a series of chemotherapy

131
0:07:38.188,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and radiation treatments over several years,

132
0:07:40.752,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and her leukemia had always come back.

133
0:07:42.626,000 --> 0:07:44,000
In fact, it had come back three times.

134
0:07:45.276,000 --> 0:07:47,000
When we first saw her, Emily was very ill.

135
0:07:51.244,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Her official diagnosis was advanced, incurable leukemia.

136
0:07:55.822,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Cancer had invaded her bone marrow, her liver, her spleen.

137
0:08:00.179,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And when we infused her with the CAR T cells

138
0:08:03.027,000 --> 0:08:05,000
in the spring of April 2012,

139
0:08:05.693,000 --> 0:08:07,000
over the next few days, she did not get better.

140
0:08:08.55,000 --> 0:08:1,000
She got worse, and in fact, much worse.

141
0:08:11.367,000 --> 0:08:14,000
As our prison corrections officer had in 2010,

142
0:08:14.613,000 --> 0:08:16,000
she, in 2012, was admitted to the ICU,

143
0:08:17.623,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and this was the scariest fork in the whole road of this story.

144
0:08:21.559,000 --> 0:08:24,000
By day three, she was comatose and on life support

145
0:08:26.522,000 --> 0:08:29,000
for kidney failure, lung failure and coma.

146
0:08:30.263,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Her fever was as high as 106 degrees Fahrenheit for three days.

147
0:08:35.239,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And we didn't know what was causing those fevers.

148
0:08:38.73,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We did all the standard blood tests for infections,

149
0:08:41.149,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and we could not find an infectious cause for her fever.

150
0:08:44.703,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But we did find something very unusual in her blood

151
0:08:48.664,000 --> 0:08:5,000
that had never been seen before in medicine.

152
0:08:51.374,000 --> 0:08:56,000
She had elevated levels of a protein called interleukin-6, or IL-6,

153
0:08:56.742,000 --> 0:08:57,000
in her blood.

154
0:08:57.934,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It was, in fact, more than a thousandfold above the normal levels.

155
0:09:03.45,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And here's where yet another fork in the road came in.

156
0:09:08.548,000 --> 0:09:09,000
By sheer coincidence,

157
0:09:10.199,000 --> 0:09:14,000
one of my daughters has a form of pediatric arthritis.

158
0:09:16.505,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And as a result, I had been following as a cancer doc,

159
0:09:19.728,000 --> 0:09:22,000
experimental therapies for arthritis for my daughter,

160
0:09:23.553,000 --> 0:09:24,000
in case she would need them.

161
0:09:24.95,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And it so happened that just months before Emily was admitted to the hospital,

162
0:09:29.197,000 --> 0:09:31,000
a new therapy had been approved by the FDA

163
0:09:32.137,000 --> 0:09:34,000
to treat elevated levels of interleukin-6.

164
0:09:34.871,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And it was approved for the arthritis that my daughter had.

165
0:09:37.665,000 --> 0:09:38,000
It's called tocilizumab.

166
0:09:40.584,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And, in fact, it had just been added to the pharmacy at Emily's hospital,

167
0:09:45.742,000 --> 0:09:46,000
for arthritis.

168
0:09:47.419,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So when we found Emily had these very high levels of IL-6,

169
0:09:50.522,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I called her doctors in the ICU and said,

170
0:09:53.284,000 --> 0:09:55,000
"Why don't you treat her with this arthritis drug?"

171
0:09:56.7,000 --> 0:09:58,000
They said I was a cowboy for suggesting that.

172
0:09:59.517,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And since her fever and low blood pressure

173
0:10:01.978,000 --> 0:10:04,000
had not responded to any other therapy,

174
0:10:05.292,000 --> 0:10:08,000
her doctor quickly asked permission to the institutional review board,

175
0:10:08.626,000 --> 0:10:09,000
her parents,

176
0:10:09.807,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and everybody, of course, said yes.

177
0:10:11.641,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And they tried it,

178
0:10:12.866,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and the results were nothing short of striking.

179
0:10:16.701,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Within hours after treatment with tocilizumab,

180
0:10:19.383,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Emily began to improve very rapidly.

181
0:10:22.764,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Twenty-three days after her treatment,

182
0:10:26.122,000 --> 0:10:28,000
she was declared cancer-free.

183
0:10:28.22,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And today, she's 12 years old and still in remission.

184
0:10:34.84,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Applause)

185
0:10:44.707,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So we now call this violent reaction of the high fevers and coma,

186
0:10:50.557,000 --> 0:10:51,000
following CAR T cells,

187
0:10:51.739,000 --> 0:10:53,000
cytokine release syndrome, or CRS.

188
0:10:54.387,000 --> 0:10:57,000
We've found that it occurs in nearly all patients who respond to the therapy.

189
0:10:58.276,000 --> 0:11:01,000
But it does not happen in those patients who fail to respond.

190
0:11:01.673,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So paradoxically,

191
0:11:04.466,000 --> 0:11:08,000
our patients now hope for these high fevers after therapy,

192
0:11:08.95,000 --> 0:11:1,000
which feels like "the worst flu in their life,"

193
0:11:11.776,000 --> 0:11:12,000
when they get CAR T-cell therapies.

194
0:11:13.57,000 --> 0:11:14,000
They hope for this reaction

195
0:11:14.899,000 --> 0:11:17,000
because they know it's part of the twisting and turning path

196
0:11:18.053,000 --> 0:11:19,000
back to health.

197
0:11:19.403,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Unfortunately, not every patient recovers.

198
0:11:22.458,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Patients who do not get CRS are often those who are not cured.

199
0:11:27.258,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So there's a strong link now between CRS

200
0:11:30.457,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and the ability of the immune system to eradicate leukemia.

201
0:11:33.973,000 --> 0:11:34,000
That's why last summer,

202
0:11:35.156,000 --> 0:11:4,000
when the FDA approved CAR T cells for leukemia,

203
0:11:41.252,000 --> 0:11:47,000
they also co-approved the use of tocilizumab to block the IL-6 effects

204
0:11:47.394,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and the accompanying CRS in these patients.

205
0:11:50.711,000 --> 0:11:53,000
That was a very unusual event in medical history.

206
0:11:54.784,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Emily's doctors have now completed further trials

207
0:11:59.499,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and reported that 27 out of 30 patients, the first 30 we treated,

208
0:12:04.131,000 --> 0:12:05,000
or 90 percent,

209
0:12:05.311,000 --> 0:12:06,000
had a complete remission

210
0:12:08.175,000 --> 0:12:1,000
after CAR T cells, within a month.

211
0:12:10.83,000 --> 0:12:14,000
A 90 percent complete remission rate in patients with advanced cancer

212
0:12:15.354,000 --> 0:12:16,000
is unheard of

213
0:12:16.534,000 --> 0:12:18,000
in more than 50 years of cancer research.

214
0:12:19.431,000 --> 0:12:23,000
In fact, companies often declare success in a cancer trial

215
0:12:24.22,000 --> 0:12:27,000
if 15 percent of the patients had a complete response rate.

216
0:12:28.18,000 --> 0:12:32,000
A remarkable study appeared in the "New England Journal of Medicine" in 2013.

217
0:12:32.673,000 --> 0:12:35,000
An international study has since confirmed those results.

218
0:12:36.442,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And that led to the approval by the FDA

219
0:12:40.038,000 --> 0:12:44,000
for pediatric and young adult leukemia in August of 2017.

220
0:12:45.275,000 --> 0:12:48,000
So as a first-ever approval of a cell and gene therapy,

221
0:12:48.726,000 --> 0:12:5,000
CAR T-cell therapy has also been tested now

222
0:12:50.966,000 --> 0:12:52,000
in adults with refractory lymphoma.

223
0:12:53.885,000 --> 0:12:56,000
This disease afflicts about 20,000 a year in the United States.

224
0:12:58.004,000 --> 0:13:01,000
The results were equally impressive and have been durable to date.

225
0:13:02.172,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And six months ago, the FDA approved the therapy of this advanced lymphoma

226
0:13:07.073,000 --> 0:13:08,000
with CAR T cells.

227
0:13:08.974,000 --> 0:13:13,000
So now there are many labs and physicians and scientists around the world

228
0:13:14.015,000 --> 0:13:16,000
who have tested CAR T cells

229
0:13:16.136,000 --> 0:13:18,000
across many different diseases,

230
0:13:18.97,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and understandably, we're all thrilled with the rapid pace of advancement.

231
0:13:23.431,000 --> 0:13:26,000
We're so grateful to see patients who were formerly terminal

232
0:13:27.058,000 --> 0:13:3,000
return to healthy lives, as Emily has.

233
0:13:30.892,000 --> 0:13:33,000
We're thrilled to see long remissions that may, in fact, be a cure.

234
0:13:34.363,000 --> 0:13:37,000
At the same time, we're also concerned about the financial cost.

235
0:13:38.196,000 --> 0:13:42,000
It can cost up to 150,000 dollars to make the CAR T cells for each patient.

236
0:13:43.696,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And when you add in the cost of treating CRS and other complications,

237
0:13:47.375,000 --> 0:13:5,000
the cost can reach one million dollars per patient.

238
0:13:51.343,000 --> 0:13:54,000
We must remember that the cost of failure, though, is even worse.

239
0:13:55.271,000 --> 0:13:58,000
The current noncurative therapies for cancer are also expensive

240
0:13:58.61,000 --> 0:14:,000
and, in addition, the patient dies.

241
0:14:01.744,000 --> 0:14:03,000
So, of course, we'd like to see research done now

242
0:14:04.544,000 --> 0:14:06,000
to make this more efficient

243
0:14:08.367,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and increase affordability to all patients.

244
0:14:11.176,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Fortunately, this is a new and evolving field,

245
0:14:13.431,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and as with many other new therapies and services,

246
0:14:16.999,000 --> 0:14:2,000
prices will come down as industry learns to do things more efficiently.

247
0:14:21.737,000 --> 0:14:23,000
When I think about all the forks in the road

248
0:14:23.84,000 --> 0:14:25,000
that have led to CAR T-cell therapy,

249
0:14:25.974,000 --> 0:14:27,000
there is one thing that strikes me as very important.

250
0:14:29.474,000 --> 0:14:32,000
We're reminded that discoveries of this magnitude don't happen overnight.

251
0:14:33.426,000 --> 0:14:37,000
CAR T-cell therapies came to us after a 30-year journey,

252
0:14:37.776,000 --> 0:14:39,000
along a road full of setbacks and surprises.

253
0:14:41.093,000 --> 0:14:43,000
In all this world of instant gratification

254
0:14:43.529,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and 24/7, on-demand results,

255
0:14:46.601,000 --> 0:14:5,000
scientists require persistence, vision and patience

256
0:14:50.753,000 --> 0:14:51,000
to rise above all that.

257
0:14:52.816,000 --> 0:14:56,000
They can see that the fork in the road is not always a dilemma or a detour;

258
0:14:57.753,000 --> 0:15:,000
sometimes, even though we may not know it at the time,

259
0:15:01.087,000 --> 0:15:02,000
the fork is the way home.

260
0:15:03.452,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Thank you very much.

261
0:15:04.802,000 --> 0:15:07,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
These are grim economic times,

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
fellow TEDsters, grim economic times indeed.

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And so, I would like to cheer you up

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
with one of the great, albeit largely unknown,

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
commercial success stories

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
of the past 20 years.

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Comparable, in its own very peculiar way,

8
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to the achievements of Microsoft or Google.

9
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And it's an industry which has bucked the current recession

10
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
with equanimity.

11
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I refer to organized crime.

12
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Now organized crime has been around

13
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
for a very long time, I hear you say,

14
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and these would be wise words, indeed.

15
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But in the last two decades,

16
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
it has experienced an unprecedented expansion,

17
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
now accounting for roughly 15 percent

18
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
of the world's GDP.

19
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I like to call it the Global Shadow Economy,

20
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
or McMafia, for short.

21
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So what triggered this extraordinary growth

22
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
in cross-border crime?

23
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Well, of course, there is globalization,

24
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
technology, communications, all that stuff,

25
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
which we'll talk about a little bit later.

26
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But first, I would like to take you back

27
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to this event:

28
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the collapse of communism.

29
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
All across Eastern Europe, a most momentous episode

30
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
in our post-war history.

31
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now it's time for full disclosure.

32
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
This event meant a great deal to me personally.

33
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I had started smuggling books across the Iron Curtain

34
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to Democratic opposition groups in Eastern Europe,

35
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
like Solidarity in Poland,

36
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
when I was in my teens.

37
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I then started writing about Eastern Europe,

38
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and eventually I became the BBC's chief correspondent for the region,

39
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
which is what I was doing in 1989.

40
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And so when 425 million people

41
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
finally won the right

42
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to choose their own governments,

43
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I was ecstatic,

44
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
but I was also a touch worried

45
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
about some of the nastier things

46
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
lurking behind the wall.

47
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It wasn't long, for example,

48
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
before ethnic nationalism

49
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
reared its bloody head

50
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in Yugoslavia.

51
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And amongst the chaos,

52
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
amidst the euphoria,

53
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
it took me a little while to understand

54
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that some of the people who had wielded power

55
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
before 1989, in Eastern Europe,

56
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
continued to do so after the revolutions there.

57
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Obviously there were characters like this.

58
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But there were also some more unexpected people

59
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
who played a critical role in what was going on in Eastern Europe.

60
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Like this character. Remember these guys?

61
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
They used to win the gold medals in weightlifting

62
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and wrestling, every four years in the Olympics,

63
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and they were the great celebrities of communism,

64
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
with a fabulous lifestyle to go with it.

65
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
They used to get great apartments in the center of town,

66
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
casual sex on tap,

67
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and they could travel to the West very freely,

68
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
which was a great luxury at the time.

69
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It may come as a surprise, but they played a critical role

70
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
in the emergence of the market economy

71
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
in Eastern Europe.

72
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Or as I like to call them, they are

73
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
the midwives of capitalism.

74
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Here are some of those same weightlifters

75
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
after their 1989 makeover.

76
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Now in Bulgaria --

77
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
this photograph was taken in Bulgaria --

78
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
when communism collapsed all over Eastern Europe,

79
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
it wasn't just communism;

80
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
it was the state that collapsed as well.

81
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
That means your police force wasn't working.

82
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
The court system wasn't functioning properly.

83
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So what was a business man in the brave new world

84
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
of East European capitalism going to do

85
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to make sure that his contracts would be honored?

86
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Well, he would turn to people who were called, rather prosaically

87
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
by sociologists, privatized law enforcement agencies.

88
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
We prefer to know them as the mafia.

89
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And in Bulgaria, the mafia was soon joined

90
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
with 14,000 people

91
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
who were sacked from their jobs in the security services

92
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
between 1989 and 1991.

93
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Now, when your state is collapsing,

94
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
your economy is heading south at a rate of knots,

95
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
the last people you want coming on to the labor market

96
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
are 14,000 men and women whose chief skills

97
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
are surveillance,

98
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
are smuggling, building underground networks

99
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and killing people.

100
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But that's what happened all over Eastern Europe.

101
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Now, when I was working in the 1990s,

102
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I spent most of the time covering

103
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the appalling conflict in Yugoslavia.

104
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And I couldn't help notice

105
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that the people who were perpetrating the appalling atrocities,

106
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
the paramilitary organizations,

107
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
were actually the same people running

108
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
the organized criminal syndicates.

109
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And I came to think that behind the violence

110
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
lay a sinister criminal enterprise.

111
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And so I resolved to travel around the world

112
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
examining this global criminal underworld

113
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
by talking to policemen,

114
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
by talking to victims, by talking to consumers

115
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
of illicit goods and services.

116
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
But above all else, by talking to the gangsters themselves.

117
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And the Balkans was a fabulous place to start.

118
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Why? Well of course

119
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
there was the issue of law and order collapsing,

120
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
but also, as they say in the retail trade,

121
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
it's location, location, location.

122
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And what I noticed at the beginning of my research

123
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that the Balkans had turned into a vast transit zone

124
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world.

125
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Heroin, cocaine,

126
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
women being trafficked into prostitution

127
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and precious minerals.

128
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And where were they heading?

129
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The European Union, which by now

130
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization,

131
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
transforming it into

132
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
the most affluent consumer market in history,

133
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
eventually comprising some 500 million people.

134
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And a significant minority

135
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
of those 500 million people

136
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
like to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash

137
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
sleeping with prostitutes,

138
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
sticking 50 Euro notes up their nose

139
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and employing illegal migrant laborers.

140
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Now, organized crime in a globalizing world

141
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
operates in the same way as any other business.

142
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It has zones of production,

143
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
like Afghanistan and Columbia.

144
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It has zones of distribution,

145
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
like Mexico and the Balkans.

146
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And then, of course, it has zones of consumption,

147
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
like the European Union, Japan

148
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and of course, the United States.

149
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
The zones of production and distribution

150
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
tend to lie in the developing world,

151
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and they are often threatened by appalling violence

152
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and bloodshed.

153
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Take Mexico, for example.

154
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Six thousand people killed there in the last 18 months

155
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
as a direct consequence of the cocaine trade.

156
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But what about the Democratic Republic of Congo?

157
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Since 1998, five million people have died there.

158
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
It's not a conflict you read about much in the newspapers,

159
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
but it's the biggest conflict on this planet

160
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
since the Second World War.

161
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And why is it? Because mafias from all around the world

162
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
cooperate with local paramilitaries

163
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
in order to seize the supplies

164
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
of the rich mineral resources

165
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
of the region.

166
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
In the year 2000, 80 percent of the world's coltan

167
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
was sourced to the killing fields

168
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.

169
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Now, coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone,

170
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
in almost every laptop

171
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and games console.

172
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
The Congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia

173
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
in exchange for weapons,

174
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and the mafia would then sell it on to Western markets.

175
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And it is this Western desire

176
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
to consume

177
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that is the primary driver

178
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
of international organized crime.

179
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Now, let me show you some of my friends in action,

180
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
caught conveniently on film by the Italian police,

181
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and smuggling duty-not-paid cigarettes.

182
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Now, cigarettes out the factory gate are very cheap.

183
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
The European Union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world.

184
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So if you can smuggle them into the E.U.,

185
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
there are very handsome profits to be made,

186
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and I want to show you this to demonstrate

187
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
the type of resources available to these groups.

188
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
This boat is worth one million Euros when it's new.

189
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And it's the fastest thing on European waters.

190
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
From 1994, for seven years,

191
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
20 of these boats

192
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
made the trip across the Adriatic,

193
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
from Montenegro to Italy, every single night.

194
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And as a consequence of this trade,

195
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue.

196
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And instead that money went to underwrite the wars in Yugoslavia

197
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals.

198
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Now Italian police, when this trade started,

199
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
had just two boats which could go at the same speed.

200
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And this is very important, because the only way you can catch these guys

201
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
is if they run out of gas.

202
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Sometimes the gangsters would bring with them

203
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
women being trafficked into prostitution,

204
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
and if the police intervened, they would hurl

205
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
the women into the sea

206
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
so that the police had to go and save them from drowning,

207
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
rather than chasing the bad guys.

208
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So I have shown you this to demonstrate

209
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
how many boats, how many vessels it takes

210
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to catch one of these guys.

211
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And the answer is six vessels.

212
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And remember, 20 of these speed boats

213
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
were coming across the Adriatic

214
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
every single night.

215
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So what were these guys doing with all the money they were making?

216
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Well, this is where we come to globalization,

217
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
because that was not just the deregulation of global trade.

218
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It was the liberalization of international financial markets.

219
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And boy, did that make it easy

220
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
for the money launderers.

221
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
The last two decades have been the champagne era

222
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
for dirty lucre.

223
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
In the 1990s, we saw financial centers around the world

224
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
competing for their business,

225
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and there was simply no effective mechanism

226
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
to prevent money laundering.

227
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And a lot of licit banks were also happy

228
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
to accept deposits

229
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
from very dubious sources

230
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
without questions being asked.

231
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
But at the heart of this, is the offshore banking network.

232
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Now these things

233
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
are an essential part of the money laundering parade,

234
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion

235
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and transnational organized crime, money laundering,

236
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
you have to get rid of them.

237
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
On a positive note, we at last have someone in the White House

238
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
who has consistently spoken out

239
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
against these corrosive entities.

240
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And if anyone is concerned about what I believe

241
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
is the necessity for

242
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
new legislation, regulation, effective regulation,

243
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
I say, let's take a look at Bernie Madoff,

244
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
who is now going to be spending the rest of his life in jail.

245
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Bernie Madoff stole 65 billion dollars.

246
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
That puts him up there on the Olympus of gangsters

247
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
with the Colombian cartels

248
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and the major Russian crime syndicates,

249
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
but he did this for decades

250
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
in the very heart of Wall Street,

251
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and no regulator picked up on it.

252
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So how many other Madoffs are there on Wall Street

253
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
or in the city of London,

254
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
fleecing ordinary folk

255
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and money laundering?

256
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Well I can tell you, it's quite a few of them.

257
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Let me go on to the 101 of international organized crime now.

258
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And that is narcotics. Our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning.

259
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
This one, however, is in central British Columbia

260
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
where I photographed it.

261
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
It's one of the tens of thousands

262
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
of mom-and-pop grow-ops in B.C.

263
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
which ensure that over five percent

264
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
of the province's GDP is accounted for by this trade.

265
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Now, I was taken by inspector Brian Cantera,

266
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,

267
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
to a cavernous warehouse east of Vancouver

268
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated

269
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
by the RCMP

270
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
from the smugglers who are sending it,

271
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
of course, down south to the United States

272
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
where there is an insatiable market

273
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
for B.C. Bud, as it's called,

274
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
in part because it's marketed as organic,

275
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
which of course goes down very well in California.

276
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
(Laughter)

277
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
(Applause)

278
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Now, even by the police's admission,

279
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
this makes not a dent in the profits, really,

280
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
of the major exporters.

281
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Since the beginning of globalization,

282
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
the global narcotics market has expanded enormously.

283
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
There has, however, been no concomitant increase

284
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
in the resources available

285
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
to police forces.

286
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
This, however, may all be about to change,

287
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
because something very strange is going on.

288
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
The United Nations recognized

289
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
earlier this -- it was last month actually --

290
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that Canada has become a key area of distribution and production

291
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
of ecstasy and other synthetic drugs.

292
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Interestingly, the market share

293
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
of heroin and cocaine is going down,

294
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
because the pills are getting ever better at reproducing their highs.

295
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Now that is a game changer,

296
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
because it shifts production away from the developing world

297
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and into the Western world.

298
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
When that happens, it is a trend

299
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the West.

300
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
The drugs policy which we've had in place for 40 years

301
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
is long overdue for a very serious rethink,

302
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
in my opinion.

303
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Now, the recession.

304
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
Well, organized crime has already adapted

305
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
very well to the recession.

306
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Not surprising, the most opportunistic industry

307
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
in the whole world.

308
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And it has no rules to its regulatory system.

309
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Except, of course, it has two business risks:

310
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
arrest by law enforcement,

311
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
which is, frankly, the least of their worries,

312
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and competition from other groups,

313
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
i.e. a bullet in the back of the head.

314
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
What they've done is they've shifted their operations.

315
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
People don't smoke as much dope, or visit prostitutes quite so frequently

316
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
during a recession.

317
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And so instead, they have invaded financial

318
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and corporate crime in a big way,

319
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
but above all, two sectors,

320
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and that is counterfeit goods

321
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and cybercrime.

322
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
And it's been terribly successful.

323
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
I would like to introduce you to Mr. Pringle.

324
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Or perhaps I should say, more accurately, Señor Pringle.

325
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
I was introduced to this bit of kit by a Brazilian cybercriminal.

326
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
We sat in a car on the Avenue Paulista

327
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
in São Paulo, together.

328
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Hooked it up to my laptop,

329
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and within about five minutes he had penetrated

330
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
the computer security system

331
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
of a major Brazilian bank.

332
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
It's really not that difficult.

333
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And it's actually much easier because

334
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
the fascinating thing about cybercrime

335
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
is that it's not so much the technology.

336
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
The key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering.

337
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Or to use the technical term for it,

338
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
there's one born every minute.

339
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
You would not believe how easy it is

340
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
to persuade people to do things with their computers

341
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
which are objectively not in their interest.

342
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And it was very soon

343
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
when the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this,

344
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
of course, the quickest way to a person's wallet

345
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
is through the promise of sex and love.

346
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
I expect some of you remember the ILOVEYOU virus,

347
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
one of the very great worldwide viruses that came.

348
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
I was very fortunate when the ILOVEYOU virus came out,

349
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
because the first person I received it from

350
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
was an ex-girlfriend of mine.

351
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:1,000
Now, she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time,

352
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
but love was not amongst them.

353
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
(Laughter)

354
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
And so as soon as I saw this drop into my inbox,

355
0:17:18.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
I dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin

356
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and spared myself a very nasty infection.

357
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
So, cybercrime, do watch out for it.

358
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
One thing that we do know that the Internet is doing

359
0:17:32.16,000 --> 0:17:35,000
is the Internet is assisting these guys.

360
0:17:35.16,000 --> 0:17:38,000
These are mosquitos who carry the malarial parasite

361
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
which infests our blood when the mosy has had a free meal

362
0:17:42.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
at our expense.

363
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
Now, Artesunate is a very effective drug

364
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
at destroying the parasite in the early days

365
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
of infection.

366
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
But over the past year or so,

367
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
researchers in Cambodia have discovered

368
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
that what's happening is

369
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
the malarial parasite is developing a resistance.

370
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
And they fear that the reason why it's developing a resistance

371
0:18:06.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
is because Cambodians can't afford the drugs on the commercial market,

372
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
and so they buy it from the Internet.

373
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
And these pills contain only low doses

374
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:17,000
of the active ingredient.

375
0:18:17.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
Which is why

376
0:18:19.16,000 --> 0:18:23,000
the parasite is beginning to develop a resistance.

377
0:18:23.16,000 --> 0:18:25,000
The reason I say this

378
0:18:25.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
is because we have to know

379
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:29,000
that organized crime

380
0:18:29.16,000 --> 0:18:32,000
impacts all sorts of areas of our lives.

381
0:18:32.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
You don't have to sleep with prostitutes

382
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:37,000
or take drugs

383
0:18:37.16,000 --> 0:18:39,000
in order to have a relationship with organized crime.

384
0:18:39.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
They affect our bank accounts.

385
0:18:41.16,000 --> 0:18:43,000
They affect our communications, our pension funds.

386
0:18:43.16,000 --> 0:18:47,000
They even affect the food that we eat

387
0:18:47.16,000 --> 0:18:49,000
and our governments.

388
0:18:49.16,000 --> 0:18:52,000
This is no longer an issue

389
0:18:52.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
of Sicilians from Palermo and New York.

390
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:58,000
There is no romance involved with gangsters

391
0:18:58.16,000 --> 0:19:,000
in the 21st Century.

392
0:19:00.16,000 --> 0:19:03,000
This is a mighty industry,

393
0:19:03.16,000 --> 0:19:06,000
and it creates instability and violence

394
0:19:06.16,000 --> 0:19:08,000
wherever it goes.

395
0:19:08.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
It is a major economic force

396
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:14,000
and we need to take it very, very seriously.

397
0:19:14.16,000 --> 0:19:16,000
It's been a privilege talking to you.

398
0:19:16.16,000 --> 0:19:18,000
Thank you very much.

399
0:19:18.16,000 --> 0:19:21,000
(Applause)

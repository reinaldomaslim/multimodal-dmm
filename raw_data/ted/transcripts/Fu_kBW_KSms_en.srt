1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Some of the greatest innovations

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and developments in the world

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
often happen at the intersection of two fields.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
So tonight I'd like to tell you

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
about the intersection that I'm most excited about at this very moment,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
which is entertainment and robotics.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So if we're trying to make robots

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that can be more expressive

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and that can connect better with us in society,

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
maybe we should look to some of the human professionals

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
of artificial emotion and personality

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that occur in the dramatic arts.

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I'm also interested in creating new technologies for the arts

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and to attract people

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to science and technology.

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Some people in the last decade or two

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
have started creating artwork with technology.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
With my new venture, Marilyn Monrobot,

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I would like to use art to create tech.

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So we're based in New York City.

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And if you're a performer that wants to collaborate

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
with an adorable robot,

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
or if you have a robot that needs entertainment representation,

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
please contact me, the Bot-Agent.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
The bot, our rising celebrity,

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
also has his own Twitter account: @robotinthewild.

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots, Data.

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
He's named after the Star Trek character.

30
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I think he's going to be super popular.

31
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
We've got the robot --

32
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
in his head is a database of a lot of jokes.

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes.

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So it knows something about the subject; it knows about the length.

35
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It knows how much it's moving.

36
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And so it's going to try to watch your response.

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today.

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Laughter)

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It can also learn from you

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
about the quality of its jokes

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and cater things, sort of like Netflix-style,

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
over longer-term

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
to different communities or audiences,

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
children versus adults, different cultures.

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
You can learn something from the robot

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
about the community that you're in.

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And also I can use each one of you as the acting coach

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to our future robot companions.

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Some of you in this middle section --

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
you have red/green paddles.

51
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
If you like what's going on,

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
show the green.

53
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
If you don't like the subject or the performance,

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
you can hold the red.

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Now don't be shy.

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It's just a robot.

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
It doesn't have feelings ... yet.

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And the rest of you,

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
you still count, you still matter.

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
There's also a microphone

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that's listening to the aggregate laughter and applause

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and booing -- I hope not --

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to help make some of its next decisions.

65
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Right, so,

66
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
let the robot stand-up comedy begin.

67
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Data: Hello TEDWomen.

68
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It's an honor to be here.

69
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
(Applause)

71
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
You guys are looking good out there.

72
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Ready for some jokes?

73
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Audience: Yeah.

74
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Data: Here's the first one.

75
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Right, so,

76
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
a doctor says to his patient,

77
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
"I have bad news and worse news.

78
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The bad news is that you only have 24 hours to live."

79
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
"That's terrible," said the patient.

80
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
"How can the news possibly be worse?"

81
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
"I've been trying to contact you since yesterday."

82
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Laughter)

83
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Applause)

84
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
The Swiss have an interesting army. Five hundred years without a war.

85
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Heather Knight: He's talking about the Swiss.

86
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Data: Pretty lucky for them.

87
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Ever see that little Swiss Army knife

88
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
they have to fight with?

89
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
"Come on buddy, I have the toe clippers right here.

90
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
You get past me,

91
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the guy behind me has a spoon."

92
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
HK: He's a French robot.

94
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Data: A couple of New Jersey hunters are out in the woods.

95
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
One of them falls to the ground.

96
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
He does not seem to be breathing.

97
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
The other guy whips out his cell phone

98
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and calls 911.

99
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
He gasps to the operator, "My friend is dead.

100
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
What can I do?"

101
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
The operator says, "Just take it easy.

102
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I can help.

103
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
First, let's make sure he's dead."

104
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
There is a silence,

105
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and the operator hears a shot.

106
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The guy's voice comes back on the line,

107
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
"Okay, now what?"

108
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
(Laughter)

109
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
(Applause)

110
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Question: Why is television called a medium?

111
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Anyone?

112
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Because it's neither rare nor well done.

113
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But to be completely honest with you,

114
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I kind of love television.

115
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Any of you like television? Audience: Yes.

116
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Data: I find it incredibly educational.

117
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Actually, as soon as someone turns it on,

118
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I go into the other room and read.

119
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
That's all for now.

121
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Was that okay for my first time?

122
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
(Applause)

123
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
You've been a great audience.

124
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Thank you.

125
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
HK: Yay.

126
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Applause)

127
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So this is actually the first time

128
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
we've ever done live audience feedback to a performance.

129
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So thank you all for being a part of it.

130
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
There's a lot more to come.

131
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And we hope to learn a lot about robot expression.

132
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Thank you very much.

133
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Applause)

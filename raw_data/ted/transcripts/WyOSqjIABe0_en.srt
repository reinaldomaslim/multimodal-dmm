Damian Kulash: Thank you, thanks very much.

52
0:03:54.62,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We are OK Go,

53
0:03:56.5,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and we've been together as a band since 1998.

54
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But in the last decade,

55
0:04:01.54,000 --> 0:04:04,000
we've become known as much for the elaborate music videos,

56
0:04:04.58,000 --> 0:04:05,000
like the one we just saw,

57
0:04:05.86,000 --> 0:04:07,000
as for the songs they accompany.

58
0:04:08.5,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So we will play along with another one of those in a few minutes,

59
0:04:11.62,000 --> 0:04:12,000
but in the meantime,

60
0:04:12.86,000 --> 0:04:15,000
we want to address this question that we get asked all the time

61
0:04:16.22,000 --> 0:04:18,000
but we've really never come up with an adequate answer for it,

62
0:04:19.22,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and that is, how do we think of those ideas?

63
0:04:23.22,000 --> 0:04:25,000
The videos are not all Rube Goldberg machines, by the way.

64
0:04:25.98,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Last year we did a dance in zero gravity,

65
0:04:28.099,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and once we set up an obstacle course

66
0:04:31.899,000 --> 0:04:33,000
out of thousands of musical instruments in the desert,

67
0:04:34.66,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and then played them by stunt driving a car through them.

68
0:04:37.38,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Laughter)

69
0:04:38.42,000 --> 0:04:39,000
For one of the videos,

70
0:04:39.7,000 --> 0:04:41,000
we choreographed hundreds of people with umbrellas

71
0:04:42.1,000 --> 0:04:44,000
in an abandoned parking lot outside Tokyo,

72
0:04:44.5,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and then filmed them from a drone a half a mile in the air.

73
0:04:48.34,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So it's all of these ideas that people are curious about,

74
0:04:51.98,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and the reason we've had so much trouble describing how we think of these ideas

75
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
is that it doesn't really feel like we think of them at all.

76
0:05:00.22,000 --> 0:05:01,000
It feels like we find them.

77
0:05:03.78,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And by way of explanation --

78
0:05:05.7,000 --> 0:05:08,000
well, I have a compulsive habit.

79
0:05:08.9,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I play parallax and perspective games with my eyes pretty much all the time,

80
0:05:13.98,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and it's something I've been doing since I was a teenager.

81
0:05:16.74,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And I think the big contributing factor may have been

82
0:05:19.5,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that this is how I decorated my high school bedroom.

83
0:05:22.1,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Laughter)

84
0:05:23.74,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And being a teenager,

85
0:05:25.02,000 --> 0:05:27,000
what I did in there, of course, was just talk on the phone

86
0:05:27.78,000 --> 0:05:3,000
for staggering amounts of time.

87
0:05:30.98,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So I was in this visual maelstrom

88
0:05:33.38,000 --> 0:05:35,000
just pretty much usually sitting in one place,

89
0:05:35.58,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and I guess just the overload in general --

90
0:05:38.38,000 --> 0:05:41,000
my brain kind of tried to make sense of it, and I would --

91
0:05:41.58,000 --> 0:05:43,000
If I could move my head off to one side a little bit,

92
0:05:44.1,000 --> 0:05:46,000
the edge of the desk would line up just perfectly

93
0:05:46.46,000 --> 0:05:47,000
with that poster on the opposite wall;

94
0:05:48.3,000 --> 0:05:49,000
or if I put my thumb out,

95
0:05:49.58,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I could close first my left eye and then my right,

96
0:05:51.98,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and my thumb would bounce back and forth

97
0:05:53.94,000 --> 0:05:55,000
between Jimi Hendrix's left eye and his right.

98
0:05:56.14,000 --> 0:05:57,000
(Laughter)

99
0:05:57.38,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It was not a conscious thing, of course,

100
0:05:59.74,000 --> 0:06:02,000
this is just kind of the equivalent of doodling while you're talking,

101
0:06:03.02,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and it's still something I do all the time.

102
0:06:05.14,000 --> 0:06:06,000
This is my wife, Kristin --

103
0:06:06.5,000 --> 0:06:07,000
(Applause)

104
0:06:07.7,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Yeah!

105
0:06:09.18,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Woo!

106
0:06:11.22,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And it's not uncommon that we are out at dinner,

107
0:06:14.74,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and in the middle of a great conversation she'll just stop mid-sentence,

108
0:06:18.18,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and when she stops is when I realize that I'm the one who's acting weird

109
0:06:21.62,000 --> 0:06:22,000
because I'm like bobbing and weaving.

110
0:06:23.46,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And what I'm trying to do is get that ficus back there

111
0:06:26.06,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to stick out of her head like a ponytail.

112
0:06:28.06,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Laughter)

113
0:06:30.42,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The point of telling you all this is that --

114
0:06:33.34,000 --> 0:06:35,000
for me this is what it feels like to have an idea.

115
0:06:35.74,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It's like they're made of these disparate parts,

116
0:06:39.3,000 --> 0:06:41,000
these disparate chunks sort of floating out there.

117
0:06:41.7,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And if you're receptive and you're observant,

118
0:06:44.78,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and crucially, if you're in exactly the right place,

119
0:06:47.38,000 --> 0:06:49,000
you can get them to just line up.

120
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So if you get used to --

121
0:06:51.54,000 --> 0:06:53,000
if it's your job to think of ideas this way,

122
0:06:54.1,000 --> 0:06:56,000
they'll start beckoning to you

123
0:06:56.38,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the way that Jimi's eyes beckoned from that poster,

124
0:06:58.82,000 --> 0:07:,000
or the ficus beckons from behind Kristin's head.

125
0:07:01.46,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Writing music feels like that process just over and over again,

126
0:07:04.46,000 --> 0:07:08,000
like you've got a bunch of sounds or a groove or a chord progression

127
0:07:08.86,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and you're just looking for that thing on the other side,

128
0:07:11.58,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that little chunk over there, that puzzle piece that clicks right in.

129
0:07:15.18,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And when it does click,

130
0:07:16.54,000 --> 0:07:18,000
it doesn't feel like you thought up that puzzle piece,

131
0:07:19.22,000 --> 0:07:2,000
it feels like you found it --

132
0:07:20.9,000 --> 0:07:23,000
like it was a set of relationships that you unlocked.

133
0:07:25.58,000 --> 0:07:27,000
But with the videos in particular,

134
0:07:28.22,000 --> 0:07:3,000
we're usually looking for this specific feeling

135
0:07:30.46,000 --> 0:07:31,000
which is wonder.

136
0:07:31.74,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And there's always a component of surprise to wonder,

137
0:07:34.66,000 --> 0:07:36,000
so we're not just looking for good ideas,

138
0:07:37.02,000 --> 0:07:39,000
we're looking for good ideas that surprise us in some way.

139
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And this causes something of a problem,

140
0:07:42.5,000 --> 0:07:43,000
because ...

141
0:07:45.06,000 --> 0:07:47,000
the process that we all use to make stuff,

142
0:07:47.5,000 --> 0:07:5,000
it actually has a very strong bias against surprising ideas.

143
0:07:51.06,000 --> 0:07:53,000
The process I'm talking about is the one you all know --

144
0:07:53.74,000 --> 0:07:54,000
we all do it all the time.

145
0:07:55.02,000 --> 0:07:56,000
You think of an idea.

146
0:07:56.46,000 --> 0:07:58,000
You just sit and think of your brilliant idea

147
0:07:58.62,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and then you come up with a plan

148
0:08:00.22,000 --> 0:08:02,000
for how you're going to make that idea happen.

149
0:08:02.42,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And then with that plan in mind,

150
0:08:04.02,000 --> 0:08:06,000
you go back and double-check your original idea

151
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and maybe revise it,

152
0:08:07.54,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and then bouncing back and forth between the idea and the plan,

153
0:08:10.54,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the plan and the idea,

154
0:08:11.78,000 --> 0:08:13,000
eventually you come up with a truly great plan.

155
0:08:14.02,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And then once you have that, and only then,

156
0:08:16.1,000 --> 0:08:18,000
do you go out and you execute.

157
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And this is like --

158
0:08:19.94,000 --> 0:08:21,000
this is sort of a flawless system

159
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
in terms of maximizing your resources,

160
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
because this -- super cheap.

161
0:08:27.42,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Thinking usually costs very little,

162
0:08:29.14,000 --> 0:08:31,000
but this is really expensive most of the time,

163
0:08:31.34,000 --> 0:08:32,000
so by the time you get there,

164
0:08:32.78,000 --> 0:08:34,000
you want to make sure you're super prepared

165
0:08:34.86,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and you can squeeze every last drop out of what you've got.

166
0:08:37.7,000 --> 0:08:38,000
But there are problems with this,

167
0:08:39.34,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and math will help us reveal the biggest one.

168
0:08:42.7,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Go back to that video that we just showed you.

169
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
That Rube Goldberg machine,

170
0:08:47.02,000 --> 0:08:49,000
it had about 130 interactions in it.

171
0:08:49.34,000 --> 0:08:5,000
That was 130 things

172
0:08:52.02,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that we had to have go according to our plan.

173
0:08:54.859,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So let's assume that we want to make a new video now,

174
0:08:58.74,000 --> 0:09:01,000
similarly complex -- 130 moving parts.

175
0:09:02.62,000 --> 0:09:04,000
If we're really good planners in that system,

176
0:09:05.18,000 --> 0:09:08,000
it seems like maybe we could be good enough

177
0:09:08.46,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to get every part of that system to be 90 percent reliable.

178
0:09:13.14,000 --> 0:09:14,000
90 percent sounds good, right?

179
0:09:14.62,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Well, it's not.

180
0:09:15.9,000 --> 0:09:17,000
It's terrible actually. The numbers say so.

181
0:09:18.22,000 --> 0:09:22,000
The chance of getting all 130 things to not fail at the same time

182
0:09:22.98,000 --> 0:09:25,000
is .9 for 90 percent to the 130th power.

183
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So calculate that out and you get ...

184
0:09:28.18,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Ding)

185
0:09:29.74,000 --> 0:09:34,000
.000001,

186
0:09:35.34,000 --> 0:09:37,000
which is one ten-thousandth of one percent,

187
0:09:37.82,000 --> 0:09:4,000
so your chance for success is literally one in a million.

188
0:09:41.62,000 --> 0:09:42,000
(Whistle)

189
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
(Laughter)

190
0:09:44.98,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I mean that's not a gamble I want to take,

191
0:09:47.46,000 --> 0:09:5,000
so let's ratchet up that reliability to 99 percent.

192
0:09:51.46,000 --> 0:09:53,000
.99 to the 130th power is ...

193
0:09:54.34,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Ding)

194
0:09:55.5,000 --> 0:09:56,000
.27 -- 27 percent.

195
0:09:57.46,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Significantly less daunting --

196
0:09:59.06,000 --> 0:10:,000
like this might even be usable.

197
0:10:00.58,000 --> 0:10:01,000
But really think about that.

198
0:10:01.98,000 --> 0:10:05,000
How many parts of your lives are 99 percent reliable?

199
0:10:06.34,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And could you really get 130 of them all in one place at once?

200
0:10:11.02,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And if you really could,

201
0:10:13.34,000 --> 0:10:15,000
doesn't it seem like you deserve to succeed?

202
0:10:15.82,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Like that is --

203
0:10:17.34,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that thing is going to work, right?

204
0:10:19.06,000 --> 0:10:22,000
But no, it actually fails three times more often than it succeeds.

205
0:10:22.5,000 --> 0:10:23,000
So the upshot of all this

206
0:10:24.22,000 --> 0:10:27,000
is that if your project is pretty complex --

207
0:10:27.46,000 --> 0:10:3,000
like, you know, every ambitious project is --

208
0:10:30.58,000 --> 0:10:31,000
if you've got a lot of moving parts,

209
0:10:32.34,000 --> 0:10:35,000
you're basically constrained to just reshuffling ideas

210
0:10:35.98,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that have already demonstrably proven that they're 100 percent reliable.

211
0:10:40.86,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So now go back to me sitting with my thumb in the air

212
0:10:43.38,000 --> 0:10:45,000
trying to line up something surprising.

213
0:10:45.46,000 --> 0:10:48,000
If the only things I'm allowed to consider in the first place

214
0:10:48.58,000 --> 0:10:52,000
are ideas that have already been done over and over and over again,

215
0:10:52.7,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I am screwed.

216
0:10:55.82,000 --> 0:10:56,000
However, there are ways around this,

217
0:10:57.58,000 --> 0:11:01,000
because we all know that there are tons of untried ideas still out there,

218
0:11:02.02,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and plenty of them will turn out to be every bit as reliable as we need,

219
0:11:05.7,000 --> 0:11:07,000
it's just that we don't yet know they are reliable

220
0:11:08.1,000 --> 0:11:09,000
when we are at this planning phase.

221
0:11:10.06,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So what we do is we try to identify some place

222
0:11:13.78,000 --> 0:11:16,000
where there might just be a ton of those untried ideas.

223
0:11:16.98,000 --> 0:11:18,000
We try to find a sandbox

224
0:11:19.22,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and then we gamble a whole bunch of our resources

225
0:11:21.78,000 --> 0:11:23,000
on getting in that sandbox and playing.

226
0:11:24.62,000 --> 0:11:25,000
(Laughter)

227
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Because we have to trust that it's the process in the sandbox

228
0:11:29.3,000 --> 0:11:32,000
that will reveal to us which ideas are not only surprising,

229
0:11:33.18,000 --> 0:11:35,000
but surprisingly reliable.

230
0:11:35.42,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So some of the sandboxes that we've started videos with.

231
0:11:38.46,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Let's play with optical illusions.

232
0:11:42.02,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Let's try to dance on moving surfaces.

233
0:11:44.54,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Let's try to make toast with a laser cutter.

234
0:11:48.02,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Or let's do something in one of those zero-gravity airplanes.

235
0:11:53.22,000 --> 0:11:55,000
But then instead of actually trying to sit there

236
0:11:55.5,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and think out what that something is,

237
0:11:57.34,000 --> 0:12:,000
we spent a full third of our budget getting in an actual Vomit Comet

238
0:12:01.3,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and bouncing off the walls for a week.

239
0:12:04.02,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So this may seem to you like testing,

240
0:12:07.94,000 --> 0:12:08,000
but it really isn't,

241
0:12:09.58,000 --> 0:12:11,000
because at this point we don't yet know what our idea is,

242
0:12:12.54,000 --> 0:12:14,000
we don't have a plan to be testing.

243
0:12:15.3,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So we're just --

244
0:12:16.82,000 --> 0:12:17,000
we're just playing,

245
0:12:18.06,000 --> 0:12:2,000
we're just trying everything we can think of,

246
0:12:20.22,000 --> 0:12:24,000
because we need to get this idea space filled up with a chaos

247
0:12:24.34,000 --> 0:12:26,000
like the one in my high school bedroom.

248
0:12:26.5,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Because then, if we can do the bob and weave thing,

249
0:12:29.46,000 --> 0:12:33,000
if we can put our thumbs up and get just a few things to line up --

250
0:12:33.5,000 --> 0:12:34,000
(Ding)

251
0:12:34.74,000 --> 0:12:37,000
chances are no one else has ever made those same things line up before.

252
0:12:39.1,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And when we're done with that project,

253
0:12:40.94,000 --> 0:12:42,000
people will ask us again how we thought of that idea,

254
0:12:43.46,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and we'll be stumped, because from our perspective,

255
0:12:45.9,000 --> 0:12:47,000
it doesn't feel like we thought of it at all,

256
0:12:48.06,000 --> 0:12:49,000
it just feels like we found it.

257
0:12:49.62,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So we'll play another video for you now and the song along with it.

258
0:12:52.82,000 --> 0:12:53,000
This is for the song "The One Moment,"

259
0:12:54.7,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and for this one, the sandbox was ballistics and math.

260
0:12:59.06,000 --> 0:13:04,000
So I spent a full month putting together a giant spreadsheet for this.

261
0:13:04.54,000 --> 0:13:07,000
It was like my playspace was 400 lines long

262
0:13:07.7,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and 25 columns wide --

263
0:13:10.42,000 --> 0:13:13,000
which I presume that if anybody is going to understand that, it's this crowd.

264
0:13:14.06,000 --> 0:13:15,000
(Laughter)

265
0:13:15.34,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Nothing is better than a giant spreadsheet, right?

266
0:13:17.74,000 --> 0:13:18,000
(Laughter)

267
0:13:18.98,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Well, thank you everyone, very much.

268
0:13:20.74,000 --> 0:13:21,000
We are OK Go,

269
0:13:21.98,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and this is called "The One Moment."

270
0:13:23.74,000 --> 0:13:26,000
(Applause)

271
0:13:27.74,000 --> 0:13:28,000
[The One Moment]

272
0:13:29.86,000 --> 0:13:31,000
(Explosions)

273
0:13:36.02,000 --> 0:13:38,000
[What you just saw was real

274
0:13:38.3,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and it took 4.2 seconds]

275
0:13:39.58,000 --> 0:13:4,000
(Video) Let me know when it's safe.

276
0:13:42.406,000 --> 0:13:43,000
(Percussion)

277
0:13:43.58,000 --> 0:13:45,000
[Here's the same moment ...

278
0:13:46.18,000 --> 0:13:48,000
slowed down.]

279
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
(Music)

280
0:13:53.94,000 --> 0:13:54,000
(Guitar)

281
0:14:17.06,000 --> 0:14:19,000
(Singing) You're right,

282
0:14:20.02,000 --> 0:14:22,000
there's nothing more lovely,

283
0:14:23.82,000 --> 0:14:25,000
there's nothing more profound

284
0:14:28.18,000 --> 0:14:29,000
than the certainty,

285
0:14:30.1,000 --> 0:14:33,000
than the certainty that all of this will end

286
0:14:39.34,000 --> 0:14:41,000
That all of this will end

287
0:14:44.14,000 --> 0:14:46,000
So open your arms to me,

288
0:14:46.38,000 --> 0:14:47,000
open your arms to me

289
0:14:48.1,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And this will be the one moment that matters,

290
0:14:51.74,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and this will be the one thing we remember,

291
0:14:55.5,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and this will be the reason to have been here,

292
0:14:59.42,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and this will be the one moment that matters --

293
0:15:03.5,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Oh ...

294
0:15:04.94,000 --> 0:15:08,000
(Guitar)

295
0:15:11.1,000 --> 0:15:16,000
(Singing) So while the mud reclaims our footprints,

296
0:15:17.98,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and while our bones keep looking back

297
0:15:21.86,000 --> 0:15:23,000
at the overgrowth that's swallowing the path --

298
0:15:25.74,000 --> 0:15:27,000
but for the grace of God go we,

299
0:15:29.58,000 --> 0:15:31,000
but for the grace of God go we

300
0:15:33.5,000 --> 0:15:37,000
But for the grace of time and chance and entropy's cruel hands --

301
0:15:38.3,000 --> 0:15:4,000
So open your arms to me,

302
0:15:40.46,000 --> 0:15:41,000
open your arms to me

303
0:15:42.3,000 --> 0:15:45,000
And this will be the one moment that matters,

304
0:15:45.9,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and this will be the one thing we remember,

305
0:15:49.78,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and this will be the reason to have been here,

306
0:15:53.62,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and this will be the one moment that matters

307
0:15:57.66,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Oh ...

308
0:16:00.98,000 --> 0:16:02,000
So won't you stay here with me

309
0:16:03.54,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and we'll build 'til we've blistered our hands

310
0:16:08.82,000 --> 0:16:12,000
So won't you stay here with me and we'll build us some temples,

311
0:16:13.42,000 --> 0:16:14,000
build us some castles,

312
0:16:15.42,000 --> 0:16:16,000
build us some monuments

313
0:16:17.1,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and burn them all right down

314
0:16:19.82,000 --> 0:16:22,000
(Music)

315
0:16:30.54,000 --> 0:16:32,000
(Singing) So open your arms to me

316
0:16:34.5,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And this will be the one moment that matters,

317

and this will be the one thing we remember,

319
0:16:45.86,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and this will be the one moment that matters

320
0:16:50.02,000 --> 0:16:51,000
So won't you stay here with me,

321
0:16:51.94,000 --> 0:16:53,000
we'll build 'til we blister our hands

322
0:16:54.22,000 --> 0:16:57,000
And this will be the one moment that matters --

323
0:16:57.38,000 --> 0:17:01,000
So won't you stay here with me and build us some temples --

324
0:17:01.86,000 --> 0:17:04,000
This will be the one moment that matters --

325
0:17:05.82,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Build us some temples --

326
0:17:07.42,000 --> 0:17:08,000
The one moment that matters --

327
0:17:09.3,000 --> 0:17:1,000
Build us some monuments --

328
0:17:11.3,000 --> 0:17:13,000
The one moment that matters

329
0:17:13.34,000 --> 0:17:14,000
Build us some temples --

330
0:17:15.14,000 --> 0:17:17,000
The one moment that matters.

331
0:17:17.38,000 --> 0:17:18,000
Build us some monuments --

332
0:17:18.86,000 --> 0:17:2,000
The one moment that matters, oh

333
0:17:21.74,000 --> 0:17:24,000
(Guitar)

334
0:17:26.78,000 --> 0:17:29,000
(Applause)

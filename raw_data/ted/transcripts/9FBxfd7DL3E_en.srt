1
0:00:12.604,000 --> 0:00:15,000
When I was President of the American Psychological Association,

2
0:00:15.7,000 --> 0:00:16,000
they tried to media-train me.

3
0:00:17.35,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And an encounter I had with CNN summarizes

4
0:00:23.05,000 --> 0:00:24,000
what I'm going to be talking about today,

5
0:00:25.062,000 --> 0:00:28,000
which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic.

6
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
The editor of Discover told us 10 of them;

7
0:00:34.359,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I'm going to give you the eleventh.

8
0:00:36.478,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So they came to me, CNN, and they said, "Professor Seligman --

9
0:00:41.71,000 --> 0:00:44,000
would you tell us about the state of psychology today?

10
0:00:44.947,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We'd like to interview you about that."

11
0:00:46.888,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And I said, "Great."

12
0:00:48.126,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And she said, "But this is CNN, so you only get a sound bite."

13
0:00:53.469,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I said, "Well, how many words do I get?"

14
0:00:56.707,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And she said, "Well, one."

15
0:00:58.368,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

16
0:01:00.178,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And the cameras rolled, and she said,

17
0:01:02.541,000 --> 0:01:05,000
"Professor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?"

18
0:01:07.388,000 --> 0:01:08,000
"Good."

19
0:01:08.571,000 --> 0:01:1,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:10.723,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"Cut! Cut. That won't do.

21
0:01:15.064,000 --> 0:01:17,000
We'd really better give you a longer sound bite."

22
0:01:17.87,000 --> 0:01:18,000
"How many words do I get this time?"

23
0:01:19.624,000 --> 0:01:2,000
"Well, you get two."

24
0:01:21.064,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:22.82,000 --> 0:01:25,000
"Doctor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?"

26
0:01:27.767,000 --> 0:01:28,000
"Not good."

27
0:01:28.963,000 --> 0:01:35,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:40.717,000 --> 0:01:41,000
"Look, Doctor Seligman,

29
0:01:41.913,000 --> 0:01:43,000
we can see you're really not comfortable in this medium.

30
0:01:44.931,000 --> 0:01:46,000
We'd better give you a real sound bite.

31
0:01:47.344,000 --> 0:01:49,000
This time you can have three words.

32
0:01:50.449,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Professor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?"

33
0:01:55.362,000 --> 0:01:56,000
"Not good enough."

34
0:01:58.165,000 --> 0:02:,000
That's what I'm going to be talking about.

35
0:02:00.273,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I want to say why psychology was good, why it was not good,

36
0:02:04.406,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and how it may become, in the next 10 years, good enough.

37
0:02:08.902,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And by parallel summary, I want to say the same thing about technology,

38
0:02:13.238,000 --> 0:02:14,000
about entertainment and design,

39
0:02:14.967,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because I think the issues are very similar.

40
0:02:17.495,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So, why was psychology good?

41
0:02:20.547,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Well, for more than 60 years, psychology worked within the disease model.

42
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Ten years ago, when I was on an airplane

43
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and I introduced myself to my seatmate, and told them what I did,

44
0:02:31.207,000 --> 0:02:32,000
they'd move away from me,

45
0:02:34.022,000 --> 0:02:36,000
because, quite rightly, they were saying

46
0:02:36.497,000 --> 0:02:38,000
psychology is about finding what's wrong with you.

47
0:02:39.12,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Spot the loony.

48
0:02:40.555,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And now, when I tell people what I do, they move toward me.

49
0:02:44.951,000 --> 0:02:48,000
What was good about psychology --

50
0:02:49.364,000 --> 0:02:52,000
about the $30 billion investment NIMH made,

51
0:02:52.41,000 --> 0:02:53,000
about working in the disease model,

52
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
about what you mean by psychology --

53
0:02:56.641,000 --> 0:03:,000
is that, 60 years ago, none of the disorders were treatable;

54
0:03:01.055,000 --> 0:03:02,000
it was entirely smoke and mirrors.

55
0:03:02.991,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And now, 14 of the disorders are treatable,

56
0:03:05.478,000 --> 0:03:06,000
two of them actually curable.

57
0:03:07.891,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And the other thing that happened is that a science developed,

58
0:03:12.64,000 --> 0:03:13,000
a science of mental illness.

59
0:03:14.592,000 --> 0:03:18,000
We found out we could take fuzzy concepts

60
0:03:19.392,000 --> 0:03:21,000
like depression, alcoholism,

61
0:03:22.396,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and measure them with rigor;

62
0:03:24.429,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that we could create a classification of the mental illnesses;

63
0:03:28.604,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses.

64
0:03:33.309,000 --> 0:03:36,000
We could look across time at the same people --

65
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
people, for example, who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia --

66
0:03:41.161,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and ask what the contribution of mothering, of genetics are,

67
0:03:46.397,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and we could isolate third variables

68
0:03:48.785,000 --> 0:03:5,000
by doing experiments on the mental illnesses.

69
0:03:51.649,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And best of all, we were able, in the last 50 years,

70
0:03:55.175,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments.

71
0:03:59.882,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And then we were able to test them rigorously,

72
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
in random-assignment, placebo-controlled designs,

73
0:04:06.477,000 --> 0:04:08,000
throw out the things that didn't work,

74
0:04:08.753,000 --> 0:04:09,000
keep the things that actively did.

75
0:04:10.856,000 --> 0:04:13,000
The conclusion of that is,

76
0:04:14.043,000 --> 0:04:17,000
psychology and psychiatry of the last 60 years

77
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable.

78
0:04:22.818,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And I think that's terrific.

79
0:04:24.994,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I'm proud of it.

80
0:04:29.993,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But what was not good, the consequences of that,

81
0:04:33.675,000 --> 0:04:34,000
were three things.

82
0:04:35.115,000 --> 0:04:36,000
The first was moral;

83
0:04:36.917,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists, pathologizers;

84
0:04:41.735,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble,

85
0:04:44.801,000 --> 0:04:45,000
bricks fell on you.

86
0:04:46.574,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And we forgot that people made choices and decisions.

87
0:04:49.339,000 --> 0:04:5,000
We forgot responsibility.

88
0:04:51.228,000 --> 0:04:52,000
That was the first cost.

89
0:04:53.377,000 --> 0:04:56,000
The second cost was that we forgot about you people.

90
0:04:57.681,000 --> 0:05:,000
We forgot about improving normal lives.

91
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier,

92
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
more fulfilled, more productive.

93
0:05:09.964,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And "genius," "high-talent," became a dirty word.

94
0:05:13.687,000 --> 0:05:14,000
No one works on that.

95
0:05:15.722,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And the third problem about the disease model is,

96
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
in our rush to do something about people in trouble,

97
0:05:22.465,000 --> 0:05:25,000
in our rush to do something about repairing damage,

98
0:05:27.593,000 --> 0:05:29,000
it never occurred to us to develop interventions

99
0:05:30.232,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to make people happier -- positive interventions.

100
0:05:34.495,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So that was not good.

101
0:05:36.36,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And so that's what led people like Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert,

102
0:05:41.213,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself

103
0:05:43.146,000 --> 0:05:45,000
to work in something I call, "positive psychology,"

104
0:05:46.03,000 --> 0:05:47,000
which has three aims.

105
0:05:47.839,000 --> 0:05:51,000
The first is that psychology should be just as concerned

106
0:05:52.749,000 --> 0:05:54,000
with human strength as it is with weakness.

107
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
It should be just as concerned with building strength

108
0:06:00.83,000 --> 0:06:02,000
as with repairing damage.

109
0:06:02.992,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It should be interested in the best things in life.

110
0:06:05.699,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And it should be just as concerned

111
0:06:07.597,000 --> 0:06:1,000
with making the lives of normal people fulfilling,

112
0:06:11.334,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and with genius, with nurturing high talent.

113
0:06:16.228,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So in the last 10 years and the hope for the future,

114
0:06:20.735,000 --> 0:06:23,000
we've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology,

115
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
a science of what makes life worth living.

116
0:06:26.699,000 --> 0:06:3,000
It turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness.

117
0:06:31.268,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And any of you, for free, can go to that website --

118
0:06:34.772,000 --> 0:06:35,000
[www.authentichappiness.org]

119
0:06:36.187,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and take the entire panoply of tests of happiness.

120
0:06:38.69,000 --> 0:06:42,000
You can ask, how do you stack up for positive emotion, for meaning,

121
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
for flow, against literally tens of thousands of other people?

122
0:06:47.878,000 --> 0:06:52,000
We created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities:

123
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
a classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex ratio,

124
0:06:58.405,000 --> 0:07:,000
how they're defined, how to diagnose them,

125
0:07:00.635,000 --> 0:07:02,000
what builds them and what gets in their way.

126
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We found that we could discover the causation of the positive states,

127
0:07:09.623,000 --> 0:07:12,000
the relationship between left hemispheric activity

128
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and right hemispheric activity, as a cause of happiness.

129
0:07:20.66,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I've spent my life working on extremely miserable people,

130
0:07:23.661,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and I've asked the question:

131
0:07:25.072,000 --> 0:07:28,000
How do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you?

132
0:07:28.749,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And starting about six years ago, we asked about extremely happy people.

133
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
How do they differ from the rest of us?

134
0:07:35.724,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It turns out there's one way, very surprising --

135
0:07:39.231,000 --> 0:07:41,000
they're not more religious, they're not in better shape,

136
0:07:41.923,000 --> 0:07:44,000
they don't have more money, they're not better looking,

137
0:07:45.035,000 --> 0:07:47,000
they don't have more good events and fewer bad events.

138
0:07:47.814,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The one way in which they differ: they're extremely social.

139
0:07:52.964,000 --> 0:07:54,000
They don't sit in seminars on Saturday morning.

140
0:07:55.689,000 --> 0:07:58,000
(Laughter)

141
0:08:00.137,000 --> 0:08:01,000
They don't spend time alone.

142
0:08:01.661,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Each of them is in a romantic relationship

143
0:08:03.883,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and each has a rich repertoire of friends.

144
0:08:07.055,000 --> 0:08:11,000
But watch out here -- this is merely correlational data, not causal,

145
0:08:11.456,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and it's about happiness in the first, "Hollywood" sense,

146
0:08:15.078,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I'm going to talk about,

147
0:08:16.314,000 --> 0:08:2,000
happiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer.

148
0:08:20.504,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And I'm going to suggest to you that's not nearly enough,

149
0:08:23.363,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in just a moment.

150
0:08:25.584,000 --> 0:08:29,000
We found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries,

151
0:08:29.989,000 --> 0:08:3,000
from the Buddha to Tony Robbins.

152
0:08:31.806,000 --> 0:08:35,000
About 120 interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy.

153
0:08:37.016,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And we find that we've been able to manualize many of them,

154
0:08:41.662,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and we actually carry out

155
0:08:43.605,000 --> 0:08:46,000
random-assignment efficacy and effectiveness studies.

156
0:08:47.271,000 --> 0:08:51,000
That is, which ones actually make people lastingly happier?

157
0:08:51.451,000 --> 0:08:54,000
In a couple of minutes, I'll tell you about some of those results.

158
0:08:54.702,000 --> 0:09:,000
But the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have,

159
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill,

160
0:09:04.671,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable,

161
0:09:08.969,000 --> 0:09:11,000
is, can psychology actually make people happier?

162
0:09:12.922,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And to ask that question -- "happy" is not a word I use very much --

163
0:09:17.595,000 --> 0:09:18,000
we've had to break it down

164
0:09:19.032,000 --> 0:09:21,000
into what I think is askable about "happy."

165
0:09:21.588,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And I believe there are three different --

166
0:09:25.339,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I call them "different" because different interventions build them,

167
0:09:28.646,000 --> 0:09:3,000
it's possible to have one rather than the other --

168
0:09:31.071,000 --> 0:09:32,000
three different happy lives.

169
0:09:33.072,000 --> 0:09:36,000
The first happy life is the pleasant life.

170
0:09:36.213,000 --> 0:09:39,000
This is a life in which you have as much positive emotion

171
0:09:39.622,000 --> 0:09:4,000
as you possibly can,

172
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and the skills to amplify it.

173
0:09:43.285,000 --> 0:09:45,000
The second is a life of engagement:

174
0:09:45.489,000 --> 0:09:5,000
a life in your work, your parenting, your love, your leisure;

175
0:09:50.878,000 --> 0:09:51,000
time stops for you.

176
0:09:53.302,000 --> 0:09:55,000
That's what Aristotle was talking about.

177
0:09:55.374,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And third, the meaningful life.

178
0:09:57.465,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I want to say a little bit about each of those lives

179
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and what we know about them.

180
0:10:02.001,000 --> 0:10:06,000
The first life is the pleasant life, and it's simply, as best we can find it,

181
0:10:07.003,000 --> 0:10:09,000
it's having as many of the pleasures as you can,

182
0:10:09.314,000 --> 0:10:11,000
as much positive emotion as you can,

183
0:10:11.713,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and learning the skills -- savoring, mindfulness -- that amplify them,

184
0:10:18.274,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that stretch them over time and space.

185
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
But the pleasant life has three drawbacks,

186
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and it's why positive psychology is not happy-ology,

187
0:10:28.692,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and why it doesn't end here.

188
0:10:31.041,000 --> 0:10:34,000
The first drawback is, it turns out the pleasant life,

189
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
your experience of positive emotion,

190
0:10:36.819,000 --> 0:10:4,000
is about 50 percent heritable,

191
0:10:41.566,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and, in fact, not very modifiable.

192
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So the different tricks that Matthieu and I and others know

193
0:10:49.723,000 --> 0:10:52,000
about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life

194
0:10:53.358,000 --> 0:10:56,000
are 15 to 20 percent tricks, getting more of it.

195
0:10:57.656,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Second is that positive emotion habituates.

196
0:11:01.922,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It habituates rapidly, indeed.

197
0:11:05.746,000 --> 0:11:07,000
It's all like French vanilla ice cream:

198
0:11:08.14,000 --> 0:11:1,000
the first taste is 100 percent;

199
0:11:10.779,000 --> 0:11:12,000
by the time you're down to the sixth taste,

200
0:11:12.972,000 --> 0:11:13,000
it's gone.

201
0:11:15.817,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And, as I said, it's not particularly malleable.

202
0:11:20.6,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And this leads to the second life.

203
0:11:22.491,000 --> 0:11:23,000
I have to tell you about my friend Len,

204
0:11:24.453,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion,

205
0:11:30.388,000 --> 0:11:31,000
more than building pleasure.

206
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
In two of the three great arenas of life, by the time Len was 30,

207
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Len was enormously successful.

208
0:11:38.608,000 --> 0:11:41,000
The first arena was work.

209
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
By the time he was 20, he was an options trader.

210
0:11:44.82,000 --> 0:11:46,000
By the time he was 25, he was a multimillionaire

211
0:11:47.271,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and the head of an options trading company.

212
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Second, in play, he's a national champion bridge player.

213
0:11:57.366,000 --> 0:12:01,000
But in the third great arena of life, love, Len is an abysmal failure.

214
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And the reason he was, was that Len is a cold fish.

215
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
(Laughter)

216
0:12:10.254,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Len is an introvert.

217
0:12:14.692,000 --> 0:12:17,000
American women said to Len, when he dated them,

218
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
"You're no fun. You don't have positive emotion. Get lost."

219
0:12:22.947,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst,

220
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma

221
0:12:31.928,000 --> 0:12:34,000
that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him.

222
0:12:35.897,000 --> 0:12:38,000
But it turned out there wasn't any sexual trauma.

223
0:12:39.075,000 --> 0:12:41,000
It turned out that --

224
0:12:41.29,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Len grew up in Long Island

225
0:12:43.693,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and he played football and watched football, and played bridge.

226
0:12:50.536,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities.

227
0:12:54.77,000 --> 0:12:55,000
The question is: Is Len unhappy?

228
0:12:56.818,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And I want to say, not.

229
0:12:58.587,000 --> 0:13:,000
Contrary to what psychology told us

230
0:13:01.57,000 --> 0:13:05,000
about the bottom 50 percent of the human race in positive affectivity,

231
0:13:05.746,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I think Len is one of the happiest people I know.

232
0:13:08.362,000 --> 0:13:1,000
He's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness,

233
0:13:11.032,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and that's because Len, like most of you,

234
0:13:14.971,000 --> 0:13:16,000
is enormously capable of flow.

235
0:13:17.057,000 --> 0:13:19,000
When he walks onto the floor of the American Exchange

236
0:13:20.055,000 --> 0:13:21,000
at 9:30 in the morning,

237
0:13:22.318,000 --> 0:13:23,000
time stops for him.

238
0:13:23.633,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And it stops till the closing bell.

239
0:13:25.419,000 --> 0:13:27,000
When the first card is played till 10 days later,

240
0:13:28.343,000 --> 0:13:29,000
when the tournament is over,

241
0:13:29.725,000 --> 0:13:3,000
time stops for Len.

242
0:13:31.836,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi

243
0:13:35.072,000 --> 0:13:36,000
has been talking about, about flow.

244
0:13:36.998,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And it's distinct from pleasure in a very important way:

245
0:13:40.399,000 --> 0:13:45,000
pleasure has raw feel -- you know it's happening; it's thought and feeling.

246
0:13:45.827,000 --> 0:13:48,000
But what Mike told you yesterday -- during flow ...

247
0:13:51.079,000 --> 0:13:53,000
you can't feel anything.

248
0:13:54.732,000 --> 0:13:55,000
You're one with the music.

249
0:13:56.824,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Time stops.

250
0:13:58.101,000 --> 0:13:59,000
You have intense concentration.

251
0:14:00.019,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life.

252
0:14:05.262,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And we think there's a recipe for it,

253
0:14:08.071,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and it's knowing what your highest strengths are --

254
0:14:10.689,000 --> 0:14:12,000
again, there's a valid test

255
0:14:13.007,000 --> 0:14:15,000
of what your five highest strengths are --

256
0:14:15.414,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and then re-crafting your life

257
0:14:18.167,000 --> 0:14:21,000
to use them as much as you possibly can.

258
0:14:21.451,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Re-crafting your work, your love,

259
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
your play, your friendship, your parenting.

260
0:14:26.941,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Just one example.

261
0:14:29.248,000 --> 0:14:32,000
One person I worked with was a bagger at Genuardi's.

262
0:14:33.316,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Hated the job.

263
0:14:34.505,000 --> 0:14:35,000
She's working her way through college.

264
0:14:36.929,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Her highest strength was social intelligence.

265
0:14:40.088,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her

266
0:14:44.827,000 --> 0:14:46,000
the social highlight of every customer's day.

267
0:14:48.082,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Now, obviously she failed.

268
0:14:49.822,000 --> 0:14:52,000
But what she did was to take her highest strengths,

269
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and re-craft work to use them as much as possible.

270
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
What you get out of that is not smiley-ness.

271
0:14:59.532,000 --> 0:15:,000
You don't look like Debbie Reynolds.

272
0:15:01.459,000 --> 0:15:02,000
You don't giggle a lot.

273
0:15:02.887,000 --> 0:15:04,000
What you get is more absorption.

274
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
So, that's the second path.

275
0:15:08.258,000 --> 0:15:1,000
The first path, positive emotion;

276
0:15:10.634,000 --> 0:15:13,000
the second path is eudaemonian flow;

277
0:15:13.754,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and the third path is meaning.

278
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
This is the most venerable of the happinesses, traditionally.

279
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And meaning, in this view, consists of --

280
0:15:23.683,000 --> 0:15:25,000
very parallel to eudaemonia --

281
0:15:26.627,000 --> 0:15:29,000
it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are,

282
0:15:30.214,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and using them to belong to and in the service of

283
0:15:34.881,000 --> 0:15:36,000
something larger than you are.

284
0:15:39.082,000 --> 0:15:42,000
I mentioned that for all three kinds of lives --

285
0:15:43.407,000 --> 0:15:46,000
the pleasant life, the good life, the meaningful life --

286
0:15:46.774,000 --> 0:15:48,000
people are now hard at work on the question:

287
0:15:48.962,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Are there things that lastingly change those lives?

288
0:15:53.928,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And the answer seems to be yes.

289
0:15:56.951,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And I'll just give you some samples of it.

290
0:15:59.53,000 --> 0:16:01,000
It's being done in a rigorous manner.

291
0:16:01.718,000 --> 0:16:03,000
It's being done in the same way that we test drugs

292
0:16:04.579,000 --> 0:16:05,000
to see what really works.

293
0:16:06.673,000 --> 0:16:1,000
So we do random-assignment, placebo-controlled,

294
0:16:11.51,000 --> 0:16:13,000
long-term studies of different interventions.

295
0:16:14.381,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect:

296
0:16:18.91,000 --> 0:16:21,000
when we teach people about the pleasant life,

297
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
how to have more pleasure in your life,

298
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills,

299
0:16:28.203,000 --> 0:16:3,000
the savoring skills,

300
0:16:30.642,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and you're assigned to design a beautiful day.

301
0:16:34.333,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Next Saturday, set a day aside, design yourself a beautiful day,

302
0:16:39.371,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures.

303
0:16:43.589,000 --> 0:16:47,000
And we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced.

304
0:16:49.898,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Gratitude visit.

305
0:16:53.243,000 --> 0:16:55,000
I want you all to do this with me now, if you would.

306
0:16:55.923,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Close your eyes.

307
0:16:58.972,000 --> 0:17:02,000
I'd like you to remember someone

308
0:17:03.34,000 --> 0:17:06,000
who did something enormously important

309
0:17:06.412,000 --> 0:17:09,000
that changed your life in a good direction,

310
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
and who you never properly thanked.

311
0:17:13.307,000 --> 0:17:14,000
The person has to be alive.

312
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
Now, OK, you can open your eyes.

313
0:17:18.347,000 --> 0:17:2,000
I hope all of you have such a person.

314
0:17:20.705,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Your assignment, when you're learning the gratitude visit,

315
0:17:24.327,000 --> 0:17:27,000
is to write a 300-word testimonial to that person,

316
0:17:28.694,000 --> 0:17:29,000
call them on the phone in Phoenix,

317
0:17:31.321,000 --> 0:17:33,000
ask if you can visit, don't tell them why.

318
0:17:33.992,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Show up at their door,

319
0:17:36.459,000 --> 0:17:39,000
you read the testimonial -- everyone weeps when this happens.

320
0:17:41.739,000 --> 0:17:43,000
And what happens is, when we test people

321
0:17:44.665,000 --> 0:17:47,000
one week later, a month later, three months later,

322
0:17:47.808,000 --> 0:17:49,000
they're both happier and less depressed.

323
0:17:51.882,000 --> 0:17:53,000
Another example is a strengths date,

324
0:17:54.241,000 --> 0:17:58,000
in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths

325
0:17:58.447,000 --> 0:17:59,000
on the strengths test,

326
0:17:59.846,000 --> 0:18:04,000
and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths.

327
0:18:04.951,000 --> 0:18:07,000
We find this is a strengthener of relationships.

328
0:18:08.948,000 --> 0:18:09,000
And fun versus philanthropy.

329
0:18:10.946,000 --> 0:18:12,000
It's so heartening to be in a group like this,

330
0:18:13.69,000 --> 0:18:16,000
in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy.

331
0:18:17.314,000 --> 0:18:2,000
Well, my undergraduates and the people I work with haven't discovered this,

332
0:18:20.996,000 --> 0:18:22,000
so we actually have people do something altruistic

333
0:18:24.582,000 --> 0:18:25,000
and do something fun,

334
0:18:26.357,000 --> 0:18:27,000
and contrast it.

335
0:18:27.535,000 --> 0:18:29,000
And what you find is when you do something fun,

336
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:31,000
it has a square wave walk set.

337
0:18:32.073,000 --> 0:18:35,000
When you do something philanthropic to help another person,

338
0:18:35.733,000 --> 0:18:37,000
it lasts and it lasts.

339
0:18:38.686,000 --> 0:18:41,000
So those are examples of positive interventions.

340
0:18:42.84,000 --> 0:18:45,000
So the next to last thing I want to say is:

341
0:18:47.16,000 --> 0:18:5,000
we're interested in how much life satisfaction people have.

342
0:18:50.303,000 --> 0:18:51,000
This is really what you're about.

343
0:18:52.267,000 --> 0:18:53,000
And that's our target variable.

344
0:18:54.16,000 --> 0:18:57,000
And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives,

345
0:18:58.16,000 --> 0:19:,000
how much life satisfaction do you get?

346
0:19:00.907,000 --> 0:19:03,000
So we ask -- and we've done this in 15 replications,

347
0:19:04.036,000 --> 0:19:06,000
involving thousands of people:

348
0:19:06.438,000 --> 0:19:08,000
To what extent does the pursuit of pleasure,

349
0:19:08.957,000 --> 0:19:09,000
the pursuit of positive emotion,

350
0:19:11.303,000 --> 0:19:12,000
the pleasant life,

351
0:19:12.501,000 --> 0:19:15,000
the pursuit of engagement, time stopping for you,

352
0:19:15.933,000 --> 0:19:18,000
and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction?

353
0:19:19.331,000 --> 0:19:22,000
And our results surprised us; they were backward of what we thought.

354
0:19:22.949,000 --> 0:19:25,000
It turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution

355
0:19:26.477,000 --> 0:19:27,000
to life satisfaction.

356
0:19:28.16,000 --> 0:19:3,000
The pursuit of meaning is the strongest.

357
0:19:30.713,000 --> 0:19:34,000
The pursuit of engagement is also very strong.

358
0:19:35.16,000 --> 0:19:39,000
Where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement

359
0:19:39.818,000 --> 0:19:4,000
and you have meaning,

360
0:19:41.451,000 --> 0:19:43,000
then pleasure's the whipped cream and the cherry.

361
0:19:43.764,000 --> 0:19:49,000
Which is to say, the full life -- the sum is greater than the parts,

362
0:19:50.306,000 --> 0:19:51,000
if you've got all three.

363
0:19:51.736,000 --> 0:19:54,000
Conversely, if you have none of the three, the empty life,

364
0:19:55.002,000 --> 0:19:56,000
the sum is less than the parts.

365
0:19:56.683,000 --> 0:20:,000
And what we're asking now is: Does the very same relationship --

366
0:20:00.958,000 --> 0:20:04,000
physical health, morbidity, how long you live and productivity --

367
0:20:05.925,000 --> 0:20:06,000
follow the same relationship?

368
0:20:07.358,000 --> 0:20:09,000
That is, in a corporation,

369
0:20:09.86,000 --> 0:20:14,000
is productivity a function of positive emotion, engagement and meaning?

370
0:20:15.723,000 --> 0:20:18,000
Is health a function of positive engagement,

371
0:20:18.914,000 --> 0:20:2,000
of pleasure, and of meaning in life?

372
0:20:21.675,000 --> 0:20:25,000
And there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes.

373
0:20:28.364,000 --> 0:20:32,000
So, Chris said that the last speaker had a chance

374
0:20:32.817,000 --> 0:20:34,000
to try to integrate what he heard,

375
0:20:35.262,000 --> 0:20:36,000
and so this was amazing for me.

376
0:20:36.992,000 --> 0:20:39,000
I've never been in a gathering like this.

377
0:20:40.961,000 --> 0:20:43,000
I've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much,

378
0:20:44.709,000 --> 0:20:46,000
which was one of the remarkable things.

379
0:20:47.16,000 --> 0:20:5,000
But I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel

380
0:20:51.16,000 --> 0:20:55,000
to the problems of technology, entertainment and design

381
0:20:55.399,000 --> 0:20:56,000
in the following way:

382
0:20:56.898,000 --> 0:20:59,000
we all know that technology, entertainment and design

383
0:21:00.404,000 --> 0:21:05,000
have been and can be used for destructive purposes.

384
0:21:06.531,000 --> 0:21:1,000
We also know that technology, entertainment and design

385
0:21:10.71,000 --> 0:21:12,000
can be used to relieve misery.

386
0:21:13.711,000 --> 0:21:16,000
And by the way, the distinction between relieving misery

387
0:21:17.16,000 --> 0:21:19,000
and building happiness is extremely important.

388
0:21:20.16,000 --> 0:21:23,000
I thought, when I first became a therapist 30 years ago,

389
0:21:23.795,000 --> 0:21:28,000
that if I was good enough to make someone not depressed,

390
0:21:29.16,000 --> 0:21:32,000
not anxious, not angry,

391
0:21:33.027,000 --> 0:21:34,000
that I'd make them happy.

392
0:21:35.062,000 --> 0:21:36,000
And I never found that;

393
0:21:36.461,000 --> 0:21:38,000
I found the best you could ever do

394
0:21:38.507,000 --> 0:21:39,000
was to get to zero;

395
0:21:40.51,000 --> 0:21:41,000
that they were empty.

396
0:21:41.748,000 --> 0:21:46,000
And it turns out the skills of happiness, the skills of the pleasant life,

397
0:21:47.378,000 --> 0:21:49,000
the skills of engagement, the skills of meaning,

398
0:21:49.773,000 --> 0:21:53,000
are different from the skills of relieving misery.

399
0:21:54.495,000 --> 0:21:59,000
And so, the parallel thing holds with technology, entertainment

400
0:21:59.89,000 --> 0:22:,000
and design, I believe.

401
0:22:01.487,000 --> 0:22:07,000
That is, it is possible for these three drivers of our world

402
0:22:08.39,000 --> 0:22:1,000
to increase happiness,

403
0:22:10.918,000 --> 0:22:12,000
to increase positive emotion.

404
0:22:13.83,000 --> 0:22:15,000
And that's typically how they've been used.

405
0:22:16.041,000 --> 0:22:18,000
But once you fractionate happiness the way I do --

406
0:22:19.063,000 --> 0:22:22,000
not just positive emotion, that's not nearly enough --

407
0:22:22.16,000 --> 0:22:25,000
there's flow in life, and there's meaning in life.

408
0:22:25.666,000 --> 0:22:26,000
As Laura Lee told us,

409
0:22:27.16,000 --> 0:22:3,000
design and, I believe, entertainment and technology,

410
0:22:30.852,000 --> 0:22:34,000
can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well.

411
0:22:35.607,000 --> 0:22:36,000
So in conclusion,

412
0:22:37.251,000 --> 0:22:39,000
the eleventh reason for optimism,

413
0:22:39.702,000 --> 0:22:42,000
in addition to the space elevator,

414
0:22:42.901,000 --> 0:22:47,000
is that I think with technology, entertainment and design,

415
0:22:48.056,000 --> 0:22:51,000
we can actually increase the amount of tonnage

416
0:22:51.828,000 --> 0:22:53,000
of human happiness on the planet.

417
0:22:54.681,000 --> 0:22:58,000
And if technology can, in the next decade or two,

418
0:22:58.968,000 --> 0:23:01,000
increase the pleasant life, the good life and the meaningful life,

419
0:23:02.856,000 --> 0:23:03,000
it will be good enough.

420
0:23:04.37,000 --> 0:23:09,000
If entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion,

421
0:23:10.127,000 --> 0:23:13,000
meaning eudaemonia,

422
0:23:13.245,000 --> 0:23:14,000
it will be good enough.

423
0:23:14.708,000 --> 0:23:18,000
And if design can increase positive emotion,

424
0:23:20.742,000 --> 0:23:22,000
eudaemonia, and flow and meaning,

425
0:23:23.761,000 --> 0:23:26,000
what we're all doing together will become good enough.

426
0:23:27.324,000 --> 0:23:28,000
Thank you.

427
0:23:28.527,000 --> 0:23:33,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.161,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Nobody likes to make a mistake.

2
0:00:16.462,000 --> 0:00:17,000
And I made a whopping one.

3
0:00:19.534,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And figuring out what I did wrong led to a discovery

4
0:00:24.856,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that completely changes the way we think about the Earth and Moon.

5
0:00:29.531,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I'm a planetary scientist,

6
0:00:31.475,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and my favorite thing to do is smash planets together.

7
0:00:35.229,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:36.264,000 --> 0:00:41,000
In my lab, I can shoot at rocks using cannons like this one.

9
0:00:43.12,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Cannon shot)

10
0:00:44.762,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:46.278,000 --> 0:00:5,000
In my experiments, I can generate the extreme conditions

12
0:00:50.334,000 --> 0:00:51,000
during planet formation.

13
0:00:52.775,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And with computer models, I can collide whole planets together

14
0:00:56.817,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to make them grow,

15
0:00:58.551,000 --> 0:00:59,000
or I can destroy them.

16
0:01:00.162,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:02.354,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I want to understand how to make the Earth and the Moon

18
0:01:06.802,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and why the Earth is so different from other planets.

19
0:01:11.414,000 --> 0:01:14,000
The leading idea for the origin of the Earth and Moon

20
0:01:15.175,000 --> 0:01:16,000
is called the "giant impact theory."

21
0:01:18.011,000 --> 0:01:21,000
The theory states that a Mars-sized body struck the young Earth,

22
0:01:21.443,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and the Moon formed from the debris disk around the planet.

23
0:01:28.061,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The theory can explain so many things about the Moon,

24
0:01:31.296,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but it has a huge flaw:

25
0:01:34.051,000 --> 0:01:38,000
it predicts that the Moon is mostly made from the Mars-sized planet,

26
0:01:38.606,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that the Earth and the Moon are made from different materials.

27
0:01:42.504,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But that's not what we see.

28
0:01:45.154,000 --> 0:01:48,000
The Earth and the Moon are actually like identical twins.

29
0:01:49.704,000 --> 0:01:53,000
The genetic code of planets is written in the isotopes of the elements.

30
0:01:54.625,000 --> 0:01:56,000
The Earth and Moon have identical isotopes.

31
0:01:57.518,000 --> 0:02:01,000
That means that the Earth and Moon are made from the same materials.

32
0:02:03.08,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It's really strange that the Earth and the Moon are twins.

33
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
All of the planets are made from different materials,

34
0:02:09.82,000 --> 0:02:11,000
so they all have different isotopes,

35
0:02:11.973,000 --> 0:02:13,000
they all have their own genetic code.

36
0:02:14.695,000 --> 0:02:18,000
No other planetary bodies have the same genetic relationship.

37
0:02:19.824,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Only the Earth and Moon are twins.

38
0:02:23.588,000 --> 0:02:25,000
When I started working on the origin of the Moon,

39
0:02:26.187,000 --> 0:02:3,000
there were scientists that wanted to reject the whole idea of the giant impact.

40
0:02:30.288,000 --> 0:02:34,000
They didn't see any way for this theory to explain the special relationship

41
0:02:34.493,000 --> 0:02:35,000
between the Earth and the Moon.

42
0:02:36.729,000 --> 0:02:38,000
We were all trying to think of new ideas.

43
0:02:40.084,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The problem was, there weren't any better ideas.

44
0:02:43.768,000 --> 0:02:46,000
All of the other ideas had even bigger flaws.

45
0:02:48.437,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So we were trying to rescue the giant impact theory.

46
0:02:53.376,000 --> 0:02:57,000
A young scientist in my group suggested that we try changing the spin

47
0:02:58.281,000 --> 0:02:59,000
of the giant impact.

48
0:02:59.67,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Maybe making the Earth spin faster could mix more material

49
0:03:04.088,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and explain the Moon.

50
0:03:06.623,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The Mars-sized impactor had been chosen

51
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
because it could make the Moon

52
0:03:11.097,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and make the length of Earth's day.

53
0:03:15.227,000 --> 0:03:17,000
People really liked that part of the model.

54
0:03:18.481,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But what if something else determined the length of Earth's day?

55
0:03:22.484,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Then there would be many more possible giant impacts that could make the Moon.

56
0:03:28.444,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I was curious about what could happen,

57
0:03:31.133,000 --> 0:03:35,000
so I tried simulating faster-spinning giant impacts,

58
0:03:35.544,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and I found that it is possible

59
0:03:38.052,000 --> 0:03:41,000
to make a disk out of the same mixture of materials as the planet.

60
0:03:42.871,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We were pretty excited.

61
0:03:44.905,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Maybe this was the way to explain the Moon.

62
0:03:48.95,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The problem is, we also found that that's just not very likely.

63
0:03:54.278,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Most of the time, the disk is different from the planet,

64
0:03:57.382,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and it looked like making our Moon this way

65
0:04:00.243,000 --> 0:04:03,000
would be an astronomical coincidence,

66
0:04:04.243,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and it was just hard for everyone to accept the idea

67
0:04:07.251,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that the Moon's special connection to Earth was an accident.

68
0:04:13.22,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The giant impact theory was still in trouble,

69
0:04:16.911,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and we were still trying to figure out how to make the Moon.

70
0:04:21.932,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Then came the day when I realized my mistake.

71
0:04:27.471,000 --> 0:04:31,000
My student and I were looking at the data from these fast-spinning giant impacts.

72
0:04:32.434,000 --> 0:04:34,000
On that day, we weren't actually thinking about the Moon,

73
0:04:35.14,000 --> 0:04:36,000
we were looking at the planet.

74
0:04:36.819,000 --> 0:04:38,000
The planet gets super-hot and partially vaporized

75
0:04:39.382,000 --> 0:04:41,000
from the energy of the impact.

76
0:04:43.479,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But the data didn't look like a planet.

77
0:04:45.501,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It looked really strange.

78
0:04:47.388,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The planet was weirdly connected to the disk.

79
0:04:51.433,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I got that super-excited feeling

80
0:04:54.244,000 --> 0:04:57,000
when something really wrong might be something really interesting.

81
0:05:00.011,000 --> 0:05:01,000
In all of my calculations,

82
0:05:01.363,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I had assumed there was a planet with a separate disk around it.

83
0:05:04.647,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Calculating what was in the disk as how we tested

84
0:05:07.096,000 --> 0:05:09,000
whether an impact could make the Moon.

85
0:05:10.828,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But it didn't look that simple anymore.

86
0:05:15.756,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We were making the mistake

87
0:05:18.863,000 --> 0:05:22,000
of thinking that a planet was always going to look like a planet.

88
0:05:24.19,000 --> 0:05:3,000
On that day, I knew that a giant impact was making something completely new.

89
0:05:33.133,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I've had eureka moments.

90
0:05:35.655,000 --> 0:05:36,000
This was not one of them.

91
0:05:37.298,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

92
0:05:38.489,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I really didn't know what was going on.

93
0:05:42.062,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I had this strange, new object in front of me

94
0:05:44.238,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and the challenge to try and figure it out.

95
0:05:48.473,000 --> 0:05:5,000
What do you do when faced with the unknown?

96
0:05:52.054,000 --> 0:05:53,000
How do you even start?

97
0:05:55.058,000 --> 0:05:56,000
We questioned everything:

98
0:05:57.4,000 --> 0:05:58,000
What is a planet?

99
0:05:58.619,000 --> 0:06:,000
When is a planet no longer a planet anymore?

100
0:06:01.32,000 --> 0:06:03,000
We played with new ideas.

101
0:06:04.969,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We had to get rid of our old way of thinking,

102
0:06:07.177,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and by playing, I could throw away all of the data,

103
0:06:10.826,000 --> 0:06:11,000
all of the rules of the real world,

104
0:06:12.763,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and free my mind to explore.

105
0:06:16.711,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And by making a mental space

106
0:06:19.501,000 --> 0:06:21,000
where I could try out outrageous ideas

107
0:06:23.233,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and then bring them back into the real world to test them,

108
0:06:27.331,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I could learn.

109
0:06:31.423,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And by playing, we learned so much.

110
0:06:34.88,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I combined my lab experiments with computer models

111
0:06:38.362,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and discovered that after most giant impacts,

112
0:06:40.968,000 --> 0:06:42,000
the Earth is so hot, there's no surface.

113
0:06:43.154,000 --> 0:06:46,000
There's just a deep layer of gas that gets denser and denser with depth.

114
0:06:47.289,000 --> 0:06:49,000
The Earth would have been like Jupiter.

115
0:06:49.316,000 --> 0:06:5,000
There's nothing to stand on.

116
0:06:52.373,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And that was just part of the problem.

117
0:06:55.269,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I wanted to understand the whole problem.

118
0:06:58.242,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I couldn't let go of the challenge to figure out what was really going on

119
0:07:02.177,000 --> 0:07:03,000
in giant impacts.

120
0:07:04.719,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It took almost two years

121
0:07:07.191,000 --> 0:07:08,000
of throwing away old ideas

122
0:07:09.733,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and building new ones

123
0:07:11.941,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that we understood the data

124
0:07:14.637,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and knew what it meant for the Moon.

125
0:07:17.811,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I discovered a new type of astronomical object.

126
0:07:23.168,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It's not a planet.

127
0:07:25.087,000 --> 0:07:26,000
It's made from planets.

128
0:07:27.733,000 --> 0:07:29,000
A planet is a body whose self-gravity

129
0:07:30.275,000 --> 0:07:32,000
is strong enough to give it its rounded shape.

130
0:07:32.869,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It spins around all together.

131
0:07:35.415,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Make it hotter and spin it faster,

132
0:07:38.158,000 --> 0:07:41,000
the equator gets bigger and bigger until it reaches a tipping point.

133
0:07:42.629,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Push past the tipping point,

134
0:07:44.295,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and the material at the equator spreads into a disk.

135
0:07:48.953,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It's now broken all the rules of being a planet.

136
0:07:52.215,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It can't spin around together anymore,

137
0:07:54.634,000 --> 0:07:56,000
its shape keeps changing as it gets bigger and bigger;

138
0:07:57.319,000 --> 0:07:58,000
the planet has become something new.

139
0:08:00.771,000 --> 0:08:02,000
We gave our discovery its name:

140
0:08:04.61,000 --> 0:08:05,000
synestia.

141
0:08:06.402,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We named it after the goddess Hestia,

142
0:08:08.608,000 --> 0:08:1,000
the Greek goddess of the hearth and home,

143
0:08:10.938,000 --> 0:08:12,000
because we think the Earth became one.

144
0:08:13.244,000 --> 0:08:14,000
The prefix means "all together,"

145
0:08:14.819,000 --> 0:08:16,000
to emphasize the connection between all of the material.

146
0:08:18.64,000 --> 0:08:21,000
A synestia is what a planet becomes

147
0:08:21.866,000 --> 0:08:25,000
when heat and spin push it over the limit of a spheroidal shape.

148
0:08:27.691,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Would you like to see a synestia?

149
0:08:30.205,000 --> 0:08:32,000
(Cheers)

150
0:08:33.554,000 --> 0:08:36,000
In this visualization of one of my simulations,

151
0:08:37.51,000 --> 0:08:41,000
the young Earth is already spinning quickly from a previous giant impact.

152
0:08:42.663,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Its shape is deformed, but our planet would be recognizable

153
0:08:45.923,000 --> 0:08:46,000
by the water on its surface.

154
0:08:48.692,000 --> 0:08:51,000
The energy from the impact vaporizes the surface,

155
0:08:52.573,000 --> 0:08:53,000
the water, the atmosphere,

156
0:08:54.119,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and mixes all of the gases together in just a few hours.

157
0:08:59.414,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We discovered that many giant impacts make synestias,

158
0:09:03.566,000 --> 0:09:05,000
but these burning, bright objects don't live very long.

159
0:09:06.567,000 --> 0:09:09,000
They cool down, shrink and turn back into planets.

160
0:09:11.266,000 --> 0:09:13,000
While rocky planets like Earth were growing,

161
0:09:13.713,000 --> 0:09:16,000
they probably turned into synestias one or more times.

162
0:09:19.338,000 --> 0:09:24,000
A synestia gives us a new way to solve the problem of the origin of the Moon.

163
0:09:26.821,000 --> 0:09:32,000
We propose that the Moon formed inside a huge, vaporous synestia.

164
0:09:34.285,000 --> 0:09:37,000
The Moon grew from magma rain

165
0:09:37.379,000 --> 0:09:39,000
that condensed out of the rock vapor.

166
0:09:41.198,000 --> 0:09:43,000
The Moon's special connection to Earth

167
0:09:43.511,000 --> 0:09:45,000
is because the Moon formed inside the Earth

168
0:09:46.301,000 --> 0:09:47,000
when Earth was a synestia.

169
0:09:49.457,000 --> 0:09:53,000
The Moon could have orbited inside the synestia for years,

170
0:09:53.767,000 --> 0:09:54,000
hidden from view.

171
0:09:56.622,000 --> 0:10:,000
The Moon is revealed by the synestia cooling and shrinking

172
0:10:01.554,000 --> 0:10:02,000
inside of its orbit.

173
0:10:06.652,000 --> 0:10:08,000
The synestia turns into planet Earth

174
0:10:09.269,000 --> 0:10:12,000
only after cooling for hundreds of years longer.

175
0:10:14.99,000 --> 0:10:15,000
In our new theory,

176
0:10:16.818,000 --> 0:10:18,000
the giant impact makes a synestia,

177
0:10:19.652,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and the synestia divides into two new bodies,

178
0:10:23.321,000 --> 0:10:27,000
creating our isotopically identical Earth and Moon.

179
0:10:29.42,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Synestias have been created throughout the universe.

180
0:10:34.574,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And we only just realized that by finding them in our imagination:

181
0:10:40.179,000 --> 0:10:44,000
What else am I missing in the world around me?

182
0:10:45.106,000 --> 0:10:48,000
What is hidden from my view by my own assumptions?

183
0:10:51.371,000 --> 0:10:53,000
The next time you look at the Moon,

184
0:10:53.689,000 --> 0:10:54,000
remember:

185
0:10:55.372,000 --> 0:10:56,000
the things you think you know

186
0:10:58.32,000 --> 0:11:02,000
may be the opportunity to discover something truly amazing.

187
0:11:05.167,000 --> 0:11:09,000

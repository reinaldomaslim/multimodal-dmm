1
0:00:12.902,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I come to you today to speak of liars,

2
0:00:17.009,000 --> 0:00:18,000
lawsuits

3
0:00:18.456,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and laughter.

4
0:00:20.73,000 --> 0:00:23,000
The first time I heard about Holocaust denial,

5
0:00:23.864,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I laughed.

6
0:00:25.79,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Holocaust denial?

7
0:00:28.007,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The Holocaust which has the dubious distinction

8
0:00:31.461,000 --> 0:00:35,000
of being the best-documented genocide in the world?

9
0:00:36.866,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Who could believe it didn't happen?

10
0:00:39.926,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Think about it.

11
0:00:42.077,000 --> 0:00:44,000
For deniers to be right,

12
0:00:44.382,000 --> 0:00:45,000
who would have to be wrong?

13
0:00:46.831,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Well, first of all, the victims --

14
0:00:49.621,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the survivors who have told us their harrowing stories.

15
0:00:55.541,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Who else would have to be wrong?

16
0:00:57.879,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The bystanders.

17
0:00:59.856,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The people who lived in the myriads of towns and villages and cities

18
0:01:03.858,000 --> 0:01:04,000
on the Eastern front,

19
0:01:05.854,000 --> 0:01:07,000
who watched their neighbors be rounded up --

20
0:01:08.32,000 --> 0:01:11,000
men, women, children, young, old --

21
0:01:11.557,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and be marched to the outskirts of the town

22
0:01:14.301,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to be shot and left dead in ditches.

23
0:01:17.805,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Or the Poles,

24
0:01:19.159,000 --> 0:01:23,000
who lived in towns and villages around the death camps,

25
0:01:23.864,000 --> 0:01:25,000
who watched day after day

26
0:01:26.264,000 --> 0:01:28,000
as the trains went in filled with people

27
0:01:29.03,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and came out empty.

28
0:01:31.607,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But above all, who would have to be wrong?

29
0:01:35.825,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The perpetrators.

30
0:01:37.932,000 --> 0:01:39,000
The people who say, "We did it.

31
0:01:41.299,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I did it."

32
0:01:42.847,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Now, maybe they add a caveat.

33
0:01:45.02,000 --> 0:01:49,000
They say, "I didn't have a choice; I was forced to do it."

34
0:01:49.924,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But nonetheless, they say, "I did it."

35
0:01:53.758,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Think about it.

36
0:01:55.333,000 --> 0:02:,000
In not one war crimes trial since the end of World War II

37
0:02:01.296,000 --> 0:02:07,000
has a perpetrator of any nationality ever said, "It didn't happen."

38
0:02:08.898,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Again, they may have said, "I was forced," but never that it didn't happen.

39
0:02:13.504,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Having thought that through,

40
0:02:15.002,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I decided denial was not going to be on my agenda;

41
0:02:18.977,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I had bigger things to worry about, to write about, to research,

42
0:02:22.709,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and I moved on.

43
0:02:24.731,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Fast-forward a little over a decade,

44
0:02:27.574,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and two senior scholars --

45
0:02:29.41,000 --> 0:02:32,000
two of the most prominent historians of the Holocaust --

46
0:02:32.592,000 --> 0:02:33,000
approached me and said,

47
0:02:33.873,000 --> 0:02:34,000
"Deborah, let's have coffee.

48
0:02:35.686,000 --> 0:02:38,000
We have a research idea that we think is perfect for you."

49
0:02:39.307,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Intrigued and flattered that they came to me with an idea

50
0:02:43.164,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and thought me worthy of it,

51
0:02:44.765,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I asked, "What is it?"

52
0:02:47.485,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And they said, "Holocaust denial."

53
0:02:51.173,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And for the second time, I laughed.

54
0:02:54.156,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Holocaust denial?

55
0:02:56.104,000 --> 0:02:57,000
The Flat Earth folks?

56
0:02:58.114,000 --> 0:03:,000
The Elvis-is-alive people?

57
0:03:00.275,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I should study them?

58
0:03:03.146,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And these two guys said,

59
0:03:04.487,000 --> 0:03:05,000
"Yeah, we're intrigued.

60
0:03:06.832,000 --> 0:03:07,000
What are they about?

61
0:03:08.428,000 --> 0:03:09,000
What's their objective?

62
0:03:10.202,000 --> 0:03:13,000
How do they manage to get people to believe what they say?"

63
0:03:14.576,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So thinking, if they thought it was worthwhile,

64
0:03:18.128,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I would take a momentary diversion --

65
0:03:21.526,000 --> 0:03:23,000
maybe a year, maybe two, three, maybe even four --

66
0:03:24.488,000 --> 0:03:26,000
in academic terms, that's momentary.

67
0:03:26.757,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:27.923,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We work very slowly.

69
0:03:30.334,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:31.93,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And I would look at them.

71
0:03:33.756,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So I did.

72
0:03:34.935,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I did my research, and I came up with a number of things,

73
0:03:37.798,000 --> 0:03:39,000
two of which I'd like to share with you today.

74
0:03:40.415,000 --> 0:03:41,000
One:

75
0:03:41.772,000 --> 0:03:45,000
deniers are wolves in sheep's clothing.

76
0:03:47.532,000 --> 0:03:49,000
They are the same: Nazis, neo-Nazis --

77
0:03:50.521,000 --> 0:03:53,000
you can decide whether you want to put a "neo" there or not.

78
0:03:54.606,000 --> 0:03:56,000
But when I looked at them,

79
0:03:56.963,000 --> 0:04:,000
I didn't see any SS-like uniforms,

80
0:04:01.713,000 --> 0:04:04,000
swastika-like symbols on the wall,

81
0:04:04.888,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Sieg Heil salutes --

82
0:04:06.969,000 --> 0:04:07,000
none of that.

83
0:04:08.537,000 --> 0:04:1,000
What I found instead

84
0:04:11.431,000 --> 0:04:15,000
were people parading as respectable academics.

85
0:04:16.736,000 --> 0:04:17,000
What did they have?

86
0:04:17.981,000 --> 0:04:18,000
They had an institute.

87
0:04:19.703,000 --> 0:04:22,000
An "Institute for Historical Review."

88
0:04:24.212,000 --> 0:04:26,000
They had a journal -- a slick journal --

89
0:04:26.79,000 --> 0:04:28,000
a "Journal of Historical Review."

90
0:04:30.218,000 --> 0:04:32,000
One filled with papers --

91
0:04:32.948,000 --> 0:04:34,000
footnote-laden papers.

92
0:04:35.743,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And they had a new name.

93
0:04:38.32,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Not neo-Nazis,

94
0:04:40.512,000 --> 0:04:42,000
not anti-Semites --

95
0:04:43.026,000 --> 0:04:44,000
revisionists.

96
0:04:44.811,000 --> 0:04:46,000
They said, "We are revisionists.

97
0:04:47.05,000 --> 0:04:49,000
We are out to do one thing:

98
0:04:49.757,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to revise mistakes in history."

99
0:04:54.189,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But all you had to do was go one inch below the surface,

100
0:04:59.623,000 --> 0:05:,000
and what did you find there?

101
0:05:01.554,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The same adulation of Hitler,

102
0:05:04.068,000 --> 0:05:05,000
praise of the Third Reich,

103
0:05:05.967,000 --> 0:05:07,000
anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice.

104
0:05:09.724,000 --> 0:05:11,000
This is what intrigued me.

105
0:05:12.194,000 --> 0:05:18,000
It was anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice, parading as rational discourse.

106
0:05:20.55,000 --> 0:05:21,000
The other thing I found --

107
0:05:22.161,000 --> 0:05:25,000
many of us have been taught to think there are facts and there are opinions --

108
0:05:25.93,000 --> 0:05:26,000
after studying deniers,

109
0:05:27.41,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I think differently.

110
0:05:29.258,000 --> 0:05:3,000
There are facts,

111
0:05:30.93,000 --> 0:05:31,000
there are opinions,

112
0:05:32.668,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and there are lies.

113
0:05:34.969,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And what deniers want to do is take their lies,

114
0:05:40.385,000 --> 0:05:41,000
dress them up as opinions --

115
0:05:42.041,000 --> 0:05:43,000
maybe edgy opinions,

116
0:05:44.055,000 --> 0:05:46,000
maybe sort of out-of-the-box opinions --

117
0:05:46.788,000 --> 0:05:47,000
but then if they're opinions,

118
0:05:48.196,000 --> 0:05:5,000
they should be part of the conversation.

119
0:05:50.352,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And then they encroach on the facts.

120
0:05:55.125,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I published my work --

121
0:05:56.712,000 --> 0:05:57,000
the book was published,

122
0:05:57.91,000 --> 0:06:,000
"Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory,"

123
0:06:01.336,000 --> 0:06:02,000
it came out in many different countries,

124
0:06:03.316,000 --> 0:06:05,000
including here in Penguin UK,

125
0:06:05.5,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and I was done with those folks and ready to move on.

126
0:06:09.983,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Then came the letter from Penguin UK.

127
0:06:14.254,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And for the third time, I laughed ...

128
0:06:18.908,000 --> 0:06:19,000
mistakenly.

129
0:06:20.792,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I opened the letter,

130
0:06:22.546,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and it informed me that David Irving was bringing a libel suit against me

131
0:06:28.458,000 --> 0:06:29,000
in the United Kingdom

132
0:06:30.079,000 --> 0:06:33,000
for calling him a Holocaust denier.

133
0:06:33.773,000 --> 0:06:34,000
David Irving suing me?

134
0:06:35.731,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Who was David Irving?

135
0:06:36.959,000 --> 0:06:38,000
David Irving was a writer of historical works,

136
0:06:39.59,000 --> 0:06:41,000
most of them about World War II,

137
0:06:41.637,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and virtually all of those works took the position

138
0:06:44.88,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that the Nazis were really not so bad,

139
0:06:48.482,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and the Allies were really not so good.

140
0:06:51.59,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And the Jews, whatever happened to them,

141
0:06:53.719,000 --> 0:06:54,000
they sort of deserved it.

142
0:06:56.026,000 --> 0:06:57,000
He knew the documents,

143
0:06:57.541,000 --> 0:06:58,000
he knew the facts,

144
0:06:59.008,000 --> 0:07:02,000
but he somehow twisted them to get this opinion.

145
0:07:02.836,000 --> 0:07:04,000
He hadn't always been a Holocaust denier,

146
0:07:05.372,000 --> 0:07:06,000
but in the late '80s,

147
0:07:07.137,000 --> 0:07:09,000
he embraced it with great vigor.

148
0:07:11.337,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The reason I laughed also was this was a man

149
0:07:15.266,000 --> 0:07:16,000
who not only was a Holocaust denier,

150
0:07:17.224,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but seemed quite proud of it.

151
0:07:18.943,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Here was a man -- and I quote --

152
0:07:20.591,000 --> 0:07:23,000
who said, "I'm going to sink the battleship Auschwitz."

153
0:07:25.165,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Here was a man

154
0:07:26.361,000 --> 0:07:3,000
who pointed to the number tattooed on a survivor's arm and said,

155
0:07:31.536,000 --> 0:07:32,000
"How much money have you made

156
0:07:33.152,000 --> 0:07:36,000
from having that number tattooed on your arm?"

157
0:07:37.369,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Here was a man who said,

158
0:07:39.301,000 --> 0:07:41,000
"More people died in Senator Kennedy's car

159
0:07:42.281,000 --> 0:07:43,000
at Chappaquiddick

160
0:07:43.617,000 --> 0:07:46,000
than died in gas chambers at Auschwitz."

161
0:07:46.955,000 --> 0:07:48,000
That's an American reference, but you can look it up.

162
0:07:51.226,000 --> 0:07:54,000
This was not a man who seemed at all ashamed or reticent

163
0:07:54.264,000 --> 0:07:56,000
about being a Holocaust denier.

164
0:07:56.956,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Now, lots of my academic colleagues counseled me --

165
0:08:00.76,000 --> 0:08:01,000
"Eh, Deborah, just ignore it."

166
0:08:02.69,000 --> 0:08:05,000
When I explained you can't just ignore a libel suit,

167
0:08:06.302,000 --> 0:08:08,000
they said, "Who's going to believe him anyway?"

168
0:08:09.603,000 --> 0:08:11,000
But here was the problem:

169
0:08:11.707,000 --> 0:08:16,000
British law put the onus, put the burden of proof on me

170
0:08:17.039,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to prove the truth of what I said,

171
0:08:19.745,000 --> 0:08:21,000
in contrast to as it would have been in the United States

172
0:08:22.532,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and in many other countries:

173
0:08:24.06,000 --> 0:08:27,000
on him to prove the falsehood.

174
0:08:27.741,000 --> 0:08:28,000
What did that mean?

175
0:08:29.226,000 --> 0:08:32,000
That meant if I didn't fight,

176
0:08:32.626,000 --> 0:08:34,000
he would win by default.

177
0:08:35.611,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And if he won by default,

178
0:08:37.39,000 --> 0:08:39,000
he could then legitimately say,

179
0:08:40.055,000 --> 0:08:45,000
"My David Irving version of the Holocaust is a legitimate version.

180
0:08:45.415,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Deborah Lipstadt was found to have libeled me

181
0:08:47.623,000 --> 0:08:48,000
when she called me a Holocaust denier.

182
0:08:49.594,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Ipso facto, I, David Irving, am not a Holocaust denier."

183
0:08:54.046,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And what is that version?

184
0:08:56.251,000 --> 0:08:58,000
There was no plan to murder the Jews,

185
0:08:59.271,000 --> 0:09:01,000
there were no gas chambers,

186
0:09:01.347,000 --> 0:09:02,000
there were no mass shootings,

187
0:09:03.227,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Hitler had nothing to do with any suffering that went on,

188
0:09:06.422,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and the Jews have made this all up

189
0:09:10.251,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to get money from Germany

190
0:09:12.673,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and to get a state,

191
0:09:14.404,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and they've done it with the aid and abettance of the Allies --

192
0:09:17.805,000 --> 0:09:2,000
they've planted the documents and planted the evidence.

193
0:09:22.28,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I couldn't let that stand

194
0:09:24.684,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and ever face a survivor

195
0:09:27.643,000 --> 0:09:28,000
or a child of survivors.

196
0:09:29.642,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I couldn't let that stand

197
0:09:31.818,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and consider myself a responsible historian.

198
0:09:37.007,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So we fought.

199
0:09:38.776,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And for those of you who haven't seen "Denial,"

200
0:09:41.082,000 --> 0:09:42,000
spoiler alert:

201
0:09:42.265,000 --> 0:09:43,000
we won.

202
0:09:43.507,000 --> 0:09:44,000
(Laughter)

203
0:09:44.826,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Applause)

204
0:09:51.808,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The judge found David Irving

205
0:09:56.073,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to be a liar,

206
0:09:59.428,000 --> 0:10:,000
a racist,

207
0:10:00.615,000 --> 0:10:01,000
an anti-Semite.

208
0:10:01.893,000 --> 0:10:03,000
His view of history was tendentious,

209
0:10:04.277,000 --> 0:10:05,000
he lied, he distorted --

210
0:10:06.227,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and most importantly,

211
0:10:08.894,000 --> 0:10:1,000
he did it deliberately.

212
0:10:11.031,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We showed a pattern, in over 25 different major instances.

213
0:10:15.194,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Not small things -- many of us in this audience write books,

214
0:10:18.328,000 --> 0:10:19,000
are writing books;

215
0:10:19.537,000 --> 0:10:22,000
we always make mistakes, that's why we're glad to have second editions:

216
0:10:23.027,000 --> 0:10:24,000
correct the mistakes.

217
0:10:24.237,000 --> 0:10:25,000
(Laughter)

218
0:10:26.454,000 --> 0:10:29,000
But these always moved in the same direction:

219
0:10:30.438,000 --> 0:10:32,000
blame the Jews,

220
0:10:32.673,000 --> 0:10:34,000
exonerate the Nazis.

221
0:10:35.52,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But how did we win?

222
0:10:38.016,000 --> 0:10:43,000
What we did is follow his footnotes back to his sources.

223
0:10:44.01,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And what did we find?

224
0:10:45.817,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Not in most cases,

225
0:10:47.32,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and not in the preponderance of cases,

226
0:10:49.312,000 --> 0:10:53,000
but in every single instance where he made some reference to the Holocaust,

227
0:10:53.647,000 --> 0:10:57,000
that his supposed evidence was distorted,

228
0:10:57.913,000 --> 0:10:58,000
half-truth,

229
0:10:59.357,000 --> 0:11:,000
date-changed,

230
0:11:00.715,000 --> 0:11:02,000
sequence-changed,

231
0:11:02.926,000 --> 0:11:04,000
someone put at a meeting who wasn't there.

232
0:11:05.074,000 --> 0:11:07,000
In other words, he didn't have the evidence.

233
0:11:07.859,000 --> 0:11:09,000
His evidence didn't prove it.

234
0:11:09.992,000 --> 0:11:11,000
We didn't prove what happened.

235
0:11:13.448,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We proved that what he said happened --

236
0:11:15.971,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and by extension, all deniers, because he either quotes them

237
0:11:18.855,000 --> 0:11:2,000
or they get their arguments from him --

238
0:11:21.35,000 --> 0:11:22,000
is not true.

239
0:11:22.62,000 --> 0:11:23,000
What they claim --

240
0:11:23.833,000 --> 0:11:25,000
they don't have the evidence to prove it.

241
0:11:28.429,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So why is my story more than just the story

242
0:11:33.197,000 --> 0:11:36,000
of a quirky, long, six-year, difficult lawsuit,

243
0:11:37.028,000 --> 0:11:41,000
an American professor being dragged into a courtroom

244
0:11:42.041,000 --> 0:11:45,000
by a man that the court declared in its judgment

245
0:11:45.109,000 --> 0:11:47,000
was a neo-Nazi polemicist?

246
0:11:47.383,000 --> 0:11:48,000
What message does it have?

247
0:11:49.62,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I think in the context of the question of truth,

248
0:11:52.617,000 --> 0:11:54,000
it has a very significant message.

249
0:11:55.103,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Because today,

250
0:11:56.912,000 --> 0:11:57,000
as we well know,

251
0:11:58.602,000 --> 0:12:02,000
truth and facts are under assault.

252
0:12:03.522,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Social media, for all the gifts it has given us,

253
0:12:06.798,000 --> 0:12:11,000
has also allowed the difference between facts -- established facts --

254
0:12:12.403,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and lies

255
0:12:14.184,000 --> 0:12:15,000
to be flattened.

256
0:12:16.81,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Third of all:

257
0:12:18.344,000 --> 0:12:19,000
extremism.

258
0:12:20.807,000 --> 0:12:23,000
You may not see Ku Klux Klan robes,

259
0:12:24.408,000 --> 0:12:26,000
you may not see burning crosses,

260
0:12:26.503,000 --> 0:12:3,000
you may not even hear outright white supremacist language.

261
0:12:30.846,000 --> 0:12:34,000
It may go by names: "alt-right," "National Front" -- pick your names.

262
0:12:35.776,000 --> 0:12:4,000
But underneath, it's that same extremism that I found in Holocaust denial

263
0:12:41.635,000 --> 0:12:44,000
parading as rational discourse.

264
0:12:46.954,000 --> 0:12:51,000
We live in an age where truth is on the defensive.

265
0:12:52.195,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I'm reminded of a New Yorker cartoon.

266
0:12:54.703,000 --> 0:12:56,000
A quiz show recently appeared in "The New Yorker"

267
0:12:57.247,000 --> 0:13:,000
where the host of the quiz show is saying to one of the contestants,

268
0:13:00.493,000 --> 0:13:02,000
"Yes, ma'am, you had the right answer.

269
0:13:02.826,000 --> 0:13:04,000
But your opponent yelled more loudly than you did,

270
0:13:05.343,000 --> 0:13:06,000
so he gets the point."

271
0:13:08.048,000 --> 0:13:09,000
What can we do?

272
0:13:10.377,000 --> 0:13:11,000
First of all,

273
0:13:11.778,000 --> 0:13:16,000
we cannot be beguiled by rational appearances.

274
0:13:17.233,000 --> 0:13:18,000
We've got to look underneath,

275
0:13:19.026,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and we will find there the extremism.

276
0:13:22.811,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Second of all,

277
0:13:24.821,000 --> 0:13:3,000
we must understand that truth is not relative.

278
0:13:32.957,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Number three,

279
0:13:34.445,000 --> 0:13:37,000
we must go on the offensive,

280
0:13:38.158,000 --> 0:13:39,000
not the defensive.

281
0:13:40.496,000 --> 0:13:42,000
When someone makes an outrageous claim,

282
0:13:43.127,000 --> 0:13:46,000
even though they may hold one of the highest offices in the land,

283
0:13:46.655,000 --> 0:13:48,000
if not the world --

284
0:13:48.69,000 --> 0:13:49,000
we must say to them,

285
0:13:50.224,000 --> 0:13:51,000
"Where's the proof?

286
0:13:52.214,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Where's the evidence?"

287
0:13:54.375,000 --> 0:13:56,000
We must hold their feet to the fire.

288
0:13:57.326,000 --> 0:14:01,000
We must not treat it as if their lies are the same as the facts.

289
0:14:03.215,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And as I said earlier, truth is not relative.

290
0:14:06.779,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Many of us have grown up in the world of the academy

291
0:14:09.659,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and enlightened liberal thought,

292
0:14:11.424,000 --> 0:14:13,000
where we're taught everything is open to debate.

293
0:14:14.984,000 --> 0:14:16,000
But that's not the case.

294
0:14:17.022,000 --> 0:14:2,000
There are certain things that are true.

295
0:14:21.012,000 --> 0:14:24,000
There are indisputable facts --

296
0:14:24.056,000 --> 0:14:25,000
objective truths.

297
0:14:26.339,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Galileo taught it to us centuries ago.

298
0:14:31.18,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Even after being forced to recant by the Vatican

299
0:14:35.871,000 --> 0:14:37,000
that the Earth moved around the Sun,

300
0:14:38.468,000 --> 0:14:39,000
he came out,

301
0:14:39.646,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and what is he reported to have said?

302
0:14:41.98,000 --> 0:14:44,000
"And yet, it still moves."

303
0:14:47.162,000 --> 0:14:49,000
The Earth is not flat.

304
0:14:50.026,000 --> 0:14:52,000
The climate is changing.

305
0:14:53.207,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Elvis is not alive.

306
0:14:55.499,000 --> 0:14:56,000
(Laughter)

307
0:14:57.058,000 --> 0:14:59,000
(Applause)

308
0:14:59.398,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And most importantly,

309
0:15:01.723,000 --> 0:15:05,000
truth and fact are under assault.

310
0:15:07.109,000 --> 0:15:08,000
The job ahead of us,

311
0:15:08.743,000 --> 0:15:09,000
the task ahead of us,

312
0:15:09.97,000 --> 0:15:1,000
the challenge ahead of us

313
0:15:11.588,000 --> 0:15:12,000
is great.

314
0:15:13.567,000 --> 0:15:15,000
The time to fight is short.

315
0:15:17.061,000 --> 0:15:19,000
We must act now.

316
0:15:20.749,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Later will be too late.

317
0:15:24.018,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Thank you very much.

318
0:15:25.304,000 --> 0:15:29,000
(Applause)

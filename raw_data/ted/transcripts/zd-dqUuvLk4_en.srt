0:00:16.018,000 --> 0:00:19,000
We're going to begin in 1964.

3
0:00:19.309,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Bob Dylan is 23 years old, and his career

4
0:00:22.282,000 --> 0:00:24,000
is just reaching its pinnacle.

5
0:00:24.443,000 --> 0:00:26,000
He's been christened the voice of a generation,

6
0:00:26.884,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and he's churning out classic songs

7
0:00:29.344,000 --> 0:00:3,000
at a seemingly impossible rate,

8
0:00:31.307,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but there's a small minority of dissenters, and they claim

9
0:00:35.758,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that Bob Dylan is stealing other people's songs.

10
0:00:39.497,000 --> 0:00:43,000
2004. Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse,

11
0:00:43.637,000 --> 0:00:44,000
takes the Beatles' "White Album,"

12
0:00:45.55,000 --> 0:00:46,000
combines it with Jay-Z's "The Black Album"

13
0:00:47.327,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to create "The Grey Album."

14
0:00:49.151,000 --> 0:00:5,000
"The Grey Album" becomes an immediate sensation online,

15
0:00:51.07,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and the Beatles' record company sends out countless

16
0:00:53.83,000 --> 0:00:56,000
cease-and-desist letters for "unfair competition

17
0:00:57.07,000 --> 0:01:,000
and dilution of our valuable property."

18
0:01:00.951,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Now, "The Grey Album" is a remix.

19
0:01:02.943,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It is new media created from old media.

20
0:01:05.34,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It was made using these three techniques:

21
0:01:07.925,000 --> 0:01:1,000
copy, transform and combine.

22
0:01:11.167,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It's how you remix. You take existing songs,

23
0:01:13.089,000 --> 0:01:14,000
you chop them up, you transform the pieces,

24
0:01:14.809,000 --> 0:01:15,000
you combine them back together again,

25
0:01:16.649,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and you've got a new song, but that new song

26
0:01:18.626,000 --> 0:01:2,000
is clearly comprised of old songs.

27
0:01:21.36,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But I think these aren't just the components of remixing.

28
0:01:24.673,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I think these are the basic elements of all creativity.

29
0:01:27.717,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I think everything is a remix,

30
0:01:29.528,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and I think this is a better way to conceive of creativity.

31
0:01:34.219,000 --> 0:01:36,000
All right, let's head back to 1964, and let's hear

32
0:01:37.212,000 --> 0:01:4,000
where some of Dylan's early songs came from.

33
0:01:40.233,000 --> 0:01:41,000
We'll do some side-by-side comparisons here.

34
0:01:42.11,000 --> 0:01:43,000
All right, this first song you're going to hear

35
0:01:43.316,000 --> 0:01:45,000
is "Nottamun Town." It's a traditional folk tune.

36
0:01:45.73,000 --> 0:01:47,000
After that, you'll hear Dylan's "Masters of War."

37
0:01:48.318,000 --> 0:01:52,000

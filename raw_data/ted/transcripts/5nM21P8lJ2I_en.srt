1
0:00:12.1,000 --> 0:00:17,000
to empower girls you need to educate

2
0:00:14.719,000 --> 0:00:19,000
them that was my dream and so I built

3
0:00:18.08,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the school and in the process I learned

4
0:00:20.42,000 --> 0:00:25,000
something much bigger when you empower

5
0:00:22.699,000 --> 0:00:29,000
girl you transform a community school is

6
0:00:26.39,000 --> 0:00:33,000
just a stud I grew up in rural Kenya in

7
0:00:30.62,000 --> 0:00:35,000
a small village called Messiah I was the

8
0:00:33.559,000 --> 0:00:38,000
first of eight children and I spent my

9
0:00:36.05,000 --> 0:00:42,000
childhood helping my mother cook clean

10
0:00:38.93,000 --> 0:00:44,000
farm and take care of my siblings like

11
0:00:42.2,000 --> 0:00:48,000
other Maasai girls I was engaged from a

12
0:00:44.93,000 --> 0:00:5,000
very young age to be married but as I

13
0:00:48.739,000 --> 0:00:53,000
reached puberty I underwent through

14
0:00:51.02,000 --> 0:00:58,000
female genital mutilation all known as

15
0:00:54.59,000 --> 0:01:03,000
FGM this picture shows some of the tools

16
0:00:58.64,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that I used perform FGM on girls FGM was

17
0:01:04.009,000 --> 0:01:1,000
supposed to mark the end of my childhood

18
0:01:06.079,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and by extension my education but I

19
0:01:10.67,000 --> 0:01:14,000
negotiated with my father in order to

20
0:01:13.13,000 --> 0:01:2,000
stay in school even after going through

21
0:01:15.38,000 --> 0:01:24,000
our Chia yes later I went to university

22
0:01:20.39,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and in order to get my community support

23
0:01:24.979,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I promised to come back one day to repay

24
0:01:28.49,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that support but the years later when I

25
0:01:32.299,000 --> 0:01:37,000
went back to my village not much had

26
0:01:35.09,000 --> 0:01:41,000
changed girls were still going through

27
0:01:37.88,000 --> 0:01:43,000
FGM still living school still getting

28
0:01:41.75,000 --> 0:01:46,000
married to men older than their fathers

29
0:01:44.03,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and still having children liked it when

30
0:01:47.119,000 --> 0:01:53,000
when they're teenagers I did not want to

31
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
see anymore girl go through that that's

32
0:01:53.39,000 --> 0:01:57,000
when I knew what I needed to do to give

33
0:01:56.42,000 --> 0:02:02,000
back to my community

34
0:01:57.53,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I built a school just for girls so that

35
0:02:02.75,000 --> 0:02:09,000
they can be free from FGM and Ally

36
0:02:05.63,000 --> 0:02:09,000
marriage at my faster Roman

37
0:02:14.4,000 --> 0:02:23,000
at my first enrollment I had hoped for

38
0:02:17.92,000 --> 0:02:26,000
ten girls a hundred came I started to

39
0:02:24.28,000 --> 0:02:29,000
realize just how big this dream was and

40
0:02:26.92,000 --> 0:02:31,000
soon I learned that my school could be

41
0:02:30.19,000 --> 0:02:35,000
the foundation but it wasn't going to be

42
0:02:32.53,000 --> 0:02:38,000
enough so that first year I enrolled

43
0:02:35.59,000 --> 0:02:4,000
these thirty girls some had been abused

44
0:02:38.65,000 --> 0:02:42,000
other were orphans and some came from

45
0:02:40.93,000 --> 0:02:44,000
families that are very traditional that

46
0:02:42.91,000 --> 0:02:47,000
had never sent any girl to school so

47
0:02:45.79,000 --> 0:02:49,000
school started though the girl seems

48
0:02:48.519,000 --> 0:02:53,000
excited to be there they had they were

49
0:02:50.709,000 --> 0:02:56,000
having difficulty staying awake what was

50
0:02:54.25,000 --> 0:02:58,000
going on they had a teacher they had

51
0:02:56.709,000 --> 0:03:01,000
books there was a new classroom on the

52
0:02:58.48,000 --> 0:03:06,000
way but they were determined to be there

53
0:03:02.43,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but they had no energy then I realized

54
0:03:06.58,000 --> 0:03:12,000
they were hungry so I quickly found a

55
0:03:09.7,000 --> 0:03:15,000
cook and food soon thereafter I learned

56
0:03:13.299,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that a classroom was not enough I needed

57
0:03:16.39,000 --> 0:03:22,000
a boarding school not only girls were

58
0:03:19.84,000 --> 0:03:25,000
tired and hungry from chores and long

59
0:03:23.14,000 --> 0:03:29,000
walks to school and back home they were

60
0:03:25.93,000 --> 0:03:31,000
also not safe it's a sad truth but girls

61
0:03:29.89,000 --> 0:03:35,000
are often assaulted raped and even

62
0:03:32.89,000 --> 0:03:36,000
kidnapped on their way to school so

63
0:03:36.04,000 --> 0:03:38,000
before a girl could learn math or

64
0:03:37.81,000 --> 0:03:4,000
history

65
0:03:38.53,000 --> 0:03:44,000
she needed to feel safe she needed to be

66
0:03:41.56,000 --> 0:03:47,000
rested and be well nourished so let me

67
0:03:45.519,000 --> 0:03:5,000
tell you about some of my girls this is

68
0:03:47.799,000 --> 0:03:52,000
faith faith comes from a very

69
0:03:50.89,000 --> 0:03:54,000
traditional family in the community how

70
0:03:53.29,000 --> 0:03:57,000
older sister had already been going

71
0:03:55.39,000 --> 0:04:,000
through FGM and already marriage but

72
0:03:57.85,000 --> 0:04:01,000
faith was so determined she really loved

73
0:04:00.43,000 --> 0:04:03,000
learning and she wanted to come to

74
0:04:02.38,000 --> 0:04:06,000
school to my school when she had about

75
0:04:04.12,000 --> 0:04:1,000
it so she asked her father her mother

76
0:04:07.23,000 --> 0:04:13,000
anyone to bring her to my school they

77
0:04:10.15,000 --> 0:04:14,000
all refused faith did something very

78
0:04:14.079,000 --> 0:04:17,000
brave

79
0:04:14.769,000 --> 0:04:19,000
she stole an egg from her mother's house

80
0:04:17.65,000 --> 0:04:22,000
went to the market sold the egg and

81
0:04:20.32,000 --> 0:04:25,000
bought a single pencil then she walked

82
0:04:22.78,000 --> 0:04:26,000
five miles crunching that pencil trying

83
0:04:25.51,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to enroll

84
0:04:26.98,000 --> 0:04:35,000
she arrived she arrived tired and hungry

85
0:04:33.67,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but determined I listened to her story

86
0:04:36.94,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and we hand wrote that in my school but

87
0:04:39.94,000 --> 0:04:44,000
getting into my school was the only

88
0:04:41.8,000 --> 0:04:45,000
justice that faith needed food

89
0:04:44.95,000 --> 0:04:49,000
she needed medicine she needed

90
0:04:46.51,000 --> 0:04:52,000
counseling all which we provided and she

91
0:04:50.65,000 --> 0:04:54,000
also met adults who are ready and

92
0:04:52.87,000 --> 0:04:58,000
believed in her supported by this

93
0:04:55.54,000 --> 0:05:02,000
community faith was ready to learn this

94
0:04:59.47,000 --> 0:05:05,000
is faith six months of a schooling now

95
0:05:03.31,000 --> 0:05:08,000
she's a happiest explainer who dreams of

96
0:05:05.77,000 --> 0:05:11,000
becoming a pilot someday and her family

97
0:05:09.01,000 --> 0:05:14,000
now supports her and best of all her

98
0:05:12.49,000 --> 0:05:16,000
younger sisters will follow in her

99
0:05:14.5,000 --> 0:05:16,000
footsteps

100
0:05:22.27,000 --> 0:05:28,000
child marriage is expected to cost the

101
0:05:25.97,000 --> 0:05:29,000
global economy trillions of dollars over

102
0:05:28.46,000 --> 0:05:32,000
the next 15 years

103
0:05:30.02,000 --> 0:05:36,000
we can talk numbers but in real life

104
0:05:33.38,000 --> 0:05:39,000
time what child marriage will cost my

105
0:05:36.44,000 --> 0:05:42,000
village is the doctor the teacher the

106
0:05:40.22,000 --> 0:05:45,000
entrepreneur and the true partner our

107
0:05:42.56,000 --> 0:05:5,000
men will need in the future real ways

108
0:05:45.92,000 --> 0:05:54,000
women can help us lift out of poverty so

109
0:05:51.44,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I came to realize once again as I did

110
0:05:55.01,000 --> 0:06:,000
when I needed help to go to university

111
0:05:56.96,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that while I could dream or have a dream

112
0:06:00.11,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I could not make it come along true all

113
0:06:03.8,000 --> 0:06:09,000
by myself so I went back to the elders

114
0:06:08.24,000 --> 0:06:13,000
who helped me more than a decade ago I

115
0:06:10.22,000 --> 0:06:16,000
needed their support once again if I was

116
0:06:13.52,000 --> 0:06:18,000
going to be successful so I formed a

117
0:06:16.58,000 --> 0:06:21,000
community board with religious leaders

118
0:06:19.04,000 --> 0:06:24,000
parents and some part teachers from

119
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
other schools I needed allies in the

120
0:06:24.77,000 --> 0:06:28,000
government and I needed in and in the

121
0:06:26.84,000 --> 0:06:31,000
community to help advance my goal I

122
0:06:29.71,000 --> 0:06:34,000
needed especially the support of the

123
0:06:32.24,000 --> 0:06:37,000
chief to help me enforce the no FGM

124
0:06:34.97,000 --> 0:06:42,000
policy in my school at first he was

125
0:06:38.06,000 --> 0:06:46,000
resistant but I persisted and now is our

126
0:06:43.49,000 --> 0:06:46,000
greatest ally

127
0:06:49.81,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I also needed their fathers that brings

128
0:06:54.52,000 --> 0:06:59,000
me to Linette Linette father mabashi

129
0:06:58.66,000 --> 0:07:02,000
did not believe in the education of

130
0:07:00.19,000 --> 0:07:03,000
girls in fact he himself never went to

131
0:07:02.86,000 --> 0:07:04,000
school

132
0:07:03.34,000 --> 0:07:06,000
but the Nets mother believed in

133
0:07:05.5,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Lynette's and brought her to enroll in

134
0:07:07.09,000 --> 0:07:12,000
my school and they knew she belonged

135
0:07:08.68,000 --> 0:07:14,000
with us I just had to find a way to get

136
0:07:12.34,000 --> 0:07:18,000
mom or she to believe in Lynette's too

137
0:07:15.39,000 --> 0:07:21,000
so I used the pretense of revealed

138
0:07:18.73,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Lynette's great to get Lynn Moshe to

139
0:07:22.3,000 --> 0:07:27,000
come he came and he started noticing his

140
0:07:25.6,000 --> 0:07:29,000
daughter being promising as a student

141
0:07:27.9,000 --> 0:07:32,000
with each visit

142
0:07:29.71,000 --> 0:07:34,000
he clearly built a strong relationship

143
0:07:32.919,000 --> 0:07:37,000
with his daughter noticing not just her

144
0:07:35.29,000 --> 0:07:4,000
grades but also accepting her as someone

145
0:07:38.77,000 --> 0:07:43,000
with full potential

146
0:07:41.07,000 --> 0:07:45,000
so when the net was accepted in one of

147
0:07:43.84,000 --> 0:07:48,000
the top national high school after 8th

148
0:07:45.7,000 --> 0:07:5,000
grade mom or she was bursting with pride

149
0:07:49.24,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and went around the village telling

150
0:07:51.13,000 --> 0:07:56,000
everyone how you know proud and smart as

151
0:07:53.53,000 --> 0:07:58,000
his daughter was can you imagine he

152
0:07:56.83,000 --> 0:08:,000
brought Lynette to the new school

153
0:07:58.54,000 --> 0:08:04,000
himself it was the first time neither of

154
0:08:01.63,000 --> 0:08:07,000
them had ever been to Nairobi today

155
0:08:04.8,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Jeanette is studying at University in

156
0:08:07.63,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Australia

157
0:08:13.11,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and man washi is our greatest advocate

158
0:08:16.199,000 --> 0:08:2,000
in the community

159
0:08:17.4,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I also brought mothers to the table

160
0:08:20.789,000 --> 0:08:24,000
including my own that's my mother in one

161
0:08:23.31,000 --> 0:08:27,000
of our training programs and our mothers

162
0:08:25.65,000 --> 0:08:27,000
are involved in the education of their

163
0:08:27.479,000 --> 0:08:3,000
own children

164
0:08:28.379,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I also brought grandmothers into the mix

165
0:08:31.399,000 --> 0:08:36,000
in my community grandmother's are the

166
0:08:35.219,000 --> 0:08:39,000
proud keepers of our stories and

167
0:08:37.05,000 --> 0:08:43,000
cultures and I wanted my girls to learn

168
0:08:40.079,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and impress our rich Masai culture today

169
0:08:43.5,000 --> 0:08:47,000
grandmothers do story time with the

170
0:08:45.63,000 --> 0:08:52,000
girls and it's a beautiful way our

171
0:08:47.579,000 --> 0:08:56,000
community remains connected I also

172
0:08:53.269,000 --> 0:08:59,000
started working with the boys what would

173
0:08:56.79,000 --> 0:09:01,000
happen is the boys grew up with the same

174
0:08:59.91,000 --> 0:09:05,000
mindset as their fathers before them I

175
0:09:02.279,000 --> 0:09:08,000
will tell you not much will change so I

176
0:09:05.91,000 --> 0:09:1,000
enlisted support of an organization

177
0:09:08.61,000 --> 0:09:13,000
called I am what defending a group of

178
0:09:11.339,000 --> 0:09:15,000
young progressive leaders led by Alfred

179
0:09:13.86,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and George together we created a

180
0:09:16.29,000 --> 0:09:21,000
training programs for boys and girls who

181
0:09:19.079,000 --> 0:09:25,000
could not attend my school sharing vital

182
0:09:22.17,000 --> 0:09:29,000
information about gender equality health

183
0:09:25.89,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and human rights today we have reached

184
0:09:29.43,000 --> 0:09:34,000
over 10,000 boys and girls and Counting

185
0:09:40.1,000 --> 0:09:44,000
it's time so it truly does take a

186
0:09:43.199,000 --> 0:09:45,000
village to make this kind of a dream

187
0:09:44.85,000 --> 0:09:47,000
come true

188
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that's what we have seen today where

189
0:09:48.839,000 --> 0:09:53,000
nearly 400 girls have not been metal

190
0:09:51.629,000 --> 0:09:57,000
have not gone through FGM in my village

191
0:09:54.42,000 --> 0:10:02,000
in a region where nearly 80% of women

192
0:09:58.499,000 --> 0:10:05,000
have been cut believe me these girls

193
0:10:02.72,000 --> 0:10:08,000
they're sharing their experiences with

194
0:10:05.91,000 --> 0:10:12,000
their sisters their cousins and their

195
0:10:08.73,000 --> 0:10:15,000
friends they're so interested over time

196
0:10:13.62,000 --> 0:10:17,000
this is becoming the new normal and it's

197
0:10:16.019,000 --> 0:10:23,000
being embraced by the same same

198
0:10:18.149,000 --> 0:10:26,000
community my community so what does

199
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
transform communities means to Kenya

200
0:10:26.629,000 --> 0:10:32,000

201
0:10:29.939,000 --> 0:10:35,000

223
0:11:46.44,000 --> 0:11:52,000
aside and back again and in the process

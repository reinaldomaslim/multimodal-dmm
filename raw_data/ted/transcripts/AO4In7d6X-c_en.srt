1
0:00:19.085,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Laughter)

2
0:00:24.323,000 --> 0:00:25,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:36.71,000 --> 0:00:37,000
That's SpotMini.

4
0:00:37.884,000 --> 0:00:38,000
He'll be back in a little while.

5
0:00:39.526,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I --

6
0:00:40.714,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Applause)

7
0:00:45.472,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I love building robots.

8
0:00:48.419,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And my long-term goal is to build robots

9
0:00:50.895,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that can do what people and animals do.

10
0:00:53.964,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And there's three things in particular

11
0:00:57.541,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that we're interested in.

12
0:01:00.008,000 --> 0:01:03,000
One is balance and dynamic mobility,

13
0:01:03.334,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the second one is mobile manipulation,

14
0:01:05.988,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and the third one is mobile perception.

15
0:01:08.944,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So, dynamic mobility and balance --

16
0:01:11.879,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I'm going to do a demo for you.

17
0:01:15.099,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I'm standing here, balancing.

18
0:01:18.121,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I can see you're not very impressed. OK, how about now?

19
0:01:20.859,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:22.043,000 --> 0:01:23,000
How about now?

21
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Applause)

22
0:01:26.049,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Those simple capabilities mean that people can go almost anywhere on earth,

23
0:01:30.446,000 --> 0:01:31,000
on any kind of terrain.

24
0:01:32.122,000 --> 0:01:34,000
We want to capture that for robots.

25
0:01:35.772,000 --> 0:01:36,000
What about manipulation?

26
0:01:37.614,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I'm holding this clicker in my hand;

27
0:01:39.354,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I'm not even looking at it,

28
0:01:40.67,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and I can manipulate it without any problem.

29
0:01:43.424,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But even more important,

30
0:01:46.088,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I can move my body while I hold the manipulator, the clicker,

31
0:01:52.115,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and stabilize and coordinate my body,

32
0:01:54.313,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and I can even walk around.

33
0:01:56.367,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And that means I can move around in the world

34
0:01:59.289,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and expand the range of my arms and my hands

35
0:02:02.615,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and really be able to handle almost anything.

36
0:02:04.808,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So that's mobile manipulation.

37
0:02:07.454,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And all of you can do this.

38
0:02:09.253,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Third is perception.

39
0:02:11.194,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I'm looking at a room with over 1,000 people in it,

40
0:02:14.483,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and my amazing visual system can see every one of you --

41
0:02:19.282,000 --> 0:02:2,000
you're all stable in space,

42
0:02:21.267,000 --> 0:02:22,000
even when I move my head,

43
0:02:22.61,000 --> 0:02:23,000
even when I move around.

44
0:02:24.18,000 --> 0:02:27,000
That kind of mobile perception is really important for robots

45
0:02:27.983,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that are going to move and act

46
0:02:29.651,000 --> 0:02:3,000
out in the world.

47
0:02:31.865,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I'm going to give you a little status report

48
0:02:34.167,000 --> 0:02:37,000
on where we are in developing robots toward these ends.

49
0:02:40.338,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The first three robots are all dynamically stabilized robots.

50
0:02:44.902,000 --> 0:02:46,000
This one goes back a little over 10 years ago --

51
0:02:47.574,000 --> 0:02:48,000
"BigDog."

52
0:02:48.766,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It's got a gyroscope that helps stabilize it.

53
0:02:52.1,000 --> 0:02:55,000
It's got sensors and a control computer.

54
0:02:55.46,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Here's a Cheetah robot that's running with a galloping gait,

55
0:02:58.651,000 --> 0:02:59,000
where it recycles its energy,

56
0:03:00.371,000 --> 0:03:01,000
it bounces on the ground,

57
0:03:01.962,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and it's computing all the time

58
0:03:03.54,000 --> 0:03:05,000
in order to keep itself stabilized and propelled.

59
0:03:07.934,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And here's a bigger robot

60
0:03:09.786,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that's got such good locomotion using its legs,

61
0:03:12.515,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that it can go in deep snow.

62
0:03:13.943,000 --> 0:03:15,000
This is about 10 inches deep,

63
0:03:16.378,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and it doesn't really have any trouble.

64
0:03:20.166,000 --> 0:03:22,000
This is Spot, a new generation of robot --

65
0:03:22.819,000 --> 0:03:24,000
just slightly older than the one that came out onstage.

66
0:03:26.258,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And we've been asking the question --

67
0:03:28.114,000 --> 0:03:29,000
you've all heard about drone delivery:

68
0:03:30.112,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Can we deliver packages to your houses with drones?

69
0:03:32.759,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Well, what about plain old legged-robot delivery?

70
0:03:35.57,000 --> 0:03:36,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:36.726,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So we've been taking our robot to our employees' homes

72
0:03:40.147,000 --> 0:03:41,000
to see whether we could get in --

73
0:03:41.754,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:42.802,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the various access ways.

75
0:03:44.054,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And believe me, in the Boston area,

76
0:03:45.962,000 --> 0:03:48,000
there's every manner of stairway twists and turns.

77
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So it's a real challenge.

78
0:03:50.421,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But we're doing very well, about 70 percent of the way.

79
0:03:54.479,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And here's mobile manipulation,

80
0:03:56.068,000 --> 0:03:58,000
where we've put an arm on the robot,

81
0:03:58.683,000 --> 0:04:,000
and it's finding its way through the door.

82
0:04:01.742,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Now, one of the important things about making autonomous robots

83
0:04:04.925,000 --> 0:04:07,000
is to make them not do just exactly what you say,

84
0:04:08.169,000 --> 0:04:13,000
but make them deal with the uncertainty of what happens in the real world.

85
0:04:14.054,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So we have Steve there, one of the engineers,

86
0:04:17.089,000 --> 0:04:18,000
giving the robot a hard time.

87
0:04:18.721,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:19.777,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And the fact that the programming still tolerates all that disturbance --

89
0:04:23.991,000 --> 0:04:24,000
it does what it's supposed to.

90
0:04:25.512,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Here's another example, where Eric is tugging on the robot

91
0:04:28.327,000 --> 0:04:29,000
as it goes up the stairs.

92
0:04:29.649,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And believe me,

93
0:04:30.825,000 --> 0:04:33,000
getting it to do what it's supposed to do in those circumstances

94
0:04:34.121,000 --> 0:04:35,000
is a real challenge,

95
0:04:35.486,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but the result is something that's going to generalize

96
0:04:38.25,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and make robots much more autonomous than they would be otherwise.

97
0:04:43.317,000 --> 0:04:45,000
This is Atlas, a humanoid robot.

98
0:04:46.427,000 --> 0:04:49,000
It's a third-generation humanoid that we've been building.

99
0:04:50.671,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I'll tell you a little bit about the hardware design later.

100
0:04:53.513,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And we've been saying:

101
0:04:54.713,000 --> 0:04:58,000
How close to human levels of performance and speed could we get

102
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
in an ordinary task,

103
0:05:00.759,000 --> 0:05:02,000
like moving boxes around on a conveyor?

104
0:05:03.931,000 --> 0:05:08,000
We're getting up to about two-thirds of the speed that a human operates

105
0:05:09.261,000 --> 0:05:1,000
on average.

106
0:05:10.758,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And this robot is using both hands, it's using its body,

107
0:05:13.711,000 --> 0:05:14,000
it's stepping,

108
0:05:14.904,000 --> 0:05:16,000
so it's really an example of dynamic stability,

109
0:05:17.655,000 --> 0:05:18,000
mobile manipulation

110
0:05:19.058,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and mobile perception.

111
0:05:22.192,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Here --

112
0:05:23.905,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Laughter)

113
0:05:26.389,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We actually have two Atlases.

114
0:05:28.483,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Laughter)

115
0:05:30.198,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Now, everything doesn't go exactly the way it's supposed to.

116
0:05:33.618,000 --> 0:05:34,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:38.318,000 --> 0:05:39,000
(Laughter)

118
0:05:40.536,000 --> 0:05:41,000
(Laughter)

119
0:05:45.292,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And here's our latest robot, called "Handle."

120
0:05:48.457,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Handle is interesting, because it's sort of half like an animal,

121
0:05:52.599,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and it's half something else

122
0:05:54.937,000 --> 0:05:56,000
with these leg-like things and wheels.

123
0:05:58.141,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It's got its arms on in kind of a funny way,

124
0:06:01.191,000 --> 0:06:03,000
but it really does some remarkable things.

125
0:06:03.311,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It can carry 100 pounds.

126
0:06:06.666,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It's probably going to lift more than that,

127
0:06:08.749,000 --> 0:06:09,000
but so far we've done 100.

128
0:06:10.551,000 --> 0:06:12,000
It's got some pretty good rough-terrain capability,

129
0:06:13.011,000 --> 0:06:14,000
even though it has wheels.

130
0:06:17.881,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And Handle loves to put on a show.

131
0:06:20.686,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Laughter)

132
0:06:24.644,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Applause)

133
0:06:30.74,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I'm going to give you a little bit of robot religion.

134
0:06:34.356,000 --> 0:06:38,000
A lot of people think that a robot is a machine where there's a computer

135
0:06:38.709,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that's telling it what to do,

136
0:06:40.9,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and the computer is listening through its sensors.

137
0:06:44.349,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But that's really only half of the story.

138
0:06:46.777,000 --> 0:06:49,000
The real story is that the computer is on one side,

139
0:06:49.91,000 --> 0:06:5,000
making suggestions to the robot,

140
0:06:51.878,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and on the other side are the physics of the world.

141
0:06:54.778,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And that physics involves gravity, friction, bouncing into things.

142
0:07:00.238,000 --> 0:07:01,000
In order to have a successful robot,

143
0:07:02.097,000 --> 0:07:06,000
my religion is that you have to do a holistic design,

144
0:07:06.712,000 --> 0:07:09,000
where you're designing the software, the hardware and the behavior

145
0:07:10.289,000 --> 0:07:11,000
all at one time,

146
0:07:11.549,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and all these parts really intermesh and cooperate with each other.

147
0:07:15.275,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And when you get the perfect design, you get a real harmony

148
0:07:18.406,000 --> 0:07:2,000
between all those parts interacting with each other.

149
0:07:22.269,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So it's half software and half hardware,

150
0:07:24.553,000 --> 0:07:25,000
plus the behavior.

151
0:07:26.698,000 --> 0:07:29,000
We've done some work lately on the hardware, where we tried to go --

152
0:07:30.264,000 --> 0:07:32,000
the picture on the left is a conventional design,

153
0:07:32.765,000 --> 0:07:34,000
where you have parts that are all bolted together,

154
0:07:35.689,000 --> 0:07:37,000
conductors, tubes, connectors.

155
0:07:38.453,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And on the right is a more integrated thing;

156
0:07:40.526,000 --> 0:07:42,000
it's supposed to look like an anatomy drawing.

157
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Using the miracle of 3-D printing,

158
0:07:45.864,000 --> 0:07:47,000
we're starting to build parts of robots

159
0:07:48.525,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that look a lot more like the anatomy of an animal.

160
0:07:51.446,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So that's an upper-leg part that has hydraulic pathways --

161
0:07:54.814,000 --> 0:07:55,000
actuators, filters --

162
0:07:56.768,000 --> 0:07:58,000
all embedded, all printed as one piece,

163
0:07:59.172,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and the whole structure is developed

164
0:08:02.398,000 --> 0:08:05,000
with a knowledge of what the loads and behavior are going to be,

165
0:08:05.458,000 --> 0:08:07,000
which is available from data recorded from robots

166
0:08:08.385,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and simulations and things like that.

167
0:08:10.218,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So it's a data-driven hardware design.

168
0:08:13.547,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And using processes like that,

169
0:08:15.297,000 --> 0:08:17,000
not only the upper leg but some other things,

170
0:08:17.565,000 --> 0:08:22,000
we've gotten our robots to go from big, behemoth, bulky, slow, bad robots --

171
0:08:22.729,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that one on the right, weighing almost 400 pounds --

172
0:08:26.372,000 --> 0:08:29,000
down to the one in the middle which was just in the video,

173
0:08:29.505,000 --> 0:08:3,000
weighs about 190 pounds,

174
0:08:31.092,000 --> 0:08:32,000
just a little bit more than me,

175
0:08:32.813,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and we have a new one,

176
0:08:34.323,000 --> 0:08:36,000
which is working but I'm not going to show it to you yet,

177
0:08:37.089,000 --> 0:08:38,000
on the left,

178
0:08:38.275,000 --> 0:08:39,000
which weighs just 165 pounds,

179
0:08:39.943,000 --> 0:08:41,000
with all the same strength and capabilities.

180
0:08:42.233,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So these things are really getting better very quickly.

181
0:08:46.28,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So it's time for Spot to come back out,

182
0:08:49.566,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and we're going to demonstrate a little bit of mobility,

183
0:08:53.338,000 --> 0:08:54,000
dexterity and perception.

184
0:08:55.681,000 --> 0:08:58,000
This is Seth Davis, who's my robot wrangler today,

185
0:08:59.469,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and he's giving Spot some general direction

186
0:09:02.533,000 --> 0:09:03,000
by steering it around,

187
0:09:04.383,000 --> 0:09:07,000
but all the coordination of the legs and the sensors

188
0:09:07.478,000 --> 0:09:09,000
is done by the robot's computers on board.

189
0:09:10.543,000 --> 0:09:13,000
The robot can walk with a number of different gaits;

190
0:09:14.013,000 --> 0:09:16,000
it's got a gyro,

191
0:09:16.196,000 --> 0:09:17,000
or a solid-state gyro,

192
0:09:17.557,000 --> 0:09:18,000
an IMU on board.

193
0:09:19.442,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Obviously, it's got a battery, and things like that.

194
0:09:23.352,000 --> 0:09:25,000
One of the cool things about a legged robot is,

195
0:09:25.882,000 --> 0:09:26,000
it's omnidirectional.

196
0:09:27.355,000 --> 0:09:29,000
In addition to going forward, it can go sideways,

197
0:09:31.413,000 --> 0:09:32,000
it can turn in place.

198
0:09:36.482,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And this robot is a little bit of a show-off.

199
0:09:39.675,000 --> 0:09:4,000
It loves to use its dynamic gaits,

200
0:09:41.659,000 --> 0:09:42,000
like running --

201
0:09:42.841,000 --> 0:09:43,000
(Laughter)

202
0:09:43.909,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And it's got one more.

203
0:09:47.104,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Laughter)

204
0:09:49.858,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Now if it were really a show-off, it would be hopping on one foot,

205
0:09:53.118,000 --> 0:09:54,000
but, you know.

206
0:09:54.31,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Now, Spot has a set of cameras here, stereo cameras,

207
0:09:58.377,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and we have a feed up in the center.

208
0:10:00.591,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It's kind of dark out in the audience,

209
0:10:02.439,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but it's going to use those cameras in order to look at the terrain

210
0:10:05.683,000 --> 0:10:06,000
right in front of it,

211
0:10:06.88,000 --> 0:10:08,000
while it goes over these obstacles back here.

212
0:10:09.665,000 --> 0:10:12,000
For this demo, Seth is steering,

213
0:10:13.002,000 --> 0:10:15,000
but the robot's doing all its own terrain planning.

214
0:10:15.531,000 --> 0:10:16,000
This is a terrain map,

215
0:10:17.057,000 --> 0:10:22,000
where the data from the cameras is being developed in real time,

216
0:10:22.251,000 --> 0:10:25,000
showing the red spots, which are where it doesn't want to step,

217
0:10:25.512,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and the green spots are the good places.

218
0:10:27.527,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And here it's treating them like stepping-stones.

219
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So it's trying to stay up on the blocks,

220
0:10:32.779,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and it adjusts its stride,

221
0:10:34.076,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and there's a ton of planning

222
0:10:35.561,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that has to go into an operation like that,

223
0:10:37.826,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and it does all that planning in real time,

224
0:10:40.112,000 --> 0:10:42,000
where it adjusts the steps a little bit longer

225
0:10:42.566,000 --> 0:10:43,000
or a little bit shorter.

226
0:10:45.216,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Now we're going to change it into a different mode,

227
0:10:47.67,000 --> 0:10:5,000
where it's just going to treat the blocks like terrain

228
0:10:51.117,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and decide whether to step up or down

229
0:10:54.86,000 --> 0:10:55,000
as it goes.

230
0:10:57.085,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So this is using dynamic balance

231
0:11:00.078,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and mobile perception,

232
0:11:01.96,000 --> 0:11:06,000
because it has to coordinate what it sees along with how it's moving.

233
0:11:08.988,000 --> 0:11:12,000
The other thing Spot has is a robot arm.

234
0:11:14.337,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Some of you may see that as a head and a neck,

235
0:11:16.851,000 --> 0:11:17,000
but believe me, it's an arm.

236
0:11:18.46,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Seth is driving it around.

237
0:11:20.249,000 --> 0:11:23,000
He's actually driving the hand and the body is following.

238
0:11:24.041,000 --> 0:11:28,000
So the two are coordinated in the way I was talking about before --

239
0:11:28.198,000 --> 0:11:29,000
in the way people can do that.

240
0:11:30.086,000 --> 0:11:34,000
In fact, one of the cool things Spot can do we call, "chicken-head mode,"

241
0:11:34.753,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and it keeps its head in one place in space,

242
0:11:37.961,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and it moves its body all around.

243
0:11:40.553,000 --> 0:11:42,000
There's a variation of this that's called "twerking" --

244
0:11:43.179,000 --> 0:11:44,000
(Laughter)

245
0:11:44.219,000 --> 0:11:45,000
but we're not going to use that today.

246
0:11:46.066,000 --> 0:11:47,000
(Laughter)

247
0:11:47.161,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So, Spot: I'm feeling a little thirsty. Could you get me a soda?

248
0:11:51.293,000 --> 0:11:54,000
For this demo, Seth is not doing any driving.

249
0:11:55.09,000 --> 0:11:57,000
We have a LIDAR on the back of the robot,

250
0:11:57.227,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and it's using these props we've put on the stage

251
0:11:59.788,000 --> 0:12:,000
to localize itself.

252
0:12:01.205,000 --> 0:12:03,000
It's gone over to that location.

253
0:12:03.51,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Now it's using a camera that's in its hand

254
0:12:06.416,000 --> 0:12:07,000
to find the cup,

255
0:12:08.853,000 --> 0:12:09,000
picks it up --

256
0:12:10.132,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and again, Seth's not driving.

257
0:12:13.372,000 --> 0:12:16,000
We've planned out a path for it to go --

258
0:12:16.637,000 --> 0:12:18,000
it looked like it was going off the path --

259
0:12:18.768,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and now Seth's going to take over control again,

260
0:12:21.15,000 --> 0:12:24,000
because I'm a little bit chicken about having it do this by itself.

261
0:12:24.623,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Thank you, Spot.

262
0:12:28.231,000 --> 0:12:33,000
(Applause)

263
0:12:34.889,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So, Spot:

264
0:12:36.503,000 --> 0:12:39,000
How do you feel about having just finished your TED performance?

265
0:12:41.014,000 --> 0:12:43,000
(Laughter)

266
0:12:44.068,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Me, too!

267
0:12:45.244,000 --> 0:12:46,000
(Laughter)

268
0:12:46.3,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Thank you all,

269
0:12:48.14,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and thanks to the team at Boston Dynamics,

270
0:12:50.559,000 --> 0:12:52,000
who did all the hard work behind this.

271
0:12:52.697,000 --> 0:12:54,000
(Applause)

272
0:13:03.059,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Helen Walters: Marc, come back in the middle.

273
0:13:05.246,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Thank you so much.

274
0:13:06.424,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Come over here, I have questions.

275
0:13:08.543,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So, you mentioned the UPS and the package delivery.

276
0:13:11.982,000 --> 0:13:14,000
What are the other applications that you see for your robots?

277
0:13:15.943,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Marc Raibert: You know, I think that robots

278
0:13:17.994,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that have the capabilities I've been talking about

279
0:13:20.424,000 --> 0:13:21,000
are going to be incredibly useful.

280
0:13:22.108,000 --> 0:13:24,000
About a year ago, I went to Fukushima

281
0:13:24.629,000 --> 0:13:26,000
to see what the situation was there,

282
0:13:26.684,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and there's just a huge need

283
0:13:28.585,000 --> 0:13:31,000
for machines that can go into some of the dirty places

284
0:13:31.947,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and help remediate that.

285
0:13:34.528,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I think it won't be too long until we have robots like this in our homes,

286
0:13:39.151,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and one of the big needs is to take care of the aging

287
0:13:44.496,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and invalids.

288
0:13:45.886,000 --> 0:13:48,000
I think that it won't be too long till we're using robots

289
0:13:49.899,000 --> 0:13:51,000
to help take care of our parents,

290
0:13:52.385,000 --> 0:13:56,000
or probably more likely, have our children help take care of us.

291
0:13:57.721,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And there's a bunch of other things.

292
0:13:59.495,000 --> 0:14:,000
I think the sky's the limit.

293
0:14:00.885,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Many of the ideas we haven't thought of yet,

294
0:14:03.167,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and people like you will help us think of new applications.

295
0:14:06.786,000 --> 0:14:07,000
HW: So what about the dark side?

296
0:14:08.397,000 --> 0:14:09,000
What about the military?

297
0:14:10.254,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Are they interested?

298
0:14:12.441,000 --> 0:14:15,000
MR: Sure, the military has been a big funder of robotics.

299
0:14:16.099,000 --> 0:14:2,000
I don't think the military is the dark side myself,

300
0:14:20.325,000 --> 0:14:23,000
but I think, as with all advanced technology,

301
0:14:24.22,000 --> 0:14:26,000
it can be used for all kinds of things.

302
0:14:26.291,000 --> 0:14:27,000
HW: Awesome. Thank you so much.

303
0:14:27.956,000 --> 0:14:28,000
MR: OK, you're welcome.

304
0:14:29.385,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Thank you.

305
0:14:30.561,000 --> 0:14:31,000
(Applause)

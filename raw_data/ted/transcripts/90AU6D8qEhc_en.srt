0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
One of the biggest challenges in computer graphics

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
has been being able to create a photo-real,

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
digital human face.

4
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And one of the reasons it is so difficult is that, unlike aliens and dinosaurs,

5
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
we look at human faces every day.

6
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
They are very important to how we communicate with each other.

7
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
As a result, we're tuned in to the subtlest things

8
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering,

9
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
in order to believe whether these things are realistic.

10
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And what I'm going to do in the next five minutes

11
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
is take you through a process

12
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
where we tried to create a reasonably photo-realistic computer-generated face,

13
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
using some computer graphics technology we've developed,

14
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and also some collaborators at a company called Image Metrics.

15
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And we're going to try to do a photo-real face

16
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
of an actress named Emily O'Brien, who is right there.

17
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And that's actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face.

18
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
By the end of the talk, we're going to see it move.

19
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
The way that we did this is we tried to start with Emily herself,

20
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
who was gracious enough to come to our laboratory

21
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
in Marina Del Rey, and sit for a session in Light Stage 5.

22
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
This is a face-scanning sphere, with 156 white LEDs all around

23
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that allow us to photograph her

24
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
in a series of very controlled illumination conditions.

25
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And the lighting that we use these days looks something like this.

26
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
We shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds.

27
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And we basically capture enough information

28
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face,

29
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and different principle directions of light from the light stage,

30
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to figure out both the coarse-scale

31
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and the fine-scale detail of her face.

32
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
If we zoom in on this photograph right here,

33
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
we can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her,

34
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time

35
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to get a nice image of her facial texture.

36
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And in addition, we've actually used polarizers on all the lights --

37
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
just like polarized sunglasses can block

38
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
the glare off of the road,

39
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
polarizers can block the shine off of the skin,

40
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
so we don't get all those specular reflections to take this map.

41
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Now, if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit,

42
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
we can actually bring that specular reflection

43
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
of the skin back in,

44
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point.

45
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
If you take the difference between these two images here,

46
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
you can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light

47
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
of just the shine off of Emily's skin.

48
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I don't think any photograph like this had ever been taken

49
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
before we had done this.

50
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And this is very important light to capture,

51
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin.

52
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It doesn't get underneath the translucent

53
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
layers of the skin and blur out.

54
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And, as a result, it's a very good cue

55
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to the detailed shape of the skin-pore structure

56
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have,

57
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
the things that actually make us look like real humans.

58
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So, if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection,

59
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
we can go from a traditional face scan

60
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape,

61
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and augment it with information

62
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles.

63
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And, even more importantly,

64
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture,

65
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
we can shoot Emily

66
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
in just part of an afternoon,

67
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
in many different facial poses and facial expressions.

68
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So, here you can see her moving her eyes around, moving her mouth around.

69
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And these we're actually going to use to create a photo-real digital character.

70
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
If you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily,

71
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things

72
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
as it goes into different facial expressions.

73
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
You can see things. Not only the face shape changes,

74
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
but all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs.

75
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
You can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously

76
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
from stretched skin pores

77
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to the regular skin texture.

78
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
You can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there.

79
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
You can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down.

80
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that.

81
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
In addition to this kind of high-resolution geometry,

82
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
since it's all captured with cameras, we've got a great texture map to use for the face.

83
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination,

84
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the red and the green and the blue,

85
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
diffuse the light differently,

86
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer.

87
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Then, instead of looking like a plaster mannequin,

88
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
it actually looks like it's made out of living human flesh.

89
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And this is what we used

90
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
to give to the company Image Metrics

91
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to create a rigged, digital version of Emily.

92
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here.

93
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But they basically created a digital puppet of her,

94
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
where you can pull on these various strings,

95
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and it actually moves her face in ways that are

96
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
completely consistent with the scans that we took.

97
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And, in addition to the coarse-scale geometry,

98
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
they also used all of that detail

99
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to create a set of what are called "displacement maps"

100
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that animate as well.

101
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
These are the displacement maps here.

102
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates.

103
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So the next process was then to animate her.

104
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
We actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data.

105
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So, by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques,

106
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
they were able to drive the facial rig

107
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
with the computer-generated performance.

108
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So what you're going to see now, after this,

109
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
is a completely photo-real digital face.

110
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We can turn the volume up a little bit if that's available.

111
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Emily: Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company.

112
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We specialize in high-quality facial animation

113
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
for video games and films.

114
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company.

115
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We specialize in high quality facial animation

116
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
for video games and films.

117
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Paul Debevec: So, if we break that down into layers, here's that diffuse component

118
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
we saw in the first slide.

119
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Here is the specular component animating.

120
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
You can see all the wrinkles happening there.

121
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And there is the underlying wireframe mesh.

122
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And that is Emily herself.

123
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Now, where are we going with this here?

124
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We've gone a little bit beyond Light Stage 5. This is Light Stage 6,

125
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and we're looking at taking this technology

126
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and applying it to whole human bodies.

127
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
This is Bruce Lawmen, one of our researchers in the group,

128
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
who graciously agreed to get captured running in the Light Stage.

129
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And let's take a look at a computer-generated version

130
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
of Bruce, running in a new environment.

131
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And thank you very much.

132
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Applause)

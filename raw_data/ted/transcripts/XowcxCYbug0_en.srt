1
0:00:12.869,000 --> 0:00:16,000
The way we tell stories has naturally changed

2
0:00:17.583,000 --> 0:00:2,000
since Aristotle defined the rules of tragedy

3
0:00:20.748,000 --> 0:00:22,000
about 2,500 years ago.

4
0:00:24.264,000 --> 0:00:26,000
According to him,

5
0:00:26.32,000 --> 0:00:31,000
the role of storytelling is to mimic life and make us feel emotions.

6
0:00:32.015,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And that's exactly what storytelling as we know it

7
0:00:35.549,000 --> 0:00:36,000
has done very well since then.

8
0:00:38.053,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But there is a dimension of life

9
0:00:41.102,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that storytelling could never really reproduce.

10
0:00:44.875,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It is the notion of choices.

11
0:00:48.385,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Choices are a very important part of our lives.

12
0:00:51.176,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We as individuals are defined by the choices we make.

13
0:00:55.854,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Some of our decisions can have very significant consequences

14
0:00:59.959,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and totally change the courses of our lives.

15
0:01:03.433,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But in a play, a novel or a film,

16
0:01:07.135,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the writer makes all the decisions in advance for the characters,

17
0:01:11.287,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and as the audience,

18
0:01:13.19,000 --> 0:01:15,000
we can only watch, passively,

19
0:01:15.868,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the consequences of his decisions.

20
0:01:19.518,000 --> 0:01:22,000
As a storyteller, I've always been fascinated

21
0:01:23.328,000 --> 0:01:28,000
with the idea of recreating this notion of choices in fiction.

22
0:01:29.157,000 --> 0:01:34,000
My dream was to put the audience in the shoes of the main protagonists,

23
0:01:34.806,000 --> 0:01:35,000
let them make their own decisions,

24
0:01:36.571,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and by doing so, let them tell their own stories.

25
0:01:42.811,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Finding a way to achieve this is what I did in the past 20 years of my life.

26
0:01:49.512,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Today, I would like to introduce you to this new way of telling stories,

27
0:01:54.73,000 --> 0:01:57,000
a way that has interactivity at its heart.

28
0:01:59.133,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Rather than exposing the theory behind it,

29
0:02:03.04,000 --> 0:02:06,000
which could have been kind of abstract and probably a little bit boring,

30
0:02:07.026,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I thought it would be a great opportunity to do a little experiment.

31
0:02:13.684,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I would like you, the people here at TED,

32
0:02:18.201,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to tell your own story.

33
0:02:22.319,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So I came with an interactive scene that we are going to play together.

34
0:02:27.605,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I've asked Vicky --

35
0:02:29.521,000 --> 0:02:3,000
hello, Vicky --

36
0:02:30.937,000 --> 0:02:32,000
to control the main character for us.

37
0:02:33.435,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And your role -- you, the audience --

38
0:02:37.482,000 --> 0:02:39,000
will be to make the choices.

39
0:02:40.929,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So Vicky and I don't know what's going to happen,

40
0:02:43.334,000 --> 0:02:46,000
because it will all be based on your decisions.

41
0:02:48.454,000 --> 0:02:54,000
This scene comes from our next game, called "Detroit: Become Human,"

42
0:02:54.8,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and we are in the near future,

43
0:02:58.376,000 --> 0:03:,000
where technology made possible the creation of androids

44
0:03:01.11,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that look exactly like human beings.

45
0:03:03.434,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We are in the shoes of this character called Connor,

46
0:03:06.643,000 --> 0:03:07,000
who is an android,

47
0:03:07.819,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and he can do very fancy things with coins, as you can see.

48
0:03:11.057,000 --> 0:03:13,000
He has this blue triangle on this chest,

49
0:03:15.056,000 --> 0:03:17,000
as all androids do,

50
0:03:18.744,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and now Vicky is in control of this character.

51
0:03:21.532,000 --> 0:03:24,000
She can walk around, she can go anywhere, she can look around,

52
0:03:25.11,000 --> 0:03:26,000
she can interact with her environment,

53
0:03:27.1,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and now she can tell her own stories by making choices.

54
0:03:29.918,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So here we have our first choice.

55
0:03:32.334,000 --> 0:03:33,000
There is a fish on the ground.

56
0:03:34.297,000 --> 0:03:35,000
What should we do?

57
0:03:35.487,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Should we save it or should we leave it?

58
0:03:37.529,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Remember, we are under time pressure,

59
0:03:39.526,000 --> 0:03:4,000
so we'd better be fast.

60
0:03:40.945,000 --> 0:03:41,000
What should we do?

61
0:03:42.142,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Audience: Save it!

62
0:03:43.332,000 --> 0:03:44,000
David Cage: Save it? Save the fish?

63
0:03:49.808,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Video) (Fish plops)

64
0:03:50.982,000 --> 0:03:51,000
DC: There we go.

65
0:03:53.788,000 --> 0:03:55,000
OK, we have an android who likes animals.

66
0:03:56.026,000 --> 0:03:57,000
OK, let's move on.

67
0:03:57.264,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Remember, we have a hostage situation.

68
0:03:59.804,000 --> 0:04:02,000
(Video) Woman: Please, please, you've got to save my little girl!

69
0:04:03.305,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Wait -- you're sending an android?

70
0:04:06.972,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Officer: All right, ma'am, you need to go.

71
0:04:09.028,000 --> 0:04:11,000
W: You can't do that!

72
0:04:11.371,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Why aren't you sending a real person?

73
0:04:14.531,000 --> 0:04:15,000
DC: OK, she's not really happy.

74
0:04:16.358,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Her daughter's been taken hostage by an android,

75
0:04:18.888,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and of course, she's in a state of shock.

76
0:04:21.104,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Now we can continue to explore this apartment.

77
0:04:23.43,000 --> 0:04:25,000
We see all the SWAT forces in place.

78
0:04:26.132,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But we need to find this Captain Allen first.

79
0:04:28.272,000 --> 0:04:29,000
That's the first thing we need to do.

80
0:04:30.077,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So, again, we can go anywhere.

81
0:04:32.793,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Vicky's still in control of the character.

82
0:04:34.972,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Let's see -- oh, I think this is Captain Allen. He's on the phone.

83
0:04:39.735,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Video) Connor: Captain Allen, my name is Connor.

84
0:04:42.278,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I'm the android sent by CyberLife.

85
0:04:47.227,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Captain Allen: Let's fire at everything that moves.

86
0:04:49.682,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It already shot down two of my men.

87
0:04:52.089,000 --> 0:04:55,000
We could easily get it, but they're on the edge of the balcony --

88
0:04:55.235,000 --> 0:04:56,000
it if falls,

89
0:04:56.444,000 --> 0:04:57,000
she falls.

90
0:04:57.673,000 --> 0:05:,000
DC: OK, now we need to decide what we want to ask the captain.

91
0:05:00.967,000 --> 0:05:01,000
What should be our choice?

92
0:05:02.235,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Deviant's name? Deviant's behavior? Emotional shock?

93
0:05:05.59,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Video) C: Has it experienced an emotional shock recently?

94
0:05:09.222,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Capt A: I haven't got a clue. Does it matter?

95
0:05:11.469,000 --> 0:05:13,000
C: I need information to determine the best approach.

96
0:05:14.654,000 --> 0:05:16,000
DC: OK, a second choice. Maybe we can learn something.

97
0:05:17.41,000 --> 0:05:18,000
What should we choose?

98
0:05:18.587,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Audience: Behavior.

99
0:05:19.782,000 --> 0:05:2,000
DC: OK, deviant behavior, Vicky.

100
0:05:21.359,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Video) C: Do you know if it's been behaving strangely before this?

101
0:05:24.553,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Capt A: Listen ... saving that kid is all that matters.

102
0:05:29.054,000 --> 0:05:31,000
DC: OK, we are not going to learn anything from this guy.

103
0:05:31.833,000 --> 0:05:32,000
We need to do something.

104
0:05:33.41,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Let's try to go back in the lobby.

105
0:05:37.806,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Oh, wait -- there's a room over there on your right, Vicky, I think.

106
0:05:41.412,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Maybe there's something we can learn here.

107
0:05:44.015,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Oh, there's a tablet.

108
0:05:46.012,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Let's have a look.

109
0:05:53.842,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Video) Girl: This is Daniel, the coolest android in the world.

110
0:05:57.153,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Say "Hi," Daniel.

111
0:05:58.568,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Daniel: Hello!

112
0:05:59.747,000 --> 0:06:01,000
G: You're my bestie, we'll always be together!

113
0:06:02.855,000 --> 0:06:04,000
DC: That was just one way of playing the scenes,

114
0:06:05.118,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but there are many other ways of playing it.

115
0:06:07.818,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Depending on the choices you make,

116
0:06:09.469,000 --> 0:06:11,000
we could have seen many different actions,

117
0:06:11.542,000 --> 0:06:12,000
many different consequences,

118
0:06:13.324,000 --> 0:06:15,000
many different outcomes.

119
0:06:15.851,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So that gives you an idea of what my work is about as an interactive writer.

120
0:06:19.842,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Where a linear writer needs to deal with time and space,

121
0:06:24.191,000 --> 0:06:25,000
as an interactive writer,

122
0:06:25.696,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I need to deal with time, space and possibilities.

123
0:06:30.269,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I have to manage massive tree structures,

124
0:06:35.107,000 --> 0:06:38,000
where each branch is a new variation of the story.

125
0:06:38.501,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I need to think about all the possibilities in a given scene

126
0:06:41.368,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and try to imagine everything that can happen.

127
0:06:43.657,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I need to deal with thousands and thousands of variables,

128
0:06:48.552,000 --> 0:06:5,000
conditions and possibilities.

129
0:06:50.771,000 --> 0:06:54,000
As a consequence, where a film script is about 100 pages,

130
0:06:55.969,000 --> 0:07:01,000
an interactive script like this is between four and five thousand pages.

131
0:07:03.319,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So that gives you an idea of what this work is about.

132
0:07:07.509,000 --> 0:07:12,000
But I think, in the end, the experience is very unique,

133
0:07:12.964,000 --> 0:07:16,000
because it is the result of the collaboration

134
0:07:17.116,000 --> 0:07:2,000
between a writer creating this narrative landscape

135
0:07:22.326,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and the player making his own decisions,

136
0:07:24.257,000 --> 0:07:28,000
telling his own story and becoming the cowriter

137
0:07:28.491,000 --> 0:07:31,000
but also the coactor and the codirector of the story.

138
0:07:34.772,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Interactive storytelling is a revolution in the way we tell stories.

139
0:07:39.997,000 --> 0:07:43,000
With the emergence of new platforms like interactive television,

140
0:07:44.824,000 --> 0:07:45,000
virtual reality and video games,

141
0:07:46.681,000 --> 0:07:48,000
it can become a new form of entertainment

142
0:07:48.938,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and maybe even a new form of art.

143
0:07:53.427,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I am convinced that in the coming years,

144
0:07:56.154,000 --> 0:08:02,000
we will see more and more moving and meaningful interactive experiences,

145
0:08:02.863,000 --> 0:08:04,000
created by a new generation of talents.

146
0:08:06.129,000 --> 0:08:08,000
This is a medium waiting for its Orson Welles

147
0:08:09.11,000 --> 0:08:1,000
or its Stanley Kubrick,

148
0:08:10.906,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and I have no doubt that they will soon emerge

149
0:08:14.894,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and be recognized as such.

150
0:08:18.231,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I believe that interactive storytelling can be

151
0:08:21.131,000 --> 0:08:23,000
what cinema was in the 20th century:

152
0:08:24.479,000 --> 0:08:27,000
an art that deeply changes its time.

153
0:08:28.676,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Thank you.

154
0:08:29.858,000 --> 0:08:31,000
(Applause)

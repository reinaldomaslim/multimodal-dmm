1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I don't know what the hell I'm doing here.

2
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I was born in a Scots Presbyterian ghetto in Canada,

3
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and dropped out of high school. I don't own a cell phone,

4
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and I paint on paper using gouache, which hasn't changed in 600 years.

5
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But about three years ago I had an art show in New York,

6
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and I titled it "Serious Nonsense."

7
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So I think I'm actually the first one here -- I lead.

8
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I called it "Serious Nonsense" because on the serious side,

9
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration

10
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
from when I was a kid. I copied it and I never unlearned it --

11
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
it's the only style I know. And it's very kind of staid and formal.

12
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And meanwhile, I use nonsense, as you can see.

13
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
This is a Scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors,

14
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor --

15
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
which you can't see there.

16
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
This was one of a series called "Zany Afternoons," which became a book.

17
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
This is a home-built rocket-propelled car. That's a 1953 Henry J --

18
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I'm a bug for authenticity -- in a quiet neighborhood in Toledo.

19
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
This is my submission for the L.A. Museum of Film.

20
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
You can probably tell Frank Gehry and I come from the same town.

21
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
My work is so personal and so strange

22
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that I have to invent my own lexicon for it.

23
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And I work a lot in what I call "retrofuturism,"

24
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow.

25
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And they're always wrong, always hilariously, optimistically wrong.

26
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And the peak time for that was the 30s,

27
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
because the Depression was so dismal

28
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that anything to get away from the present into the future ...

29
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and technology was going to carry us along.

30
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
This is Popular Workbench. Popular science magazines in those days --

31
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I had a huge collection of them from the '30s --

32
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses

33
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
out of wire coat hangers and everything improvised

34
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots

35
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
playing ice hockey at 300 miles an hour --

36
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
it's all going to happen, it's all going to be wonderful.

37
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Automotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties.

38
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter,

39
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
so I have a lot of revenge to take on the subject.

40
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Detroit has always been halfway into the future -- the advertising half.

41
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
This is the '58 Bulgemobile: so new, they make tomorrow look like yesterday.

42
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
This is a chain gang of guys admiring the car.

43
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
That's from a whole catalog -- it's 18 pages or so --

44
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
ran back in the days of the Lampoon, where I cut my teeth.

45
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Techno-archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened --

46
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
for good reason, usually.

47
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The zeppelin -- this was from a brochure about the zeppelin

48
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
based, obviously, on the Hindenburg.

49
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man.

50
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And it carried 56 people at the speed of a Buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark,

51
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and it cost twice as much as a first-class cabin on the Normandie to fly it.

52
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So the Hindenburg wasn't, you know, it was inevitable it was going to go.

53
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
This is auto-gyro jousting in Malibu in the 30s.

54
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
The auto-gyro couldn't wait for the invention of the helicopter,

55
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but it should have -- it wasn't a big success.

56
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It's the only Spanish innovation, technologically, of the 20th century, by the way.

57
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
You needed to know that.

58
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The flying car which never got off the ground -- it was a post-war dream.

59
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
My old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car.

60
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
This is pitched into the future from 1946,

61
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
looking at the day all American families have them.

62
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
"There's Moscow, Shirley. Hope they speak Esperanto!"

63
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Faux-nostalgia, which I'm sort of -- not, say, famous for, but I work an awful lot in it.

64
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It's the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened.

65
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Somebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion --

66
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
so I think that’s a case for serious play.

67
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
This is emblematic of it -- this is wing dining,

68
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over France in the 20s,

69
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
dining on the wing of a plane. You can't see it very well here,

70
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
but that's Hemingway reading some pages from his new novel

71
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to Fitzgerald and Ford Madox Ford until the slipstream blows him away.

72
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
This is tank polo in the South Hamptons.

73
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
The brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody. I do a lot of that.

74
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense.

75
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I think it adds a huge amount.

76
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Those, for example, are Mark IV British tanks from 1916.

77
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
They had two machine guns and a cannon,

78
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and they had 90 horsepower Ricardo engines.

79
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
They went five miles an hour and inside it was 105 degrees in the pitch dark.

80
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And they had a canary hung inside the thing

81
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to make sure the Germans weren't going to use gas.

82
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Happy little story, isn't it?

83
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
This is Motor Ritz Towers in Manhattan in the 30s,

84
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
where you drove up to your front door, if you had the guts.

85
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Anybody who was anybody had an apartment there.

86
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm.

87
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And I love cigars -- there's a cigar billboard down there.

88
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And faux-nostalgia works even in serious subjects like war.

89
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
This is those wonderful days of the Battle of Britain in 1940,

90
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
when a Messerschmitt ME109 bursts into the House of Commons

91
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and buzzes around, just to piss off Churchill, who's down there somewhere.

92
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It's a fond memory of times past.

93
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit,

94
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
just for the fun of it. This was a piece I did -- a brochure again --

95
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
"RMS Tyrannic: The Biggest Thing in All the World."

96
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
The copy, which you can't see because it goes on and on for several pages,

97
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
says that steerage passengers can't get their to bunks before the voyage is over,

98
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and it's so safe it carries no insurance.

99
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It's obviously modeled on the Titanic.

100
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But it's not a cri de coeur about man's hubris in the face of the elements.

101
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It's just a sick, silly joke.

102
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Shamelessly cheap is something, I think -- this will wake you up.

103
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
It has no meaning, just -- Desoto discovers the Mississippi,

104
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and it's a Desoto discovering the Mississippi.

105
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I did that as a quick back page -- I had like four hours to do a back page

106
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
for an issue of the Lampoon, and I did that,

107
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and I thought, "Well, I'm ashamed. I hope nobody knows it."

108
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
People wrote in for reprints of that thing.

109
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Urban absurdism -- that's what the New Yorker really calls for.

110
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I try to make life in New York look even weirder than it is with those covers.

111
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I've done about 40 of them, and I'd say 30 of them are based on that concept.

112
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I was driving down 7th Avenue one night at 3 a.m.,

113
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and this steam pouring out of the street, and I thought, "What causes that?" And that --

114
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
who’s to say?

115
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
The Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan in New York -- it's a very somber place.

116
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I thought I could jazz it up a bit, have a little fun with it.

117
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
This is a very un-PC cover. Not in New York.

118
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I couldn't resist, and I got a nasty email from some environmental group saying,

119
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
"This is too serious and solemn to make fun of. You should be ashamed,

120
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
please apologize on our website."

121
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Haven't got around to it yet but -- I may.

122
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
This is the word side of my brain.

123
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
(Laughter)

124
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I love the word "Eurotrash."

125
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Laughter)

126
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
That's all the Eurotrash coming through JFK customs.

127
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
This was the New York bike messenger meeting the Tour de France.

128
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
If you live in New York, you know how the bike messengers move.

129
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Except that he's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff -- they all do --

130
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist

131
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
about to shoot rockets at the Tour de France --

132
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
sign of our times, I guess.

133
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
This is the only fashion cover I've ever done.

134
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
It's the little old lady that lives in a shoe, and then this thing --

135
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
the title of that was, "There Goes the Neighborhood."

136
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I don't know a hell of a lot about fashion --

137
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I was told to do what they call a Mary Jane,

138
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and then I got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying:

139
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
"Put a strap on it" -- "No, don't put a strap on it" -- "Put a strap on it -- "Don't put a strap on it" --

140
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
because it obscures the logo and looks terrible and it's bad and --

141
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I finally chickened out and did it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe.

142
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
This is a tiny joke -- E-ZR pass. One letter makes an idea.

143
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
This is a big joke.

144
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
This is the audition for "King Kong."

145
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Laughter)

146
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
People always ask me, where do you get your ideas, how do your ideas come?

147
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Truth about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover,

148
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
in the middle of the night, this came to me like a Xerox -- all I had to do was write it down.

149
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It was perfectly clear. I didn't do any thinking about it.

150
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And then when it ran, a lovely lady, an old lady named Mrs. Edgar Rosenberg --

151
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
if you know that name -- called me and said she loved the cover, it was so sweet.

152
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Her former name was Fay Wray, and so that was --

153
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I didn't have the wit to say, "Take the painting."

154
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Finally, this was a three-page cover, never done before,

155
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and I don't think it will ever be done again --

156
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
successive pages in the front of the magazine.

157
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
It's the ascent of man using an escalator, and it's in three parts.

158
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
You can't see it all together, unfortunately, but if you look at it enough,

159
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move.

160
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
(Applause)

161
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Pretty elegant. Nothing like a crash to end a joke. That completes my oeuvre.

162
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I would just like to add a crass commercial --

163
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I have a kids' book coming out in the fall called "Marvel Sandwiches,"

164
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
a compendium of all the serious play that ever was,

165
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and it’s going to be available in fine bookstores, crummy bookstores,

166
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
tables on the street in October.

167
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So thank you very much.

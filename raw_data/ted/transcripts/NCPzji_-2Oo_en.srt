0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
About a year and a half ago,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Stephen Lawler, who also gave a talk

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
which is Microsoft's online-mapping effort.

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
In the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
on redefining the way maps work online.

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And we really are seeing this in very different terms

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
from the kind of mapping and direction site

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that one is used to.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
So, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning,

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
which, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon,

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that's where it comes from.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Mapping is, of course,

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
not just about cartography,

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
it's also about imagery.

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So, as we zoom-in beyond a certain level

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
virtual view at 45 degrees.

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to show you the 3D structure of the city, all the facades.

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now, we see this space, this three-dimensional environment,

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
as being a canvas on which

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
all sorts of applications can play out,

26
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and map's directions are really just one of them.

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
If you click on this, you'll see

28
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
some of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months

29
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
since we've launched.

30
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So, for example, a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti,

31
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
we had an earthquake map that showed

32
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
before and after pictures from the sky.

33
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you

34
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
is taking hyper-local blogs in real time

35
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and mapping those stories, those entries

36
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to the places that are referred to on the blogs.

37
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It's wonderful.

38
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff.

39
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So, we see the imagery, of course,

40
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
not stopping at the sky.

41
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
These little green bubbles represent

42
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
photosynths that users have made.

43
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I'm not going to dive into them either, but photosynths are integrated into the map.

44
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Everything that's cased in blue

45
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well.

46
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And so, when you fly down --

47
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Applause)

48
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Thank you. When you fly down to the ground,

49
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and you see this kind of panoramic imagery,

50
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture,

51
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
there's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment

52
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
as there is of the three-dimensional city from above,

53
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
so if I click on something to get a closer view of it,

54
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
then, the fact that that transition looks as it does,

55
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is a function of all of that geometry,

56
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
all of that 3D understanding behind this model.

57
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Now, I'll show you a fun app

58
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that -- we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr.

59
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
This takes Flickr, georegistered imagery

60
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and uses photosynth-like processes

61
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to connect that imagery to our imagery, so --

62
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up, but --

63
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
But notice -- this is, of course, a popular tourist site,

65
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and there are lots of photos around here,

66
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and these photos are all taken at different times.

67
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So this one was taken around five.

68
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So that's the Flickr photo,

69
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that's our imagery.

70
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery

71
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
is integrating, in a very deep way, into the map itself.

72
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Applause)

73
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Thank you.

74
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Applause)

75
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
There are several reasons why this is interesting

76
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and one of them, of course, is time travel.

77
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here,

78
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well.

79
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But what's cool about this is that, not only is it augmenting

80
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
this visual representation of the world

81
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
with things that are coming in from users,

82
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
but it also is the foundation for augmented reality,

83
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment.

84
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting.

85
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
OK, notice there's now a roof above us.

86
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We're inside the Pike Place Market.

87
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera,

88
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
so, we're now not only imaging in the street

89
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
with this camera on tops of cars,

90
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
but we're also imaging inside.

91
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And from here, we're able to do the same sorts of registration,

92
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
not only of still images, but also of video.

93
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So this is something that we're now going to try

94
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
for the first time, live,

95
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and this is really, truly, very frightening.

96
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
OK.

98
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Ringing)

99
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
All right, guys, are you there?

100
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Noise)

101
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play.

102
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I'm live. All right. There we go.

103
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab.

104
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Applause)

105
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So they're broadcasting this live.

106
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
OK, George, can you pan back over to the corner market?

107
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Because I want to show points of interest.

108
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
No, no. The other way.

109
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Yeah, yeah, back to the corner, back to the corner.

110
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I don't want to see you guys yet.

111
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
OK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner.

112
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
OK, never mind.

113
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
What I wanted to show you was these points of interest

114
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
over here on top of the image

115
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
because what that gives you a sense of is the way,

116
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
if you're actually on the spot,

117
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
you can think about this --

118
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality.

119
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
What the hell are you guys -- oh, sorry.

120
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Laughter)

121
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
We're doing two different --

122
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
OK, I'm hanging up now.

123
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We're doing two different things here.

124
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
One of them is to take that real ...

125
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Laughter)

126
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
All right, let me just take a moment and thank the team.

127
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together.

128
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Applause)

129
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside.

130
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And while I walk outside, I'll just mention that

131
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
here we're using this for telepresence,

132
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
but you can equally well use this

133
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
on the spot, for augmented reality.

134
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
When you use it on the spot, it means that

135
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
you're able to bring all of that metadata

136
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and information about the world to you.

137
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it.

138
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
That was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network

139
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
from the market.

140
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
All right, and now there's one last TED talk

141
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that Microsoft has given in the past several years.

142
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And that's Curtis Wong, WorldWide Telescope.

143
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So, we're going to head over to the dumpsters,

144
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
where it's traditional, after a long day at the market,

145
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to go out for a break, but also stare up at the sky.

146
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
This is the integration

147
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
of WorldWide Telescope into our maps.

148
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
(Applause)

149
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
This is the current -- thank you --

150
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
this is the current time. If we scrub the time,

151
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
then we can see how the sky will look at different times,

152
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and we can get all of this very detailed

153
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
information about different times, different dates:

154
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky,

155
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
maybe change the date.

156
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon.

157
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So, this is an astronomically complete

158
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
representation of the sky

159
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000

1
0:00:26.61,000 --> 0:00:27,000
When you have 21 minutes to speak,

2
0:00:28.595,000 --> 0:00:3,000
two million years seems like a really long time.

3
0:00:31.548,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But evolutionarily, two million years is nothing.

4
0:00:34.065,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And yet, in two million years,

5
0:00:36.042,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the human brain has nearly tripled in mass,

6
0:00:39.821,000 --> 0:00:43,000
going from the one-and-a-quarter-pound brain of our ancestor here, Habilis,

7
0:00:44.054,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to the almost three-pound meatloaf everybody here has between their ears.

8
0:00:49.512,000 --> 0:00:52,000
What is it about a big brain

9
0:00:52.931,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that nature was so eager for every one of us to have one?

10
0:00:56.712,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Well, it turns out when brains triple in size,

11
0:00:58.971,000 --> 0:01:01,000
they don't just get three times bigger; they gain new structures.

12
0:01:02.51,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part,

13
0:01:07.42,000 --> 0:01:08,000
called the "frontal lobe,"

14
0:01:08.776,000 --> 0:01:1,000
particularly, a part called the "prefrontal cortex."

15
0:01:11.893,000 --> 0:01:13,000
What does a prefrontal cortex do for you

16
0:01:14.363,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that should justify the entire architectural overhaul of the human skull

17
0:01:18.964,000 --> 0:01:19,000
in the blink of evolutionary time?

18
0:01:20.751,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Well, it turns out the prefrontal cortex does lots of things,

19
0:01:23.791,000 --> 0:01:28,000
but one of the most important things it does is it's an experience simulator.

20
0:01:29.705,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Pilots practice in flight simulators

21
0:01:32.057,000 --> 0:01:34,000
so that they don't make real mistakes in planes.

22
0:01:34.997,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Human beings have this marvelous adaptation

23
0:01:37.617,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that they can actually have experiences in their heads

24
0:01:41.386,000 --> 0:01:43,000
before they try them out in real life.

25
0:01:43.601,000 --> 0:01:45,000
This is a trick that none of our ancestors could do,

26
0:01:46.148,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and that no other animal can do quite like we can.

27
0:01:49.413,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It's a marvelous adaptation.

28
0:01:50.967,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It's up there with opposable thumbs and standing upright and language

29
0:01:54.858,000 --> 0:01:57,000
as one of the things that got our species out of the trees

30
0:01:58.302,000 --> 0:02:,000
and into the shopping mall.

31
0:02:00.479,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

32
0:02:02.415,000 --> 0:02:03,000
All of you have done this.

33
0:02:04.312,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Ben and Jerry's doesn't have "liver and onion" ice cream,

34
0:02:07.576,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and it's not because they whipped some up, tried it and went, "Yuck!"

35
0:02:11.008,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's because, without leaving your armchair,

36
0:02:14.054,000 --> 0:02:18,000
you can simulate that flavor and say "yuck" before you make it.

37
0:02:20.652,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Let's see how your experience simulators are working.

38
0:02:23.248,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Let's just run a quick diagnostic

39
0:02:25.111,000 --> 0:02:27,000
before I proceed with the rest of the talk.

40
0:02:27.273,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Here's two different futures that I invite you to contemplate.

41
0:02:31.012,000 --> 0:02:35,000
You can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer.

42
0:02:35.062,000 --> 0:02:4,000
One of them is winning the lottery. This is about 314 million dollars.

43
0:02:40.62,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And the other is becoming paraplegic.

44
0:02:43.524,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:44.566,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Just give it a moment of thought.

46
0:02:46.218,000 --> 0:02:48,000
You probably don't feel like you need a moment of thought.

47
0:02:49.053,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Interestingly, there are data on these two groups of people,

48
0:02:53.195,000 --> 0:02:54,000
data on how happy they are.

49
0:02:55.197,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And this is exactly what you expected, isn't it?

50
0:02:58.24,000 --> 0:03:,000
But these aren't the data. I made these up!

51
0:03:01.038,000 --> 0:03:02,000
These are the data.

52
0:03:02.714,000 --> 0:03:05,000
You failed the pop quiz, and you're hardly five minutes into the lecture.

53
0:03:06.234,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs

54
0:03:10.43,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and a year after winning the lotto,

55
0:03:12.831,000 --> 0:03:17,000
lottery winners and paraplegics are equally happy with their lives.

56
0:03:18.356,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Don't feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz,

57
0:03:20.836,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time.

58
0:03:24.795,000 --> 0:03:26,000
The research that my laboratory has been doing,

59
0:03:27.208,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that economists and psychologists around the country have been doing,

60
0:03:30.565,000 --> 0:03:32,000
has revealed something really quite startling to us,

61
0:03:33.385,000 --> 0:03:34,000
something we call the "impact bias,"

62
0:03:35.254,000 --> 0:03:38,000
which is the tendency for the simulator to work badly,

63
0:03:38.795,000 --> 0:03:43,000
for the simulator to make you believe that different outcomes are more different

64
0:03:43.958,000 --> 0:03:44,000
than, in fact, they really are.

65
0:03:45.506,000 --> 0:03:47,000
From field studies to laboratory studies,

66
0:03:47.708,000 --> 0:03:49,000
we see that winning or losing an election,

67
0:03:50.091,000 --> 0:03:52,000
gaining or losing a romantic partner,

68
0:03:52.379,000 --> 0:03:53,000
getting or not getting a promotion,

69
0:03:54.133,000 --> 0:03:56,000
passing or not passing a college test,

70
0:03:56.322,000 --> 0:03:57,000
on and on,

71
0:03:57.905,000 --> 0:04:01,000
have far less impact, less intensity and much less duration

72
0:04:02.244,000 --> 0:04:04,000
than people expect them to have.

73
0:04:05.974,000 --> 0:04:1,000
A recent study -- this almost floors me --

74
0:04:11.085,000 --> 0:04:15,000
a recent study showing how major life traumas affect people

75
0:04:15.65,000 --> 0:04:17,000
suggests that if it happened over three months ago,

76
0:04:18.653,000 --> 0:04:19,000
with only a few exceptions,

77
0:04:20.228,000 --> 0:04:22,000
it has no impact whatsoever on your happiness.

78
0:04:24.861,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Why?

79
0:04:26.589,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Because happiness can be synthesized.

80
0:04:30.214,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Sir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642, "I am the happiest man alive.

81
0:04:34.455,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I have that in me that can convert poverty to riches, adversity to prosperity.

82
0:04:39.595,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I am more invulnerable than Achilles; fortune hath not one place to hit me."

83
0:04:44.565,000 --> 0:04:47,000
What kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head?

84
0:04:47.778,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Well, it turns out it's precisely the same remarkable machinery that all of us have.

85
0:04:53.819,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Human beings have something

86
0:04:55.522,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that we might think of as a "psychological immune system,"

87
0:04:58.928,000 --> 0:05:02,000
a system of cognitive processes, largely nonconscious cognitive processes,

88
0:05:03.544,000 --> 0:05:06,000
that help them change their views of the world,

89
0:05:07.177,000 --> 0:05:09,000
so that they can feel better about the worlds

90
0:05:09.636,000 --> 0:05:11,000
in which they find themselves.

91
0:05:11.866,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Like Sir Thomas, you have this machine.

92
0:05:14.199,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Unlike Sir Thomas, you seem not to know it.

93
0:05:18.486,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We synthesize happiness, but we think happiness is a thing to be found.

94
0:05:23.595,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Now, you don't need me to give you

95
0:05:25.293,000 --> 0:05:29,000
too many examples of people synthesizing happiness, I suspect,

96
0:05:29.453,000 --> 0:05:31,000
though I'm going to show you some experimental evidence.

97
0:05:32.134,000 --> 0:05:34,000
You don't have to look very far for evidence.

98
0:05:34.294,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I took a copy of the "New York Times"

99
0:05:36.105,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness.

100
0:05:39.258,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Here are three guys synthesizing happiness.

101
0:05:41.3,000 --> 0:05:43,000
"I'm better off physically, financially, mentally ..."

102
0:05:43.866,000 --> 0:05:46,000
"I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience."

103
0:05:46.962,000 --> 0:05:47,000
"I believe it turned out for the best."

104
0:05:48.894,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Who are these characters who are so damn happy?

105
0:05:51.133,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The first one is Jim Wright.

106
0:05:52.504,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Some of you are old enough to remember:

107
0:05:54.4,000 --> 0:05:56,000
he was the chairman of the House of Representatives,

108
0:05:56.888,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and he resigned in disgrace

109
0:05:58.22,000 --> 0:06:,000
when this young Republican named Newt Gingrich found out about

110
0:06:01.172,000 --> 0:06:02,000
a shady book deal that he had done.

111
0:06:02.864,000 --> 0:06:03,000
He lost everything.

112
0:06:04.047,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The most powerful Democrat in the country lost everything:

113
0:06:06.808,000 --> 0:06:07,000
he lost his money, he lost his power.

114
0:06:08.604,000 --> 0:06:1,000
What does he have to say all these years later about it?

115
0:06:11.276,000 --> 0:06:13,000
"I am so much better off physically, financially, mentally

116
0:06:14.04,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and in almost every other way."

117
0:06:15.547,000 --> 0:06:17,000
What other way would there be to be better off?

118
0:06:17.777,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Vegetably? Minerally? Animally?

119
0:06:20.162,000 --> 0:06:21,000
He's pretty much covered them there.

120
0:06:22.021,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Moreese Bickham is somebody you've never heard of.

121
0:06:24.461,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Moreese Bickham uttered these words upon being released.

122
0:06:27.536,000 --> 0:06:28,000
He was 78 years old.

123
0:06:28.751,000 --> 0:06:3,000
He'd spent 37 years in Louisiana State Penitentiary

124
0:06:31.516,000 --> 0:06:32,000
for a crime he didn't commit.

125
0:06:33.093,000 --> 0:06:37,000
He was ultimately [released for good behavior halfway through his sentence.]

126
0:06:37.249,000 --> 0:06:39,000
What did he have to say about his experience?

127
0:06:39.377,000 --> 0:06:42,000
"I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience."

128
0:06:42.488,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Glorious!

129
0:06:43.676,000 --> 0:06:46,000
This guy's not saying, "There were some nice guys. They had a gym."

130
0:06:46.87,000 --> 0:06:5,000
"Glorious" -- a word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience.

131
0:06:50.917,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Harry S. Langerman uttered these words.

132
0:06:53.153,000 --> 0:06:55,000
He's somebody you might have known but didn't,

133
0:06:55.556,000 --> 0:06:57,000
because in 1949, he read a little article in the paper

134
0:06:58.412,000 --> 0:07:01,000
about a hamburger stand owned by these two brothers named McDonald.

135
0:07:01.729,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And he thought, "That's a really neat idea!"

136
0:07:03.858,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So he went to find them.

137
0:07:05.066,000 --> 0:07:08,000
They said, "We can give you a franchise on this for 3,000 bucks."

138
0:07:08.183,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Harry went back to New York, asked his brother, an investment banker,

139
0:07:11.472,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to loan him 3,000 dollars, and his brother's immortal words were,

140
0:07:14.578,000 --> 0:07:15,000
"You idiot, nobody eats hamburgers."

141
0:07:16.32,000 --> 0:07:17,000
He wouldn't lend him the money.

142
0:07:17.834,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Of course, six months later, Ray Kroc had exactly the same idea.

143
0:07:20.929,000 --> 0:07:22,000
It turns out, people do eat hamburgers,

144
0:07:22.992,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and Ray Kroc, for a while, became the richest man in America.

145
0:07:26.864,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And then, finally,

146
0:07:28.046,000 --> 0:07:31,000
some of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best,

147
0:07:31.53,000 --> 0:07:33,000
who was the original drummer for the Beatles,

148
0:07:33.963,000 --> 0:07:36,000
until they, you know, sent him out on an errand and snuck away

149
0:07:37.546,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and picked up Ringo on a tour.

150
0:07:39.53,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Well, in 1994, when Pete Best was interviewed --

151
0:07:41.85,000 --> 0:07:44,000
yes, he's still a drummer; yes, he's a studio musician --

152
0:07:44.91,000 --> 0:07:47,000
he had this to say: "I'm happier than I would have been with the Beatles."

153
0:07:48.441,000 --> 0:07:51,000
OK, there's something important to be learned from these people,

154
0:07:51.597,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and it is the secret of happiness.

155
0:07:53.496,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Here it is, finally to be revealed.

156
0:07:55.893,000 --> 0:07:57,000
First: accrue wealth, power and prestige,

157
0:07:58.611,000 --> 0:07:59,000
then lose it.

158
0:07:59.807,000 --> 0:08:,000
(Laughter)

159
0:08:01.815,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Second: spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can.

160
0:08:05.785,000 --> 0:08:06,000
(Laughter)

161
0:08:06.811,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Third: make somebody else really, really rich.

162
0:08:10.016,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And finally: never, ever join the Beatles.

163
0:08:12.623,000 --> 0:08:13,000
(Laughter)

164
0:08:13.671,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Yeah, right.

165
0:08:14.846,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Because when people synthesize happiness,

166
0:08:16.956,000 --> 0:08:18,000
as these gentlemen seem to have done,

167
0:08:19.174,000 --> 0:08:22,000
we all smile at them, but we kind of roll our eyes and say,

168
0:08:22.977,000 --> 0:08:24,000
"Yeah, right, you never really wanted the job."

169
0:08:25.422,000 --> 0:08:29,000
"Oh yeah, right -- you really didn't have that much in common with her,

170
0:08:29.537,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and you figured that out just about the time

171
0:08:31.657,000 --> 0:08:33,000
she threw the engagement ring in your face."

172
0:08:33.777,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We smirk,

173
0:08:34.952,000 --> 0:08:37,000
because we believe that synthetic happiness is not of the same quality

174
0:08:38.886,000 --> 0:08:4,000
as what we might call "natural happiness."

175
0:08:41.109,000 --> 0:08:42,000
What are these terms?

176
0:08:42.513,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Natural happiness is what we get when we get what we wanted,

177
0:08:45.941,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and synthetic happiness is what we make when we don't get what we wanted.

178
0:08:50.869,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And in our society, we have a strong belief

179
0:08:53.938,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind.

180
0:08:57.003,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Why do we have that belief?

181
0:08:58.9,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Well, it's very simple.

182
0:09:00.598,000 --> 0:09:03,000
What kind of economic engine would keep churning

183
0:09:04.615,000 --> 0:09:06,000
if we believed that not getting what we want

184
0:09:07.375,000 --> 0:09:09,000
could make us just as happy as getting it?

185
0:09:10.844,000 --> 0:09:13,000
With all apologies to my friend Matthieu Ricard,

186
0:09:14.085,000 --> 0:09:16,000
a shopping mall full of Zen monks

187
0:09:16.197,000 --> 0:09:18,000
is not going to be particularly profitable,

188
0:09:18.423,000 --> 0:09:2,000
because they don't want stuff enough.

189
0:09:20.961,000 --> 0:09:21,000
(Laughter)

190
0:09:22.066,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I want to suggest to you

191
0:09:23.921,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and enduring

192
0:09:27.938,000 --> 0:09:29,000
as the kind of happiness you stumble upon

193
0:09:30.091,000 --> 0:09:32,000
when you get exactly what you were aiming for.

194
0:09:32.857,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Now, I'm a scientist, so I'm going to do this not with rhetoric,

195
0:09:35.902,000 --> 0:09:37,000
but by marinating you in a little bit of data.

196
0:09:38.088,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Let me first show you an experimental paradigm

197
0:09:40.336,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that's used to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness

198
0:09:44.049,000 --> 0:09:45,000
among regular old folks.

199
0:09:45.23,000 --> 0:09:46,000
This isn't mine,

200
0:09:46.42,000 --> 0:09:48,000
it's a 50-year-old paradigm called the "free choice paradigm."

201
0:09:49.381,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It's very simple.

202
0:09:50.575,000 --> 0:09:52,000
You bring in, say, six objects,

203
0:09:53.146,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked.

204
0:09:56.431,000 --> 0:09:58,000
In this case, because this experiment uses them,

205
0:09:59.013,000 --> 0:10:,000
these are Monet prints.

206
0:10:00.888,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Everybody ranks these Monet prints from the one they like the most

207
0:10:04.071,000 --> 0:10:05,000
to the one they like the least.

208
0:10:05.587,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Now we give you a choice:

209
0:10:07.336,000 --> 0:10:09,000
"We happen to have some extra prints in the closet.

210
0:10:09.775,000 --> 0:10:11,000
We're going to give you one as your prize to take home.

211
0:10:12.417,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We happen to have number three and number four," we tell the subject.

212
0:10:16.522,000 --> 0:10:17,000
This is a bit of a difficult choice,

213
0:10:18.27,000 --> 0:10:2,000
because neither one is preferred strongly to the other,

214
0:10:20.889,000 --> 0:10:22,000
but naturally, people tend to pick number three,

215
0:10:23.542,000 --> 0:10:25,000
because they liked it a little better than number four.

216
0:10:26.764,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Sometime later -- it could be 15 minutes, it could be 15 days --

217
0:10:30.399,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the same stimuli are put before the subject,

218
0:10:32.494,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and the subject is asked to re-rank the stimuli.

219
0:10:35.057,000 --> 0:10:37,000
"Tell us how much you like them now."

220
0:10:37.231,000 --> 0:10:38,000
What happens?

221
0:10:38.461,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Watch as happiness is synthesized.

222
0:10:40.37,000 --> 0:10:43,000
This is the result that's been replicated over and over again.

223
0:10:43.589,000 --> 0:10:44,000
You're watching happiness be synthesized.

224
0:10:45.604,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Would you like to see it again?

225
0:10:48.023,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Happiness!

226
0:10:49.2,000 --> 0:10:51,000
"The one I got is really better than I thought!

227
0:10:51.626,000 --> 0:10:53,000
That other one I didn't get sucks!"

228
0:10:54.189,000 --> 0:10:55,000
That's the synthesis of happiness.

229
0:10:55.974,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Laughter)

230
0:10:57.648,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Now, what's the right response to that?

231
0:10:59.81,000 --> 0:11:,000
"Yeah, right!"

232
0:11:02.334,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Now, here's the experiment we did,

233
0:11:04.506,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and I hope this is going to convince you

234
0:11:06.492,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that "Yeah, right!" was not the right response.

235
0:11:08.746,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We did this experiment with a group of patients

236
0:11:10.962,000 --> 0:11:11,000
who had anterograde amnesia.

237
0:11:12.323,000 --> 0:11:13,000
These are hospitalized patients.

238
0:11:14.006,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Most of them have Korsakoff syndrome,

239
0:11:16.195,000 --> 0:11:18,000
a polyneuritic psychosis.

240
0:11:18.955,000 --> 0:11:21,000
They drank way too much, and they can't make new memories.

241
0:11:22.88,000 --> 0:11:25,000
They remember their childhood, but if you walk in and introduce yourself

242
0:11:26.353,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and then leave the room,

243
0:11:27.57,000 --> 0:11:29,000
when you come back, they don't know who you are.

244
0:11:31.019,000 --> 0:11:33,000
We took our Monet prints to the hospital.

245
0:11:34.391,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And we asked these patients to rank them

246
0:11:37.795,000 --> 0:11:4,000
from the one they liked the most to the one they liked the least.

247
0:11:41.093,000 --> 0:11:44,000
We then gave them the choice between number three and number four.

248
0:11:44.969,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Like everybody else, they said,

249
0:11:46.515,000 --> 0:11:48,000
"Gee, thanks Doc! That's great! I could use a new print.

250
0:11:49.23,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I'll take number three."

251
0:11:50.86,000 --> 0:11:53,000
We explained we would have number three mailed to them.

252
0:11:54.416,000 --> 0:11:55,000
We gathered up our materials,

253
0:11:56.346,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and we went out of the room and counted to a half hour.

254
0:11:58.991,000 --> 0:11:59,000
(Laughter)

255
0:12:00.017,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Back into the room, we say, "Hi, we're back."

256
0:12:03.336,000 --> 0:12:06,000
The patients, bless them, say, "Ah, Doc, I'm sorry,

257
0:12:07.012,000 --> 0:12:09,000
I've got a memory problem; that's why I'm here.

258
0:12:09.266,000 --> 0:12:11,000
If I've met you before, I don't remember."

259
0:12:11.321,000 --> 0:12:14,000
"Really, Jim, you don't remember? I was just here with the Monet prints?"

260
0:12:14.82,000 --> 0:12:16,000
"Sorry, Doc, I just don't have a clue."

261
0:12:17.036,000 --> 0:12:18,000
"No problem, Jim.

262
0:12:18.644,000 --> 0:12:2,000
All I want you to do is rank these for me,

263
0:12:20.917,000 --> 0:12:23,000
from the one you like the most to the one you like the least."

264
0:12:24.966,000 --> 0:12:25,000
What do they do?

265
0:12:26.141,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Well, let's first check and make sure they're really amnesiac.

266
0:12:29.105,000 --> 0:12:32,000
We ask these amnesiac patients to tell us which one they own,

267
0:12:32.917,000 --> 0:12:35,000
which one they chose last time, which one is theirs.

268
0:12:36.339,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And what we find is, amnesiac patients just guess.

269
0:12:39.569,000 --> 0:12:41,000
These are normal controls, where if I did this with you,

270
0:12:42.269,000 --> 0:12:44,000
all of you would know which print you chose.

271
0:12:44.402,000 --> 0:12:47,000
But if I do this with amnesiac patients, they don't have a clue.

272
0:12:48.031,000 --> 0:12:5,000
They can't pick their print out of a lineup.

273
0:12:51.825,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Here's what normal controls do: they synthesize happiness. Right?

274
0:12:56.304,000 --> 0:12:57,000
This is the change in liking score,

275
0:12:58.135,000 --> 0:13:01,000
the change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked.

276
0:13:01.672,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Normal controls show -- that was the magic I showed you;

277
0:13:04.376,000 --> 0:13:06,000
now I'm showing it to you in graphical form --

278
0:13:06.644,000 --> 0:13:07,000
"The one I own is better than I thought.

279
0:13:08.577,000 --> 0:13:1,000
The one I didn't own, the one I left behind,

280
0:13:11.093,000 --> 0:13:12,000
is not as good as I thought."

281
0:13:13.52,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing. Think about this result.

282
0:13:18.027,000 --> 0:13:2,000
These people like better the one they own,

283
0:13:20.972,000 --> 0:13:22,000
but they don't know they own it.

284
0:13:24.526,000 --> 0:13:27,000
"Yeah, right" is not the right response!

285
0:13:28.885,000 --> 0:13:31,000
What these people did when they synthesized happiness

286
0:13:32.164,000 --> 0:13:34,000
is they really, truly changed

287
0:13:34.75,000 --> 0:13:38,000
their affective, hedonic, aesthetic reactions to that poster.

288
0:13:40.003,000 --> 0:13:42,000
They're not just saying it because they own it,

289
0:13:42.416,000 --> 0:13:44,000
because they don't know they own it.

290
0:13:45.753,000 --> 0:13:47,000
When psychologists show you bars,

291
0:13:48.339,000 --> 0:13:51,000
you know that they are showing you averages of lots of people.

292
0:13:51.918,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And yet, all of us have this psychological immune system,

293
0:13:55.251,000 --> 0:13:57,000
this capacity to synthesize happiness,

294
0:13:57.749,000 --> 0:14:,000
but some of us do this trick better than others.

295
0:14:00.924,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively

296
0:14:04.981,000 --> 0:14:05,000
than other situations do.

297
0:14:08.321,000 --> 0:14:11,000
It turns out that freedom,

298
0:14:11.59,000 --> 0:14:14,000
the ability to make up your mind and change your mind,

299
0:14:14.94,000 --> 0:14:16,000
is the friend of natural happiness,

300
0:14:17.117,000 --> 0:14:2,000
because it allows you to choose among all those delicious futures

301
0:14:20.852,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and find the one that you would most enjoy.

302
0:14:23.226,000 --> 0:14:24,000
But freedom to choose,

303
0:14:25.002,000 --> 0:14:26,000
to change and make up your mind,

304
0:14:26.783,000 --> 0:14:28,000
is the enemy of synthetic happiness,

305
0:14:29.604,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and I'm going to show you why.

306
0:14:31.075,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Dilbert already knows, of course.

307
0:14:32.799,000 --> 0:14:34,000
"Dogbert's tech support. How may I abuse you?"

308
0:14:35.005,000 --> 0:14:37,000
"My printer prints a blank page after every document."

309
0:14:37.643,000 --> 0:14:38,000
"Why complain about getting free paper?"

310
0:14:39.643,000 --> 0:14:41,000
"Free? Aren't you just giving me my own paper?"

311
0:14:41.943,000 --> 0:14:44,000
"Look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper!

312
0:14:45.643,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Only a fool or a liar would say that they look the same!"

313
0:14:48.443,000 --> 0:14:5,000
"Now that you mention it, it does seem a little silkier!"

314
0:14:51.229,000 --> 0:14:52,000
"What are you doing?"

315
0:14:52.429,000 --> 0:14:55,000
"I'm helping people accept the things they cannot change." Indeed.

316
0:14:56.835,000 --> 0:14:58,000
The psychological immune system works best

317
0:14:59.303,000 --> 0:15:02,000
when we are totally stuck, when we are trapped.

318
0:15:02.344,000 --> 0:15:04,000
This is the difference between dating and marriage.

319
0:15:04.887,000 --> 0:15:05,000
You go out on a date with a guy,

320
0:15:06.466,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and he picks his nose; you don't go out on another date.

321
0:15:09.134,000 --> 0:15:11,000
You're married to a guy and he picks his nose?

322
0:15:11.322,000 --> 0:15:13,000
He has a heart of gold. Don't touch the fruitcake!

323
0:15:13.999,000 --> 0:15:16,000
You find a way to be happy with what's happened.

324
0:15:17.444,000 --> 0:15:18,000
(Laughter)

325
0:15:18.469,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Now, what I want to show you

326
0:15:19.882,000 --> 0:15:21,000
is that people don't know this about themselves,

327
0:15:22.509,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and not knowing this can work to our supreme disadvantage.

328
0:15:26.811,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Here's an experiment we did at Harvard.

329
0:15:28.812,000 --> 0:15:31,000
We created a black-and-white photography course,

330
0:15:31.864,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a darkroom.

331
0:15:35.465,000 --> 0:15:37,000
So we gave them cameras, they went around campus,

332
0:15:37.832,000 --> 0:15:39,000
they took 12 pictures of their favorite professors

333
0:15:40.217,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and their dorm room and their dog,

334
0:15:42.296,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and all the other things they wanted to have Harvard memories of.

335
0:15:45.438,000 --> 0:15:47,000
They bring us the camera, we make up a contact sheet,

336
0:15:47.988,000 --> 0:15:49,000
they figure out which are the two best pictures.

337
0:15:50.307,000 --> 0:15:52,000
We now spend six hours teaching them about darkrooms,

338
0:15:52.842,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and they blow two of them up.

339
0:15:54.29,000 --> 0:15:55,000
They have two gorgeous 8 x 10 glossies

340
0:15:56.18,000 --> 0:15:58,000
of meaningful things to them, and we say,

341
0:15:58.225,000 --> 0:16:,000
"Which one would you like to give up?"

342
0:16:00.62,000 --> 0:16:01,000
"I have to give one up?"

343
0:16:01.795,000 --> 0:16:04,000
"Yes, we need one as evidence of the class project.

344
0:16:04.931,000 --> 0:16:06,000
So you have to give me one. You have to make a choice.

345
0:16:07.573,000 --> 0:16:09,000
You get to keep one, and I get to keep one."

346
0:16:10.343,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Now, there are two conditions in this experiment.

347
0:16:13.343,000 --> 0:16:15,000
In one case, the students are told,

348
0:16:15.645,000 --> 0:16:17,000
"But you know, if you want to change your mind,

349
0:16:18.025,000 --> 0:16:19,000
I'll always have the other one here,

350
0:16:19.902,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and in the next four days, before I actually mail it to headquarters" --

351
0:16:24.401,000 --> 0:16:25,000
yeah, "headquarters" --

352
0:16:26.358,000 --> 0:16:27,000
(Laughter)

353
0:16:27.387,000 --> 0:16:28,000
"I'll be glad to swap it out with you.

354
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
In fact, I'll come to your dorm room, just give me an email.

355
0:16:32.337,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Better yet, I'll check with you.

356
0:16:34.352,000 --> 0:16:36,000
You ever want to change your mind, it's totally returnable."

357
0:16:37.264,000 --> 0:16:39,000
The other half of the students are told exactly the opposite:

358
0:16:40.185,000 --> 0:16:41,000
"Make your choice, and by the way,

359
0:16:41.939,000 --> 0:16:43,000
the mail is going out, gosh, in two minutes, to England.

360
0:16:44.853,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Your picture will be winging its way over the Atlantic.

361
0:16:47.522,000 --> 0:16:48,000
You will never see it again."

362
0:16:49.881,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Half of the students in each of these conditions

363
0:16:52.162,000 --> 0:16:53,000
are asked to make predictions

364
0:16:53.666,000 --> 0:16:55,000
about how much they're going to come to like

365
0:16:55.762,000 --> 0:16:56,000
the picture that they keep

366
0:16:57.138,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and the picture they leave behind.

367
0:16:58.849,000 --> 0:17:,000
Other students are just sent back to their little dorm rooms

368
0:17:01.774,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and they are measured over the next three to six days

369
0:17:04.909,000 --> 0:17:05,000
on their satisfaction with the pictures.

370
0:17:06.931,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Look at what we find.

371
0:17:08.193,000 --> 0:17:11,000
First of all, here's what students think is going to happen.

372
0:17:11.572,000 --> 0:17:14,000
They think they're going to maybe come to like the picture they chose

373
0:17:15.489,000 --> 0:17:17,000
a little more than the one they left behind.

374
0:17:18.029,000 --> 0:17:21,000
But these are not statistically significant differences.

375
0:17:21.141,000 --> 0:17:24,000
It's a very small increase, and it doesn't much matter

376
0:17:24.681,000 --> 0:17:26,000
whether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition.

377
0:17:27.673,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Wrong-o.

378
0:17:28.857,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Bad simulators.

379
0:17:30.05,000 --> 0:17:31,000
Because here's what's really happening.

380
0:17:31.972,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Both right before the swap and five days later,

381
0:17:35.33,000 --> 0:17:37,000
people who are stuck with that picture,

382
0:17:37.54,000 --> 0:17:38,000
who have no choice,

383
0:17:38.716,000 --> 0:17:4,000
who can never change their mind,

384
0:17:40.78,000 --> 0:17:41,000
like it a lot.

385
0:17:42.934,000 --> 0:17:44,000
And people who are deliberating -- "Should I return it?

386
0:17:45.909,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Have I gotten the right one?

387
0:17:47.316,000 --> 0:17:49,000
Maybe this isn't the good one. Maybe I left the good one?" --

388
0:17:50.239,000 --> 0:17:51,000
have killed themselves.

389
0:17:51.463,000 --> 0:17:52,000
They don't like their picture.

390
0:17:52.945,000 --> 0:17:54,000
In fact, even after the opportunity to swap has expired,

391
0:17:55.626,000 --> 0:17:57,000
they still don't like their picture.

392
0:17:58.127,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Why?

393
0:17:59.302,000 --> 0:18:02,000
Because the [reversible] condition is not conducive

394
0:18:02.634,000 --> 0:18:03,000
to the synthesis of happiness.

395
0:18:05.218,000 --> 0:18:07,000
So here's the final piece of this experiment.

396
0:18:08.145,000 --> 0:18:11,000
We bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard students

397
0:18:11.909,000 --> 0:18:14,000
and we say, "You know, we're doing a photography course,

398
0:18:15.289,000 --> 0:18:16,000
and we can do it one of two ways.

399
0:18:17.607,000 --> 0:18:19,000
We could do it so that when you take the two pictures,

400
0:18:20.264,000 --> 0:18:22,000
you'd have four days to change your mind,

401
0:18:22.309,000 --> 0:18:24,000
or we're doing another course where you take the two pictures

402
0:18:25.222,000 --> 0:18:28,000
and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it.

403
0:18:28.311,000 --> 0:18:3,000
Which course would you like to be in?" Duh!

404
0:18:30.359,000 --> 0:18:32,000
Sixty-six percent of the students, two-thirds,

405
0:18:32.801,000 --> 0:18:36,000
prefer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind.

406
0:18:36.894,000 --> 0:18:39,000
Hello? Sixty-six percent of the students choose to be in the course

407
0:18:40.48,000 --> 0:18:43,000
in which they will ultimately be deeply dissatisfied with the picture --

408
0:18:44.168,000 --> 0:18:45,000
(Laughter)

409
0:18:45.208,000 --> 0:18:5,000
because they do not know the conditions under which synthetic happiness grows.

410
0:18:51.747,000 --> 0:18:56,000
The Bard said everything best, of course, and he's making my point here

411
0:18:56.775,000 --> 0:18:57,000
but he's making it hyperbolically:

412
0:18:58.775,000 --> 0:19:01,000
"'Tis nothing good or bad But thinking makes it so."

413
0:19:02.059,000 --> 0:19:05,000
It's nice poetry, but that can't exactly be right.

414
0:19:05.305,000 --> 0:19:07,000
Is there really nothing good or bad?

415
0:19:07.417,000 --> 0:19:1,000
Is it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to Paris

416
0:19:11.356,000 --> 0:19:12,000
are just the same thing?

417
0:19:12.917,000 --> 0:19:13,000
(Laughter)

418
0:19:14.028,000 --> 0:19:17,000
That seems like a one-question IQ test.

419
0:19:17.909,000 --> 0:19:18,000
They can't be exactly the same.

420
0:19:19.805,000 --> 0:19:22,000
In more turgid prose, but closer to the truth,

421
0:19:22.909,000 --> 0:19:25,000
was the father of modern capitalism, Adam Smith, and he said this.

422
0:19:26.307,000 --> 0:19:27,000
This is worth contemplating:

423
0:19:28.286,000 --> 0:19:31,000
"The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life

424
0:19:32.262,000 --> 0:19:34,000
seems to arise from overrating the difference

425
0:19:34.909,000 --> 0:19:36,000
between one permanent situation and another.

426
0:19:37.909,000 --> 0:19:42,000
Some of these situations may, no doubt, deserve to be preferred to others,

427
0:19:43.23,000 --> 0:19:45,000
but none of them can deserve to be pursued

428
0:19:46.183,000 --> 0:19:5,000
with that passionate ardor which drives us to violate the rules

429
0:19:50.777,000 --> 0:19:52,000
either of prudence or of justice,

430
0:19:53.27,000 --> 0:19:55,000
or to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds,

431
0:19:56.059,000 --> 0:19:59,000
either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly,

432
0:19:59.62,000 --> 0:20:03,000
or by remorse for the horror of our own injustice."

433
0:20:03.716,000 --> 0:20:07,000
In other words: yes, some things are better than others.

434
0:20:08.472,000 --> 0:20:13,000
We should have preferences that lead us into one future over another.

435
0:20:13.999,000 --> 0:20:16,000
But when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast

436
0:20:17.804,000 --> 0:20:2,000
because we have overrated the difference between these futures,

437
0:20:21.519,000 --> 0:20:23,000
we are at risk.

438
0:20:24.079,000 --> 0:20:27,000
When our ambition is bounded, it leads us to work joyfully.

439
0:20:27.821,000 --> 0:20:28,000
When our ambition is unbounded,

440
0:20:29.717,000 --> 0:20:33,000
it leads us to lie, to cheat, to steal, to hurt others,

441
0:20:34.155,000 --> 0:20:35,000
to sacrifice things of real value.

442
0:20:36.178,000 --> 0:20:38,000
When our fears are bounded,

443
0:20:38.219,000 --> 0:20:4,000
we're prudent, we're cautious,

444
0:20:40.378,000 --> 0:20:41,000
we're thoughtful.

445
0:20:41.585,000 --> 0:20:44,000
When our fears are unbounded and overblown,

446
0:20:44.872,000 --> 0:20:46,000
we're reckless, and we're cowardly.

447
0:20:47.625,000 --> 0:20:5,000
The lesson I want to leave you with, from these data,

448
0:20:50.999,000 --> 0:20:54,000
is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown,

449
0:20:55.102,000 --> 0:21:01,000
because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity

450
0:21:01.298,000 --> 0:21:05,000
we are constantly chasing when we choose experience.

451
0:21:05.741,000 --> 0:21:06,000
Thank you.

452
0:21:06.916,000 --> 0:21:1,000
(Applause)

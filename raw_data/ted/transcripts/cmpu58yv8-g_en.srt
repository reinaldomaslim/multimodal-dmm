1
0:00:12.96,000 --> 0:00:13,000
When Dorothy was a little girl,

2
0:00:14.56,000 --> 0:00:15,000
she was fascinated by her goldfish.

3
0:00:17.08,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Her father explained to her that fish swim by quickly wagging their tails

4
0:00:20.56,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to propel themselves through the water.

5
0:00:23.04,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Without hesitation, little Dorothy responded,

6
0:00:25.2,000 --> 0:00:28,000
"Yes, Daddy, and fish swim backwards by wagging their heads."

7
0:00:28.48,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:30.12,000 --> 0:00:32,000
In her mind, it was a fact as true as any other.

9
0:00:32.96,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Fish swim backwards by wagging their heads.

10
0:00:35.32,000 --> 0:00:36,000
She believed it.

11
0:00:37.32,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Our lives are full of fish swimming backwards.

12
0:00:40.32,000 --> 0:00:42,000
We make assumptions and faulty leaps of logic.

13
0:00:42.84,000 --> 0:00:43,000
We harbor bias.

14
0:00:44.119,000 --> 0:00:46,000
We know that we are right, and they are wrong.

15
0:00:46.4,000 --> 0:00:47,000
We fear the worst.

16
0:00:48.04,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We strive for unattainable perfection.

17
0:00:50.92,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We tell ourselves what we can and cannot do.

18
0:00:53.88,000 --> 0:00:57,000
In our minds, fish swim by in reverse frantically wagging their heads

19
0:00:58,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and we don't even notice them.

20
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I'm going to tell you five facts about myself.

21
0:01:03.36,000 --> 0:01:04,000
One fact is not true.

22
0:01:05.76,000 --> 0:01:09,000
One: I graduated from Harvard at 19 with an honors degree in mathematics.

23
0:01:11.68,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Two: I currently run a construction company in Orlando.

24
0:01:16.92,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Three: I starred on a television sitcom.

25
0:01:21.44,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Four: I lost my sight to a rare genetic eye disease.

26
0:01:26.96,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Five: I served as a law clerk to two US Supreme Court justices.

27
0:01:32.36,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Which fact is not true?

28
0:01:35.88,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Actually, they're all true.

29
0:01:38.24,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Yeah. They're all true.

30
0:01:40.8,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Applause)

31
0:01:44.68,000 --> 0:01:47,000
At this point, most people really only care about the television show.

32
0:01:48.36,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:51.68,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I know this from experience.

34
0:01:54.32,000 --> 0:01:57,000
OK, so the show was NBC's "Saved by the Bell: The New Class."

35
0:01:57.68,000 --> 0:02:,000
And I played Weasel Wyzell,

36
0:02:02.24,000 --> 0:02:06,000
who was the sort of dorky, nerdy character on the show,

37
0:02:06.32,000 --> 0:02:1,000
which made it a very major acting challenge

38
0:02:11.12,000 --> 0:02:12,000
for me as a 13-year-old boy.

39
0:02:12.64,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:15.32,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Now, did you struggle with number four, my blindness?

41
0:02:19.12,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Why is that?

42
0:02:21.28,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We make assumptions about so-called disabilities.

43
0:02:24.28,000 --> 0:02:27,000
As a blind man, I confront others' incorrect assumptions

44
0:02:27.48,000 --> 0:02:28,000
about my abilities every day.

45
0:02:30.64,000 --> 0:02:32,000
My point today is not about my blindness, however.

46
0:02:33.2,000 --> 0:02:34,000
It's about my vision.

47
0:02:35.48,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Going blind taught me to live my life eyes wide open.

48
0:02:40.2,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It taught me to spot those backwards-swimming fish

49
0:02:42.6,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that our minds create.

50
0:02:44.12,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Going blind cast them into focus.

51
0:02:47.76,000 --> 0:02:49,000
What does it feel like to see?

52
0:02:50.72,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It's immediate and passive.

53
0:02:52.8,000 --> 0:02:54,000
You open your eyes and there's the world.

54
0:02:54.96,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Seeing is believing. Sight is truth.

55
0:02:57.08,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Right?

56
0:02:59.12,000 --> 0:03:,000
Well, that's what I thought.

57
0:03:01.52,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Then, from age 12 to 25, my retinas progressively deteriorated.

58
0:03:07.28,000 --> 0:03:1,000
My sight became an increasingly bizarre

59
0:03:10.32,000 --> 0:03:12,000
carnival funhouse hall of mirrors and illusions.

60
0:03:13.64,000 --> 0:03:15,000
The salesperson I was relieved to spot in a store

61
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
was really a mannequin.

62
0:03:17.88,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Reaching down to wash my hands,

63
0:03:19.4,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I suddenly saw it was a urinal I was touching, not a sink,

64
0:03:22.64,000 --> 0:03:23,000
when my fingers felt its true shape.

65
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
A friend described the photograph in my hand,

66
0:03:27.32,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and only then I could see the image depicted.

67
0:03:30.72,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Objects appeared, morphed and disappeared in my reality.

68
0:03:36.08,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It was difficult and exhausting to see.

69
0:03:39.6,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I pieced together fragmented, transitory images,

70
0:03:42.88,000 --> 0:03:43,000
consciously analyzed the clues,

71
0:03:44.88,000 --> 0:03:47,000
searched for some logic in my crumbling kaleidoscope,

72
0:03:48.84,000 --> 0:03:49,000
until I saw nothing at all.

73
0:03:51.6,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I learned that what we see

74
0:03:53.28,000 --> 0:03:55,000
is not universal truth.

75
0:03:56.2,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It is not objective reality.

76
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:04,000
What we see is a unique, personal, virtual reality

77
0:04:04.72,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that is masterfully constructed by our brain.

78
0:04:07.56,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Let me explain with a bit of amateur neuroscience.

79
0:04:09.918,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Your visual cortex takes up about 30 percent of your brain.

80
0:04:13.56,000 --> 0:04:16,000
That's compared to approximately eight percent for touch

81
0:04:17.04,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and two to three percent for hearing.

82
0:04:19.6,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Every second, your eyes can send your visual cortex

83
0:04:23.36,000 --> 0:04:25,000
as many as two billion pieces of information.

84
0:04:26.36,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The rest of your body can send your brain only an additional billion.

85
0:04:30.68,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So sight is one third of your brain by volume

86
0:04:34.92,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and can claim about two thirds of your brain's processing resources.

87
0:04:39.04,000 --> 0:04:4,000
It's no surprise then

88
0:04:40.28,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that the illusion of sight is so compelling.

89
0:04:42.4,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But make no mistake about it: sight is an illusion.

90
0:04:45.92,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Here's where it gets interesting.

91
0:04:47.76,000 --> 0:04:49,000
To create the experience of sight,

92
0:04:49.88,000 --> 0:04:52,000
your brain references your conceptual understanding of the world,

93
0:04:53.44,000 --> 0:04:57,000
other knowledge, your memories, opinions, emotions, mental attention.

94
0:04:57.52,000 --> 0:05:01,000
All of these things and far more are linked in your brain to your sight.

95
0:05:03.04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
These linkages work both ways, and usually occur subconsciously.

96
0:05:06.48,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So for example,

97
0:05:08.36,000 --> 0:05:1,000
what you see impacts how you feel,

98
0:05:10.52,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and the way you feel can literally change what you see.

99
0:05:14.04,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Numerous studies demonstrate this.

100
0:05:16.6,000 --> 0:05:17,000
If you are asked to estimate

101
0:05:18.48,000 --> 0:05:21,000
the walking speed of a man in a video, for example,

102
0:05:21.68,000 --> 0:05:25,000
your answer will be different if you're told to think about cheetahs or turtles.

103
0:05:27.12,000 --> 0:05:3,000
A hill appears steeper if you've just exercised,

104
0:05:30.44,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and a landmark appears farther away

105
0:05:32.68,000 --> 0:05:33,000
if you're wearing a heavy backpack.

106
0:05:35.96,000 --> 0:05:37,000
We have arrived at a fundamental contradiction.

107
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
What you see is a complex mental construction of your own making,

108
0:05:44.6,000 --> 0:05:45,000
but you experience it passively

109
0:05:46.4,000 --> 0:05:48,000
as a direct representation of the world around you.

110
0:05:49.68,000 --> 0:05:51,000
You create your own reality, and you believe it.

111
0:05:53.56,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I believed mine until it broke apart.

112
0:05:56.92,000 --> 0:05:58,000
The deterioration of my eyes shattered the illusion.

113
0:06:00.72,000 --> 0:06:02,000
You see, sight is just one way

114
0:06:03.04,000 --> 0:06:04,000
we shape our reality.

115
0:06:05.28,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We create our own realities in many other ways.

116
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Let's take fear as just one example.

117
0:06:13.44,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Your fears distort your reality.

118
0:06:17.88,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Under the warped logic of fear, anything is better than the uncertain.

119
0:06:22.08,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Fear fills the void at all costs,

120
0:06:24.56,000 --> 0:06:26,000
passing off what you dread for what you know,

121
0:06:26.72,000 --> 0:06:28,000
offering up the worst in place of the ambiguous,

122
0:06:29.52,000 --> 0:06:3,000
substituting assumption for reason.

123
0:06:32.12,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Psychologists have a great term for it: awfulizing.

124
0:06:34.88,000 --> 0:06:35,000
(Laughter)

125
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Right?

126
0:06:37.56,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Fear replaces the unknown with the awful.

127
0:06:42.08,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Now, fear is self-realizing.

128
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:45,000
When you face the greatest need

129
0:06:45.76,000 --> 0:06:47,000
to look outside yourself and think critically,

130
0:06:48.44,000 --> 0:06:5,000
fear beats a retreat deep inside your mind,

131
0:06:51.28,000 --> 0:06:52,000
shrinking and distorting your view,

132
0:06:53.08,000 --> 0:06:55,000
drowning your capacity for critical thought

133
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
with a flood of disruptive emotions.

134
0:06:57.88,000 --> 0:06:59,000
When you face a compelling opportunity to take action,

135
0:07:00.76,000 --> 0:07:02,000
fear lulls you into inaction,

136
0:07:03.28,000 --> 0:07:06,000
enticing you to passively watch its prophecies fulfill themselves.

137
0:07:09.88,000 --> 0:07:11,000
When I was diagnosed with my blinding disease,

138
0:07:12.12,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I knew blindness would ruin my life.

139
0:07:16.4,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Blindness was a death sentence for my independence.

140
0:07:19.36,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It was the end of achievement for me.

141
0:07:22.6,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Blindness meant I would live an unremarkable life,

142
0:07:26.6,000 --> 0:07:27,000
small and sad,

143
0:07:28.32,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and likely alone.

144
0:07:30.28,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I knew it.

145
0:07:33.44,000 --> 0:07:35,000
This was a fiction born of my fears, but I believed it.

146
0:07:36.8,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It was a lie, but it was my reality,

147
0:07:39.44,000 --> 0:07:42,000
just like those backwards-swimming fish in little Dorothy's mind.

148
0:07:43.92,000 --> 0:07:45,000
If I had not confronted the reality of my fear,

149
0:07:46.44,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I would have lived it.

150
0:07:48.2,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I am certain of that.

151
0:07:51.92,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So how do you live your life eyes wide open?

152
0:07:55.48,000 --> 0:07:56,000
It is a learned discipline.

153
0:07:57.52,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It can be taught. It can be practiced.

154
0:08:00.68,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I will summarize very briefly.

155
0:08:03.64,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Hold yourself accountable

156
0:08:05.56,000 --> 0:08:07,000
for every moment, every thought,

157
0:08:08.08,000 --> 0:08:09,000
every detail.

158
0:08:10.12,000 --> 0:08:11,000
See beyond your fears.

159
0:08:11.8,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Recognize your assumptions.

160
0:08:13.56,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Harness your internal strength.

161
0:08:15.36,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Silence your internal critic.

162
0:08:17.56,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Correct your misconceptions about luck and about success.

163
0:08:21.48,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Accept your strengths and your weaknesses, and understand the difference.

164
0:08:25.6,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Open your hearts

165
0:08:26.92,000 --> 0:08:27,000
to your bountiful blessings.

166
0:08:29.48,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Your fears, your critics,

167
0:08:31.72,000 --> 0:08:32,000
your heroes, your villains --

168
0:08:33.6,000 --> 0:08:36,000
they are your excuses,

169
0:08:36.64,000 --> 0:08:38,000
rationalizations, shortcuts,

170
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:41,000
justifications, your surrender.

171
0:08:42.36,000 --> 0:08:44,000
They are fictions you perceive as reality.

172
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Choose to see through them.

173
0:08:47.679,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Choose to let them go.

174
0:08:50.08,000 --> 0:08:52,000
You are the creator of your reality.

175
0:08:54.24,000 --> 0:08:57,000
With that empowerment comes complete responsibility.

176
0:08:58.44,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I chose to step out of fear's tunnel into terrain uncharted and undefined.

177
0:09:04.44,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I chose to build there a blessed life.

178
0:09:08.12,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Far from alone,

179
0:09:09.92,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I share my beautiful life with Dorothy,

180
0:09:12.92,000 --> 0:09:13,000
my beautiful wife,

181
0:09:14.6,000 --> 0:09:16,000
with our triplets, whom we call the Tripskys,

182
0:09:18.4,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and with the latest addition to the family,

183
0:09:20.44,000 --> 0:09:21,000
sweet baby Clementine.

184
0:09:22.84,000 --> 0:09:23,000
What do you fear?

185
0:09:25.6,000 --> 0:09:26,000
What lies do you tell yourself?

186
0:09:28.52,000 --> 0:09:3,000
How do you embellish your truth and write your own fictions?

187
0:09:32.36,000 --> 0:09:34,000
What reality are you creating for yourself?

188
0:09:36.2,000 --> 0:09:39,000
In your career and personal life, in your relationships,

189
0:09:39.4,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and in your heart and soul,

190
0:09:41.04,000 --> 0:09:43,000
your backwards-swimming fish do you great harm.

191
0:09:44.56,000 --> 0:09:47,000
They exact a toll in missed opportunities and unrealized potential,

192
0:09:49.4,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and they engender insecurity and distrust

193
0:09:51.8,000 --> 0:09:53,000
where you seek fulfillment and connection.

194
0:09:55.56,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I urge you to search them out.

195
0:09:59.36,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Helen Keller said that the only thing worse than being blind

196
0:10:03.56,000 --> 0:10:05,000
is having sight but no vision.

197
0:10:06.92,000 --> 0:10:09,000
For me, going blind was a profound blessing,

198
0:10:10.72,000 --> 0:10:12,000
because blindness gave me vision.

199
0:10:13.72,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I hope you can see what I see.

200
0:10:16.28,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Thank you.

201
0:10:17.52,000 --> 0:10:19,000
(Applause)

202
0:10:32.72,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Bruno Giussani: Isaac, before you leave the stage, just a question.

203
0:10:35.92,000 --> 0:10:38,000
This is an audience of entrepreneurs, of doers, of innovators.

204
0:10:39.72,000 --> 0:10:42,000
You are a CEO of a company down in Florida,

205
0:10:43.4,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and many are probably wondering,

206
0:10:45.56,000 --> 0:10:47,000
how is it to be a blind CEO?

207
0:10:47.8,000 --> 0:10:5,000
What kind of specific challenges do you have, and how do you overcome them?

208
0:10:51.6,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Isaac Lidsky: Well, the biggest challenge became a blessing.

209
0:10:54.76,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I don't get visual feedback from people.

210
0:10:57.88,000 --> 0:10:59,000
(Laughter)

211
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:02,000
BG: What's that noise there? IL: Yeah.

212
0:11:02.2,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So, for example, in my leadership team meetings,

213
0:11:05.72,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I don't see facial expressions or gestures.

214
0:11:09.64,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I've learned to solicit a lot more verbal feedback.

215
0:11:13.4,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I basically force people to tell me what they think.

216
0:11:18.08,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And in this respect,

217
0:11:19.96,000 --> 0:11:23,000
it's become, like I said, a real blessing for me personally and for my company,

218
0:11:24.08,000 --> 0:11:26,000
because we communicate at a far deeper level,

219
0:11:27.4,000 --> 0:11:28,000
we avoid ambiguities,

220
0:11:30.08,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and most important, my team knows that what they think truly matters.

221
0:11:38.56,000 --> 0:11:4,000
BG: Isaac, thank you for coming to TED. IL: Thank you, Bruno.

222
0:11:41.48,000 --> 0:11:44,000
(Applause)

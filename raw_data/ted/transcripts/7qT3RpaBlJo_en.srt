1
0:00:13.062,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Good morning.

2
0:00:15.327,000 --> 0:00:16,000
When I was a little boy,

3
0:00:17.114,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I had an experience that changed my life,

4
0:00:20.191,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and is in fact why I'm here today.

5
0:00:23.099,000 --> 0:00:24,000
That one moment

6
0:00:25.04,000 --> 0:00:27,000
profoundly affected how I think about

7
0:00:27.302,000 --> 0:00:3,000
art, design and engineering.

8
0:00:30.523,000 --> 0:00:32,000
As background, I was fortunate enough to grow up

9
0:00:33.28,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in a family of loving and talented artists

10
0:00:36.993,000 --> 0:00:38,000
in one of the world's great cities.

11
0:00:39.557,000 --> 0:00:42,000
My dad, John Ferren, who died when I was 15,

12
0:00:43.434,000 --> 0:00:46,000
was an artist by both passion and profession,

13
0:00:46.964,000 --> 0:00:48,000
as is my mom, Rae.

14
0:00:49.224,000 --> 0:00:5,000
He was one of the New York School

15
0:00:51.029,000 --> 0:00:52,000
abstract expressionists who,

16
0:00:52.79,000 --> 0:00:54,000
together with his contemporaries,

17
0:00:55.302,000 --> 0:00:57,000
invented American modern art,

18
0:00:58.2,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and contributed to moving the American zeitgeist

19
0:01:01.385,000 --> 0:01:05,000
towards modernism in the 20th century.

20
0:01:05.928,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Isn't it remarkable that, after thousands of years

21
0:01:08.849,000 --> 0:01:11,000
of people doing mostly representational art,

22
0:01:12.49,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that modern art, comparatively speaking,

23
0:01:14.523,000 --> 0:01:16,000
is about 15 minutes old,

24
0:01:16.863,000 --> 0:01:17,000
yet now pervasive.

25
0:01:18.761,000 --> 0:01:19,000
As with many other important innovations,

26
0:01:20.705,000 --> 0:01:23,000
those radical ideas required no new technology,

27
0:01:24.325,000 --> 0:01:26,000
just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment,

28
0:01:27.218,000 --> 0:01:31,000
plus resiliency in the face of near-universal criticism

29
0:01:31.386,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and rejection.

30
0:01:32.84,000 --> 0:01:34,000
In our home, art was everywhere.

31
0:01:35.357,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It was like oxygen,

32
0:01:36.928,000 --> 0:01:39,000
around us and necessary for life.

33
0:01:40.09,000 --> 0:01:41,000
As I watched him paint,

34
0:01:41.949,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Dad taught me that art

35
0:01:44.256,000 --> 0:01:46,000
was not about being decorative,

36
0:01:46.465,000 --> 0:01:49,000
but was a different way of communicating ideas,

37
0:01:49.579,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and in fact one that could bridge the worlds

38
0:01:51.616,000 --> 0:01:53,000
of knowledge and insight.

39
0:01:54.544,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Given this rich artistic environment,

40
0:01:56.684,000 --> 0:01:57,000
you'd assume that I would have been compelled

41
0:01:58.299,000 --> 0:02:,000
to go into the family business,

42
0:02:00.408,000 --> 0:02:02,000
but no.

43
0:02:03.024,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I followed the path of most kids

44
0:02:04.811,000 --> 0:02:05,000
who are genetically programmed

45
0:02:06.161,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to make their parents crazy.

46
0:02:08.36,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I had no interest in becoming an artist,

47
0:02:10.983,000 --> 0:02:11,000
certainly not a painter.

48
0:02:12.543,000 --> 0:02:15,000
What I did love was electronics and machines --

49
0:02:15.842,000 --> 0:02:16,000
taking them apart, building new ones,

50
0:02:17.462,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and making them work.

51
0:02:19.349,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Fortunately, my family also had engineers in it,

52
0:02:23.251,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and with my parents,

53
0:02:24.459,000 --> 0:02:26,000
these were my first role models.

54
0:02:27.087,000 --> 0:02:28,000
What they all had in common

55
0:02:28.444,000 --> 0:02:3,000
was they worked very, very hard.

56
0:02:31.152,000 --> 0:02:33,000
My grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal

57
0:02:33.522,000 --> 0:02:35,000
kitchen cabinet factory in Brooklyn.

58
0:02:36.222,000 --> 0:02:39,000
On weekends, we would go together to Cortlandt Street,

59
0:02:39.646,000 --> 0:02:41,000
which was New York City's radio row.

60
0:02:42.321,000 --> 0:02:44,000
There we would explore massive piles

61
0:02:45.124,000 --> 0:02:46,000
of surplus electronics,

62
0:02:46.345,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and for a few bucks bring home treasures

63
0:02:48.647,000 --> 0:02:49,000
like Norden bombsights

64
0:02:50.079,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and parts from the first IBM tube-based computers.

65
0:02:54.59,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I found these objects both useful and fascinating.

66
0:02:57.656,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I learned about engineering and how things worked,

67
0:03:00.287,000 --> 0:03:01,000
not at school

68
0:03:01.747,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but by taking apart and studying

69
0:03:03.536,000 --> 0:03:05,000
these fabulously complex devices.

70
0:03:06.013,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I did this for hours every day,

71
0:03:08.597,000 --> 0:03:11,000
apparently avoiding electrocution.

72
0:03:11.895,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Life was good.

73
0:03:13.467,000 --> 0:03:15,000
However, every summer, sadly,

74
0:03:15.788,000 --> 0:03:17,000
the machines got left behind

75
0:03:17.821,000 --> 0:03:19,000
while my parents and I traveled overseas

76
0:03:20.025,000 --> 0:03:23,000
to experience history, art and design.

77
0:03:23.665,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We visited the great museums and historic buildings

78
0:03:26.059,000 --> 0:03:27,000
of both Europe and the Middle East,

79
0:03:27.919,000 --> 0:03:29,000
but to encourage my growing interest

80
0:03:30.179,000 --> 0:03:31,000
in science and technology,

81
0:03:31.994,000 --> 0:03:33,000
they would simply drop me off in places

82
0:03:34.278,000 --> 0:03:36,000
like the London Science Museum,

83
0:03:36.718,000 --> 0:03:39,000
where I would wander endlessly for hours by myself

84
0:03:40.436,000 --> 0:03:43,000
studying the history of science and technology.

85
0:03:44.412,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Then, when I was about nine years old,

86
0:03:47.676,000 --> 0:03:48,000
we went to Rome.

87
0:03:49.544,000 --> 0:03:51,000
On one particularly hot summer day,

88
0:03:51.905,000 --> 0:03:53,000
we visited a drum-shaped building that from the outside

89
0:03:54.784,000 --> 0:03:56,000
was not particularly interesting.

90
0:03:57.028,000 --> 0:03:59,000
My dad said it was called the Pantheon,

91
0:03:59.353,000 --> 0:04:01,000
a temple for all of the gods.

92
0:04:01.821,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It didn't look all that special from the outside,

93
0:04:04.095,000 --> 0:04:06,000
as I said, but when we walked inside,

94
0:04:06.534,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I was immediately struck by three things:

95
0:04:09.847,000 --> 0:04:12,000
First of all, it was pleasantly cool

96
0:04:13.077,000 --> 0:04:15,000
despite the oppressive heat outside.

97
0:04:15.155,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It was very dark, the only source of light

98
0:04:17.869,000 --> 0:04:19,000
being an big open hole in the roof.

99
0:04:20.342,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Dad explained that this wasn't a big open hole,

100
0:04:22.575,000 --> 0:04:23,000
but it was called the oculus,

101
0:04:24.389,000 --> 0:04:26,000
an eye to the heavens.

102
0:04:26.765,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And there was something about this place,

103
0:04:28.91,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I didn't know why, that just felt special.

104
0:04:31.913,000 --> 0:04:32,000
As we walked to the center of the room,

105
0:04:33.911,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I looked up at the heavens through the oculus.

106
0:04:36.732,000 --> 0:04:38,000
This was the first church that I'd been to

107
0:04:39.029,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that provided an unrestricted view

108
0:04:41.232,000 --> 0:04:44,000
between God and man.

109
0:04:44.39,000 --> 0:04:47,000
But I wondered, what about when it rained?

110
0:04:47.82,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Dad may have called this an oculus,

111
0:04:49.677,000 --> 0:04:52,000
but it was, in fact, a big hole in the roof.

112
0:04:52.764,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I looked down and saw floor drains

113
0:04:54.593,000 --> 0:04:56,000
had been cut into the stone floor.

114
0:04:57.178,000 --> 0:04:59,000
As I became more accustomed to the dark,

115
0:04:59.637,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I was able to make out details of the floor

116
0:05:01.901,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and the surrounding walls.

117
0:05:03.631,000 --> 0:05:05,000
No big deal here, just the same statuary stuff

118
0:05:06.208,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that we'd seen all over Rome.

119
0:05:08.124,000 --> 0:05:09,000
In fact, it looked like the Appian Way

120
0:05:09.796,000 --> 0:05:11,000
marble salesman showed up

121
0:05:11.992,000 --> 0:05:13,000
with his sample book, showed it to Hadrian,

122
0:05:14.44,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and Hadrian said, "We'll take all of it."

123
0:05:17.08,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Laughter)

124
0:05:18.786,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But the ceiling was amazing.

125
0:05:22.004,000 --> 0:05:24,000
It looked like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome.

126
0:05:24.84,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I'd seen these before,

127
0:05:26.149,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and Bucky was friends with my dad.

128
0:05:28.393,000 --> 0:05:31,000
It was modern, high-tech, impressive,

129
0:05:31.884,000 --> 0:05:33,000
a huge 142-foot clear span

130
0:05:34.321,000 --> 0:05:37,000
which, not coincidentally, was exactly its height.

131
0:05:37.564,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I loved this place.

132
0:05:38.826,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It was really beautiful and unlike anything I'd ever seen before,

133
0:05:42.245,000 --> 0:05:45,000
so I asked my dad, "When was this built?"

134
0:05:45.815,000 --> 0:05:48,000
He said, "About 2,000 years ago."

135
0:05:48.947,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And I said, "No, I mean, the roof."

136
0:05:51.451,000 --> 0:05:52,000
You see, I assumed that this was a modern roof

137
0:05:53.41,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that had been put on because the original

138
0:05:55.328,000 --> 0:05:58,000
was destroyed in some long-past war.

139
0:05:58.874,000 --> 0:06:01,000
He said, "It's the original roof."

140
0:06:02.336,000 --> 0:06:04,000
That moment changed my life,

141
0:06:04.814,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and I can remember it as if it were yesterday.

142
0:06:07.463,000 --> 0:06:09,000
For the first time, I realized people were smart

143
0:06:10.058,000 --> 0:06:12,000
2,000 years ago. (Laughter)

144
0:06:12.198,000 --> 0:06:14,000
This had never crossed my mind.

145
0:06:14.312,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I mean, to me, the pyramids at Giza,

146
0:06:18.183,000 --> 0:06:19,000
we visited those the year before,

147
0:06:20.111,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and sure they're impressive, nice enough design,

148
0:06:23.031,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but look, give me an unlimited budget,

149
0:06:25.486,000 --> 0:06:28,000
20,000 to 40,000 laborers, and about 10 to 20 years

150
0:06:29.483,000 --> 0:06:32,000
to cut and drag stone blocks across the countryside,

151
0:06:33.099,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and I'll build you pyramids too.

152
0:06:35.863,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But no amount of brute force

153
0:06:38.666,000 --> 0:06:41,000
gets you the dome of the Pantheon,

154
0:06:41.708,000 --> 0:06:44,000
not 2,000 years ago, nor today.

155
0:06:44.727,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And incidentally, it is still the largest

156
0:06:47.467,000 --> 0:06:5,000
unreinforced concrete dome that's ever been built.

157
0:06:51.281,000 --> 0:06:53,000
To build the Pantheon took some miracles.

158
0:06:54.276,000 --> 0:06:56,000
By miracles, I mean things that are

159
0:06:56.708,000 --> 0:06:58,000
technically barely possible,

160
0:06:59.295,000 --> 0:07:02,000
very high-risk, and might not be

161
0:07:02.367,000 --> 0:07:04,000
actually accomplishable at this moment in time,

162
0:07:04.951,000 --> 0:07:08,000
certainly not by you.

163
0:07:09.203,000 --> 0:07:12,000
For example, here are some of the Pantheon's miracles.

164
0:07:12.328,000 --> 0:07:14,000
To make it even structurally possible,

165
0:07:15.021,000 --> 0:07:17,000
they had to invent super-strong concrete,

166
0:07:17.588,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and to control weight,

167
0:07:19.537,000 --> 0:07:21,000
varied the density of the aggregate

168
0:07:21.605,000 --> 0:07:23,000
as they worked their way up the dome.

169
0:07:24.373,000 --> 0:07:26,000
For strength and lightness, the dome structure

170
0:07:26.674,000 --> 0:07:28,000
used five rings of coffers,

171
0:07:28.711,000 --> 0:07:29,000
each of diminishing size,

172
0:07:30.318,000 --> 0:07:32,000
which imparts a dramatic forced perspective

173
0:07:33.054,000 --> 0:07:35,000
to the design.

174
0:07:35.061,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It was wonderfully cool inside

175
0:07:36.986,000 --> 0:07:38,000
because of its huge thermal mass,

176
0:07:39.169,000 --> 0:07:41,000
natural convection of air rising up

177
0:07:41.254,000 --> 0:07:42,000
through the oculus,

178
0:07:42.655,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and a Venturi effect when wind blows across

179
0:07:45.13,000 --> 0:07:47,000
the top of the building.

180
0:07:47.433,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I discovered for the first time that light itself

181
0:07:51.393,000 --> 0:07:52,000
has substance.

182
0:07:53.36,000 --> 0:07:55,000
The shaft of light beaming through the oculus

183
0:07:56.037,000 --> 0:07:58,000
was both beautiful and palpable,

184
0:07:58.527,000 --> 0:08:,000
and I realized for the first time

185
0:08:00.784,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that light could be designed.

186
0:08:02.685,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Further, that of all of the forms of design,

187
0:08:07.559,000 --> 0:08:08,000
visual design,

188
0:08:08.935,000 --> 0:08:09,000
they were all kind of irrelevant without it,

189
0:08:10.766,000 --> 0:08:13,000
because without light, you can't see any of them.

190
0:08:14.627,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I also realized that I wasn't the first person

191
0:08:17.079,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to think that this place was really special.

192
0:08:20.338,000 --> 0:08:24,000
It survived gravity, barbarians, looters, developers

193
0:08:24.715,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and the ravages of time to become

194
0:08:26.614,000 --> 0:08:27,000
what I believe is the longest

195
0:08:27.994,000 --> 0:08:29,000
continuously occupied building in history.

196
0:08:30.951,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Largely because of that visit,

197
0:08:33.167,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I came to understand that,

198
0:08:34.704,000 --> 0:08:36,000
contrary to what I was being told in school,

199
0:08:37.343,000 --> 0:08:39,000
the worlds of art and design

200
0:08:39.372,000 --> 0:08:41,000
were not, in fact, incompatible

201
0:08:41.388,000 --> 0:08:42,000
with science and engineering.

202
0:08:43.064,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I realized, when combined,

203
0:08:45.157,000 --> 0:08:47,000
you could create things that were amazing

204
0:08:47.92,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that couldn't be done in either domain alone.

205
0:08:50.766,000 --> 0:08:52,000
But in school, with few exceptions,

206
0:08:53.199,000 --> 0:08:54,000
they were treated as separate worlds,

207
0:08:55.119,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and they still are.

208
0:08:57.262,000 --> 0:08:59,000
My teachers told me that I had to get serious

209
0:08:59.958,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and focus on one or the other.

210
0:09:02.131,000 --> 0:09:05,000
However, urging me to specialize

211
0:09:05.226,000 --> 0:09:08,000
only caused me to really appreciate those polymaths

212
0:09:08.536,000 --> 0:09:12,000
like Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci,

213
0:09:12.686,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Benjamin Franklin,

214
0:09:14.111,000 --> 0:09:16,000
people who did exactly the opposite.

215
0:09:16.821,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And this led me to embrace

216
0:09:19.01,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and want to be in both worlds.

217
0:09:21.98,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity

218
0:09:27.808,000 --> 0:09:29,000
like the Pantheon actually happen?

219
0:09:30.302,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Someone themselves, perhaps Hadrian,

220
0:09:34.23,000 --> 0:09:37,000
needed a brilliant creative vision.

221
0:09:37.421,000 --> 0:09:39,000
They also needed the storytelling and leadership skills

222
0:09:40.214,000 --> 0:09:42,000
necessary to fund and execute it,

223
0:09:42.992,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and a mastery of science and technology

224
0:09:45.854,000 --> 0:09:47,000
with the ability and knowhow

225
0:09:47.937,000 --> 0:09:51,000
to push existing innovations even farther.

226
0:09:51.983,000 --> 0:09:54,000
It is my belief that to create these rare game changers

227
0:09:55.903,000 --> 0:09:59,000
requires you to pull off at least five miracles.

228
0:10:00.033,000 --> 0:10:02,000
The problem is, no matter how talented,

229
0:10:02.726,000 --> 0:10:03,000
rich or smart you are,

230
0:10:04.458,000 --> 0:10:07,000
you only get one to one and a half miracles.

231
0:10:07.484,000 --> 0:10:08,000
That's it. That's the quota.

232
0:10:09.266,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Then you run out of time, money, enthusiasm,

233
0:10:11.879,000 --> 0:10:12,000
whatever.

234
0:10:13.258,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Remember, most people can't even imagine

235
0:10:15.535,000 --> 0:10:16,000
one of these technical miracles,

236
0:10:17.442,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and you need at least five to make a Pantheon.

237
0:10:20.551,000 --> 0:10:22,000
In my experience, these rare visionaries

238
0:10:23.052,000 --> 0:10:24,000
who can think across the worlds of art,

239
0:10:24.889,000 --> 0:10:25,000
design and engineering

240
0:10:26.716,000 --> 0:10:28,000
have the ability to notice

241
0:10:28.918,000 --> 0:10:3,000
when others have provided enough of the miracles

242
0:10:31.635,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to bring the goal within reach.

243
0:10:34.191,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Driven by the clarity of their vision,

244
0:10:36.828,000 --> 0:10:38,000
they summon the courage and determination

245
0:10:39.138,000 --> 0:10:41,000
to deliver the remaining miracles

246
0:10:41.235,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and they often take what other people think to be

247
0:10:44.785,000 --> 0:10:46,000
insurmountable obstacles

248
0:10:46.831,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and turn them into features.

249
0:10:48.616,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Take the oculus of the Pantheon.

250
0:10:51.543,000 --> 0:10:52,000
By insisting that it be in the design,

251
0:10:53.441,000 --> 0:10:55,000
it meant you couldn't use much of the structural technology

252
0:10:56.314,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that had been developed for Roman arches.

253
0:10:59.288,000 --> 0:11:01,000
However, by instead embracing it

254
0:11:02.186,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and rethinking weight and stress distribution,

255
0:11:04.774,000 --> 0:11:06,000
they came up with a design that only works

256
0:11:07.256,000 --> 0:11:08,000
if there's a big hole in the roof.

257
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
That done, you now get the aesthetic

258
0:11:12.167,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and design benefits of light, cooling

259
0:11:16.548,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and that critical direct connection with the heavens.

260
0:11:19.848,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Not bad.

261
0:11:21.892,000 --> 0:11:23,000
These people not only believed

262
0:11:23.953,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that the impossible can be done,

263
0:11:26.009,000 --> 0:11:28,000
but that it must be done.

264
0:11:28.835,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Enough ancient history.

265
0:11:30.936,000 --> 0:11:33,000
What are some recent examples of innovations

266
0:11:34.069,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that combine creative design

267
0:11:35.948,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and technological advances in a way so profound

268
0:11:39.191,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that they will be remembered

269
0:11:40.52,000 --> 0:11:41,000
a thousand years from now?

270
0:11:42.353,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Well, putting a man on the moon was a good one,

271
0:11:45.449,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and returning him safely to Earth wasn't bad either.

272
0:11:48.466,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Talk about one giant leap:

273
0:11:50.958,000 --> 0:11:52,000
It's hard to imagine a more profound moment

274
0:11:53.406,000 --> 0:11:54,000
in human history

275
0:11:54.718,000 --> 0:11:56,000
than when we first left our world

276
0:11:56.891,000 --> 0:11:57,000
to set foot on another.

277
0:11:58.782,000 --> 0:12:,000
So what came after the moon?

278
0:12:01.003,000 --> 0:12:03,000
One is tempted to say that today's pantheon

279
0:12:03.811,000 --> 0:12:04,000
is the Internet,

280
0:12:05.472,000 --> 0:12:07,000
but I actually think that's quite wrong,

281
0:12:07.941,000 --> 0:12:09,000
or at least it's only part of the story.

282
0:12:10.796,000 --> 0:12:12,000
The Internet isn't a Pantheon.

283
0:12:13.312,000 --> 0:12:15,000
It's more like the invention of concrete:

284
0:12:15.903,000 --> 0:12:17,000
important, absolutely necessary

285
0:12:18.478,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to build the Pantheon,

286
0:12:19.918,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and enduring,

287
0:12:21.274,000 --> 0:12:24,000
but entirely insufficient by itself.

288
0:12:24.465,000 --> 0:12:26,000
However, just as the technology of concrete

289
0:12:27.397,000 --> 0:12:3,000
was critical in realization of the Pantheon,

290
0:12:30.984,000 --> 0:12:33,000
new designers will use the technologies of the Internet

291
0:12:34.199,000 --> 0:12:37,000
to create novel concepts that will endure.

292
0:12:37.397,000 --> 0:12:39,000
The smartphone is a perfect example.

293
0:12:39.455,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Soon the majority of people on the planet

294
0:12:41.2,000 --> 0:12:42,000
will have one,

295
0:12:42.534,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and the idea of connecting everyone

296
0:12:44.935,000 --> 0:12:47,000
to both knowledge and each other will endure.

297
0:12:48.185,000 --> 0:12:49,000
So what's next?

298
0:12:49.493,000 --> 0:12:52,000
What imminent advance will be the equivalent of the Pantheon?

299
0:12:52.899,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Thinking about this,

300
0:12:54.334,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I rejected many very plausible

301
0:12:56.881,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and dramatic breakthroughs to come,

302
0:12:58.777,000 --> 0:13:,000
such as curing cancer.

303
0:13:00.794,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Why? Because Pantheons are anchored

304
0:13:04.132,000 --> 0:13:06,000
in designed physical objects,

305
0:13:07.067,000 --> 0:13:09,000
ones that inspire by simply seeing

306
0:13:09.389,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and experiencing them,

307
0:13:10.809,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and will continue to do so indefinitely.

308
0:13:13.691,000 --> 0:13:17,000
It is a different kind of language, like art.

309
0:13:18.264,000 --> 0:13:2,000
These other vital contributions that extend life

310
0:13:21.036,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and relieve suffering are, of course, critical,

311
0:13:23.729,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and fantastic,

312
0:13:25.416,000 --> 0:13:26,000
but they're part of the continuum of

313
0:13:27.209,000 --> 0:13:29,000
our overall knowledge and technology,

314
0:13:29.721,000 --> 0:13:31,000
like the Internet.

315
0:13:32.245,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So what is next?

316
0:13:34.589,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Perhaps counterintuitively,

317
0:13:36.308,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I'm guessing it's a visionary idea

318
0:13:38.62,000 --> 0:13:39,000
from the late 1930s

319
0:13:40.474,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that's been revived every decade since:

320
0:13:43.634,000 --> 0:13:45,000
autonomous vehicles.

321
0:13:45.648,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Now you're thinking, give me a break.

322
0:13:47.386,000 --> 0:13:5,000
How can a fancy version of cruise control

323
0:13:50.904,000 --> 0:13:51,000
be profound?

324
0:13:52.604,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Look, much of our world

325
0:13:54.728,000 --> 0:13:57,000
has been designed around roads and transportation.

326
0:13:58.211,000 --> 0:13:59,000
These were as essential to the success

327
0:14:00.086,000 --> 0:14:01,000
of the Roman Empire

328
0:14:01.584,000 --> 0:14:02,000
as the interstate highway system

329
0:14:03.569,000 --> 0:14:04,000
to the prosperity and development

330
0:14:05.363,000 --> 0:14:07,000
of the United States.

331
0:14:07.573,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Today, these roads that interconnect our world

332
0:14:10.607,000 --> 0:14:12,000
are dominated by cars and trucks

333
0:14:12.705,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that have remained largely unchanged

334
0:14:14.573,000 --> 0:14:16,000
for 100 years.

335
0:14:17.144,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Although perhaps not obvious today,

336
0:14:20.403,000 --> 0:14:24,000
autonomous vehicles will be the key technology

337
0:14:24.988,000 --> 0:14:27,000
that enables us to redesign our cities

338
0:14:28.086,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and, by extension, civilization.

339
0:14:30.305,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Here's why:

340
0:14:31.907,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Once they become ubiquitous,

341
0:14:33.66,000 --> 0:14:35,000
each year, these vehicles will save

342
0:14:36.197,000 --> 0:14:39,000
tens of thousands of lives in the United States alone

343
0:14:39.305,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and a million globally.

344
0:14:42.432,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Automotive energy consumption and air pollution

345
0:14:45.331,000 --> 0:14:47,000
will be cut dramatically.

346
0:14:47.704,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Much of the road congestion

347
0:14:49.109,000 --> 0:14:52,000
in and out of our cities will disappear.

348
0:14:52.919,000 --> 0:14:54,000
They will enable compelling new concepts

349
0:14:55.606,000 --> 0:14:57,000
in how we design cities, work,

350
0:14:58.075,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and the way we live.

351
0:15:00.012,000 --> 0:15:02,000
We will get where we're going faster

352
0:15:02.558,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and society will recapture vast amounts

353
0:15:05.556,000 --> 0:15:06,000
of lost productivity

354
0:15:06.847,000 --> 0:15:09,000
now spent sitting in traffic basically polluting.

355
0:15:10.488,000 --> 0:15:13,000
But why now? Why do we think this is ready?

356
0:15:13.761,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Because over the last 30 years,

357
0:15:15.955,000 --> 0:15:17,000
people from outside the automotive industry

358
0:15:18.003,000 --> 0:15:2,000
have spent countless billions

359
0:15:20.111,000 --> 0:15:21,000
creating the needed miracles,

360
0:15:21.846,000 --> 0:15:23,000
but for entirely different purposes.

361
0:15:24.718,000 --> 0:15:26,000
It took folks like DARPA, universities,

362
0:15:27.346,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and companies completely outside of the automotive industry

363
0:15:30.51,000 --> 0:15:32,000
to notice that if you were clever about it,

364
0:15:32.811,000 --> 0:15:34,000
autonomy could be done now.

365
0:15:35.341,000 --> 0:15:38,000
So what are the five miracles needed for autonomous vehicles?

366
0:15:38.724,000 --> 0:15:39,000
One, you need to know

367
0:15:40.367,000 --> 0:15:42,000
where you are and exactly what time it is.

368
0:15:43.101,000 --> 0:15:45,000
This was solved neatly by the GPS system,

369
0:15:45.509,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Global Positioning System,

370
0:15:46.821,000 --> 0:15:48,000
that the U.S. Government put in place.

371
0:15:49.487,000 --> 0:15:51,000
You need to know where all the roads are,

372
0:15:52.01,000 --> 0:15:54,000
what the rules are, and where you're going.

373
0:15:54.913,000 --> 0:15:56,000
The various needs of personal navigation systems,

374
0:15:57.496,000 --> 0:15:58,000
in-car navigation systems,

375
0:15:59.251,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and web-based maps address this.

376
0:16:02.284,000 --> 0:16:04,000
You must have near-continuous communication

377
0:16:04.911,000 --> 0:16:05,000
with high-performance computing networks

378
0:16:06.804,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and with others nearby

379
0:16:08.474,000 --> 0:16:11,000
to understand their intent.

380
0:16:11.789,000 --> 0:16:14,000
The wireless technologies developed for mobile devices,

381
0:16:14.897,000 --> 0:16:15,000
with some minor modifications,

382
0:16:16.69,000 --> 0:16:18,000
are completely suitable to solve this.

383
0:16:19.649,000 --> 0:16:21,000
You'll probably want some restricted roadways

384
0:16:22.139,000 --> 0:16:23,000
to get started

385
0:16:23.329,000 --> 0:16:25,000
that both society and its lawyers

386
0:16:25.807,000 --> 0:16:26,000
agree are safe to use for this.

387
0:16:27.679,000 --> 0:16:28,000
This will start with the HOV lanes

388
0:16:29.528,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and move from there.

389
0:16:31.661,000 --> 0:16:33,000
But finally, you need to recognize

390
0:16:34.212,000 --> 0:16:36,000
people, signs and objects.

391
0:16:36.315,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Machine vision, special sensors, and high-performance computing

392
0:16:39.369,000 --> 0:16:4,000
can do a lot of this,

393
0:16:40.941,000 --> 0:16:42,000
but it turns out a lot is not good enough

394
0:16:43.499,000 --> 0:16:44,000
when your family is on board.

395
0:16:45.44,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Occasionally, humans will need to do sense-making.

396
0:16:48.961,000 --> 0:16:51,000
For this, you might actually have to wake up

397
0:16:52.573,000 --> 0:16:54,000
your passenger and ask them what the hell

398
0:16:54.669,000 --> 0:16:56,000
that big lump is in the middle of the road.

399
0:16:57.487,000 --> 0:16:59,000
Not so bad, and it will give us a sense of purpose

400
0:16:59.831,000 --> 0:17:,000
in this new world.

401
0:17:01.684,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Besides, once the first drivers explain

402
0:17:04.424,000 --> 0:17:05,000
to their confused car

403
0:17:05.75,000 --> 0:17:07,000
that the giant chicken at the fork in the road

404
0:17:08.416,000 --> 0:17:09,000
is actually a restaurant,

405
0:17:09.959,000 --> 0:17:11,000
and it's okay to keep driving,

406
0:17:12.263,000 --> 0:17:15,000
every other car on the surface of the Earth

407
0:17:15.683,000 --> 0:17:17,000
will know that from that point on.

408
0:17:18.605,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Five miracles, mostly delivered,

409
0:17:20.868,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and now you just need a clear vision

410
0:17:22.746,000 --> 0:17:24,000
of a better world filled with autonomous vehicles

411
0:17:25.583,000 --> 0:17:28,000
with seductively beautiful and new functional designs

412
0:17:29.196,000 --> 0:17:31,000
plus a lot of money and hard work

413
0:17:31.65,000 --> 0:17:32,000
to bring it home.

414
0:17:33.246,000 --> 0:17:36,000
The beginning is now only a handful of years away,

415
0:17:36.268,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and I predict that autonomous vehicles

416
0:17:38.136,000 --> 0:17:4,000
will permanently change our world

417
0:17:40.207,000 --> 0:17:44,000
over the next several decades.

418
0:17:44.391,000 --> 0:17:46,000
In conclusion, I've come to believe

419
0:17:47.043,000 --> 0:17:49,000
that the ingredients for the next Pantheons

420
0:17:49.281,000 --> 0:17:5,000
are all around us,

421
0:17:50.668,000 --> 0:17:52,000
just waiting for visionary people

422
0:17:52.855,000 --> 0:17:53,000
with the broad knowledge,

423
0:17:54.589,000 --> 0:17:55,000
multidisciplinary skills,

424
0:17:56.199,000 --> 0:17:57,000
and intense passion

425
0:17:58.067,000 --> 0:18:03,000
to harness them to make their dreams a reality.

426
0:18:03.153,000 --> 0:18:05,000
But these people don't spontaneously

427
0:18:05.649,000 --> 0:18:06,000
pop into existence.

428
0:18:06.988,000 --> 0:18:07,000
They need to be nurtured and encouraged

429
0:18:08.827,000 --> 0:18:09,000
from when they're little kids.

430
0:18:10.606,000 --> 0:18:11,000
We need to love them and help them

431
0:18:12.466,000 --> 0:18:13,000
discover their passions.

432
0:18:14.185,000 --> 0:18:16,000
We need to encourage them to work hard

433
0:18:16.399,000 --> 0:18:18,000
and help them understand that failure

434
0:18:18.836,000 --> 0:18:2,000
is a necessary ingredient for success,

435
0:18:21.707,000 --> 0:18:23,000
as is perseverance.

436
0:18:23.888,000 --> 0:18:26,000
We need to help them to find their own role models,

437
0:18:26.986,000 --> 0:18:28,000
and give them the confidence to believe in themselves

438
0:18:29.658,000 --> 0:18:31,000
and to believe that anything is possible,

439
0:18:32.435,000 --> 0:18:35,000
and just as my grandpa did when he took me shopping for surplus,

440
0:18:35.944,000 --> 0:18:36,000
and just as my parents did

441
0:18:37.727,000 --> 0:18:39,000
when they took me to science museums,

442
0:18:39.749,000 --> 0:18:42,000
we need to encourage them to find their own path,

443
0:18:43.03,000 --> 0:18:45,000
even if it's very different from our own.

444
0:18:45.687,000 --> 0:18:46,000
But a cautionary note:

445
0:18:47.095,000 --> 0:18:49,000
We also need to periodically pry them away

446
0:18:49.529,000 --> 0:18:5,000
from their modern miracles,

447
0:18:50.998,000 --> 0:18:51,000
the computers, phones, tablets,

448
0:18:52.969,000 --> 0:18:53,000
game machines and TVs,

449
0:18:54.563,000 --> 0:18:56,000
take them out into the sunlight

450
0:18:56.807,000 --> 0:18:58,000
so they can experience both the natural

451
0:18:58.936,000 --> 0:19:,000
and design wonders of our world,

452
0:19:01.833,000 --> 0:19:03,000
our planet and our civilization.

453
0:19:04.075,000 --> 0:19:06,000
If we don't, they won't understand

454
0:19:07.002,000 --> 0:19:08,000
what these precious things are

455
0:19:08.884,000 --> 0:19:1,000
that someday they will be resopnsible

456
0:19:11.479,000 --> 0:19:13,000
for protecting and improving.

457
0:19:13.761,000 --> 0:19:14,000
We also need them to understand

458
0:19:15.404,000 --> 0:19:18,000
something that doesn't seem adequately appreciated

459
0:19:18.433,000 --> 0:19:2,000
in our increasingly tech-dependent world,

460
0:19:20.896,000 --> 0:19:21,000
that art and design

461
0:19:22.579,000 --> 0:19:23,000
are not luxuries,

462
0:19:24.492,000 --> 0:19:25,000
nor somehow incompatible

463
0:19:26.318,000 --> 0:19:27,000
with science and engineering.

464
0:19:28.187,000 --> 0:19:33,000
They are in fact essential to what makes us special.

465
0:19:33.762,000 --> 0:19:35,000
Someday, if you get the chance,

466
0:19:36.277,000 --> 0:19:37,000
perhaps you can take your kids

467
0:19:37.814,000 --> 0:19:38,000
to the actual Pantheon,

468
0:19:39.585,000 --> 0:19:41,000
as we will our daughter Kira,

469
0:19:42.245,000 --> 0:19:44,000
to experience firsthand

470
0:19:44.323,000 --> 0:19:48,000
the power of that astonishing design,

471
0:19:48.58,000 --> 0:19:51,000
which on one otherwise unremarkable day in Rome,

472
0:19:52.324,000 --> 0:19:55,000
reached 2,000 years into the future

473
0:19:55.351,000 --> 0:19:57,000
to set the course for my life.

474
0:19:58.009,000 --> 0:20:,000
Thank you.

475
0:20:00.14,000 --> 0:20:04,000
(Applause)

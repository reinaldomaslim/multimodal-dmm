[This talk contains mature content Viewer discretion is advised]

2
0:00:16.825,000 --> 0:00:2,000
My specialty, as a sex educator, is I bring the science.

3
0:00:22.076,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But my first and most important job is that I stay neutral

4
0:00:26.141,000 --> 0:00:28,000
when I talk about anything sex-related,

5
0:00:28.53,000 --> 0:00:32,000
no embarrassment, no titillation, no judgment, no shame,

6
0:00:32.776,000 --> 0:00:33,000
no matter where I am.

7
0:00:34.411,000 --> 0:00:37,000
No matter what question you ask me.

8
0:00:38.347,000 --> 0:00:4,000
At the end of a conference in a hotel lobby once,

9
0:00:40.72,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I'm literally on my way out the door and a colleague chases me down.

10
0:00:43.959,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"Emily, I just have a really quick question.

11
0:00:47.061,000 --> 0:00:48,000
A friend of mine --

12
0:00:48.442,000 --> 0:00:49,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:49.617,000 --> 0:00:52,000
wants to know if it's possible to get addicted to her vibrator."

14
0:00:54.085,000 --> 0:00:57,000
The answer is no, but it is possible to get spoiled.

15
0:00:58.284,000 --> 0:01:01,000
A different conference, this one in an outdoor tropical paradise,

16
0:01:01.569,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I'm at the breakfast buffet, and a couple approaches me.

17
0:01:05.54,000 --> 0:01:06,000
"Hi, Emily, we're sorry to interrupt you

18
0:01:07.473,000 --> 0:01:11,000
but we just wanted to ask a quick question about premature ejaculation."

19
0:01:13.092,000 --> 0:01:16,000
"Sure, let me tell you about the stop/start technique."

20
0:01:17.025,000 --> 0:01:18,000
That is my life.

21
0:01:18.526,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I stay neutral when other people might "squick."

22
0:01:22.534,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Squick is an emotion that combines surprise

23
0:01:26.124,000 --> 0:01:28,000
with embarrassment plus some disgust

24
0:01:29.106,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and like, not knowing what to do with your hands.

25
0:01:33.688,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So, it's a product.

26
0:01:35.326,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The reason you experience it

27
0:01:36.704,000 --> 0:01:38,000
is because you spent the first two decades of your life

28
0:01:39.315,000 --> 0:01:43,000
learning that sex is a dangerous and disgusting source of everlasting shame

29
0:01:43.514,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and if you're not really good at it, no one will ever love you.

30
0:01:46.982,000 --> 0:01:47,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:48.696,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So you might squick, hearing me talk about sex

32
0:01:51.482,000 --> 0:01:54,000
while you're sitting in a room full of strangers -- that is normal.

33
0:01:54.649,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I invite you to breathe.

34
0:01:56.014,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Feelings are tunnels.

35
0:01:57.593,000 --> 0:02:,000
We make our way through the darkness to get to the light at the end.

36
0:02:00.816,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And I promise it's worth it.

37
0:02:02.188,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Because I want to share with you today a piece of science

38
0:02:04.911,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that has changed how I think about everything,

39
0:02:07.276,000 --> 0:02:1,000
from the behavior of neurotransmitters in our emotional brain,

40
0:02:11.046,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to the dynamics of our interpersonal relationships.

41
0:02:14.966,000 --> 0:02:15,000
To our judicial system.

42
0:02:17.609,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And it starts with our brain.

43
0:02:19.165,000 --> 0:02:21,000
There's an area of your brain you've probably heard referred to

44
0:02:22.173,000 --> 0:02:23,000
as the "reward center."

45
0:02:23.586,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I think calling it the reward center

46
0:02:25.348,000 --> 0:02:27,000
is a little bit like calling your face your nose.

47
0:02:27.807,000 --> 0:02:29,000
That is one prominent feature,

48
0:02:30.3,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but it ignores some other parts and will leave you really confused

49
0:02:34.18,000 --> 0:02:36,000
if you're trying to understand how faces work.

50
0:02:37.14,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It's actually three intertwined but separable systems.

51
0:02:40.584,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The first system is liking.

52
0:02:42.419,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Which is like reward,

53
0:02:43.595,000 --> 0:02:45,000
so this is the opioid hotspots in your emotional brain.

54
0:02:46.229,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It assesses hedonic impact --

55
0:02:48.729,000 --> 0:02:49,000
"Does this stimulus feel good?

56
0:02:50.293,000 --> 0:02:51,000
How good?

57
0:02:51.478,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Does this stimulus feel bad?

58
0:02:53.061,000 --> 0:02:54,000
How bad?"

59
0:02:54.259,000 --> 0:02:56,000
If you drop sugar water on the tongue of a newborn infant,

60
0:02:57.03,000 --> 0:03:,000
the opioid-liking system sets off fireworks.

61
0:03:00.682,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And then there's the wanting system.

62
0:03:02.444,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Wanting is mediated by this vast dopaminergic network

63
0:03:06.262,000 --> 0:03:08,000
in and beyond the emotional brain.

64
0:03:08.342,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It motivates us to move toward or away from a stimulus.

65
0:03:13.339,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Wanting is more like your toddler, following you around,

66
0:03:15.999,000 --> 0:03:16,000
asking for another cookie.

67
0:03:17.57,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So wanting and liking are related.

68
0:03:20.221,000 --> 0:03:21,000
They are not identical.

69
0:03:21.974,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And the third system is learning.

70
0:03:24.173,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Learning is Pavlov's dogs.

71
0:03:25.728,000 --> 0:03:26,000
You remember Pavlov?

72
0:03:27.086,000 --> 0:03:29,000
He makes dogs salivate in response to a bell.

73
0:03:29.228,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It's easy, you give a dog food, salivates automatically,

74
0:03:31.915,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and you ring a bell.

75
0:03:33.114,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Food, salivate, bell.

76
0:03:34.298,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Food, bell, salivate.

77
0:03:35.895,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Bell, salivate.

78
0:03:38.656,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Does that salivation mean that the dog wants to eat the bell?

79
0:03:44.529,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Does it mean that the dog finds the bell delicious?

80
0:03:48.322,000 --> 0:03:49,000
No.

81
0:03:49.498,000 --> 0:03:53,000
What Pavlov did was make the bell food-related.

82
0:03:54.522,000 --> 0:03:57,000
When we see this separateness of wanting, liking and learning,

83
0:03:58.03,000 --> 0:04:,000
this is where we find an explanatory framework

84
0:04:00.689,000 --> 0:04:03,000
for understanding what researchers call arousal nonconcordance.

85
0:04:04.681,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Nonconcordance, very simply,

86
0:04:06.268,000 --> 0:04:08,000
is when there is a lack of predictive relationship

87
0:04:08.934,000 --> 0:04:1,000
between your physiological response, like salivation,

88
0:04:11.919,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and your subjective experience of pleasure and desire.

89
0:04:16.379,000 --> 0:04:2,000
That happens in every emotional and motivational system that we have,

90
0:04:20.744,000 --> 0:04:21,000
including sex.

91
0:04:22.378,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Research over the last 30 years

92
0:04:23.888,000 --> 0:04:25,000
has found that genital blood flow can increase

93
0:04:26.628,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in response to sex-related stimuli

94
0:04:29.474,000 --> 0:04:32,000
even if those sex-related stimuli are not also associated

95
0:04:32.529,000 --> 0:04:35,000
with the subjective experience of wanting and liking.

96
0:04:35.673,000 --> 0:04:37,000
In fact, the predictive relationship

97
0:04:37.792,000 --> 0:04:39,000
between genital response and subjective experience

98
0:04:40.173,000 --> 0:04:43,000
is between 10 and 50 percent.

99
0:04:43.767,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Which is an enormous range.

100
0:04:46.753,000 --> 0:04:49,000
You just can't predict necessarily

101
0:04:50.183,000 --> 0:04:53,000
how a person feels about that sex-related stimulus

102
0:04:53.243,000 --> 0:04:55,000
just by looking at their genital blood flow.

103
0:04:55.839,000 --> 0:04:58,000
When I explained this to my husband, he gave me the best possible example.

104
0:04:59.362,000 --> 0:05:,000
He was like,

105
0:05:00.568,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"So, that could explain this one time, when I was in high school, I ...

106
0:05:04.633,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I got an erection in response to the phrase 'doughnut hole.'"

107
0:05:07.688,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:09.204,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Did he want to have sex with the doughnut?

109
0:05:11.744,000 --> 0:05:12,000
No.

110
0:05:12.926,000 --> 0:05:14,000
He was a teenage boy flooded with testosterone,

111
0:05:15.919,000 --> 0:05:17,000
which makes everything a little bit sex-related.

112
0:05:18.752,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And it can go in both directions.

113
0:05:20.363,000 --> 0:05:23,000
A person with a penis may struggle to get an erection one evening,

114
0:05:24.006,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and then wake up the very next morning with an erection,

115
0:05:26.665,000 --> 0:05:28,000
when it's nothing but a hassle.

116
0:05:29.284,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I got a phone call from a 30-something friend, a woman,

117
0:05:31.911,000 --> 0:05:34,000
she said, "So, my partner and I were in the middle of doing some things

118
0:05:35.349,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and I was like, 'I want you right now.'

119
0:05:37.271,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And he said, 'No, you're still dry, you're just being nice.'

120
0:05:42.108,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And I was so ready.

121
0:05:43.633,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So what's the matter, is it hormonal, should I talk to a doctor,

122
0:05:46.673,000 --> 0:05:47,000
what's going on?"

123
0:05:47.877,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Answer?

124
0:05:49.076,000 --> 0:05:5,000
It's arousal nonconcordance.

125
0:05:50.537,000 --> 0:05:53,000
If you're experiencing unwanted pain, talk to a medical provider.

126
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Otherwise -- arousal nonconcordance.

127
0:05:56.331,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Your genital behavior just doesn't necessarily predict

128
0:05:59.339,000 --> 0:06:02,000
your subjective experience of liking and wanting.

129
0:06:02.614,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Another friend, back in college,

130
0:06:04.162,000 --> 0:06:07,000
told me about her first experiences of power play in a sexual relationship.

131
0:06:07.726,000 --> 0:06:08,000
She told me that her partner tied her up

132
0:06:09.686,000 --> 0:06:12,000
with her arms over her head like this, she's standing up and he positions her

133
0:06:13.355,000 --> 0:06:16,000
so she's straddling a bar, presses up against her clitoris, like this.

134
0:06:16.784,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So there's my friend, standing there, and the guy leaves.

135
0:06:19.514,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It's a power play.

136
0:06:20.744,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Leaves her alone.

137
0:06:21.919,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So there's my friend, and she goes,

138
0:06:24.236,000 --> 0:06:25,000
"I'm bored."

139
0:06:25.458,000 --> 0:06:26,000
(Laughter)

140
0:06:26.697,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And the guy comes back and she says, "I am bored."

141
0:06:30.569,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And he looks at her and he looks at the bar

142
0:06:32.61,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and he says, "Then why are you wet?"

143
0:06:36.129,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Why was she wet?

144
0:06:38.7,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Is it sex-related to have pressure directly against your clitoris?

145
0:06:42.455,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Yeah.

146
0:06:43.637,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Does that tell him whether she wants or likes what's happening?

147
0:06:47.835,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Nope.

148
0:06:49.192,000 --> 0:06:52,000
What does tell him whether she wants or likes what's happening?

149
0:06:54.216,000 --> 0:06:55,000
She does!

150
0:06:55.399,000 --> 0:06:58,000
She recognized and articulated what she wanted and liked.

151
0:06:59.471,000 --> 0:07:01,000
All he had to do was listen to her words.

152
0:07:02.447,000 --> 0:07:05,000
My friend on the phone -- what's the solution?

153
0:07:05.828,000 --> 0:07:08,000
You tell your partner, "Listen to your words."

154
0:07:09.498,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Also, buy some lube.

155
0:07:11.561,000 --> 0:07:12,000
(Laughter)

156
0:07:13.514,000 --> 0:07:14,000
(Applause)

157
0:07:14.974,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Applause for lube, absolutely.

158
0:07:16.869,000 --> 0:07:17,000
(Applause)

159
0:07:18.323,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Everyone, everywhere.

160
0:07:20.855,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But I want to tell you a darker listen-to-her-words story.

161
0:07:23.927,000 --> 0:07:25,000
This one comes from a note that a student sent me

162
0:07:26.474,000 --> 0:07:28,000
after I gave a lecture about arousal nonconcordance.

163
0:07:28.998,000 --> 0:07:31,000
She was with a partner, a new partner, glad to be doing things,

164
0:07:32.427,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and they reached a point

165
0:07:33.602,000 --> 0:07:35,000
where that was as far as she was interested in going

166
0:07:36.072,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and so she said no.

167
0:07:37.247,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And the partner said, "No, you're wet, you're so ready, don't be shy."

168
0:07:42.434,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Shy?

169
0:07:43.927,000 --> 0:07:46,000
As if it hadn't taken all the courage and confidence she had

170
0:07:47.419,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to say no to someone she liked.

171
0:07:49.926,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Whose feelings she did not want to hurt.

172
0:07:52.942,000 --> 0:07:53,000
But she said it again.

173
0:07:55.355,000 --> 0:07:56,000
She said no.

174
0:07:57.728,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Did he listen to her words?

175
0:08:01.768,000 --> 0:08:05,000
In the age of Me Too and Time's Up, people ask me,

176
0:08:05.879,000 --> 0:08:07,000
"How do I even know what my partner wants and likes?

177
0:08:08.355,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Is all consent to be verbal and contractual now?"

178
0:08:10.847,000 --> 0:08:11,000
There are times when consent is ambiguous

179
0:08:12.865,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and we need a large-scale cultural conversation about that.

180
0:08:17.001,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But can we make sure we're noticing how clear consent is

181
0:08:21.014,000 --> 0:08:23,000
if we eliminate this myth?

182
0:08:23.125,000 --> 0:08:25,000
In every example I've described so far,

183
0:08:25.339,000 --> 0:08:28,000
one partner recognized and articulated what they wanted and liked:

184
0:08:29.196,000 --> 0:08:3,000
"I want you right now."

185
0:08:31.03,000 --> 0:08:32,000
"No."

186
0:08:32.657,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And their partner told them they were wrong.

187
0:08:35.612,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It's gaslighting.

188
0:08:37.041,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Profound and degrading.

189
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
You say you feel one way,

190
0:08:40.403,000 --> 0:08:43,000
but your body proves that you feel something else.

191
0:08:43.625,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And we only do this around sexuality,

192
0:08:46.22,000 --> 0:08:47,000
because arousal nonconcordance

193
0:08:47.72,000 --> 0:08:49,000
happens with every emotional and motivational system we have.

194
0:08:50.61,000 --> 0:08:54,000
If my mouth waters when I bite into a wormy apple,

195
0:08:54.919,000 --> 0:08:55,000
does anybody say to me,

196
0:08:56.673,000 --> 0:08:58,000
"You said no, but your body said yes?"

197
0:08:59.284,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Laughter)

198
0:09:00.99,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And it's not only our partners who get it wrong.

199
0:09:03.823,000 --> 0:09:05,000
The National Judicial Education Program published a document

200
0:09:06.7,000 --> 0:09:1,000
called "Judges Tell: What I Wish I Had Known Before I Presided

201
0:09:11.196,000 --> 0:09:13,000
in a Case of an Adult Victim of Sexual Assault."

202
0:09:14.434,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Number 13:

203
0:09:15.744,000 --> 0:09:19,000
On occasion, the victim, female or male, may experience a physical response,

204
0:09:20.077,000 --> 0:09:24,000
but this is not a sexual response in the sense of desire or mutuality."

205
0:09:24.315,000 --> 0:09:26,000
This brings me one step closer into the darkness,

206
0:09:26.649,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and then I promise we will find our way into the light.

207
0:09:29.276,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I'm thinking of a recent court case involving multiple instances

208
0:09:32.308,000 --> 0:09:33,000
of non-consensual sexual contact.

209
0:09:34.149,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Imagine you're on the jury

210
0:09:35.895,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and you learn that the victim had orgasms.

211
0:09:39.403,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Does it change how your gut responds to the case?

212
0:09:42.735,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Let me remind you, orgasm is physiological;

213
0:09:44.775,000 --> 0:09:46,000
it is a spontaneous, involuntary release of tension,

214
0:09:47.243,000 --> 0:09:49,000
generated in response to sex-related stimuli.

215
0:09:51.434,000 --> 0:09:55,000
But the perpetrator’s lawyer made sure the jury knew about those orgasms

216
0:09:55.553,000 --> 0:09:58,000
because he thought the orgasms could be construed as consent.

217
0:10:00.674,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I will also add that this was a child being abused by an adult in the family.

218
0:10:04.674,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I invite you to breathe.

219
0:10:06.682,000 --> 0:10:08,000
That kind of story can give a person all kind of feelings,

220
0:10:09.483,000 --> 0:10:12,000
from rage to shame to confused arousal

221
0:10:13.086,000 --> 0:10:14,000
because it is sex-related,

222
0:10:15.014,000 --> 0:10:17,000
even though it is appalling.

223
0:10:19.069,000 --> 0:10:21,000
But even though I know it's difficult

224
0:10:21.784,000 --> 0:10:23,000
to sit with those feelings in a room full of strangers,

225
0:10:24.395,000 --> 0:10:27,000
if we can find our way through all of the messy feelings,

226
0:10:27.688,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I believe we will find our way to the light of compassion

227
0:10:32.244,000 --> 0:10:34,000
for that child,

228
0:10:34.268,000 --> 0:10:36,000
whose relationship with her body was damaged

229
0:10:36.856,000 --> 0:10:38,000
by an adult whose job it was to protect it.

230
0:10:40.561,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And we'll find hope that there was a trustworthy adult

231
0:10:44.68,000 --> 0:10:45,000
who could say, "Genital response

232
0:10:46.434,000 --> 0:10:49,000
just means it was a sex-related stimulus; doesn't mean it was wanted or liked,

233
0:10:50.157,000 --> 0:10:52,000
certainly doesn't mean it was consented to.

234
0:10:53.124,000 --> 0:10:58,000
(Applause)

235
0:10:58.278,000 --> 0:11:02,000
That compassion and that hope are why I travel all over,

236
0:11:03.3,000 --> 0:11:05,000
talking about this to anyone who will listen.

237
0:11:05.434,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I can see it helping people, even as I say the words.

238
0:11:11.354,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I invite you to say the words.

239
0:11:15.544,000 --> 0:11:17,000
You don't have to say "clitoris" in front of 1000 strangers.

240
0:11:18.783,000 --> 0:11:21,000
But do have one brave conversation.

241
0:11:22.306,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Tell this to someone you know who has experienced sexual violence --

242
0:11:25.521,000 --> 0:11:26,000
you definitely know someone.

243
0:11:26.879,000 --> 0:11:28,000
In the US it's one in three women.

244
0:11:29.077,000 --> 0:11:3,000
One in six men.

245
0:11:30.99,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Almost half of transgender folks.

246
0:11:33.68,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Say "Genital response means it's a sex-related stimulus.

247
0:11:37.046,000 --> 0:11:38,000
It doesn't mean it was wanted or liked."

248
0:11:39.53,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Say it to a judge you know or a lawyer you know,

249
0:11:42.333,000 --> 0:11:45,000
or a cop or anyone who might sit on a jury in a sexual assault case.

250
0:11:46.256,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Say "Some people think that your body doesn't respond

251
0:11:48.868,000 --> 0:11:5,000
if you don't want or like what's happening,

252
0:11:51.506,000 --> 0:11:52,000
if only that were true.

253
0:11:52.927,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Instead, arousal nonconcordance.

254
0:11:55.585,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Say this to the confused teenager in your life

255
0:11:58.887,000 --> 0:12:02,000
who is just trying to figure out what, even, what?

256
0:12:03.244,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Say, if you bite this moldy fruit and your mouth waters,

257
0:12:08.895,000 --> 0:12:09,000
nobody would say to you,

258
0:12:10.292,000 --> 0:12:13,000
"Well, you just don't want to admit how much you like it."

259
0:12:13.561,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Same goes for down below, arousal nonconcordance.

260
0:12:17.387,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Say it to your partner.

261
0:12:19.244,000 --> 0:12:21,000
My genitals do not tell you what I want or like.

262
0:12:22.823,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I do.

263
0:12:24.813,000 --> 0:12:29,000
(Applause)

264
0:12:30.271,000 --> 0:12:31,000
The roots of this myth are deep

265
0:12:31.787,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and they are entangled with some very dark forces in our culture.

266
0:12:35.088,000 --> 0:12:38,000
But with every brave conversation we have,

267
0:12:38.657,000 --> 0:12:4,000
we make the world that little bit better, a little simpler

268
0:12:41.419,000 --> 0:12:42,000
for the confused teenager.

269
0:12:43.458,000 --> 0:12:46,000
A little easier for your friend on the phone, worried that she's broken.

270
0:12:48.363,000 --> 0:12:5,000
A little easier and safer

271
0:12:51.259,000 --> 0:12:53,000
for the survivors, one in three women.

272
0:12:53.926,000 --> 0:12:54,000
One in six men.

273
0:12:55.648,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Half of trans folks.

274
0:12:58.633,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Me too.

275
0:13:00.514,000 --> 0:13:02,000
So for every brave conversation you have,

276
0:13:04.601,000 --> 0:13:05,000
thank you.

277
0:13:05.776,000 --> 0:13:11,000
(Applause)

278
0:13:13.268,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Thank you.

279
0:13:15.379,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Thanks.

280
0:13:16.585,000 --> 0:13:19,000
(Applause)

281
0:13:20.232,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Helen Walters: Emily, come up here.

282
0:13:22.089,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Thank you so much.

283
0:13:23.645,000 --> 0:13:24,000
I know that you do this all the time,

284
0:13:25.497,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and yet, still, I'm so grateful to you for having the courage

285
0:13:28.847,000 --> 0:13:3,000
to come and talk about that on this stage.

286
0:13:30.887,000 --> 0:13:32,000
It really took a lot and we're very grateful to you.

287
0:13:33.355,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So thank you.

288
0:13:34.557,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Emily Nagoski: I am grateful to be here.

289
0:13:36.498,000 --> 0:13:37,000
HW: So in your regular day job,

290
0:13:38.125,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I imagine, as you put at the top of the talk,

291
0:13:40.245,000 --> 0:13:41,000
you get asked a lot of questions.

292
0:13:41.863,000 --> 0:13:44,000
But what's the one question that you get asked all the time

293
0:13:45.498,000 --> 0:13:49,000
that you can share with everyone here so you don't have to answer it 1000 times

294
0:13:50.03,000 --> 0:13:51,000
throughout the rest of the week?

295
0:13:51.895,000 --> 0:13:52,000
EN: The question I get asked most often

296
0:13:53.815,000 --> 0:13:56,000
is actually the question underneath pretty much all the other questions,

297
0:13:57.244,000 --> 0:13:59,000
so, can you get addicted to your vibrator,

298
0:13:59.307,000 --> 0:14:01,000
please help me with my erectile dysfunction?

299
0:14:01.411,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Underneath every question is actually the question, "Am I normal?"

300
0:14:04.839,000 --> 0:14:06,000
To which my answer in my mind is,

301
0:14:07.244,000 --> 0:14:11,000
what even is normal and why is that what you want your sexuality to be?

302
0:14:11.942,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Why do we only want to be normal around sexuality?

303
0:14:14.307,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Don't we want to be extraordinary?

304
0:14:16.18,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Like, do you just want normal sex or do you want awesome sex in your life?

305
0:14:20.014,000 --> 0:14:22,000
I think, though, there's a lot of fear

306
0:14:22.498,000 --> 0:14:24,000
around being too different sexually.

307
0:14:24.689,000 --> 0:14:25,000
When people are asking me,

308
0:14:26.252,000 --> 0:14:27,000
"Is this thing I'm experiencing normal,"

309
0:14:28.197,000 --> 0:14:31,000
what they're actually asking me is, "Do I belong?"

310
0:14:31.998,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Do I belong in this relationship,

311
0:14:33.943,000 --> 0:14:35,000
do I belong in this community of people,

312
0:14:36.442,000 --> 0:14:38,000
do I belong on earth as a sexual person?

313
0:14:39.178,000 --> 0:14:42,000
To which the answer is always a resounding yes.

314
0:14:43.164,000 --> 0:14:47,000
The only barrier there is, the only limit there is, there are two:

315
0:14:47.211,000 --> 0:14:5,000
one, if you're experiencing unwanted sexual pain,

316
0:14:50.37,000 --> 0:14:51,000
talk to a medical provider.

317
0:14:51.696,000 --> 0:14:55,000
And two: As along as everybody involved is free and glad to be there,

318
0:14:56.069,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and free to leave whenever they want to,

319
0:14:58.015,000 --> 0:15:,000
you're allowed to do anything that you want to.

320
0:15:00.728,000 --> 0:15:02,000
There is no script, there is no box you have to fit into,

321
0:15:03.577,000 --> 0:15:06,000
you're allowed, as long as there is consent and no unwanted pain,

322
0:15:07.151,000 --> 0:15:09,000
you're totally free to do whatever you want.

323
0:15:09.785,000 --> 0:15:1,000
HW: Amazing. Thank you so much.

324
0:15:11.402,000 --> 0:15:12,000
EN: Thank you.

325
0:15:12.598,000 --> 0:15:13,000
HW: Thank you, you're incredible.

326
0:15:14.286,000 --> 0:15:15,000

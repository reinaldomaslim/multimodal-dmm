1
0:00:12.92,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I come from Egypt,

2
0:00:15.44,000 --> 0:00:18,000
which is also called Umm al-Dunya, the Mother of the World.

3
0:00:20.84,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It's a rich country filled with stories of rebellion,

4
0:00:23.72,000 --> 0:00:26,000
stories of civilizational triumph and downfall

5
0:00:27.12,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and the rich, religious,

6
0:00:28.76,000 --> 0:00:31,000
ethnic, cultural and linguistic diversity.

7
0:00:33.36,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Growing up in such an environment,

8
0:00:35.56,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I became a strong believer in the power of storytelling.

9
0:00:39.68,000 --> 0:00:42,000
As I searched for the medium with which to tell my story,

10
0:00:42.72,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I stumbled upon graphic design.

11
0:00:45.64,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I would like to share with you a project

12
0:00:47.68,000 --> 0:00:5,000
of how graphic design can bring the Arabic language to life.

13
0:00:51.36,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But first, let me tell you why I want to do this.

14
0:00:54.64,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I believe that graphic design can change the world.

15
0:00:58.12,000 --> 0:00:59,000
At least in my very own city of Cairo,

16
0:01:00.12,000 --> 0:01:02,000
it helped overthrow two separate dictators.

17
0:01:03.84,000 --> 0:01:05,000
As you can see from those photos,

18
0:01:05.96,000 --> 0:01:09,000
the power and potential of graphic design as a tool for positive change

19
0:01:10.36,000 --> 0:01:11,000
is undeniably strong.

20
0:01:13.44,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Egypt's 2011 revolution was also a grassroots design revolution.

21
0:01:18.6,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Everyone became a creator.

22
0:01:20.92,000 --> 0:01:22,000
People were the real designers

23
0:01:23.2,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and, just overnight,

24
0:01:24.72,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Cairo was flooded with posters,

25
0:01:27.32,000 --> 0:01:29,000
signage, graffiti.

26
0:01:30.08,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Visual communication

27
0:01:31.88,000 --> 0:01:34,000
was the medium that spoke far louder than words

28
0:01:35.08,000 --> 0:01:39,000
when the population of over 90 million voices were suppressed

29
0:01:39.32,000 --> 0:01:4,000
for almost 30 years.

30
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It was precisely this political and social suppression,

31
0:01:46.52,000 --> 0:01:49,000
coupled with decades of colonialism

32
0:01:49.56,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and miseducation

33
0:01:51.36,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that slowly eroded the significance of the Arabic script in the region.

34
0:01:55.24,000 --> 0:01:57,000
All of these countries once used Arabic.

35
0:01:57.84,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Now it's just the green and the blue.

36
0:02:00.96,000 --> 0:02:01,000
To put it simply,

37
0:02:02.68,000 --> 0:02:03,000
the Arabic script is dying.

38
0:02:05.12,000 --> 0:02:09,000
In postcolonial Arab countries functioning in an increasingly globalized world,

39
0:02:09.76,000 --> 0:02:1,000
it is a growing alarm

40
0:02:11.32,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that less and less people are using the Arabic script to communicate.

41
0:02:17.72,000 --> 0:02:21,000
As I was studying my master's in Italy, I noticed myself missing Arabic.

42
0:02:22.4,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I missed looking at the letters,

43
0:02:24.36,000 --> 0:02:25,000
digesting their meaning.

44
0:02:26.2,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So one day, I walked into one of the biggest libraries in Italy

45
0:02:30.56,000 --> 0:02:31,000
in search of an Arabic book.

46
0:02:32.88,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I was surprised to find that this is what they had

47
0:02:35.56,000 --> 0:02:38,000
under the category of "Arabic/Middle Eastern books."

48
0:02:41.08,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:43.52,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Fear, terrorism and destruction.

50
0:02:48.24,000 --> 0:02:49,000
One word: ISIS.

51
0:02:51.04,000 --> 0:02:52,000
My heart ached

52
0:02:52.68,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that this is how we are portrayed to the world,

53
0:02:54.92,000 --> 0:02:56,000
even from a literary perspective.

54
0:02:57.56,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I asked myself: Whatever happened to the world-renowned writers

55
0:03:02.04,000 --> 0:03:05,000
like Naguib Mahfouz, Khalil Gibran,

56
0:03:06.28,000 --> 0:03:1,000
iconic poets like Mutanabbi, Nizar Qabbani?

57
0:03:11.88,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Think about this.

58
0:03:13.64,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The cultural products of an entire region of the world,

59
0:03:17.68,000 --> 0:03:19,000
as rich, as diverse,

60
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:21,000
have been deemed redundant,

61
0:03:22.56,000 --> 0:03:23,000
if not ignored altogether.

62
0:03:25.88,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The cultural products of an entire region of the world

63
0:03:29.6,000 --> 0:03:32,000
have been barred from imparting any kind of real impact

64
0:03:33.4,000 --> 0:03:36,000
on global media productions and contemporary social discourse.

65
0:03:37.44,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And then I reminded myself of my number one belief:

66
0:03:39.96,000 --> 0:03:41,000
design can change the world.

67
0:03:42.28,000 --> 0:03:44,000
All you need is for someone to catch a glimpse of your work,

68
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
feel, connect.

69
0:03:47.44,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And so I started.

70
0:03:49.6,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I thought about how can I stop the world from seeing us as evil,

71
0:03:53.8,000 --> 0:03:55,000
as terrorists of this planet,

72
0:03:55.96,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and start perceiving us as equals,

73
0:03:59.12,000 --> 0:04:,000
fellow humans?

74
0:04:01.48,000 --> 0:04:03,000
How can I save and honor the Arabic script

75
0:04:03.84,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and share it with other people, other cultures?

76
0:04:07.4,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And then it hit me:

77
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
What if I combined the two most significant symbols

78
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
of innocence and Arab identity?

79
0:04:16.24,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Maybe then people could resonate.

80
0:04:19.12,000 --> 0:04:22,000
What's more pure, innocent and fun as LEGO?

81
0:04:22.68,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It's a universal child's toy.

82
0:04:24.28,000 --> 0:04:27,000
You play with them, you build with them,

83
0:04:27.6,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and with them, you imagine endless possibilities.

84
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
My eureka moment was to find a bilingual solution for Arabic education,

85
0:04:35.64,000 --> 0:04:37,000
because effective communication and education

86
0:04:38.32,000 --> 0:04:4,000
is the road to more tolerant communities.

87
0:04:41.12,000 --> 0:04:45,000
However, the Arabic and Latin scripts do not only represent different worlds

88
0:04:45.44,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but also create technical difficulties for both Eastern and Western communities

89
0:04:50.04,000 --> 0:04:51,000
on a daily basis.

90
0:04:51.56,000 --> 0:04:53,000
There are so many reasons why Arabic and Latin are different,

91
0:04:54.48,000 --> 0:04:55,000
but here are some of the main ones.

92
0:04:56.2,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Yes, both use upward and downward strokes,

93
0:04:58.92,000 --> 0:05:,000
but have completely different baselines.

94
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Arabic tends to be more calligraphic

95
0:05:04.44,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and connectivity is important to the Arabic language,

96
0:05:07.4,000 --> 0:05:11,000
whose letters have to be mostly joined in order to articulate a given word.

97
0:05:11.76,000 --> 0:05:15,000
It also uses an entirely different system of punctuation and diacritics.

98
0:05:16.36,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But most importantly,

99
0:05:18.44,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Arabic has no capital letters.

100
0:05:20.6,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Instead it has four different letter forms:

101
0:05:23.96,000 --> 0:05:26,000
initial, medial, isolated and final.

102
0:05:28.52,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I want to introduce the Arabic language to young learners, foreign speakers,

103
0:05:33.4,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but most importantly help refugees integrate to their host societies

104
0:05:39.44,000 --> 0:05:41,000
through creating a bilingual learning system,

105
0:05:41.92,000 --> 0:05:43,000
a two-way flow of communication.

106
0:05:44.56,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And I called it "Let's Play."

107
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The idea is to simply create a fun and engaging way of learning

108
0:05:52.84,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Modern Standard Arabic through LEGO.

109
0:05:55.84,000 --> 0:05:57,000
These are the two words. "Let's Play."

110
0:05:58.52,000 --> 0:06:,000
Every colored bar marks an Arabic letter.

111
0:06:02.08,000 --> 0:06:06,000
As you can see, the letter is explained in form, sound

112
0:06:06.4,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and examples of words in function,

113
0:06:08.84,000 --> 0:06:1,000
in addition to the equivalent in Latin.

114
0:06:11.48,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Together, they form a fun pocket book

115
0:06:13.76,000 --> 0:06:16,000
with the 29 Arabic letters and the four different forms,

116
0:06:17.24,000 --> 0:06:18,000
plus a 400-word dictionary.

117
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So this is how the page looks like.

118
0:06:21.96,000 --> 0:06:23,000
You have the letter, the transliteration in Latin

119
0:06:24.44,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and the description underneath.

120
0:06:27.2,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I'll take you through the process.

121
0:06:29.52,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So first in my tiny studio in Florence,

122
0:06:31.68,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I built the letters.

123
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I photographed each letter separately,

124
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and then I retouched every letter and chose the correct color background

125
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and typefaces to use.

126
0:06:42.32,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Ultimately, I created the full letter set,

127
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
which is 29 letters times four different forms.

128
0:06:48.68,000 --> 0:06:51,000
That's 116 letters build just in one week.

129
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I believe that information should and can be fun, portable.

130
0:06:58.04,000 --> 0:07:,000
This book is the final product,

131
0:07:00.64,000 --> 0:07:02,000
which I would eventually like to publish

132
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and translate into as many languages in the world,

133
0:07:06.44,000 --> 0:07:12,000
so that Arabic teaching and learning becomes fun, easy and accessible globally.

134
0:07:13.52,000 --> 0:07:17,000
With this book, I hope to save my nation's beautiful script.

135
0:07:18.48,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Applause)

136
0:07:22.96,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Thank you.

137
0:07:27.12,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Working on this project was a form of visual meditation,

138
0:07:32.04,000 --> 0:07:33,000
like a Sufi dance,

139
0:07:33.32,000 --> 0:07:34,000
a prayer to a better planet.

140
0:07:35.92,000 --> 0:07:38,000
One set of building blocks made two languages.

141
0:07:39.56,000 --> 0:07:4,000
LEGO is just a metaphor.

142
0:07:41.96,000 --> 0:07:44,000
It's because we are all made of the same building unit,

143
0:07:45.24,000 --> 0:07:46,000
is that I can see a future

144
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
where the barriers between people

145
0:07:49.96,000 --> 0:07:5,000
all come tumbling down.

146
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So no matter how ugly the world around us gets,

147
0:07:55.48,000 --> 0:07:58,000
or how many discouraging books on ISIS, the terrorist group,

148
0:07:59.12,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and not Isis, the ancient Egyptian goddess,

149
0:08:02.32,000 --> 0:08:03,000
continue to be published,

150
0:08:04.32,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I will keep building one colorful world.

151
0:08:08.12,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Shukran, which means "thank you."

152
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Applause)

153
0:08:12.8,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Thank you. Thank you so much.

154
0:08:15.44,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Thank you.

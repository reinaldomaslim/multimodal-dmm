1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So the first question is, why do we need to

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
even worry about a pandemic threat?

3
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
What is it that we're concerned about?

4
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
When I say "we," I'm at the Council on Foreign Relations.

5
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We're concerned in the national security community,

6
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and of course in the biology community and the public health community.

7
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
While globalization has increased travel,

8
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
it's made it necessary that everybody be everywhere,

9
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
all the time, all over the world.

10
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And that means that your microbial hitchhikers are moving with you.

11
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So a plague outbreak in Surat, India

12
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
becomes not an obscure event, but a globalized event --

13
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
a globalized concern that has changed the risk equation.

14
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Katrina showed us

15
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that we cannot completely depend on government

16
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to have readiness in hand, to be capable of handling things.

17
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Indeed, an outbreak would be multiple Katrinas at once.

18
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Our big concern at the moment is a virus called H5N1 flu --

19
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
some of you call it bird flu --

20
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
which first emerged in southern China, in the mid-1990s,

21
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
but we didn't know about it until 1997.

22
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
At the end of last Christmas only 13 countries had seen H5N1.

23
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But we're now up to 55 countries in the world,

24
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
have had this virus emerge,

25
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
in either birds, or people or both.

26
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
In the bird outbreaks we now can see

27
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that pretty much the whole world has seen this virus

28
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
except the Americas.

29
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And I'll get into why we've so far been spared in a moment.

30
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
In domestic birds, especially chickens,

31
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
it's 100 percent lethal.

32
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It's one of the most lethal things we've seen

33
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in circulation in the world

34
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
in any recent centuries.

35
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And we've dealt with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens,

36
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmers

37
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
with the result that there's cover-up.

38
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It's also carried on migration patterns

39
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
of wild migratory aquatic birds.

40
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
There has been this centralized event

41
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
in a place called Lake Chenghai, China.

42
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Two years ago the migrating birds

43
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
had a multiple event

44
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
where thousands died because of a mutation occurring

45
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
in the virus,

46
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
which made the species range broaden dramatically.

47
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So that birds going to Siberia, to Europe, and to Africa

48
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
carried the virus, which had not previously been possible.

49
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
We're now seeing outbreaks in human populations --

50
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
so far, fortunately, small events,

51
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
tiny outbreaks, occasional clusters.

52
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
The virus has mutated dramatically in the last two years

53
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to form two distinct families, if you will,

54
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
of the H5N1 viral tree

55
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
with branches in them,

56
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and with different attributes that are worrying.

57
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So what's concerning us? Well, first of all,

58
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
at no time in history have we succeeded in making

59
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
in a timely fashion, a specific vaccine

60
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
for more than 260 million people.

61
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It's not going to do us very much good in a global pandemic.

62
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
You've heard about the vaccine we're stockpiling.

63
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But nobody believes it will actually be particularly effective

64
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
if we have a real outbreak.

65
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So one thought is:

66
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
after 9/11, when the airports closed,

67
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
our flu season was delayed by two weeks.

68
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So the thought is, hey, maybe what we should do is just

69
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
immediately -- we hear there is H5N1 spreading from human to human,

70
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
the virus has mutated to be a human-to-human transmitter --

71
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
let's shut down the airports.

72
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
However, huge supercomputer analyses,

73
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
done of the likely effectiveness of this,

74
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
show that it won't buy us much time at all.

75
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans.

76
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
For example, all masks are made in China.

77
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
How do you get them mobilized around the world

78
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
if you've shut all the airports down?

79
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
How do you get the vaccines moved around the world

80
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and the drugs moved, and whatever may or not be available that would work.

81
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive.

82
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
We're worried because this virus, unlike any other flu

83
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
we've ever studied, can be transmitted by eating raw meat

84
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
of the infected animals.

85
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We've seen transmission to wild cats and domestic cats,

86
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and now also domestic pet dogs.

87
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets,

88
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu:

89
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
seizures, central nervous system disorders, partial paralysis.

90
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
This is not your normal garden-variety flu.

91
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It mimics what we now understand

92
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
about reconstructing the 1918 flu virus,

93
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the last great pandemic,

94
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
in that it also jumped directly from birds to people.

95
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
We had evolution over time,

96
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings:

97
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
55 percent of people who have become infected

98
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
with H5N1 have, in fact, succumbed.

99
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And we don't have a huge number of people

100
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
who got infected and never developed disease.

101
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
In experimental feeding in monkeys

102
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
you can see that it actually downregulates

103
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
a specific immune system modulator.

104
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
The result is that what kills you

105
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
is not the virus directly, but your own immune system overreacting, saying,

106
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"Whatever this is so foreign I'm going berserk."

107
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The result: most of the deaths

108
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
have been in people under 30 years of age,

109
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
robustly healthy young adults.

110
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
We have seen human-to-human transmission

111
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
in at least three clusters --

112
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
fortunately involving very intimate contact,

113
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
still not putting the world at large at any kind of risk.

114
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Alright, so I've got you nervous.

115
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Now you probably assume, well the governments are going to do something.

116
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And we have spent a lot of money.

117
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Most of the spending in the Bush administration

118
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
has actually been more related to the anthrax results

119
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and bio-terrorism threat.

120
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But a lot of money has been thrown out at the local level and at the federal level

121
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
to look at infectious diseases.

122
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
End result: only 15 states

123
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
have been certified to be able to do mass distribution

124
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
of vaccine and drugs in a pandemic.

125
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Half the states would run out of hospital beds

126
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
in the first week, maybe two weeks.

127
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And 40 states already have an acute nursing shortage.

128
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Add on pandemic threat, you're in big trouble.

129
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So what have people been doing with this money?

130
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Exercises, drills, all over the world.

131
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Let's pretend there's a pandemic.

132
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Let's everybody run around and play your role.

133
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Main result is that there is tremendous confusion.

134
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Most of these people don't actually know what their job will be.

135
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And the bottom line, major thing that has come through

136
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
in every single drill: nobody knows who's in charge.

137
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
Nobody knows the chain of command.

138
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
If it were Los Angeles, is it the mayor, the governor,

139
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
the President of the United States, the head of Homeland Security?

140
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
In fact, the federal government says it's a guy called

141
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
the Principle Federal Officer,

142
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
who happens to be with TSA.

143
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The government says

144
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
the federal responsibility will basically be

145
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
about trying to keep the virus out, which we all know is impossible,

146
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and then to mitigate the impact

147
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
primarily on our economy.

148
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
The rest is up to your local community.

149
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Everything is about your town, where you live.

150
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Well how good a city council you have,

151
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
how good a mayor you have -- that's who's going to be in charge.

152
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Most local facilities would all be competing

153
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to try and get their hands on their piece

154
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
of the federal stockpile of a drug called Tamiflu,

155
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
which may or may not be helpful -- I'll get into that --

156
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
of available vaccines, and any other treatments,

157
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and masks, and anything that's been stockpiled.

158
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And you'll have massive competition.

159
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Now we did purchase a vaccine, you've probably all heard about it,

160
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
made by Sanofi-Aventis.

161
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Unfortunately it's made against the current form of H5N1.

162
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We know the virus will mutate. It will be a different virus.

163
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The vaccine will probably be useless.

164
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So here's where the decisions come in.

165
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
You're the mayor of your local town.

166
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Let's see, should we order that all pets be kept indoors?

167
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Germany did that when H5N1 appeared in Germany last year,

168
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
in order to minimize the spread

169
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
between households by household cats, dogs and so on.

170
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
What do we do when we don't have any containment rooms

171
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
with reverse air that will allow the healthcare workers

172
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to take care of patients?

173
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
These are in Hong Kong; we have nothing like that here.

174
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
What about quarantine?

175
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
During the SARS epidemic in Beijing quarantine did seem to help.

176
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
We have no uniform policies

177
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
regarding quarantine across the United States.

178
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And some states have differential policies, county by county.

179
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
But what about the no-brainer things? Should we close all the schools?

180
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Well then what about all the workers? They won't go to work

181
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
if their kids aren't in school.

182
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Encouraging telecommuting? What works?

183
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Well the British government did a model of telecommuting.

184
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Six weeks they had all people in the banking industry

185
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
pretend a pandemic was underway.

186
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
What they found was, the core functions --

187
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
you know you still sort of had banks,

188
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but you couldn't get people to put money in the ATM machines.

189
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Nobody was processing the credit cards.

190
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Your insurance payments didn't go through.

191
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And basically the economy would be in a disaster state of affairs.

192
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And that's just office workers, bankers.

193
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We don't know how important hand washing is for flu --

194
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
shocking. One assumes it's a good idea to wash your hands a lot.

195
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
But actually in scientific community there is great debate

196
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
about what percentage of flu transmission between people

197
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
is from sneezing and coughing

198
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and what percentage is on your hands.

199
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The Institute of Medicine tried to look at the masking question.

200
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Can we figure out a way, since we know we won't have enough masks

201
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
because we don't make them in America anymore,

202
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
they're all made in China --

203
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
do we need N95? A state-of-the-art, top-of-the-line,

204
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
must-be-fitted-to-your-face mask?

205
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Or can we get away with some different kinds of masks?

206
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
In the SARS epidemic, we learned in Hong Kong

207
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that most of transmission was because

208
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
people were removing their masks improperly.

209
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask,

210
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and then they rubbed their nose. Bingo! They got SARS.

211
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It wasn't flying microbes.

212
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
If you go online right now, you'll get so much phony-baloney information.

213
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
You'll end up buying -- this is called an N95 mask. Ridiculous.

214
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
We don't actually have a standard

215
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
for what should be the protective gear for the first responders,

216
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
the people who will actually be there on the front lines.

217
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And Tamiflu. You've probably heard of this drug,

218
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
made by Hoffmann-La Roche, patented drug.

219
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
There is some indication

220
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
that it may buy you some time in the midst of an outbreak.

221
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Should you take Tamiflu for a long period of time,

222
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
well, one of the side effects is suicidal ideations.

223
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
A public health survey analyzed the effect

224
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that large-scale Tamiflu use would have,

225
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
actually shows it counteractive

226
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
to public health measures, making matters worse.

227
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And here is the other interesting thing:

228
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
when a human being ingests Tamiflu, only 20 percent

229
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
is metabolized appropriately

230
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to be an active compound in the human being.

231
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
The rest turns into a stable compound,

232
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
which survives filtration into the water systems,

233
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
thereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry flu

234
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and providing them a chance

235
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
to breed resistant strains.

236
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And we now have seen Tamiflu-resistant strains

237
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
in both Vietnam in person-to-person transmission,

238
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and in Egypt in person-to-person transmission.

239
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So I personally think that our life expectancy

240
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
for Tamiflu as an effective drug

241
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
is very limited -- very limited indeed.

242
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Nevertheless most of the governments

243
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
have based their whole flu policies

244
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
on building stockpiles of Tamiflu.

245
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Russia has actually stockpiled enough

246
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
for 95 percent of all Russians.

247
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We've stockpiled enough for 30 percent.

248
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
When I say enough, that's two weeks worth.

249
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And then you're on your own because

250
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
the pandemic is going to last for 18 to 24 months.

251
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Some of the poorer countries

252
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that have had the most experience with H5N1 have built up stockpiles;

253
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
they're already expired. They are already out of date.

254
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
What do we know from 1918,

255
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
the last great pandemic?

256
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
The federal government abdicated most responsibility.

257
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And so we ended up with this wild patchwork of regulations

258
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
all over America.

259
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Every city, county, state did their own thing.

260
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And the rules

261
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and the belief systems were wildly disparate.

262
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
In some cases all schools, all churches,

263
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
all public venues were closed.

264
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
The pandemic circulated three times in 18 months

265
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
in the absence of commercial air travel.

266
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
The second wave was the mutated, super-killer wave.

267
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And in the first wave we had enough healthcare workers.

268
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
But by the time the second wave hit

269
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
it took such a toll among the healthcare workers

270
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that we lost most of our doctors and nurses that were on the front lines.

271
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Overall we lost 700,000 people.

272
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
The virus was 100 percent lethal to pregnant women

273
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and we don't actually know why.

274
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Most of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-olds --

275
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
robustly healthy young adults.

276
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It was likened to the plague.

277
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
We don't actually know how many people died.

278
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
The low-ball estimate is 35 million.

279
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
This was based on European and North American data.

280
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
A new study by Chris Murray at Harvard

281
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
shows that if you look at the databases that were kept

282
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
by the Brits in India,

283
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
there was a 31-fold greater death rate among the Indians.

284
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So there is a strong belief that in places of poverty

285
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
the death toll was far higher.

286
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And that a more likely toll

287
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
is somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 million people

288
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
before we had commercial air travel.

289
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
So are we ready?

290
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
As a nation, no we're not.

291
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And I think even those in the leadership

292
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
would say that is the case,

293
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
that we still have a long ways to go.

294
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So what does that mean for you? Well the first thing is,

295
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I wouldn't start building up personal stockpiles of anything --

296
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
for yourself, your family, or your employees --

297
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
unless you've really done your homework.

298
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
What mask works, what mask doesn't work.

299
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
How many masks do you need?

300
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
The Institute of Medicine study felt that

301
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
you could not recycle masks.

302
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Well if you think it's going to last 18 months,

303
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
are you going to buy 18 months worth of masks

304
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
for every single person in your family?

305
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
We don't know -- again with Tamiflu,

306
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
the number one side effect of Tamiflu is

307
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
flu-like symptoms.

308
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So then how can you tell

309
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
who in your family has the flu

310
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
if everybody is taking Tamiflu?

311
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
If you expand that out to think of a whole community,

312
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
or all your employees in your company,

313
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
you begin to realize how limited

314
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
the Tamiflu option might be.

315
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Everybody has come up to me and said,

316
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
well I'll stockpile water or, I'll stockpile food, or what have you.

317
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
But really? Do you really have a place

318
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
to stockpile 18 months worth of food? Twenty-four months worth of food?

319
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Do you want to view the pandemic threat

320
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
the way back in the 1950s

321
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
people viewed the civil defense issue,

322
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu?

323
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
I don't think that's rational.

324
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
I think it's about having to be prepared

325
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
as communities, not as individuals --

326
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
being prepared as nation,

327
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
being prepared as state, being prepared as town.

328
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
And right now most of the preparedness

329
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
is deeply flawed.

330
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And I hope I've convinced you of that,

331
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
which means that the real job is go out and

332
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
say to your local leaders,

333
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and your national leaders,

334
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
"Why haven't you solved these problems?

335
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Why are you still thinking that

336
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
the lessons of Katrina do not apply to flu?"

337
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And put the pressure where the pressure needs to be put.

338
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
But I guess the other thing to add is,

339
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
if you do have employees, and you do have a company,

340
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
I think you have certain responsibilities

341
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
to demonstrate that you are thinking ahead for them,

342
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and you are trying to plan.

343
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
At a minimum the British banking plan showed that

344
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
telecommuting can be helpful.

345
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
It probably does reduce exposure

346
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
because people are not coming into the office and coughing on each other,

347
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
or touching common objects

348
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and sharing things via their hands.

349
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
But can you sustain your company that way?

350
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Well if you have a dot-com, maybe you can.

351
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Otherwise you're in trouble.

352
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
Happy to take your questions.

353
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
(Applause)

354
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Audience member: What factors determine the duration of a pandemic?

355
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Laurie Garret: What factors determine the duration of a pandemic, we don't really know.

356
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
I could give you a bunch of flip, this, that, and the other.

357
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
But I would say that honestly we don't know.

358
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Clearly the bottom line is

359
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
the virus eventually attenuates,

360
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and ceases to be a lethal virus to humanity,

361
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and finds other hosts.

362
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
But we don't really know how and why that happens.

363
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
It's a very complicated ecology.

364
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Audience member: What kind of triggers are you looking for?

365
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
You know way more than any of us.

366
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
To say ahh, if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic?

367
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
LG: The moment that you see any evidence

368
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
of serious human-to-human to transmission.

369
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Not just intimately between family members

370
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
who took care of an ailing sister or brother,

371
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
but a community infected --

372
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
spread within a school,

373
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
spread within a dormitory, something of that nature.

374
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Then I think that there is universal agreement

375
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
now, at WHO all the way down:

376
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Send out the alert.

377
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
Audience member: Some research has indicated that statins can be helpful.

378
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Can you talk about that?

379
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
LG: Yeah. There is some evidence that taking Lipitor

380
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and other common statins for cholesterol control

381
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
may decrease your vulnerability

382
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
to influenza.

383
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
But we do not completely understand why.

384
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
The mechanism isn't clear.

385
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
And I don't know that there is any way

386
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
responsibly for someone to start

387
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
medicating their children

388
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
with their personal supply of Lipitor or something of that nature.

389
0:16:48.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
We have absolutely no idea what that would do.

390
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
You might be causing some very dangerous outcomes

391
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
in your children, doing such a thing.

392
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Audience member: How far along are we in being able to determine

393
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
whether someone is actually carrying, whether somebody has this

394
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
before the symptoms are full-blown?

395
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
LG: Right. So I have for a long time said

396
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
that what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic.

397
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
And our Centers for Disease Control

398
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
has labeled a test they developed

399
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
a rapid diagnostic.

400
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
It takes 24 hours in a very highly developed laboratory,

401
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
in highly skilled hands.

402
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
I'm thinking dipstick.

403
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
You could do it to your own kid. It changes color.

404
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:28,000
It tells you if you have H5N1.

405
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
In terms of where we are in science

406
0:17:32.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
with DNA identification capacities and so on,

407
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:38,000
it's not that far off.

408
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
But we're not there. And there hasn't been the kind of investment to get us there.

409
0:17:43.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Audience member: In the 1918 flu I understand that

410
0:17:46.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
they theorized that there was some attenuation

411
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
of the virus when it made the leap into humans.

412
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Is that likely, do you think, here?

413
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:17:58,000
I mean 100 percent death rate

414
0:17:58.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
is pretty severe.

415
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:04,000
LG: Um yeah. So we don't actually know

416
0:18:04.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
what the lethality was

417
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:11,000
of the 1918 strain to wild birds

418
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
before it jumped from birds to humans.

419
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
It's curious that there is no evidence

420
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:17,000
of mass die-offs of chickens

421
0:18:17.16,000 --> 0:18:2,000
or household birds across America

422
0:18:20.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
before the human pandemic happened.

423
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
That may be because those events

424
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:26,000
were occurring on the other side of the world

425
0:18:26.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
where nobody was paying attention.

426
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:32,000
But the virus clearly

427
0:18:32.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
went through one round around the world

428
0:18:34.16,000 --> 0:18:36,000
in a mild enough form

429
0:18:36.16,000 --> 0:18:39,000
that the British army in World War I

430
0:18:39.16,000 --> 0:18:42,000
actually certified that it was not a threat

431
0:18:42.16,000 --> 0:18:45,000
and would not affect the outcome of the war.

432
0:18:45.16,000 --> 0:18:47,000
And after circulating around the world

433
0:18:47.16,000 --> 0:18:52,000
came back in a form that was tremendously lethal.

434
0:18:52.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
What percentage of infected people were killed by it?

435
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:58,000
Again we don't really know for sure.

436
0:18:58.16,000 --> 0:19:,000
It's clear that if you were malnourished to begin with,

437
0:19:00.16,000 --> 0:19:02,000
you had a weakened immune system,

438
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:05,000
you lived in poverty in India or Africa,

439
0:19:05.16,000 --> 0:19:08,000
your likelihood of dying was far greater.

440
0:19:08.16,000 --> 0:19:11,000
But we don't really know.

441
0:19:11.16,000 --> 0:19:13,000
Audience member: One of the things I've heard is that

442
0:19:13.16,000 --> 0:19:16,000
the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia,

443
0:19:16.16,000 --> 0:19:18,000
and that a pneumonia vaccine

444
0:19:18.16,000 --> 0:19:22,000
may offer you 50 percent better chance of survival.

445
0:19:22.16,000 --> 0:19:26,000
LG: For a long time, researchers in emerging diseases

446
0:19:26.16,000 --> 0:19:28,000
were kind of dismissive of the pandemic flu threat

447
0:19:28.16,000 --> 0:19:3,000
on the grounds that

448
0:19:30.16,000 --> 0:19:32,000
back in 1918 they didn't have antibiotics.

449
0:19:32.16,000 --> 0:19:35,000
And that most people who die of regular flu --

450
0:19:35.16,000 --> 0:19:37,000
which in regular flu years

451
0:19:37.16,000 --> 0:19:4,000
is about 360,000 people worldwide,

452
0:19:40.16,000 --> 0:19:42,000
most of them senior citizens --

453
0:19:42.16,000 --> 0:19:46,000
and they die not of the flu but because the flu gives an assault to their immune system.

454
0:19:46.16,000 --> 0:19:48,000
And along comes pneumococcus

455
0:19:48.16,000 --> 0:19:5,000
or another bacteria, streptococcus

456
0:19:50.16,000 --> 0:19:52,000
and boom, they get a bacterial pneumonia.

457
0:19:52.16,000 --> 0:19:55,000
But it turns out that in 1918 that was not the case at all.

458
0:19:55.16,000 --> 0:19:58,000
And so far in the H5N1 cases in people,

459
0:19:58.16,000 --> 0:20:,000
similarly bacterial infection

460
0:20:00.16,000 --> 0:20:02,000
has not been an issue at all.

461
0:20:02.16,000 --> 0:20:07,000
It's this absolutely phenomenal disruption of the immune system

462
0:20:07.16,000 --> 0:20:1,000
that is the key to why people die of this virus.

463
0:20:10.16,000 --> 0:20:12,000
And I would just add

464
0:20:12.16,000 --> 0:20:14,000
we saw the same thing with SARS.

465
0:20:14.16,000 --> 0:20:17,000
So what's going on here is your body says,

466
0:20:17.16,000 --> 0:20:21,000
your immune system sends out all its sentinels and says,

467
0:20:21.16,000 --> 0:20:23,000
"I don't know what the heck this is.

468
0:20:23.16,000 --> 0:20:26,000
We've never seen anything even remotely like this before."

469
0:20:26.16,000 --> 0:20:29,000
It won't do any good to bring in the sharpshooters

470
0:20:29.16,000 --> 0:20:31,000
because those antibodies aren't here.

471
0:20:31.16,000 --> 0:20:34,000
And it won't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery

472
0:20:34.16,000 --> 0:20:37,000
because those T-cells don't recognize it either.

473
0:20:37.16,000 --> 0:20:4,000
So we're going to have to go all-out thermonuclear response,

474
0:20:40.16,000 --> 0:20:43,000
stimulate the total cytokine cascade.

475
0:20:43.16,000 --> 0:20:46,000
The whole immune system swarms into the lungs.

476
0:20:46.16,000 --> 0:20:49,000
And yes they die, drowning in their own fluids, of pneumonia.

477
0:20:49.16,000 --> 0:20:51,000
But it's not bacterial pneumonia.

478
0:20:51.16,000 --> 0:20:55,000
And it's not a pneumonia that would respond to a vaccine.

479
0:20:55.16,000 --> 0:20:58,000
And I think my time is up. I thank you all for your attention.

480
0:20:58.16,000 --> 0:20:59,000
(Applause)

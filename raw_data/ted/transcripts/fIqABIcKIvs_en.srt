1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I want to say that really and truly,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
after these incredible speeches

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and ideas that are being spread,

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I am in the awkward position

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
of being here to talk to you today

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
about television.

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So most everyone watches TV.

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
We like it. We like some parts of it.

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Here in America, people actually love TV.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
The average American watches TV

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
for almost 5 hours a day.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Okay?

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Now I happen to make my living these days in television,

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
so for me, that's a good thing.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But a lot of people don't love it so much.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
They, in fact, berate it.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
They call it stupid,

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and worse, believe me.

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
My mother, growing up,

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
she called it the "idiot box."

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But my idea today is not to debate

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
whether there's such a thing as good TV or bad TV;

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
my idea today

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
is to tell you that I believe

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
television has a conscience.

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So why I believe that television has a conscience

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
is that I actually believe

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that television directly reflects

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
the moral, political,

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
social and emotional need states of our nation --

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that television is how we actually disseminate

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
our entire value system.

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So all these things are uniquely human,

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and they all add up

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to our idea of conscience.

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Now today, we're not talking about good and bad TV.

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
We're talking about popular TV.

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
We're talking about top-10 Nielsen-rated shows

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
over the course of 50 years.

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
How do these Nielsen ratings

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
reflect not just what you've heard about,

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
which is the idea of our social, collective unconscious,

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
but how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated shows

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
over 50 years

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
reflect the idea

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
of our social conscience?

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
How does television evolve over time,

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and what does this say about our society?

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Now speaking of evolution,

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
from basic biology, you probably remember

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that the animal kingdom, including humans,

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
have four basic primal instincts.

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
You have hunger; you have sex; you have power;

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and you have the urge for acquisitiveness.

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
As humans, what's important to remember

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is that we've developed, we've evolved over time

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to temper, or tame,

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
these basic animal instincts.

59
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
We have the capacity to laugh and cry.

60
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We feel awe, we feel pity.

61
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
That is separate and apart

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
from the animal kingdom.

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The other thing about human beings

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
is that we love to be entertained.

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We love to watch TV.

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
This is something that clearly separates us

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
from the animal kingdom.

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Animals might love to play,

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but they don't love to watch.

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So I had an ambition

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to discover what could be understood

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
from this uniquely human relationship

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
between television programs

74
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and the human conscious.

75
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has?

76
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I kind of think of it

77
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
as this cartoon devil or angel

78
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
sitting on our shoulders.

79
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Is television literally functioning

80
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
as our conscience,

81
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
tempting us and rewarding us at the same time?

82
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So to begin to answer these questions,

83
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
we did a research study.

84
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We went back 50 years

85
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
to the 1959/1960 television season.

86
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We surveyed the top-20 Nielsen shows

87
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
every year for 50 years --

88
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
a thousand shows.

89
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
We talked to over 3,000 individuals --

90
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
almost 3,600 --

91
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
aged 18 to 70,

92
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and we asked them how they felt emotionally.

93
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
How did you feel

94
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
watching every single one of these shows?

95
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity?

96
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Did you feel outrage? Did you laugh?

97
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
What did this mean for you?

98
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So to our global TED audiences,

99
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I want to say that this was a U.S. sample.

100
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But as you can see,

101
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
these emotional need states are truly universal.

102
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And on a factual basis,

103
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
over 80 percent of the U.S.'s most popular shows

104
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
are exported around the world.

105
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So I really hope our global audiences

106
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
can relate.

107
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Two acknowledgments

108
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
before our first data slide:

109
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
For inspiring me

110
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
to even think about the idea of conscience

111
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis,

112
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I thank legendary rabbi, Jack Stern.

113
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And for the way in which I'm going to present the data,

114
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling,

115
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
who you may have just seen.

116
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Okay, here we go.

117
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So here you see,

118
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
from 1960 to 2010,

119
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the 50 years of our study.

120
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Two things we're going to start with --

121
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state,

122
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
which, for this purpose,

123
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
we defined inspiration

124
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
as television shows that uplift me,

125
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that make me feel much more positive about the world.

126
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Moral ambiguity are televisions shows

127
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
in which I don't understand

128
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the difference between right and wrong.

129
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
As we start, you see in 1960

130
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
inspiration is holding steady.

131
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
That's what we're watching TV for.

132
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Moral ambiguity starts to climb.

133
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Right at the end of the 60s,

134
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
moral ambiguity is going up,

135
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
inspiration is kind of on the wane.

136
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Why?

137
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK is shot,

138
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
the Civil Rights movement,

139
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
race riots, the Vietnam War,

140
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
MLK is shot, Bobby Kennedy is shot,

141
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Watergate.

142
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Look what happens.

143
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
In 1970, inspiration plummets.

144
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Moral ambiguity takes off.

145
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
They cross,

146
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
but Ronald Reagan, a telegenic president, is in office.

147
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It's trying to recover.

148
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
But look, it can't:

149
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
AIDS, Iran-Contra,

150
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
the Challenger disaster, Chernobyl.

151
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television

152
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
from 1990 for the next 20 years.

153
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Take a look at this.

154
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
This chart is going to document a very similar trend.

155
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But in this case, we have comfort -- the bubble in red --

156
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
social commentary and irreverence

157
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
in blue and green.

158
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Now this time on TV

159
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
you have "Bonanza," don't forget, you have "Gunsmoke,"

160
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
you have "Andy Griffith,"

161
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
you have domestic shows all about comfort.

162
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
This is rising. Comfort stays whole.

163
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Irreverence starts to rise.

164
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up.

165
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
You get to 1969, and look what happens.

166
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
You have comfort, irreverence, and social commentary,

167
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
not only battling it out in our society,

168
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
but you literally have two establishment shows --

169
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
"Gunsmoke" and "Gomer Pyle" --

170
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows.

171
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
What's number one?

172
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
The socially irreverent hippie show,

173
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
"Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In."

174
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
They're all living together, right.

175
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Viewers had responded dramatically.

176
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Look at this green spike in 1966

177
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to a bellwether show.

178
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
When you guys hear this industry term, a breakout hit,

179
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
what does that mean?

180
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It means in the 1966 television season,

181
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The "Smothers Brothers" came out of nowhere.

182
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
This was the first show

183
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that allowed viewers to say,

184
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
"My God,

185
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War,

186
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
about the presidency, through television?"

187
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
That's what we mean by a breakout show.

188
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So then, just like the last chart, look what happens.

189
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
In 1970,

190
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the dam bursts. The dam bursts.

191
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Comfort is no longer why we watch television.

192
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Social commentary and irreverence

193
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
rise throughout the 70s.

194
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Now look at this.

195
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
The 70s means who? Norman Lear.

196
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
You have "All in the Family," "Sanford and Son,"

197
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and the dominant show --

198
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
in the top-10 for the entire 70s --

199
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
"MAS*H."

200
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
In the entire 50 years

201
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
of television that we studied,

202
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
seven of 10 shows

203
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
ranked most highly for irreverence

204
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
appeared on air during the Vietnam War,

205
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
five of the top-10 during the Nixon administration.

206
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Only one generation, 20 years in,

207
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and we discovered,

208
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Wow! TV can do that?

209
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
It can make me feel this?

210
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It can change us?

211
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So to this very, very savvy crowd,

212
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I also want to note

213
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
the digital folks did not invent disruptive.

214
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair

215
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
along with the rest of us

216
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
40 years ago.

217
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
This is a quick chart. Here's another attribute:

218
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
fantasy and imagination,

219
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
which are shows defined as,

220
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
"takes me out of my everyday realm"

221
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and "makes me feel better."

222
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
That's mapped against the red dot, unemployment,

223
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic.

224
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
You'll see

225
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise,

226
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
it maps to a spike in unemployment.

227
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Do we want to see shows

228
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
about people saving money and being unemployed?

229
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
No. In the 70s

230
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
you have the bellwether show "The Bionic Woman"

231
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that rocketed into the top-10 in 1973,

232
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
followed by the "Six Million-Dollar Man" and "Charlie's Angels."

233
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Another spike in the 1980s --

234
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
another spike in shows about control and power.

235
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
What were those shows?

236
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Glamorous and rich.

237
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
"Dallas," "Fantasy Island."

238
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Incredible mapping of our national psyche

239
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
with some hard and fast facts:

240
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
unemployment.

241
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So here you are, in my favorite chart,

242
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
because this is our last 20 years.

243
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
Whether or not you're in my business,

244
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
you have surely heard or read

245
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
of the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom

246
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and the rise of reality TV.

247
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Well, as we say in the business,

248
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
X marks the spot.

249
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
The 90s -- the big bubbles of humor --

250
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
we're watching "Friends," "Frasier," "Cheers" and "Seinfeld."

251
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Everything's good, low unemployment.

252
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But look: X marks the spot.

253
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
In 2001,

254
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
the September 2001 television season,

255
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
humor succumbs to judgment once and for all.

256
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Why not?

257
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
We had a 2000 presidential election

258
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
decided by the Supreme Court.

259
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We had the bursting of the tech bubble.

260
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We had 9/11.

261
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon.

262
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Look what happens when we keep going.

263
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
At the turn of the century, the Internet takes off,

264
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
reality television has taken hold.

265
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
What do people want in their TV then?

266
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
I would have thought revenge

267
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
or nostalgia.

268
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Give me some comfort; my world is falling apart.

269
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
No, they want judgment.

270
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I can vote you off the island.

271
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I can keep Sarah Palin's daughter dancing.

272
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I can choose the next American Idol. You're fired.

273
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
That's all great, right?

274
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So as dramatically different as these television shows,

275
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
pure entertainment, have been over the last 50 years --

276
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
what did I start with? --

277
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
one basic instinct remains.

278
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
We're animals, we need our moms.

279
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
There has not been a decade of television

280
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
without a definitive, dominant TV mom.

281
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
The 1950s:

282
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
June Cleever in the original comfort show, "Leave it to Beaver."

283
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Lucille Ball kept us laughing

284
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s.

285
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Maude Findlay,

286
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
the epitome of the irreverent 1970s,

287
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
who tackled abortion, divorce,

288
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
even menopause on TV.

289
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
The 1980s,

290
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
our first cougar was given to us

291
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
in the form of Alexis Carrington.

292
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Murphy Brown took on a vice president

293
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
when she took on the idea of single parenthood.

294
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
This era's mom,

295
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Bree Van de Kamp.

296
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Now I don't know if this is the devil or the angel

297
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
sitting on our conscience,

298
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
sitting on television's shoulders,

299
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
but I do know that I absolutely love this image.

300
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
So to you all,

301
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
the women of TEDWomen, the men of TEDWomen,

302
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
the global audiences of TEDWomen,

303
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
thank you for letting me present my idea

304
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
about the conscience of television.

305
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
But let me also thank the incredible creators

306
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
who get up everyday

307
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
to put their ideas on our television screens

308
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
throughout all these ages of television.

309
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
They give it life on television, for sure,

310
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
but it's you as viewers,

311
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
through your collective social consciences,

312
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
that give it life, longevity,

313
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
power or not.

314
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
So thanks very much.

315
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Applause)

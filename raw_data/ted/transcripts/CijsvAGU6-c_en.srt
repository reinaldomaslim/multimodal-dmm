1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Good afternoon, everybody.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I've got something to show you.

3
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Think about this as a pixel, a flying pixel.

5
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
This is what we call, in our lab, sensible design.

6
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Let me tell you a bit about it.

7
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Now if you take this picture -- I'm Italian originally,

8
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and every boy in Italy grows up

9
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
with this picture on the wall of his bedroom --

10
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but the reason I'm showing you this

11
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is that something very interesting

12
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
happened in Formula 1 racing

13
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
over the past couple of decades.

14
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Now some time ago,

15
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race,

16
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
you take a budget, and you bet your budget

17
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
on a good driver and a good car.

18
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And if the car and the driver were good enough, then you'd win the race.

19
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now today, if you want to win the race,

20
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
actually you need also something like this --

21
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
something that monitors the car in real time,

22
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
has a few thousand sensors

23
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
collecting information from the car,

24
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
transmitting this information into the system,

25
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and then processing it

26
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions

27
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and changing things in real time

28
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
as information is collected.

29
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
This is what, in engineering terms,

30
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
you would call a real time control system.

31
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And basically, it's a system made of two components --

32
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
a sensing and an actuating component.

33
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
What is interesting today

34
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is that real time control systems

35
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
are starting to enter into our lives.

36
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Our cities, over the past few years,

37
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
just have been blanketed

38
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
with networks, electronics.

39
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
They're becoming like computers in open air.

40
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And, as computers in open air,

41
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
they're starting to respond in a different way

42
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to be able to be sensed and to be actuated.

43
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
If we fix cities, actually it's a big deal.

44
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Just as an aside, I wanted to mention,

45
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust,

46
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
but they are 50 percent of the world's population.

47
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
They are 75 percent of the energy consumption --

48
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.

49
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So if we're able to do something with cities, that's a big deal.

50
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Beyond cities,

51
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
all of this sensing and actuating

52
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
is entering our everyday objects.

53
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
That's from an exhibition that

54
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Paola Antonelli is organizing

55
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
at MoMA later this year, during the summer.

56
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It's called "Talk to Me."

57
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Well our objects, our environment

58
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
is starting to talk back to us.

59
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
In a certain sense, it's almost as if every atom out there

60
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
were becoming both a sensor and an actuator.

61
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans

62
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
with the environment out there.

63
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
In a certain sense,

64
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ...

65
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
you know, when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses,

66
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
at the end it said that he took the hammer, threw it at the Moses --

67
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
actually you can still see a small chip underneath --

68
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and said, shouted,

69
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
"Perché non parli? Why don't you talk?"

70
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Well today, for the first time,

71
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
our environment is starting to talk back to us.

72
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And I'll show just a few examples --

73
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
again, with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it.

74
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Let's starting with sensing.

75
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Well, the first project I wanted to share with you

76
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
is actually one of the first projects by our lab.

77
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It was four and a half years ago in Italy.

78
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And what we did there

79
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
was actually use a new type of network at the time

80
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that had been deployed all across the world --

81
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that's a cellphone network --

82
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network,

83
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that's collected anyway by the operator,

84
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
in order to understand

85
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
how the city works.

86
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
The summer was a lucky summer -- 2006.

87
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It's when Italy won the soccer World Cup.

88
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Some of you might remember, it was Italy and France playing,

89
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and then Zidane at the end, the headbutt.

90
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And anyway, Italy won at the end.

91
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Now look at what happened that day

93
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
just by monitoring activity

94
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
happening on the network.

95
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Here you see the city.

96
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
You see the Colosseum in the middle,

97
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
the river Tiber.

98
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It's morning, before the match.

99
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
You see the timeline on the top.

100
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Early afternoon,

101
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
people here and there,

102
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
making calls and moving.

103
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The match begins -- silence.

104
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
France scores. Italy scores.

105
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Halftime, people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.

106
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Second half. End of normal time.

107
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
First overtime, second.

108
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Zidane, the headbutt in a moment.

109
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Italy wins. Yeah.

110
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

111
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Applause)

112
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Well, that night, everybody went to celebrate in the center.

113
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
You saw the big peak.

114
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
The following day, again everybody went to the center

115
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
to meet the winning team

116
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and the prime minister at the time.

117
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And then everybody moved down.

118
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo,

119
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
where, since Roman times, people go to celebrate,

120
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
to have a big party, and you see the peak at the end of the day.

121
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Well, that's just one example of how we can sense the city today

122
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
in a way that we couldn't have done

123
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
just a few years ago.

124
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Another quick example about sensing:

125
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
it's not about people,

126
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but about things we use and consume.

127
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Well today, we know everything

128
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
about where our objects come from.

129
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
This is a map that shows you

130
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
all the chips that form a Mac computer, how they came together.

131
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
But we know very little about where things go.

132
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So in this project,

133
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
we actually developed some small tags

134
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to track trash as it moves through the system.

135
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So we actually started with a number of volunteers

136
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
who helped us in Seattle,

137
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
just over a year ago,

138
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
to tag what they were throwing away --

139
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
different types of things, as you can see here --

140
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
things they would throw away anyway.

141
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Then we put a little chip, little tag,

142
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
onto the trash

143
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and then started following it.

144
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Here are the results we just obtained.

145
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Music)

146
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
From Seattle ...

147
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
after one week.

148
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
With this information we realized

149
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
there's a lot of inefficiencies in the system.

150
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
We can actually do the same thing with much less energy.

151
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
This data was not available before.

152
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
But there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening.

153
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
But the other thing is that we believe

154
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that if we see every day

155
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that the cup we're throwing away, it doesn't disappear,

156
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
it's still somewhere on the planet.

157
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there.

158
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And if we show that to people,

159
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
then we can also promote some behavioral change.

160
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So that was the reason for the project.

161
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
My colleague at MIT, Assaf Biderman,

162
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
he could tell you much more about sensing

163
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing,

164
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning,

165
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and that's actuating our environment.

166
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And the first project

167
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza, Spain.

168
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It started with a question by the mayor of the city,

169
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
who came to us saying

170
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition

171
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
of using water in public space, in architecture.

172
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And the question was: How could technology, new technology,

173
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
be added to that?

174
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop

175
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
was, imagine this pipe, and you've got valves,

176
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
solenoid valves, taps,

177
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
opening and closing.

178
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
You create like a water curtain with pixels made of water.

179
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
If those pixels fall,

180
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
you can write on it,

181
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
you can show patterns, images, text.

182
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And even you can approach it, and it will open up

183
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
to let you jump through,

184
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
as you see in this image.

185
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Well, we presented this to Mayor Belloch.

186
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
He liked it very much.

187
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And we got a commission to design a building

188
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
at the entrance of the expo.

189
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
We called it Digital Water Pavilion.

190
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
The whole building is made of water.

191
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
There's no doors or windows,

192
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
but when you approach it,

193
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
it will open up to let you in.

194
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
(Music)

195
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
The roof also is covered with water.

196
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And if there's a bit of wind,

197
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
if you want to minimize splashing, you can actually lower the roof.

198
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Or you could close the building,

199
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and the whole architecture will disappear,

200
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
like in this case.

201
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
You know, these days, you always get images during the winter,

202
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
when they take the roof down,

203
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
of people who have been there and said, "They demolished the building."

204
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
No, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down,

205
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
the architecture almost disappears.

206
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Here's the building working.

207
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside.

208
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And here was myself trying not to get wet,

209
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
testing the sensors that open the water.

210
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Well, I should tell you now what happened one night

211
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
when all of the sensors stopped working.

212
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
But actually that night, it was even more fun.

213
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building,

214
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
because the way of engaging with the building became something different.

215
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in,

216
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water,

217
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and you had to jump without getting wet.

218
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
(Video) (Crowd Noise)

219
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And that was, for us, was very interesting,

220
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
because, as architects, as engineers, as designers,

221
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
we always think about how people will use the things we design.

222
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
But then reality's always unpredictable.

223
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And that's the beauty of doing things

224
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that are used and interact with people.

225
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Here is an image then of the building

226
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
with the physical pixels, the pixels made of water,

227
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and then projections on them.

228
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And this is what led us to think about

229
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the following project I'll show you now.

230
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
That's, imagine those pixels could actually start flying.

231
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Imagine you could have small helicopters

232
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that move in the air,

233
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights --

234
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
almost as a cloud that can move in space.

235
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Here is the video.

236
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
(Music)

237
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So imagine one helicopter,

238
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
like the one we saw before,

239
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
moving with others,

240
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
in synchrony.

241
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So you can have this cloud.

242
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
You can have a kind of flexible screen or display, like this --

243
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
a regular configuration in two dimensions.

244
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Or in regular, but in three dimensions,

245
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
where the thing that changes is the light,

246
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
not the pixels' position.

247
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
You can play with a different type.

248
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Imagine your screen could just appear

249
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
in different scales or sizes,

250
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
different types of resolution.

251
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
But then the whole thing can be

252
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
just a 3D cloud of pixels

253
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
that you can approach and move through it

254
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and see from many, many directions.

255
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Here is the real Flyfire

256
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
control and going down to form the regular grid as before.

257
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
When you turn on the light, actually you see this. So the same as we saw before.

258
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And imagine each of them then controlled by people.

259
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
You can have each pixel

260
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
having an input that comes from people,

261
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
from people's movement, or so and so.

262
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
I want to show you something here for the first time.

263
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
We've been working with Roberto Bolle,

264
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
one of today's top ballet dancers --

265
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
the étoile at Metropolitan in New York

266
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and La Scala in Milan --

267
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and actually captured his movement in 3D

268
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
in order to use it as an input for Flyfire.

269
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And here you can see Roberto dancing.

270
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
You see on the left the pixels,

271
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
the different resolutions being captured.

272
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
It's both 3D scanning in real time

273
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and motion capture.

274
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
So you can reconstruct a whole movement.

275
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
You can go all the way through.

276
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
But then, once we have the pixels, then you can play with them

277
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and play with color and movement

278
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and gravity and rotation.

279
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
So we want to use this as one of the possible inputs

280
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
for Flyfire.

281
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
I wanted to show you the last project we are working on.

282
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
It's something we're working on for the London Olympics.

283
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
It's called The Cloud.

284
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And the idea here is, imagine, again,

285
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
we can involve people

286
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
in doing something and changing our environment --

287
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
almost to impart what we call cloud raising --

288
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
like barn raising, but with a cloud.

289
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel.

290
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And I think what is remarkable

291
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
that has happened over the past couple of years

292
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
is that, over the past couple of decades,

293
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
we went from the physical world to the digital one.

294
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
This has been digitizing everything, knowledge,

295
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and making that accessible through the Internet.

296
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Now today, for the first time --

297
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and the Obama campaign showed us this --

298
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
we can go from the digital world,

299
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
from the self-organizing power of networks,

300
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
to the physical one.

301
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
This can be, in our case,

302
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol.

303
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
That means something built in a city.

304
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
But tomorrow it can be,

305
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
in order to tackle today's pressing challenges --

306
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
think about climate change or CO2 emissions --

307
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
how we can go from the digital world to the physical one.

308
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
So the idea that we can actually involve people

309
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
in doing this thing together, collectively.

310
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels,

311
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
in the same way as the real cloud

312
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
is a cloud made of particles.

313
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
And those particles are water,

314
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
where our cloud is a cloud of pixels.

315
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels.

316
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
You can move inside, have different types of experiences.

317
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
You can actually see from underneath,

318
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
sharing the main moments

319
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
for the Olympics in 2012 and beyond,

320
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and really using it as a way to connect with the community.

321
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
So both the physical cloud in the sky

322
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and something you can go to the top [of],

323
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
like London's new mountaintop.

324
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
You can enter inside it.

325
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
And a kind of new digital beacon for the night --

326
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
but most importantly,

327
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top.

328
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Thank you.

329
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
(Applause)

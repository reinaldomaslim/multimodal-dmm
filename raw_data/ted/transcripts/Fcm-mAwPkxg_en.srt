1
0:00:13.084,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Like many of us,

2
0:00:14.818,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I've had several careers in my life,

3
0:00:17.214,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and although they've been varied,

4
0:00:19.389,000 --> 0:00:22,000
my first job set the foundation for all of them.

5
0:00:23.3,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I was a home-birth midwife throughout my 20s.

6
0:00:27.623,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Delivering babies taught me valuable and sometimes surprising things,

7
0:00:32.771,000 --> 0:00:34,000
like how to start a car at 2am.

8
0:00:35.565,000 --> 0:00:36,000
when it's 10 degrees below zero.

9
0:00:37.387,000 --> 0:00:38,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:38.412,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Or how to revive a father who's fainted at the sight of blood.

11
0:00:42.771,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:43.846,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Or how to cut the umbilical cord just so,

13
0:00:46.316,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to make a beautiful belly button.

14
0:00:48.561,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But those aren't the things that stuck with me or guided me

15
0:00:52.37,000 --> 0:00:55,000
when I stopped being a midwife and started other jobs.

16
0:00:56.378,000 --> 0:01:,000
What stuck with me was this bedrock belief

17
0:01:00.495,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that each one of us comes into this world with a unique worth.

18
0:01:06.282,000 --> 0:01:09,000
When I looked into the face of a newborn,

19
0:01:10.192,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I caught a glimpse of that worthiness,

20
0:01:13.909,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that sense of unapologetic selfhood,

21
0:01:16.775,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that unique spark.

22
0:01:20.586,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I use the word "soul" to describe that spark,

23
0:01:24.367,000 --> 0:01:28,000
because it's the only word in English that comes close to naming

24
0:01:29.03,000 --> 0:01:31,000
what each baby brought into the room.

25
0:01:32.623,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Every newborn was as singular as a snowflake,

26
0:01:37.315,000 --> 0:01:4,000
a matchless mash-up of biology

27
0:01:40.71,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and ancestry and mystery.

28
0:01:43.914,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And then that baby grows up,

29
0:01:46.055,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and in order to fit into the family,

30
0:01:48.194,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to conform to the culture,

31
0:01:50.259,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to the community, to the gender,

32
0:01:53.174,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that little one begins to cover its soul,

33
0:01:56.14,000 --> 0:01:57,000
layer by layer.

34
0:01:58.197,000 --> 0:01:59,000
We're born this way,

35
0:02:00.405,000 --> 0:02:01,000
but --

36
0:02:01.587,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Laughter)

37
0:02:03.203,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But as we grow, a lot of things happen to us

38
0:02:06.64,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that make us ...

39
0:02:09.815,000 --> 0:02:14,000
want to hide our soulful eccentricities and authenticity.

40
0:02:14.983,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We've all done this.

41
0:02:16.374,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Everyone in this room is a former baby --

42
0:02:19.237,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:20.283,000 --> 0:02:22,000
with a distinctive birthright.

44
0:02:23.56,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But as adults, we spend so much of our time uncomfortable in our own skin,

45
0:02:28.8,000 --> 0:02:31,000
like we have ADD: authenticity deficit disorder.

46
0:02:33.449,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But not those babies --

47
0:02:35.081,000 --> 0:02:36,000
not yet.

48
0:02:36.347,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Their message to me was:

49
0:02:38.453,000 --> 0:02:4,000
uncover your soul

50
0:02:40.728,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and look for that soul-spark

51
0:02:43.945,000 --> 0:02:44,000
in everyone else.

52
0:02:45.179,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It's still there.

53
0:02:47.172,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And here's what I learned from laboring women.

54
0:02:50.414,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Their message was about staying open,

55
0:02:53.438,000 --> 0:02:55,000
even when things are painful.

56
0:02:56.584,000 --> 0:02:58,000
A woman's cervix normally looks like this.

57
0:02:59.036,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It's a tight little muscle

58
0:03:01.21,000 --> 0:03:02,000
at the base of the uterus.

59
0:03:03.243,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And during labor, it has to stretch from this

60
0:03:07.576,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to this.

61
0:03:08.982,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Ouch!

62
0:03:10.269,000 --> 0:03:12,000
If you fight against that pain,

63
0:03:13.343,000 --> 0:03:14,000
you just create more pain,

64
0:03:15.051,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and you block what wants to be born.

65
0:03:18.482,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I'll never forget the magic that would happen

66
0:03:22.344,000 --> 0:03:24,000
when a woman stopped resisting the pain

67
0:03:26.185,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and opened.

68
0:03:27.496,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It was as if the forces of the universe took notice

69
0:03:31.211,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and sent in a wave of help.

70
0:03:33.973,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I never forgot that message,

71
0:03:35.919,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and now, when difficult or painful things happen to me

72
0:03:39.963,000 --> 0:03:4,000
in my life or my work,

73
0:03:41.909,000 --> 0:03:43,000
of course at first I resist them,

74
0:03:44.561,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but then I remember what I learned from the mothers:

75
0:03:47.809,000 --> 0:03:48,000
stay open.

76
0:03:49.508,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Stay curious.

77
0:03:50.961,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Ask the pain what it's come to deliver.

78
0:03:54.017,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Something new wants to be born.

79
0:03:57.311,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And there was one more big soulful lesson,

80
0:03:59.633,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and that one I learned from Albert Einstein.

81
0:04:02.769,000 --> 0:04:03,000
He wasn't at any of the births, but --

82
0:04:04.749,000 --> 0:04:05,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:05.805,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It was a lesson about time.

84
0:04:09.732,000 --> 0:04:13,000
At the end of his life, Albert Einstein concluded

85
0:04:13.909,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that our normal, hamster-wheel experience of life

86
0:04:18.083,000 --> 0:04:19,000
is an illusion.

87
0:04:19.843,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We run round and round, faster and faster,

88
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
trying to get somewhere.

89
0:04:24.455,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And all the while,

90
0:04:27.218,000 --> 0:04:3,000
underneath surface time is this whole other dimension

91
0:04:31.288,000 --> 0:04:35,000
where the past and the present and the future merge

92
0:04:36.367,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and become deep time.

93
0:04:39.414,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And there's nowhere to get to.

94
0:04:42.716,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Albert Einstein called this state, this dimension,

95
0:04:47.089,000 --> 0:04:48,000
"only being."

96
0:04:48.774,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And he said when he experienced it,

97
0:04:50.754,000 --> 0:04:52,000
he knew sacred awe.

98
0:04:53.818,000 --> 0:04:54,000
When I was delivering babies,

99
0:04:55.491,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I was forced off the hamster wheel.

100
0:04:57.41,000 --> 0:05:,000
Sometimes I had to sit for days, hours and hours,

101
0:05:01.213,000 --> 0:05:03,000
just breathing with the parents;

102
0:05:03.823,000 --> 0:05:04,000
just being.

103
0:05:05.659,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And I got a big dose of sacred awe.

104
0:05:09.156,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So those are the three lessons I took with me from midwifery.

105
0:05:14.253,000 --> 0:05:16,000
One: uncover your soul.

106
0:05:17.376,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Two: when things get difficult or painful, try to stay open.

107
0:05:23.568,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And three: every now and then, step off your hamster wheel

108
0:05:27.928,000 --> 0:05:28,000
into deep time.

109
0:05:30.946,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Those lessons have served me throughout my life,

110
0:05:34.855,000 --> 0:05:36,000
but they really served me recently,

111
0:05:37.338,000 --> 0:05:41,000
when I took on the most important job of my life thus far.

112
0:05:42.572,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Two years ago, my younger sister came out of remission

113
0:05:46.962,000 --> 0:05:48,000
from a rare blood cancer,

114
0:05:49.719,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and the only treatment left for her was a bone marrow transplant.

115
0:05:54.708,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And against the odds, we found a match for her,

116
0:05:57.821,000 --> 0:05:58,000
who turned out to be me.

117
0:06:00.794,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I come from a family of four girls,

118
0:06:04.075,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and when my sisters found out that I was my sister's perfect genetic match,

119
0:06:10.512,000 --> 0:06:12,000
their reaction was, "Really? You?"

120
0:06:12.866,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Laughter)

121
0:06:14.273,000 --> 0:06:16,000
"A perfect match for her?"

122
0:06:16.453,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Which is pretty typical for siblings.

123
0:06:19.488,000 --> 0:06:21,000
In a sibling society, there's lots of things.

124
0:06:22.221,000 --> 0:06:26,000
There's love and there's friendship and there's protection.

125
0:06:26.442,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But there's also jealousy

126
0:06:28.603,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and competition

127
0:06:30.6,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and rejection and attack.

128
0:06:33.867,000 --> 0:06:38,000
In siblinghood, that's where we start assembling many of those first layers

129
0:06:39.829,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that cover our soul.

130
0:06:42.106,000 --> 0:06:45,000
When I discovered I was my sister's match,

131
0:06:45.133,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I went into research mode.

132
0:06:47.194,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And I discovered that

133
0:06:50.028,000 --> 0:06:52,000
the premise of transplants is pretty straightforward.

134
0:06:52.786,000 --> 0:06:55,000
You destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient

135
0:06:56.07,000 --> 0:06:58,000
with massive doses of chemotherapy,

136
0:06:59.293,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and then you replace that marrow

137
0:07:01.727,000 --> 0:07:04,000
with several million healthy marrow cells from a donor.

138
0:07:05.937,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And then you do everything you can

139
0:07:07.767,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to make sure that those new cells engraft in the patient.

140
0:07:12.076,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I also learned that bone marrow transplants are fraught with danger.

141
0:07:17.468,000 --> 0:07:21,000
If my sister made it through the near-lethal chemotherapy,

142
0:07:22.734,000 --> 0:07:25,000
she still would face other challenges.

143
0:07:25.942,000 --> 0:07:27,000
My cells

144
0:07:28.863,000 --> 0:07:3,000
might attack her body.

145
0:07:31.843,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And her body might reject my cells.

146
0:07:34.846,000 --> 0:07:36,000
They call this rejection or attack,

147
0:07:37.315,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and both could kill her.

148
0:07:39.583,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Rejection. Attack.

149
0:07:42.091,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Those words had a familiar ring

150
0:07:44.306,000 --> 0:07:46,000
in the context of being siblings.

151
0:07:47.843,000 --> 0:07:49,000
My sister and I had a long history of love,

152
0:07:50.676,000 --> 0:07:53,000
but we also had a long history of rejection and attack,

153
0:07:54.487,000 --> 0:07:57,000
from minor misunderstandings to bigger betrayals.

154
0:07:59.172,000 --> 0:08:01,000
We didn't have the kind of the relationship

155
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
where we talked about the deeper stuff;

156
0:08:03.887,000 --> 0:08:07,000
but, like many siblings and like people in all kinds of relationships,

157
0:08:08.987,000 --> 0:08:1,000
we were hesitant to tell our truths,

158
0:08:11.965,000 --> 0:08:13,000
to reveal our wounds,

159
0:08:14.867,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to admit our wrongdoings.

160
0:08:17.18,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But when I learned about the dangers of rejection or attack,

161
0:08:22.095,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I thought, it's time to change this.

162
0:08:25.073,000 --> 0:08:29,000
What if we left the bone marrow transplant up to the doctors,

163
0:08:29.913,000 --> 0:08:34,000
but did something that we later came to call our "soul marrow transplant?"

164
0:08:36.205,000 --> 0:08:39,000
What if we faced any pain we had caused each other,

165
0:08:40.215,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and instead of rejection or attack,

166
0:08:43.454,000 --> 0:08:44,000
could we listen?

167
0:08:45.272,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Could we forgive?

168
0:08:47.116,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Could we merge?

169
0:08:48.58,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Would that teach our cells to do the same?

170
0:08:53.431,000 --> 0:08:57,000
To woo my skeptical sister, I turned to my parents' holy text:

171
0:08:58.268,000 --> 0:08:59,000
the New Yorker Magazine.

172
0:08:59.893,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Laughter)

173
0:09:01.833,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I sent her a cartoon from its pages

174
0:09:05.428,000 --> 0:09:08,000
as a way of explaining why we should visit a therapist

175
0:09:09.077,000 --> 0:09:14,000
before having my bone marrow harvested and transplanted into her body.

176
0:09:14.467,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Here it is.

177
0:09:15.736,000 --> 0:09:19,000
"I have never forgiven him for that thing I made up in my head."

178
0:09:19.874,000 --> 0:09:21,000
(Laughter)

179
0:09:22.305,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I told my sister

180
0:09:24.95,000 --> 0:09:26,000
we had probably been doing the same thing,

181
0:09:27.811,000 --> 0:09:32,000
carting around made-up stories in our heads that kept us separate.

182
0:09:34.184,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And I told her that after the transplant,

183
0:09:37.1,000 --> 0:09:39,000
all of the blood flowing in her veins

184
0:09:39.718,000 --> 0:09:4,000
would be my blood,

185
0:09:41.223,000 --> 0:09:43,000
made from my marrow cells,

186
0:09:44.301,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and that inside the nucleus of each of those cells

187
0:09:48.554,000 --> 0:09:5,000
is a complete set of my DNA.

188
0:09:51.351,000 --> 0:09:54,000
"I will be swimming around in you for the rest of your life,"

189
0:09:54.755,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I told my slightly horrified sister.

190
0:09:57.538,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Laughter)

191
0:09:59.742,000 --> 0:10:02,000
"I think we better clean up our relationship."

192
0:10:04.168,000 --> 0:10:07,000
A health crisis makes people do all sorts of risky things,

193
0:10:07.512,000 --> 0:10:1,000
like quitting a job or jumping out of an airplane

194
0:10:11.603,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and, in the case of my sister,

195
0:10:13.618,000 --> 0:10:16,000
saying "yes" to several therapy sessions,

196
0:10:17.723,000 --> 0:10:2,000
during which we got down to the marrow.

197
0:10:23.588,000 --> 0:10:27,000
We looked at and released years of stories

198
0:10:28.005,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and assumptions about each other

199
0:10:30.11,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and blame and shame

200
0:10:32.212,000 --> 0:10:35,000
until all that was left was love.

201
0:10:38.175,000 --> 0:10:42,000
People have said I was brave to undergo the bone marrow harvest,

202
0:10:42.387,000 --> 0:10:43,000
but I don't think so.

203
0:10:44.1,000 --> 0:10:46,000
What felt brave to me

204
0:10:46.214,000 --> 0:10:49,000
was that other kind of harvest and transplant,

205
0:10:49.423,000 --> 0:10:5,000
the soul marrow transplant,

206
0:10:51.772,000 --> 0:10:54,000
getting emotionally naked with another human being,

207
0:10:55.774,000 --> 0:10:58,000
putting aside pride and defensiveness,

208
0:10:59.267,000 --> 0:11:,000
lifting the layers

209
0:11:01.559,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and sharing with each other our vulnerable souls.

210
0:11:06.416,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I called on those midwife lessons:

211
0:11:09.239,000 --> 0:11:1,000
uncover your soul.

212
0:11:11.963,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Open to what's scary and painful.

213
0:11:14.628,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Look for the sacred awe.

214
0:11:17.872,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Here I am with my marrow cells after the harvest.

215
0:11:21.161,000 --> 0:11:22,000
That's they call it -- "harvest,"

216
0:11:23.085,000 --> 0:11:26,000
like it's some kind of bucolic farm-to-table event --

217
0:11:26.309,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Laughter)

218
0:11:27.491,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Which I can assure you it is not.

219
0:11:31.522,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And here is my brave, brave sister

220
0:11:34.881,000 --> 0:11:35,000
receiving my cells.

221
0:11:37.768,000 --> 0:11:4,000
After the transplant, we began to spend more and more time together.

222
0:11:42.289,000 --> 0:11:44,000
It was as if we were little girls again.

223
0:11:45.537,000 --> 0:11:47,000
The past and the present merged.

224
0:11:48.529,000 --> 0:11:5,000
We entered deep time.

225
0:11:51.331,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I left the hamster wheel of work and life

226
0:11:55.631,000 --> 0:11:56,000
to join my sister

227
0:11:57.992,000 --> 0:11:58,000
on that lonely island

228
0:12:00.444,000 --> 0:12:01,000
of illness and healing.

229
0:12:02.948,000 --> 0:12:03,000
We spent months together --

230
0:12:04.815,000 --> 0:12:05,000
in the isolation unit,

231
0:12:06.601,000 --> 0:12:08,000
in the hospital and in her home.

232
0:12:10.411,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Our fast-paced society

233
0:12:12.124,000 --> 0:12:17,000
does not support or even value this kind of work.

234
0:12:17.308,000 --> 0:12:2,000
We see it as a disruption of real life and important work.

235
0:12:21.426,000 --> 0:12:25,000
We worry about the emotional drain and the financial cost --

236
0:12:25.678,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and, yes, there is a financial cost.

237
0:12:29.277,000 --> 0:12:3,000
But I was paid

238
0:12:31.59,000 --> 0:12:35,000
in the kind of currency our culture seems to have forgotten all about.

239
0:12:37.132,000 --> 0:12:39,000
I was paid in love.

240
0:12:39.629,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I was paid in soul.

241
0:12:41.398,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I was paid in my sister.

242
0:12:44.792,000 --> 0:12:49,000
My sister said the year after transplant was the best year of her life,

243
0:12:50.008,000 --> 0:12:51,000
which was surprising.

244
0:12:51.281,000 --> 0:12:53,000
She suffered so much.

245
0:12:54.364,000 --> 0:12:57,000
But she said life never tasted as sweet,

246
0:12:58.004,000 --> 0:13:,000
and that because of the soul-baring

247
0:13:00.772,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and the truth-telling we had done with each other,

248
0:13:03.721,000 --> 0:13:06,000
she became more unapologetically herself

249
0:13:07.561,000 --> 0:13:08,000
with everyone.

250
0:13:08.976,000 --> 0:13:1,000
She said things she'd always needed to say.

251
0:13:11.968,000 --> 0:13:13,000
She did things she always wanted to do.

252
0:13:15.263,000 --> 0:13:16,000
The same happened for me.

253
0:13:17.246,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I became braver about being authentic with the people in my life.

254
0:13:23.917,000 --> 0:13:24,000
I said my truths,

255
0:13:25.634,000 --> 0:13:29,000
but more important than that, I sought the truth of others.

256
0:13:31.713,000 --> 0:13:34,000
It wasn't until the final chapter of this story

257
0:13:35.121,000 --> 0:13:38,000
that I realized just how well midwifery had trained me.

258
0:13:39.214,000 --> 0:13:41,000
After that best year of my sister's life,

259
0:13:42.153,000 --> 0:13:44,000
the cancer came roaring back,

260
0:13:44.702,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and this time there was nothing more the doctors could do.

261
0:13:47.998,000 --> 0:13:49,000
They gave her just a couple of months to live.

262
0:13:52.196,000 --> 0:13:54,000
The night before my sister died,

263
0:13:55.163,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I sat by her bedside.

264
0:13:57.895,000 --> 0:13:59,000
She was so small and thin.

265
0:14:00.766,000 --> 0:14:02,000
I could see the blood pulsing in her neck.

266
0:14:03.869,000 --> 0:14:06,000
It was my blood, her blood, our blood.

267
0:14:08.462,000 --> 0:14:1,000
When she died, part of me would die, too.

268
0:14:12.687,000 --> 0:14:16,000
I tried to make sense of it all,

269
0:14:17.383,000 --> 0:14:19,000
how becoming one with each other

270
0:14:20.008,000 --> 0:14:22,000
had made us more ourselves,

271
0:14:22.041,000 --> 0:14:23,000
our soul selves,

272
0:14:24.249,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and how by facing and opening to the pain of our past,

273
0:14:29.466,000 --> 0:14:31,000
we'd finally been delivered to each other,

274
0:14:32.651,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and how by stepping out of time,

275
0:14:34.925,000 --> 0:14:36,000
we would now be connected forever.

276
0:14:38.98,000 --> 0:14:4,000
My sister left me with so many things,

277
0:14:42.365,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and I'm going to leave you now with just one of them.

278
0:14:45.565,000 --> 0:14:49,000
You don't have to wait for a life-or-death situation

279
0:14:50.497,000 --> 0:14:53,000
to clean up the relationships that matter to you,

280
0:14:53.64,000 --> 0:14:55,000
to offer the marrow of your soul

281
0:14:57.157,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and to seek it in another.

282
0:15:00.297,000 --> 0:15:01,000
We can all do this.

283
0:15:02.239,000 --> 0:15:06,000
We can be like a new kind of first responder,

284
0:15:07.106,000 --> 0:15:11,000
like the one to take the first courageous step

285
0:15:11.906,000 --> 0:15:12,000
toward the other,

286
0:15:13.682,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and to do something or try to do something

287
0:15:16.951,000 --> 0:15:19,000
other than rejection or attack.

288
0:15:20.545,000 --> 0:15:22,000
We can do this with our siblings

289
0:15:22.735,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and our mates

290
0:15:24.161,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and our friends and our colleagues.

291
0:15:26.441,000 --> 0:15:28,000
We can do this with the disconnection

292
0:15:29.093,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and the discord all around us.

293
0:15:32.41,000 --> 0:15:35,000
We can do this for the soul of the world.

294
0:15:36.629,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Thank you.

295
0:15:37.844,000 --> 0:15:42,000
(Applause)

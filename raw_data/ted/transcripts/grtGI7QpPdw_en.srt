1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I am going to talk about myself,

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
which I rarely do, because I --

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
well for one thing, I prefer to talk about things I know nothing about.

4
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And secondly, I'm a recovering narcissist.

5
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I didn't know I was a narcissist actually.

7
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I thought narcissism meant you loved yourself.

8
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And then someone told me there is a flip side to it.

9
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So it's actually drearier than self-love;

10
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
it's unrequited self-love.

11
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I don't feel I can afford a relapse.

13
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But I want to, though, explain

14
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
how I came to design my own particular brand of comedy

15
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
because I've been through so many different forms of it.

16
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I started with improvisation,

17
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
in a particular form of improvisation called theater games,

18
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
which had one rule,

19
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
which I always thought was a great rule for an ethic for a society.

20
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And the rule was, you couldn't deny the other person's reality,

21
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
you could only build on it.

22
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And of course we live in a society that's all about

23
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
contradicting other peoples' reality.

24
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It's all about contradiction,

25
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
which I think is why I'm so sensitive to contradiction in general.

26
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I see it everywhere.

27
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Like polls. You know, it's always curious to me

28
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that in public opinion polls

29
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the percentage of Americans who don't know the answer to any given question

30
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is always two percent.

31
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
75 percent of Americans

32
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
think Alaska is part of Canada.

33
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But only two percent don't know the effect

34
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that the debacle in Argentina will have on the IMF's monetary policy --

35
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
seems a contradiction.

37
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Or this ad that I read in the New York Times:

38
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
"Wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society.

39
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Buying it from us screams good taste."

40
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Or this that I found in a magazine called California Lawyer,

42
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
in an article that is surely meant for the lawyers at Enron.

43
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
"Surviving the Slammer: Do's and Don'ts."

44
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
"Don't use big words."

46
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
"Learn the lingua franca."

48
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Yeah. "Lingua this, Frankie."

50
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And I suppose it's a contradiction that I

52
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
talk about science when I don't know math.

53
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
You know, because -- and by the way to I was so grateful to Dean Kamen

54
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
for pointing out that one of the reasons,

55
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that there are cultural reasons

56
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that women and minorities don't enter the fields of science and technology --

57
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
because for instance, the reason I don't do math is,

58
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I was taught to do math and read at the same time.

59
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So you're six years old, you're reading Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,

60
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and it becomes rapidly obvious

61
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that there are only two kinds of men in the world:

62
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
dwarves and Prince Charmings.

63
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince.

64
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
That's why little girls don't do math. It's too depressing.

66
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Of course, by talking about science

68
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I also may, as I did the other night,

69
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
incur the violent wrath of some scientists

70
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
who were very upset with me.

71
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I used the word postmodern as if it were OK.

72
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And they got very upset.

73
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
One of them, to his credit, I think really just wanted to engage me

74
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
in a serious argument.

75
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But I don't engage in serious arguments.

76
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I don't approve of them

77
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
because arguments, of course, are all about contradiction,

78
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and they're shaped by the values that I have questions with.

79
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I have questions with the values of Newtonian science,

80
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
like rationality. You're supposed to be rational in an argument.

81
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Well rationality is constructed

82
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
by what Christie Hefner was talking about today,

83
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that mind-body split, you know?

84
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
The head is good, body bad.

85
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Head is ego, body id.

86
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
When we say "I," -- as when Rene Descartes said,

87
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
"I think therefore I am," --

88
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
we mean the head.

89
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And as David Lee Roth sang in "Just a Gigolo,"

90
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
"I ain't got no body."

91
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
That's how you get rationality.

92
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And that's why so much of humor

93
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
is the body asserting itself against the head.

94
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
That's why you have toilet humor and sexual humor.

95
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
That's why you have the Raspyni Brothers

96
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
whacking Richard in the genital area.

97
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And we're laughing doubly then

98
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
because he's the body, but it's also --

99
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Voice offstage: Richard.

100
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Emily Levine: Richard. What did I say?

101
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

102
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Richard. Yes but it's also the head,

103
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
the head of the conference.

104
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
That's the other way that humor --

105
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
like Art Buchwald takes shots at the heads of state.

106
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
It doesn't make quite as much money as body humor I'm sure --

107
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
but nevertheless, what makes us treasure you and adore you.

109
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
There's also a contradiction in rationality in this country though,

110
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
which is, as much as we revere the head,

111
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
we are very anti-intellectual.

112
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I know this because I read in the New York Times,

113
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
the Ayn Rand foundation took out a full-page ad

114
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
after September 11,

115
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in which they said, "The problem is not Iraq or Iran,

116
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
the problem in this country, facing this country

117
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
is the university professors and their spawn."

118
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

119
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So I went back and re-read "The Fountainhead."

120
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Laughter)

121
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I don't know how many of you have read it.

122
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And I'm not an expert on sadomasochism.

123
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
(Laughter)

124
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
But let me just read you a couple of random passages from page 217.

125
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
"The act of a master

126
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
taking painful contemptuous possession of her,

127
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
was the kind of rapture she wanted.

128
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
When they lay together in bed it was,

129
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
as it had to be, as the nature of the act demanded,

130
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
an act of violence.

131
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It was an act of clenched teeth and hatred. It was the unendurable.

132
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Not a caress, but a wave of pain.

133
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
The agony as an act of passion."

134
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So you can imagine my surprise

135
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
on reading in The New Yorker

136
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve,

137
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
claims Ayn Rand as his intellectual mentor.

138
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
It's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix.

140
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
(Laughter)

141
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Bad enough we had to see J. Edgar Hoover in a dress.

142
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Now we have to picture Alan Greenspan

143
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
in a black leather corset, with a butt tattoo that says,

144
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
"Whip inflation now."

145
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
(Laughter)

146
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And Ayn Rand of course, Ayn Rand

147
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
is famous for a philosophy called Objectivism,

148
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
which reflects another value of Newtonian physics,

149
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
which is objectivity.

150
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Objectivity basically is constructed

151
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
in that same S&M way.

152
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It's the subject subjugating the object.

153
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
That's how you assert yourself.

154
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
You make yourself the active voice.

155
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And the object is the passive no-voice.

156
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I was so fascinated by that Oxygen commercial.

157
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I don't know if you know this but --

158
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
maybe it's different now, or maybe you were making a statement --

159
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
but in many hospital nurseries across the country,

160
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
until very recently anyway, according to a book by Jessica Benjamin,

161
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
the signs over the little boys cribs read,

162
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
"I'm a boy,"

163
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and the signs over the little girls cribs read,

164
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
"It's a girl." Yeah.

165
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So the passivity was culturally

166
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
projected onto the little girls.

167
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And this still goes on as I think I told you last year.

168
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
There's a poll that proves --

169
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
there was a poll that was given by Time magazine,

170
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
in which only men were asked, "Have you ever had sex

171
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
with a woman you actively disliked?"

172
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And well, yeah.

173
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Well, 58 percent said yes,

174
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
which I think is overinflated though

175
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
because so many men if you just say,

176
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
"Have you ever had sex ... " "Yes!"

177
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
They don't even wait for the rest of it.

178
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Laughter)

179
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had --

180
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
(Laughter)

181
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
That's the first callback,

182
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
of my attempted quadruple.

183
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
(Laughter)

184
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
So this subject-object thing,

185
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
is part of something I'm very interested in

186
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
because this is why, frankly, I believe in political correctness.

187
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I do. I think it can go too far.

188
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I think Ringling Brothers may have gone too far

189
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
with an ad they took out in the New York Times Magazine.

190
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
"We have a lifelong emotional and financial

191
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
commitment to our Asian Elephant partners."

192
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
(Laughter)

193
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Maybe too far. But you know --

194
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I don't think that

195
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
a person of color making fun of white people

196
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color.

197
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Or women making fun of men is the same as men making fun of women.

198
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Or poor people making fun of rich people, the same as rich people.

199
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I think you can make fun of the have but not the have-nots,

200
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
which is why you don't see me making fun of

201
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Kenneth Lay and his charming wife.

202
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
(Laughter)

203
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
What's funny about being down to four houses?

204
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Laughter)

205
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And I really learned this lesson

206
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
during the sex scandals of the Clinton administration or,

207
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Or as I call them, the good ol' days.

208
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
(Laughter)

209
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
When people I knew, you know, people who considered themselves liberal,

210
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and everything else,

211
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
were making fun of Jennifer Flowers and Paula Jones.

212
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Basically, they were making fun of them for being

213
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
trailer trash or white trash.

214
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It seems, I suppose, a harmless prejudice

215
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and that you're not really hurting anybody.

216
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Until you read, as I did, an ad in the Los Angeles Times.

217
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
"For sale: White trash compactor."

218
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Laughter)

219
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So this whole subject-object thing

220
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
has relevance to humor in this way.

221
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I read a book by a woman named Amy Richlin,

222
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
who is the chair of the Classics department at USC.

223
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And the book is called "The Garden of Priapus."

224
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And she says that Roman humor

225
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
mirrors the construction of Roman society.

226
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
So that Roman society was very top/bottom,

227
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
as ours is to some degree.

228
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And so was humor.

229
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
There always had to be the butt of a joke.

230
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
So it was always the satirist,

231
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
like Juvenal or Martial,

232
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
represented the audience,

233
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and he was going to make fun of the outsider,

234
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
the person who didn't share that subject status.

235
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And in stand-up of course,

236
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
the stand-up comedian is supposed to dominate the audience.

237
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
A lot of heckling is the tension

238
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
of trying to make sure that the

239
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
comedian is going to be able to dominate,

240
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and overcome the heckler.

241
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And I got good at that when I was in stand up.

242
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
But I always hated it because they were

243
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
dictating the terms of the interaction,

244
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
in the same way that engaging in a serious argument

245
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
determines the content, to some degree,

246
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
of what you're talking about.

247
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And I was looking for a form

248
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that didn't have that.

249
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And so I wanted something that was more interactive.

250
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
I know that word is so debased now

251
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
by the use of it by Internet marketers.

252
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I really miss the old telemarketers now, I'll tell you that.

253
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
(Laughter)

254
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
I do, because at least there you stood a chance. You know?

255
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I used to actually hang up on them.

256
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
But then I read in "Dear Abby" that that was rude.

257
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
So the next time that one called

258
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I let him get halfway through his spiel and then I said,

259
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
"You sound sexy."

260
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
(Laughter)

261
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
He hung up on me!

262
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Laughter)

263
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
But the interactivity allows the audience

264
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
to shape what you're going to do as much as

265
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
you shape their experience of the world.

266
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And that's really what I'm looking for.

267
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And I was sort of, as I was starting to analyze

268
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
what exactly it is that I do,

269
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I read a book called "Trickster Makes This World," by Lewis Hyde.

270
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And it was like being psychoanalyzed.

271
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
I mean he had laid it all out.

272
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And then coming to this conference,

273
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I realized that most everybody here

274
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
shared those same qualities

275
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
because really what trickster is

276
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
is an agent of change.

277
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Trickster is a change agent.

278
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And the qualities that I'm about to describe

279
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
are the qualities that make it possible

280
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
to make change happen.

281
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And one of these is boundary crossing.

282
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
I think this is what so, in fact, infuriated the scientists.

283
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
But I like to cross boundaries.

284
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
I like to, as I said, talk about things I know nothing about.

285
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
(Phone Ringing)

286
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
I hope that's my agent,

287
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
because you aren't paying me anything.

288
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
(Laughter)

289
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And I think it's good to talk about things I know nothing about

290
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
because I bring a fresh viewpoint to it, you know?

291
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
I'm able to see the contradiction

292
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
that you may not be able to see.

293
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Like for instance a mime once --

294
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
or a meme as he called himself.

295
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
He was a very selfish meme.

296
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And he said that I had to show more respect

297
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
because it took up to 18 years

298
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
to learn how to do mime properly.

299
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And I said, "Well, that's how you know only stupid people go into it."

300
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
(Laughter)

301
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
It only takes two years to learn how to talk.

302
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
(Laughter)

303
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
(Applause)

304
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And you know people, this is the problem with

305
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
quote, objectivity, unquote.

306
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
When you're only surrounded by people

307
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
who speak the same vocabulary as you,

308
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
or share the same set of assumptions as you,

309
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
you start to think that that's reality.

310
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Like economists, you know, their definition of rational,

311
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
that we all act out of our own economic self-interest.

312
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Well, look at Michael Hawley,

313
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
or look at Dean Kamen,

314
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
or look at my grandmother.

315
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
My grandmother always acted in other people's interests,

316
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
whether they wanted her to or not.

317
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
(Laughter)

318
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
If they had had an Olympics in martyrdom,

319
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
my grandmother would have lost on purpose.

320
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
(Laughter)

321
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
"No, you take the prize.

322
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
You're young. I'm old. Who's going to see it?

323
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Where am I going? I'm going to die soon."

324
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
(Laughter)

325
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
So that's one -- this boundary crossing,

326
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
this go-between which --

327
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Fritz Lanting, is that his name,

328
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
actually said that he was a go-between.

329
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
That's an actual quality of the trickster.

330
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And another is, non-oppositional strategies.

331
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And this is instead of contradiction.

332
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Where you deny the other person's reality,

333
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
you have paradox

334
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
where you allow more than one reality to coexist,

335
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
I think there's another philosophical construction.

336
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
I'm not sure what it's called.

337
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
But my example of it is a sign that I saw in a jewelry store.

338
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
It said, "Ears pierced while you wait."

339
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
(Laughter)

340
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
There the alternative just boggles the imagination.

341
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
(Laughter)

342
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
"Oh no. Thanks though, I'll leave them here. Thanks very much.

343
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
I have some errands to run. So I'll be back to pick them up

344
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
around five, if that's OK with you.

345
0:16:48.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Huh? Huh? What? Can't hear you."

346
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
(Laughter)

347
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
And another attribute of the trickster

348
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:01,000
is smart luck.

349
0:17:01.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
That accidents, that Louis Kahn, who talked about accidents,

350
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
this is another quality of the trickster.

351
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
The trickster has a mind that is prepared for the unprepared.

352
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
That, and I will say this to the scientists,

353
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
that the trickster has the ability to hold

354
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
his ideas lightly

355
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
so that he can let room in for new ideas

356
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
or to see the contradictions or the hidden problems

357
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
with his ideas.

358
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:33,000
I had no joke for that.

359
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
I just wanted to put the scientists in their place.

360
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
(Laughter)

361
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
But here's how I think I like to make change,

362
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
and that is in making connections.

363
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:49,000
This is what I tend to see

364
0:17:49.16,000 --> 0:17:51,000
almost more than contradictions.

365
0:17:51.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
Like the, what do you call those toes of the gecko?

366
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
You know, the toes of the gecko,

367
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
curling and uncurling like the fingers of Michael Moschen.

368
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
I love connections.

369
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:05,000
Like I'll read that one of the two attributes

370
0:18:05.16,000 --> 0:18:08,000
of matter in the Newtonian universe --

371
0:18:08.16,000 --> 0:18:11,000
there are two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe --

372
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:14,000
one is space occupancy. Matter takes up space.

373
0:18:14.16,000 --> 0:18:17,000
I guess the more you matter the more space you take up,

374
0:18:17.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
which explains the whole SUV phenomenon.

375
0:18:19.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
(Laughter)

376
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:25,000
And the other one though is impenetrability.

377
0:18:25.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
Well, in ancient Rome, impenetrability

378
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:31,000
was the criterion of masculinity.

379
0:18:31.16,000 --> 0:18:33,000
Masculinity depended on you

380
0:18:33.16,000 --> 0:18:36,000
being the active penetrator.

381
0:18:36.16,000 --> 0:18:4,000
And then, in economics, there's an active producer

382
0:18:40.16,000 --> 0:18:42,000
and a passive consumer,

383
0:18:42.16,000 --> 0:18:44,000
which explains why business always has to

384
0:18:44.16,000 --> 0:18:47,000
penetrate new markets.

385
0:18:47.16,000 --> 0:18:49,000
Well yeah, I mean why we forced China

386
0:18:49.16,000 --> 0:18:52,000
to open her markets.

387
0:18:52.16,000 --> 0:18:54,000
And didn't that feel good?

388
0:18:54.16,000 --> 0:18:57,000
(Laughter)

389
0:18:57.16,000 --> 0:18:59,000
And now we're being penetrated.

390
0:18:59.16,000 --> 0:19:02,000
You know the biotech companies are actually going inside us

391
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:05,000
and planting their little flags on our genes.

392
0:19:05.16,000 --> 0:19:07,000
You know we're being penetrated.

393
0:19:07.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
And I suspect, by someone who actively dislikes us.

394
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:14,000
(Laughter)

395
0:19:14.16,000 --> 0:19:17,000
That's the second of the quadruple.

396
0:19:17.16,000 --> 0:19:19,000
Yes of course you got that. Thank you very much.

397
0:19:19.16,000 --> 0:19:21,000
I still have a way to go.

398
0:19:21.16,000 --> 0:19:25,000
(Laughter)

399
0:19:25.16,000 --> 0:19:28,000
And what I hope to do, when I make these connections,

400
0:19:28.16,000 --> 0:19:32,000
is short circuit people's thinking.

401
0:19:32.16,000 --> 0:19:35,000
You know, make you not follow your usual

402
0:19:35.16,000 --> 0:19:37,000
train of association,

403
0:19:37.16,000 --> 0:19:4,000
but make you rewire.

404
0:19:40.16,000 --> 0:19:43,000
It literally -- when people say about the shock of recognition,

405
0:19:43.16,000 --> 0:19:53,000
it's literally re-cognition, rewiring how you think --

406
0:19:53.16,000 --> 0:19:56,000
I had a joke to go with this and I forgot it.

407
0:19:56.16,000 --> 0:19:59,000
I'm so sorry. I'm getting like

408
0:19:59.16,000 --> 0:20:01,000
the woman in that joke about --

409
0:20:01.16,000 --> 0:20:04,000
have you heard this joke about the woman driving with her mother?

410
0:20:04.16,000 --> 0:20:06,000
And the mother is elderly.

411
0:20:06.16,000 --> 0:20:08,000
And the mother goes right through a red light.

412
0:20:08.16,000 --> 0:20:11,000
And the daughter doesn't want to say anything.

413
0:20:11.16,000 --> 0:20:14,000
She doesn't want to be like, "You're too old to drive."

414
0:20:14.16,000 --> 0:20:17,000
And the mother goes through a second red light.

415
0:20:17.16,000 --> 0:20:2,000
And the daughter says, as tactfully as possible,

416
0:20:20.16,000 --> 0:20:24,000
"Mom, are you aware that you just went through two red lights?"

417
0:20:24.16,000 --> 0:20:27,000
And the mother says, "Oh! Am I driving?"

418
0:20:27.16,000 --> 0:20:33,000
(Laughter)

419
0:20:33.16,000 --> 0:20:35,000
And that's the shock of recognition

420
0:20:35.16,000 --> 0:20:37,000
at the shock of recognition.

421
0:20:37.16,000 --> 0:20:4,000
That completes the quadruple.

422
0:20:40.16,000 --> 0:20:42,000
(Laughter)

423
0:20:42.16,000 --> 0:20:46,000
I just want to say two more things.

424
0:20:46.16,000 --> 0:20:5,000
One is, another characteristic of trickster

425
0:20:50.16,000 --> 0:20:52,000
is that the trickster has to

426
0:20:52.16,000 --> 0:20:54,000
walk this fine line.

427
0:20:54.16,000 --> 0:20:56,000
He has to have poise.

428
0:20:56.16,000 --> 0:20:59,000
And you know the biggest hurdle for me,

429
0:20:59.16,000 --> 0:21:01,000
in doing what I do,

430
0:21:01.16,000 --> 0:21:03,000
is constructing my performance

431
0:21:03.16,000 --> 0:21:06,000
so that it's prepared and unprepared.

432
0:21:06.16,000 --> 0:21:09,000
Finding the balance between those things

433
0:21:09.16,000 --> 0:21:11,000
is always dangerous

434
0:21:11.16,000 --> 0:21:14,000
because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared.

435
0:21:14.16,000 --> 0:21:17,000
But being too prepared doesn't leave room

436
0:21:17.16,000 --> 0:21:19,000
for the accidents to happen.

437
0:21:19.16,000 --> 0:21:24,000
I was thinking about what Moshe Safdie

438
0:21:24.16,000 --> 0:21:26,000
said yesterday about beauty

439
0:21:26.16,000 --> 0:21:3,000
because in his book, Hyde says that

440
0:21:30.16,000 --> 0:21:35,000
sometimes trickster can tip over into beauty.

441
0:21:35.16,000 --> 0:21:38,000
But to do that you have to

442
0:21:38.16,000 --> 0:21:4,000
lose all the other qualities

443
0:21:40.16,000 --> 0:21:42,000
because once you're into beauty

444
0:21:42.16,000 --> 0:21:44,000
you're into a finished thing.

445
0:21:44.16,000 --> 0:21:46,000
You're into something that

446
0:21:46.16,000 --> 0:21:48,000
occupies space and inhabits time.

447
0:21:48.16,000 --> 0:21:5,000
It's an actual thing.

448
0:21:50.16,000 --> 0:21:55,000
And it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty.

449
0:21:55.16,000 --> 0:21:57,000
But if you don't do that,

450
0:21:57.16,000 --> 0:22:01,000
if you allow for the accident to keep on happening,

451
0:22:01.16,000 --> 0:22:04,000
you have the possibility of getting on a wavelength.

452
0:22:04.16,000 --> 0:22:11,000
I like to think of what I do as a probability wave.

453
0:22:11.16,000 --> 0:22:13,000
When you go into beauty the probability wave

454
0:22:13.16,000 --> 0:22:16,000
collapses into one possibility.

455
0:22:16.16,000 --> 0:22:19,000
And I like to explore all the possibilities

456
0:22:19.16,000 --> 0:22:24,000
in the hope that you'll be on the wavelength of your audience.

457
0:22:24.16,000 --> 0:22:27,000
And the one final quality I want to say about trickster is

458
0:22:27.16,000 --> 0:22:29,000
that he doesn't have a home.

459
0:22:29.16,000 --> 0:22:31,000
He's always on the road.

460
0:22:31.16,000 --> 0:22:35,000
I want to say to you Richard, in closing,

461
0:22:35.16,000 --> 0:22:41,000
that in TED you've created a home.

462
0:22:41.16,000 --> 0:22:43,000
And thank you for inviting me into it.

463
0:22:43.16,000 --> 0:22:45,000
Thank you very much.

464
0:22:45.16,000 --> 0:22:47,000
(Applause)

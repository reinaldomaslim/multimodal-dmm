2
0:00:13.042,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'd like to introduce you to an interesting person named Ötzi.

3
0:00:18.083,000 --> 0:00:19,000
He lives in Italy

4
0:00:19.625,000 --> 0:00:21,000
at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology

5
0:00:22.125,000 --> 0:00:23,000
because he's a mummy.

6
0:00:24.833,000 --> 0:00:26,000
This is an artist's rendition of what he might have looked like

7
0:00:27.833,000 --> 0:00:28,000
when he was alive 5,300 years ago.

8
0:00:30.481,000 --> 0:00:31,000
You want to see what he looks like today?

9
0:00:32.458,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:33.792,000 --> 0:00:35,000
OK, brace yourselves, gross mummy pic coming at you.

11
0:00:37.833,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So, he's not as handsome as he used to be,

12
0:00:42.333,000 --> 0:00:44,000
but he's actually in great shape for a mummy

13
0:00:45.125,000 --> 0:00:47,000
because he was discovered frozen in ice.

14
0:00:48.417,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Ötzi is the oldest mummy that's been discovered with preserved skin.

15
0:00:52.667,000 --> 0:00:54,000
5,300 years is super old,

16
0:00:54.792,000 --> 0:00:56,000
older than the Egyptian pyramids,

17
0:00:57.083,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and Ötzi's skin is covered in 61 black tattoos,

18
0:01:03.042,000 --> 0:01:05,000
all lines and crosses on parts of his body

19
0:01:05.542,000 --> 0:01:07,000
where he might have experienced pain.

20
0:01:08.417,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So scientists think that they might have been used

21
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to mark sites for some kind of therapy,

22
0:01:12.958,000 --> 0:01:13,000
like acupuncture.

23
0:01:15.375,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So clearly, if the oldest skin we've seen

24
0:01:19.042,000 --> 0:01:2,000
is all tattooed up,

25
0:01:20.708,000 --> 0:01:22,000
tattooing is a very ancient practice.

26
0:01:23.375,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But fast-forward to today and tattoos are everywhere.

27
0:01:27.292,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Almost one in four Americans has a tattoo,

28
0:01:30.167,000 --> 0:01:32,000
it's a multibillion-dollar industry,

29
0:01:32.875,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and whether you love tattoos or hate them,

30
0:01:35.458,000 --> 0:01:37,000
this talk will change the way you think about them.

31
0:01:38.833,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So, why are tattoos so popular?

32
0:01:42.542,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Unlike Ötzi, most of us today use tattoos for some kind of self-expression.

33
0:01:48.333,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Personally, I love tattoos because I love art

34
0:01:51.417,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and there is something so wonderful to me,

35
0:01:53.75,000 --> 0:01:56,000
almost romantic, about the way a tattoo as an art form

36
0:01:57.25,000 --> 0:01:59,000
cannot be commodified.

37
0:01:59.75,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Right? Your tattoo lives and dies with you.

38
0:02:02.292,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It can't be bought or sold or traded,

39
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:07,000
so its only value is really personal to you,

40
0:02:07.292,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and I love that.

41
0:02:09.208,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now, I tend to gravitate towards really colorful tattoos

42
0:02:11.917,000 --> 0:02:12,000
because I'm obsessed with color.

43
0:02:13.667,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I teach a whole course on it at my university.

44
0:02:16.292,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But my very first tattoo was an all-black tattoo

45
0:02:19.458,000 --> 0:02:2,000
like Ötzi's.

46
0:02:21.208,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Yep, I did that clichéd thing that young people do sometimes

47
0:02:24.875,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and I got a tattoo in a language I can't even read.

48
0:02:28.083,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:29.667,000 --> 0:02:31,000
OK, but I was 19 years old,

50
0:02:32.458,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I had just returned from my first trip overseas,

51
0:02:35.583,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I was in Japan in the mountains

52
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:4,000
meditating in Buddhist monasteries,

53
0:02:40.5,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and it was a really meaningful experience to me,

54
0:02:42.792,000 --> 0:02:45,000
so I wanted to commemorate it with this Japanese and Chinese character

55
0:02:46.125,000 --> 0:02:47,000
for "mountain."

56
0:02:48.708,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Now, here's what blows my mind.

57
0:02:51.958,000 --> 0:02:53,000
My 14-year-old tattoo

58
0:02:54.417,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and Ötzi's 5,300-year-old tattoos

59
0:02:57.958,000 --> 0:03:,000
are made of the same exact stuff:

60
0:03:01.042,000 --> 0:03:02,000
soot,

61
0:03:02.625,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that black powdery carbon dust

62
0:03:04.75,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that gets left behind in the fireplace when you burn stuff.

63
0:03:08.375,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And if you zoom way, way in on either my tattoo or Ötzi's tattoos,

64
0:03:12.583,000 --> 0:03:14,000
you'll find that they all look something like this.

65
0:03:16.167,000 --> 0:03:19,000
A tattoo is nothing more than a bunch of tiny pigment particles,

66
0:03:19.75,000 --> 0:03:2,000
soot in this case,

67
0:03:21.5,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that get trapped in the dermis,

68
0:03:23.042,000 --> 0:03:26,000
which is the layer of tissue right underneath the surface of the skin.

69
0:03:26.917,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So in over five thousand years,

70
0:03:29.667,000 --> 0:03:32,000
we've done very little to update tattoo technology,

71
0:03:32.875,000 --> 0:03:34,000
apart from getting access to more colors

72
0:03:35.583,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and slightly more efficient methods of installation.

73
0:03:39.958,000 --> 0:03:41,000
While I'm an artist, I'm also a scientist,

74
0:03:42.958,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and I direct a laboratory that researches nanotechnology,

75
0:03:46.875,000 --> 0:03:5,000
which is the science of building things with ultratiny building blocks,

76
0:03:51.167,000 --> 0:03:54,000
thousands of times smaller even than the width of a human hair.

77
0:03:54.833,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And I began to ask myself,

78
0:03:56.667,000 --> 0:03:58,000
how could nanotechnology serve tattooing?

79
0:04:00.125,000 --> 0:04:03,000
If tattoos are just a bunch of particles in the skin,

80
0:04:03.417,000 --> 0:04:07,000
could we swap those particles out for ones that do something more interesting?

81
0:04:08.542,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Here's my big idea:

82
0:04:10.417,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I believe that tattoos can give you superpowers.

83
0:04:13.208,000 --> 0:04:14,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:14.875,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Now, I don't mean they're going to make us fly,

85
0:04:17.125,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but I do think that we can have superpowers

86
0:04:19.417,000 --> 0:04:22,000
in the sense that tattoos can give us new abilities

87
0:04:23.25,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that we don't currently possess.

88
0:04:26.167,000 --> 0:04:29,000
By upgrading the particles, we can engineer tattooing

89
0:04:29.958,000 --> 0:04:32,000
so that it will change not only the appearance of our skin,

90
0:04:33.166,000 --> 0:04:34,000
but also the function of our skin.

91
0:04:36.083,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Let me show you.

92
0:04:37.667,000 --> 0:04:39,000
This is a diagram of a microcapsule.

93
0:04:41.083,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It's a tiny hollow particle with a protective outer shell,

94
0:04:44.208,000 --> 0:04:46,000
about the size of a tattoo pigment,

95
0:04:46.292,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and you can fill the inside with practically whatever you want.

96
0:04:50.417,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So what if we put interesting materials inside of these microcapsules

97
0:04:54.708,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and made tattoo inks with them?

98
0:04:57.083,000 --> 0:04:59,000
What sorts of things could we make a tattoo do?

99
0:05:00.458,000 --> 0:05:02,000
What problems could we solve?

100
0:05:02.708,000 --> 0:05:04,000
What human limitations could we overcome?

101
0:05:06.208,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Well, here's one idea:

102
0:05:08.875,000 --> 0:05:09,000
one of our weaknesses as humans

103
0:05:10.5,000 --> 0:05:13,000
is that we can't see ultraviolet, or UV, light.

104
0:05:14.5,000 --> 0:05:15,000
That's the high-energy part of sunlight

105
0:05:16.417,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that causes sunburn and increases our risk of skin cancer.

106
0:05:20.875,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Many animals and insects can actually see UV light, but we can't.

107
0:05:25.292,000 --> 0:05:28,000
If we could, we'd be able to see sunscreen when it was applied on our skin.

108
0:05:30.208,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Unfortunately, most of us don't wear sunscreen,

109
0:05:33.417,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and those of us who do

110
0:05:35.042,000 --> 0:05:38,000
can't really tell when it wears off, because it's invisible.

111
0:05:38.375,000 --> 0:05:4,000
It's the main reason we treat over five million cases

112
0:05:41.042,000 --> 0:05:44,000
of preventable skin cancer every year in the US alone,

113
0:05:44.833,000 --> 0:05:46,000
costing our economy over five billion dollars annually.

114
0:05:49.167,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So how could we overcome this human weakness with a tattoo?

115
0:05:53.375,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Well, if the problem is that we can't see UV rays,

116
0:05:57.542,000 --> 0:06:,000
maybe we can make a tattoo detect them for us.

117
0:06:00.583,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So I thought, why don't we take some microcapsules,

118
0:06:04.167,000 --> 0:06:07,000
load it up with a UV-sensitive, color-changing dye,

119
0:06:08.125,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and make a tattoo ink out of that?

120
0:06:11.167,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Now, one of the troubles of being a tattoo technologist

121
0:06:15.542,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is finding willing test subjects.

122
0:06:17.542,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Laughter)

123
0:06:19.083,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And when it came time to test this tattoo ink,

124
0:06:22.583,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I thought it best not to torture my poor graduate students.

125
0:06:26.417,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So I decided to tattoo a couple of spots on my own arm instead.

126
0:06:31.875,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And It actually worked. Check it out!

127
0:06:35.083,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I call these tattoos solar freckles

128
0:06:37.417,000 --> 0:06:39,000
because they're powered by sunshine.

129
0:06:39.917,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And right now, they're invisible,

130
0:06:41.542,000 --> 0:06:44,000
but as soon as I expose them to a UV light, acting as the Sun --

131
0:06:45.208,000 --> 0:06:46,000
there they are, blue spots.

132
0:06:47.542,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Now, I'm not wearing sunscreen in this video,

133
0:06:50.625,000 --> 0:06:53,000
but if I was, those blue spots would not appear,

134
0:06:53.75,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and then when my sunscreen wore off later,

135
0:06:56.083,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the solar freckles would reappear in UV light

136
0:06:58.583,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and I would know that it was time to reapply sunscreen.

137
0:07:01.833,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So these tattoos act as a real-time, naked-eye indicator

138
0:07:05.792,000 --> 0:07:06,000
of your skin's UV exposure.

139
0:07:08.583,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And of course,

140
0:07:09.917,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I think there are lots of really cool, artistic things you could do

141
0:07:14.875,000 --> 0:07:16,000
with a color-changing tattoo like this,

142
0:07:18.292,000 --> 0:07:21,000
but I hope that it will also help us solve a big problem

143
0:07:22.25,000 --> 0:07:24,000
in skin protection.

144
0:07:24.333,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Applause)

145
0:07:32.583,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Let me give you another example.

146
0:07:34.792,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Normal human body temperature is about 97 to 99 degrees Fahrenheit,

147
0:07:39.958,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and if you fall outside of that range,

148
0:07:42.292,000 --> 0:07:45,000
you need to seek medical attention right away.

149
0:07:45.333,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Now, the problem is that humans can't detect our own body temperature

150
0:07:49.083,000 --> 0:07:5,000
without a thermometer.

151
0:07:50.917,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Sure, you could try the old hand-on-the-forehead trick,

152
0:07:53.667,000 --> 0:07:55,000
but there's zero scientific evidence to back that up.

153
0:07:56.208,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Laughter)

154
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:,000
So what if we could create a tattooable thermometer

155
0:08:00.75,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that you could access anytime?

156
0:08:03.333,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Well, remember how the solar freckles used a UV-sensitive dye

157
0:08:07.625,000 --> 0:08:1,000
inside of the microcapsules of the tattoo ink?

158
0:08:10.833,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Well, you could also put heat-sensitive dyes

159
0:08:13.458,000 --> 0:08:14,000
inside of microcapsules

160
0:08:15.25,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and you could make different tattoo inks

161
0:08:17.208,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that change color at different temperatures.

162
0:08:19.583,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Suppose it was 96, 98, and a hundred degrees Fahrenheit.

163
0:08:25.417,000 --> 0:08:27,000
If you place those inks side by side,

164
0:08:27.708,000 --> 0:08:28,000
now you have a temperature scale

165
0:08:29.625,000 --> 0:08:31,000
tuned to the human body.

166
0:08:32.5,000 --> 0:08:36,000
In this video, you can see the different patches of tattoos

167
0:08:37.167,000 --> 0:08:38,000
disappearing sequentially

168
0:08:38.542,000 --> 0:08:4,000
as the pigskin we tested them on

169
0:08:40.75,000 --> 0:08:41,000
is heated up.

170
0:08:42.5,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So if you were to place a tattoo like this

171
0:08:44.542,000 --> 0:08:48,000
in a location that was stable to external temperature fluctuations --

172
0:08:49.332,000 --> 0:08:52,000
maybe inside of the mouth, perhaps on the back of the lip? --

173
0:08:53.5,000 --> 0:08:55,000
then you'd be able to read your body temperature anytime

174
0:08:56.167,000 --> 0:08:58,000
by just glancing at your tattoo in the mirror.

175
0:08:59.042,000 --> 0:09:,000
Amazing, right?

176
0:09:01.75,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Applause)

177
0:09:03.083,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Thank you.

178
0:09:04.417,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Applause)

179
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Another limitation that we have as humans

180
0:09:10.208,000 --> 0:09:13,000
is that our skin doesn't conduct electricity,

181
0:09:13.5,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and that can be a good thing, but not necessarily --

182
0:09:16.583,000 --> 0:09:17,000
(Laughter)

183
0:09:18.208,000 --> 0:09:21,000
if you have an electronic biomedical implant,

184
0:09:22.083,000 --> 0:09:24,000
like a pacemaker for example.

185
0:09:24.333,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Right now, if you have a pacemaker,

186
0:09:26.625,000 --> 0:09:3,000
you need surgery every five or 10 years to replace the battery when it dies.

187
0:09:31.167,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And wouldn't it be nice if, instead,

188
0:09:33.75,000 --> 0:09:36,000
we could simply recharge the battery through a patch of conducting skin?

189
0:09:38.708,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Well, if you were to try to tackle that problem with a tattoo,

190
0:09:41.958,000 --> 0:09:44,000
the first step would be to make a tattoo that conducts electricity.

191
0:09:45.875,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So we've been working on a conducting tattoo ink in my lab.

192
0:09:49.292,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And right now, we're able to increase the conductivity of skin over 300-fold

193
0:09:55.25,000 --> 0:09:56,000
with our conducting tattoo ink.

194
0:09:57.833,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Now, we have a long way to go before we reach the conductivity

195
0:10:00.792,000 --> 0:10:01,000
of something like a copper wire,

196
0:10:02.542,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but we're making progress and I'm really excited about this

197
0:10:05.667,000 --> 0:10:08,000
because I think that it could open up a whole new world of possibility

198
0:10:09.208,000 --> 0:10:1,000
for tattoos.

199
0:10:11.125,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I envision a future where tattoos enable us --

200
0:10:15.083,000 --> 0:10:19,000
tattooable wires and tattooable electronics enable us

201
0:10:19.125,000 --> 0:10:23,000
to merge our technologies with our bodies

202
0:10:23.25,000 --> 0:10:25,000
so that they feel more like extensions of ourselves

203
0:10:25.708,000 --> 0:10:26,000
rather than external devices.

204
0:10:28.958,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So these are a few examples of the new abilities that we can gain

205
0:10:33.125,000 --> 0:10:38,000
by using nanotechnology to upgrade our tattoos,

206
0:10:38.208,000 --> 0:10:4,000
but this really is only the beginning.

207
0:10:40.5,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I believe the sky is the limit for what we can do with high-tech tattoos.

208
0:10:45.708,000 --> 0:10:48,000
In the future, tattoos will not only be beautiful,

209
0:10:49.375,000 --> 0:10:5,000
they'll be functional too.

210
0:10:51.833,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Thank you.

211
0:10:53.333,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Applause)

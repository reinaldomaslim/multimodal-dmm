I love dumplings.

3
0:00:15.246,000 --> 0:00:18,000
But I seldom have dumplings in a restaurant,

4
0:00:18.96,000 --> 0:00:2,000
because my mom's cooking is the best.

5
0:00:22.476,000 --> 0:00:26,000
One day, I happened to take a bite of Dumpling Xi's dish.

6
0:00:26.966,000 --> 0:00:27,000
To my surprise,

7
0:00:28.34,000 --> 0:00:3,000
they had a flavor of going home.

8
0:00:31.458,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Fresh, chewy and unexpected.

9
0:00:35.829,000 --> 0:00:37,000
In addition to being a dumpling lover,

10
0:00:37.972,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I actually have a full-time job.

11
0:00:40.385,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I am a management consultant,

12
0:00:42.464,000 --> 0:00:44,000
so naturally, I was keen to understand

13
0:00:45.263,000 --> 0:00:48,000
the reasons behind those delicious dumplings.

14
0:00:48.914,000 --> 0:00:49,000
What I didn't expect

15
0:00:50.35,000 --> 0:00:53,000
is that this dumpling triggered my exploration

16
0:00:53.461,000 --> 0:00:55,000
of new ways of management in China.

17
0:00:56.327,000 --> 0:01:01,000
A change that is deeply rooted in ancient Chinese philosophies.

18
0:01:01.771,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But first, let's go back to the dumplings.

19

0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I’m going around the world giving talks about Darwin,

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and usually what I’m talking about

3
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
is Darwin’s strange inversion of reasoning.

4
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Now that title, that phrase, comes from a critic, an early critic,

5
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and this is a passage that I just love, and would like to read for you.

6
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
"In the theory with which we have to deal, Absolute Ignorance is the artificer;

7
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system,

8
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that, in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine,

9
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
it is not requisite to know how to make it.

10
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
This proposition will be found on careful examination to express,

11
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
in condensed form, the essential purport of the Theory,

12
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and to express in a few words all Mr. Darwin’s meaning;

13
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
who, by a strange inversion of reasoning,

14
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
seems to think Absolute Ignorance fully qualified

15
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to take the place of Absolute Wisdom in the achievements of creative skill."

16
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Exactly. Exactly. And it is a strange inversion.

17
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
A creationist pamphlet has this wonderful page in it:

18
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
"Test Two:

19
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Do you know of any building that didn’t have a builder? Yes/No.

20
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Do you know of any painting that didn’t have a painter? Yes/No.

21
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Do you know of any car that didn’t have a maker? Yes/No.

22
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
If you answered 'Yes' for any of the above, give details."

23
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
A-ha! I mean, it really is a strange inversion of reasoning.

24
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
You would have thought it stands to reason

25
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that design requires an intelligent designer.

26
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But Darwin shows that it’s just false.

27
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
Today, though, I’m going to talk about Darwin’s other strange inversion,

28
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
which is equally puzzling at first, but in some ways just as important.

29
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet.

30
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Guys go for girls like this because they are sexy.

31
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We adore babies because they’re so cute.

32
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And, of course, we are amused by jokes because they are funny.

33
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
This is all backwards. It is. And Darwin shows us why.

34
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Let’s start with sweet. Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector,

35
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
because sugar is high energy, and it’s just been wired up to the preferer,

36
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to put it very crudely, and that’s why we like sugar.

37
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Honey is sweet because we like it, not "we like it because honey is sweet."

38
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
There’s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey.

39
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind,

40
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
you wouldn’t see why they tasted sweet.

41
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
You have to look in our brains to understand why they’re sweet.

42
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So if you think first there was sweetness,

43
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and then we evolved to like sweetness,

44
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
you’ve got it backwards; that’s just wrong. It’s the other way round.

45
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved.

46
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And there’s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies.

47
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And it’s a good thing that there isn’t, because if there were,

48
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
then Mother Nature would have a problem:

49
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
How on earth do you get chimps to mate?

50
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Now you might think, ah, there’s a solution: hallucinations.

51
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
That would be one way of doing it, but there’s a quicker way.

52
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Just wire the chimps up to love that look,

53
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and apparently they do.

54
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
That’s all there is to it.

55
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Over six million years, we and the chimps evolved our different ways.

56
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We became bald-bodied, oddly enough;

57
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
for one reason or another, they didn’t.

58
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
If we hadn’t, then probably this would be the height of sexiness.

59
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Our sweet tooth is an evolved and instinctual preference for high-energy food.

60
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It wasn’t designed for chocolate cake.

61
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus.

62
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The term is owed to Niko Tinbergen,

63
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
who did his famous experiments with gulls,

64
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
where he found that that orange spot on the gull’s beak --

65
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
if he made a bigger, oranger spot

66
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the gull chicks would peck at it even harder.

67
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It was a hyperstimulus for them, and they loved it.

68
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
What we see with, say, chocolate cake

69
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
is it’s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring.

70
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And there are lots of supernormal stimuli; chocolate cake is one.

71
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
There's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness.

72
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And there's even supernormal stimuli for cuteness. Here’s a pretty good example.

73
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
It’s important that we love babies, and that we not be put off by, say, messy diapers.

74
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing, and they do.

75
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And, by the way, a recent study shows that mothers

76
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby.

77
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So nature works on many levels here.

78
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But now, if babies didn’t look the way they do -- if babies looked like this,

79
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that’s what we would find adorable, that’s what we would find --

80
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
we would think, oh my goodness, do I ever want to hug that.

81
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
This is the strange inversion.

82
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Well now, finally what about funny. My answer is, it’s the same story, the same story.

83
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
This is the hard one, the one that isn’t obvious. That’s why I leave it to the end.

84
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And I won’t be able to say too much about it.

85
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But you have to think evolutionarily, you have to think, what hard job that has to be done --

86
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
it’s dirty work, somebody’s got to do it --

87
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
is so important to give us such a powerful, inbuilt reward for it when we succeed.

88
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Now, I think we've found the answer -- I and a few of my colleagues.

89
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It’s a neural system that’s wired up to reward the brain

90
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
for doing a grubby clerical job.

91
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Our bumper sticker for this view is

92
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that this is the joy of debugging.

93
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Now I’m not going to have time to spell it all out,

94
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
but I’ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward.

95
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And what we’re doing is we’re using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe

96
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
by switching humor on and off, by turning the knob on a joke --

97
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
now it’s not funny ... oh, now it’s funnier ...

98
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
now we’ll turn a little bit more ... now it’s not funny --

99
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
in this way, we can actually learn something

100
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
about the architecture of the brain,

101
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the functional architecture of the brain.

102
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Matthew Hurley is the first author of this. We call it the Hurley Model.

103
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
He’s a computer scientist, Reginald Adams a psychologist, and there I am,

104
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and we’re putting this together into a book.

105
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Thank you very much.

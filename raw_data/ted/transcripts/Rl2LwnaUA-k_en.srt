1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Well, as Chris pointed out, I study the human brain,

2
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:31,000
the functions and structure of the human brain.

3
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails.

4
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Here is this mass of jelly, three-pound mass of jelly

5
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
you can hold in the palm of your hand,

6
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.

7
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It can contemplate the meaning of infinity

8
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity.

9
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness,

10
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:02,000
which I think is the holy grail of neuroscience, of neurology,

11
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and hopefully, someday, we'll understand how that happens.

12
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:08,000
OK, so how do you study this mysterious organ?

13
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I mean, you have 100 billion nerve cells,

14
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:15,000
little wisps of protoplasm, interacting with each other,

15
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities

16
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that we call human nature and human consciousness.

17
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:23,000
How does this happen?

18
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Well, there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain.

19
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
One approach, the one we use mainly,

20
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:34,000
is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain,

21
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
where there's been a genetic change in a small region of the brain.

22
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:4,000
What then happens is not an across-the-board reduction

23
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:42,000
in all your mental capacities,

24
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:45,000
a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability.

25
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:48,000
What you get is a highly selective loss of one function,

26
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
with other functions being preserved intact,

27
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and this gives you some confidence in asserting

28
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function.

29
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So you can then map function onto structure,

30
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and then find out what the circuitry's doing

31
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to generate that particular function.

32
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So that's what we're trying to do.

33
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So let me give you a few striking examples of this.

34
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:12,000
In fact, I'm giving you three examples, six minutes each, during this talk.

35
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome.

36
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
If you look at the first slide there,

37
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that's the temporal lobes, frontal lobes, parietal lobes, OK --

38
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:25,000
the lobes that constitute the brain.

39
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And if you look, tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes --

40
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:31,000
you can't see it there --

41
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.

42
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And that's been called the face area in the brain,

43
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
because when it's damaged, you can no longer recognize people's faces.

44
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:41,000
You can still recognize them from their voice

45
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and say, "Oh yeah, that's Joe,"

46
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but you can't look at their face and know who it is, right?

47
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
You can't even recognize yourself in the mirror.

48
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I mean, you know it's you because you wink and it winks,

49
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and you know it's a mirror,

50
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but you don't really recognize yourself as yourself.

51
0:02:56,000 --> 0:03:,000
OK. Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus.

52
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:03,000
But there's another rare syndrome, so rare, in fact,

53
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that very few physicians have heard about it, not even neurologists.

54
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:09,000
This is called the Capgras delusion,

55
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and that is a patient, who's otherwise completely normal,

56
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:15,000
has had a head injury, comes out of coma,

57
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:18,000
otherwise completely normal, he looks at his mother

58
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and says, "This looks exactly like my mother, this woman,

59
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:23,000
but she's an impostor.

60
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:25,000
She's some other woman pretending to be my mother."

61
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Now, why does this happen?

62
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Why would somebody -- and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent

63
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:32,000
in all other respects, but when he sees his mother,

64
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:35,000
his delusion kicks in and says, it's not mother.

65
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Now, the most common interpretation of this,

66
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:39,000
which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks,

67
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:43,000
is a Freudian view, and that is that this chap --

68
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and the same argument applies to women, by the way,

69
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but I'll just talk about guys.

70
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:5,000
When you're a little baby, a young baby,

71
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother.

72
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
This is the so-called Oedipus complex of Freud.

73
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I'm not saying I believe this,

74
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:58,000
but this is the standard Freudian view.

75
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And then, as you grow up, the cortex develops,

76
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother.

77
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Thank God, or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother.

78
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And then what happens is,

79
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:13,000
there's a blow to your head, damaging the cortex,

80
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:17,000
allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge,

81
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:2,000
flaming to the surface, and suddenly and inexplicably

82
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:23,000
you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother.

83
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And you say, "My God, if this is my mom,

84
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:27,000
how come I'm being sexually turned on?

85
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:29,000
She's some other woman. She's an impostor."

86
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain.

87
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
This has never made much sense to me, this argument.

88
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It's very ingenious, as all Freudian arguments are --

89
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:46,000
-- but didn't make much sense because I have seen the same delusion,

91
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:48,000
a patient having the same delusion, about his pet poodle.

92
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:54,000
He'll say, "Doctor, this is not Fifi. It looks exactly like Fifi,

94
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:56,000
but it's some other dog." Right?

95
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Now, you try using the Freudian explanation there.

96
0:04:58,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:03,000
You'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans,

98
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:06,000
or some such thing, which is quite absurd, of course.

99
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Now, what's really going on?

100
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So, to explain this curious disorder,

101
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:14,000
we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain.

102
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Normally, visual signals come in, into the eyeballs,

103
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:19,000
go to the visual areas in the brain.

104
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:22,000
There are, in fact, 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision,

105
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and after processing all that, the message goes to a small structure

106
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:3,000
called the fusiform gyrus, where you perceive faces.

107
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:32,000
There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces.

108
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:35,000
You can call it the face area of the brain, right?

109
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I talked about that earlier.

110
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Now, when that area's damaged, you lose the ability to see faces, right?

111
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:44,000
But from that area, the message cascades

112
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system,

113
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:49,000
the emotional core of the brain,

114
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and that structure, called the amygdala,

115
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:53,000
gauges the emotional significance of what you're looking at.

116
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Is it prey? Is it predator? Is it mate?

117
0:05:57,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Or is it something absolutely trivial, like a piece of lint,

118
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:03,000
or a piece of chalk, or a -- I don't want to point to that, but --

119
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:05,000
or a shoe, or something like that? OK?

120
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Which you can completely ignore.

121
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So if the amygdala is excited, and this is something important,

122
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:13,000
the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system.

123
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Your heart starts beating faster.

124
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:18,000
You start sweating to dissipate the heat that you're going to

125
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:2,000
create from muscular exertion.

126
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And that's fortunate, because we can put two electrodes on your palm

127
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating.

128
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So I can determine, when you're looking at something,

129
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:34,000
whether you're excited or whether you're aroused, or not, OK?

130
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And I'll get to that in a minute.

131
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So my idea was, when this chap looks at an object, when he looks at his --

132
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:44,000
any object for that matter, it goes to the visual areas and,

133
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:47,000
however, and it's processed in the fusiform gyrus,

134
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and you recognize it as a pea plant, or a table,

135
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:52,000
or your mother, for that matter, OK?

136
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And then the message cascades into the amygdala,

137
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and then goes down the autonomic nervous system.

138
0:06:57,000 --> 0:07:02,000
But maybe, in this chap, that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system,

139
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:05,000
the emotional core of the brain, is cut by the accident.

140
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So because the fusiform is intact,

141
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:1,000
the chap can still recognize his mother,

142
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and says, "Oh yeah, this looks like my mother."

143
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers,

144
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:19,000
he says, "But how come, if it's my mother, I don't experience a warmth?"

145
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Or terror, as the case may be? Right?

146
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Laughter)

147
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And therefore, he says, "How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions?

148
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:3,000
This can't be my mother.

149
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It's some strange woman pretending to be my mother."

150
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:34,000
How do you test this?

151
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Well, what you do is, if you take any one of you here, and put you in front of a screen,

152
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and measure your galvanic skin response,

153
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and show pictures on the screen,

154
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I can measure how you sweat when you see an object,

155
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:47,000
like a table or an umbrella. Of course, you don't sweat.

156
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:52,000
If I show you a picture of a lion, or a tiger, or a pinup, you start sweating, right?

157
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And, believe it or not, if I show you a picture of your mother --

158
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I'm talking about normal people -- you start sweating.

159
0:07:57,000 --> 0:07:59,000
You don't even have to be Jewish.

160
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:01,000
(Laughter)

161
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Now, what happens if you show this patient?

162
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:09,000
You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen

163
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and measure his galvanic skin response.

164
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Tables and chairs and lint, nothing happens, as in normal people,

165
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
but when you show him a picture of his mother,

166
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:2,000
the galvanic skin response is flat.

167
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:22,000
There's no emotional reaction to his mother,

168
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:27,000
because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut.

169
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal,

170
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:33,000
his emotions are normal -- he'll laugh, he'll cry, so on and so forth --

171
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
but the wire from vision to emotions is cut

172
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor.

173
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do:

174
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:46,000
take a bizarre, seemingly incomprehensible, neural psychiatric syndrome

175
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and say that the standard Freudian view is wrong,

176
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that, in fact, you can come up with a precise explanation

177
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:54,000
in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain.

178
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:56,000
By the way, if this patient then goes,

179
0:08:56,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and mother phones from an adjacent room -- phones him --

180
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and he picks up the phone, and he says, "Wow, mom, how are you? Where are you?"

181
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:07,000
There's no delusion through the phone.

182
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Then, she approaches him after an hour, he says, "Who are you?

183
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:11,000
You look just like my mother." OK?

184
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:13,000
The reason is there's a separate pathway

185
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:17,000
going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers,

186
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and that's not been cut by the accident.

187
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:24,000
So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother, no problem.

188
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:27,000
When he sees her in person, he says it's an impostor.

189
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:31,000
OK, how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain?

190
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Is it nature, genes, or is it nurture?

191
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And we approach this problem

192
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:4,000
by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb.

193
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And you all know what a phantom limb is.

194
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:45,000
When an arm is amputated, or a leg is amputated, for gangrene,

195
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:47,000
or you lose it in war -- for example, in the Iraq war,

196
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:49,000
it's now a serious problem --

197
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:53,000
you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm,

198
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and that's called a phantom arm or a phantom leg.

199
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
In fact, you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body.

200
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Believe it or not, even with internal viscera.

201
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I've had patients with the uterus removed -- hysterectomy --

202
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:1,000
who have a phantom uterus, including phantom menstrual cramps

203
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:12,000
at the appropriate time of the month.

204
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And in fact, one student asked me the other day,

205
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
"Do they get phantom PMS?"

206
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
(Laughter)

207
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:21,000
A subject ripe for scientific enquiry, but we haven't pursued that.

208
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:24,000
OK, now the next question is,

209
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:27,000
what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments?

210
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:29,000
One of the things we've found was,

211
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:31,000
about half the patients with phantom limbs

212
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:33,000
claim that they can move the phantom.

213
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It'll pat his brother on the shoulder,

214
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:37,000
it'll answer the phone when it rings, it'll wave goodbye.

215
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:4,000
These are very compelling, vivid sensations.

216
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:42,000
The patient's not delusional.

217
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:44,000
He knows that the arm is not there,

218
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:47,000
but, nevertheless, it's a compelling sensory experience for the patient.

219
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But however, about half the patients, this doesn't happen.

220
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:54,000
The phantom limb -- they'll say, "But doctor, the phantom limb is paralyzed.

221
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:57,000
It's fixed in a clenched spasm and it's excruciatingly painful.

222
0:10:57,000 --> 0:11:,000
If only I could move it, maybe the pain will be relieved."

223
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Now, why would a phantom limb be paralyzed?

224
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:05,000
It sounds like an oxymoron.

225
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But when we were looking at the case sheets, what we found was,

226
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:1,000
these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs,

227
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:14,000
the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury.

228
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:17,000
The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed,

229
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:19,000
was cut, by say, a motorcycle accident.

230
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So the patient had an actual arm, which is painful,

231
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:26,000
in a sling for a few months or a year, and then,

232
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm,

233
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:31,000
the surgeon amputates the arm,

234
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains, right?

235
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And this is a serious clinical problem.

236
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Patients become depressed.

237
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Some of them are driven to suicide, OK?

238
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:43,000
So, how do you treat this syndrome?

239
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Now, why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb?

240
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:49,000
When I looked at the case sheet, I found that they had an actual arm,

241
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut,

242
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and the actual arm had been paralyzed,

243
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation,

244
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself.

245
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Why does this happen?

246
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:09,000
When the arm was intact, but paralyzed,

247
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:12,000
the brain sends commands to the arm, the front of the brain, saying, "Move,"

248
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:14,000
but it's getting visual feedback saying, "No."

249
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Move. No. Move. No. Move. No.

250
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain,

251
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and we call this learned paralysis, OK?

252
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:28,000
The brain learns, because of this Hebbian, associative link,

253
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:31,000
that the mere command to move the arm

254
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:33,000
creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm.

255
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And then, when you've amputated the arm,

256
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:39,000
this learned paralysis carries over into your body image

257
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and into your phantom, OK?

258
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Now, how do you help these patients?

259
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:46,000
How do you unlearn the learned paralysis,

260
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:5,000
so you can relieve him of this excruciating, clenching spasm

261
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:52,000
of the phantom arm?

262
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Well, we said, what if you now send the command to the phantom,

263
0:12:57,000 --> 0:13:01,000
but give him visual feedback that it's obeying his command, right?

264
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain, the phantom cramp.

265
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:06,000
How do you do that? Well, virtual reality.

266
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:08,000
But that costs millions of dollars.

267
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So, I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars,

268
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:13,000
but don't tell my funding agencies.

269
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:14,000
(Laughter)

270
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:18,000
OK? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box.

271
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:2,000
You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle,

272
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and then you put the phantom -- so my first patient, Derek, came in.

273
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:27,000
He had his arm amputated 10 years ago.

274
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:3,000
He had a brachial avulsion, so the nerves were cut

275
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and the arm was paralyzed, lying in a sling for a year, and then the arm was amputated.

276
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:36,000
He had a phantom arm, excruciatingly painful, and he couldn't move it.

277
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
It was a paralyzed phantom arm.

278
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:42,000
So he came there, and I gave him a mirror like that, in a box,

279
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:45,000
which I call a mirror box, right?

280
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And the patient puts his phantom left arm,

281
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:5,000
which is clenched and in spasm, on the left side of the mirror,

282
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror,

283
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and makes the same posture, the clenched posture,

284
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and looks inside the mirror. And what does he experience?

285
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:02,000
He looks at the phantom being resurrected,

286
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:06,000
because he's looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror,

287
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected.

288
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:11,000
"Now," I said, "now, look, wiggle your phantom --

289
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:15,000
your real fingers, or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror."

290
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:19,000
He's going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving, right?

291
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:21,000
That's obvious, but the astonishing thing is,

292
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:24,000
the patient then says, "Oh my God, my phantom is moving again,

293
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and the pain, the clenching spasm, is relieved."

294
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And remember, my first patient who came in --

295
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:3,000
(Applause)

296
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:34,000
-- thank you. (Applause)

297
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:37,000
My first patient came in, and he looked in the mirror,

298
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and I said, "Look at your reflection of your phantom."

299
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And he started giggling, he says, "I can see my phantom."

300
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:44,000
But he's not stupid. He knows it's not real.

301
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:46,000
He knows it's a mirror reflection,

302
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:48,000
but it's a vivid sensory experience.

303
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Now, I said, "Move your normal hand and phantom."

304
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:53,000
He said, "Oh, I can't move my phantom. You know that. It's painful."

305
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I said, "Move your normal hand."

306
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And he says, "Oh my God, my phantom is moving again. I don't believe this!

307
0:14:57,000 --> 0:15:,000
And my pain is being relieved." OK?

308
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And then I said, "Close your eyes."

309
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:03,000
He closes his eyes.

310
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:04,000
"And move your normal hand."

311
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:05,000
"Oh, nothing. It's clenched again."

312
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:07,000
"OK, open your eyes."

313
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:08,000
"Oh my God, oh my God, it's moving again!"

314
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:1,000
So, he was like a kid in a candy store.

315
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:15,000
So, I said, OK, this proves my theory about learned paralysis

316
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and the critical role of visual input,

317
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:19,000
but I'm not going to get a Nobel Prize

318
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:21,000
for getting somebody to move his phantom limb.

319
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:22,000
(Laughter)

320
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:23,000
(Applause)

321
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:26,000
It's a completely useless ability, if you think about it.

322
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
(Laughter)

323
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:31,000
But then I started realizing, maybe other kinds of paralysis

324
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:36,000
that you see in neurology, like stroke, focal dystonias --

325
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:38,000
there may be a learned component to this,

326
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:41,000
which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror.

327
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:43,000
So, I said, "Look, Derek" --

328
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:46,000
well, first of all, the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain --

329
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:5,000
I said, "Look, Derek, take it home and practice with it for a week or two.

330
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Maybe, after a period of practice,

331
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:54,000
you can dispense with the mirror, unlearn the paralysis,

332
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and start moving your paralyzed arm,

333
0:15:56,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and then, relieve yourself of pain."

334
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:,000
So he said OK, and he took it home.

335
0:16:,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I said, "Look, it's, after all, two dollars. Take it home."

336
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:05,000
So, he took it home, and after two weeks, he phones me,

337
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and he said, "Doctor, you're not going to believe this."

338
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:08,000
I said, "What?"

339
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:1,000
He said, "It's gone."

340
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:11,000
I said, "What's gone?"

341
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:13,000
I thought maybe the mirror box was gone.

342
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:14,000
(Laughter)

343
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:17,000
He said, "No, no, no, you know this phantom I've had for the last 10 years?

344
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:19,000
It's disappeared."

345
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And I said -- I got worried, I said, my God,

346
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:23,000
I mean I've changed this guy's body image,

347
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:26,000
what about human subjects, ethics and all of that?

348
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
And I said, "Derek, does this bother you?"

349
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:31,000
He said, "No, last three days, I've not had a phantom arm

350
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and therefore no phantom elbow pain, no clenching,

351
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:37,000
no phantom forearm pain, all those pains are gone away.

352
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:41,000
But the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder,

353
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and your box doesn't reach."

354
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:44,000
(Laughter)

355
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:47,000
"So, can you change the design and put it on my forehead,

356
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:5,000
so I can, you know, do this and eliminate my phantom fingers?"

357
0:16:5,000 --> 0:16:52,000
He thought I was some kind of magician.

358
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Now, why does this happen?

359
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:56,000
It's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict.

360
0:16:56,000 --> 0:16:59,000
It's getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back.

361
0:16:59,000 --> 0:17:01,000
On the other hand, there's no proprioception,

362
0:17:01,000 --> 0:17:05,000
muscle signals saying that there is no arm, right?

363
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:07,000
And your motor command saying there is an arm,

364
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and, because of this conflict, the brain says, to hell with it,

365
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:13,000
there is no phantom, there is no arm, right?

366
0:17:13,000 --> 0:17:15,000
It goes into a sort of denial -- it gates the signals.

367
0:17:15,000 --> 0:17:19,000
And when the arm disappears, the bonus is, the pain disappears

368
0:17:19,000 --> 0:17:23,000
because you can't have disembodied pain floating out there, in space.

369
0:17:23,000 --> 0:17:25,000
So, that's the bonus.

370
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Now, this technique has been tried on dozens of patients

371
0:17:27,000 --> 0:17:29,000
by other groups in Helsinki,

372
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:32,000
so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain,

373
0:17:32,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and indeed, people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation.

374
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers,

375
0:17:37,000 --> 0:17:39,000
nothing you can do about it.

376
0:17:39,000 --> 0:17:44,000
But, it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis,

377
0:17:44,000 --> 0:17:47,000
and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors.

378
0:17:47,000 --> 0:17:49,000
This has also gone through clinical trials,

379
0:17:49,000 --> 0:17:51,000
helping lots and lots of patients.

380
0:17:51,000 --> 0:17:55,000
OK, let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk,

381
0:17:55,000 --> 0:17:59,000
which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia.

382
0:17:59,000 --> 0:18:02,000
This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century.

383
0:18:02,000 --> 0:18:04,000
He was a cousin of Charles Darwin.

384
0:18:04,000 --> 0:18:06,000
He pointed out that certain people in the population,

385
0:18:06,000 --> 0:18:1,000
who are otherwise completely normal, had the following peculiarity:

386
0:18:1,000 --> 0:18:13,000
every time they see a number, it's colored.

387
0:18:13,000 --> 0:18:17,000
Five is blue, seven is yellow, eight is chartreuse,

388
0:18:17,000 --> 0:18:19,000
nine is indigo, OK?

389
0:18:19,000 --> 0:18:22,000
Bear in mind, these people are completely normal in other respects.

390
0:18:22,000 --> 0:18:25,000
Or C sharp -- sometimes, tones evoke color.

391
0:18:25,000 --> 0:18:28,000
C sharp is blue, F sharp is green,

392
0:18:28,000 --> 0:18:31,000
another tone might be yellow, right?

393
0:18:31,000 --> 0:18:33,000
Why does this happen?

394
0:18:33,000 --> 0:18:35,000
This is called synesthesia. Galton called it synesthesia,

395
0:18:35,000 --> 0:18:37,000
a mingling of the senses.

396
0:18:37,000 --> 0:18:39,000
In us, all the senses are distinct.

397
0:18:39,000 --> 0:18:41,000
These people muddle up their senses.

398
0:18:41,000 --> 0:18:42,000
Why does this happen?

399
0:18:42,000 --> 0:18:44,000
One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing.

400
0:18:44,000 --> 0:18:46,000
Synesthesia runs in families,

401
0:18:46,000 --> 0:18:49,000
so Galton said this is a hereditary basis, a genetic basis.

402
0:18:49,000 --> 0:18:53,000
Secondly, synesthesia is about -- and this is what gets me to my point

403
0:18:53,000 --> 0:18:56,000
about the main theme of this lecture, which is about creativity --

404
0:18:56,000 --> 0:19:01,000
synesthesia is eight times more common among artists, poets, novelists

405
0:19:01,000 --> 0:19:04,000
and other creative people than in the general population.

406
0:19:04,000 --> 0:19:05,000
Why would that be?

407
0:19:05,000 --> 0:19:07,000
I'm going to answer that question.

408
0:19:07,000 --> 0:19:09,000
It's never been answered before.

409
0:19:09,000 --> 0:19:1,000
OK, what is synesthesia? What causes it?

410
0:19:1,000 --> 0:19:11,000
Well, there are many theories.

411
0:19:11,000 --> 0:19:13,000
One theory is they're just crazy.

412
0:19:13,000 --> 0:19:16,000
Now, that's not really a scientific theory, so we can forget about it.

413
0:19:16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads, right?

414
0:19:2,000 --> 0:19:22,000
Now, there may be some truth to this,

415
0:19:22,000 --> 0:19:24,000
because it's much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego.

416
0:19:24,000 --> 0:19:25,000
(Laughter)

417
0:19:25,000 --> 0:19:28,000
OK. Now, the third theory is that --

418
0:19:28,000 --> 0:19:33,000
well, let's ask ourselves what's really going on in synesthesia. All right?

419
0:19:33,000 --> 0:19:36,000
So, we found that the color area and the number area

420
0:19:36,000 --> 0:19:39,000
are right next to each other in the brain, in the fusiform gyrus.

421
0:19:39,000 --> 0:19:41,000
So we said, there's some accidental cross wiring

422
0:19:41,000 --> 0:19:44,000
between color and numbers in the brain.

423
0:19:44,000 --> 0:19:47,000
So, every time you see a number, you see a corresponding color,

424
0:19:47,000 --> 0:19:49,000
and that's why you get synesthesia.

425
0:19:49,000 --> 0:19:51,000
Now remember -- why does this happen?

426
0:19:51,000 --> 0:19:53,000
Why would there be crossed wires in some people?

427
0:19:53,000 --> 0:19:55,000
Remember I said it runs in families?

428
0:19:55,000 --> 0:19:57,000
That gives you the clue.

429
0:19:57,000 --> 0:19:59,000
And that is, there is an abnormal gene,

430
0:19:59,000 --> 0:20:02,000
a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring.

431
0:20:02,000 --> 0:20:04,000
In all of us, it turns out

432
0:20:04,000 --> 0:20:08,000
we are born with everything wired to everything else.

433
0:20:08,000 --> 0:20:11,000
So, every brain region is wired to every other region,

434
0:20:11,000 --> 0:20:13,000
and these are trimmed down to create

435
0:20:13,000 --> 0:20:16,000
the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain.

436
0:20:16,000 --> 0:20:18,000
So, if there's a gene causing this trimming

437
0:20:18,000 --> 0:20:2,000
and if that gene mutates,

438
0:20:2,000 --> 0:20:23,000
then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas.

439
0:20:23,000 --> 0:20:26,000
And if it's between number and color, you get number-color synesthesia.

440
0:20:26,000 --> 0:20:29,000
If it's between tone and color, you get tone-color synesthesia.

441
0:20:29,000 --> 0:20:31,000
So far, so good.

442
0:20:31,000 --> 0:20:33,000
Now, what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain,

443
0:20:33,000 --> 0:20:34,000
so everything is cross-connected?

444
0:20:34,000 --> 0:20:4,000
Well, think about what artists, novelists and poets have in common,

445
0:20:4,000 --> 0:20:43,000
the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking,

446
0:20:43,000 --> 0:20:45,000
linking seemingly unrelated ideas,

447
0:20:45,000 --> 0:20:48,000
such as, "It is the east, and Juliet is the Sun."

448
0:20:48,000 --> 0:20:5,000
Well, you don't say, Juliet is the sun,

449
0:20:5,000 --> 0:20:52,000
does that mean she's a glowing ball of fire?

450
0:20:52,000 --> 0:20:55,000
I mean, schizophrenics do that, but it's a different story, right?

451
0:20:55,000 --> 0:20:58,000
Normal people say, she's warm like the sun,

452
0:20:58,000 --> 0:21:,000
she's radiant like the sun, she's nurturing like the sun.

453
0:21:,000 --> 0:21:02,000
Instantly, you've found the links.

454
0:21:02,000 --> 0:21:05,000
Now, if you assume that this greater cross wiring

455
0:21:05,000 --> 0:21:08,000
and concepts are also in different parts of the brain,

456
0:21:08,000 --> 0:21:11,000
then it's going to create a greater propensity

457
0:21:11,000 --> 0:21:14,000
towards metaphorical thinking and creativity

458
0:21:14,000 --> 0:21:16,000
in people with synesthesia.

459
0:21:16,000 --> 0:21:19,000
And, hence, the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia

460
0:21:19,000 --> 0:21:21,000
among poets, artists and novelists.

461
0:21:21,000 --> 0:21:24,000
OK, it's a very phrenological view of synesthesia.

462
0:21:24,000 --> 0:21:26,000
The last demonstration -- can I take one minute?

463
0:21:26,000 --> 0:21:28,000
(Applause)

464
0:21:28,000 --> 0:21:33,000
OK. I'm going to show you that you're all synesthetes, but you're in denial about it.

465
0:21:33,000 --> 0:21:37,000
Here's what I call Martian alphabet. Just like your alphabet,

466
0:21:37,000 --> 0:21:4,000
A is A, B is B, C is C.

467
0:21:4,000 --> 0:21:43,000
Different shapes for different phonemes, right?

468
0:21:43,000 --> 0:21:45,000
Here, you've got Martian alphabet.

469
0:21:45,000 --> 0:21:47,000
One of them is Kiki, one of them is Bouba.

470
0:21:47,000 --> 0:21:49,000
Which one is Kiki and which one is Bouba?

471
0:21:49,000 --> 0:21:51,000
How many of you think that's Kiki and that's Bouba? Raise your hands.

472
0:21:51,000 --> 0:21:53,000
Well, it's one or two mutants.

473
0:21:53,000 --> 0:21:54,000
(Laughter)

474
0:21:54,000 --> 0:21:56,000
How many of you think that's Bouba, that's Kiki? Raise your hands.

475
0:21:56,000 --> 0:21:58,000
Ninety-nine percent of you.

476
0:21:58,000 --> 0:22:,000
Now, none of you is a Martian. How did you do that?

477
0:22:,000 --> 0:22:05,000
It's because you're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction,

478
0:22:05,000 --> 0:22:09,000
meaning you're saying that that sharp inflection -- ki-ki,

479
0:22:09,000 --> 0:22:14,000
in your auditory cortex, the hair cells being excited -- Kiki,

480
0:22:14,000 --> 0:22:17,000
mimics the visual inflection, sudden inflection of that jagged shape.

481
0:22:17,000 --> 0:22:2,000
Now, this is very important, because what it's telling you

482
0:22:2,000 --> 0:22:22,000
is your brain is engaging in a primitive --

483
0:22:22,000 --> 0:22:24,000
it's just -- it looks like a silly illusion,

484
0:22:24,000 --> 0:22:28,000
but these photons in your eye are doing this shape,

485
0:22:28,000 --> 0:22:31,000
and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern,

486
0:22:31,000 --> 0:22:36,000
but the brain is able to extract the common denominator.

487
0:22:36,000 --> 0:22:38,000
It's a primitive form of abstraction,

488
0:22:38,000 --> 0:22:43,000
and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain,

489
0:22:43,000 --> 0:22:44,000
because when that's damaged,

490
0:22:44,000 --> 0:22:48,000
these people lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki,

491
0:22:48,000 --> 0:22:5,000
but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor.

492
0:22:5,000 --> 0:22:54,000
If you ask this guy, what -- "all that glitters is not gold,"

493
0:22:54,000 --> 0:22:56,000
what does that mean?"

494
0:22:56,000 --> 0:22:58,000
The patient says, "Well, if it's metallic and shiny, it doesn't mean it's gold.

495
0:22:58,000 --> 0:23:01,000
You have to measure its specific gravity, OK?"

496
0:23:01,000 --> 0:23:04,000
So, they completely miss the metaphorical meaning.

497
0:23:04,000 --> 0:23:07,000
So, this area is about eight times the size in higher --

498
0:23:07,000 --> 0:23:1,000
especially in humans -- as in lower primates.

499
0:23:1,000 --> 0:23:13,000
Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus,

500
0:23:13,000 --> 0:23:16,000
because it's the crossroads between hearing, vision and touch,

501
0:23:16,000 --> 0:23:2,000
and it became enormous in humans. And something very interesting is going on.

502
0:23:2,000 --> 0:23:23,000
And I think it's a basis of many uniquely human abilities

503
0:23:23,000 --> 0:23:26,000
like abstraction, metaphor and creativity.

504
0:23:26,000 --> 0:23:29,000
All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia,

505
0:23:29,000 --> 0:23:33,000
we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging,

506
0:23:33,000 --> 0:23:35,000
and by studying patients and asking the right questions.

507
0:23:35,000 --> 0:23:37,000
Thank you.

508
0:23:37,000 --> 0:23:38,000
(Applause)

509
0:23:38,000 --> 0:23:39,000
Sorry about that.

510
0:23:39,000 --> 0:23:4,000
(Laughter)

1
0:00:12.89,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Growing up, I didn't always understand

2
0:00:15.19,000 --> 0:00:17,000
why my parents made me follow the rules that they did.

3
0:00:17.885,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Like, why did I really have to mow the lawn?

4
0:00:20.675,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Why was homework really that important?

5
0:00:23.343,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Why couldn't I put jelly beans in my oatmeal?

6
0:00:27.267,000 --> 0:00:29,000
My childhood was abound with questions like this.

7
0:00:30.123,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Normal things about being a kid and realizing that sometimes,

8
0:00:34.396,000 --> 0:00:38,000
it was best to listen to my parents even when I didn't exactly understand why.

9
0:00:38.479,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And it's not that they didn't want me to think critically.

10
0:00:41.495,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Their parenting always sought to reconcile the tension

11
0:00:44.096,000 --> 0:00:47,000
between having my siblings and I understand the realities of the world,

12
0:00:47.547,000 --> 0:00:51,000
while ensuring that we never accepted the status quo as inevitable.

13
0:00:51.654,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I came to realize that this, in and of itself,

14
0:00:54.964,000 --> 0:00:56,000
was a very purposeful form of education.

15
0:00:58.05,000 --> 0:01:02,000
One of my favorite educators, Brazilian author and scholar Paulo Freire,

16
0:01:02.17,000 --> 0:01:05,000
speaks quite explicitly about the need for education

17
0:01:05.269,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to be used as a tool for critical awakening and shared humanity.

18
0:01:09.857,000 --> 0:01:11,000
In his most famous book, "Pedagogy of the Oppressed,"

19
0:01:12.642,000 --> 0:01:16,000
he states, "No one can be authentically human

20
0:01:17.156,000 --> 0:01:19,000
while he prevents others from being so."

21
0:01:20.167,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I've been thinking a lot about this lately, this idea of humanity,

22
0:01:23.987,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and specifically, who in this world is afforded the privilege

23
0:01:27.264,000 --> 0:01:3,000
of being perceived as fully human.

24
0:01:30.28,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Over the course of the past several months,

25
0:01:32.61,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the world has watched as unarmed black men, and women,

26
0:01:35.818,000 --> 0:01:38,000
have had their lives taken at the hands of police and vigilante.

27
0:01:39.755,000 --> 0:01:41,000
These events and all that has transpired after them

28
0:01:42.648,000 --> 0:01:44,000
have brought me back to my own childhood

29
0:01:44.756,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and the decisions that my parents made about raising a black boy in America

30
0:01:49.1,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that growing up, I didn't always understand in the way that I do now.

31
0:01:53.977,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I think of how hard it must have been, how profoundly unfair it must have felt

32
0:01:58.212,000 --> 0:02:02,000
for them to feel like they had to strip away parts of my childhood

33
0:02:02.409,000 --> 0:02:04,000
just so that I could come home at night.

34
0:02:05.21,000 --> 0:02:07,000
For example, I think of how one night,

35
0:02:07.311,000 --> 0:02:1,000
when I was around 12 years old, on an overnight field trip to another city,

36
0:02:11.213,000 --> 0:02:13,000
my friends and I bought Super Soakers

37
0:02:13.559,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and turned the hotel parking lot into our own water-filled battle zone.

38
0:02:18.102,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We hid behind cars,

39
0:02:19.805,000 --> 0:02:22,000
running through the darkness that lay between the streetlights,

40
0:02:22.973,000 --> 0:02:25,000
boundless laughter ubiquitous across the pavement.

41
0:02:26.384,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But within 10 minutes,

42
0:02:28.467,000 --> 0:02:31,000
my father came outside, grabbed me by my forearm

43
0:02:31.48,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and led me into our room with an unfamiliar grip.

44
0:02:34.505,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Before I could say anything,

45
0:02:36.369,000 --> 0:02:39,000
tell him how foolish he had made me look in front of my friends,

46
0:02:39.727,000 --> 0:02:42,000
he derided me for being so naive.

47
0:02:42.842,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Looked me in the eye, fear consuming his face,

48
0:02:47.385,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and said, "Son, I'm sorry,

49
0:02:49.93,000 --> 0:02:52,000
but you can't act the same as your white friends.

50
0:02:52.967,000 --> 0:02:54,000
You can't pretend to shoot guns.

51
0:02:55.202,000 --> 0:02:56,000
You can't run around in the dark.

52
0:02:57.088,000 --> 0:03:,000
You can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth."

53
0:03:00.132,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I know now how scared he must have been,

54
0:03:03.135,000 --> 0:03:07,000
how easily I could have fallen into the empty of the night,

55
0:03:07.148,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that some man would mistake this water

56
0:03:09.907,000 --> 0:03:11,000
for a good reason to wash all of this away.

57
0:03:13.134,000 --> 0:03:16,000
These are the sorts of messages I've been inundated with my entire life:

58
0:03:16.546,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Always keep your hands where they can see them, don't move too quickly,

59
0:03:20.045,000 --> 0:03:22,000
take off your hood when the sun goes down.

60
0:03:22.116,000 --> 0:03:25,000
My parents raised me and my siblings in an armor of advice,

61
0:03:25.223,000 --> 0:03:28,000
an ocean of alarm bells so someone wouldn't steal the breath from our lungs,

62
0:03:28.854,000 --> 0:03:3,000
so that they wouldn't make a memory of this skin.

63
0:03:31.166,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So that we could be kids, not casket or concrete.

64
0:03:33.674,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And it's not because they thought it would make us better than anyone else

65
0:03:37.154,000 --> 0:03:39,000
it's simply because they wanted to keep us alive.

66
0:03:39.672,000 --> 0:03:41,000
All of my black friends were raised with the same message,

67
0:03:42.402,000 --> 0:03:44,000
the talk, given to us when we became old enough

68
0:03:44.679,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to be mistaken for a nail ready to be hammered to the ground,

69
0:03:47.624,000 --> 0:03:51,000
when people made our melanin synonymous with something to be feared.

70
0:03:52.118,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But what does it do to a child

71
0:03:54.591,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to grow up knowing that you cannot simply be a child?

72
0:03:58.041,000 --> 0:04:01,000
That the whims of adolescence are too dangerous for your breath,

73
0:04:01.19,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that you cannot simply be curious,

74
0:04:02.854,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that you are not afforded the luxury of making a mistake,

75
0:04:05.548,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that someone's implicit bias

76
0:04:07.316,000 --> 0:04:09,000
might be the reason you don't wake up in the morning.

77
0:04:10.156,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But this cannot be what defines us.

78
0:04:11.871,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Because we have parents who raised us to understand

79
0:04:14.462,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that our bodies weren't meant for the backside of a bullet,

80
0:04:17.238,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but for flying kites and jumping rope, and laughing until our stomachs burst.

81
0:04:20.872,000 --> 0:04:22,000
We had teachers who taught us how to raise our hands in class,

82
0:04:23.856,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and not just to signal surrender,

83
0:04:25.424,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and that the only thing we should give up

84
0:04:27.39,000 --> 0:04:29,000
is the idea that we aren't worthy of this world.

85
0:04:29.763,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So when we say that black lives matter, it's not because others don't,

86
0:04:33.043,000 --> 0:04:36,000
it's simply because we must affirm that we are worthy of existing without fear,

87
0:04:36.751,000 --> 0:04:38,000
when so many things tell us we are not.

88
0:04:38.877,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I want to live in a world where my son

89
0:04:40.839,000 --> 0:04:42,000
will not be presumed guilty the moment he is born,

90
0:04:43.327,000 --> 0:04:46,000
where a toy in his hand isn't mistaken for anything other than a toy.

91
0:04:47.178,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And I refuse to accept that we can't build this world into something new,

92
0:04:50.613,000 --> 0:04:51,000
some place where a child's name

93
0:04:52.11,000 --> 0:04:54,000
doesn't have to be written on a t-shirt, or a tombstone,

94
0:04:54.857,000 --> 0:04:55,000
where the value of someone's life

95
0:04:56.474,000 --> 0:04:59,000
isn't determined by anything other than the fact that they had lungs,

96
0:05:00.273,000 --> 0:05:04,000
a place where every single one of us can breathe.

97
0:05:04.491,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Thank you.

98
0:05:05.445,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Applause)

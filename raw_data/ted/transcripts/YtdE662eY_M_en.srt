1
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
In the year 1919,

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
a virtually unknown German mathematician, named Theodor Kaluza

3
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
suggested a very bold and, in some ways, a very bizarre idea.

4
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
He proposed that our universe

5
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
might actually have more than the three dimensions

6
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that we are all aware of.

7
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
That is in addition to left, right, back, forth and up, down,

8
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space

9
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that for some reason we don't yet see.

10
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Now, when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea,

11
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
sometimes that's all it is -- bold and bizarre,

12
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
but it has nothing to do with the world around us.

13
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
This particular idea, however --

14
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
although we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong,

15
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and at the end I'll discuss experiments which, in the next few years,

16
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
may tell us whether it's right or wrong --

17
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century

18
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research.

19
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So, I'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions.

20
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So where do we go?

21
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
To begin we need a little bit of back story. Go to 1907.

22
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
This is a year when Einstein is basking in the glow

23
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
of having discovered the special theory of relativity

24
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and decides to take on a new project,

25
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
to try to understand fully the grand, pervasive force of gravity.

26
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And in that moment, there are many people around

27
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
who thought that that project had already been resolved.

28
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Newton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late 1600s

29
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that works well, describes the motion of planets,

30
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
the motion of the moon and so forth,

31
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
the motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees,

32
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
hitting people on the head.

33
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
All of that could be described using Newton's work.

34
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story,

35
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
because even Newton had written

36
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity,

37
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
he'd been unable to figure out how it really works.

38
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
How is it that the Sun, 93 million miles away,

39
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
[that] somehow it affects the motion of the Earth?

40
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
How does the Sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence?

41
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And that is a task to which Einstein set himself --

42
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to figure out how gravity works.

43
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And let me show you what it is that he found.

44
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So Einstein found

45
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself.

46
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The idea goes like this:

47
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
imagine space is a substrate of all there is.

48
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Einstein said space is nice and flat, if there's no matter present.

49
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But if there is matter in the environment, such as the Sun,

50
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
it causes the fabric of space to warp, to curve.

51
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
And that communicates the force of gravity.

52
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Even the Earth warps space around it.

53
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Now look at the Moon.

54
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The Moon is kept in orbit, according to these ideas,

55
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment

56
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that the Sun and the Moon and the Earth can all create by virtue of their presence.

57
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We go to a full-frame view of this.

58
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The Earth itself is kept in orbit

59
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
because it rolls along a valley in the environment that's curved

60
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
because of the Sun's presence.

61
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
That is this new idea about how gravity actually works.

62
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Now, this idea was tested in 1919 through astronomical observations.

63
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It really works. It describes the data.

64
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And this gained Einstein prominence around the world.

65
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And that is what got Kaluza thinking.

66
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
He, like Einstein, was in search of what we call a unified theory.

67
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
That's one theory

68
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that might be able to describe all of nature's forces from one set of ideas,

69
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
one set of principles, one master equation, if you will.

70
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So Kaluza said to himself,

71
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Einstein has been able to describe gravity

72
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
in terms of warps and curves in space --

73
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
in fact, space and time, to be more precise.

74
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Maybe I can play the same game with the other known force,

75
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
which was, at that time, known as the electromagnetic force --

76
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
we know of others today, but at that time

77
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that was the only other one people were thinking about.

78
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
You know, the force responsible for electricity

79
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and magnetic attraction and so forth.

80
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So Kaluza says, maybe I can play the same game

81
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves.

82
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
That raised a question: warps and curves in what?

83
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Einstein had already used up space and time,

84
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
warps and curves, to describe gravity.

85
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
There didn't seem to be anything else to warp or curve.

86
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So Kaluza said, well, maybe there are more dimensions of space.

87
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
He said, if I want to describe one more force,

88
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
maybe I need one more dimension.

89
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space, not three,

90
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves

91
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
in that fourth dimension. Now here's the thing:

92
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves

93
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
in a universe with four space dimensions, not three,

94
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
he found the old equations that Einstein had already derived in three dimensions --

95
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
those were for gravity --

96
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension.

97
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And when he looked at that equation,

98
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
it was none other than the equation

99
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force.

100
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Amazing -- it just popped out.

101
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
He was so excited by this realization

102
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that he ran around his house screaming, "Victory!" --

103
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that he had found the unified theory.

104
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now clearly, Kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously.

105
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
He, in fact --

106
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim,

107
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
he read a book, a treatise on swimming --

108
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
(Laughter)

109
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
-- then dove into the ocean.

110
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
This is a man who would risk his life on theory.

111
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Now, but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded,

112
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
two questions immediately arise from his observation.

113
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Number one: if there are more dimensions in space, where are they?

114
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We don't seem to see them.

115
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And number two: does this theory really work in detail,

116
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
when you try to apply it to the world around us?

117
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Now, the first question was answered in 1926

118
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
by a fellow named Oskar Klein.

119
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
He suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties --

120
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
there might be big, easy-to-see dimensions,

121
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
but there might also be tiny, curled-up dimensions,

122
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
curled up so small, even though they're all around us,

123
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that we don't see them.

124
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Let me show you that one visually.

125
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So, imagine you're looking at something

126
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
like a cable supporting a traffic light.

127
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
It's in Manhattan. You're in Central Park -- it's kind of irrelevant --

128
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but the cable looks one-dimensional from a distant viewpoint,

129
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
but you and I all know that it does have some thickness.

130
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It's very hard to see it, though, from far away.

131
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
But if we zoom in and take the perspective of, say,

132
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
a little ant walking around --

133
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions --

134
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the long dimension,

135
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
but also this clockwise, counter-clockwise direction.

136
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And I hope you appreciate this.

137
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It took so long to get these ants to do this.

138
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Laughter)

139
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
But this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts:

140
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
big and small. And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us

141
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
are the ones that we can easily see,

142
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
but there might be additional dimensions curled up,

143
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
sort of like the circular part of that cable,

144
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
so small that they have so far remained invisible.

145
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Let me show you what that would look like.

146
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So, if we take a look, say, at space itself --

147
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I can only show, of course, two dimensions on a screen.

148
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Some of you guys will fix that one day,

149
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
but anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension,

150
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
goes smaller, smaller, smaller,

151
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself,

152
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
this is the idea,

153
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
you could have additional curled up dimensions --

154
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
here is a little shape of a circle -- so small that we don't see them.

155
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around,

156
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about --

157
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that's like the grid part --

158
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but you could also access the tiny curled-up dimension

159
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that's so small that we can't see it with the naked eye

160
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
or even with any of our most refined equipment.

161
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
But deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself,

162
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
the idea is there could be more dimensions, as we see there.

163
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Now that's an explanation

164
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see.

165
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
But what about the second question that I asked:

166
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
does the theory actually work

167
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
when you try to apply it to the real world?

168
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Well, it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others

169
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
worked on trying to refine this framework

170
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and apply it to the physics of the universe

171
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
as was understood at the time, and, in detail, it didn't work.

172
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
In detail, for instance,

173
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
they couldn't get the mass of the electron

174
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to work out correctly in this theory.

175
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So many people worked on it, but by the '40s, certainly by the '50s,

176
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
this strange but very compelling idea

177
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away.

178
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Until something wonderful happened in our age.

179
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
In our era, a new approach to unify the laws of physics

180
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
is being pursued by physicists such as myself,

181
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
many others around the world,

182
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
it's called superstring theory, as you were indicating.

183
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And the wonderful thing is that superstring theory

184
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions,

185
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
but when we study superstring theory,

186
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling, new form.

187
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So, let me just tell you how that goes.

188
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Superstring theory -- what is it?

189
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Well, it's a theory that tries to answer the question:

190
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
what are the basic, fundamental, indivisible, uncuttable constituents

191
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
making up everything in the world around us?

192
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The idea is like this.

193
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
So, imagine we look at a familiar object, just a candle in a holder,

194
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of.

195
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents.

196
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So deep inside -- we all know, you go sufficiently far down, you have atoms.

197
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
We also all know that atoms are not the end of the story.

198
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
They have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus

199
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
with neutrons and protons.

200
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Even the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks.

201
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
That is where conventional ideas stop.

202
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Here is the new idea of string theory.

203
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Deep inside any of these particles, there is something else.

204
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
This something else is this dancing filament of energy.

205
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It looks like a vibrating string --

206
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that's where the idea, string theory comes from.

207
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello

208
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
can vibrate in different patterns,

209
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
these can also vibrate in different patterns.

210
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
They don't produce different musical notes.

211
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Rather, they produce the different particles making up the world around us.

212
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So if these ideas are correct,

213
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
this is what the ultra-microscopic landscape of the universe looks like.

214
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It's built up of a huge number

215
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy,

216
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
vibrating in different frequencies.

217
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
The different frequencies produce the different particles.

218
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
The different particles are responsible

219
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
for all the richness in the world around us.

220
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And there you see unification,

221
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
because matter particles, electrons and quarks,

222
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
radiation particles, photons, gravitons, are all built up from one entity.

223
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So matter and the forces of nature all are put together

224
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
under the rubric of vibrating strings.

225
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And that's what we mean by a unified theory.

226
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Now here is the catch.

227
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
When you study the mathematics of string theory,

228
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
you find that it doesn't work

229
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
in a universe that just has three dimensions of space.

230
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
It doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space, nor five, nor six.

231
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Finally, you can study the equations, and show that it works

232
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
only in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space

233
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and one dimension of time.

234
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
It leads us right back to this idea of Kaluza and Klein --

235
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that our world, when appropriately described,

236
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
has more dimensions than the ones that we see.

237
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Now you might think about that and say, well,

238
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
OK, you know, if you have extra dimensions, and they're really tightly curled up,

239
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
yeah, perhaps we won't see them, if they're small enough.

240
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
But if there's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there,

241
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and you make them small enough, and we won't see them either. That is true.

242
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
One of the other predictions of string theory --

243
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
no, that's not one of the other predictions of string theory.

244
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
(Laughter)

245
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
But it raises the question:

246
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions,

247
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
or do they tell us something about the world?

248
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
In the remaining time, I'd like to tell you two features of them.

249
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
First is, many of us believe that these extra dimensions

250
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question

251
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
in theoretical physics, theoretical science.

252
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And that question is this: when we look around the world,

253
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
as scientists have done for the last hundred years,

254
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe.

255
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
These are numbers like the mass of the particles,

256
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
like electrons and quarks, the strength of gravity,

257
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
the strength of the electromagnetic force --

258
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
a list of about 20 numbers

259
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
that have been measured with incredible precision,

260
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
but nobody has an explanation

261
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
for why the numbers have the particular values that they do.

262
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Now, does string theory offer an answer?

263
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Not yet.

264
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do

265
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
may rely on the form of the extra dimensions.

266
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And the wonderful thing is, if those numbers

267
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
had any other values than the known ones,

268
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
the universe, as we know it, wouldn't exist.

269
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
This is a deep question.

270
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Why are those numbers so finely tuned

271
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
to allow stars to shine and planets to form,

272
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
when we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers --

273
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
if I had 20 dials up here

274
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and I let you come up and fiddle with those numbers,

275
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
almost any fiddling makes the universe disappear.

276
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
So can we explain those 20 numbers?

277
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And string theory suggests that those 20 numbers

278
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
have to do with the extra dimensions.

279
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Let me show you how.

280
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory,

281
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
it's not one extra dimension,

282
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
as in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein.

283
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions.

284
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
They have a very rich, intertwined geometry.

285
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
This is an example of something known as a Calabi-Yau shape --

286
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
name isn't all that important.

287
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
But, as you can see,

288
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
the extra dimensions fold in on themselves

289
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and intertwine in a very interesting shape, interesting structure.

290
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like,

291
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us

292
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
would look like this on the tiniest of scales.

293
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
When you swing your hand,

294
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
you'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again,

295
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
but they're so small that we wouldn't know it.

296
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
So what is the physical implication, though, relevant to those 20 numbers?

297
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Consider this. If you look at the instrument, a French horn,

298
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
notice that the vibrations of the airstreams

299
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
are affected by the shape of the instrument.

300
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Now in string theory,

301
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate.

302
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
So just as those airstreams

303
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument,

304
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
strings themselves will be affected

305
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving.

306
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
So let me bring some strings into the story.

307
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
And if you watch these little fellows vibrating around --

308
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
they'll be there in a second -- right there,

309
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
notice that they way they vibrate is affected

310
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
by the geometry of the extra dimensions.

311
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
So, if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like --

312
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
we don't yet, but if we did --

313
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
we should be able to calculate the allowed notes,

314
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
the allowed vibrational patterns.

315
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
And if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns,

316
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
we should be able to calculate those 20 numbers.

317
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And if the answer that we get from our calculations

318
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
agrees with the values of those numbers

319
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
that have been determined

320
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
through detailed and precise experimentation,

321
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation

322
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
for why the structure of the universe is the way it is.

323
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Now, the second issue that I want to finish up with is:

324
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly?

325
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Is this just an interesting mathematical structure

326
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
that might be able to explain

327
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
some previously unexplained features of the world,

328
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
or can we actually test for these extra dimensions?

329
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:38,000
And we think -- and this is, I think, very exciting --

330
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
that in the next five years or so we may be able to test

331
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
for the existence of these extra dimensions.

332
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Here's how it goes. In CERN, Geneva, Switzerland,

333
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
a machine is being built called the Large Hadron Collider.

334
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
It's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel,

335
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
opposite directions, near the speed of light.

336
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Every so often those particles will be aimed at each other,

337
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
so there's a head-on collision.

338
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
The hope is that if the collision has enough energy,

339
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
it may eject some of the debris from the collision

340
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
from our dimensions, forcing it to enter into the other dimensions.

341
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
How would we know it?

342
0:17:18.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Well, we'll measure the amount of energy after the collision,

343
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:23,000
compare it to the amount of energy before,

344
0:17:23.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
and if there's less energy after the collision than before,

345
0:17:27.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away.

346
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
And if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate,

347
0:17:32.16,000 --> 0:17:35,000
this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there.

348
0:17:35.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Let me show you that idea visually.

349
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
So, imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton --

350
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
that's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out,

351
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
if the extra dimensions are real.

352
0:17:46.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
But here's how the experiment will go.

353
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
You take these particles. You slam them together.

354
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
You slam them together, and if we are right,

355
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
some of the energy of that collision

356
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:17:58,000
will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions.

357
0:17:58.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
So this is the kind of experiment

358
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:04,000
that we'll be looking at in the next five, seven to 10 years or so.

359
0:18:04.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
And if this experiment bears fruit,

360
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
if we see that kind of particle ejected

361
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions

362
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
than when we began,

363
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
this will show that the extra dimensions are real.

364
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:21,000
And to me this is a really remarkable story,

365
0:18:21.16,000 --> 0:18:25,000
and a remarkable opportunity. Going back to Newton with absolute space --

366
0:18:25.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
didn't provide anything but an arena, a stage

367
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:29,000
in which the events of the universe take place.

368
0:18:29.16,000 --> 0:18:31,000
Einstein comes along and says,

369
0:18:31.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
well, space and time can warp and curve -- that's what gravity is.

370
0:18:34.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
And now string theory comes along and says,

371
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
yes, gravity, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism,

372
0:18:41.16,000 --> 0:18:43,000
all together in one package,

373
0:18:43.16,000 --> 0:18:47,000
but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see.

374
0:18:47.16,000 --> 0:18:52,000
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime.

375
0:18:52.16,000 --> 0:18:54,000
Amazing possibility.

376
0:18:54.16,000 --> 0:18:56,000
Thank you very much.

377
0:18:56.16,000 --> 0:19:03,000

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Welcome to 10,000 feet.

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Let me explain why we are here

3
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and why some of you have a pine cone close to you.

4
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Once upon a time, I did a book called "How Buildings Learn."

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Today's event you might call "How Mountains Teach."

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
A little background: For 10 years I've been trying to figure out how to

7
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
hack civilization so that we can get long-term thinking

8
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare --

9
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
or in some cases, non-existent.

10
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking

11
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
of the now not just as next week or next quarter, but you know,

12
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
next 10,000 years and the last 10,000 years --

13
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
basically civilization's story so far.

14
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
So we have the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco.

15
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It's an incubator for about a dozen projects,

16
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
all having to do with continuity over the long term.

17
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Our core project is a rather ambitious folly --

18
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I suppose, a mythic undertaking: to build a 10,000-year clock

19
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that can really keep good time for that long a period.

20
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious.

21
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Go to the clock. And what we have here is something

22
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
many of you saw here three years ago.

23
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It's the first working prototype of the clock.

24
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It's about nine feet high.

25
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Designed by Danny Hillis and Alexander Rose. It's presently in London,

26
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there.

27
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So the design problem for today is going to be,

28
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this

29
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
so it can really tick, save time beautifully for 100 centuries?

30
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Well, this was the first solution.

31
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Alexander Rose came up with this idea

32
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps.

33
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And it looked like a way to go, until you start thinking

34
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
about, what does deep time do to a building?

35
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Well, this is what deep time does to a building.

36
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
This is the Parthenon. It's only 2,450 years old,

37
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and look what happened to it.

38
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Here's a beautiful project. They really knew it'd last forever,

39
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
because they'd build it out of absolutely huge stones.

40
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for.

41
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
That's what happens to buildings. They're vulnerable.

42
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Even the most durable and intactable buildings,

43
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
like the pyramids of Giza, are in bad shape when you look up close.

44
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They've been looted inside and out.

45
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And they're built to protect things but they don't protect things.

46
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So we got to thinking, if you can't put things safely in a building,

47
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
where can you safely put them? We thought, OK, underground.

48
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
How about underground with a view?

49
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
Underground in a place that's really solid.

50
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So the obvious answer was, we need a mountain.

51
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
You don't want just any mountain.

52
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
You need absolutely the right mountain

53
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
if you're going to have a clock for 10,000 years.

54
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So here's an image of the long view of the search problem.

55
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain,

56
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
so we got looking in the dry areas of the Southwest.

57
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We looked at mesas in New Mexico.

58
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
We were looking at dead volcanoes in Arizona.

59
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Then Roger Kennedy, who was the director of the National Parks Service,

60
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
led us to Eastern Nevada,

61
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to America's newest and oldest national park,

62
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
which is called Great Basin National Park.

63
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It's right on the eastern border of Nevada.

64
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It's the highest range in the state -- over 13,000 feet.

65
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And you'll notice that on the left, on the left, on the west, it's very steep,

66
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and on the right it's gentle.

67
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
This place is remote. It's over 200 miles from any major city.

68
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It's nowhere near any Interstate or railroad.

69
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And it's -- the only thing that goes by is what's called

70
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
America's loneliest highway, U.S. 50.

71
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Now, inside the yellow line here, on the right is -- that's all national park.

72
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Inside the green line is national forest.

73
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And then over to the left is Bureau of Land Management land and some private land.

74
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Now, as it happened, that two-mile-long strip right in the middle,

75
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
this vertical, was available because it was private land.

76
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And thanks to Jay Walker who was here and Mitch Kapor who was here,

77
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
who started the process, Long Now was able to get that two-mile-long strip of land.

78
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And now let's look at the grand truth of what's there.

79
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
We're in Pole Canyon, looking west up the western escarpment

80
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
of Mount Washington, which is 11,600 feet on top.

81
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Those white cliffs are a dense Cambrian limestone.

82
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
That's a 2,000-foot thick formation,

83
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock.

84
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It would be a pilgrimage to get to it; it would be a serious hike

85
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to get up to where the clock is.

86
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So last June, the Long Now board, some staff and some donors

87
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and advisors, made a two-week expedition to the mountain

88
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to explore it and investigate, one, if it's the right mountain,

89
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and two, if it's the right mountain, how it might actually work for us.

90
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Now Danny Hillis sort of framed the problem.

91
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
He has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work.

92
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure.

93
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It starts with the image. The image is a picture you have in your mind

94
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
of the goal at the end of the journey.

95
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
In this case it might well be an image of the clock.

96
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Then there's the point of embarkation, that is, the point of transition

97
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest.

98
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Then -- this is a nice image of it, there's the labyrinth.

99
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The labyrinth is a concept, it's like a twilight zone,

100
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
it's a place where it's difficult, where you get disoriented,

101
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
maybe you get scared -- but you have to go through it

102
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
if you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration.

103
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Then there should always be in sight the draw --

104
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
a kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth

105
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to finish the process of getting there.

106
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Now Brian Eno, who's been in the thick of the Long Now process,

107
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
spent two years making a C.D. called "January 7003,"

108
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and it's "Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now."

109
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Based on -- parts of it are based on an algorithm that Danny Hillis developed,

110
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
so that a peal of 10 bells

111
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
makes a different peal every day for 10,000 years.

112
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The Hillis algorithm. 10 factorial gives you that number.

113
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And in fact, pretty soon we'll hear the sound.

114
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
January 7003. There it is.

115
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
OK, back to Danny's list.

116
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Number five of the seven is the payoff. This is it. The climax.

117
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The goal. The main thing that you're trying to get to.

118
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And then Danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff.

119
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Something you didn't expect that caps what you did expect.

120
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Then there's the return.

121
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
You've got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world,

122
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
so you have time to assimilate what you've learned.

123
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And then, how about a memento? Number seven.

124
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
At the end of it there's something physical,

125
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
a kind of reward that you take away.

126
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain.

127
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Something that's just yours.

128
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
How do you study a mountain

129
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
for the kinds of things we're talking about?

130
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
This is not a normal building project.

131
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
What do you look for?

132
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
What are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions?

133
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Start with borders. If you look on the left side of the cliffs here,

134
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that's national park. That's sacrosanct --

135
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
you can't do anything with that. To the right of it is national forest.

136
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
There's possibilities. The borders are important.

137
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Other elements were mines, weather, approaches and elevation.

138
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And especially trees. Look at those things up on top there.

139
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It turns out that Mount Washington is covered with bristlecone pines.

140
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
They're the world's oldest living thing.

141
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
People think they're just the size of shrubs, but that's not actually true.

142
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
There are trees on that mountain that are 5,000 years old and still living.

143
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
The wood is so solid it's like stone, and it lasts for a long time.

144
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain,

145
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
some of them go back 10,000 years.

146
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The stone itself is absolutely beautiful,

147
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
sculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there.

148
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We had tree ring analysts from the University of Arizona

149
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
join us on the expedition.

150
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Now, if you guys have a pine cone handy,

151
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
now's a good time to put it in your hand and feel it, especially on the end.

152
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
That's interesting.

153
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
You'll find out why it's called a bristlecone pine. A little sensory experience.

154
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Here's Danny Hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest

155
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
on Long Now land. I should say that the age of bristlecones

156
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
was discovered, led by a theory.

157
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Edmund Schulman in the 1950s

158
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
had been studying trees under great stress at Timberline,

159
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and came to the realization that he put in an article in Science magazine

160
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
called, "Longevity under Adversity in Conifers."

161
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And then, based on that principle, he started looking around

162
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
at the various trees at Timberline,

163
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and realized that the bristlecone pines --

164
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
he found some in the White Mountains that were over 4,000 years old.

165
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right.

166
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
OK, onto the mines. The first asking price for the property

167
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
when we looked at it in 1998 was one billion dollars for 180 acres and a couple of mines.

168
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Because the owner said, "There's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain."

169
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And we said, "Wow, that's great. Listen, we'll counter. How about zero?

170
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
(Laughter)

171
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And we're a non-profit foundation, you can give us the property

172
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and take a hell of a tax deduction.

173
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Laughter)

174
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
All you have to do is prove to the government it's worth a billion dollars."

175
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Well, a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth,

176
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and by and by, thanks to Mitch and Jay,

177
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
we were able to buy the whole property for 140,000 dollars.

178
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
This is one of the mines. It doesn't have any beryllium in it.

179
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
It's called the Pole Adit. And it does have tungsten,

180
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
a little bit of tungsten, left over, that's the kind of mine it was.

181
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line,

182
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
due east into the range, into very interesting territory -- except that,

183
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
as you'll see when we go inside in a minute,

184
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale.

185
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And shale is not quite completely competent rock.

186
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring.

187
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
The shale would like some shoring,

188
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and so parts of it are caved in in there.

189
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
That's Ben Roberts from -- he's the bat specialist from the National Park.

190
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
But there are many wonders back in there, like this weird fungus

191
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
on some of the collapsed timbers.

192
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
OK, here's another mine that's up on top of the property,

193
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and it dates back to 1870.

194
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
That's what the property was originally built around --

195
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
it was a set of mining claims. It was a very productive silver mine.

196
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
In fact, it was the highest-operating mine in Nevada,

197
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and it ran year round.

198
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
You can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet.

199
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
You may recognize a couple of the miners there.

200
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
There's Jeff Bezos on the right and Paul Saville on the left looking for galena,

201
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
which is the lead-silver thing. They didn't find any.

202
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
They both kept their day jobs. Here's the last mine.

203
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
It's called the Bonanza Adit. It's down in a canyon.

204
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And Alexander Rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people

205
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
from the National Park to survey the whole mine. It's a mile deep.

206
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And they also found four species of bats in there.

207
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Now, almost all those mines, by the way, meet underneath the mountain.

208
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
They don't quite, but it's something to think about.

209
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
They don't quite meet.

210
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Let's go to weather. Mountains specialize in interesting weather.

211
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Way more interesting than Monterey even today.

212
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And so one Tuesday morning last June, there we were.

213
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Woke up in the morning -- the mountain was covered with snow.

214
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
That was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again,

215
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
thanks to Mitch Kapor, we're building up there.

216
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And it's a pretty interesting scene.

217
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
This is, on the left there, the joyful lady is Pat Irwin,

218
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
who's the regional head of the National Forest Service,

219
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and they gave us the temporary use permit to be there.

220
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
We want a temporary use permit for the clock, eventually --

221
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
10,000-year temporary use permit.

222
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
(Laughter)

223
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
The weather station's pretty interesting.

224
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Kurt Bollacker and Alexander Rose designed a radically wireless station.

225
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
It runs on solar, and it sends a signal with that antenna

226
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere

227
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
to a place in Bozeman, Montana, where the data is taken down

228
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and then sent through landlines to San Francisco,

229
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
where we put the data in real time up on our website.

230
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And there you see a week of weather at 9,400 feet on Mount Washington.

231
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Let's go to approaches.

232
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
As it happens, there are no trails anywhere on Mount Washington,

233
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
just a few old mining roads like this,

234
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
so you have to bushwhack everywhere.

235
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
But there's no bears, and there's no poison oak,

236
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
and there's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time.

237
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
You can hike for days and not encounter anybody.

238
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Well, here's a potential approach.

239
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
You need to come up the Lincoln Canyon.

240
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
It's this beautiful world all of its own, surrounded by cliffs,

241
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and it's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom,

242
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
until you get to this barrier, and it actually presents a problem.

243
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
So you can scratch Lincoln Canyon as an approach.

244
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain.

245
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
You can see why we sometimes call it Long Mountain.

246
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And from where you're standing at 6,000 feet in the valley,

247
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
it's an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest

248
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
through that knoll at the front at 7,600 feet.

249
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And you can carry right on up through meadows

250
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at 10,500 feet,

251
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
where there's a bit of a problem.

252
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Now, Jeff Bezos advised us when he left at the end of the expedition,

253
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
"Make the clock inaccessible.

254
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
The harder it is to get to, the more people will value it."

255
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And check -- those are 600-foot vertical walls there.

256
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
So Alexander Rose wanted to explore this route,

257
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and he started over here on the left from his pickup truck

258
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
at 8,900 feet and headed up the mountain.

259
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Now, as you gain elevation your IQ goes down --

260
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
(Laughter)

261
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
but your emotional affect goes up,

262
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
which is great for having a mythic experience,

263
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
whether you want to or not.

264
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
In fact, Danny Hillis can estimate altitude

265
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
by how much math he can't do in his head.

266
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
(Laughter)

267
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Now, I happened to be on the radio with Alexander

268
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
when he got to this point at the base of the cliffs, and he said, quote,

269
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
"There's a hidden notch. I think I can get up a ways."

270
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
Now, he's a rock climber, but you know, he's our executive director.

271
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I don't want him killed. I know he's going to love cliffs.

272
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
I'm saying, "Be careful, be careful, be careful."

273
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Then he starts going up, and the next thing I hear is,

274
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
"I'm half-way up. It's like climbing stairs. I'm going up 60 degrees.

275
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
It's a secret passage. It's like something from Tolkien."

276
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And I'm going, "Careful, careful. Please be careful."

277
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And then, of course, the next thing I hear is,

278
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
"I've made it to the top. You can see all of creation from up here."

279
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
And he dashed across the top of the mountains.

280
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
In fact, there he is. That's Alexander Rose.

281
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
First ascent of the western face to Mount Washington,

282
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and a solo ascent at that.

283
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
This discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs

284
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and what to do with them.

285
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
We realized that we had to name this thing that Alexander discovered.

286
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
How about Zander's Crevice? No.

287
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
(Laughter)

288
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
So we finally decided on Alexander's Siq.

289
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
Zander's Siq is named after -- some of you have been to Petra,

290
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
there's this wonderful slot canyon that leads into Petra

291
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
called the Siq, and so this is the Siq.

292
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
And it really is hidden. I can't find it in this image,

293
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and I'm not sure you can.

294
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
Only when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there,

295
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and that brings it out.

296
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
Now, Danny and I were up at this same area one day,

297
0:17:18.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and Danny looked over to the right

298
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:23,000
and noticed something halfway up the cliffs,

299
0:17:23.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
which is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it,

300
0:17:27.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
and supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain

301
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:35,000
could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view.

302
0:17:35.16,000 --> 0:17:38,000
And the people toiling up the mountain could see them,

303
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
these tiny little people up there, incredibly halfway up the cliff.

304
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
How did they get there? Do I have to do that?

305
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
And so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth.

306
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:51,000
You can get another angle on Danny's porch

307
0:17:51.16,000 --> 0:17:58,000
by going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there.

308
0:17:58.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
And you need to know that Danny's clock is to be kept accurate

309
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
by a ray of sunshine, that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day,

310
0:18:06.16,000 --> 0:18:09,000
and the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger

311
0:18:09.16,000 --> 0:18:12,000
which resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate.

312
0:18:12.16,000 --> 0:18:14,000
So even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on,

313
0:18:14.16,000 --> 0:18:17,000
the clock will keep perfectly good time.

314
0:18:17.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
So here we're looking from the south, look north.

315
0:18:19.16,000 --> 0:18:23,000
This is all Forest Service land. If you go up on top of those cliffs,

316
0:18:23.16,000 --> 0:18:26,000
that's some of the Long Now land in those trees.

317
0:18:26.16,000 --> 0:18:31,000
And if you go up there and look back, then you'll get a sense of

318
0:18:31.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
what the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain.

319
0:18:34.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
That's the long view. That's 80 miles to the horizon.

320
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:42,000
And that's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs.

321
0:18:42.16,000 --> 0:18:5,000
That's a different place to be. It's 11,400 feet and it's exquisite.

322
0:18:50.16,000 --> 0:18:54,000
Now, if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs,

323
0:18:54.16,000 --> 0:18:58,000
it's 600 foot, just about a yard to the left of Kurt Bollacker's foot,

324
0:18:58.16,000 --> 0:19:03,000
there is a 600-foot drop. He's ambling on over to Zander's Siq.

325
0:19:03.16,000 --> 0:19:07,000
That's what it looks like looking down it.

326
0:19:07.16,000 --> 0:19:11,000
We should probably put in a rail or something.

327
0:19:11.16,000 --> 0:19:15,000
Over on the eastern side it's gentle, as you can see.

328
0:19:15.16,000 --> 0:19:18,000
And that's not snow -- that's what the white limestone looks like.

329
0:19:18.16,000 --> 0:19:22,000
You also see there a bighorn sheep.

330
0:19:22.16,000 --> 0:19:25,000
Their herd was reintroduced from Wyoming.

331
0:19:25.16,000 --> 0:19:28,000
And they're doing pretty well, but they've got a bit of trouble.

332
0:19:28.16,000 --> 0:19:31,000
This is Danny Hillis, and he's figuring out a design problem.

333
0:19:31.16,000 --> 0:19:36,000
he's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of Long Now land

334
0:19:36.16,000 --> 0:19:42,000
would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain.

335
0:19:42.16,000 --> 0:19:44,000
because the real peak is hidden around the corner.

336
0:19:44.16,000 --> 0:19:48,000
This is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest.

337
0:19:48.16,000 --> 0:19:51,000
And as it turned out the answer is, yes,

338
0:19:51.16,000 --> 0:19:55,000
that is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak,

339
0:19:55.16,000 --> 0:19:57,000
and that might be conjured with.

340
0:19:57.16,000 --> 0:20:02,000
We gradually realized we have three serious design domains to work on with this.

341
0:20:02.16,000 --> 0:20:04,000
One is the experience of the mountain.

342
0:20:04.16,000 --> 0:20:07,000
Another is the experience in the mountain.

343
0:20:07.16,000 --> 0:20:1,000
And the third is the experience from the mountain,

344
0:20:10.16,000 --> 0:20:13,000
which is really dominated by the view shed

345
0:20:13.16,000 --> 0:20:17,000
of the spring valley there behind Danny,

346
0:20:17.16,000 --> 0:20:19,000
and if you look off to the right, out there,

347
0:20:19.16,000 --> 0:20:23,000
15 miles across to the Schell Creek range.

348
0:20:23.16,000 --> 0:20:26,000
In the front, there are 10 ranches strung right along the base of the mountains

349
0:20:26.16,000 --> 0:20:28,000
using the water from the mountains.

350
0:20:28.16,000 --> 0:20:33,000
In fact, there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air.

351
0:20:33.16,000 --> 0:20:36,000
One of the ranches is called the Kirkeby Ranch,

352
0:20:36.16,000 --> 0:20:38,000
and I'll take you there for a minute.

353
0:20:38.16,000 --> 0:20:4,000
It's a very nice ranch.

354
0:20:40.16,000 --> 0:20:45,000
Alfalfa and cattle, run by Paul and Ronnie Brenham,

355
0:20:45.16,000 --> 0:20:5,000
and it's pretty idyllic. It's also hard work.

356
0:20:50.16,000 --> 0:20:52,000
And most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going.

357
0:20:52.16,000 --> 0:20:56,000
This is their view to the west of the Schell Creek range.

358
0:20:56.16,000 --> 0:20:59,000
And if you go out to that line of trees at the far end,

359
0:20:59.16,000 --> 0:21:03,000
you'll see what the valley used to look like.

360
0:21:03.16,000 --> 0:21:08,000
This is Rocky Mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years.

361
0:21:08.16,000 --> 0:21:11,000
And a scheme emerged that Long Now is looking to see

362
0:21:11.16,000 --> 0:21:14,000
if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley,

363
0:21:14.16,000 --> 0:21:18,000
because those 10 ranches with their 17,000 acres

364
0:21:18.16,000 --> 0:21:23,000
dominate a 500 square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on,

365
0:21:23.16,000 --> 0:21:26,000
and there's a possibility that you could get the whole thing

366
0:21:26.16,000 --> 0:21:3,000
for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition,

367
0:21:30.16,000 --> 0:21:34,000
and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park,

368
0:21:34.16,000 --> 0:21:38,000
and it would double the size of Great Basin National Park. That would be swell.

369
0:21:38.16,000 --> 0:21:41,000
OK, let's take one more look at the mountain itself.

370
0:21:41.16,000 --> 0:21:45,000
The clock experience should be profound,

371
0:21:45.16,000 --> 0:21:49,000
but from the outside it should be invisible.

372
0:21:49.16,000 --> 0:21:53,000
Now, at the base of the high cliffs there's this natural cave.

373
0:21:53.16,000 --> 0:21:57,000
It's only about 12 feet deep, but what if it were deepened from inside?

374
0:21:57.16,000 --> 0:22:,000
You excavated from somewhere, came up from inside and deepened it.

375
0:22:00.16,000 --> 0:22:01,000
And then you could have an entrance

376
0:22:01.16,000 --> 0:22:04,000
which was very rough and narrow as you first went in,

377
0:22:04.16,000 --> 0:22:08,000
that gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite.

378
0:22:08.16,000 --> 0:22:11,000
And this stone takes a perfect polish.

379
0:22:11.16,000 --> 0:22:16,000
You'd have a polished set of passages and chambers in there

380
0:22:16.16,000 --> 0:22:2,000
eventually leading to the 10,000 year clock.

381
0:22:20.16,000 --> 0:22:24,000
And it's not a mine. This would be a nuanced evocation

382
0:22:24.16,000 --> 0:22:27,000
of the basic structure of the mountain,

383
0:22:27.16,000 --> 0:22:3,000
and you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from outside.

384
0:22:30.16,000 --> 0:22:33,000
This is architecture not made by building,

385
0:22:33.16,000 --> 0:22:37,000
but by what you very carefully take away.

386
0:22:37.16,000 --> 0:22:4,000
So that's what the mountain taught us.

387
0:22:40.16,000 --> 0:22:43,000
Most of the amazingness of the clock

388
0:22:43.16,000 --> 0:22:47,000
we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain.

389
0:22:47.16,000 --> 0:22:51,000
All we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them.

390
0:22:51.16,000 --> 0:22:56,000
It's not a clock in a mountain -- it's a mountain clock.

391
0:22:56.16,000 --> 0:22:58,000
Now, the Tewa Indians in the Southwest have a saying

392
0:22:58.16,000 --> 0:23:04,000
for what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything.

393
0:23:04.16,000 --> 0:23:11,000
They say, "pin peya obe" -- welcome to the mountain.

394
0:23:11.16,000 --> 0:23:13,000
Thank you.

395
0:23:13.16,000 --> 0:23:18,000
(Applause)

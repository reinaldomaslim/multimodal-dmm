1
0:00:12.69,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Chris Anderson: We had Edward Snowden here

2
0:00:14.86,000 --> 0:00:15,000
a couple days ago,

3
0:00:16.398,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and this is response time.

4
0:00:18.741,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And several of you have written to me

5
0:00:20.996,000 --> 0:00:24,000
with questions to ask our guest here from the NSA.

6
0:00:25.639,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So Richard Ledgett is the 15th deputy director

7
0:00:27.987,000 --> 0:00:29,000
of the National Security Agency,

8
0:00:30.552,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and he's a senior civilian officer there,

9
0:00:33.838,000 --> 0:00:34,000
acts as its chief operating officer,

10
0:00:35.823,000 --> 0:00:38,000
guiding strategies, setting internal policies,

11
0:00:39.093,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and serving as the principal advisor to the director.

12
0:00:43.473,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And all being well,

13
0:00:45.349,000 --> 0:00:48,000
welcome, Rick Ledgett, to TED.

14
0:00:48.865,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Applause)

15
0:00:55.535,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Richard Ledgett: I'm really thankful for the opportunity to talk to folks here.

16
0:00:59.283,000 --> 0:01:,000
I look forward to the conversation,

17
0:01:01.237,000 --> 0:01:03,000
so thanks for arranging for that.

18
0:01:04.219,000 --> 0:01:05,000
CA: Thank you, Rick.

19
0:01:05.757,000 --> 0:01:07,000
We appreciate you joining us.

20
0:01:08.324,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It's certainly quite a strong statement

21
0:01:10.491,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that the NSA is willing to reach out

22
0:01:12.478,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and show a more open face here.

23
0:01:16.475,000 --> 0:01:17,000
You saw, I think,

24
0:01:18.428,000 --> 0:01:21,000
the talk and interview that Edward Snowden

25
0:01:22.321,000 --> 0:01:22,000
gave here a couple days ago.

26
0:01:23.265,000 --> 0:01:25,000
What did you make of it?

27
0:01:25.704,000 --> 0:01:28,000
RL: So I think it was interesting.

28
0:01:28.855,000 --> 0:01:3,000
We didn't realize that he was going to show up there,

29
0:01:31.742,000 --> 0:01:34,000
so kudos to you guys for arranging

30
0:01:34.875,000 --> 0:01:36,000
a nice surprise like that.

31
0:01:37.578,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I think that, like a lot of the things

32
0:01:42.951,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that have come out since Mr. Snowden

33
0:01:47.47,000 --> 0:01:49,000
started disclosing classified information,

34
0:01:50.035,000 --> 0:01:53,000
there were some kernels of truth in there,

35
0:01:53.501,000 --> 0:01:56,000
but a lot of extrapolations and half-truths in there,

36
0:01:56.995,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and I'm interested in helping to address those.

37
0:01:59.518,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I think this is a really important conversation

38
0:02:01.838,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that we're having in the United States

39
0:02:03.37,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and internationally,

40
0:02:04.885,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and I think it is important and of import,

41
0:02:09.294,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and so given that, we need to have that be

42
0:02:12.754,000 --> 0:02:13,000
a fact-based conversation,

43
0:02:14.154,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and we want to help make that happen.

44
0:02:16.606,000 --> 0:02:2,000
CA: So the question that a lot of people have here is,

45
0:02:21.223,000 --> 0:02:23,000
what do you make of Snowden's motivations

46
0:02:24.137,000 --> 0:02:26,000
for doing what he did,

47
0:02:26.388,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and did he have an alternative way that he could have gone?

48
0:02:30.878,000 --> 0:02:32,000
RL: He absolutely did

49
0:02:33.217,000 --> 0:02:37,000
have alternative ways that he could have gone,

50
0:02:37.415,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and I actually think that characterizing him

51
0:02:43.009,000 --> 0:02:44,000
as a whistleblower

52
0:02:44.999,000 --> 0:02:47,000
actually hurts legitimate whistleblowing activities.

53
0:02:48.527,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So what if somebody who works in the NSA --

54
0:02:52.098,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and there are over 35,000 people who do.

55
0:02:55.102,000 --> 0:02:57,000
They're all great citizens.

56
0:02:57.455,000 --> 0:02:59,000
They're just like your husbands, fathers, sisters,

57
0:02:59.758,000 --> 0:03:03,000
brothers, neighbors, nephews, friends and relatives,

58
0:03:03.975,000 --> 0:03:05,000
all of whom are interested in doing the right thing

59
0:03:06.145,000 --> 0:03:07,000
for their country

60
0:03:07.332,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and for our allies internationally,

61
0:03:10.366,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and so there are a variety of venues to address

62
0:03:14.448,000 --> 0:03:15,000
if folks have a concern.

63
0:03:15.622,000 --> 0:03:16,000
First off, there's their supervisor,

64
0:03:17.545,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and up through the supervisory chain

65
0:03:20.237,000 --> 0:03:21,000
within their organization.

66
0:03:21.979,000 --> 0:03:22,000
If folks aren't comfortable with that,

67
0:03:23.626,000 --> 0:03:25,000
there are a number of inspectors general.

68
0:03:25.981,000 --> 0:03:28,000
In the case of Mr. Snowden, he had the option

69
0:03:29.522,000 --> 0:03:3,000
of the NSA inspector general,

70
0:03:31.447,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the Navy inspector general,

71
0:03:32.767,000 --> 0:03:33,000
the Pacific Command inspector general,

72
0:03:34.334,000 --> 0:03:35,000
the Department of Defense inspector general,

73
0:03:36.244,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and the intelligence community inspector general,

74
0:03:38.35,000 --> 0:03:42,000
any of whom would have both kept his concerns in classified channels

75
0:03:42.668,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and been happy to address them.

76
0:03:45.299,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(CA and RL speaking at once)

77
0:03:47.576,000 --> 0:03:49,000
He had the option to go to congressional committees,

78
0:03:50.179,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and there are mechanisms to do that that are in place,

79
0:03:53.298,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and so he didn't do any of those things.

80
0:03:55.837,000 --> 0:03:57,000
CA: Now, you had said that

81
0:03:58.827,000 --> 0:04:,000
Ed Snowden had other avenues

82
0:04:01.056,000 --> 0:04:03,000
for raising his concerns.

83
0:04:03.751,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The comeback on that is a couple of things:

84
0:04:07.077,000 --> 0:04:1,000
one, that he certainly believes that as a contractor,

85
0:04:10.887,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the avenues that would have been available to him as an employee weren't available,

86
0:04:14.648,000 --> 0:04:17,000
two, there's a track record of other whistleblowers,

87
0:04:18.079,000 --> 0:04:2,000
like [Thomas Andrews Drake] being treated

88
0:04:20.69,000 --> 0:04:23,000
pretty harshly, by some views,

89
0:04:23.837,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and thirdly, what he was taking on

90
0:04:25.49,000 --> 0:04:28,000
was not one specific flaw that he'd discovered,

91
0:04:28.827,000 --> 0:04:29,000
but programs that had been approved

92
0:04:30.798,000 --> 0:04:32,000
by all three branches of government.

93
0:04:33.739,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I mean, in that circumstance,

94
0:04:36.538,000 --> 0:04:38,000
couldn't you argue that what he did

95
0:04:38.941,000 --> 0:04:4,000
was reasonable?

96
0:04:41.207,000 --> 0:04:43,000
RL: No, I don't agree with that.

97
0:04:43.52,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I think that the —

98
0:04:47.257,000 --> 0:04:49,000
sorry, I'm getting feedback

99
0:04:49.392,000 --> 0:04:52,000
through the microphone there —

100
0:04:52.949,000 --> 0:04:56,000
the actions that he took were inappropriate

101
0:04:57.776,000 --> 0:05:01,000
because of the fact that he put people's lives at risk,

102
0:05:02.551,000 --> 0:05:03,000
basically, in the long run,

103
0:05:04.023,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and I know there's been a lot of talk

104
0:05:05.587,000 --> 0:05:09,000
in public by Mr. Snowden and some of the journalists

105
0:05:10.251,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that say that the things that have been disclosed

106
0:05:13.681,000 --> 0:05:17,000
have not put national security and people at risk,

107
0:05:17.876,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and that is categorically not true.

108
0:05:22.17,000 --> 0:05:23,000
They actually do.

109
0:05:24.077,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I think there's also an amazing arrogance

110
0:05:26.918,000 --> 0:05:3,000
to the idea that he knows better than

111
0:05:31.053,000 --> 0:05:34,000
the framers of the Constitution

112
0:05:34.348,000 --> 0:05:36,000
in how the government should be designed and work

113
0:05:36.727,000 --> 0:05:38,000
for separation of powers

114
0:05:38.869,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and the fact that the executive and the legislative branch

115
0:05:45.316,000 --> 0:05:47,000
have to work together and they have checks and balances on each other,

116
0:05:47.927,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and then the judicial branch,

117
0:05:49.461,000 --> 0:05:5,000
which oversees the entire process.

118
0:05:50.897,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I think that's extremely arrogant on his part.

119
0:05:55.118,000 --> 0:05:57,000
CA: Can you give a specific example

120
0:05:57.424,000 --> 0:06:,000
of how he put people's lives at risk?

121
0:06:00.88,000 --> 0:06:01,000
RL: Yeah, sure.

122
0:06:02.877,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So the things that he's disclosed,

123
0:06:06.271,000 --> 0:06:07,000
the capabilities,

124
0:06:07.786,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and the NSA is a capabilities-based organization,

125
0:06:10.228,000 --> 0:06:13,000
so when we have foreign intelligence targets,

126
0:06:14.102,000 --> 0:06:15,000
legitimate things of interest --

127
0:06:15.733,000 --> 0:06:17,000
like, terrorists is the iconic example,

128
0:06:17.743,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but it includes things like human traffickers,

129
0:06:20.837,000 --> 0:06:21,000
drug traffickers,

130
0:06:22.699,000 --> 0:06:25,000
people who are trying to build advanced weaponry, nuclear weapons,

131
0:06:26.663,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and build delivery systems for those,

132
0:06:28.626,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and nation-states who might be executing aggression against their immediate neighbors,

133
0:06:32.257,000 --> 0:06:34,000
which you may have some visibility

134
0:06:34.851,000 --> 0:06:36,000
into some of that that's going on right now,

135
0:06:37.605,000 --> 0:06:4,000
the capabilities are applied

136
0:06:41.567,000 --> 0:06:46,000
in very discrete and measured and controlled ways.

137
0:06:46.568,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So the unconstrained disclosure of those capabilities

138
0:06:49.356,000 --> 0:06:51,000
means that as adversaries see them

139
0:06:51.64,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and recognize, "Hey, I might be vulnerable to this,"

140
0:06:54.003,000 --> 0:06:55,000
they move away from that,

141
0:06:55.57,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and we have seen targets in terrorism,

142
0:06:58.779,000 --> 0:07:,000
in the nation-state area,

143
0:07:00.911,000 --> 0:07:03,000
in smugglers of various types, and other folks

144
0:07:03.913,000 --> 0:07:04,000
who have, because of the disclosures,

145
0:07:05.866,000 --> 0:07:07,000
moved away from our ability

146
0:07:08.801,000 --> 0:07:1,000
to have insight into what they're doing.

147
0:07:10.889,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The net effect of that is that our people

148
0:07:13.853,000 --> 0:07:14,000
who are overseas in dangerous places,

149
0:07:15.746,000 --> 0:07:16,000
whether they're diplomats or military,

150
0:07:17.61,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and our allies who are in similar situations,

151
0:07:20.201,000 --> 0:07:22,000
are at greater risk because we don't see

152
0:07:23.06,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the threats that are coming their way.

153
0:07:26.011,000 --> 0:07:28,000
CA: So that's a general response saying that

154
0:07:28.07,000 --> 0:07:3,000
because of his revelations,

155
0:07:30.167,000 --> 0:07:32,000
access that you had to certain types of information

156
0:07:33.033,000 --> 0:07:36,000
has been shut down, has been closed down.

157
0:07:36.604,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But the concern is that the nature of that access

158
0:07:40.153,000 --> 0:07:43,000
was not necessarily legitimate in the first place.

159
0:07:43.857,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I mean, describe to us this Bullrun program

160
0:07:46.639,000 --> 0:07:48,000
where it's alleged that the NSA

161
0:07:48.768,000 --> 0:07:5,000
specifically weakened security

162
0:07:51.153,000 --> 0:07:55,000
in order to get the type of access that you've spoken of.

163
0:07:55.722,000 --> 0:08:,000
RL: So there are, when our

164
0:08:00.863,000 --> 0:08:02,000
legitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that I described before,

165
0:08:03.575,000 --> 0:08:06,000
use the global telecommunications system

166
0:08:06.611,000 --> 0:08:08,000
as their communications methodology,

167
0:08:08.694,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and they do, because it's a great system,

168
0:08:10.108,000 --> 0:08:12,000
it's the most complex system ever devised by man,

169
0:08:12.946,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and it is a wonder,

170
0:08:14.593,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and lots of folks in the room there

171
0:08:16.197,000 --> 0:08:18,000
are responsible for the creation

172
0:08:18.548,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and enhancement of that,

173
0:08:19.917,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and it's just a wonderful thing.

174
0:08:22.79,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But it's also used by people who are

175
0:08:25.287,000 --> 0:08:27,000
working against us and our allies.

176
0:08:27.318,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And so if I'm going to pursue them,

177
0:08:29.749,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I need to have the capability

178
0:08:31.484,000 --> 0:08:33,000
to go after them,

179
0:08:33.659,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and again, the controls are in

180
0:08:36.485,000 --> 0:08:38,000
how I apply that capability,

181
0:08:39.006,000 --> 0:08:41,000
not that I have the capability itself.

182
0:08:41.252,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Otherwise, if we could make it so that

183
0:08:43.024,000 --> 0:08:45,000
all the bad guys used one corner of the Internet,

184
0:08:45.21,000 --> 0:08:46,000
we could have a domain, badguy.com.

185
0:08:47.166,000 --> 0:08:48,000
That would be awesome,

186
0:08:48.66,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and we could just concentrate all our efforts there.

187
0:08:50.802,000 --> 0:08:51,000
That's not how it works.

188
0:08:52.134,000 --> 0:08:54,000
They're trying to hide

189
0:08:54.345,000 --> 0:08:55,000
from the government's ability

190
0:08:56.15,000 --> 0:08:59,000
to isolate and interdict their actions,

191
0:08:59.433,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and so we have to swim in that same space.

192
0:09:02.245,000 --> 0:09:03,000
But I will tell you this.

193
0:09:03.847,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So NSA has two missions.

194
0:09:05.326,000 --> 0:09:06,000
One is the Signals Intelligence mission

195
0:09:06.776,000 --> 0:09:09,000
that we've unfortunately read so much about in the press.

196
0:09:10.403,000 --> 0:09:11,000
The other one is the Information Assurance mission,

197
0:09:12.141,000 --> 0:09:14,000
which is to protect the national security systems of the United States,

198
0:09:15.052,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and by that, that's things like

199
0:09:17.02,000 --> 0:09:19,000
the communications that the president uses,

200
0:09:19.036,000 --> 0:09:21,000
the communications that control our nuclear weapons,

201
0:09:21.641,000 --> 0:09:23,000
the communications that our military uses around the world,

202
0:09:23.91,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and the communications that we use with our allies,

203
0:09:26.401,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and that some of our allies themselves use.

204
0:09:28.125,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And so we make recommendations on standards to use,

205
0:09:33.962,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and we use those same standards,

206
0:09:35.789,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and so we are invested

207
0:09:37.667,000 --> 0:09:39,000
in making sure that those communications

208
0:09:39.912,000 --> 0:09:42,000
are secure for their intended purposes.

209
0:09:43.525,000 --> 0:09:44,000
CA: But it sounds like what you're saying is that

210
0:09:45.474,000 --> 0:09:48,000
when it comes to the Internet at large,

211
0:09:49.219,000 --> 0:09:51,000
any strategy is fair game

212
0:09:51.846,000 --> 0:09:53,000
if it improves America's safety.

213
0:09:54.762,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And I think this is partly where there is such

214
0:09:56.82,000 --> 0:09:57,000
a divide of opinion,

215
0:09:58.205,000 --> 0:09:59,000
that there's a lot of people in this room

216
0:09:59.455,000 --> 0:10:,000
and around the world

217
0:10:00.828,000 --> 0:10:01,000
who think very differently about the Internet.

218
0:10:02.478,000 --> 0:10:04,000
They think of it as a momentous

219
0:10:05.465,000 --> 0:10:06,000
invention of humanity,

220
0:10:07.063,000 --> 0:10:1,000
kind of on a par with the Gutenberg press, for example.

221
0:10:10.227,000 --> 0:10:12,000
It's the bringer of knowledge to all.

222
0:10:12.682,000 --> 0:10:13,000
It's the connector of all.

223
0:10:14.386,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And it's viewed in those sort of idealistic terms.

224
0:10:17.771,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And from that lens,

225
0:10:19.344,000 --> 0:10:21,000
what the NSA has done is equivalent to

226
0:10:21.941,000 --> 0:10:23,000
the authorities back in Germany

227
0:10:24.101,000 --> 0:10:26,000
inserting some device into every printing press

228
0:10:26.97,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that would reveal which books people bought

229
0:10:30.511,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and what they read.

230
0:10:32.531,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Can you understand that from that viewpoint,

231
0:10:34.762,000 --> 0:10:38,000
it feels outrageous?

232
0:10:38.967,000 --> 0:10:41,000
RL: I do understand that, and I actually share the view of the utility of the Internet,

233
0:10:42.269,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and I would argue it's bigger than the Internet.

234
0:10:43.971,000 --> 0:10:45,000
It is a global telecommunications system.

235
0:10:46.382,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The Internet is a big chunk of that, but there is a lot more.

236
0:10:48.833,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And I think that people have legitimate concerns

237
0:10:52.176,000 --> 0:10:58,000
about the balance between transparency and secrecy.

238
0:10:58.482,000 --> 0:10:59,000
That's sort of been couched as a balance

239
0:11:00.422,000 --> 0:11:03,000
between privacy and national security.

240
0:11:04.058,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I don't think that's the right framing.

241
0:11:05.478,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I think it really is transparency and secrecy.

242
0:11:07.843,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And so that's the national and international conversation that we're having,

243
0:11:11.402,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and we want to participate in that, and want

244
0:11:12.801,000 --> 0:11:14,000
people to participate in it in an informed way.

245
0:11:15.241,000 --> 0:11:16,000
So there are things,

246
0:11:17.152,000 --> 0:11:18,000
let me talk there a little bit more,

247
0:11:18.602,000 --> 0:11:21,000
there are things that we need to be transparent about:

248
0:11:22.371,000 --> 0:11:24,000
our authorities, our processes,

249
0:11:24.398,000 --> 0:11:26,000
our oversight, who we are.

250
0:11:26.452,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We, NSA, have not done a good job of that,

251
0:11:28.218,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and I think that's part of the reason

252
0:11:29.606,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that this has been so revelational

253
0:11:32.335,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and so sensational in the media.

254
0:11:34.531,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Nobody knew who we were. We were the No Such Agency, the Never Say Anything.

255
0:11:38.657,000 --> 0:11:4,000
There's takeoffs of our logo

256
0:11:41.306,000 --> 0:11:44,000
of an eagle with headphones on around it.

257
0:11:44.325,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And so that's the public characterization.

258
0:11:47.948,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And so we need to be more transparent about those things.

259
0:11:52.284,000 --> 0:11:53,000
What we don't need to be transparent about,

260
0:11:53.702,000 --> 0:11:55,000
because it's bad for the U.S.,

261
0:11:56.04,000 --> 0:11:58,000
it's bad for all those other countries that we work with

262
0:11:58.623,000 --> 0:12:,000
and that we help provide information

263
0:12:00.716,000 --> 0:12:01,000
that helps them secure themselves

264
0:12:02.438,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and their people,

265
0:12:03.947,000 --> 0:12:06,000
it's bad to expose operations and capabilities

266
0:12:07.837,000 --> 0:12:12,000
in a way that allows the people that we're all working against,

267
0:12:13.129,000 --> 0:12:17,000
the generally recognized bad guys,

268
0:12:18.092,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to counter those.

269
0:12:20.392,000 --> 0:12:23,000
CA: But isn't it also bad to deal

270
0:12:23.417,000 --> 0:12:26,000
a kind of body blow to the American companies

271
0:12:26.821,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that have essentially given the world

272
0:12:28.717,000 --> 0:12:33,000
most of the Internet services that matter?

273
0:12:33.897,000 --> 0:12:36,000
RL: It is. It's really the companies are

274
0:12:37.289,000 --> 0:12:4,000
in a tough position, as are we,

275
0:12:40.677,000 --> 0:12:41,000
because the companies,

276
0:12:42.618,000 --> 0:12:44,000
we compel them to provide information,

277
0:12:44.95,000 --> 0:12:45,000
just like every other nation in the world does.

278
0:12:46.933,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Every industrialized nation in the world

279
0:12:50.207,000 --> 0:12:52,000
has a lawful intercept program

280
0:12:52.307,000 --> 0:12:54,000
where they are requiring companies

281
0:12:54.805,000 --> 0:12:55,000
to provide them with information

282
0:12:56.216,000 --> 0:12:57,000
that they need for their security,

283
0:12:57.871,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and the companies that are involved

284
0:13:00.098,000 --> 0:13:01,000
have complied with those programs

285
0:13:01.526,000 --> 0:13:02,000
in the same way that they have to do

286
0:13:03.144,000 --> 0:13:06,000
when they're operating in Russia or the U.K.

287
0:13:06.594,000 --> 0:13:1,000
or China or India or France,

288
0:13:10.88,000 --> 0:13:12,000
any country that you choose to name.

289
0:13:12.898,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And so the fact that these revelations

290
0:13:17.807,000 --> 0:13:19,000
have been broadly characterized as

291
0:13:20.101,000 --> 0:13:21,000
"you can't trust company A because

292
0:13:21.991,000 --> 0:13:24,000
your privacy is suspect with them"

293
0:13:25.506,000 --> 0:13:29,000
is actually only accurate in the sense that

294
0:13:29.547,000 --> 0:13:31,000
it's accurate with every other company in the world

295
0:13:32.283,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that deals with any of those countries in the world.

296
0:13:34.442,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And so it's being picked up by people

297
0:13:36.57,000 --> 0:13:37,000
as a marketing advantage,

298
0:13:38.164,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and it's being marketed that way by several countries,

299
0:13:39.937,000 --> 0:13:4,000
including some of our allied countries,

300
0:13:41.448,000 --> 0:13:42,000
where they are saying,

301
0:13:42.95,000 --> 0:13:43,000
"Hey, you can't trust the U.S.,

302
0:13:44.479,000 --> 0:13:46,000
but you can trust our telecom company,

303
0:13:47.065,000 --> 0:13:48,000
because we're safe."

304
0:13:48.419,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And they're actually using that to counter

305
0:13:50.078,000 --> 0:13:52,000
the very large technological edge

306
0:13:52.396,000 --> 0:13:53,000
that U.S. companies have

307
0:13:54.205,000 --> 0:13:57,000
in areas like the cloud and Internet-based technologies.

308
0:13:58.111,000 --> 0:14:01,000
CA: You're sitting there with the American flag,

309
0:14:01.118,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and the American Constitution guarantees

310
0:14:04.688,000 --> 0:14:06,000
freedom from unreasonable search and seizure.

311
0:14:07.535,000 --> 0:14:08,000
How do you characterize

312
0:14:09.496,000 --> 0:14:13,000
the American citizen's right to privacy?

313
0:14:13.976,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Is there such a right?

314
0:14:16.257,000 --> 0:14:18,000
RL: Yeah, of course there is.

315
0:14:18.993,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And we devote an inordinate amount of time and pressure,

316
0:14:22.036,000 --> 0:14:24,000
inordinate and appropriate, actually I should say,

317
0:14:24.32,000 --> 0:14:26,000
amount of time and effort in order to ensure

318
0:14:26.528,000 --> 0:14:28,000
that we protect that privacy.

319
0:14:28.86,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and beyond that, the privacy of citizens

320
0:14:31.917,000 --> 0:14:34,000
around the world, it's not just Americans.

321
0:14:35.566,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Several things come into play here.

322
0:14:37.466,000 --> 0:14:38,000
First, we're all in the same network.

323
0:14:39.214,000 --> 0:14:4,000
My communications,

324
0:14:40.788,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I'm a user of a particular Internet email service

325
0:14:44.935,000 --> 0:14:47,000
that is the number one email service of choice

326
0:14:48.906,000 --> 0:14:49,000
by terrorists around the world, number one.

327
0:14:50.499,000 --> 0:14:52,000
So I'm there right beside them in email space

328
0:14:53.224,000 --> 0:14:54,000
in the Internet.

329
0:14:55.113,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And so we need to be able to pick that apart

330
0:14:58.705,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and find the information that's relevant.

331
0:15:05.131,000 --> 0:15:08,000
In doing so, we're going to necessarily encounter

332
0:15:08.493,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Americans and innocent foreign citizens

333
0:15:10.561,000 --> 0:15:11,000
who are just going about their business,

334
0:15:12.107,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and so we have procedures in place that shreds that out,

335
0:15:14.805,000 --> 0:15:16,000
that says, when you find that,

336
0:15:17.02,000 --> 0:15:19,000
not if you find it, when you find it, because you're certain to find it,

337
0:15:19.287,000 --> 0:15:2,000
here's how you protect that.

338
0:15:21.07,000 --> 0:15:23,000
These are called minimization procedures.

339
0:15:23.175,000 --> 0:15:25,000
They're approved by the attorney general

340
0:15:25.203,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and constitutionally based.

341
0:15:26.803,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And so we protect those.

342
0:15:29.283,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And then, for people, citizens of the world

343
0:15:33.754,000 --> 0:15:34,000
who are going about their lawful business

344
0:15:35.633,000 --> 0:15:36,000
on a day-to-day basis,

345
0:15:37.34,000 --> 0:15:39,000
the president on his January 17 speech,

346
0:15:39.636,000 --> 0:15:4,000
laid out some additional protections

347
0:15:41.129,000 --> 0:15:43,000
that we are providing to them.

348
0:15:43.188,000 --> 0:15:44,000
So I think absolutely,

349
0:15:45.06,000 --> 0:15:46,000
folks do have a right to privacy,

350
0:15:46.595,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and that we work very hard to make sure

351
0:15:49.214,000 --> 0:15:51,000
that that right to privacy is protected.

352
0:15:52.02,000 --> 0:15:53,000
CA: What about foreigners using

353
0:15:53.756,000 --> 0:15:55,000
American companies' Internet services?

354
0:15:55.906,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Do they have any privacy rights?

355
0:15:59.751,000 --> 0:16:01,000
RL: They do. They do, in the sense of,

356
0:16:02.424,000 --> 0:16:07,000
the only way that we are able to compel

357
0:16:08.164,000 --> 0:16:1,000
one of those companies to provide us information

358
0:16:10.49,000 --> 0:16:13,000
is when it falls into one of three categories:

359
0:16:13.952,000 --> 0:16:16,000
We can identify that this particular person,

360
0:16:17.504,000 --> 0:16:19,000
identified by a selector of some kind,

361
0:16:19.894,000 --> 0:16:22,000
is associated with counterterrorist

362
0:16:23.25,000 --> 0:16:28,000
or proliferation or other foreign intelligence target.

363
0:16:28.499,000 --> 0:16:29,000
CA: Much has been made of the fact that

364
0:16:30.281,000 --> 0:16:32,000
a lot of the information that you've obtained

365
0:16:32.747,000 --> 0:16:34,000
through these programs is essentially metadata.

366
0:16:35.023,000 --> 0:16:37,000
It's not necessarily the actual words

367
0:16:37.318,000 --> 0:16:38,000
that someone has written in an email

368
0:16:38.971,000 --> 0:16:39,000
or given on a phone call.

369
0:16:40.32,000 --> 0:16:44,000
It's who they wrote to and when, and so forth.

370
0:16:44.369,000 --> 0:16:45,000
But it's been argued,

371
0:16:45.905,000 --> 0:16:47,000
and someone here in the audience has talked

372
0:16:48.016,000 --> 0:16:5,000
to a former NSA analyst who said

373
0:16:50.483,000 --> 0:16:52,000
metadata is actually much more invasive

374
0:16:52.87,000 --> 0:16:53,000
than the core data,

375
0:16:54.273,000 --> 0:16:55,000
because in the core data

376
0:16:55.406,000 --> 0:16:58,000
you present yourself as you want to be presented.

377
0:16:58.633,000 --> 0:17:,000
With metadata, who knows what the conclusions are

378
0:17:01.339,000 --> 0:17:02,000
that are drawn?

379
0:17:02.755,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Is there anything to that?

380
0:17:04.761,000 --> 0:17:05,000
RL: I don't really understand that argument.

381
0:17:06.55,000 --> 0:17:08,000
I think that metadata's important for a couple of reasons.

382
0:17:09.45,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Metadata is the information that lets you

383
0:17:13.928,000 --> 0:17:16,000
find connections that people are trying to hide.

384
0:17:17.319,000 --> 0:17:19,000
So when a terrorist is corresponding

385
0:17:19.33,000 --> 0:17:2,000
with somebody else who's not known to us

386
0:17:21.175,000 --> 0:17:23,000
but is engaged in doing or supporting terrorist activity,

387
0:17:23.783,000 --> 0:17:25,000
or someone who's violating international sanctions

388
0:17:26.209,000 --> 0:17:29,000
by providing nuclear weapons-related material

389
0:17:29.286,000 --> 0:17:31,000
to a country like Iran or North Korea,

390
0:17:31.612,000 --> 0:17:34,000
is trying to hide that activity because it's illicit activity.

391
0:17:35.189,000 --> 0:17:37,000
What metadata lets you do is connect that.

392
0:17:37.999,000 --> 0:17:38,000
The alternative to that

393
0:17:39.531,000 --> 0:17:4,000
is one that's much less efficient

394
0:17:41.15,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and much more invasive of privacy,

395
0:17:42.531,000 --> 0:17:45,000
which is gigantic amounts of content collection.

396
0:17:46.367,000 --> 0:17:47,000
So metadata, in that sense,

397
0:17:47.76,000 --> 0:17:49,000
actually is privacy-enhancing.

398
0:17:50.156,000 --> 0:17:52,000
And we don't, contrary to some of the stuff

399
0:17:52.261,000 --> 0:17:53,000
that's been printed,

400
0:17:53.976,000 --> 0:17:55,000
we don't sit there and grind out

401
0:17:56.745,000 --> 0:17:58,000
metadata profiles of average people.

402
0:17:59.582,000 --> 0:18:,000
If you're not connected

403
0:18:01.538,000 --> 0:18:04,000
to one of those valid intelligence targets,

404
0:18:04.59,000 --> 0:18:07,000
you are not of interest to us.

405
0:18:08.003,000 --> 0:18:11,000
CA: So in terms of the threats

406
0:18:11.175,000 --> 0:18:13,000
that face America overall,

407
0:18:13.487,000 --> 0:18:16,000
where would you place terrorism?

408
0:18:16.699,000 --> 0:18:19,000
RL: I think terrorism is still number one.

409
0:18:19.797,000 --> 0:18:22,000
I think that we have never been in a time

410
0:18:23.701,000 --> 0:18:24,000
where there are more places

411
0:18:25.692,000 --> 0:18:27,000
where things are going badly

412
0:18:28.545,000 --> 0:18:31,000
and forming the petri dish in which terrorists

413
0:18:32.446,000 --> 0:18:37,000
take advantage of the lack of governance.

414
0:18:37.756,000 --> 0:18:4,000
An old boss of mine, Tom Fargo, Admiral Fargo,

415
0:18:41.393,000 --> 0:18:43,000
used to describe it as arcs of instability.

416
0:18:43.606,000 --> 0:18:45,000
And so you have a lot of those arcs of instability

417
0:18:45.974,000 --> 0:18:46,000
in the world right now,

418
0:18:47.667,000 --> 0:18:48,000
in places like Syria, where there's a civil war

419
0:18:49.504,000 --> 0:18:51,000
going on and you have massive numbers,

420
0:18:52.214,000 --> 0:18:53,000
thousands and thousands of foreign fighters

421
0:18:53.949,000 --> 0:18:54,000
who are coming into Syria

422
0:18:55.682,000 --> 0:18:56,000
to learn how to be terrorists

423
0:18:57.185,000 --> 0:18:59,000
and practice that activity,

424
0:18:59.286,000 --> 0:19:01,000
and lots of those people are Westerners

425
0:19:01.985,000 --> 0:19:04,000
who hold passports to European countries

426
0:19:05.714,000 --> 0:19:06,000
or in some cases the United States,

427
0:19:07.466,000 --> 0:19:09,000
and so they are basically learning how

428
0:19:09.867,000 --> 0:19:12,000
to do jihad and have expressed intent

429
0:19:13.347,000 --> 0:19:15,000
to go out and do that later on

430
0:19:15.76,000 --> 0:19:16,000
in their home countries.

431
0:19:17.427,000 --> 0:19:18,000
You've got places like Iraq,

432
0:19:18.748,000 --> 0:19:2,000
which is suffering from a high level of sectarian violence,

433
0:19:21.53,000 --> 0:19:23,000
again a breeding ground for terrorism.

434
0:19:24.181,000 --> 0:19:26,000
And you have the activity in the Horn of Africa

435
0:19:26.687,000 --> 0:19:29,000
and the Sahel area of Africa.

436
0:19:29.734,000 --> 0:19:31,000
Again, lots of weak governance

437
0:19:32.262,000 --> 0:19:35,000
which forms a breeding ground for terrorist activity.

438
0:19:36.153,000 --> 0:19:37,000
So I think it's very serious. I think it's number one.

439
0:19:38.147,000 --> 0:19:4,000
I think number two is cyber threat.

440
0:19:40.401,000 --> 0:19:45,000
I think cyber is a threat in three ways:

441
0:19:46.165,000 --> 0:19:49,000
One way, and probably the most common way

442
0:19:49.919,000 --> 0:19:51,000
that people have heard about it,

443
0:19:52.111,000 --> 0:19:54,000
is due to the theft of intellectual property,

444
0:19:54.111,000 --> 0:19:58,000
so basically, foreign countries going in,

445
0:19:58.415,000 --> 0:19:59,000
stealing companies' secrets,

446
0:20:00.292,000 --> 0:20:01,000
and then providing that information

447
0:20:02.29,000 --> 0:20:03,000
to state-owned enterprises

448
0:20:04.027,000 --> 0:20:06,000
or companies connected to the government

449
0:20:06.976,000 --> 0:20:08,000
to help them leapfrog technology

450
0:20:09.479,000 --> 0:20:11,000
or to gain business intelligence

451
0:20:11.554,000 --> 0:20:13,000
that's then used to win contracts overseas.

452
0:20:14.222,000 --> 0:20:17,000
That is a hugely costly set of activities that's going on right now.

453
0:20:17.961,000 --> 0:20:18,000
Several nation-states are doing it.

454
0:20:19.428,000 --> 0:20:22,000
Second is the denial-of-service attacks.

455
0:20:22.653,000 --> 0:20:23,000
You're probably aware that there have been

456
0:20:24.032,000 --> 0:20:25,000
a spate of those directed against

457
0:20:26.003,000 --> 0:20:29,000
the U.S. financial sector since 2012.

458
0:20:29.591,000 --> 0:20:31,000
Again, that's a nation-state who is executing those attacks,

459
0:20:32.208,000 --> 0:20:33,000
and they're doing that

460
0:20:33.281,000 --> 0:20:37,000
as a semi-anonymous way of reprisal.

461
0:20:38.034,000 --> 0:20:39,000
And the last one is destructive attacks,

462
0:20:39.424,000 --> 0:20:4,000
and those are the ones that concern me the most.

463
0:20:40.95,000 --> 0:20:41,000
Those are on the rise.

464
0:20:42.35,000 --> 0:20:45,000
You have the attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012,

465
0:20:45.98,000 --> 0:20:46,000
August of 2012.

466
0:20:47.67,000 --> 0:20:49,000
It took down about 35,000 of their computers

467
0:20:49.955,000 --> 0:20:5,000
with a Wiper-style virus.

468
0:20:51.747,000 --> 0:20:52,000
You had a follow-on a week later

469
0:20:53.66,000 --> 0:20:54,000
to a Qatari company.

470
0:20:55.194,000 --> 0:20:57,000
You had March of 2013,

471
0:20:57.335,000 --> 0:20:59,000
you had a South Korean attack

472
0:21:00.006,000 --> 0:21:02,000
that was attributed in the press to North Korea

473
0:21:02.439,000 --> 0:21:04,000
that took out thousands of computers.

474
0:21:04.494,000 --> 0:21:05,000
Those are on the rise,

475
0:21:05.939,000 --> 0:21:07,000
and we see people expressing interest

476
0:21:08.673,000 --> 0:21:09,000
in those capabilities

477
0:21:09.849,000 --> 0:21:11,000
and a desire to employ them.

478
0:21:11.866,000 --> 0:21:12,000
CA: Okay, so a couple of things here,

479
0:21:13.432,000 --> 0:21:14,000
because this is really the core of this, almost.

480
0:21:15.374,000 --> 0:21:16,000
I mean, first of all,

481
0:21:16.638,000 --> 0:21:17,000
a lot of people who look at risk

482
0:21:18.196,000 --> 0:21:19,000
and look at the numbers

483
0:21:19.413,000 --> 0:21:21,000
don't understand this belief that terrorism

484
0:21:21.673,000 --> 0:21:22,000
is still the number one threat.

485
0:21:23.557,000 --> 0:21:24,000
Apart from September 11,

486
0:21:25.185,000 --> 0:21:27,000
I think the numbers are that in the last 30 or 40 years

487
0:21:27.54,000 --> 0:21:3,000
about 500 Americans have died from terrorism,

488
0:21:30.641,000 --> 0:21:33,000
mostly from homegrown terrorists.

489
0:21:34.624,000 --> 0:21:35,000
The chance in the last few years

490
0:21:36.211,000 --> 0:21:37,000
of being killed by terrorism

491
0:21:37.934,000 --> 0:21:4,000
is far less than the chance of being killed by lightning.

492
0:21:41.918,000 --> 0:21:44,000
I guess you would say that a single nuclear incident

493
0:21:45.324,000 --> 0:21:48,000
or bioterrorism act or something like that

494
0:21:48.65,000 --> 0:21:49,000
would change those numbers.

495
0:21:50.551,000 --> 0:21:52,000
Would that be the point of view?

496
0:21:52.713,000 --> 0:21:53,000
RL: Well, I'd say two things.

497
0:21:53.889,000 --> 0:21:54,000
One is, the reason that there hasn't been

498
0:21:55.815,000 --> 0:21:56,000
a major attack in the United States since 9/11,

499
0:21:57.625,000 --> 0:21:58,000
that is not an accident.

500
0:21:59.181,000 --> 0:22:01,000
That's a lot of hard work that we have done,

501
0:22:01.367,000 --> 0:22:02,000
that other folks

502
0:22:02.748,000 --> 0:22:03,000
in the intelligence community have done,

503
0:22:04.131,000 --> 0:22:05,000
that the military has done,

504
0:22:05.312,000 --> 0:22:07,000
and that our allies around the globe have done.

505
0:22:07.36,000 --> 0:22:09,000
You've heard the numbers about

506
0:22:09.811,000 --> 0:22:11,000
the tip of the iceberg in terms

507
0:22:12.343,000 --> 0:22:14,000
of numbers of terrorist attacks that NSA programs

508
0:22:14.913,000 --> 0:22:16,000
contributed to stopping was 54,

509
0:22:17.672,000 --> 0:22:18,000
25 of those in Europe,

510
0:22:19.494,000 --> 0:22:21,000
and of those 25,

511
0:22:21.624,000 --> 0:22:23,000
18 of them occurred in three countries,

512
0:22:24.229,000 --> 0:22:25,000
some of which are our allies,

513
0:22:26.092,000 --> 0:22:28,000
and some of which are beating the heck out of us

514
0:22:28.291,000 --> 0:22:32,000
over the NSA programs, by the way.

515
0:22:32.768,000 --> 0:22:34,000
So that's not an accident that those things happen.

516
0:22:35.46,000 --> 0:22:37,000
That's hard work. That's us finding intelligence

517
0:22:37.785,000 --> 0:22:38,000
on terrorist activities

518
0:22:39.615,000 --> 0:22:4,000
and interdicting them through one way or another,

519
0:22:41.189,000 --> 0:22:42,000
through law enforcement,

520
0:22:42.52,000 --> 0:22:44,000
through cooperative activities with other countries

521
0:22:45.35,000 --> 0:22:48,000
and sometimes through military action.

522
0:22:48.466,000 --> 0:22:5,000
The other thing I would say is that

523
0:22:51.359,000 --> 0:22:56,000
your idea of nuclear or chem-bio-threat

524
0:22:56.625,000 --> 0:22:57,000
is not at all far-fetched

525
0:22:58.141,000 --> 0:22:59,000
and in fact there are a number of groups

526
0:22:59.879,000 --> 0:23:,000
who have for several years expressed interest

527
0:23:01.766,000 --> 0:23:03,000
and desire in obtaining those capabilities

528
0:23:04.306,000 --> 0:23:05,000
and work towards that.

529
0:23:06.066,000 --> 0:23:07,000
CA: It's also been said that,

530
0:23:07.642,000 --> 0:23:09,000
of those 54 alleged incidents,

531
0:23:10.342,000 --> 0:23:11,000
that as few as zero of them

532
0:23:12.19,000 --> 0:23:13,000
were actually anything to do

533
0:23:13.252,000 --> 0:23:14,000
with these controversial programs

534
0:23:15.099,000 --> 0:23:18,000
that Mr. Snowden revealed,

535
0:23:18.831,000 --> 0:23:21,000
that it was basically through other forms of intelligence,

536
0:23:22.748,000 --> 0:23:24,000
that you're looking for a needle in a haystack,

537
0:23:25.638,000 --> 0:23:26,000
and the effects of these programs,

538
0:23:27.2,000 --> 0:23:28,000
these controversial programs,

539
0:23:28.231,000 --> 0:23:3,000
is just to add hay to the stack,

540
0:23:30.303,000 --> 0:23:31,000
not to really find the needle.

541
0:23:31.883,000 --> 0:23:33,000
The needle was found by other methods.

542
0:23:33.965,000 --> 0:23:37,000
Isn't there something to that?

543
0:23:38.089,000 --> 0:23:4,000
RL: No, there's actually two programs

544
0:23:40.497,000 --> 0:23:42,000
that are typically implicated in that discussion.

545
0:23:42.914,000 --> 0:23:44,000
One is the section 215 program,

546
0:23:45.392,000 --> 0:23:47,000
the U.S. telephony metadata program,

547
0:23:48.37,000 --> 0:23:5,000
and the other one is

548
0:23:50.41,000 --> 0:23:51,000
popularly called the PRISM program,

549
0:23:52.004,000 --> 0:23:55,000
and it's actually section 702 of the FISA Amendment Act.

550
0:23:55.252,000 --> 0:23:59,000
But the 215 program

551
0:23:59.442,000 --> 0:24:,000
is only relevant to threats

552
0:24:01.169,000 --> 0:24:03,000
that are directed against the United States,

553
0:24:03.428,000 --> 0:24:05,000
and there have been a dozen threats

554
0:24:06.328,000 --> 0:24:07,000
where that was implicated.

555
0:24:07.643,000 --> 0:24:1,000
Now what you'll see people say publicly

556
0:24:10.832,000 --> 0:24:12,000
is there is no "but for" case,

557
0:24:12.868,000 --> 0:24:15,000
and so there is no case where, but for that,

558
0:24:16.681,000 --> 0:24:17,000
the threat would have happened.

559
0:24:18.382,000 --> 0:24:22,000
But that actually indicates a lack of understanding

560
0:24:22.589,000 --> 0:24:27,000
of how terrorist investigations actually work.

561
0:24:27.706,000 --> 0:24:28,000
You think about on television,

562
0:24:29.184,000 --> 0:24:3,000
you watch a murder mystery.

563
0:24:30.516,000 --> 0:24:31,000
What do you start with? You start with a body,

564
0:24:32.046,000 --> 0:24:34,000
and then they work their way from there to solve the crime.

565
0:24:34.282,000 --> 0:24:35,000
We're actually starting well before that,

566
0:24:35.813,000 --> 0:24:36,000
hopefully before there are any bodies,

567
0:24:37.314,000 --> 0:24:39,000
and we're trying to build the case for

568
0:24:39.747,000 --> 0:24:41,000
who the people are, what they're trying to do,

569
0:24:42.177,000 --> 0:24:44,000
and that involves massive amounts of information.

570
0:24:45.027,000 --> 0:24:46,000
Think of it is as mosaic,

571
0:24:46.508,000 --> 0:24:48,000
and it's hard to say that any one piece of a mosaic

572
0:24:48.67,000 --> 0:24:5,000
was necessary to building the mosaic,

573
0:24:51.302,000 --> 0:24:52,000
but to build the complete picture,

574
0:24:53.031,000 --> 0:24:54,000
you need to have all the pieces of information.

575
0:24:54.996,000 --> 0:24:57,000
On the other, the non-U.S.-related threats out of those 54,

576
0:24:58.101,000 --> 0:25:01,000
the other 42 of them,

577
0:25:01.29,000 --> 0:25:05,000
the PRISM program was hugely relevant to that,

578
0:25:05.92,000 --> 0:25:07,000
and in fact was material in contributing

579
0:25:08.906,000 --> 0:25:09,000
to stopping those attacks.

580
0:25:10.788,000 --> 0:25:11,000
CA: Snowden said two days ago

581
0:25:12.125,000 --> 0:25:15,000
that terrorism has always been

582
0:25:15.495,000 --> 0:25:17,000
what is called in the intelligence world

583
0:25:17.623,000 --> 0:25:18,000
"a cover for action,"

584
0:25:19.169,000 --> 0:25:2,000
that it's something that,

585
0:25:21.106,000 --> 0:25:22,000
because it invokes such a powerful

586
0:25:22.822,000 --> 0:25:23,000
emotional response in people,

587
0:25:24.661,000 --> 0:25:26,000
it allows the initiation of these programs

588
0:25:27.295,000 --> 0:25:3,000
to achieve powers that an organization like yours

589
0:25:30.856,000 --> 0:25:31,000
couldn't otherwise have.

590
0:25:32.423,000 --> 0:25:35,000
Is there any internal debate about that?

591
0:25:35.875,000 --> 0:25:36,000
RL: Yeah.

592
0:25:37.287,000 --> 0:25:39,000
I mean, we debate these things all the time,

593
0:25:39.287,000 --> 0:25:41,000
and there is discussion that goes on

594
0:25:42.046,000 --> 0:25:43,000
in the executive branch

595
0:25:43.967,000 --> 0:25:45,000
and within NSA itself

596
0:25:46.03,000 --> 0:25:47,000
and the intelligence community about

597
0:25:47.685,000 --> 0:25:48,000
what's right, what's proportionate,

598
0:25:49.045,000 --> 0:25:5,000
what's the correct thing to do.

599
0:25:50.306,000 --> 0:25:51,000
And it's important to note that the programs

600
0:25:51.884,000 --> 0:25:52,000
that we're talking about

601
0:25:53.231,000 --> 0:25:56,000
were all authorized by two different presidents,

602
0:25:56.633,000 --> 0:25:57,000
two different political parties,

603
0:25:58.378,000 --> 0:26:,000
by Congress twice,

604
0:26:00.513,000 --> 0:26:03,000
and by federal judges 16 different times,

605
0:26:04.349,000 --> 0:26:08,000
and so this is not NSA running off

606
0:26:09.061,000 --> 0:26:1,000
and doing its own thing.

607
0:26:10.524,000 --> 0:26:12,000
This is a legitimate activity

608
0:26:12.972,000 --> 0:26:14,000
of the United States foreign government

609
0:26:15.49,000 --> 0:26:17,000
that was agreed to by all the branches

610
0:26:17.665,000 --> 0:26:18,000
of the United States government,

611
0:26:19.649,000 --> 0:26:22,000
and President Madison would have been proud.

612
0:26:22.698,000 --> 0:26:26,000
CA: And yet, when congressmen discovered

613
0:26:26.787,000 --> 0:26:28,000
what was actually being done with that authorization,

614
0:26:29.017,000 --> 0:26:31,000
many of them were completely shocked.

615
0:26:31.886,000 --> 0:26:34,000
Or do you think that is not a legitimate reaction,

616
0:26:35.232,000 --> 0:26:37,000
that it's only because it's now come out publicly,

617
0:26:37.337,000 --> 0:26:4,000
that they really knew exactly what you were doing

618
0:26:40.439,000 --> 0:26:42,000
with the powers they had granted you?

619
0:26:42.775,000 --> 0:26:43,000
RL: Congress is a big body.

620
0:26:44.449,000 --> 0:26:45,000
There's 535 of them,

621
0:26:46.426,000 --> 0:26:48,000
and they change out frequently,

622
0:26:48.567,000 --> 0:26:49,000
in the case of the House, every two years,

623
0:26:50.425,000 --> 0:26:53,000
and I think that the NSA provided

624
0:26:54.201,000 --> 0:26:57,000
all the relevant information to our oversight committees,

625
0:26:57.338,000 --> 0:26:59,000
and then the dissemination of that information

626
0:26:59.616,000 --> 0:27:,000
by the oversight committees throughout Congress

627
0:27:01.515,000 --> 0:27:03,000
is something that they manage.

628
0:27:04.149,000 --> 0:27:08,000
I think I would say that Congress members

629
0:27:09.005,000 --> 0:27:12,000
had the opportunity to make themselves aware,

630
0:27:12.836,000 --> 0:27:13,000
and in fact a significant number of them,

631
0:27:14.705,000 --> 0:27:17,000
the ones who are assigned oversight responsibility,

632
0:27:18.163,000 --> 0:27:19,000
did have the ability to do that.

633
0:27:19.337,000 --> 0:27:22,000
And you've actually had the chairs of those committees say that in public.

634
0:27:23.275,000 --> 0:27:24,000
CA: Now, you mentioned the threat of cyberattacks,

635
0:27:24.832,000 --> 0:27:26,000
and I don't think anyone in this room would disagree

636
0:27:26.999,000 --> 0:27:27,000
that that is a huge concern,

637
0:27:28.889,000 --> 0:27:29,000
but do you accept that there's a tradeoff

638
0:27:30.723,000 --> 0:27:32,000
between offensive and defensive strategies,

639
0:27:33.134,000 --> 0:27:35,000
and that it's possible that the very measures taken

640
0:27:35.959,000 --> 0:27:37,000
to, "weaken encryption,"

641
0:27:38.628,000 --> 0:27:4,000
and allow yourself to find the bad guys,

642
0:27:40.781,000 --> 0:27:44,000
might also open the door to forms of cyberattack?

643
0:27:45.054,000 --> 0:27:47,000
RL: So I think two things.

644
0:27:47.897,000 --> 0:27:5,000
One is, you said weaken encryption. I didn't.

645
0:27:51.744,000 --> 0:27:56,000
And the other one is that

646
0:27:56.87,000 --> 0:27:58,000
the NSA has both of those missions,

647
0:27:59.646,000 --> 0:28:01,000
and we are heavily biased towards defense,

648
0:28:01.927,000 --> 0:28:04,000
and, actually, the vulnerabilities that we find

649
0:28:05.444,000 --> 0:28:07,000
in the overwhelming majority of cases,

650
0:28:07.545,000 --> 0:28:09,000
we disclose to the people who are responsible

651
0:28:10.318,000 --> 0:28:13,000
for manufacturing or developing those products.

652
0:28:13.681,000 --> 0:28:14,000
We have a great track record of that,

653
0:28:15.064,000 --> 0:28:16,000
and we're actually working on a proposal right now

654
0:28:17.05,000 --> 0:28:2,000
to be transparent and to publish transparency reports

655
0:28:20.22,000 --> 0:28:22,000
in the same way that the Internet companies

656
0:28:23.106,000 --> 0:28:26,000
are being allowed to publish transparency reports for them.

657
0:28:26.973,000 --> 0:28:27,000
We want to be more transparent about that.

658
0:28:28.971,000 --> 0:28:31,000
So again, we eat our own dog food.

659
0:28:32.1,000 --> 0:28:34,000
We use the standards, we use the products

660
0:28:34.353,000 --> 0:28:36,000
that we recommend,

661
0:28:37.008,000 --> 0:28:39,000
and so it's in our interest

662
0:28:39.303,000 --> 0:28:41,000
to keep our communications protected

663
0:28:41.941,000 --> 0:28:44,000
in the same way that other people's need to be.

664
0:28:45.745,000 --> 0:28:48,000
CA: Edward Snowden,

665
0:28:48.935,000 --> 0:28:52,000
when, after his talk, was wandering the halls here

666
0:28:53.363,000 --> 0:28:54,000
in the bot,

667
0:28:54.608,000 --> 0:28:56,000
and I heard him say to a couple of people,

668
0:28:56.796,000 --> 0:28:57,000
they asked him about what he thought

669
0:28:58.413,000 --> 0:28:59,000
of the NSA overall,

670
0:29:00.006,000 --> 0:29:02,000
and he was very complimentary about the people

671
0:29:02.779,000 --> 0:29:04,000
who work with you,

672
0:29:04.8,000 --> 0:29:07,000
said that it's a really

673
0:29:08.723,000 --> 0:29:09,000
impassioned group of employees

674
0:29:10.683,000 --> 0:29:12,000
who are seeking to do the right thing,

675
0:29:13.132,000 --> 0:29:15,000
and that the problems have come from

676
0:29:16.086,000 --> 0:29:19,000
just some badly conceived policies.

677
0:29:19.205,000 --> 0:29:23,000
He came over certainly very reasonably and calmly.

678
0:29:23.65,000 --> 0:29:25,000
He didn't come over like a crazy man.

679
0:29:25.825,000 --> 0:29:26,000
Would you accept that at least,

680
0:29:27.795,000 --> 0:29:3,000
even if you disagree with how he did it,

681
0:29:30.811,000 --> 0:29:34,000
that he has opened a debate that matters?

682
0:29:34.835,000 --> 0:29:36,000
RL: So I think that the discussion

683
0:29:37.233,000 --> 0:29:38,000
is an important one to have.

684
0:29:39.097,000 --> 0:29:42,000
I do not like the way that he did it.

685
0:29:42.473,000 --> 0:29:44,000
I think there were a number of other ways

686
0:29:44.478,000 --> 0:29:45,000
that he could have done that

687
0:29:45.94,000 --> 0:29:48,000
that would have not endangered our people

688
0:29:49.236,000 --> 0:29:51,000
and the people of other nations

689
0:29:51.884,000 --> 0:29:53,000
through losing visibility

690
0:29:53.995,000 --> 0:29:55,000
into what our adversaries are doing.

691
0:29:56.726,000 --> 0:29:58,000
But I do think it's an important conversation.

692
0:29:59.412,000 --> 0:30:,000
CA: It's been reported that there's

693
0:30:00.951,000 --> 0:30:02,000
almost a difference of opinion

694
0:30:03.06,000 --> 0:30:04,000
with you and your colleagues

695
0:30:04.531,000 --> 0:30:06,000
over any scenario in which

696
0:30:06.584,000 --> 0:30:08,000
he might be offered an amnesty deal.

697
0:30:09.187,000 --> 0:30:11,000
I think your boss, General Keith Alexander,

698
0:30:11.898,000 --> 0:30:12,000
has said that that would be a terrible example

699
0:30:13.884,000 --> 0:30:14,000
for others;

700
0:30:15.349,000 --> 0:30:16,000
you can't negotiate with someone

701
0:30:17.006,000 --> 0:30:19,000
who's broken the law in that way.

702
0:30:19.014,000 --> 0:30:21,000
But you've been quoted as saying that,

703
0:30:21.023,000 --> 0:30:24,000
if Snowden could prove that he was surrendering

704
0:30:24.231,000 --> 0:30:25,000
all undisclosed documents,

705
0:30:26.027,000 --> 0:30:28,000
that a deal maybe should be considered.

706
0:30:28.266,000 --> 0:30:3,000
Do you still think that?

707
0:30:31.236,000 --> 0:30:32,000
RL: Yeah, so actually,

708
0:30:32.754,000 --> 0:30:34,000
this is my favorite thing about that "60 Minutes" interview

709
0:30:35.337,000 --> 0:30:36,000
was all the misquotes that came from that.

710
0:30:37.049,000 --> 0:30:39,000
What I actually said, in response to a question about,

711
0:30:39.964,000 --> 0:30:4,000
would you entertain any discussions

712
0:30:41.776,000 --> 0:30:47,000
of mitigating action against Snowden,

713
0:30:48.161,000 --> 0:30:49,000
I said, yeah, it's worth a conversation.

714
0:30:49.993,000 --> 0:30:5,000
This is something that the attorney general

715
0:30:51.628,000 --> 0:30:52,000
of the United States and the president also

716
0:30:53.558,000 --> 0:30:54,000
actually have both talked about this,

717
0:30:55.096,000 --> 0:30:56,000
and I defer to the attorney general,

718
0:30:56.465,000 --> 0:30:57,000
because this is his lane.

719
0:30:58.012,000 --> 0:31:,000
But there is a strong tradition

720
0:31:00.521,000 --> 0:31:03,000
in American jurisprudence

721
0:31:03.713,000 --> 0:31:07,000
of having discussions with people

722
0:31:08.288,000 --> 0:31:09,000
who have been charged with crimes in order to,

723
0:31:10.132,000 --> 0:31:11,000
if it benefits the government,

724
0:31:11.648,000 --> 0:31:13,000
to get something out of that,

725
0:31:14.026,000 --> 0:31:16,000
that there's always room for that kind of discussion.

726
0:31:16.66,000 --> 0:31:17,000
So I'm not presupposing any outcome,

727
0:31:18.349,000 --> 0:31:21,000
but there is always room for discussion.

728
0:31:22.085,000 --> 0:31:23,000
CA: To a lay person it seems like

729
0:31:23.685,000 --> 0:31:26,000
he has certain things to offer the U.S.,

730
0:31:27.053,000 --> 0:31:28,000
the government, you, others,

731
0:31:28.792,000 --> 0:31:29,000
in terms of putting things right

732
0:31:30.473,000 --> 0:31:32,000
and helping figure out a smarter policy,

733
0:31:32.531,000 --> 0:31:37,000
a smarter way forward for the future.

734
0:31:38.988,000 --> 0:31:4,000
Do you see, has that kind of possibility

735
0:31:41.061,000 --> 0:31:43,000
been entertained at all?

736
0:31:43.459,000 --> 0:31:44,000
RL: So that's out of my lane.

737
0:31:45.097,000 --> 0:31:46,000
That's not an NSA thing.

738
0:31:46.626,000 --> 0:31:48,000
That would be a Department of Justice

739
0:31:48.833,000 --> 0:31:5,000
sort of discussion.

740
0:31:51.33,000 --> 0:31:54,000
I'll defer to them.

741
0:31:54.626,000 --> 0:31:56,000
CA: Rick, when Ed Snowden ended his talk,

742
0:31:57.591,000 --> 0:32:,000
I offered him the chance to share an idea worth spreading.

743
0:32:01.336,000 --> 0:32:02,000
What would be your idea worth spreading

744
0:32:02.989,000 --> 0:32:04,000
for this group?

745
0:32:05.271,000 --> 0:32:06,000
RL: So I think, learn the facts.

746
0:32:07.263,000 --> 0:32:09,000
This is a really important conversation,

747
0:32:09.879,000 --> 0:32:11,000
and it impacts, it's not just NSA,

748
0:32:11.955,000 --> 0:32:12,000
it's not just the government,

749
0:32:13.153,000 --> 0:32:15,000
it's you, it's the Internet companies.

750
0:32:16.061,000 --> 0:32:19,000
The issue of privacy and personal data

751
0:32:19.179,000 --> 0:32:2,000
is much bigger than just the government,

752
0:32:20.756,000 --> 0:32:21,000
and so learn the facts.

753
0:32:22.667,000 --> 0:32:23,000
Don't rely on headlines,

754
0:32:24.263,000 --> 0:32:25,000
don't rely on sound bites,

755
0:32:25.939,000 --> 0:32:27,000
don't rely on one-sided conversations.

756
0:32:28.419,000 --> 0:32:31,000
So that's the idea, I think, worth spreading.

757
0:32:31.568,000 --> 0:32:34,000
We have a sign, a badge tab,

758
0:32:34.961,000 --> 0:32:35,000
we wear badges at work with lanyards,

759
0:32:36.85,000 --> 0:32:37,000
and if I could make a plug,

760
0:32:38.263,000 --> 0:32:4,000
my badge lanyard at work says, "Dallas Cowboys."

761
0:32:41.01,000 --> 0:32:44,000
Go Dallas.

762
0:32:44.507,000 --> 0:32:46,000
I've just alienated half the audience, I know.

763
0:32:47.173,000 --> 0:32:5,000
So the lanyard that our people

764
0:32:51.069,000 --> 0:32:52,000
who work in the organization

765
0:32:52.854,000 --> 0:32:54,000
that does our crypto-analytic work

766
0:32:55.274,000 --> 0:32:56,000
have a tab that says, "Look at the data."

767
0:32:57.215,000 --> 0:32:58,000
So that's the idea worth spreading.

768
0:32:58.751,000 --> 0:33:,000
Look at the data.

769
0:33:01,000 --> 0:33:03,000
CA: Rick, it took a certain amount of courage,

770
0:33:03.992,000 --> 0:33:05,000
I think, actually, to come and speak openly

771
0:33:06.607,000 --> 0:33:07,000
to this group.

772
0:33:07.861,000 --> 0:33:09,000
It's not something the NSA has done a lot of in the past,

773
0:33:10.528,000 --> 0:33:13,000
and plus the technology has been challenging.

774
0:33:13.623,000 --> 0:33:14,000
We truly appreciate you doing that

775
0:33:15.404,000 --> 0:33:17,000
and sharing in this very important conversation.

776
0:33:17.817,000 --> 0:33:19,000
Thank you so much.

777
0:33:19.958,000 --> 0:33:2,000
RL: Thanks, Chris.

778
0:33:21.897,000 --> 0:33:28,000
(Applause)

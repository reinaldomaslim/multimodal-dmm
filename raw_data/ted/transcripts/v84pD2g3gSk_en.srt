0:00:12.378,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Hi.

2
0:00:13.645,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Today I'm going to share my personal journey

3
0:00:16.837,000 --> 0:00:2,000
with female genital mutilation, FGM.

4
0:00:21.838,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Feel free to cry, laugh, cross your legs,

5
0:00:25.557,000 --> 0:00:27,000
or do anything your body feels like doing.

6
0:00:27.828,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I'm not going to name the things your body does.

7
0:00:31.086,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I was born in Sierra Leone.

8
0:00:33.302,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Did anybody watch "Blood Diamond"?

9
0:00:36.993,000 --> 0:00:37,000
If you have any thoughts --

10
0:00:38.888,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I don't have any diamonds on me, by the way.

11
0:00:42.096,000 --> 0:00:45,000
If you have heard of Ebola, well, that's in Sierra Leone as well.

12
0:00:45.355,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I don't have Ebola. You're all safe.

13
0:00:47.113,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Don't rush to the door.

14
0:00:48.527,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Be seated. You're fine. I was checked before I got here.

15
0:00:53.397,000 --> 0:00:55,000
My grandfather had three wives.

16
0:00:56.246,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Don't ask me why a man needs more than one wife.

17
0:00:58.575,000 --> 0:01:,000
Men, do you need more than one wife?

18
0:01:00.584,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I don't think so. There you go.

19
0:01:02.292,000 --> 0:01:05,000
He was looking for a heart attack, that's what I say.

20
0:01:05.926,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Oh yeah, he was.

21
0:01:08.329,000 --> 0:01:12,000
When I was three, war broke out in Sierra Leone in 1991.

22
0:01:12.452,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I remember literally going to bed one night, everything was good.

23
0:01:16.428,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The next day, I woke up,

24
0:01:18.14,000 --> 0:01:19,000
bombs were dropping everywhere,

25
0:01:20.081,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and people were trying to kill me and my family.

26
0:01:22.662,000 --> 0:01:26,000
We escaped the war and ended up in Gambia, in West Africa.

27
0:01:27.465,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Ebola is there as well. Stay away from it.

28
0:01:31.315,000 --> 0:01:32,000
While we were there as refugees,

29
0:01:32.868,000 --> 0:01:35,000
we didn't know what was going to become of us.

30
0:01:36.684,000 --> 0:01:37,000
My mom applied for refugee status.

31
0:01:38.573,000 --> 0:01:4,000
She's a wonderful, smart woman, that one,

32
0:01:41.304,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and we were lucky.

33
0:01:42.583,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Australia said, we will take you in.

34
0:01:45.393,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Good job, Aussies.

35
0:01:48.089,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Before we were meant to travel,

36
0:01:51.35,000 --> 0:01:52,000
my mom came home one day, and said,

37
0:01:53.192,000 --> 0:01:56,000
"We're going on a little holiday, a little trip."

38
0:01:56.37,000 --> 0:01:57,000
She put us in a car,

39
0:01:57.668,000 --> 0:02:,000
and we drove for hours and ended up in a bush

40
0:02:01.273,000 --> 0:02:03,000
in a remote area in Gambia.

41
0:02:05.568,000 --> 0:02:07,000
In this bush, we found two huts.

42
0:02:08.447,000 --> 0:02:11,000
An old lady came towards us.

43
0:02:11.899,000 --> 0:02:13,000
She was ethnic-looking, very old.

44
0:02:14.646,000 --> 0:02:16,000
She had a chat with my mom, and went back.

45
0:02:17.68,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Then she came back and walked away from us into a second hut.

46
0:02:22.188,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I'm standing there thinking,

47
0:02:23.552,000 --> 0:02:25,000
"This is very confusing. I don't know what's going on."

48
0:02:26.221,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The next thing I knew,

49
0:02:28.023,000 --> 0:02:29,000
my mom took me into this hut.

50
0:02:31.329,000 --> 0:02:32,000
She took my clothes off,

51
0:02:33.065,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and then she pinned me down on the floor.

52
0:02:37.347,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I struggled and tried to get her off me, but I couldn't.

53
0:02:40.935,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Then the old lady came towards me with a rusty-looking knife,

54
0:02:44.53,000 --> 0:02:45,000
one of the sharp knives,

55
0:02:46.41,000 --> 0:02:5,000
orange-looking, has never seen water or sunlight before.

56
0:02:50.613,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I thought she was going to slaughter me,

57
0:02:52.317,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but she didn't.

58
0:02:54.344,000 --> 0:02:57,000
She slowly slid down my body

59
0:02:57.486,000 --> 0:03:,000
and ended up where my vagina is.

60
0:03:01.703,000 --> 0:03:05,000
She took hold of what I now know to be my clitoris,

61
0:03:06.969,000 --> 0:03:12,000
she took that rusty knife, and started cutting away, inch by inch.

62
0:03:14.729,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I screamed, I cried,

63
0:03:19.056,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and asked my mom to get off me so this pain will stop,

64
0:03:23.747,000 --> 0:03:26,000
but all she did was say, "Be quiet."

65
0:03:26.928,000 --> 0:03:32,000
This old lady sawed away at my flesh for what felt like forever,

66
0:03:32.956,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and then when she was done,

67
0:03:35.019,000 --> 0:03:38,000
she threw that piece of flesh across the floor

68
0:03:38.834,000 --> 0:03:42,000
as if it was the most disgusting thing she's ever touched.

69
0:03:43.46,000 --> 0:03:46,000
They both got off me, and left me there bleeding,

70
0:03:46.966,000 --> 0:03:51,000
crying, and confused as to what just happened.

71
0:03:53.703,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We never talked about this again.

72
0:03:55.805,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Very soon, we found that we were coming to Australia,

73
0:03:59.28,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and this is when you had the Sydney Olympics at the time,

74
0:04:02.015,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and people said we were going to the end of the world,

75
0:04:04.572,000 --> 0:04:06,000
there was nowhere else to go after Australia.

76
0:04:06.669,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Yeah, that comforted us a bit.

77
0:04:09.294,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It took us three days to get here.

78
0:04:11.607,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We went to Senegal, then France, and then Singapore.

79
0:04:16.335,000 --> 0:04:18,000
We went to the bathroom to wash our hands.

80
0:04:19.144,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We spent 15 minutes opening the tap like this.

81
0:04:23.864,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Then somebody came in,

82
0:04:25.651,000 --> 0:04:27,000
slid their hand under and water came out,

83
0:04:27.748,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and we thought, is this what we're in for?

84
0:04:30.255,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Like, seriously.

85
0:04:32.833,000 --> 0:04:34,000
We got to Adelaide, small place,

86
0:04:35.641,000 --> 0:04:38,000
where literally they dumped us in Adelaide, that's what I would say.

87
0:04:38.968,000 --> 0:04:39,000
They dumped us there.

88
0:04:40.407,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We were very grateful.

89
0:04:42.015,000 --> 0:04:43,000
We settled and we liked it.

90
0:04:43.678,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We were like, "We're home, we're here."

91
0:04:45.937,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Then somebody took us to Rundle Mall.

92
0:04:48.571,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Adelaide has only one mall.

93
0:04:49.88,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's this small place.

94
0:04:53.106,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And we saw a lot of Asian people.

95
0:04:55.028,000 --> 0:04:57,000
My mom said all of a sudden, panicking,

96
0:04:57.23,000 --> 0:05:02,000
"You brought us to the wrong place. You must take us back to Australia."

97
0:05:03.73,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Yeah. It had to be explained to her that there were a lot of Asians in Australia

98
0:05:08.851,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and we were in the right place.

99
0:05:10.509,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So fine, it's all good.

100
0:05:13.321,000 --> 0:05:14,000
My mom then had this brilliant idea

101
0:05:15.166,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that I should go to a girls school because they were less racist.

102
0:05:18.482,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I don't know where she read that publication. (Laughter)

103
0:05:21.693,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Never found evidence of it to this day.

104
0:05:25.29,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Six hundred white kids, and I was the only black child there.

105
0:05:29.046,000 --> 0:05:32,000
No, I was the only person with a bit of a color on me.

106
0:05:32.112,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Let me say that. Chocolate color.

107
0:05:35.444,000 --> 0:05:37,000
There were no Asians, no indigenous.

108
0:05:38.055,000 --> 0:05:39,000
All we had was some tan girls,

109
0:05:39.782,000 --> 0:05:41,000
girls who felt the need to be under the sun.

110
0:05:41.899,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It wasn't the same as my chocolate, though. Not the same.

111
0:05:45.684,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Settling in Australia was quite hard,

112
0:05:48.382,000 --> 0:05:51,000
but it became harder when I started volunteering for an organization

113
0:05:51.7,000 --> 0:05:53,000
called Women's Health Statewide,

114
0:05:55.552,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and I joined their female genital mutilation program

115
0:05:58.411,000 --> 0:06:01,000
without any awareness of what this program was actually about,

116
0:06:02.161,000 --> 0:06:04,000
or that it related to me in any way.

117
0:06:04.616,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I spent months educating nurses and doctors

118
0:06:07.566,000 --> 0:06:09,000
about what female genital mutilation was

119
0:06:10.103,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and where it was practiced:

120
0:06:11.592,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and now, Australia and London and America,

121
0:06:16.879,000 --> 0:06:19,000
because, as we all know, we live in a multicultural society,

122
0:06:20.362,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and people who come from those backgrounds come with their culture,

123
0:06:24.765,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and sometimes they have cultural practices that we may not agree with,

124
0:06:30.47,000 --> 0:06:32,000
but they continue to practice them.

125
0:06:33.741,000 --> 0:06:34,000
One day, I was looking at the chart

126
0:06:35.662,000 --> 0:06:38,000
of the different types of female genital mutilation,

127
0:06:38.984,000 --> 0:06:4,000
FGM, I will just say FGM for short.

128
0:06:41.441,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Type I is when they cut off the hood.

129
0:06:44.609,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Type II is when they cut off the whole clitoris

130
0:06:47.877,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and some of your labia majora, or your outer lips,

131
0:06:52.002,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and Type III is when they cut off the whole clitoris

132
0:06:54.739,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and then they sew you up

133
0:06:56.584,000 --> 0:07:,000
so you only have a little hole to pee and have your period.

134
0:07:00.694,000 --> 0:07:02,000
My eyes went onto Type II.

135
0:07:03.016,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Before all of this, I pretty much had amnesia.

136
0:07:05.306,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I was in so much shock and traumatized by what had happened,

137
0:07:08.733,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I didn't remember any of it.

138
0:07:10.864,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Yes, I was aware something bad happened to me,

139
0:07:13.139,000 --> 0:07:15,000
but I had no recollection of what had happened.

140
0:07:15.351,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I knew I had a scar down there,

141
0:07:17.312,000 --> 0:07:19,000
but I thought everybody had a scar down there.

142
0:07:19.455,000 --> 0:07:2,000
This had happened to everybody else.

143
0:07:21.188,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But when I looked at Type II, it all came back to me.

144
0:07:25.397,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I remembered what was done to me.

145
0:07:27.733,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I remembered being in that hut

146
0:07:29.74,000 --> 0:07:32,000
with that old lady and my mom holding me down.

147
0:07:34.809,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Words cannot express the pain I felt,

148
0:07:39.214,000 --> 0:07:41,000
the confusion that I felt,

149
0:07:42.191,000 --> 0:07:46,000
because now I realized that what was done to me was a terrible thing

150
0:07:46.993,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that in this society was called barbaric,

151
0:07:49.977,000 --> 0:07:5,000
it was called mutilation.

152
0:07:51.944,000 --> 0:07:53,000
My mother had said it was called circumcision,

153
0:07:54.107,000 --> 0:07:56,000
but here it was mutilation.

154
0:07:56.327,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I was thinking, I'm mutilated? I'm a mutilated person.

155
0:07:59.384,000 --> 0:08:,000
Oh my God.

156
0:08:01.114,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And then the anger came.

157
0:08:03.002,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I was a black angry woman. (Laughter)

158
0:08:07.002,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Oh yeah.

159
0:08:08.379,000 --> 0:08:1,000
A little one, but angry nevertheless.

160
0:08:11.994,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I went home and said to my mom,

161
0:08:15.72,000 --> 0:08:16,000
"You did something."

162
0:08:17.665,000 --> 0:08:19,000
This is not the African thing to do, pointing at your mother,

163
0:08:20.551,000 --> 0:08:22,000
but hey, I was ready for any consequences.

164
0:08:22.762,000 --> 0:08:24,000
"You did something to me."

165
0:08:24.892,000 --> 0:08:26,000
She's like, "What are you talking about, Khadija?"

166
0:08:27.25,000 --> 0:08:28,000
She's used to me mouthing off.

167
0:08:28.936,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I'm like, "Those years ago, You circumcised me.

168
0:08:33.111,000 --> 0:08:36,000
You cut away something that belonged to me."

169
0:08:36.594,000 --> 0:08:37,000
She said, "Yes, I did.

170
0:08:38.414,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I did it for your own good.

171
0:08:43.144,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It was in your best interest.

172
0:08:45.232,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Your grandmother did it to me, and I did it to you.

173
0:08:48.417,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It's made you a woman."

174
0:08:50.368,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I'm like, "How?"

175
0:08:52.12,000 --> 0:08:54,000
She said, "You're empowered, Khadija.

176
0:08:54.206,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Do you get itchy down there?"

177
0:08:56.023,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I'm like, "No, why would I get itchy down there?"

178
0:08:58.341,000 --> 0:09:,000
She said, "Well, if you were not circumcised,

179
0:09:01.02,000 --> 0:09:03,000
you would get itchy down there.

180
0:09:03.179,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Women who are not circumcised get itchy all the time.

181
0:09:06.314,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Then they sleep around with everybody.

182
0:09:09.373,000 --> 0:09:11,000
You are not going to sleep around with anybody."

183
0:09:12.185,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And I thought,

184
0:09:13.919,000 --> 0:09:18,000
her definition of empowerment was very strange. (Laughter)

185
0:09:20.827,000 --> 0:09:22,000
That was the end of our first conversation.

186
0:09:23.078,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I went back to school.

187
0:09:24.389,000 --> 0:09:27,000
These were the days when we had Dolly and Girlfriend magazines.

188
0:09:27.885,000 --> 0:09:31,000
There was always the sealed section. Anybody remember those sealed sections?

189
0:09:32.152,000 --> 0:09:34,000
The naughty bits, you know?

190
0:09:34.226,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Oh yeah, I love those. (Laughter)

191
0:09:37.101,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Anyway, there was always an article about pleasure

192
0:09:40.694,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and relationships and, of course, sex.

193
0:09:43.96,000 --> 0:09:47,000
But it always assumed that you had a clitoris, though,

194
0:09:47.966,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and I thought, this doesn't fit me.

195
0:09:51.649,000 --> 0:09:53,000
This doesn't talk about people like me.

196
0:09:54.467,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I don't have a clitoris.

197
0:09:56.12,000 --> 0:10:,000
I watched TV and those women would moan like, "Oh! Oh!"

198
0:10:00.272,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I was like, these people and their damned clitoris.

199
0:10:03.275,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Laughter)

200
0:10:04.958,000 --> 0:10:08,000
What is a woman without a clitoris supposed to do with her life?

201
0:10:08.991,000 --> 0:10:09,000
That's what I want to know.

202
0:10:10.524,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I want to do that too -- "Oh! Oh!" and all of that.

203
0:10:14.394,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Didn't happen.

204
0:10:16.072,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So I came home once again and said to my mom,

205
0:10:19.157,000 --> 0:10:23,000
"Dolly and Girlfriend said I deserve pleasure,

206
0:10:23.653,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that I should be having orgasms,

207
0:10:25.603,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and that white men should figure out how to find the clitoris."

208
0:10:30.248,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Apparently, white men have a problem finding the clitoris.

209
0:10:33.504,000 --> 0:10:34,000
(Laughter)

210
0:10:35.41,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Just saying, it wasn't me. It was Dolly that said that.

211
0:10:40.017,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And I thought to myself, I had an inner joke in my head

212
0:10:43.608,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that said, "I will marry a white man.

213
0:10:46.719,000 --> 0:10:49,000
He won't have that problem with me." (Laughter)

214
0:10:50.3,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So I said to my mom,

215
0:10:51.836,000 --> 0:10:58,000
"Dolly and Girlfriend said I deserve pleasure, and do you know

216
0:10:58.935,000 --> 0:11:01,000
what you have taken away from me, what you have denied me?

217
0:11:02.72,000 --> 0:11:05,000
You have invaded me in the most sacred way.

218
0:11:05.893,000 --> 0:11:06,000
I want pleasure.

219
0:11:07.446,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I want to get horny, dammit, as well."

220
0:11:10.751,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And she said to me, "Who is Dolly and Girlfriend?

221
0:11:13.469,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Are they your new friends, Khadija?"

222
0:11:15.929,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I was like, "No, they're not. That's a magazine, mom, a magazine."

223
0:11:19.784,000 --> 0:11:2,000
She didn't get it.

224
0:11:21.399,000 --> 0:11:23,000
We came from two different worlds.

225
0:11:23.507,000 --> 0:11:26,000
When she was growing up, not having a clitoris was the norm.

226
0:11:27.112,000 --> 0:11:29,000
It was celebrated.

227
0:11:29.786,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I was an African Australian girl.

228
0:11:32.153,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I lived in a society that was very clitoris-centric.

229
0:11:35.962,000 --> 0:11:39,000
It was all about the damn clitoris!

230
0:11:40.193,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And I didn't have one!

231
0:11:41.912,000 --> 0:11:44,000
That pissed me off.

232
0:11:45.466,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So once I went through this strange phase of anger

233
0:11:49.27,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and pain and confusion,

234
0:11:50.976,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I remember booking an appointment with my therapist.

235
0:11:53.56,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Yes, I'm an African who has a therapist. There you go.

236
0:11:56.585,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And I said to her,

237
0:11:59.566,000 --> 0:12:01,000
"I was 13. I was a child.

238
0:12:02.001,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I was settling in a new country,

239
0:12:03.524,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I was dealing with racism and discrimination,

240
0:12:06.569,000 --> 0:12:08,000
English is my third language, and then there it was."

241
0:12:09.463,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I said to her, "I feel like I'm not a woman

242
0:12:12.35,000 --> 0:12:14,000
because of what was done to me.

243
0:12:14.774,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I feel incomplete.

244
0:12:17.53,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Am I going to be asexual?"

245
0:12:20.901,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Because from what I knew about FGM,

246
0:12:23.704,000 --> 0:12:26,000
the whole aim of it was to control the sexuality of women.

247
0:12:27.386,000 --> 0:12:3,000
It's so that we don't have any sexual desire.

248
0:12:30.53,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And I said, "Am I asexual now?

249
0:12:32.317,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Will I just live the rest of my life not feeling like having sex,

250
0:12:35.678,000 --> 0:12:37,000
not enjoying sex?"

251
0:12:38.19,000 --> 0:12:4,000
She couldn't answer my questions,

252
0:12:40.81,000 --> 0:12:42,000
so they went unanswered.

253
0:12:43.463,000 --> 0:12:45,000
When I started having my period around the age of 14,

254
0:12:46.092,000 --> 0:12:49,000
I realized I didn't have normal periods because of FGM.

255
0:12:49.973,000 --> 0:12:54,000
My periods were heavy, they were long, and they were very painful.

256
0:12:55.726,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Then they told me I had fibroids.

257
0:12:57.709,000 --> 0:12:59,000
They're like these little balls sitting there.

258
0:13:00.336,000 --> 0:13:02,000
One was covering one of my ovaries.

259
0:13:03.08,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And there came then the big news.

260
0:13:06.165,000 --> 0:13:09,000
"We don't think you can have children, Khadija."

261
0:13:09.416,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And once again, I was an angry black woman.

262
0:13:14.138,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I went home and I said to my mom,

263
0:13:17.313,000 --> 0:13:21,000
"Your act, your action, no matter what your may defense may be" --

264
0:13:21.807,000 --> 0:13:23,000
because she thought she did it out love --

265
0:13:24.401,000 --> 0:13:28,000
"what you did out of love is harming me, and it's hurting me.

266
0:13:29.029,000 --> 0:13:32,000
What do you have to say for that?"

267
0:13:32.851,000 --> 0:13:35,000
She said, "I did what I had to do as a mother."

268
0:13:36.035,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I'm still waiting for an apology, by the way.

269
0:13:40.124,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Then I got married.

270
0:13:43.811,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And once again --

271
0:13:45.949,000 --> 0:13:47,000
FGM is like the gift that keeps giving.

272
0:13:48.177,000 --> 0:13:5,000
You figure that out very soon.

273
0:13:50.862,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Sex was very painful.

274
0:13:53.888,000 --> 0:13:55,000
It hurt all the time.

275
0:13:56.138,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And of course I realized, they said, "You can't have kids."

276
0:13:59.836,000 --> 0:14:04,000
I thought, "Wow, is this my existence? Is this what life is all about?"

277
0:14:08.843,000 --> 0:14:1,000
I'm proud to tell you,

278
0:14:11.045,000 --> 0:14:12,000
five months ago,

279
0:14:12.921,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I was told I was pregnant.

280
0:14:15.435,000 --> 0:14:19,000
(Applause)

281
0:14:24.027,000 --> 0:14:25,000
I am the lucky girl.

282
0:14:25.842,000 --> 0:14:27,000
There are so many women out there who have gone through FGM

283
0:14:28.652,000 --> 0:14:29,000
who have infertility.

284
0:14:30.283,000 --> 0:14:36,000
I know a nine-year-old girl who has incontinence, constant infections, pain.

285
0:14:37.513,000 --> 0:14:39,000
It's that gift. It doesn't stop giving.

286
0:14:40.14,000 --> 0:14:43,000
It affects every area of your life,

287
0:14:43.286,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and this happened to me because I was born a girl

288
0:14:46.572,000 --> 0:14:47,000
in the wrong place.

289
0:14:48.301,000 --> 0:14:5,000
That's why it happened to me.

290
0:14:50.845,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I channel all that anger, all that pain, into advocacy

291
0:14:55.121,000 --> 0:14:58,000
because I needed my pain to be worth something.

292
0:14:58.587,000 --> 0:15:02,000
So I'm the director of an organization called No FGM Australia.

293
0:15:02.663,000 --> 0:15:03,000
You heard me right.

294
0:15:04.107,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Why No FGM Australia?

295
0:15:05.775,000 --> 0:15:08,000
FGM is in Australia.

296
0:15:08.941,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Two days ago, I had to call Child Protective Services,

297
0:15:12.606,000 --> 0:15:14,000
because somewhere in Australia,

298
0:15:15.401,000 --> 0:15:17,000
there's a four-year old

299
0:15:17.547,000 --> 0:15:21,000
there's a four-year-old whose mom is planning on performing FGM on her.

300
0:15:22.277,000 --> 0:15:28,000
That child is in kindy. I'll let that sink in: four years old.

301
0:15:31.432,000 --> 0:15:35,000
A couple of months ago, I met a lady who is married to a Malaysian man.

302
0:15:35.763,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Her husband came home one day and said he was going to take their daughters

303
0:15:39.334,000 --> 0:15:41,000
back to Malaysia to cut off their clitoris.

304
0:15:41.709,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And she said, "Why?" He said they were dirty.

305
0:15:45.91,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And she said, "Well, you married me."

306
0:15:47.728,000 --> 0:15:49,000
He said, "Oh, this is my cultural belief."

307
0:15:51.278,000 --> 0:15:53,000
They then went into a whole discussion where she said to him,

308
0:15:54.163,000 --> 0:15:57,000
"Over my dead body will you do that to my daughters."

309
0:15:57.255,000 --> 0:16:,000
But imagine if this woman wasn't aware of what FGM was,

310
0:16:01.004,000 --> 0:16:03,000
if they never had that conversation?

311
0:16:03.161,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Her children would have been flown over to Malaysia

312
0:16:06.399,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and they would have come back changed for the rest of their lives.

313
0:16:09.709,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Do you know the millions of dollars

314
0:16:11.416,000 --> 0:16:13,000
it would take us to deal with an issue like that?

315
0:16:13.802,000 --> 0:16:15,000
[Three children per day] in Australia

316
0:16:16.561,000 --> 0:16:19,000
are at risk of having FGM performed on them.

317
0:16:19.76,000 --> 0:16:21,000
This is an Australian problem, people.

318
0:16:22.261,000 --> 0:16:25,000
It's not an African problem. It's not a Middle Eastern problem.

319
0:16:25.268,000 --> 0:16:3,000
It's not white, it's not black, it has no color, it's everybody's problem.

320
0:16:30.411,000 --> 0:16:33,000
FGM is child abuse.

321
0:16:33.844,000 --> 0:16:34,000
It's violence against women.

322
0:16:35.754,000 --> 0:16:39,000
It's saying that women don't have a right to sexual pleasure.

323
0:16:39.769,000 --> 0:16:42,000
It says we don't have a right to our bodies.

324
0:16:42.804,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Well, I say no to that, and you know what? Bullshit.

325
0:16:46.613,000 --> 0:16:48,000
That's what I have to say to that.

326
0:16:48.719,000 --> 0:16:52,000
(Applause)

327
0:16:54.999,000 --> 0:16:59,000
I am proud to say that I'm doing my part in ending FGM.

328
0:17:00.514,000 --> 0:17:02,000
What are you going to do?

329
0:17:02.646,000 --> 0:17:06,000
There may be a child in your classroom who is at risk of FGM.

330
0:17:07.297,000 --> 0:17:1,000
There may be a patient who comes to your hospital

331
0:17:10.393,000 --> 0:17:11,000
who is at risk of FGM.

332
0:17:12.026,000 --> 0:17:14,000
But this is the reality,

333
0:17:14.385,000 --> 0:17:16,000
that even in our beloved Australia,

334
0:17:16.465,000 --> 0:17:18,000
the most wonderful place in the world,

335
0:17:18.567,000 --> 0:17:22,000
children are being abused because of a culture.

336
0:17:22.653,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Culture should not be a defense for child abuse.

337
0:17:25.612,000 --> 0:17:3,000
I want ever single one of you to see FGM as an issue for you.

338
0:17:30.655,000 --> 0:17:31,000
Make it personal.

339
0:17:32.141,000 --> 0:17:35,000
It could be your daughter, your sister, your cousin.

340
0:17:35.23,000 --> 0:17:37,000
I can't fight FGM alone.

341
0:17:38.321,000 --> 0:17:4,000
I could try, but I can't.

342
0:17:40.928,000 --> 0:17:42,000
So my appeal to you is, please join me.

343
0:17:43.733,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Sign my petition on Change.org

344
0:17:45.846,000 --> 0:17:48,000
and type in Khadija, my name, and it'll come up, and sign it.

345
0:17:49.833,000 --> 0:17:52,000
The aim of that is to get support for FGM victims in Australia

346
0:17:53.425,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and to protect little girls growing up here

347
0:17:55.688,000 --> 0:17:58,000
to not have this evil done to them,

348
0:17:58.826,000 --> 0:18:01,000
because every child has a right to pleasure.

349
0:18:02.509,000 --> 0:18:05,000
Every child has a right to their bodies being left intact,

350
0:18:05.97,000 --> 0:18:09,000
and dammit, ever child has a right to a clitoris.

351
0:18:10.687,000 --> 0:18:13,000
So please join me in ending this act.

352
0:18:14.352,000 --> 0:18:16,000
My favorite quote is,

353
0:18:16.501,000 --> 0:18:17,000
"All it takes for evil to prevail

354
0:18:18.349,000 --> 0:18:21,000
is for a few good men and women to do nothing."

355
0:18:21.783,000 --> 0:18:25,000
Are you going to let this evil of female genital mutilation

356
0:18:26.652,000 --> 0:18:28,000
to prevail in Australia?

357
0:18:28.884,000 --> 0:18:29,000
I don't think so,

358
0:18:30.172,000 --> 0:18:34,000
so please join me in ensuring that it ends in my generation.

359
0:18:34.198,000 --> 0:18:36,000
Thank you.

360
0:18:36.269,000 --> 0:18:38,000
(Applause)

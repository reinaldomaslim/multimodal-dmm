1
0:00:16.228,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I moved to Boston 10 years ago from Chicago,

2
0:00:19.545,000 --> 0:00:21,000
with an interest in cancer and in chemistry.

3
0:00:22.633,000 --> 0:00:25,000
You might know that chemistry is the science of making molecules

4
0:00:25.952,000 --> 0:00:26,000
or, to my taste,

5
0:00:27.292,000 --> 0:00:28,000
new drugs for cancer.

6
0:00:29.439,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And you might also know that, for science and medicine,

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Boston is a bit of a candy store.

8
0:00:35.767,000 --> 0:00:39,000
You can't roll a stop sign in Cambridge without hitting a graduate student.

9
0:00:40.414,000 --> 0:00:42,000
The bar is called the Miracle of Science.

10
0:00:42.993,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The billboards say "Lab Space Available."

11
0:00:46.656,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And it's fair to say that in these 10 years,

12
0:00:48.839,000 --> 0:00:52,000
we've witnessed absolutely the start of a scientific revolution --

13
0:00:53.17,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that of genome medicine.

14
0:00:55.035,000 --> 0:00:57,000
We know more about the patients that enter our clinic now

15
0:00:57.789,000 --> 0:00:58,000
than ever before.

16
0:00:58.972,000 --> 0:01:,000
And we're able, finally, to answer the question

17
0:01:01.22,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that's been so pressing for so many years:

18
0:01:03.608,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Why do I have cancer?

19
0:01:06.675,000 --> 0:01:08,000
This information is also pretty staggering.

20
0:01:09.215,000 --> 0:01:12,000
You might know that, so far, in just the dawn of this revolution,

21
0:01:12.332,000 --> 0:01:15,000
we know that there are perhaps 40,000 unique mutations

22
0:01:16.082,000 --> 0:01:18,000
affecting more than 10,000 genes,

23
0:01:18.717,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and that there are 500 of these genes that are bona-fide drivers,

24
0:01:22.104,000 --> 0:01:23,000
causes of cancer.

25
0:01:25.094,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Yet comparatively,

26
0:01:26.313,000 --> 0:01:28,000
we have about a dozen targeted medications.

27
0:01:29.972,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And this inadequacy of cancer medicine

28
0:01:32.258,000 --> 0:01:36,000
really hit home when my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

29
0:01:38.21,000 --> 0:01:39,000
We didn't fly him to Boston.

30
0:01:39.895,000 --> 0:01:4,000
We didn't sequence his genome.

31
0:01:41.807,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It's been known for decades what causes this malignancy.

32
0:01:46.363,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It's three proteins: ras, myc, p53.

33
0:01:50.937,000 --> 0:01:52,000
This is old information we've known since about the 80s,

34
0:01:53.659,000 --> 0:01:54,000
yet there's no medicine I can prescribe

35
0:01:55.603,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to a patient with this or any of the numerous solid tumors

36
0:01:59.19,000 --> 0:02:,000
caused by these three ...

37
0:02:01.841,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Horsemen of the Apocalypse that is cancer.

38
0:02:04.539,000 --> 0:02:06,000
There's no ras, no myc, no p53 drug.

39
0:02:07.356,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And you might fairly ask: Why is that?

40
0:02:10.309,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And the very unsatisfying yet scientific answer is:

41
0:02:13.166,000 --> 0:02:14,000
it's too hard.

42
0:02:14.88,000 --> 0:02:15,000
That for whatever reason,

43
0:02:16.174,000 --> 0:02:19,000
these three proteins have entered a space, in the language of our field,

44
0:02:19.691,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that's called the undruggable genome --

45
0:02:21.915,000 --> 0:02:23,000
which is like calling a computer unsurfable

46
0:02:24.229,000 --> 0:02:25,000
or the Moon unwalkable.

47
0:02:25.509,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It's a horrible term of trade.

48
0:02:27.641,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But what it means

49
0:02:28.823,000 --> 0:02:31,000
is that we've failed to identify a greasy pocket in these proteins,

50
0:02:32.069,000 --> 0:02:34,000
into which we, like molecular locksmiths,

51
0:02:34.363,000 --> 0:02:39,000
can fashion an active, small, organic molecule or drug substance.

52
0:02:40.034,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Now, as I was training in clinical medicine

53
0:02:42.491,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and hematology and oncology and stem-cell transplantation,

54
0:02:45.976,000 --> 0:02:46,000
what we had instead,

55
0:02:47.873,000 --> 0:02:5,000
cascading through the regulatory network at the FDA,

56
0:02:51.412,000 --> 0:02:52,000
were these substances:

57
0:02:52.869,000 --> 0:02:53,000
arsenic,

58
0:02:54.202,000 --> 0:02:55,000
thalidomide,

59
0:02:55.391,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and this chemical derivative of nitrogen mustard gas.

60
0:02:58.772,000 --> 0:03:,000
And this is the 21st century.

61
0:03:01.405,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And so, I guess you'd say,

62
0:03:02.675,000 --> 0:03:05,000
dissatisfied with the performance and quality of these medicines,

63
0:03:05.836,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I went back to school, in chemistry,

64
0:03:09.309,000 --> 0:03:13,000
with the idea that perhaps by learning the trade of discovery chemistry

65
0:03:13.992,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and approaching it in the context of this brave new world

66
0:03:16.889,000 --> 0:03:18,000
of the open source,

67
0:03:19.125,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the crowd source,

68
0:03:20.577,000 --> 0:03:23,000
the collaborative network that we have access to within academia,

69
0:03:23.906,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that we might more quickly bring powerful and targeted therapies

70
0:03:28.208,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to our patients.

71
0:03:29.951,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And so, please consider this a work in progress,

72
0:03:33.075,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but I'd like to tell you today a story

73
0:03:35.116,000 --> 0:03:38,000
about a very rare cancer called midline carcinoma,

74
0:03:39.119,000 --> 0:03:43,000
about the undruggable protein target that causes this cancer,

75
0:03:43.357,000 --> 0:03:44,000
called BRD4,

76
0:03:44.909,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and about a molecule developed at my lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,

77
0:03:48.778,000 --> 0:03:49,000
called JQ1,

78
0:03:49.954,000 --> 0:03:51,000
which we affectionately named for Jun Qi,

79
0:03:52.2,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the chemist that made this molecule.

80
0:03:54.969,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Now, BRD4 is an interesting protein.

81
0:03:57.689,000 --> 0:04:,000
You might ask: with all the things cancer's trying to do to kill our patient,

82
0:04:01.394,000 --> 0:04:02,000
how does it remember it's cancer?

83
0:04:03.006,000 --> 0:04:04,000
When it winds up its genome,

84
0:04:04.461,000 --> 0:04:06,000
divides into two cells and unwinds again,

85
0:04:06.856,000 --> 0:04:08,000
why does it not turn into an eye, into a liver,

86
0:04:09.117,000 --> 0:04:11,000
as it has all the genes necessary to do this?

87
0:04:11.522,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It remembers that it's cancer.

88
0:04:13.948,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And the reason is that cancer, like every cell in the body,

89
0:04:17.06,000 --> 0:04:18,000
places little molecular bookmarks,

90
0:04:19.06,000 --> 0:04:2,000
little Post-it notes,

91
0:04:20.462,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that remind the cell, "I'm cancer; I should keep growing."

92
0:04:24.06,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And those Post-it notes involve this and other proteins of its class --

93
0:04:28.097,000 --> 0:04:29,000
so-called bromodomains.

94
0:04:29.992,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So we developed an idea, a rationale,

95
0:04:32.684,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that perhaps if we made a molecule

96
0:04:34.857,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that prevented the Post-it note from sticking

97
0:04:37.174,000 --> 0:04:38,000
by entering into the little pocket

98
0:04:38.857,000 --> 0:04:39,000
at the base of this spinning protein,

99
0:04:40.737,000 --> 0:04:42,000
then maybe we could convince cancer cells,

100
0:04:42.817,000 --> 0:04:44,000
certainly those addicted to this BRD4 protein,

101
0:04:45.642,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that they're not cancer.

102
0:04:47.678,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And so we started to work on this problem.

103
0:04:49.925,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We developed libraries of compounds

104
0:04:52.251,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and eventually arrived at this and similar substances

105
0:04:55.06,000 --> 0:04:56,000
called JQ1.

106
0:04:56.837,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Now, not being a drug company,

107
0:04:58.425,000 --> 0:05:01,000
we could do certain things, we had certain flexibilities,

108
0:05:01.543,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that I respect that a pharmaceutical industry doesn't have.

109
0:05:04.401,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We just started mailing it to our friends.

110
0:05:07.143,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I have a small lab.

111
0:05:08.32,000 --> 0:05:11,000
We thought we'd just send it to people and see how the molecule behaves.

112
0:05:11.749,000 --> 0:05:12,000
We sent it to Oxford, England,

113
0:05:13.223,000 --> 0:05:16,000
where a group of talented crystallographers provided this picture,

114
0:05:16.469,000 --> 0:05:19,000
which helped us understand exactly how this molecule is so potent

115
0:05:19.59,000 --> 0:05:2,000
for this protein target.

116
0:05:20.78,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It's what we call a perfect fit of shape complementarity,

117
0:05:23.74,000 --> 0:05:24,000
or hand in glove.

118
0:05:25.587,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Now, this is a very rare cancer,

119
0:05:27.232,000 --> 0:05:28,000
this BRD4-addicted cancer.

120
0:05:29.461,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And so we worked with samples of material

121
0:05:31.716,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that were collected by young pathologists at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

122
0:05:35.314,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And as we treated these cells with this molecule,

123
0:05:37.711,000 --> 0:05:39,000
we observed something really striking.

124
0:05:40.06,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The cancer cells --

125
0:05:41.29,000 --> 0:05:43,000
small, round and rapidly dividing,

126
0:05:43.381,000 --> 0:05:45,000
grew these arms and extensions.

127
0:05:45.758,000 --> 0:05:46,000
They were changing shape.

128
0:05:47.58,000 --> 0:05:48,000
In effect,

129
0:05:48.931,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the cancer cell was forgetting it was cancer

130
0:05:52.262,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and becoming a normal cell.

131
0:05:55.336,000 --> 0:05:56,000
This got us very excited.

132
0:05:58.101,000 --> 0:06:,000
The next step would be to put this molecule into mice.

133
0:06:00.713,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The only problem was there's no mouse model of this rare cancer.

134
0:06:04.132,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And so at the time we were doing this research,

135
0:06:06.879,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I was caring for a 29-year-old firefighter from Connecticut

136
0:06:10.476,000 --> 0:06:11,000
who was very much at the end of life

137
0:06:12.382,000 --> 0:06:13,000
with this incurable cancer.

138
0:06:14.881,000 --> 0:06:17,000
This BRD4-addicted cancer was growing throughout his left lung.

139
0:06:18.355,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And he had a chest tube in that was draining little bits of debris.

140
0:06:21.544,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And every nursing shift, we would throw this material out.

141
0:06:24.529,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And so we approached this patient

142
0:06:26.32,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and asked if he would collaborate with us.

143
0:06:28.975,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Could we take this precious and rare cancerous material

144
0:06:32.698,000 --> 0:06:33,000
from this chest tube

145
0:06:34.321,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and drive it across town and put it into mice

146
0:06:36.564,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and try to do a clinical trial at a stage that with a prototype drug,

147
0:06:40.229,000 --> 0:06:42,000
well, that would be, of course, impossible

148
0:06:42.277,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and, rightly, illegal to do in humans.

149
0:06:44.134,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And he obliged us.

150
0:06:46.266,000 --> 0:06:48,000
At the Lurie Family Center for Animal Imaging,

151
0:06:48.482,000 --> 0:06:51,000
our colleague, Andrew Kung, grew this cancer successfully in mice

152
0:06:52.121,000 --> 0:06:53,000
without ever touching plastic.

153
0:06:53.835,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And you can see this PET scan of a mouse -- what we call a pet PET.

154
0:06:57.275,000 --> 0:06:58,000
The cancer is growing

155
0:06:58.855,000 --> 0:07:,000
as this red, huge mass in the hind limb of this animal.

156
0:07:02.181,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And as we treat it with our compound,

157
0:07:04.428,000 --> 0:07:05,000
this addiction to sugar,

158
0:07:06.06,000 --> 0:07:07,000
this rapid growth, faded.

159
0:07:07.675,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And on the animal on the right,

160
0:07:09.742,000 --> 0:07:11,000
you see that the cancer was responding.

161
0:07:12.829,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We've completed, now, clinical trials

162
0:07:15.06,000 --> 0:07:16,000
in four mouse models of this disease.

163
0:07:17.06,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And every time, we see the same thing.

164
0:07:18.933,000 --> 0:07:2,000
The mice with this cancer that get the drug live,

165
0:07:21.662,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and the ones that don't rapidly perish.

166
0:07:26.06,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So we started to wonder,

167
0:07:27.513,000 --> 0:07:29,000
what would a drug company do at this point?

168
0:07:29.641,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Well, they probably would keep this a secret

169
0:07:31.714,000 --> 0:07:32,000
until they turn the prototype drug

170
0:07:33.623,000 --> 0:07:35,000
into an active pharmaceutical substance.

171
0:07:36.323,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So we did just the opposite.

172
0:07:38.144,000 --> 0:07:4,000
We published a paper that described this finding

173
0:07:41.003,000 --> 0:07:42,000
at the earliest prototype stage.

174
0:07:43.773,000 --> 0:07:45,000
We gave the world the chemical identity of this molecule,

175
0:07:46.705,000 --> 0:07:47,000
typically a secret in our discipline.

176
0:07:48.626,000 --> 0:07:49,000
We told people exactly how to make it.

177
0:07:51.299,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We gave them our email address,

178
0:07:52.991,000 --> 0:07:53,000
suggesting that if they write us,

179
0:07:54.666,000 --> 0:07:55,000
we'll send them a free molecule.

180
0:07:56.292,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Laughter)

181
0:07:57.404,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We basically tried to create the most competitive environment

182
0:08:00.325,000 --> 0:08:01,000
for our lab as possible.

183
0:08:01.509,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And this was, unfortunately, successful.

184
0:08:03.475,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Laughter)

185
0:08:04.523,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Because now, we've shared this molecule,

186
0:08:06.552,000 --> 0:08:08,000
just since December of last year,

187
0:08:08.979,000 --> 0:08:1,000
with 40 laboratories in the United States

188
0:08:11.258,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and 30 more in Europe --

189
0:08:13.06,000 --> 0:08:14,000
many of them pharmaceutical companies,

190
0:08:14.933,000 --> 0:08:15,000
seeking now to enter this space,

191
0:08:16.552,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to target this rare cancer that, thankfully right now,

192
0:08:20.456,000 --> 0:08:22,000
is quite desirable to study in that industry.

193
0:08:25.322,000 --> 0:08:28,000
But the science that's coming back from all of these laboratories

194
0:08:28.415,000 --> 0:08:29,000
about the use of this molecule

195
0:08:30.273,000 --> 0:08:33,000
has provided us insights we might not have had on our own.

196
0:08:33.47,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Leukemia cells treated with this compound

197
0:08:35.471,000 --> 0:08:37,000
turn into normal white blood cells.

198
0:08:38.536,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Mice with multiple myeloma,

199
0:08:40.341,000 --> 0:08:43,000
an incurable malignancy of the bone marrow,

200
0:08:43.4,000 --> 0:08:44,000
respond dramatically

201
0:08:45.401,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to the treatment with this drug.

202
0:08:47.576,000 --> 0:08:48,000
You might know that fat has memory.

203
0:08:50.624,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I'll nicely demonstrate that for you.

204
0:08:52.624,000 --> 0:08:53,000
(Laughter)

205
0:08:53.679,000 --> 0:08:54,000
In fact, this molecule

206
0:08:55.255,000 --> 0:08:58,000
prevents this adipocyte, this fat stem cell,

207
0:08:58.679,000 --> 0:09:,000
from remembering how to make fat,

208
0:09:01.572,000 --> 0:09:03,000
such that mice on a high-fat diet,

209
0:09:03.964,000 --> 0:09:05,000
like the folks in my hometown of Chicago --

210
0:09:06.102,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Laughter)

211
0:09:07.134,000 --> 0:09:09,000
fail to develop fatty liver,

212
0:09:09.166,000 --> 0:09:1,000
which is a major medical problem.

213
0:09:12.18,000 --> 0:09:13,000
What this research taught us --

214
0:09:13.776,000 --> 0:09:15,000
not just my lab, but our institute,

215
0:09:16.06,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and Harvard Medical School more generally --

216
0:09:18.156,000 --> 0:09:2,000
is that we have unique resources in academia

217
0:09:20.441,000 --> 0:09:21,000
for drug discovery;

218
0:09:21.799,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that our center, which has tested perhaps more cancer molecules

219
0:09:25.006,000 --> 0:09:26,000
in a scientific way

220
0:09:26.187,000 --> 0:09:27,000
than any other,

221
0:09:27.362,000 --> 0:09:28,000
never made one of its own.

222
0:09:29.805,000 --> 0:09:31,000
For all the reasons you see listed here,

223
0:09:31.996,000 --> 0:09:33,000
we think there's a great opportunity for academic centers

224
0:09:34.759,000 --> 0:09:37,000
to participate in this earliest, conceptually tricky

225
0:09:38.607,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and creative discipline

226
0:09:40.561,000 --> 0:09:41,000
of prototype drug discovery.

227
0:09:45.132,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So what next?

228
0:09:46.609,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We have this molecule, but it's not a pill yet.

229
0:09:49.013,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It's not orally bioavailable.

230
0:09:51.631,000 --> 0:09:54,000
We need to fix it so we can deliver it to our patients.

231
0:09:54.85,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And everyone in the lab,

232
0:09:56.458,000 --> 0:09:58,000
especially following the interaction with these patients,

233
0:09:59.283,000 --> 0:10:01,000
feels quite compelled to deliver a drug substance

234
0:10:01.632,000 --> 0:10:02,000
based on this molecule.

235
0:10:02.854,000 --> 0:10:03,000
It's here where I'd say

236
0:10:04.289,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that we could use your help and your insights,

237
0:10:06.528,000 --> 0:10:07,000
your collaborative participation.

238
0:10:08.741,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Unlike a drug company, we don't have a pipeline

239
0:10:12.446,000 --> 0:10:14,000
that we can deposit these molecules into.

240
0:10:14.477,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We don't have a team of salespeople and marketeers

241
0:10:16.898,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to tell us how to position this drug against the other.

242
0:10:19.633,000 --> 0:10:21,000
What we do have is the flexibility of an academic center

243
0:10:22.325,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to work with competent, motivated,

244
0:10:24.701,000 --> 0:10:26,000
enthusiastic, hopefully well-funded people

245
0:10:27.63,000 --> 0:10:29,000
to carry these molecules forward into the clinic

246
0:10:29.947,000 --> 0:10:32,000
while preserving our ability to share the prototype drug worldwide.

247
0:10:34.734,000 --> 0:10:36,000
This molecule will soon leave our benches

248
0:10:37.399,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and go into a small start-up company called Tensha Therapeutics.

249
0:10:40.473,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And, really, this is the fourth of these molecules

250
0:10:43.433,000 --> 0:10:45,000
to kind of "graduate" from our little pipeline

251
0:10:45.704,000 --> 0:10:46,000
of drug discovery,

252
0:10:47.182,000 --> 0:10:51,000
two of which -- a topical drug for lymphoma of the skin

253
0:10:52.457,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and an oral substance for the treatment of multiple myeloma --

254
0:10:55.592,000 --> 0:10:58,000
will actually come to the bedside for the first clinical trial

255
0:10:58.854,000 --> 0:11:01,000
in July of this year -- for us, a major and exciting milestone.

256
0:11:03.909,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I want to leave you with just two ideas.

257
0:11:05.956,000 --> 0:11:09,000
The first is: if anything is unique about this research,

258
0:11:10.314,000 --> 0:11:12,000
it's less the science than the strategy.

259
0:11:12.695,000 --> 0:11:14,000
This, for us, was a social experiment --

260
0:11:15.141,000 --> 0:11:2,000
an experiment in "What would happen if we were as open and honest

261
0:11:20.43,000 --> 0:11:22,000
at the earliest phase of discovery chemistry research

262
0:11:22.97,000 --> 0:11:23,000
as we could be?"

263
0:11:24.441,000 --> 0:11:26,000
This string of letters and numbers

264
0:11:26.806,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and symbols and parentheses

265
0:11:28.845,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that can be texted, I suppose,

266
0:11:30.488,000 --> 0:11:31,000
or Twittered worldwide,

267
0:11:33.208,000 --> 0:11:35,000
is the chemical identity of our pro compound.

268
0:11:35.734,000 --> 0:11:39,000
It's the information that we most need from pharmaceutical companies,

269
0:11:39.84,000 --> 0:11:43,000
the information on how these early prototype drugs might work.

270
0:11:44.948,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Yet this information is largely a secret.

271
0:11:47.742,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And so we seek, really, to download

272
0:11:50.645,000 --> 0:11:53,000
from the amazing successes of the computer-science industry,

273
0:11:53.788,000 --> 0:11:57,000
two principles -- that of open source and that of crowdsourcing --

274
0:11:58.191,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to quickly, responsibly accelerate the delivery of targeted therapeutics

275
0:12:04.209,000 --> 0:12:05,000
to patients with cancer.

276
0:12:06.377,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Now, the business model involves all of you.

277
0:12:09.52,000 --> 0:12:1,000
This research is funded by the public.

278
0:12:11.845,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It's funded by foundations.

279
0:12:13.247,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And one thing I've learned in Boston

280
0:12:15.001,000 --> 0:12:18,000
is that you people will do anything for cancer, and I love that.

281
0:12:18.099,000 --> 0:12:2,000
You bike across the state, you walk up and down the river.

282
0:12:21.02,000 --> 0:12:22,000
(Laughter)

283
0:12:23.15,000 --> 0:12:25,000
I've never seen, really, anywhere,

284
0:12:25.5,000 --> 0:12:28,000
this unique support for cancer research.

285
0:12:28.767,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And so I want to thank you

286
0:12:30.548,000 --> 0:12:33,000
for your participation, your collaboration

287
0:12:33.869,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and most of all,

288
0:12:35.054,000 --> 0:12:36,000
for your confidence in our ideas.

289
0:12:37.012,000 --> 0:12:42,000
(Applause)

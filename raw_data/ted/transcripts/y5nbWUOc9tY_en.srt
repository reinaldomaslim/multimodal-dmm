2
0:00:16.31,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's time to start designing for our ears.

3
0:00:20.101,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Architects and designers tend to focus

4
0:00:22.181,000 --> 0:00:23,000
exclusively on these.

5
0:00:23.707,000 --> 0:00:26,000
They use these to design with and they design for them,

6
0:00:26.821,000 --> 0:00:28,000
which is why we end up sitting in restaurants that look

7
0:00:29.149,000 --> 0:00:3,000
like this — (loud crowd noise) — and sound like this,

8
0:00:30.946,000 --> 0:00:32,000
shouting from a foot away to try and be heard

9
0:00:33.493,000 --> 0:00:34,000
by our dinner companion,

10
0:00:34.795,000 --> 0:00:37,000
or why we get on airplanes -- (flight attendant announcements) -- which cost 200 million pounds,

11
0:00:38.018,000 --> 0:00:41,000
with somebody talking through an old-fashioned telephone handset

12
0:00:41.861,000 --> 0:00:42,000
on a cheap stereo system,

13
0:00:43.397,000 --> 0:00:45,000
making us jump out of our skins.

14
0:00:46.05,000 --> 0:00:49,000
We're designing environments that make us crazy. (Laughter)

15
0:00:49.434,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And it's not just our quality of life which suffers.

16
0:00:52.146,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It's our health,

17
0:00:53.921,000 --> 0:00:57,000
our social behavior, and our productivity as well.

18
0:00:57.932,000 --> 0:00:58,000
How does this work? Well, two ways.

19
0:00:59.574,000 --> 0:01:02,000
First of all, ambience. I have a whole TEDTalk about this.

20
0:01:03.013,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Sound affects us physiologically, psychologically,

21
0:01:06.444,000 --> 0:01:08,000
cognitively and behaviorally all the time.

22
0:01:08.644,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The sound around us is affecting us

23
0:01:10.381,000 --> 0:01:12,000
even though we're not conscious of it.

24
0:01:12.703,000 --> 0:01:13,000
There's a second way though, as well.

25
0:01:14.459,000 --> 0:01:17,000
That's interference. Communication requires sending

26
0:01:17.836,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and receiving, and I have another whole TEDTalk

27
0:01:21.736,000 --> 0:01:23,000
about the importance of conscious listening,

28
0:01:24.2,000 --> 0:01:26,000
but I can send as well as I like,

29
0:01:26.234,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and you can be brilliant conscious listeners.

30
0:01:28.648,000 --> 0:01:31,000
If the space I'm sending it in is not effective,

31
0:01:32.148,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that communication can't happen.

32
0:01:34.642,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Spaces tend to include noise and acoustics.

33
0:01:37.172,000 --> 0:01:4,000
A room like this has acoustics, this one very good acoustics.

34
0:01:40.872,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Many rooms are not so good.

35
0:01:43.04,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Let me give you some examples from a couple of areas

36
0:01:45.071,000 --> 0:01:48,000
which I think we all care about: health and education.

37
0:01:48.544,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Hospital noises) When I was visiting my terminally ill father

38
0:01:50.776,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in a hospital, I was asking myself,

39
0:01:52.808,000 --> 0:01:56,000
how does anybody get well in a place that sounds like this?

40
0:01:56.945,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Hospital sound is getting worse all the time.

41
0:01:59.253,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Noise levels in hospitals have doubled

42
0:02:01.259,000 --> 0:02:04,000
in the last few years, and it affects not just the patients

43
0:02:04.863,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but also the people working there.

44
0:02:06.679,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I think we would like for dispensing errors to be zero,

45
0:02:10.556,000 --> 0:02:13,000
wouldn't we? And yet, as noise levels go up, so do

46
0:02:14.021,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the errors in dispensing made by the staff in hospitals.

47
0:02:17.575,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Most of all, though, it affects the patients,

48
0:02:20.63,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and that could be you, it could be me.

49
0:02:22.838,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Sleep is absolutely crucial for recovery.

50
0:02:25.177,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It's when we regenerate, when we rebuild ourselves,

51
0:02:28.217,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and with threatening noise like this going on,

52
0:02:30.601,000 --> 0:02:33,000
your body, even if you are able to sleep, your body

53
0:02:33.753,000 --> 0:02:36,000
is telling you, "I'm under threat. This is dangerous."

54
0:02:36.796,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And the quality of sleep is degraded, and so is our recovery.

55
0:02:40.025,000 --> 0:02:42,000
There are just huge benefits to come

56
0:02:42.177,000 --> 0:02:45,000
from designing for the ears in our health care.

57
0:02:45.214,000 --> 0:02:47,000
This is an area I intend to take on this year.

58
0:02:48.121,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Education.

59
0:02:50.086,000 --> 0:02:51,000
When I see a classroom that looks like this,

60
0:02:51.682,000 --> 0:02:52,000
can you imagine how this sounds?

61
0:02:53.559,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I am forced to ask myself a question.

62
0:02:55.89,000 --> 0:02:57,000
("Do architects have ears?") (Laughter)

63
0:02:58.467,000 --> 0:03:,000
Now, that's a little unfair. Some of my best friends

64
0:03:01.134,000 --> 0:03:03,000
are architects. (Laughter) And they definitely do have ears.

65
0:03:04.023,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But I think sometimes they don't use them

66
0:03:06.088,000 --> 0:03:08,000
when they're designing buildings. Here's a case in point.

67
0:03:08.751,000 --> 0:03:11,000
This is a 32-million-pound flagship academy school

68
0:03:12.442,000 --> 0:03:14,000
which was built quite recently in the U.K. and designed

69
0:03:14.447,000 --> 0:03:17,000
by one of Britain's top architects.

70
0:03:17.594,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Unfortunately, it was designed like a corporate

71
0:03:19.419,000 --> 0:03:21,000
headquarters, with a vast central atrium

72
0:03:21.818,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and classrooms leading off it with no back walls at all.

73
0:03:26.092,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The children couldn't hear their teachers.

74
0:03:28.018,000 --> 0:03:3,000
They had to go back in and spend 600,000 pounds

75
0:03:30.739,000 --> 0:03:33,000
putting the walls in. Let's stop this madness

76
0:03:33.819,000 --> 0:03:37,000
of open plan classrooms right now, please.

77
0:03:37.881,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It's not just these modern buildings which suffer.

78
0:03:41.409,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Old-fashioned classrooms suffer too.

79
0:03:43.746,000 --> 0:03:45,000
A study in Florida just a few years ago found

80
0:03:45.94,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that if you're sitting where this photograph was taken

81
0:03:47.617,000 --> 0:03:5,000
in the classroom, row four, speech intelligibility

82
0:03:50.817,000 --> 0:03:52,000
is just 50 percent.

83
0:03:53.268,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Children are losing one word in two.

84
0:03:55.468,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Now that doesn't mean they only get half their education,

85
0:03:58.113,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but it does mean they have to work very hard

86
0:03:59.825,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to join the dots and understand what's going on.

87
0:04:02.801,000 --> 0:04:04,000
This is affected massively by reverberation time,

88
0:04:05.574,000 --> 0:04:06,000
how reverberant a room is.

89
0:04:07.474,000 --> 0:04:1,000
In a classroom with a reverberation time of 1.2 seconds,

90
0:04:11.032,000 --> 0:04:14,000
which is pretty common, this is what it sounds like.

91
0:04:14.728,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Inaudible echoing voice)

92
0:04:27.032,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Not so good, is it?

93
0:04:28.849,000 --> 0:04:32,000
If you take that 1.2 seconds down to 0.4 seconds

94
0:04:33.308,000 --> 0:04:35,000
by installing acoustic treatments, sound absorbing materials

95
0:04:36.256,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and so forth, this is what you get.

96
0:04:38.964,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Voice: In language, infinitely many words can be written

97
0:04:42.825,000 --> 0:04:44,000
with a small set of letters. In arithmetic,

98
0:04:45.697,000 --> 0:04:47,000
infinitely many numbers can be composed

99
0:04:48.051,000 --> 0:04:51,000
from just a few digits with the help of the simple zero.

100
0:04:51.653,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Julian Treasure: What a difference.

101
0:04:53.217,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Now that education you would receive,

102
0:04:55.057,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and thanks to the British acoustician Adrian James

103
0:04:57.987,000 --> 0:04:59,000
for those simulations. The signal was the same,

104
0:05:00.676,000 --> 0:05:01,000
the background noise was the same.

105
0:05:02.075,000 --> 0:05:04,000
All that changed was the acoustics of the classroom

106
0:05:04.518,000 --> 0:05:05,000
in those two examples.

107
0:05:06.192,000 --> 0:05:08,000
If education can be likened to watering a garden,

108
0:05:08.612,000 --> 0:05:12,000
which is a fair metaphor, sadly, much of the water

109
0:05:12.779,000 --> 0:05:15,000
is evaporating before it reaches the flowers,

110
0:05:15.835,000 --> 0:05:17,000
especially for some groups,

111
0:05:17.867,000 --> 0:05:2,000
for example, those with hearing impairment.

112
0:05:21.243,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Now that's not just deaf children. That could be any child

113
0:05:23.995,000 --> 0:05:25,000
who's got a cold, glue ear, an ear infection,

114
0:05:26.43,000 --> 0:05:28,000
even hay fever. On a given day, one in eight children

115
0:05:28.806,000 --> 0:05:3,000
fall into that group, on any given day.

116
0:05:31.622,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Then you have children for whom English is a second language,

117
0:05:34.798,000 --> 0:05:36,000
or whatever they're being taught in is a second language.

118
0:05:37.734,000 --> 0:05:4,000
In the U.K., that's more than 10 percent of the school population.

119
0:05:41.318,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And finally, after Susan Cain's wonderful TEDTalk in February,

120
0:05:44.978,000 --> 0:05:47,000
we know that introverts find it very difficult to relate

121
0:05:48.194,000 --> 0:05:5,000
when they're in a noisy environment doing group work.

122
0:05:50.891,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Add those up. That is a lot of children

123
0:05:53.552,000 --> 0:05:55,000
who are not receiving their education properly.

124
0:05:55.964,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It's not just the children who are affected, though.

125
0:05:58.2,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Noisy conversation) This study in Germany found

126
0:05:59.783,000 --> 0:06:02,000
the average noise level in classrooms is 65 decibels.

127
0:06:03.338,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I have to really raise my voice to talk over 65 decibels

128
0:06:07.564,000 --> 0:06:1,000
of sound, and teachers are not just raising their voices.

129
0:06:11.348,000 --> 0:06:13,000
This chart maps the teacher's heart rate

130
0:06:14.156,000 --> 0:06:16,000
against the noise level.

131
0:06:16.58,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Noise goes up, heart rate goes up.

132
0:06:19.287,000 --> 0:06:21,000
That is not good for you.

133
0:06:21.436,000 --> 0:06:25,000
In fact, 65 decibels is the very level at which this big survey

134
0:06:25.516,000 --> 0:06:28,000
of all the evidence on noise and health found that, that is

135
0:06:29.044,000 --> 0:06:33,000
the threshold for the danger of myocardial infarction.

136
0:06:33.751,000 --> 0:06:35,000
To you and me, that's a heart attack.

137
0:06:36.6,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It may not be pushing the boat out too far to suggest

138
0:06:39.319,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that many teachers are losing significant life expectancy

139
0:06:43.619,000 --> 0:06:47,000
by teaching in environments like that day after day.

140
0:06:47.891,000 --> 0:06:49,000
What does it cost to treat a classroom

141
0:06:49.947,000 --> 0:06:51,000
down to that 0.4-second reverberation time?

142
0:06:52.717,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Two and a half thousand pounds.

143
0:06:55.451,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And the Essex study which has just been done in the U.K.,

144
0:06:58.627,000 --> 0:07:,000
which incidentally showed that when you do this,

145
0:07:00.968,000 --> 0:07:02,000
you do not just make a room that's suitable

146
0:07:03.331,000 --> 0:07:04,000
for hearing-impaired children, you make a room

147
0:07:04.928,000 --> 0:07:09,000
where behavior improves, and results improve significantly,

148
0:07:10.212,000 --> 0:07:13,000
this found that sending a child out of area to a school

149
0:07:14.204,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that does have such a room, if you don't have one,

150
0:07:16.835,000 --> 0:07:19,000
costs 90,000 pounds a year.

151
0:07:20.297,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I think the economics are pretty clear on this.

152
0:07:22.684,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I'm glad that debate is happening on this.

153
0:07:24.703,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I just moderated a major conference in London

154
0:07:27.269,000 --> 0:07:29,000
a few weeks ago called Sound Education,

155
0:07:29.318,000 --> 0:07:3,000
which brought together top acousticians,

156
0:07:31.115,000 --> 0:07:33,000
government people, teachers, and so forth.

157
0:07:33.136,000 --> 0:07:37,000
We're at last starting to debate this issue, and the benefits

158
0:07:37.335,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that are available for designing for the ears in education,

159
0:07:40.035,000 --> 0:07:41,000
unbelievable.

160
0:07:41.846,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Out of that conference, incidentally, also came

161
0:07:44.915,000 --> 0:07:47,000
a free app which is designed to help children study

162
0:07:47.917,000 --> 0:07:49,000
if they're having to work at home, for example,

163
0:07:50.288,000 --> 0:07:51,000
in a noisy kitchen.

164
0:07:51.88,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And that's free out of that conference.

165
0:07:55.118,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Let's broaden the perspective a little bit

166
0:07:58.069,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and look at cities.

167
0:07:59.48,000 --> 0:08:01,000
We have urban planners.

168
0:08:01.972,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Where are the urban sound planners?

169
0:08:05.117,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I don't know of one in the world, and the opportunity is there

170
0:08:08.324,000 --> 0:08:1,000
to transform our experience in our cities.

171
0:08:10.86,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The World Health Organization estimates

172
0:08:12.967,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that a quarter of Europe's population is having its sleep

173
0:08:15.551,000 --> 0:08:18,000
degraded by noise in cities. We can do better than that.

174
0:08:19.484,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And in our offices, we spend a lot of time at work.

175
0:08:22.313,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Where are the office sound planners?

176
0:08:24.972,000 --> 0:08:25,000
People who say, don't sit that team next to this team,

177
0:08:26.859,000 --> 0:08:28,000
because they like noise and they need quiet.

178
0:08:29.192,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Or who say, don't spend all your budget on a huge screen

179
0:08:31.931,000 --> 0:08:31,000
in the conference room,

180
0:08:32.874,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and then place one tiny microphone

181
0:08:34.883,000 --> 0:08:37,000
in the middle of a table for 30 people. (Laughter)

182
0:08:38.12,000 --> 0:08:4,000
If you can hear me, you can understand me

183
0:08:40.239,000 --> 0:08:43,000
without seeing me. If you can see me without hearing me,

184
0:08:43.364,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that does not work.

185
0:08:45.468,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So office sound is a huge area, and incidentally,

186
0:08:48.684,000 --> 0:08:5,000
noise in offices has been shown to make people

187
0:08:50.82,000 --> 0:08:52,000
less helpful, less enjoy their teamwork,

188
0:08:53.443,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and less productive at work.

189
0:08:55.964,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Finally, we have homes. We use interior designers.

190
0:08:59.017,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Where are the interior sound designers?

191
0:09:01.252,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Hey, let's all be interior sound designers,

192
0:09:04.592,000 --> 0:09:06,000
take on listening to our rooms and designing sound

193
0:09:07.409,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that's effective and appropriate.

194
0:09:08.927,000 --> 0:09:1,000
My friend Richard Mazuch, an architect in London,

195
0:09:11.468,000 --> 0:09:13,000
coined the phrase "invisible architecture."

196
0:09:14.354,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I love that phrase.

197
0:09:15.904,000 --> 0:09:2,000
It's about designing, not appearance, but experience,

198
0:09:20.984,000 --> 0:09:23,000
so that we have spaces that sound as good as they look,

199
0:09:24.592,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that are fit for purpose, that improve our quality of life,

200
0:09:28.102,000 --> 0:09:31,000
our health and well being, our social behavior

201
0:09:31.343,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and our productivity.

202
0:09:33.219,000 --> 0:09:36,000
It's time to start designing for the ears.

203
0:09:36.725,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Thank you. (Applause)

204
0:09:39.555,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Applause)

205
0:09:41.087,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Thank you. (Applause)

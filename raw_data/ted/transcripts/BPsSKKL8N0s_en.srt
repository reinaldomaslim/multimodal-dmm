1
0:00:12.72,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Well, I have known many alpha males in my life,

2
0:00:16.52,000 --> 0:00:17,000
chimpanzee alpha males,

3
0:00:19,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and I'm going to talk about what an alpha male is,

4
0:00:22.44,000 --> 0:00:26,000
because I think we can all learn a lot from our close relatives

5
0:00:26.48,000 --> 0:00:28,000
where we have alpha males.

6
0:00:28.6,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And as an example, I want to give you Amos, a male that I knew

7
0:00:33.08,000 --> 0:00:35,000
who was a young male and he was alpha male,

8
0:00:35.32,000 --> 0:00:36,000
he was very popular,

9
0:00:36.76,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but he got sick

10
0:00:38.88,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and he lost his position because, you know, chimpanzee males

11
0:00:42.08,000 --> 0:00:44,000
they can spot from a mile away if you are weak

12
0:00:44.96,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and they went for him,

13
0:00:46.36,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and he lost his position, and then he got sicker and sicker

14
0:00:49.36,000 --> 0:00:51,000
until at some point we had to isolate him.

15
0:00:52.28,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The group lived on a grassy island,

16
0:00:56.04,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and we had to isolate him in a cage,

17
0:00:58.4,000 --> 0:01:,000
but we cracked open the cage so that the rest of the chimps

18
0:01:01.24,000 --> 0:01:02,000
still had access to him.

19
0:01:02.76,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And what happened was most touching.

20
0:01:04.92,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Other chimps would bring food to him,

21
0:01:07.72,000 --> 0:01:08,000
they would bring wood wool to him,

22
0:01:09.68,000 --> 0:01:12,000
which is this thing that they use to sleep in and build nests out of,

23
0:01:13.24,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and females would put the wood wool behind his back.

24
0:01:16.12,000 --> 0:01:17,000
He was leaning heavily against the wall,

25
0:01:18.08,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and the way we do with pillows to patients in a hospital,

26
0:01:22.48,000 --> 0:01:24,000
they were putting that stuff behind his back.

27
0:01:24.64,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And I thought, this is the way to go for an alpha male.

28
0:01:28.04,000 --> 0:01:31,000
He was loved and respected, and everyone was taking care of him,

29
0:01:32.04,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and this is not always how it goes,

30
0:01:33.76,000 --> 0:01:36,000
because some males don't end so well when they lose their position.

31
0:01:37.48,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So Amos was an example of a male who was liked as a leader,

32
0:01:42.68,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and I think the term alpha male, if you look it up on the internet,

33
0:01:46.12,000 --> 0:01:49,000
you will find all these business books that tell you how to be an alpha male,

34
0:01:49.8,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and what they mean is how to beat up others

35
0:01:52.2,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and beat them over the head and let them know that you are boss

36
0:01:55.2,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and don't mess with me and so on.

37
0:01:56.96,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And basically an alpha male for them is a bully.

38
0:02:00.88,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And I really don't like that kind of description,

39
0:02:04.52,000 --> 0:02:08,000
because I am actually partly responsible for the term "alpha male"

40
0:02:08.76,000 --> 0:02:1,000
because I wrote this book "Chimpanzee Politics,"

41
0:02:11.04,000 --> 0:02:16,000
which was recommended by Newt Gingrich to freshmen congressmen.

42
0:02:16.52,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I don't know what good it did, but he recommended that book to them,

43
0:02:20.28,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and after that the term "alpha male" became very popular.

44
0:02:24.48,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But I think it is used in a mischaracterization.

45
0:02:27.76,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It's used in a very superficial way

46
0:02:30.12,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that doesn't relate to what a real alpha male is.

47
0:02:32.72,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And so I'm here to explain what that is.

48
0:02:35.2,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The term itself goes back actually much further.

49
0:02:37.88,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It goes back to the '40s and '50s, research on wolves,

50
0:02:41.6,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and basically the definition is very simple.

51
0:02:43.72,000 --> 0:02:45,000
The highest ranking male is the alpha male.

52
0:02:45.76,000 --> 0:02:47,000
The highest ranking female is the alpha female.

53
0:02:48.04,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Every primate group has one alpha male, one alpha female,

54
0:02:51.92,000 --> 0:02:53,000
not more than that, there's only one.

55
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And I will explain how that goes.

56
0:02:57.24,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So first, the body language.

57
0:02:59.48,000 --> 0:03:03,000
What you see here is two male chimpanzees who are the same size,

58
0:03:03.56,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but one is walking upright, has his hair up,

59
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
has a big rock in his hand, and he's the alpha male.

60
0:03:08.6,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The other male is pant-grunting to him,

61
0:03:11.08,000 --> 0:03:14,000
is being submissive to him and bowing for him,

62
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and that is the sort of ritual they need to go through many times a day

63
0:03:17.56,000 --> 0:03:18,000
in order to have a stable relationship.

64
0:03:20.4,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I'll show you a video from the field.

65
0:03:23.28,000 --> 0:03:26,000
What you will see here is a female pant-grunting to an alpha male

66
0:03:26.84,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and you will see how that goes.

67
0:03:29.12,000 --> 0:03:3,000
The male is approaching,

68
0:03:30.56,000 --> 0:03:31,000
she grunts at him.

69
0:03:31.92,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Chimpanzee grunts)

70
0:03:33.44,000 --> 0:03:35,000
He has all his hair up

71
0:03:35.68,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and he displays.

72
0:03:39.24,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I'm actually standing far too close.

73
0:03:41.64,000 --> 0:03:44,000
A chimpanzee is far stronger than I am,

74
0:03:44.68,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and I just was not very prudent, this particular video.

75
0:03:48.52,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So what you saw him do

76
0:03:51.68,000 --> 0:03:53,000
is he was lifting himself up and standing on two legs,

77
0:03:54.68,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and putting his arms out.

78
0:03:55.96,000 --> 0:03:56,000
That's called the bipedal swagger.

79
0:03:57.64,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It's a very common posture in high-ranking males,

80
0:04:00.4,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and it's very recognizable because humans do this kind of stuff.

81
0:04:03.48,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:04.72,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Humans do this all the time.

83
0:04:07.24,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And what I really like about this particular picture

84
0:04:10.64,000 --> 0:04:12,000
is the two old guys to the side.

85
0:04:13.48,000 --> 0:04:14,000
This is very chimpanzee.

86
0:04:15.24,000 --> 0:04:16,000
In chimpanzees,

87
0:04:16.64,000 --> 0:04:19,000
we have usually old males who are over the hill,

88
0:04:19.84,000 --> 0:04:22,000
who cannot be alpha male themselves anymore,

89
0:04:22.88,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but they start playing games and forming coalitions,

90
0:04:25.72,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and behind the backs of others.

91
0:04:27.64,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And they become extremely influential,

92
0:04:29.519,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and you may actually have old males

93
0:04:31.64,000 --> 0:04:34,000
who are more influential than the alpha male himself.

94
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Just as an example,

95
0:04:36.64,000 --> 0:04:38,000
the three males that I used to work with most

96
0:04:39.08,000 --> 0:04:41,000
at the Dutch zoo long ago, where I worked,

97
0:04:41.56,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and the middle male here is a 17-year-old alpha male.

98
0:04:45.92,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The male whom he is grooming on the side is twice as old,

99
0:04:50.28,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and this old male has made him the leader.

100
0:04:53.08,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So you can imagine that that old male has an enormous amount of power,

101
0:04:56.44,000 --> 0:04:58,000
because he has made the alpha male alpha male.

102
0:04:58.8,000 --> 0:04:59,000
The male on the right

103
0:05:00.48,000 --> 0:05:02,000
is individually the strongest male.

104
0:05:02.96,000 --> 0:05:04,000
In captivity, you can test it out,

105
0:05:05.72,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and you can know that this male has no trouble with either one.

106
0:05:09.32,000 --> 0:05:11,000
He has only trouble with the combination of the two.

107
0:05:12.08,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And so the coalition formation that goes on in chimpanzee society

108
0:05:16.28,000 --> 0:05:18,000
makes it much more complex than you think.

109
0:05:18.36,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It means, for example,

110
0:05:20.2,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that the smallest male in a group can be the alpha male.

111
0:05:23.2,000 --> 0:05:25,000
You don't need to be the biggest and strongest male.

112
0:05:25.68,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The smallest male, if he has the right friends and keeps them happy,

113
0:05:29.4,000 --> 0:05:3,000
or he has female support,

114
0:05:30.92,000 --> 0:05:32,000
he can be the alpha male.

115
0:05:33.28,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So the coalition system makes everything complex,

116
0:05:36.76,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and I'm always waiting here in the US

117
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
for the primaries, the end of the primaries,

118
0:05:41.28,000 --> 0:05:44,000
because that's a moment where you need to demonstrate unity.

119
0:05:45.08,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Now let me first show you how the unity is shown in chimpanzees.

120
0:05:48.68,000 --> 0:05:5,000
What you see here is two males on the left

121
0:05:50.96,000 --> 0:05:51,000
who are standing together.

122
0:05:52.24,000 --> 0:05:54,000
You also see the big canine teeth that they have.

123
0:05:54.64,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And they're standing together and they demonstrate to the rest of the group,

124
0:05:58.24,000 --> 0:06:,000
"We are together. We are a unit."

125
0:06:00.84,000 --> 0:06:02,000
The males on the right are walking together in synchrony.

126
0:06:03.8,000 --> 0:06:05,000
That's another way of demonstrating that you are together.

127
0:06:06.64,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And so demonstrating unity is extremely important

128
0:06:09.88,000 --> 0:06:1,000
in a coalition system,

129
0:06:11.52,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and as I said, in the primaries always I'm waiting for that moment

130
0:06:14.68,000 --> 0:06:16,000
because then you have two members of the same party

131
0:06:17.68,000 --> 0:06:18,000
who have been fighting with each other,

132
0:06:19.6,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and they need to come together at some moment.

133
0:06:22.04,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And it leads to very awkward situations.

134
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:27,000
People who don't like each other need to embrace each other

135
0:06:27.84,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and stand together,

136
0:06:29.12,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and that's absolutely essential for the unity of the party,

137
0:06:32.64,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and if you don't do that, the party may fall apart.

138
0:06:35.2,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And so if it doesn't go well, like in this particular case --

139
0:06:38.12,000 --> 0:06:39,000
(Laughter)

140
0:06:39.44,000 --> 0:06:4,000
then the party is in deep doo-doo

141
0:06:41.24,000 --> 0:06:43,000
because they have not demonstrated unity.

142
0:06:44.32,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So that's a very important part of the coalition system,

143
0:06:47.4,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and that's something that we share between humans and chimpanzees.

144
0:06:51.92,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Now, how do you become an alpha male?

145
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
First of all, you need to be impressive and intimidating

146
0:06:58.88,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and demonstrate your vigor on occasion

147
0:07:00.84,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and show that you are very strong,

148
0:07:02.484,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and there's all sorts of ways of doing that.

149
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:08,000
But other things that you need to do is you need to be generous.

150
0:07:08.08,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So, for example, males who go on a campaign

151
0:07:10.68,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to dethrone the leader,

152
0:07:11.96,000 --> 0:07:13,000
which may take two or three months

153
0:07:14.48,000 --> 0:07:16,000
where they're testing all the coalitions in the group,

154
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
they also become extremely generous.

155
0:07:19.12,000 --> 0:07:21,000
They share food very easily with everyone.

156
0:07:21.8,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Or they start to tickle the babies of the females.

157
0:07:24.84,000 --> 0:07:27,000
They're normally, male chimpanzees, not particularly interested in infants,

158
0:07:28.4,000 --> 0:07:3,000
but when they are campaigning like that,

159
0:07:30.6,000 --> 0:07:32,000
they get very interested in infants and they tickle them,

160
0:07:33.32,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and they try to curry favor with the females.

161
0:07:35.64,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Laughter)

162
0:07:36.68,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So in humans, of course,

163
0:07:37.96,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I am always intrigued by these men who are candidates

164
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and hold babies up like this.

165
0:07:42.44,000 --> 0:07:44,000
This is not particularly something that babies like --

166
0:07:45.04,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Laughter)

167
0:07:46.08,000 --> 0:07:48,000
but since it is a signal to the rest of the world,

168
0:07:48.68,000 --> 0:07:5,000
they need to hold them in the air.

169
0:07:50.72,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And I was really intrigued by,

170
0:07:53.12,000 --> 0:07:55,000
when we had a female candidate in the last election,

171
0:07:55.96,000 --> 0:07:57,000
the way she held babies was more like this,

172
0:07:58.32,000 --> 0:08:,000
which is what babies really like.

173
0:08:00.44,000 --> 0:08:02,000
But she of course didn't need to send the message

174
0:08:02.8,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that she could hold a baby without dropping it,

175
0:08:05.04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
which was what the man was doing.

176
0:08:07.04,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So this is a very common tactic,

177
0:08:08.92,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and male chimpanzees,

178
0:08:10.92,000 --> 0:08:13,000
they spend a lot of time currying favor with all sorts of parties

179
0:08:14.64,000 --> 0:08:15,000
when they are campaigning.

180
0:08:17.32,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Now, what are the privileges and the costs

181
0:08:21.28,000 --> 0:08:22,000
of being an alpha male?

182
0:08:23.96,000 --> 0:08:25,000
The biggest privilege is females.

183
0:08:26.36,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Food is really irrelevant.

184
0:08:27.92,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Male chimpanzees can go a week without food

185
0:08:30.72,000 --> 0:08:33,000
if there's a female in estrus and they're sexually interested in her.

186
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Food is secondary to sex.

187
0:08:36.28,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And so the male chimpanzees --

188
0:08:38.08,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and we evolutionary biologists, of course, we have an explanation for this,

189
0:08:42.12,000 --> 0:08:44,000
is that sex leads to reproduction,

190
0:08:44.84,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and reproductive success is the measure of evolution.

191
0:08:47.4,000 --> 0:08:48,000
That's how everything evolves.

192
0:08:49.159,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And so if males can enhance their reproductive success

193
0:08:51.96,000 --> 0:08:52,000
by being high ranking,

194
0:08:53.4,000 --> 0:08:56,000
you get automatically the ambition to be high ranking in the males.

195
0:08:57.36,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So that's the privilege.

196
0:09:00.04,000 --> 0:09:03,000
The costs, one cost is of course

197
0:09:03.88,000 --> 0:09:05,000
that you need to keep your partners happy.

198
0:09:05.96,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So if you come to power with the support of an old male,

199
0:09:09.84,000 --> 0:09:12,000
you need to let that old male mate with females.

200
0:09:12.88,000 --> 0:09:15,000
If you don't do that, that old male is going to get mad at you,

201
0:09:15.96,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and you're going to lose him as a partner.

202
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So there's a transaction going on.

203
0:09:20.12,000 --> 0:09:23,000
If you become alpha male this way, you need to keep your partners happy.

204
0:09:24.08,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And so that's one of the costs.

205
0:09:25.6,000 --> 0:09:28,000
The second cost is that everyone wants your position.

206
0:09:29.04,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Alpha male position is a very important position,

207
0:09:31.92,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and everyone wants to take it from you,

208
0:09:34.12,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and so you constantly have to watch your back.

209
0:09:36.32,000 --> 0:09:37,000
You have to be extremely vigilant.

210
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:4,000
For example, you have to disrupt the coalitions of others

211
0:09:40.72,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and that's what male chimpanzees do quite a bit.

212
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Divide and rule strategies, they have.

213
0:09:45.12,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And so that's a very stressful situation, and we actually have data on this.

214
0:09:49.48,000 --> 0:09:5,000
The data comes from the field,

215
0:09:51.4,000 --> 0:09:53,000
from baboons not chimpanzees in this case,

216
0:09:54.04,000 --> 0:09:56,000
where they did fecal samples on the baboons

217
0:09:56.56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and they analyzed them for glucocorticoids.

218
0:09:59.28,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And what you see here is a graph

219
0:10:01.6,000 --> 0:10:04,000
where you see that the lower ranking the male baboon is,

220
0:10:05.56,000 --> 0:10:07,000
the higher is his cortisol level

221
0:10:07.72,000 --> 0:10:08,000
in the feces,

222
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:11,000
but the alpha male, as you see,

223
0:10:11.36,000 --> 0:10:14,000
has just as high a level as the lowest-ranking males,

224
0:10:14.52,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and so you may think that being alpha male is nice and dandy and is wonderful,

225
0:10:19.04,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but it's actually a very stressful position,

226
0:10:21.64,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and we can demonstrate that physiologically.

227
0:10:25.24,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Now, what are the obligations?

228
0:10:27.84,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And here, for me, it gets really interesting,

229
0:10:30.36,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and it deviates very much from your typical image of the alpha male.

230
0:10:35.88,000 --> 0:10:37,000
The alpha male has two sorts of obligations.

231
0:10:38.76,000 --> 0:10:39,000
One is to keep the peace in the group.

232
0:10:40.76,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We call that the control role,

233
0:10:42.24,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to control fights in the group,

234
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and the second is to be the most empathic,

235
0:10:46.4,000 --> 0:10:48,000
the consoler in chief, basically, of the nation, so to speak.

236
0:10:49.8,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So first of all, keeping the peace.

237
0:10:51.76,000 --> 0:10:53,000
This is a male who stops a fight between two females.

238
0:10:54.72,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Two females on the left and the right

239
0:10:56.56,000 --> 0:10:58,000
have been screaming and yelling at each other over food,

240
0:10:59.204,000 --> 0:11:01,000
because food is very important for the females,

241
0:11:01.72,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and so he stops the fight between them and stands between them like this.

242
0:11:05.44,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And it's very interesting to me that alpha males, when they do this,

243
0:11:08.655,000 --> 0:11:09,000
they become impartial.

244
0:11:10.48,000 --> 0:11:12,000
They don't support their mom or their best buddy.

245
0:11:13.08,000 --> 0:11:15,000
No, no, they stop fights,

246
0:11:15.72,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and they come up for the underdog in general.

247
0:11:17.88,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And this makes them extremely popular in the group,

248
0:11:21.08,000 --> 0:11:22,000
because they provide security

249
0:11:23.08,000 --> 0:11:25,000
for the lowest-ranking members of the group.

250
0:11:25.6,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And so they become impartial,

251
0:11:27.44,000 --> 0:11:29,000
which is an unusual condition for a chimpanzee to be in,

252
0:11:30.12,000 --> 0:11:32,000
because they're usually very fond of their friends and so on,

253
0:11:33.12,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and these alpha males who are good at this,

254
0:11:35.2,000 --> 0:11:37,000
they can be very effective at keeping the peace in the group.

255
0:11:38.12,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And the second thing they do is they show empathy for others.

256
0:11:41.4,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Now, I do an enormous amount of research on empathy,

257
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and I don't have time to go into it,

258
0:11:45.92,000 --> 0:11:49,000
but empathy is nowadays a topic that we study in rodents and dogs

259
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and elephants and primates,

260
0:11:52.12,000 --> 0:11:53,000
all sorts of animals.

261
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And what you see here is two bonobos.

262
0:11:56.84,000 --> 0:11:58,000
The one in front

263
0:11:59.04,000 --> 0:12:,000
has been beaten up in a fight.

264
0:12:00.52,000 --> 0:12:03,000
The one in the back puts her arms around her and consoles her.

265
0:12:03.84,000 --> 0:12:06,000
This is also actually how we measure empathy in young children,

266
0:12:07.52,000 --> 0:12:1,000
by looking at how they respond to distressed individuals.

267
0:12:11.04,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And high-ranking males, they do a lot of this.

268
0:12:13.36,000 --> 0:12:17,000
High-ranking males provide an enormous amount of comfort in the group,

269
0:12:17.8,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and they go to places where there are earthquakes

270
0:12:20.24,000 --> 0:12:22,000
or hurricanes

271
0:12:22.32,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and they provide comfort.

272
0:12:23.96,000 --> 0:12:25,000
The pope does this. The presidents do this.

273
0:12:26.12,000 --> 0:12:28,000
All the leaders in the world have to do this job.

274
0:12:28.48,000 --> 0:12:29,000
The queen does it and so on.

275
0:12:30.32,000 --> 0:12:31,000
They all have to do this job,

276
0:12:31.76,000 --> 0:12:34,000
so providing consolation, and that's a very important task.

277
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And males who are good at these two,

278
0:12:37.2,000 --> 0:12:39,000
keeping the peace and providing comfort,

279
0:12:39.64,000 --> 0:12:41,000
they become extremely popular leaders,

280
0:12:41.68,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and there's actually some self-interest involved in it.

281
0:12:44.52,000 --> 0:12:45,000
They don't do it just for the group,

282
0:12:46.36,000 --> 0:12:48,000
because it also stabilizes their position.

283
0:12:49.4,000 --> 0:12:51,000
The more popular a male becomes as alpha male

284
0:12:52.24,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and the more the rest of them respects them and looks up to them,

285
0:12:56.96,000 --> 0:12:57,000
the better their position is defended

286
0:12:58.8,000 --> 0:13:,000
in case it's going to be challenged by somebody else,

287
0:13:01.32,000 --> 0:13:04,000
because then, of course, the whole group is going to support that male

288
0:13:04.64,000 --> 0:13:06,000
because they want to keep a leader who is good for them.

289
0:13:07.32,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So the group is usually very supportive of males who are good leaders,

290
0:13:10.7,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and it's not supportive at all of bullies.

291
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And when bullies lose their position,

292
0:13:14.84,000 --> 0:13:16,000
they may end up in a very bad situation there.

293
0:13:17.84,000 --> 0:13:19,000
This is data actually on the consolation behavior.

294
0:13:20.4,000 --> 0:13:22,000
This is data on consolation in chimpanzees,

295
0:13:23.36,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and you see for the medium- and low-ranking individuals,

296
0:13:26.52,000 --> 0:13:28,000
the females do more of it than the males.

297
0:13:28.6,000 --> 0:13:3,000
This is basically the whole community.

298
0:13:30.68,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And this is true for all the mammal studies on empathy

299
0:13:33.6,000 --> 0:13:35,000
is that females have more of it than males.

300
0:13:35.96,000 --> 0:13:36,000
But look at the alpha male.

301
0:13:37.6,000 --> 0:13:39,000
The alpha male does far more than anybody else.

302
0:13:40.08,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And so that's the data on alpha males being the consoler in chief, basically.

303
0:13:46.44,000 --> 0:13:48,000
The last thing I want to say is something about alpha females.

304
0:13:50.08,000 --> 0:13:53,000
This is a picture of Mama, the alpha female in the Arnhem zoo

305
0:13:53.56,000 --> 0:13:54,000
where I used to work,

306
0:13:54.8,000 --> 0:13:55,000
who is now all over the internet,

307
0:13:56.44,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I think a hundred million clicks at the moment,

308
0:13:58.68,000 --> 0:14:,000
for a video of her dying at the age of 59,

309
0:14:01.2,000 --> 0:14:02,000
which happened last year.

310
0:14:02.8,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And Mama was an absolute centrum of the group.

311
0:14:05.68,000 --> 0:14:09,000
So she was not physically capable of dominating the males.

312
0:14:10.12,000 --> 0:14:13,000
She ranked below the males, but she was the center of the community,

313
0:14:14.04,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and if there was big trouble in the community,

314
0:14:16.24,000 --> 0:14:18,000
everyone would end up in the arms of Mama.

315
0:14:18.56,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And so she was a very important figure.

316
0:14:20.8,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And so I don't want to minimize the position of alpha females

317
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:25,000
in the chimpanzee group.

318
0:14:25.4,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And then we have a species that is equally close to us

319
0:14:28.8,000 --> 0:14:29,000
as the chimpanzee, the bonobo.

320
0:14:30.28,000 --> 0:14:34,000
We often forget about the bonobo, but the bonobos have a matriarchal society

321
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and the alpha individual is a female, generally.

322
0:14:39.56,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Generally, it's a female who is at the top of the community,

323
0:14:42.44,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and we know much less about how this is done

324
0:14:44.56,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and how they get to that position, and what they do with it,

325
0:14:47.44,000 --> 0:14:49,000
because we know much less about bonobos in general.

326
0:14:50.32,000 --> 0:14:51,000
But I do want to emphasize

327
0:14:51.68,000 --> 0:14:54,000
that the alpha in a group doesn't need to be a male,

328
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and that actually in one of our close relatives, it is a female.

329
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
So the message I want to leave you with

330
0:15:01.64,000 --> 0:15:05,000
is that if you are looking at men in our society

331
0:15:07.68,000 --> 0:15:08,000
who are the boss of, let's say,

332
0:15:09.2,000 --> 0:15:12,000
a family or a business or Washington or whatever,

333
0:15:12.92,000 --> 0:15:14,000
you call them alpha male,

334
0:15:15.32,000 --> 0:15:17,000
you should not insult chimpanzees

335
0:15:17.68,000 --> 0:15:18,000
by using the wrong label.

336
0:15:19.44,000 --> 0:15:2,000
(Laughter)

337
0:15:20.68,000 --> 0:15:22,000
You should not call a bully an alpha male.

338
0:15:23.96,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Someone who is big and strong and intimidates and insults everyone

339
0:15:27.6,000 --> 0:15:28,000
is not necessarily an alpha male.

340
0:15:29.24,000 --> 0:15:31,000
An alpha male has all sorts of qualities,

341
0:15:31.32,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and I have seen bully alpha males in chimpanzees,

342
0:15:34.32,000 --> 0:15:35,000
they do occur,

343
0:15:35.6,000 --> 0:15:37,000
but most of the ones that we have

344
0:15:38.36,000 --> 0:15:39,000
have leadership capacities

345
0:15:40.32,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and are integrated in their community,

346
0:15:42.36,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and, like Amos at the end,

347
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
they are loved and respected,

348
0:15:45.96,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and so it's a very different situation than you may think.

349
0:15:48.72,000 --> 0:15:49,000
And I thank you.

350
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:53,000
(Applause)

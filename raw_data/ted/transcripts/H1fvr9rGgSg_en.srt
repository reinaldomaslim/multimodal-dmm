1
0:00:12.777,000 --> 0:00:13,000
The following are my opinions,

2
0:00:14.686,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and do not reflect the opinions or policies

3
0:00:16.717,000 --> 0:00:17,000
of any particular prosecutor's office.

4
0:00:18.725,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:21.452,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I am a prosecutor.

6
0:00:23.146,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I believe in law and order.

7
0:00:24.716,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I am the adopted son of a police officer, a Marine and a hairdresser.

8
0:00:29.139,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I believe in accountability

9
0:00:32.103,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and that we should all be safe in our communities.

10
0:00:36.145,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I love my job

11
0:00:38.487,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and the people that do it.

12
0:00:40.5,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I just think that it's our responsibility

13
0:00:42.498,000 --> 0:00:43,000
to do it better.

14
0:00:45.213,000 --> 0:00:47,000
By a show of hands,

15
0:00:47.286,000 --> 0:00:49,000
how many of you, by the age of 25,

16
0:00:50.024,000 --> 0:00:51,000
had either acted up in school,

17
0:00:51.912,000 --> 0:00:53,000
went somewhere you were specifically told to stay out of,

18
0:00:54.675,000 --> 0:00:57,000
or drank alcohol before your legal age?

19
0:00:58.409,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

20
0:00:59.814,000 --> 0:01:,000
All right.

21
0:01:01.52,000 --> 0:01:03,000
How many of you shoplifted,

22
0:01:03.783,000 --> 0:01:05,000
tried an illegal drug

23
0:01:05.807,000 --> 0:01:06,000
or got into a physical fight --

24
0:01:07.51,000 --> 0:01:08,000
yes, even with a sibling?

25
0:01:10.659,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Now, how many of you ever spent one day in jail

26
0:01:14.624,000 --> 0:01:15,000
for any of those decisions?

27
0:01:21.809,000 --> 0:01:22,000
How many of you sitting here today

28
0:01:23.467,000 --> 0:01:24,000
think that you're a danger to society

29
0:01:25.302,000 --> 0:01:28,000
or should be defined by those actions of youthful indiscretion?

30
0:01:29.907,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:32.185,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Point taken.

32
0:01:35.504,000 --> 0:01:37,000
When we talk about criminal justice reform,

33
0:01:37.833,000 --> 0:01:39,000
we often focus on a few things,

34
0:01:40.379,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and that's what I want to talk to you about today.

35
0:01:44.783,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But first I'm going to -- since you shared with me,

36
0:01:47.194,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I'm going to give you a confession on my part.

37
0:01:49.385,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I went to law school

38
0:01:50.813,000 --> 0:01:51,000
to make money.

39
0:01:52.725,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I had no interest in being a public servant,

40
0:01:54.82,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I had no interest in criminal law,

41
0:01:56.531,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and I definitely didn't think that I would ever be a prosecutor.

42
0:02:00.888,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Near the end of my first year of law school, I got an internship

43
0:02:03.918,000 --> 0:02:05,000
in the Roxbury Division of Boston Municipal Court.

44
0:02:06.921,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I knew of Roxbury as an impoverished neighborhood in Boston,

45
0:02:10.465,000 --> 0:02:13,000
plagued by gun violence and drug crime.

46
0:02:15.835,000 --> 0:02:19,000
My life and my legal career changed the first day of that internship.

47
0:02:21.973,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I walked into a courtroom, and I saw an auditorium of people

48
0:02:25.919,000 --> 0:02:27,000
who, one by one, would approach the front of that courtroom

49
0:02:28.776,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to say two words and two words only:

50
0:02:30.536,000 --> 0:02:31,000
"Not guilty."

51
0:02:32.352,000 --> 0:02:34,000
They were predominately black and brown.

52
0:02:36.152,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And then a judge, a defense attorney and a prosecutor

53
0:02:38.686,000 --> 0:02:41,000
would make life-altering decisions about that person without their input.

54
0:02:43.571,000 --> 0:02:44,000
They were predominately white.

55
0:02:47.23,000 --> 0:02:5,000
As each person, one by one, approached the front of that courtroom,

56
0:02:50.417,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I couldn't stop but think:

57
0:02:52.019,000 --> 0:02:53,000
How did they get here?

58
0:02:53.194,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I wanted to know their stories.

59
0:02:55.773,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And as the prosecutor read the facts of each case,

60
0:02:59.762,000 --> 0:03:,000
I was thinking to myself,

61
0:03:01.549,000 --> 0:03:02,000
we could have predicted that.

62
0:03:04.099,000 --> 0:03:05,000
That seems so preventable...

63
0:03:07.575,000 --> 0:03:09,000
not because I was an expert in criminal law,

64
0:03:09.758,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but because it was common sense.

65
0:03:13.525,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Over the course of the internship,

66
0:03:15.193,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I began to recognize people in the auditorium,

67
0:03:17.371,000 --> 0:03:19,000
not because they were criminal masterminds

68
0:03:19.487,000 --> 0:03:21,000
but because they were coming to us for help

69
0:03:21.511,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and we were sending them out without any.

70
0:03:25.774,000 --> 0:03:28,000
My second year of law school I worked as a paralegal for a defense attorney,

71
0:03:29.377,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and in that experience I met many young men accused of murder.

72
0:03:32.69,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Even in our "worst," I saw human stories.

73
0:03:36.642,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And they all contained childhood trauma,

74
0:03:39.542,000 --> 0:03:41,000
victimization, poverty, loss,

75
0:03:41.802,000 --> 0:03:42,000
disengagement from school,

76
0:03:43.524,000 --> 0:03:46,000
early interaction with the police and the criminal justice system,

77
0:03:46.683,000 --> 0:03:48,000
all leading to a seat in a courtroom.

78
0:03:49.862,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Those convicted of murder were condemned to die in prison,

79
0:03:52.876,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and it was during those meetings with those men that I couldn't fathom

80
0:03:57.018,000 --> 0:03:58,000
why we would spend so much money

81
0:03:58.829,000 --> 0:04:,000
to keep this one person in jail for the next 80 years

82
0:04:01.575,000 --> 0:04:03,000
when we could have reinvested it up front,

83
0:04:03.606,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and perhaps prevented the whole thing from happening in the first place.

84
0:04:07.108,000 --> 0:04:11,000
(Applause)

85
0:04:12.715,000 --> 0:04:13,000
My third year of law school,

86
0:04:14.084,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I defended people accused of small street crimes,

87
0:04:16.736,000 --> 0:04:17,000
mostly mentally ill,

88
0:04:17.911,000 --> 0:04:18,000
mostly homeless,

89
0:04:19.086,000 --> 0:04:2,000
mostly drug-addicted,

90
0:04:20.261,000 --> 0:04:21,000
all in need of help.

91
0:04:23.194,000 --> 0:04:24,000
They would come to us,

92
0:04:24.925,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and we would send them away without that help.

93
0:04:28.557,000 --> 0:04:3,000
They were in need of our assistance.

94
0:04:32.621,000 --> 0:04:34,000
But we weren't giving them any.

95
0:04:36.933,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Prosecuted, adjudged and defended

96
0:04:40.09,000 --> 0:04:43,000
by people who knew nothing about them.

97
0:04:44.493,000 --> 0:04:47,000
The staggering inefficiency is what drove me to criminal justice work.

98
0:04:48.425,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The unfairness of it all made me want to be a defender.

99
0:04:52.382,000 --> 0:04:54,000
The power dynamic that I came to understand

100
0:04:56.156,000 --> 0:04:57,000
made me become a prosecutor.

101
0:04:59.383,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about the problem.

102
0:05:02.338,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We know the criminal justice system needs reform,

103
0:05:04.702,000 --> 0:05:07,000
we know there are 2.3 million people in American jails and prisons,

104
0:05:07.932,000 --> 0:05:09,000
making us the most incarcerated nation on the planet.

105
0:05:10.535,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We know there's another seven million people on probation or parole,

106
0:05:13.836,000 --> 0:05:15,000
we know that the criminal justice system

107
0:05:16.074,000 --> 0:05:18,000
disproportionately affects people of color,

108
0:05:18.106,000 --> 0:05:19,000
particularly poor people of color.

109
0:05:19.754,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And we know there are system failures happening everywhere

110
0:05:22.532,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that bring people to our courtrooms.

111
0:05:24.326,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But what we do not discuss

112
0:05:25.612,000 --> 0:05:27,000
is how ill-equipped our prosecutors are to receive them.

113
0:05:29.151,000 --> 0:05:31,000
When we talk about criminal justice reform,

114
0:05:31.199,000 --> 0:05:33,000
we, as a society, focus on three things.

115
0:05:33.53,000 --> 0:05:34,000
We complain, we tweet, we protest

116
0:05:35.366,000 --> 0:05:37,000
about the police, about sentencing laws

117
0:05:37.519,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and about prison.

118
0:05:40.031,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We rarely, if ever, talk about the prosecutor.

119
0:05:46.367,000 --> 0:05:47,000
In the fall of 2009,

120
0:05:48.735,000 --> 0:05:51,000
a young man was arrested by the Boston Police Department.

121
0:05:51.785,000 --> 0:05:53,000
He was 18 years old, he was African American

122
0:05:54.112,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and he was a senior at a local public school.

123
0:05:56.706,000 --> 0:05:57,000
He had his sights set on college

124
0:05:58.654,000 --> 0:06:01,000
but his part-time, minimum-wage job wasn't providing the financial opportunity

125
0:06:02.402,000 --> 0:06:03,000
he needed to enroll in school.

126
0:06:04.709,000 --> 0:06:05,000
In a series of bad decisions,

127
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
he stole 30 laptops from a store and sold them on the Internet.

128
0:06:10.424,000 --> 0:06:11,000
This led to his arrest

129
0:06:11.937,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and a criminal complaint of 30 felony charges.

130
0:06:17.677,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The potential jail time he faced is what stressed Christopher out the most.

131
0:06:21.249,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But what he had little understanding of

132
0:06:23.367,000 --> 0:06:26,000
was the impact a criminal record would have on his future.

133
0:06:28.311,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I was standing in arraignments that day

134
0:06:30.228,000 --> 0:06:32,000
when Christopher's case came across my desk.

135
0:06:32.348,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And at the risk of sounding dramatic, in that moment,

136
0:06:34.888,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I had Christopher's life in my hands.

137
0:06:37.505,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I was 29 years old, a brand-new prosecutor,

138
0:06:39.78,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and I had little appreciation for how the decisions I would make

139
0:06:42.9,000 --> 0:06:44,000
would impact Christopher's life.

140
0:06:46.906,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Christopher's case was a serious one

141
0:06:48.746,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and it needed to be dealt with as such,

142
0:06:50.651,000 --> 0:06:53,000
but I didn't think branding him a felon for the rest of his life

143
0:06:53.714,000 --> 0:06:54,000
was the right answer.

144
0:06:56.4,000 --> 0:06:58,000
For the most part, prosecutors step onto the job

145
0:06:58.687,000 --> 0:07:,000
with little appreciation of the impact of our decisions,

146
0:07:01.362,000 --> 0:07:02,000
regardless of our intent.

147
0:07:02.695,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Despite our broad discretion,

148
0:07:04.234,000 --> 0:07:07,000
we learn to avoid risk at all cost,

149
0:07:07.43,000 --> 0:07:08,000
rendering our discretion

150
0:07:09.192,000 --> 0:07:1,000
basically useless.

151
0:07:11.971,000 --> 0:07:13,000
History has conditioned us to believe that somehow,

152
0:07:14.387,000 --> 0:07:16,000
the criminal justice system brings about accountability

153
0:07:17.198,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and improves public safety,

154
0:07:18.552,000 --> 0:07:19,000
despite evidence to the contrary.

155
0:07:21.1,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We're judged internally and externally by our convictions and our trial wins,

156
0:07:24.768,000 --> 0:07:27,000
so prosecutors aren't really incentivized to be creative

157
0:07:28.29,000 --> 0:07:3,000
at our case dispositions,

158
0:07:30.421,000 --> 0:07:33,000
or to take risks on people we might not otherwise.

159
0:07:34.666,000 --> 0:07:35,000
We stick to an outdated method,

160
0:07:36.187,000 --> 0:07:39,000
counterproductive to achieving the very goal that we all want,

161
0:07:39.342,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and that's safer communities.

162
0:07:42.004,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Yet most prosecutors standing in my space would have arraigned Christopher.

163
0:07:46.897,000 --> 0:07:49,000
They have little appreciation for what we can do.

164
0:07:50.299,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Arraigning Christopher would give him a criminal record,

165
0:07:54.426,000 --> 0:07:56,000
making it harder for him to get a job,

166
0:07:57.02,000 --> 0:07:58,000
setting in motion a cycle

167
0:07:58.733,000 --> 0:08:,000
that defines the failing criminal justice system today.

168
0:08:04.073,000 --> 0:08:05,000
With a criminal record and without a job,

169
0:08:06.082,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Christopher would be unable to find employment, education or stable housing.

170
0:08:10.627,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Without those protective factors in his life,

171
0:08:12.77,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Christopher would be more likely to commit further, more serious crime.

172
0:08:16.164,000 --> 0:08:19,000
The more contact Christopher had with the criminal justice system,

173
0:08:19.313,000 --> 0:08:21,000
the more likely it would be that he would return again

174
0:08:21.881,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and again and again --

175
0:08:23.874,000 --> 0:08:26,000
all at tremendous social cost to his children, to his family

176
0:08:27.702,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and to his peers.

177
0:08:28.877,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And, ladies and gentlemen,

178
0:08:30.206,000 --> 0:08:33,000
it is a terrible public safety outcome for the rest of us.

179
0:08:36.509,000 --> 0:08:38,000
When I came out of law school,

180
0:08:38.808,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I did the same thing as everybody else.

181
0:08:41.546,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I came out as a prosecutor expected to do justice,

182
0:08:44.026,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but I never learned what justice was in my classes --

183
0:08:46.553,000 --> 0:08:47,000
none of us do.

184
0:08:48.203,000 --> 0:08:49,000
None of us do.

185
0:08:50.96,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And yet, prosecutors are the most powerful actors

186
0:08:53.471,000 --> 0:08:54,000
in the criminal justice system.

187
0:08:56.229,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Our power is virtually boundless.

188
0:08:57.946,000 --> 0:08:58,000
In most cases, not the judge,

189
0:08:59.423,000 --> 0:09:,000
not the police, not the legislature,

190
0:09:01.177,000 --> 0:09:03,000
not the mayor, not the governor, not the President

191
0:09:03.574,000 --> 0:09:04,000
can tell us how to prosecute our cases.

192
0:09:07.006,000 --> 0:09:1,000
The decision to arraign Christopher and give him a criminal record

193
0:09:10.146,000 --> 0:09:11,000
was exclusively mine.

194
0:09:12.343,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I would choose whether to prosecute him for 30 felonies, for one felony,

195
0:09:15.853,000 --> 0:09:16,000
for a misdemeanor,

196
0:09:17.028,000 --> 0:09:18,000
or at all.

197
0:09:18.229,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I would choose whether to leverage Christopher into a plea deal

198
0:09:21.229,000 --> 0:09:23,000
or take the case to trial, and ultimately,

199
0:09:23.282,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I would be in a position to ask for Christopher to go to jail.

200
0:09:27.92,000 --> 0:09:3,000
These are decisions that prosecutors make every day unfettered,

201
0:09:32.613,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and we are unaware and untrained

202
0:09:35.446,000 --> 0:09:37,000
of the grave consequences of those decisions.

203
0:09:40.498,000 --> 0:09:41,000
One night this past summer,

204
0:09:41.844,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I was at a small gathering of professional men of color

205
0:09:45.77,000 --> 0:09:46,000
from around the city.

206
0:09:47.381,000 --> 0:09:49,000
As I stood there stuffing free finger sandwiches into my mouth,

207
0:09:50.362,000 --> 0:09:51,000
as you do as public servant --

208
0:09:51.869,000 --> 0:09:52,000
(Laughter)

209
0:09:52.909,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I noticed across the room,

210
0:09:54.496,000 --> 0:09:57,000
a young man waving and smiling at me and approaching me.

211
0:09:59.527,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And I recognized him, but I couldn't place from where,

212
0:10:02.575,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and before I knew it, this young man was hugging me.

213
0:10:07.134,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And thanking me.

214
0:10:09.766,000 --> 0:10:11,000
"You cared about me, and you changed my life."

215
0:10:13.339,000 --> 0:10:14,000
It was Christopher.

216
0:10:15.836,000 --> 0:10:16,000
See, I never arraigned Christopher.

217
0:10:17.546,000 --> 0:10:18,000
He never faced a judge or a jail,

218
0:10:19.17,000 --> 0:10:2,000
he never had a criminal record.

219
0:10:21.133,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Instead, I worked with Christopher;

220
0:10:22.915,000 --> 0:10:24,000
first on being accountable for his actions,

221
0:10:25.658,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and then, putting him in a position where he wouldn't re-offend.

222
0:10:29.665,000 --> 0:10:31,000
We recovered 75 percent of the computers that he sold

223
0:10:32.642,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and gave them back to Best Buy,

224
0:10:34.169,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and came up with a financial plan

225
0:10:35.797,000 --> 0:10:37,000
to repay for the computers we couldn't recover.

226
0:10:38.036,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Christopher did community service.

227
0:10:39.775,000 --> 0:10:42,000
He wrote an essay reflecting on how this case could impact his future

228
0:10:43.078,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and that of the community.

229
0:10:44.453,000 --> 0:10:45,000
He applied to college,

230
0:10:45.684,000 --> 0:10:46,000
he obtained financial aid,

231
0:10:46.968,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and he went on to graduate from a four-year school.

232
0:10:50.523,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Applause)

233
0:10:57.574,000 --> 0:10:59,000
After we finished hugging, I looked at his name tag,

234
0:11:00.038,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to learn that Christopher was the manager of a large bank in Boston.

235
0:11:03.311,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Christopher had accomplished -- and making a lot more money than me --

236
0:11:06.635,000 --> 0:11:07,000
(Laughter)

237
0:11:07.66,000 --> 0:11:08,000
He had accomplished all of this

238
0:11:09.19,000 --> 0:11:12,000
in the six years since I had first seen him in Roxbury Court.

239
0:11:12.909,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I can't take credit for Christopher's journey to success,

240
0:11:16.731,000 --> 0:11:19,000
but I certainly did my part to keep him on the path.

241
0:11:20.992,000 --> 0:11:23,000
There are thousands of Christophers out there,

242
0:11:24.593,000 --> 0:11:25,000
some locked in our jails and prisons.

243
0:11:26.398,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We need thousands of prosecutors

244
0:11:28.287,000 --> 0:11:3,000
to recognize that and to protect them.

245
0:11:32.508,000 --> 0:11:35,000
An employed Christopher is better for public safety than a condemned one.

246
0:11:36.462,000 --> 0:11:38,000
It's a bigger win for all of us.

247
0:11:40.438,000 --> 0:11:43,000
In retrospect, the decision not to throw the book at Christopher

248
0:11:43.543,000 --> 0:11:44,000
makes perfect sense.

249
0:11:44.718,000 --> 0:11:46,000
When I saw him that first day in Roxbury Court,

250
0:11:46.954,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I didn't see a criminal standing there.

251
0:11:48.85,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I saw myself -- a young person in need of intervention.

252
0:11:51.669,000 --> 0:11:55,000
As an individual caught selling a large quantity of drugs in my late teens,

253
0:11:56.006,000 --> 0:11:58,000
I knew firsthand the power of opportunity

254
0:11:58.955,000 --> 0:12:,000
as opposed to the wrath of the criminal justice system.

255
0:12:04.341,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Along the way, with the help and guidance of my district attorney,

256
0:12:08.276,000 --> 0:12:1,000
my supervisor and judges,

257
0:12:11.273,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I learned the power of the prosecutor

258
0:12:13.824,000 --> 0:12:15,000
to change lives instead of ruining them.

259
0:12:18.542,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And that's how we do it in Boston.

260
0:12:21.206,000 --> 0:12:24,000
We helped a woman who was arrested for stealing groceries to feed her kids

261
0:12:24.775,000 --> 0:12:25,000
get a job.

262
0:12:26.401,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Instead of putting an abused teenager in adult jail

263
0:12:29.573,000 --> 0:12:3,000
for punching another teenager,

264
0:12:31.05,000 --> 0:12:33,000
we secured mental health treatment and community supervision.

265
0:12:34.288,000 --> 0:12:35,000
A runaway girl who was arrested

266
0:12:35.959,000 --> 0:12:37,000
for prostituting, to survive on the streets,

267
0:12:38.086,000 --> 0:12:4,000
needed a safe place to live and grow --

268
0:12:40.851,000 --> 0:12:42,000
something we could help her with.

269
0:12:42.878,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I even helped a young man

270
0:12:44.378,000 --> 0:12:47,000
who was so afraid of the older gang kids showing up after school,

271
0:12:47.505,000 --> 0:12:49,000
that one morning instead of a lunchbox into his backpack,

272
0:12:50.204,000 --> 0:12:51,000
he put a loaded 9-millimeter.

273
0:12:53.467,000 --> 0:12:57,000
We would spend our time that we'd normally take prepping our cases

274
0:12:57.527,000 --> 0:12:59,000
for months and months for trial down the road

275
0:12:59.718,000 --> 0:13:02,000
by coming up with real solutions to the problems as they presented.

276
0:13:04.699,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Which is the better way to spend our time?

277
0:13:07.969,000 --> 0:13:09,000
How would you prefer your prosecutors to spend theirs?

278
0:13:11.901,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Why are we spending 80 billion dollars

279
0:13:14.293,000 --> 0:13:16,000
on a prison industry that we know is failing,

280
0:13:16.759,000 --> 0:13:19,000
when we could take that money and reallocate it into education,

281
0:13:20.347,000 --> 0:13:21,000
into mental health treatment,

282
0:13:21.78,000 --> 0:13:22,000
into substance abuse treatment

283
0:13:23.301,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and to community investment so we can develop our neighborhoods?

284
0:13:26.383,000 --> 0:13:32,000
(Applause)

285
0:13:33.616,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So why should this matter to you?

286
0:13:35.244,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Well, one, we're spending a lot of money.

287
0:13:39.294,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Our money.

288
0:13:41.063,000 --> 0:13:43,000
It costs 109,000 dollars in some states

289
0:13:43.493,000 --> 0:13:44,000
to lock up a teenager for a year,

290
0:13:45.107,000 --> 0:13:49,000
with a 60 percent chance that that person will return to the very same system.

291
0:13:49.583,000 --> 0:13:52,000
That is a terrible return on investment.

292
0:13:54.706,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Number two: it's the right thing to do.

293
0:13:57.004,000 --> 0:13:59,000
If prosecutors were a part of creating the problem,

294
0:13:59.983,000 --> 0:14:01,000
it's incumbent on us to create a solution

295
0:14:02.236,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and we can do that using other disciplines

296
0:14:04.307,000 --> 0:14:06,000
that have already done the data and research for us.

297
0:14:06.847,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And number three:

298
0:14:08.04,000 --> 0:14:1,000
your voice and your vote can make that happen.

299
0:14:10.665,000 --> 0:14:12,000
The next time there's a local district attorney's election

300
0:14:13.369,000 --> 0:14:14,000
in your jurisdiction,

301
0:14:14.545,000 --> 0:14:15,000
ask candidates these questions.

302
0:14:16.063,000 --> 0:14:19,000
One: What are you doing to make me and my neighbors safer?

303
0:14:19.274,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Two: What data are you collecting,

304
0:14:21.678,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and how are you training your prosecutors

305
0:14:23.923,000 --> 0:14:24,000
to make sure that it's working?

306
0:14:25.618,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And number three:

307
0:14:26.807,000 --> 0:14:27,000
If it's not working for everybody,

308
0:14:28.687,000 --> 0:14:29,000
what are you doing to fix it?

309
0:14:30.562,000 --> 0:14:31,000
If they can't answer the questions,

310
0:14:32.298,000 --> 0:14:33,000
they shouldn't be doing the job.

311
0:14:35.48,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Each one of you that raised your hand at the beginning of this talk

312
0:14:38.721,000 --> 0:14:41,000
is a living, breathing example of the power of opportunity,

313
0:14:42.183,000 --> 0:14:43,000
of intervention,

314
0:14:43.358,000 --> 0:14:44,000
of support

315
0:14:44.533,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and of love.

316
0:14:45.838,000 --> 0:14:47,000
While each of you may have faced your own brand of discipline

317
0:14:48.763,000 --> 0:14:5,000
for whatever malfeasances you committed,

318
0:14:50.9,000 --> 0:14:51,000
barely any of you needed a day in jail

319
0:14:52.789,000 --> 0:14:54,000
to make you the people that you are today --

320
0:14:54.892,000 --> 0:14:56,000
some of the greatest minds on the planet.

321
0:14:57.748,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Every day, thousands of times a day,

322
0:14:59.651,000 --> 0:15:01,000
prosecutors around the United States wield power so great

323
0:15:02.621,000 --> 0:15:03,000
that it can bring about catastrophe

324
0:15:04.385,000 --> 0:15:06,000
as quickly as it can bring about opportunity,

325
0:15:06.987,000 --> 0:15:07,000
intervention,

326
0:15:08.243,000 --> 0:15:09,000
support

327
0:15:09.426,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and yes, even love.

328
0:15:12.758,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Those qualities are the hallmarks of a strong community,

329
0:15:15.688,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and a strong community is a safe one.

330
0:15:17.506,000 --> 0:15:18,000
If our communities are broken,

331
0:15:18.986,000 --> 0:15:2,000
don't let the lawyers that you elect fix them

332
0:15:21.107,000 --> 0:15:23,000
with outdated, inefficient, expensive methods.

333
0:15:23.314,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Demand more; vote for the prosecutor who's helping people stay out of jail,

334
0:15:26.981,000 --> 0:15:27,000
not putting them in.

335
0:15:28.157,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Demand better.

336
0:15:29.332,000 --> 0:15:31,000
You deserve it, your children deserve it,

337
0:15:31.362,000 --> 0:15:33,000
the people who are tied up in the system deserve it,

338
0:15:33.824,000 --> 0:15:34,000
but most of all,

339
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:38,000
the people that we are sworn to protect and do justice for demand it.

340
0:15:38.271,000 --> 0:15:39,000
We must,

341
0:15:39.446,000 --> 0:15:4,000
we must do better.

342
0:15:40.852,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Thank you.

343
0:15:42.033,000 --> 0:15:43,000
(Applause)

344
0:15:46.549,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Thank you.

345
0:15:48.012,000 --> 0:15:5,000
(Applause)

346
0:15:51.213,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Thank you very much.

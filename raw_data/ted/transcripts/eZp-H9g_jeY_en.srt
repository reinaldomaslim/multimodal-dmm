1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:32,000
About 15 years ago, I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong.

2
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And at the time I was very superstitious.

3
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So, upon landing -- this was still at the old Hong Kong airport

4
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that's Kai Tak, when it was smack in the middle of the city --

5
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I thought, "If I see something good, I'm going to have a great time here in

6
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:57,000
my two weeks. And if I see something negative, I'm going to be miserable, indeed."

7
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So the plane landed in between the buildings

8
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard.

9
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

10
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And I actually went to see some of the design companies

11
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
in Hong Kong in my stay there.

12
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And it turned out that --

13
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I just went to see, you know, what they are doing in Hong Kong.

14
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But I actually walked away with a great job offer.

15
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And I flew back to Austria, packed my bags,

16
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and, another week later, I was again on my way to Hong Kong

17
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:41,000
still superstitions and thinking, "Well, if that 'Winner' billboard is still up,

18
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I'm going to have a good time working here.

19
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But if it's gone, it's going to be really miserable and stressful."

21
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So it turned out that not only was the billboard still up

22
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:56,000
but they had put this one right next to it.

23
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:03,000
On the other hand, it also taught me where superstition gets me

25
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:05,000
because I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong.

26
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Laughter)

27
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:19,000
However, I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life --

28
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:24,000
of, you know, I think what the conference brochure refers to

29
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
as "moments that take your breath away."

30
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And since I'm a big list maker, I actually listed them all.

31
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Laughter)

32
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Now, you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them

33
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and I won't read them for you.

34
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people's happinesses.

35
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:47,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:56,000
What I did do, though is, I actually looked at them from a design standpoint

37
0:02:56,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design.

38
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And, very surprisingly, over half of them had, actually, something to do with design.

39
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So there are, of course, two different possibilities.

40
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
There's one from a consumer's point of view --

41
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:17,000
where I was happy while experiencing design.

42
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And I'll just give you one example. I had gotten my first Walkman.

43
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:23,000
This is 1983.

44
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:26,000
My brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle

45
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that he was willing to borrow to me freely.

46
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And The Police's "Synchronicity"

47
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
cassette had just been released

48
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz.

49
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So you could drive up into the mountains

50
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:43,000
freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman.

51
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

52
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And I remember it as a true moment of happiness.

53
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You know, of course, they are related to this combination of

54
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:58,000
at least two of them being, you know, design objects.

55
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And, you know, there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design

56
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but the motorcycle incident would definitely be, you know,

57
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:12,000
situated somewhere here -- right in there between Delight and Bliss.

58
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Now, there is the other part, from a designer's standpoint --

59
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:2,000
if you're happy while actually doing it.

60
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And one way to see how happy designers are when they're designing could be to

61
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:31,000
look at the authors' photos on the back of their monographs?

62
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:32,000
(Laughter)

63
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So, according to this, the Australians and the Japanese

64
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:38,000
as well as the Mexicans

65
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:4,000
are very happy.

66
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Laughter)

67
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:43,000
While, somewhat, the Spaniards ...

68
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and, I think, particularly, the Swiss

69
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Laughter),

70
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:51,000
don't seem to be doing all that well.

71
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

72
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Last November, a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum,

73
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:09,000
in a skyscraper, up on the 56th floor.

74
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And their inaugural exhibit was called "Happiness."

75
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And I went, very eagerly, to see it, because --

76
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:21,000
well, also, with an eye on this conference.

77
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas.

78
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Under "Arcadia," they showed things like this, from the Edo period --

79
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:4,000
a hundred ways to write "happiness" in different forms.

80
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Or they had this apple by Yoko Ono -- that, of course, later on

81
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:49,000
was, you know, made into the label for The Beatles.

82
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Under "Nirvana" they showed this Constable painting.

83
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstraction.

84
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:01,000
This is a blue field -- it's actually an Yves Klein painting.

85
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And the theory was that if you abstract an image, you really, you know

86
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:1,000
open as much room for the un-representable --

87
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and, therefore, you know, are able to involve the viewer more.

88
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Then, under "Desire," they showed these Shunsho paintings --

89
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:26,000
also from the Edo period -- ink on silk.

90
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And, lastly, under "Harmony," they had this 13th-century mandala from Tibet.

91
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Now, what I took away from the exhibit was that

92
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:4,000
maybe with the exception of the mandala

93
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:46,000
most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness

94
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and not about happiness.

95
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And I felt a little bit cheated, because the visualization --

96
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that's a really easy thing to do.

97
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And, you know, my studio -- we've done it all the time.

98
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:,000
This is, you know, a book.

99
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:04,000
A happy dog -- and you take it out, it's an aggressive dog.

100
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:1,000
It's a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne.

101
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face.

102
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:18,000
You know, that's not a big deal to accomplish.

103
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It has gotten to the point where, you know, within advertising

104
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:29,000
or within the movie industry, "happy" has gotten such a bad reputation that

105
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:32,000
if you actually want to do something with the subject

106
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and still appear authentic, you almost would have to, you know,

107
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:4,000
do it from a cynical point of view.

108
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:43,000
This is, you know, the movie poster.

109
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Or we, a couple of weeks ago, designed a box set for The Talking Heads

110
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:59,000
where the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has, very much, a dark side to it.

111
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Much, much more difficult is this, where the designs actually can evoke happiness --

112
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and I'm going to just show you three that actually did this for me.

113
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:21,000
This is a campaign done by a young artist in New York, who calls himself "True."

114
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Everybody who has ridden the New York subway system will be

115
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:27,000
familiar with these signs?

116
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:31,000
True printed his own version of these signs.

117
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Met every Wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends.

118
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:42,000
They divided up the different subway lines and added their own version.

119
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:43,000
(Laughter)

120
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So this is one.

121
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:51,000
(Laughter)

122
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Now, the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs.

123
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So you're

124
0:08:58,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Laughter)

125
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:04,000
you're really bored in the subway, and you kind of stare at something.

126
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And it takes you a while until it actually --

127
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:1,000
you realize that this says something different than what it normally says.

128
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Laughter)

129
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I mean, that's, at least, how it made me happy.

130
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:26,000
(Laughter)

131
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Now, True is a real humanitarian.

132
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:32,000
He didn't want any of his friends to be arrested,

133
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:37,000
so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card.

134
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Laughter)

135
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody --

136
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:47,000
sort of like pretending that it's an art project

137
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:49,000
financed by The Metropolitan Transit Authority.

138
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:51,000
(Laughter)

139
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Another New York project.

140
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:57,000
This is at P.S. 1 -- a sculpture that's basically a square room

141
0:09:57,000 --> 0:10:01,000
by James Turrell, that has a retractable ceiling.

142
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Opens up at dusk and dawn every day.

143
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:05,000
You don't see the horizon.

144
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:12,000
You're just in there, watching the incredible, subtle changes of color in the sky.

145
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And the room is truly something to be seen.

146
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:22,000
People's demeanor changes when they go in there.

147
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And, for sure, I haven't looked at the sky in the same way

148
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:3,000
after spending an hour in there.

149
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:35,000
There are, of course, more than those three projects that I'm showing here.

150
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz' "Cloud"

151
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:43,000
a couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy, as well.

152
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:48,000
But my last project is, again, from a young designer in New York.

153
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:49,000
He's from Korea originally.

154
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles --

155
0:10:57,000 --> 0:11:,000
empty speech bubbles stickers, large ones and small ones.

156
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And he goes around New York and just puts them, empty as they are, on posters.

157
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:07,000
(Laughter)

158
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And other people go and fill them in.

159
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:13,000
(Laughter)

160
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:16,000
This one says, "Please let me die in peace."

161
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
(Laughter)

162
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I think that was --

163
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:3,000
the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good.

164
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:33,000
This is on a musician poster, that says:

165
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
"I am concerned that my CD will not sell more than 200,000 units

166
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and that, as a result, my recoupable advance

167
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:43,000
from my label will be taken from me,

168
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:45,000
after which, my contract will be cancelled,

169
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and I'll be back doing Journey covers on Bleecker Street."

170
0:11:48,000 --> 0:12:07,000
(Laughter)

171
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins.

172
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Jee gets to have his project;

173
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:18,000
the public gets a sweeter environment;

174
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and different public gets a place to express itself;

175
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads.

176
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
(Laughter)

177
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Well, there was a question, of course, that was on my mind for a while:

178
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:44,000
You know, can I do more of the things that I like doing in design

179
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and less of the ones that I don't like to be doing?

180
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Which brought me back to my list making --

181
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:55,000
you know, just to see what I actually like about my job.

182
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:59,000
You know, one is: just working without pressure.

183
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Then: working concentrated, without being frazzled.

184
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Or, as Nancy said before, like really immerse oneself into it.

185
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Try not to get stuck doing the same thing --

186
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:16,000
or try not get stuck behind the computer all day.

187
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
This is, you know, related to it: getting out of the studio.

188
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Then, of course, trying to, you know, work on things

189
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:26,000
where the content is actually important for me.

190
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And being able to enjoy the end results.

191
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And then I found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained

192
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:44,000
all the things that I thought I learned in my life so far.

193
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And, just about at that time, an Austrian magazine called and asked

194
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:53,000
if we would want to do six spreads -- design six spreads

195
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:58,000
that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine?

196
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:,000
And the whole thing just fell together.

197
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:06,000
So I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned --

198
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:09,000
in this case, "Everything I do always comes back to me" --

199
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and we made these spreads right out of this.

200
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:14,000
So it was: "Everything

201
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:16,000
I do

202
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
always

203
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:19,000
comes

204
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:21,000
back

205
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:23,000
to me."

206
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:25,000
A couple of weeks ago, a

207
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:27,000
(Laughter)

208
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:32,000
French company asked us to design five billboards for them.

209
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Again, we could supply the content for it.

210
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:37,000
So I just picked another one.

211
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And this was two weeks ago.

212
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:45,000
We flew to Arizona -- the designer who works with me, and myself --

213
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and photographed this one.

214
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:5,000
So it's: "Trying

215
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:51,000
to look

216
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:53,000
good

217
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:55,000
limits

218
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:57,000
my life."

219
0:14:57,000 --> 0:15:,000
And then we did one more of these.

220
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:05,000
This is, again, for a magazine, dividing pages.

221
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:06,000
This is: "Having" --

222
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:07,000
this is the same thing;

223
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:1,000
it's just, you know, photographed from the side.

224
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:11,000
This is from the front.

225
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Then it's: "guts."

226
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Again, it's the same thing -- "guts" is just the same room, reworked.

227
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Then it's: "always

228
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:25,000
works out."

229
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Then it's "for," with the light on.

230
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:3,000
(Laughter)

231
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:32,000
And it's "me."

232
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Thank you so much.

233
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:38,000
(Applause)

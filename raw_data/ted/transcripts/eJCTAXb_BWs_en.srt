1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
For emotions, we should not move quickly to the desert.

2
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So, first, a small housekeeping announcement:

3
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
please switch off your

4
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
proper English check programs

5
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
installed in your brain.

6
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Applause)

7
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So, welcome to the Golden Desert, Indian desert.

8
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It receives the least rainfall in the country,

9
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
lowest rainfall.

10
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
If you are well-versed with inches, nine inches,

11
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
centimeters, 16 [centimeters].

12
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
The groundwater is 300 feet deep, 100 meters.

13
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And in most parts it is saline, not fit for drinking.

14
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So, you can't install hand pumps or dig wells,

15
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
though there is no electricity in most of the villages.

16
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But suppose you use the green technology, solar pumps --

17
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
they are of no use in this area.

18
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So, welcome to the Golden Desert.

19
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Clouds seldom visit this area.

20
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But we find 40 different names of clouds in this dialect used here.

21
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
There are a number of techniques to harvest rain.

22
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
This is a new work, it's a new program.

23
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But for the desert society

24
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
this is no program; this is their life.

25
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And they harvest rain in many ways.

26
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So, this is the first device they use

27
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
in harvesting rain.

28
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It's called kunds; somewhere it is called [unclear].

29
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And you can notice they have created

30
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
a kind of false catchment.

31
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
The desert is there, sand dunes, some small field.

32
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And this is all big raised platform.

33
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
You can notice the small holes

34
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the water will fall on this catchment,

35
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and there is a slope.

36
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Sometimes our engineers and architects

37
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
do not care about slopes in bathrooms,

38
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but here they will care properly.

39
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And the water will go where it should go.

40
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And then it is 40 feet deep.

41
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
The waterproofing is done perfectly,

42
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
better than our city contractors,

43
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
because not a single drop should go waste in this.

44
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
They collect 100 thousand liters in one season.

45
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And this is pure drinking water.

46
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
Below the surface there is hard saline water.

47
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But now you can have this for year round.

48
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
It's two houses.

49
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We often use a term called bylaws.

50
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Because we are used to get written things.

51
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But here it is unwritten by law.

52
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And people made their house,

53
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and the water storage tanks.

54
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
These raised up platforms just like this stage.

55
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
In fact they go 15 feet deep,

56
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and collect rain water from roof,

57
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
there is a small pipe, and from their courtyard.

58
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It can also harvest something like 25,000 in a good monsoon.

59
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Another big one,

60
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
this is of course out of the hardcore desert area.

61
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
This is near Jaipur. This is called the Jaigarh Fort.

62
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season.

63
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The age is 400 years.

64
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So, since 400 years it has been giving you

65
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
almost six million gallons of water per season.

66
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
You can calculate the price of that water.

67
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It draws water from 15 kilometers of canals.

68
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
You can see a modern road, hardly 50 years old.

69
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It can break sometimes.

70
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But this 400 year old canal, which draws water,

71
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
it is maintained for so many generations.

72
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Of course if you want to go inside, the two doors are locked.

73
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
But they can be opened for TED people.

74
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Laughter)

75
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And we request them.

76
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
You can see person coming up with

77
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
two canisters of water.

78
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And the water level -- these are not empty canisters --

79
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
water level is right up to this.

80
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
It can envy many municipalities,

81
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
the color, the taste, the purity of this water.

82
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And this is what they call Zero B type of water,

83
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
because it comes from the clouds,

84
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
pure distilled water.

85
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We stop for a quick commercial break,

86
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and then we come back to the traditional systems.

87
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The government thought that this is a very

88
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
backward area and we should bring

89
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
a multi-million dollar project

90
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
to bring water from the Himalayas.

91
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
That's why I said that this is a commercial break.

92
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But we will come back, once again,

94
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to the traditional thing.

95
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So, water from 300, 400 kilometers away,

96
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
soon it become like this.

97
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
In many portions, water hyacinth

98
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
covered these big canals like anything.

99
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Of course there are some areas where water is reaching,

100
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I'm not saying that it is not reaching at all.

101
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
But the tail end, the Jaisalmer area,

102
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
you will notice in Bikaner things like this:

103
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
where the water hyacinth couldn't grow,

104
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
the sand is flowing in these canals.

105
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it.

106
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Laughter)

107
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We had full-page advertisements,

108
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
some 30 years, 25 years ago when this canal came.

109
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
They said that throw away your traditional systems,

110
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
these new cement tanks will supply you piped water.

111
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It's a dream. And it became a dream also.

112
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Because soon the water was not able to reach these areas.

113
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And people started renovating their own structures.

114
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
These are all traditional water structures,

115
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
which we won't be able to explain in such a short time.

116
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But you can see that no woman is standing on those.

117
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
(Laughter)

118
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And they are plaiting hair.

119
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Applause)

120
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Jaisalmer. This is heart of desert.

121
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
This town was established 800 years ago.

122
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I'm not sure by that time

123
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Bombay was there, or Delhi was there,

124
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
or Chennai was there, or Bangalore was there.

125
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So, this was the terminal point for silk route.

126
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Well connected, 800 years ago, through Europe.

127
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
None of us were able to go to Europe,

128
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but Jaisalmer was well connected to it.

129
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And this is the 16 centimeter area.

130
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Such a limited rainfall,

131
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and highest colorful life flourished in these areas.

132
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
You won't find water in this slide.

133
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But it is invisible.

134
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Somewhere a stream or a rivulet

135
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
is running through here.

136
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Or, if you want to paint, you can paint it blue throughout

137
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
because every roof which you see in this picture

138
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
collects rainwater drops

139
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and deposit in the rooms.

140
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But apart from this system,

141
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
they designed 52 beautiful water bodies around this town.

142
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And what we call private public partnership

143
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
you can add estate also.

144
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So, estate, public and private entrepreneurs

145
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
work together to build this beautiful water body.

146
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And it's a kind of water body for all seasons.

147
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
You will admire it. Just behold the beauty throughout the year.

148
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Whether water level goes up or down,

149
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
the beauty is there throughout.

150
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Another water body, dried up, of course,

151
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
during the summer period,

152
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
but you can see how the traditional society

153
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
combines engineering with aesthetics, with the heart.

154
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
These statues, marvelous statues,

155
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
gives you an idea of water table.

156
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
When this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank,

157
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
it will submerge these beautiful statues

158
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
in what we call in English today "mass communication."

159
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
This was for mass communication.

160
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned,

161
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
so water will be there for seven months or nine months,

162
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
or 12 months.

163
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And then they will come and worship this pond,

164
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
pay respect, their gratitude.

165
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Another small water body, called the [unclear].

166
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It is difficult to translate in English,

167
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
especially in my English.

168
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
But the nearest would be "glory," a reputation.

169
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
The reputation in desert of this small water body is

170
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
that it never dries up.

171
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
In severe drought periods

172
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
nobody has seen this water body

173
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
getting dried up.

174
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And perhaps they knew the future also.

175
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It was designed some 150 years ago.

176
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
But perhaps they knew that on sixth, November, 2009,

177
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
there will be a TED green and blue session,

178
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
so they painted it like this.

179
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
(Laughter)

180
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Applause)

181
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Dry water body. Children are standing on

182
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
a very difficult device to explain.

183
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
This is called kund. We have, in English, surface water and ground water.

184
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
But this is not ground water.

185
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
You can draw ground water from any well.

186
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
But this is no ordinary well.

187
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
It squeeze the moisture

188
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
hidden in the sand.

189
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And they have dubbed this water as the third one called [unclear].

190
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And there is a gypsum belt running below it.

191
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And it was deposited by the great mother Earth,

192
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
some three million years ago.

193
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And where we have this gypsum strip

194
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
they can harvest this water.

195
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
This is the same dry water body.

196
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Now, you don't find any kund;

197
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
they are all submerged.

198
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
But when the water goes down they will be able

199
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
to draw water from those structures throughout the year.

200
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
This year they have received only six centimeters.

201
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Six centimeter of rainfall,

202
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and they can telephone you

203
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that if you find any water problem in your city,

204
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore,

205
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
please come to our area of six centimeters, we can give you water.

206
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
(Laughter)

207
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
How they maintain them?

208
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
There are three things: concept, planning,

209
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
making the actual thing, and also maintaining them.

210
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
It is a structure for maintain,

211
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
for centuries, by generations, without any department,

212
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
without any funding,

213
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So the secret is "[unclear]," respect.

214
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Your own thing, not personal property,

215
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
my property, every time.

216
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So, these stone pillars

217
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
will remind you that you are entering into a water body area.

218
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Don't spit, don't do anything wrong,

219
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
so that the clean water can be collected.

220
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Another pillar, stone pillar on your right side.

221
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
If you climb these three, six steps

222
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
you will find something very nice.

223
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
This was done in 11th century.

224
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And you have to go further down.

225
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
They say that a picture is worth a thousand words,

226
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
so we can say a thousand words right now,

227
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
an another thousand words.

228
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
If the water table goes down,

229
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
you will find new stairs.

230
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
If it comes up, some of them will be submerged.

231
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
So, throughout the year

232
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
this beautiful system will give you some pleasure.

233
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Three sides, such steps, on the fourth side

234
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
there is a four-story building

235
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
where you can organize such TED conferences anytime.

236
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
(Applause)

237
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Excuse me, who built these structures?

238
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
They are in front of you.

239
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
The best civil engineers we had, the best planners,

240
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
the best architects.

241
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
We can say that because of them,

242
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
because of their forefathers,

243
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
India could get the first engineering college

244
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
in 1847.

245
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
There were no English medium schools at that time,

246
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
even no Hindi schools, [unclear] schools.

247
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
But such people, compelled to the East India Company,

248
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
which came here for business, a very dirty kind of business ...

249
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
(Laughter)

250
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
but not to create the engineering colleges.

251
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
But because of them, first engineering college was created

252
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
in a small village, not in the town.

253
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
The last point, we all know in our primary schools that

254
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that camel is a ship of desert.

255
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
So, you can find through your Jeep,

256
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
a camel, and a cart.

257
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
This tire comes from the airplane.

258
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
So, look at the beauty from the desert society

259
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
who can harvest rainwater,

260
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and also create something

261
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
through a tire from a jet plane,

262
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and used in a camel cart.

263
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Last picture, it's a tattoo,

264
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
2,000-years-old tattoo.

265
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
They were using it on their body.

266
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Tattoo was, at one time,

267
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
a kind of a blacklisted

268
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
or con thing, but now it is in thing.

269
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
(Laughter)

270
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
(Applause)

271
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
You can copy this tattoo. I have some posters of this.

272
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
(Laughter)

273
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
The center of life is water.

274
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
These are the beautiful waves.

275
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
These are the beautiful stairs

276
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
which we just saw in one of the slides.

277
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
These are the trees.

278
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And these are the flowers which

279
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
add fragrance to our lives.

280
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
So, this is the message of desert.

281
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Thank you very much.

282
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
(Applause)

283
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Chris Anderson: So, first of all, I wish I had your eloquence, truly, in any language.

284
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
(Applause)

285
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
These artifacts and designs are inspiring.

286
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Do you believe that they can be used elsewhere,

287
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
that the world can learn from this?

288
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Or is this just right for this place?

289
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Anupam Mishra: No, the basic idea is to

290
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
utilize water that falls on our area.

291
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
So, the ponds, the open bodies, are everywhere,

292
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
right from Sri Lanka to Kashmir, and in other parts also.

293
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
And these [unclear], which stored water,

294
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
there are two type of things.

295
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
One recharge, and one stores.

296
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
So, it depends on the terrain.

297
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
But kund, which uses the gypsum belt,

298
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
for that you have to go back to your calendar,

299
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
three million years ago.

300
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
If it is there it can be done right now.

301
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Otherwise, it can't be done.

302
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
(Laughter)

303
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
(Applause)

304
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
CA: Thank you so much.

305
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
(Applause)

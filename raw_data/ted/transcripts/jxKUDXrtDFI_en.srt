1
0:00:13.167,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Thank you.

2
0:00:14.474,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I have only got 18 minutes

3
0:00:15.983,000 --> 0:00:17,000
to explain something that lasts for hours and days,

4
0:00:18.832,000 --> 0:00:2,000
so I'd better get started.

5
0:00:21.102,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Let's start with a clip from Al Jazeera's Listening Post.

6
0:00:26.649,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Richard Gizbert: Norway is a country that gets relatively little media coverage.

7
0:00:30.496,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Even the elections this past week passed without much drama.

8
0:00:33.487,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And that's the Norwegian media in a nutshell:

9
0:00:36.145,000 --> 0:00:37,000
not much drama.

10
0:00:37.622,000 --> 0:00:38,000
A few years back,

11
0:00:38.959,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Norway's public TV channel NRK

12
0:00:41.416,000 --> 0:00:45,000
decided to broadcast live coverage of a seven-hour train ride --

13
0:00:45.593,000 --> 0:00:47,000
seven hours of simple footage,

14
0:00:47.894,000 --> 0:00:49,000
a train rolling down the tracks.

15
0:00:50.123,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Norwegians, more than a million of them according to the ratings, loved it.

16
0:00:53.985,000 --> 0:00:55,000
A new kind of reality TV show was born,

17
0:00:56.901,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and it goes against all the rules of TV engagement.

18
0:01:00.036,000 --> 0:01:02,000
There is no story line, no script,

19
0:01:02.476,000 --> 0:01:04,000
no drama, no climax,

20
0:01:04.519,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and it's called Slow TV.

21
0:01:06.443,000 --> 0:01:07,000
For the past two months,

22
0:01:07.915,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Norwegians have been watching a cruise ship's journey up the coast,

23
0:01:11.507,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and there's a lot of fog on that coast.

24
0:01:13.566,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Executives at Norway's National Broadcasting Service

25
0:01:16.639,000 --> 0:01:2,000
are now considering broadcasting a night of knitting nationwide.

26
0:01:20.729,000 --> 0:01:22,000
On the surface, it sounds boring,

27
0:01:23.21,000 --> 0:01:24,000
because it is,

28
0:01:24.51,000 --> 0:01:26,000
but something about this TV experiment

29
0:01:26.6,000 --> 0:01:27,000
has gripped Norwegians.

30
0:01:28.458,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So we sent the Listening Post's Marcela Pizarro to Oslo

31
0:01:31.615,000 --> 0:01:33,000
to find out what it is, but first a warning:

32
0:01:34.146,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Viewers may find some of the images in the following report disappointing.

33
0:01:38.649,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:40.034,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Thomas Hellum: And then follows an eight-minute story on Al Jazeera

35
0:01:43.55,000 --> 0:01:46,000
about some strange TV programs in little Norway.

36
0:01:46.876,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Al Jazeera. CNN. How did we get there?

37
0:01:49.934,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We have to go back to 2009,

38
0:01:51.954,000 --> 0:01:52,000
when one of my colleagues got a great idea.

39
0:01:53.953,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Where do you get your ideas?

40
0:01:55.756,000 --> 0:01:56,000
In the lunchroom.

41
0:01:57.737,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So he said, why don't we make a radio program

42
0:02:00.714,000 --> 0:02:03,000
marking the day of the German invasion of Norway in 1940.

43
0:02:04.299,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We tell the story at the exact time during the night.

44
0:02:08.343,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Wow. Brilliant idea, except

45
0:02:10.507,000 --> 0:02:12,000
this was just a couple of weeks before the invasion day.

46
0:02:13.41,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So we sat in our lunchroom and discussed

47
0:02:15.755,000 --> 0:02:19,000
what other stories can you tell as they evolve?

48
0:02:19.963,000 --> 0:02:23,000
What other things take a really long time?

49
0:02:24.421,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So one of us came up with a train.

50
0:02:26.737,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The Bergen Railway had its 100-year anniversary that year

51
0:02:30.729,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It goes from western Norway to eastern Norway,

52
0:02:33.424,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and it takes exactly the same time as it did 40 years ago,

53
0:02:37.587,000 --> 0:02:4,000
over seven hours. (Laughter)

54
0:02:40.785,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So we caught our commissioning editors in Oslo, and we said,

55
0:02:43.771,000 --> 0:02:45,000
we want to make a documentary about the Bergen Railway,

56
0:02:46.758,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and we want to make it in full length,

57
0:02:48.71,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and the answer was,

58
0:02:50.064,000 --> 0:02:51,000
"Yes, but how long will the program be?"

59
0:02:51.999,000 --> 0:02:52,000
"Oh," we said, "full length."

60
0:02:53.857,000 --> 0:02:54,000
"Yes, but we mean the program."

61
0:02:55.349,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And back and forth.

62
0:02:57.456,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Luckily for us, they met us with laughter, very, very good laughter,

63
0:03:02.943,000 --> 0:03:04,000
so one bright day in September,

64
0:03:05.629,000 --> 0:03:08,000
we started a program that we thought should be seven hours and four minutes.

65
0:03:09.615,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Actually, it turned out to be seven hours and 14 minutes

66
0:03:12.479,000 --> 0:03:16,000
due to a signal failure at the last station.

67
0:03:16.983,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We had four cameras,

68
0:03:18.957,000 --> 0:03:21,000
three of them pointing out to the beautiful nature.

69
0:03:22.263,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Some talking to the guests, some information.

70
0:03:26.233,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Video) Train announcement: We will arrive at Haugastøl Station.

71
0:03:30.283,000 --> 0:03:31,000
TH: And that's about it,

72
0:03:31.651,000 --> 0:03:32,000
but of course, also

73
0:03:33.446,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the 160 tunnels gave us the opportunity to do some archives.

74
0:03:37.287,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Narrator [in Norwegian]: Then a bit of flirting while the food is digested.

75
0:03:42.483,000 --> 0:03:46,000
The last downhill stretch before we reach our destination.

76
0:03:47.901,000 --> 0:03:5,000
We pass Mjølfjell Station.

77
0:03:52.207,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Then a new tunnel.

78
0:03:54.615,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

79
0:03:55.765,000 --> 0:03:58,000
TH: And now we thought, yes, we have a brilliant program.

80
0:03:59.022,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It will fit for the 2,000 train spotters in Norway.

81
0:04:03.619,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We brought it on air in November 2009.

82
0:04:06.22,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But no, this was far more attractive.

83
0:04:08.667,000 --> 0:04:11,000
This is the five biggest TV channels in Norway on a normal Friday,

84
0:04:12.489,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and if you look at NRK2 over here,

85
0:04:14.788,000 --> 0:04:17,000
look what happened when they put on the Bergen Railway show:

86
0:04:18.984,000 --> 0:04:21,000
1.2 million Norwegians watched part of this program.

87
0:04:22.709,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Applause)

88
0:04:26.624,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And another funny thing:

89
0:04:28.81,000 --> 0:04:29,000
When the host on our main channel,

90
0:04:30.757,000 --> 0:04:32,000
after they have got news for you,

91
0:04:33.224,000 --> 0:04:35,000
she said, "And on our second channel,

92
0:04:35.662,000 --> 0:04:37,000
the train has now nearly reached Myrdal station."

93
0:04:38.657,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Thousands of people just jumped on the train

94
0:04:41.35,000 --> 0:04:45,000
on our second channel like this. (Laughter)

95
0:04:45.366,000 --> 0:04:48,000
This was also a huge success in terms of social media.

96
0:04:49.012,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It was so nice to see all the thousands of Facebook and Twitter users

97
0:04:53.116,000 --> 0:04:55,000
discussing the same view,

98
0:04:55.977,000 --> 0:04:59,000
talking to each other as if they were on the same train together.

99
0:05:00.463,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And especially, I like this one. It's a 76-year-old man.

100
0:05:03.748,000 --> 0:05:04,000
He's watched all the program,

101
0:05:05.428,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and at the end station, he rises up to pick up what he thinks is his luggage,

102
0:05:09.445,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and his head hit the curtain rod,

103
0:05:13.003,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and he realized he is in his own living room.

104
0:05:15.691,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Applause)

105
0:05:21.426,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So that's strong and living TV.

106
0:05:26.07,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Four hundred and thirty-six minute by minute on a Friday night,

107
0:05:29.414,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and during that first night,

108
0:05:31.275,000 --> 0:05:33,000
the first Twitter message came: Why be a chicken?

109
0:05:33.829,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Why stop at 436 when you can expand that

110
0:05:39.498,000 --> 0:05:42,000
to 8,040, minute by minute,

111
0:05:43.159,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and do the iconic journey in Norway,

112
0:05:45.365,000 --> 0:05:48,000
the coastal ship journey Hurtigruten from Bergen to Kirkenes,

113
0:05:48.807,000 --> 0:05:51,000
almost 3,000 kilometers, covering most of our coast.

114
0:05:52.361,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It has 120-year-old, very interesting history,

115
0:05:56.939,000 --> 0:06:,000
and literally takes part in life and death along the coast.

116
0:06:01.755,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So just a week after the Bergen Railway,

117
0:06:04.126,000 --> 0:06:08,000
we called the Hurtigruten company and we started planning for our next show.

118
0:06:10.082,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We wanted to do something different.

119
0:06:12.245,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The Bergen Railway was a recorded program.

120
0:06:15.526,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So when we sat in our editing room,

121
0:06:17.616,000 --> 0:06:19,000
we watched this picture -- it's all Ål Station --

122
0:06:20.22,000 --> 0:06:21,000
we saw this journalist.

123
0:06:21.728,000 --> 0:06:22,000
We had called him, we had spoken to him,

124
0:06:23.681,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and when we left the station,

125
0:06:25.537,000 --> 0:06:28,000
he took this picture of us and he waved to the camera,

126
0:06:28.728,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and we thought,

127
0:06:30.188,000 --> 0:06:33,000
what if more people knew that we were on board that train?

128
0:06:33.44,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Would more people show up?

129
0:06:35.286,000 --> 0:06:36,000
What would it look like?

130
0:06:37.259,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So we decided our next project, it should be live.

131
0:06:40.789,000 --> 0:06:44,000
We wanted this picture of us on the fjord and on the screen at the same time.

132
0:06:47.034,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So this is not the first time NRK had been on board a ship.

133
0:06:50.355,000 --> 0:06:51,000
This is back in 1964,

134
0:06:52.073,000 --> 0:06:54,000
when the technical managers have suits and ties

135
0:06:54.929,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and NRK rolled all its equipment on board a ship,

136
0:06:58.969,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and 200 meters out of the shore, transmitting the signal back,

137
0:07:03.009,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and in the machine room, they talked to the machine guy,

138
0:07:06.957,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and on the deck, they have splendid entertainment.

139
0:07:11.11,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So being on a ship, it's not the first time.

140
0:07:17.309,000 --> 0:07:22,000
But five and a half days in a row, and live, we wanted some help.

141
0:07:22.335,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And we asked our viewers out there, what do you want to see?

142
0:07:26.498,000 --> 0:07:3,000
What do you want us to film? How do you want this to look?

143
0:07:30.61,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Do you want us to make a website? What do you want on it?

144
0:07:33.318,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And we got some answers from you out there,

145
0:07:35.556,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and it helped us a very lot to build the program.

146
0:07:39.807,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So in June 2011,

147
0:07:42.662,000 --> 0:07:45,000
23 of us went on board the Hurtigruten coastal ship

148
0:07:46.446,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and we set off.

149
0:07:48.164,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Music)

150
0:08:47.373,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I have some really strong memories from that week, and it's all about people.

151
0:08:51.092,000 --> 0:08:52,000
This guy, for instance,

152
0:08:52.732,000 --> 0:08:54,000
he's head of research at the University in Tromsø

153
0:08:55.425,000 --> 0:08:56,000
(Laughter)

154
0:08:57.188,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And I will show you a piece of cloth,

155
0:09:02.071,000 --> 0:09:05,000
this one.

156
0:09:06.378,000 --> 0:09:07,000
It's the other strong memory.

157
0:09:07.922,000 --> 0:09:1,000
It belongs to a guy called Erik Hansen.

158
0:09:12.796,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And it's people like those two who took a firm grip of our program,

159
0:09:20.818,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and together with thousands of others along the route,

160
0:09:24.639,000 --> 0:09:26,000
they made the program what it became.

161
0:09:27.519,000 --> 0:09:29,000
They made all the stories.

162
0:09:30.047,000 --> 0:09:33,000
This is Karl. He's in the ninth grade.

163
0:09:33.091,000 --> 0:09:36,000
It says, "I will be a little late for school tomorrow."

164
0:09:36.713,000 --> 0:09:38,000
He was supposed to be in the school at 8 a.m.

165
0:09:39.383,000 --> 0:09:42,000
He came at 9 a.m., and he didn't get a note from his teacher,

166
0:09:42.484,000 --> 0:09:44,000
because the teacher had watched the program.

167
0:09:44.585,000 --> 0:09:45,000
(Laughter)

168
0:09:46.046,000 --> 0:09:47,000
How did we do this?

169
0:09:47.719,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Yes, we took a conference room on board the Hurtigruten.

170
0:09:50.935,000 --> 0:09:53,000
We turned it into a complete TV control room.

171
0:09:54.047,000 --> 0:09:57,000
We made it all work, of course,

172
0:09:57.1,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and then we took along 11 cameras.

173
0:09:59.259,000 --> 0:10:,000
This is one of them.

174
0:10:00.374,000 --> 0:10:01,000
This is my sketch from February,

175
0:10:02.347,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and when you give this sketch to professional people

176
0:10:04.855,000 --> 0:10:06,000
in the Norwegian broadcasting company NRK,

177
0:10:07.084,000 --> 0:10:09,000
you get some cool stuff back.

178
0:10:10.024,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And with some very creative solutions.

179
0:10:14.201,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Video) Narrator [in Norwegian]: Run it up and down.

180
0:10:16.719,000 --> 0:10:19,000
This is Norway's most important drill right now.

181
0:10:20.141,000 --> 0:10:25,000
It regulates the height of a bow camera in NRK's live production,

182
0:10:26.054,000 --> 0:10:3,000
one of 11 that capture great shots from the MS Nord-Norge.

183
0:10:30.79,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Eight wires keep the camera stable.

184
0:10:33.461,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Cameraman: I work on different camera solutions.

185
0:10:37.106,000 --> 0:10:4,000
They're just tools used in a different context.

186
0:10:40.96,000 --> 0:10:43,000
TH: Another camera is this one. It's normally used for sports.

187
0:10:44.304,000 --> 0:10:47,000
It made it possible for us to take close-up pictures of people

188
0:10:47.903,000 --> 0:10:49,000
100 kilomteres away,

189
0:10:49.923,000 --> 0:10:53,000
like this one. (Laughter)

190
0:10:54.358,000 --> 0:10:56,000
People called us and asked, how is this man doing?

191
0:10:57.19,000 --> 0:10:59,000
He's doing fine. Everything went well.

192
0:11:00.139,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We also could take pictures of people waving at us,

193
0:11:03.372,000 --> 0:11:05,000
people along the route, thousands of them,

194
0:11:05.689,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and they all had a phone in their hand.

195
0:11:08.114,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And when you take a picture of them, and they get the message,

196
0:11:11.099,000 --> 0:11:13,000
"Now we are on TV, dad," they start waving back.

197
0:11:13.954,000 --> 0:11:15,000
This was waving TV for five and a half days,

198
0:11:16.114,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and people get so extremely happy

199
0:11:18.273,000 --> 0:11:22,000
when they can send a warm message to their loved ones.

200
0:11:23.09,000 --> 0:11:26,000
It was also a great success on social media.

201
0:11:26.609,000 --> 0:11:28,000
On the last day, we met Her Majesty the Queen of Norway,

202
0:11:29.418,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and Twitter couldn't quite handle it.

203
0:11:33.017,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And we also, on the web,

204
0:11:35.386,000 --> 0:11:39,000
during this week we streamed more than 100 years of video

205
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to 148 nations,

206
0:11:43.628,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and the websites are still there and they will be forever, actually,

207
0:11:47.829,000 --> 0:11:48,000
because Hurtigruten was selected

208
0:11:49.735,000 --> 0:11:53,000
to be part of the Norwegian UNESCO list of documents,

209
0:11:54.267,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and it's also in the Guinness Book of Records

210
0:11:57.258,000 --> 0:12:,000
as the longest documentary ever.

211
0:12:00.764,000 --> 0:12:03,000
(Applause)

212
0:12:04.247,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Thank you.

213
0:12:07.985,000 --> 0:12:1,000
But it's a long program,

214
0:12:11.375,000 --> 0:12:14,000
so some watched part of it, like the Prime Minister.

215
0:12:14.463,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Some watched a little bit more.

216
0:12:16.205,000 --> 0:12:2,000
It says, "I haven't used my bed for five days."

217
0:12:20.614,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And he's 82 years old, and he hardly slept.

218
0:12:25.085,000 --> 0:12:28,000
He kept watching because something might happen,

219
0:12:28.441,000 --> 0:12:3,000
though it probably won't. (Laughter)

220
0:12:30.854,000 --> 0:12:32,000
This is the number of viewers along the route.

221
0:12:33.503,000 --> 0:12:34,000
You can see the famous Trollfjord

222
0:12:35.105,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and a day after, all-time high for NRK2.

223
0:12:39.849,000 --> 0:12:44,000
If you see the four biggest channels in Norway during June 2011,

224
0:12:45.671,000 --> 0:12:47,000
they will look like this,

225
0:12:47.968,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and as a TV producer, it's a pleasure to put Hurtigruten on top of it.

226
0:12:51.818,000 --> 0:12:52,000
It looks like this:

227
0:12:53.541,000 --> 0:12:56,000
3.2 million Norwegians watched part of this program,

228
0:12:56.908,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and we are only five million here.

229
0:12:58.788,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Even the passengers on board the Hurtigruten coastal ship --

230
0:13:01.822,000 --> 0:13:02,000
(Laughter) --

231
0:13:03.436,000 --> 0:13:07,000
they chose to watched the telly instead of turning 90 degrees

232
0:13:07.561,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and watching out the window.

233
0:13:10.435,000 --> 0:13:12,000
So we were allowed to be part of people's living room

234
0:13:13.416,000 --> 0:13:15,000
with this strange TV program,

235
0:13:16.173,000 --> 0:13:19,000
with music, nature, people.

236
0:13:19.546,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And Slow TV was now a buzzword,

237
0:13:22.239,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and we started looking for other things we could make Slow TV about.

238
0:13:26.073,000 --> 0:13:29,000
So we could either take something long and make it a topic,

239
0:13:29.515,000 --> 0:13:31,000
like with the railway and the Hurtigruten,

240
0:13:31.736,000 --> 0:13:33,000
or we could take a topic and make it long.

241
0:13:34.267,000 --> 0:13:36,000
This is the last project. It's the peep show.

242
0:13:36.775,000 --> 0:13:38,000
It's 14 hours of birdwatching on a TV screen,

243
0:13:39.561,000 --> 0:13:42,000
actually 87 days on the web.

244
0:13:42.742,000 --> 0:13:45,000
We have made 18 hours of live salmon fishing.

245
0:13:46.364,000 --> 0:13:49,000
It actually took three hours before we got the first fish,

246
0:13:49.429,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and that's quite slow.

247
0:13:51.24,000 --> 0:13:56,000
We have made 12 hours of boat ride into the beautiful Telemark Canal,

248
0:13:56.276,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and we have made another train ride with the northern railway,

249
0:13:59.821,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and because this we couldn't do live, we did it in four seasons

250
0:14:03.823,000 --> 0:14:07,000
just to give the viewer another experience on the way.

251
0:14:09.058,000 --> 0:14:13,000
So our next project got us some attention outside Norway.

252
0:14:13.598,000 --> 0:14:15,000
This is from the Colbert Report on Comedy Central.

253
0:14:16.484,000 --> 0:14:19,000
(Video) Stephen Colbert: I've got my eye on a wildly popular program from Norway

254
0:14:20.28,000 --> 0:14:22,000
called "National Firewood Night,"

255
0:14:23.213,000 --> 0:14:27,000
which consisted of mostly people in parkas chatting and chopping in the woods,

256
0:14:27.485,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and then eight hours of a fire burning in a fireplace. (Laughter)

257
0:14:31.13,000 --> 0:14:33,000
It destroyed the other top Norwegian shows,

258
0:14:33.731,000 --> 0:14:35,000
like "So You Think You Can Watch Paint Dry"

259
0:14:36.146,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and "The Amazing Glacier Race."

260
0:14:39.977,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And get this, almost 20 percent of the Norwegian population tuned in,

261
0:14:45.182,000 --> 0:14:46,000
20 percent.

262
0:14:46.85,000 --> 0:14:49,000
TH: So, when wood fire and wood chopping can be that interesting,

263
0:14:50.727,000 --> 0:14:51,000
why not knitting?

264
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
So on our next project,

265
0:14:53.978,000 --> 0:14:58,000
we used more than eight hours to go live from a sheep to a sweater,

266
0:14:58.995,000 --> 0:15:,000
and Jimmy Kimmel in the ABC show,

267
0:15:01.302,000 --> 0:15:03,000
he liked that.

268
0:15:03.451,000 --> 0:15:09,000
(Music)

269
0:15:10.324,000 --> 0:15:13,000
(Video) Jimmy Kimmel: Even the people on the show are falling asleep,

270
0:15:14.044,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and after all that, the knitters actually failed

271
0:15:16.32,000 --> 0:15:17,000
to break the world record.

272
0:15:17.996,000 --> 0:15:18,000
They did not succeed,

273
0:15:19.342,000 --> 0:15:21,000
but remember the old Norwegian saying,

274
0:15:21.585,000 --> 0:15:23,000
it's not whether you win or lose that counts.

275
0:15:23.763,000 --> 0:15:25,000
In fact, nothing counts, and death is coming for us all.

276
0:15:26.487,000 --> 0:15:27,000
(Laughter)

277
0:15:27.931,000 --> 0:15:29,000
TH: Exactly. So why does this stand out?

278
0:15:30.825,000 --> 0:15:33,000
This is so completely different to other TV programming.

279
0:15:34.105,000 --> 0:15:38,000
We take the viewer on a journey that happens right now in real time,

280
0:15:38.847,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and the viewer gets the feeling of actually being there,

281
0:15:42.424,000 --> 0:15:44,000
actually being on the train, on the boat,

282
0:15:44.588,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and knitting together with others,

283
0:15:46.415,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and the reason I think why they're doing that

284
0:15:48.872,000 --> 0:15:5,000
is because we don't edit the timeline.

285
0:15:51.352,000 --> 0:15:53,000
It's important that we don't edit the timeline,

286
0:15:53.72,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and it's also important that what we make Slow TV about

287
0:15:56.919,000 --> 0:16:,000
is something that we all can relate to, that the viewer can relate to,

288
0:16:01.648,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and that somehow has a root in our culture.

289
0:16:04.765,000 --> 0:16:05,000
This is a picture from last summer

290
0:16:06.491,000 --> 0:16:08,000
when we traveled the coast again for seven weeks.

291
0:16:09.068,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And of course this is a lot of planning, this is a lot of logistics.

292
0:16:13.431,000 --> 0:16:17,000
So this is the working plan for 150 people last summer,

293
0:16:17.543,000 --> 0:16:19,000
but more important is what you don't plan.

294
0:16:20.388,000 --> 0:16:22,000
You don't plan what's going to happen.

295
0:16:22.905,000 --> 0:16:24,000
You have to just take your cameras with you.

296
0:16:25.891,000 --> 0:16:26,000
It's like a sports event.

297
0:16:27.411,000 --> 0:16:29,000
You rig them and you see what's happening.

298
0:16:29.57,000 --> 0:16:31,000
So this is actually the whole running order

299
0:16:32.054,000 --> 0:16:36,000
for Hurtigruten, 134 hours, just written on one page.

300
0:16:36.501,000 --> 0:16:4,000
We didn't know anything more when we left Bergen.

301
0:16:40.553,000 --> 0:16:43,000
So you have to let the viewers make the stories themselves,

302
0:16:43.897,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and I'll give you an example of that.

303
0:16:46.126,000 --> 0:16:47,000
This is from last summer,

304
0:16:47.89,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and as a TV producer,

305
0:16:49.748,000 --> 0:16:52,000
it's a nice picture, but now you can cut to the next one.

306
0:16:53.395,000 --> 0:16:54,000
But this is Slow TV,

307
0:16:55.135,000 --> 0:16:58,000
so you have to keep this picture until it really starts hurting your stomach,

308
0:16:58.809,000 --> 0:17:,000
and then you keep it a little bit longer,

309
0:17:01.169,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and when you keep it that long,

310
0:17:02.689,000 --> 0:17:04,000
I'm sure some of you now have noticed the cow.

311
0:17:05.453,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Some of you have seen the flag.

312
0:17:07.487,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Some of you start wondering, is the farmer at home?

313
0:17:09.893,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Has he left? Is he watching the cow?

314
0:17:12.34,000 --> 0:17:15,000
And where is that cow going?

315
0:17:15.567,000 --> 0:17:18,000
So my point is, the longer you keep a picture like this,

316
0:17:18.801,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and we kept it for 10 minutes,

317
0:17:21.093,000 --> 0:17:24,000
you start making the stories in your own head.

318
0:17:25.064,000 --> 0:17:29,000
That's Slow TV.

319
0:17:29.267,000 --> 0:17:34,000
So we think that Slow TV is one nice way of telling a TV story,

320
0:17:34.677,000 --> 0:17:36,000
and we think that we can continue doing it,

321
0:17:37.161,000 --> 0:17:41,000
not too often, once or twice a year, so we keep the feeling of an event,

322
0:17:41.665,000 --> 0:17:43,000
and we also think that the good Slow TV idea,

323
0:17:44.568,000 --> 0:17:45,000
that's the idea when people say,

324
0:17:46.24,000 --> 0:17:49,000
"Oh no, you can't put that on TV."

325
0:17:49.676,000 --> 0:17:52,000
When people smile, it might be a very good slow idea,

326
0:17:52.718,000 --> 0:17:56,000
so after all, life is best when it's a bit strange.

327
0:17:56.97,000 --> 0:17:57,000
Thank you.

328
0:17:58.463,000 --> 0:18:04,000
(Applause)

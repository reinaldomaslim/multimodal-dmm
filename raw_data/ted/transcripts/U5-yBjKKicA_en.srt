1
0:00:12.78,000 --> 0:00:18,000
A few days after my husband Paul was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer,

2
0:00:19.18,000 --> 0:00:21,000
we were lying in our bed at home,

3
0:00:21.7,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and Paul said,

4
0:00:23.5,000 --> 0:00:24,000
"It's going to be OK."

5
0:00:25.86,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And I remember answering back,

6
0:00:28.38,000 --> 0:00:29,000
"Yes.

7
0:00:29.62,000 --> 0:00:32,000
We just don't know what OK means yet."

8
0:00:35.14,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Paul and I had met as first-year medical students at Yale.

9
0:00:38.66,000 --> 0:00:41,000
He was smart and kind and super funny.

10
0:00:42.7,000 --> 0:00:45,000
He used to keep a gorilla suit in the trunk of his car,

11
0:00:46.54,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and he'd say, "It's for emergencies only."

12
0:00:48.98,000 --> 0:00:49,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:51.02,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I fell in love with Paul as I watched the care he took with his patients.

14
0:00:55.22,000 --> 0:00:57,000
He stayed late talking with them,

15
0:00:57.42,000 --> 0:01:,000
seeking to understand the experience of illness

16
0:01:00.9,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and not just its technicalities.

17
0:01:04.38,000 --> 0:01:06,000
He later told me he fell in love with me

18
0:01:06.62,000 --> 0:01:11,000
when he saw me cry over an EKG of a heart that had ceased beating.

19
0:01:12.94,000 --> 0:01:13,000
We didn't know it yet,

20
0:01:14.5,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but even in the heady days of young love,

21
0:01:17.66,000 --> 0:01:2,000
we were learning how to approach suffering together.

22
0:01:22.66,000 --> 0:01:24,000
We got married and became doctors.

23
0:01:25.06,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I was working as an internist

24
0:01:27.1,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and Paul was finishing his training as a neurosurgeon

25
0:01:31.18,000 --> 0:01:32,000
when he started to lose weight.

26
0:01:34.3,000 --> 0:01:38,000
He developed excruciating back pain and a cough that wouldn't go away.

27
0:01:40.22,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And when he was admitted to the hospital,

28
0:01:42.38,000 --> 0:01:46,000
a CT scan revealed tumors in Paul's lungs and in his bones.

29
0:01:48.46,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We had both cared for patients with devastating diagnoses;

30
0:01:53.02,000 --> 0:01:55,000
now it was our turn.

31
0:01:58.54,000 --> 0:02:,000
We lived with Paul's illness for 22 months.

32
0:02:01.74,000 --> 0:02:03,000
He wrote a memoir about facing mortality.

33
0:02:05.14,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I gave birth to our daughter Cady,

34
0:02:08.06,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and we loved her and each other.

35
0:02:10.54,000 --> 0:02:14,000
We learned directly how to struggle through really tough medical decisions.

36
0:02:17.14,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The day we took Paul into the hospital for the last time

37
0:02:20.739,000 --> 0:02:22,000
was the most difficult day of my life.

38
0:02:24.38,000 --> 0:02:25,000
When he turned to me at the end

39
0:02:26.38,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and said, "I'm ready,"

40
0:02:30.82,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I knew that wasn't just a brave decision.

41
0:02:34.1,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It was the right one.

42
0:02:36.5,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Paul didn't want a ventilator and CPR.

43
0:02:40.18,000 --> 0:02:41,000
In that moment,

44
0:02:41.7,000 --> 0:02:43,000
the most important thing to Paul

45
0:02:45.38,000 --> 0:02:46,000
was to hold our baby daughter.

46
0:02:49.06,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Nine hours later,

47
0:02:50.9,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Paul died.

48
0:02:55.78,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I've always thought of myself as a caregiver --

49
0:02:58.06,000 --> 0:03:,000
most physicians do --

50
0:03:00.14,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and taking care of Paul deepened what that meant.

51
0:03:03.94,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Watching him reshape his identity during his illness,

52
0:03:07.58,000 --> 0:03:1,000
learning to witness and accept his pain,

53
0:03:11.1,000 --> 0:03:13,000
talking together through his choices --

54
0:03:13.66,000 --> 0:03:14,000
those experiences taught me

55
0:03:15.1,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that resilience does not mean bouncing back to where you were before,

56
0:03:20.38,000 --> 0:03:22,000
or pretending that the hard stuff isn't hard.

57
0:03:23.94,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It is so hard.

58
0:03:26.98,000 --> 0:03:29,000
It's painful, messy stuff.

59
0:03:31.14,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But it's the stuff.

60
0:03:32.58,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And I learned that when we approach it together,

61
0:03:36.94,000 --> 0:03:39,000
we get to decide what success looks like.

62
0:03:42.9,000 --> 0:03:45,000
One of the first things Paul said to me after his diagnosis was,

63
0:03:47.18,000 --> 0:03:48,000
"I want you to get remarried."

64
0:03:50.3,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And I was like, whoa, I guess we get to say anything out loud.

65
0:03:53.66,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:56.22,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It was so shocking

67
0:03:58.3,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and heartbreaking ...

68
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and generous,

69
0:04:02.5,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and really comforting

70
0:04:04.02,000 --> 0:04:06,000
because it was so starkly honest,

71
0:04:06.62,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and that honesty turned out to be exactly what we needed.

72
0:04:10.58,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Early in Paul's illness,

73
0:04:12.3,000 --> 0:04:15,000
we agreed we would just keep saying things out loud.

74
0:04:17.22,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Tasks like making a will,

75
0:04:19.54,000 --> 0:04:21,000
or completing our advance directives --

76
0:04:22.22,000 --> 0:04:24,000
tasks that I had always avoided --

77
0:04:24.82,000 --> 0:04:26,000
were not as daunting as they once seemed.

78
0:04:27.86,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I realized that completing an advance directive is an act of love --

79
0:04:33.3,000 --> 0:04:34,000
like a wedding vow.

80
0:04:35.54,000 --> 0:04:37,000
A pact to take care of someone,

81
0:04:37.82,000 --> 0:04:39,000
codifying the promise

82
0:04:40.14,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that til death do us part,

83
0:04:43.06,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I will be there.

84
0:04:45.78,000 --> 0:04:47,000
If needed, I will speak for you.

85
0:04:49.02,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I will honor your wishes.

86
0:04:53.1,000 --> 0:04:56,000
That paperwork became a tangible part of our love story.

87
0:04:58.86,000 --> 0:04:59,000
As physicians,

88
0:05:00.1,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Paul and I were in a good position

89
0:05:01.78,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to understand and even accept his diagnosis.

90
0:05:05.94,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We weren't angry about it,

91
0:05:07.3,000 --> 0:05:08,000
luckily,

92
0:05:08.54,000 --> 0:05:12,000
because we'd seen so many patients in devastating situations,

93
0:05:12.7,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and we knew that death is a part of life.

94
0:05:17.7,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But it's one thing to know that;

95
0:05:19.3,000 --> 0:05:2,000
it was a very different experience

96
0:05:20.98,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to actually live with the sadness and uncertainty of a serious illness.

97
0:05:26.54,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Huge strides are being made against lung cancer,

98
0:05:29.78,000 --> 0:05:33,000
but we knew that Paul likely had months to a few years left to live.

99
0:05:36.54,000 --> 0:05:37,000
During that time,

100
0:05:37.78,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Paul wrote about his transition from doctor to patient.

101
0:05:41.5,000 --> 0:05:45,000
He talked about feeling like he was suddenly at a crossroads,

102
0:05:45.58,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and how he would have thought he'd be able to see the path,

103
0:05:49.14,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that because he treated so many patients,

104
0:05:51.9,000 --> 0:05:53,000
maybe he could follow in their footsteps.

105
0:05:55.1,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But he was totally disoriented.

106
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Rather than a path,

107
0:06:00.06,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Paul wrote,

108
0:06:01.58,000 --> 0:06:03,000
"I saw instead

109
0:06:03.66,000 --> 0:06:07,000
only a harsh, vacant, gleaming white desert.

110
0:06:08.54,000 --> 0:06:11,000
As if a sandstorm had erased all familiarity.

111
0:06:12.98,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I had to face my mortality

112
0:06:15.82,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and try to understand what made my life worth living,

113
0:06:20.5,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and I needed my oncologist's help to do so."

114
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
The clinicians taking care of Paul

115
0:06:29.34,000 --> 0:06:33,000
gave me an even deeper appreciation for my colleagues in health care.

116
0:06:33.58,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We have a tough job.

117
0:06:35.58,000 --> 0:06:39,000
We're responsible for helping patients have clarity around their prognoses

118
0:06:40.38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and their treatment options,

119
0:06:42.38,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and that's never easy, but it's especially tough

120
0:06:44.9,000 --> 0:06:47,000
when you're dealing with potentially terminal illnesses like cancer.

121
0:06:50.14,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Some people don't want to know how long they have left,

122
0:06:53.86,000 --> 0:06:54,000
others do.

123
0:06:55.66,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Either way, we never have those answers.

124
0:07:00.02,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Sometimes we substitute hope

125
0:07:03.9,000 --> 0:07:05,000
by emphasizing the best-case scenario.

126
0:07:08.14,000 --> 0:07:1,000
In a survey of physicians,

127
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
55 percent said they painted a rosier picture

128
0:07:15.1,000 --> 0:07:16,000
than their honest opinion

129
0:07:16.58,000 --> 0:07:17,000
when describing a patient's prognosis.

130
0:07:19.78,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It's an instinct born out of kindness.

131
0:07:23.94,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But researchers have found

132
0:07:25.38,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that when people better understand the possible outcomes of an illness,

133
0:07:30.62,000 --> 0:07:31,000
they have less anxiety,

134
0:07:32.9,000 --> 0:07:33,000
greater ability to plan

135
0:07:35.66,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and less trauma for their families.

136
0:07:40.62,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Families can struggle with those conversations,

137
0:07:43.38,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but for us, we also found that information immensely helpful with big decisions.

138
0:07:50.74,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Most notably,

139
0:07:52.86,000 --> 0:07:53,000
whether to have a baby.

140
0:07:56.62,000 --> 0:08:,000
Months to a few years meant Paul was not likely to see her grow up.

141
0:08:02.66,000 --> 0:08:04,000
But he had a good chance of being there for her birth

142
0:08:05.18,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and for the beginning of her life.

143
0:08:08.46,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I remember asking Paul

144
0:08:10.46,000 --> 0:08:13,000
if he thought having to say goodbye to a child

145
0:08:13.86,000 --> 0:08:15,000
would make dying even more painful.

146
0:08:18.22,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And his answer astounded me.

147
0:08:20.1,000 --> 0:08:21,000
He said,

148
0:08:21.82,000 --> 0:08:23,000
"Wouldn't it be great if it did?"

149
0:08:27.86,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And we did it.

150
0:08:29.66,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Not in order to spite cancer,

151
0:08:33.34,000 --> 0:08:34,000
but because we were learning

152
0:08:35.22,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that living fully means accepting suffering.

153
0:08:43.7,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Paul's oncologist tailored his chemo

154
0:08:46.14,000 --> 0:08:49,000
so he could continue working as a neurosurgeon,

155
0:08:49.46,000 --> 0:08:51,000
which initially we thought was totally impossible.

156
0:08:53.34,000 --> 0:08:54,000
When the cancer advanced

157
0:08:54.66,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and Paul shifted from surgery to writing,

158
0:08:58.02,000 --> 0:09:01,000
his palliative care doctor prescribed a stimulant medication

159
0:09:01.38,000 --> 0:09:02,000
so he could be more focused.

160
0:09:04.42,000 --> 0:09:07,000
They asked Paul about his priorities and his worries.

161
0:09:08.9,000 --> 0:09:11,000
They asked him what trade-offs he was willing to make.

162
0:09:14.3,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Those conversations are the best way to ensure

163
0:09:18.46,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that your health care matches your values.

164
0:09:24.1,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Paul joked that it's not like that "birds and bees" talk

165
0:09:26.78,000 --> 0:09:27,000
you have with your parents,

166
0:09:28.14,000 --> 0:09:3,000
where you all get it over with as quickly as possible,

167
0:09:30.7,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and then pretend it never happened.

168
0:09:32.42,000 --> 0:09:34,000
You revisit the conversation as things change.

169
0:09:35.34,000 --> 0:09:37,000
You keep saying things out loud.

170
0:09:40.22,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I'm forever grateful

171
0:09:41.5,000 --> 0:09:43,000
because Paul's clinicians felt

172
0:09:43.9,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that their job wasn't to try to give us answers they didn't have,

173
0:09:47.02,000 --> 0:09:5,000
or only to try to fix things for us,

174
0:09:50.42,000 --> 0:09:52,000
but to counsel Paul through painful choices ...

175
0:09:54.14,000 --> 0:09:59,000
when his body was failing but his will to live wasn't.

176
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Later, after Paul died,

177
0:10:03.78,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I received a dozen bouquets of flowers,

178
0:10:06.5,000 --> 0:10:07,000
but I sent just one ...

179
0:10:08.9,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to Paul's oncologist,

180
0:10:10.98,000 --> 0:10:13,000
because she supported his goals

181
0:10:14.46,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and she helped him weigh his choices.

182
0:10:18.34,000 --> 0:10:22,000
She knew that living means more than just staying alive.

183
0:10:25.54,000 --> 0:10:27,000
A few weeks ago, a patient came into my clinic.

184
0:10:28.46,000 --> 0:10:31,000
A woman dealing with a serious chronic disease.

185
0:10:32.7,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And while we were talking about her life and her health care,

186
0:10:35.62,000 --> 0:10:38,000
she said, "I love my palliative care team.

187
0:10:39.98,000 --> 0:10:41,000
They taught me that it's OK to say 'no'."

188
0:10:43.46,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Yeah, I thought, of course it is.

189
0:10:46.66,000 --> 0:10:48,000
But many patients don't feel that.

190
0:10:50.66,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Compassion and Choices did a study

191
0:10:52.82,000 --> 0:10:55,000
where they asked people about their health care preferences.

192
0:10:56.58,000 --> 0:11:,000
And a lot of people started their answers with the words

193
0:11:00.66,000 --> 0:11:01,000
"Well, if I had a choice ..."

194
0:11:03.86,000 --> 0:11:04,000
If I had a choice.

195
0:11:06.7,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And when I read that "if,"

196
0:11:08.62,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I understood better

197
0:11:10.82,000 --> 0:11:12,000
why one in four people

198
0:11:13.7,000 --> 0:11:17,000
receives excessive or unwanted medical treatment,

199
0:11:18.58,000 --> 0:11:23,000
or watches a family member receive excessive or unwanted medical treatment.

200
0:11:25.42,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It's not because doctors don't get it.

201
0:11:27.54,000 --> 0:11:28,000
We do.

202
0:11:29.34,000 --> 0:11:31,000
We understand the real psychological consequences

203
0:11:32.3,000 --> 0:11:34,000
on patients and their families.

204
0:11:35.58,000 --> 0:11:36,000
The things is, we deal with them, too.

205
0:11:38.54,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Half of critical care nurses and a quarter of ICU doctors

206
0:11:43.9,000 --> 0:11:45,000
have considered quitting their jobs

207
0:11:46.46,000 --> 0:11:5,000
because of distress over feeling that for some of their patients,

208
0:11:51.38,000 --> 0:11:54,000
they've provided care that didn't fit with the person's values.

209
0:11:57.22,000 --> 0:11:59,000
But doctors can't make sure your wishes are respected

210
0:11:59.74,000 --> 0:12:01,000
until they know what they are.

211
0:12:03.82,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Would you want to be on life support if it offered any chance of longer life?

212
0:12:08.82,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Are you most worried about the quality of that time,

213
0:12:12.46,000 --> 0:12:13,000
rather than quantity?

214
0:12:14.54,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Both of those choices are thoughtful and brave,

215
0:12:19.02,000 --> 0:12:2,000
but for all of us, it's our choice.

216
0:12:22.02,000 --> 0:12:23,000
That's true at the end of life

217
0:12:24.74,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and for medical care throughout our lives.

218
0:12:27.34,000 --> 0:12:29,000
If you're pregnant, do you want genetic screening?

219
0:12:30.22,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Is a knee replacement right or not?

220
0:12:33.42,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Do you want to do dialysis in a clinic or at home?

221
0:12:38.42,000 --> 0:12:39,000
The answer is:

222
0:12:40.46,000 --> 0:12:41,000
it depends.

223
0:12:42.38,000 --> 0:12:46,000
What medical care will help you live the way you want to?

224
0:12:48.9,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I hope you remember that question

225
0:12:51.14,000 --> 0:12:54,000
the next time you face a decision in your health care.

226
0:12:55.02,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Remember that you always have a choice,

227
0:12:59.06,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and it is OK to say no to a treatment that's not right for you.

228
0:13:06.42,000 --> 0:13:09,000
There's a poem by W.S. Merwin --

229
0:13:09.82,000 --> 0:13:11,000
it's just two sentences long --

230
0:13:12.14,000 --> 0:13:14,000
that captures how I feel now.

231
0:13:16.82,000 --> 0:13:19,000
"Your absence has gone through me

232
0:13:19.94,000 --> 0:13:21,000
like thread through a needle.

233
0:13:23.62,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Everything I do is stitched with its color."

234
0:13:29.3,000 --> 0:13:32,000
For me that poem evokes my love for Paul,

235
0:13:33.34,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and a new fortitude

236
0:13:35.34,000 --> 0:13:38,000
that came from loving and losing him.

237
0:13:40.18,000 --> 0:13:42,000
When Paul said, "It's going to be OK,"

238
0:13:43.82,000 --> 0:13:46,000
that didn't mean that we could cure his illness.

239
0:13:48.42,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Instead, we learned to accept both joy and sadness at the same time;

240
0:13:55.06,000 --> 0:13:58,000
to uncover beauty and purpose

241
0:13:58.38,000 --> 0:14:02,000
both despite and because we are all born

242
0:14:03.34,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and we all die.

243
0:14:06.34,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And for all the sadness and sleepless nights,

244
0:14:09.7,000 --> 0:14:1,000
it turns out there is joy.

245
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I leave flowers on Paul's grave

246
0:14:14.9,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and watch our two-year-old run around on the grass.

247
0:14:19.06,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I build bonfires on the beach and watch the sunset with our friends.

248
0:14:25.34,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Exercise and mindfulness meditation have helped a lot.

249
0:14:30.62,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And someday,

250
0:14:31.94,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I hope I do get remarried.

251
0:14:36.38,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Most importantly, I get to watch our daughter grow.

252
0:14:40.54,000 --> 0:14:43,000
I've thought a lot about what I'm going to say to her

253
0:14:44.46,000 --> 0:14:45,000
when she's older.

254
0:14:48.22,000 --> 0:14:49,000
"Cady,

255
0:14:50.58,000 --> 0:14:53,000
engaging in the full range of experience --

256
0:14:53.82,000 --> 0:14:54,000
living and dying,

257
0:14:55.54,000 --> 0:14:56,000
love and loss --

258
0:14:57.86,000 --> 0:14:58,000
is what we get to do.

259
0:15:00.9,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Being human doesn't happen despite suffering.

260
0:15:07.5,000 --> 0:15:08,000
It happens within it.

261
0:15:10.78,000 --> 0:15:11,000
When we approach suffering together,

262
0:15:13.42,000 --> 0:15:15,000
when we choose not to hide from it,

263
0:15:16.9,000 --> 0:15:17,000
our lives don't diminish,

264
0:15:18.34,000 --> 0:15:19,000
they expand."

265
0:15:21.7,000 --> 0:15:23,000
I've learned that cancer isn't always a battle.

266
0:15:26.22,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Or if it is,

267
0:15:27.9,000 --> 0:15:3,000
maybe it's a fight for something different than we thought.

268
0:15:32.46,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Our job isn't to fight fate,

269
0:15:35.98,000 --> 0:15:36,000
but to help each other through.

270
0:15:39.1,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Not as soldiers

271
0:15:41.82,000 --> 0:15:42,000
but as shepherds.

272
0:15:45.74,000 --> 0:15:47,000
That's how we make it OK,

273
0:15:47.82,000 --> 0:15:48,000
even when it's not.

274
0:15:50.9,000 --> 0:15:51,000
By saying it out loud,

275
0:15:53.22,000 --> 0:15:54,000
by helping each other through ...

276
0:15:57.18,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and a gorilla suit never hurts, either.

277
0:16:00.1,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Thank you.

278
0:16:01.34,000 --> 0:16:08,000
(Applause)

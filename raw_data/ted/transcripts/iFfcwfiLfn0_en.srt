1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
As an artist,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
connection is very important to me.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Through my work I'm trying to articulate

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that humans are not separate from nature

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and that everything is interconnected.

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago,

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
where I saw my first icebergs.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I was in awe.

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy,

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The icebergs around me

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
were almost 200 feet out of the water,

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and I could only help but wonder

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that this was one snowflake

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
on top of another snowflake,

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
year after year.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Icebergs are born

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
when they calve off of glaciers

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
or break off of ice shelves.

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
They have a distinct way

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
of interacting with their environment

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and their experiences.

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Some refuse to give up

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and hold on to the bitter end,

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
while others can't take it anymore

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg,

29
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that they're isolated,

30
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that they're separate and alone,

31
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.

32
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But the reality is far from it.

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
As an iceberg melts,

34
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I am breathing in

35
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
its ancient atmosphere.

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
As the iceberg melts,

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water

38
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that nourishes many forms of life.

39
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I approach photographing these icebergs

40
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors,

41
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
knowing that in these individual moments

42
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
they exist in that way

43
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and will never exist that way again.

44
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
It is not a death when they melt;

45
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
it is not an end,

46
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but a continuation

47
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
of their path through the cycle of life.

48
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young --

49
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
a couple thousand years old.

50
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And some of the ice

51
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is over 100,000 years old.

52
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The last pictures I'd like to show you

53
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
are of an iceberg that I photographed

54
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.

55
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It's a very rare occasion

56
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that you get to actually witness

57
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
an iceberg rolling.

58
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So here it is.

59
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
You can see on the left side a small boat.

60
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
That's about a 15-foot boat.

61
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And I'd like you to pay attention

62
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to the shape of the iceberg

63
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and where it is at the waterline.

64
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
You can see here, it begins to roll,

65
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.

66
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.

67
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It's about 120 feet above the water,

68
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
or 40 meters.

69
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And this video is real time.

70
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Music)

71
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And just like that,

72
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.

73
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Thank you.

74
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.714,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Hi. I'm going to talk to you today about laughter,

2
0:00:15.918,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and I just want to start by thinking about the first time

3
0:00:18.707,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I can ever remember noticing laughter.

4
0:00:20.736,000 --> 0:00:22,000
This is when I was a little girl. I would've been about six.

5
0:00:23.558,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And I came across my parents doing something unusual,

6
0:00:27.113,000 --> 0:00:28,000
where they were laughing.

7
0:00:28.619,000 --> 0:00:3,000
They were laughing very, very hard.

8
0:00:30.686,000 --> 0:00:31,000
They were lying on the floor laughing.

9
0:00:32.59,000 --> 0:00:33,000
They were screaming with laughter.

10
0:00:34.54,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I did not know what they were laughing at, but I wanted in.

11
0:00:38.767,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I wanted to be part of that,

12
0:00:40.471,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and I kind of sat around at the edge going, "Hoo hoo!" (Laughter)

13
0:00:43.57,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Now, incidentally, what they were laughing at

14
0:00:47.009,000 --> 0:00:49,000
was a song which people used to sing,

15
0:00:49.609,000 --> 0:00:52,000
which was based around signs in toilets on trains

16
0:00:53.255,000 --> 0:00:55,000
telling you what you could and could not do

17
0:00:56.25,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in toilets on trains.

18
0:00:57.69,000 --> 0:01:,000
And the thing you have to remember about the English is, of course,

19
0:01:00.893,000 --> 0:01:02,000
we do have an immensely sophisticated sense of humor.

20
0:01:03.616,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:04.775,000 --> 0:01:06,000
At the time, though, I didn't understand anything of that.

22
0:01:07.508,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I just cared about the laughter,

23
0:01:09.067,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and actually, as a neuroscientist, I've come to care about it again.

24
0:01:12.419,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And it is a really weird thing to do.

25
0:01:15.176,000 --> 0:01:17,000
What I'm going to do now is just play some examples

26
0:01:17.593,000 --> 0:01:18,000
of real human beings laughing,

27
0:01:19.144,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and I want you think about the sound people make and how odd that can be,

28
0:01:22.627,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and in fact how primitive laughter is as a sound.

29
0:01:25.204,000 --> 0:01:27,000
It's much more like an animal call than it is like speech.

30
0:01:28.013,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So here we've got some laughter for you. The first one is pretty joyful.

31
0:01:31.487,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Audio: Laughing)

32
0:01:47.406,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Now this next guy, I need him to breathe.

33
0:01:50.081,000 --> 0:01:52,000
There's a point in there where I'm just, like,

34
0:01:52.233,000 --> 0:01:54,000
you've got to get some air in there, mate,

35
0:01:54.255,000 --> 0:01:56,000
because he just sounds like he's breathing out.

36
0:01:56.46,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Audio: Laughing)

37
0:02:05.187,000 --> 0:02:07,000
This hasn't been edited; this is him.

38
0:02:08.182,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Audio: Laughing) (Laughter)

39
0:02:14.544,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And finally we have -- this is a human female laughing.

40
0:02:18.283,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And laughter can take us to some pretty odd places in terms of making noises.

41
0:02:22.346,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Audio: Laughing)

42
0:02:41.953,000 --> 0:02:43,000
She actually says, "Oh my God, what is that?" in French.

43
0:02:44.613,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We're all kind of with her. I have no idea.

44
0:02:48.179,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Now, to understand laughter, you have to look at a part of the body

45
0:02:51.606,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that psychologists and neuroscientists don't normally spend much time looking at,

46
0:02:55.43,000 --> 0:02:56,000
which is the ribcage,

47
0:02:56.495,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and it doesn't seem terribly exciting,

48
0:02:58.311,000 --> 0:03:,000
but actually you're all using your ribcage all the time.

49
0:03:00.99,000 --> 0:03:02,000
What you're all doing at the moment with your ribcage,

50
0:03:03.573,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and don't stop doing it, is breathing.

51
0:03:05.413,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So you use the intercostal muscles, the muscles between your ribs,

52
0:03:08.563,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to bring air in and out of your lungs

53
0:03:10.34,000 --> 0:03:12,000
just by expanding and contracting your ribcage,

54
0:03:12.53,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and if I was to put a strap around the outside of your chest

55
0:03:15.408,000 --> 0:03:17,000
called a breath belt, and just look at that movement,

56
0:03:17.978,000 --> 0:03:2,000
you see a rather gentle sinusoidal movement, so that's breathing.

57
0:03:21.132,000 --> 0:03:22,000
You're all doing it. Don't stop.

58
0:03:22.71,000 --> 0:03:23,000
As soon as you start talking,

59
0:03:24.104,000 --> 0:03:26,000
you start using your breathing completely differently.

60
0:03:26.731,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So what I'm doing now is you see something much more like this.

61
0:03:29.678,000 --> 0:03:31,000
In talking, you use very fine movements of the ribcage

62
0:03:32.271,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to squeeze the air out --

63
0:03:33.651,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and in fact, we're the only animals that can do this.

64
0:03:36.14,000 --> 0:03:37,000
It's why we can talk at all.

65
0:03:37.681,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Now, both talking and breathing has a mortal enemy,

66
0:03:40.843,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and that enemy is laughter,

67
0:03:43.209,000 --> 0:03:45,000
because what happens when you laugh

68
0:03:45.658,000 --> 0:03:48,000
is those same muscles start to contract very regularly,

69
0:03:48.959,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and you get this very marked sort of zig-zagging,

70
0:03:51.377,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and that's just squeezing the air out of you.

71
0:03:53.56,000 --> 0:03:55,000
It literally is that basic a way of making a sound.

72
0:03:56.027,000 --> 0:03:58,000
You could be stamping on somebody, it's having the same effect.

73
0:03:59.023,000 --> 0:04:,000
You're just squeezing air out,

74
0:04:00.507,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and each of those contractions -- Ha! -- gives you a sound.

75
0:04:03.34,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And as the contractions run together, you can get these spasms,

76
0:04:06.303,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and that's when you start getting these -- (Wheezing) -- things happening.

77
0:04:10.083,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I'm brilliant at this. (Laughter)

78
0:04:13.577,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Now, in terms of the science of laughter, there isn't very much,

79
0:04:17.802,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but it does turn out that pretty much everything we think we know

80
0:04:20.85,000 --> 0:04:22,000
about laughter is wrong.

81
0:04:23.042,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So it's not at all unusual, for example, to hear people to say

82
0:04:25.998,000 --> 0:04:27,000
humans are the only animals that laugh.

83
0:04:28.001,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Nietzsche thought that humans are the only animals that laugh.

84
0:04:30.934,000 --> 0:04:32,000
In fact, you find laughter throughout the mammals.

85
0:04:33.387,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It's been well-described and well-observed in primates,

86
0:04:35.973,000 --> 0:04:36,000
but you also see it in rats,

87
0:04:37.377,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and wherever you find it --

88
0:04:38.683,000 --> 0:04:4,000
humans, primates, rats --

89
0:04:40.789,000 --> 0:04:43,000
you find it associated with things like tickling.

90
0:04:43.808,000 --> 0:04:46,000
That's the same for humans.

91
0:04:46.896,000 --> 0:04:5,000
You find it associated with play, and all mammals play.

92
0:04:51.563,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And wherever you find it, it's associated with interactions.

93
0:04:55.557,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So Robert Provine, who has done a lot of work on this,

94
0:04:58.147,000 --> 0:05:02,000
has pointed out that you are 30 times more likely to laugh

95
0:05:02.987,000 --> 0:05:05,000
if you are with somebody else than if you're on your own,

96
0:05:06.353,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and where you find most laughter

97
0:05:08.257,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is in social interactions like conversation.

98
0:05:10.984,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So if you ask human beings, "When do you laugh?"

99
0:05:13.226,000 --> 0:05:16,000
they'll talk about comedy and they'll talk about humor and they'll talk about jokes.

100
0:05:17.177,000 --> 0:05:2,000
If you look at when they laugh, they're laughing with their friends.

101
0:05:20.376,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And when we laugh with people, we're hardly ever actually laughing at jokes.

102
0:05:23.963,000 --> 0:05:25,000
You are laughing to show people that you understand them,

103
0:05:26.626,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that you agree with them, that you're part of the same group as them.

104
0:05:29.874,000 --> 0:05:3,000
You're laughing to show that you like them.

105
0:05:31.873,000 --> 0:05:32,000
You might even love them.

106
0:05:33.078,000 --> 0:05:35,000
You're doing all that at the same time as talking to them,

107
0:05:35.788,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and the laughter is doing a lot of that emotional work for you.

108
0:05:38.808,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Something that Robert Provine has pointed out, as you can see here,

109
0:05:41.986,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and the reason why we were laughing

110
0:05:43.665,000 --> 0:05:45,000
when we heard those funny laughs at the start,

111
0:05:45.806,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and why I was laughing when I found my parents laughing,

112
0:05:48.511,000 --> 0:05:5,000
is that it's an enormously behaviorally contagious effect.

113
0:05:51.346,000 --> 0:05:53,000
You can catch laughter from somebody else,

114
0:05:53.44,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and you are more likely to catch laughter off somebody else if you know them.

115
0:05:57.099,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So it's still modulated by this social context.

116
0:05:59.358,000 --> 0:06:,000
You have to put humor to one side

117
0:06:00.946,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and think about the social meaning of laughter

118
0:06:03.167,000 --> 0:06:05,000
because that's where its origins lie.

119
0:06:05.255,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Now, something I've got very interested in is different kinds of laughter,

120
0:06:09.435,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and we have some neurobiological evidence about how human beings vocalize

121
0:06:14.148,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that suggests there might be two kinds of laughs that we have.

122
0:06:18.281,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So it seems possible that the neurobiology for helpless, involuntary laughter,

123
0:06:23.227,000 --> 0:06:26,000
like my parents lying on the floor screaming about a silly song,

124
0:06:26.431,000 --> 0:06:29,000
might have a different basis to it than some of that more polite

125
0:06:29.465,000 --> 0:06:32,000
social laughter that you encounter, which isn't horrible laughter,

126
0:06:32.631,000 --> 0:06:36,000
but it's behavior somebody is doing as part of their communicative act to you,

127
0:06:36.949,000 --> 0:06:39,000
part of their interaction with you; they are choosing to do this.

128
0:06:40.05,000 --> 0:06:43,000
In our evolution, we have developed two different ways of vocalizing.

129
0:06:43.439,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Involuntary vocalizations are part of an older system

130
0:06:46.356,000 --> 0:06:49,000
than the more voluntary vocalizations like the speech I'm doing now.

131
0:06:49.559,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So we might imagine that laughter might actually have two different roots.

132
0:06:53.04,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So I've been looking at this in more detail.

133
0:06:55.088,000 --> 0:06:58,000
To do this, we've had to make recordings of people laughing,

134
0:06:58.311,000 --> 0:07:,000
and we've had to do whatever it takes to make people laugh,

135
0:07:01.088,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and we got those same people to produce more posed, social laughter.

136
0:07:04.297,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So imagine your friend told a joke,

137
0:07:05.965,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and you're laughing because you like your friend,

138
0:07:08.253,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but not really because the joke's all that.

139
0:07:10.261,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So I'm going to play you a couple of those.

140
0:07:12.354,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I want you to tell me if you think this laughter is real laughter,

141
0:07:15.507,000 --> 0:07:16,000
or if you think it's posed.

142
0:07:16.806,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So is this involuntary laughter or more voluntary laughter?

143
0:07:19.742,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Audio: Laughing)

144
0:07:24.622,000 --> 0:07:25,000
What does that sound like to you?

145
0:07:26.237,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Audience: Posed. Sophie Scott: Posed? Posed.

146
0:07:28.31,000 --> 0:07:29,000
How about this one?

147
0:07:29.819,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Audio: Laughing)

148
0:07:34.37,000 --> 0:07:35,000
(Laughter)

149
0:07:35.802,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I'm the best.

150
0:07:37.218,000 --> 0:07:39,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

151
0:07:39.857,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Not really.

152
0:07:41.593,000 --> 0:07:43,000
No, that was helpless laughter,

153
0:07:43.843,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and in fact, to record that, all they had to do was record me

154
0:07:47.118,000 --> 0:07:5,000
watching one of my friends listening to something I knew she wanted to laugh at,

155
0:07:50.895,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and I just started doing this.

156
0:07:52.365,000 --> 0:07:55,000
What you find is that people are good at telling the difference

157
0:07:55.582,000 --> 0:07:56,000
between real and posed laughter.

158
0:07:57.127,000 --> 0:07:58,000
They seem to be different things to us.

159
0:07:59.041,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Interestingly, you see something quite similar with chimpanzees.

160
0:08:02.073,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Chimpanzees laugh differently if they're being tickled

161
0:08:04.621,000 --> 0:08:05,000
than if they're playing with each other,

162
0:08:06.59,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and we might be seeing something like that here,

163
0:08:08.852,000 --> 0:08:11,000
involuntary laughter, tickling laughter, being different from social laughter.

164
0:08:12.546,000 --> 0:08:13,000
They're acoustically very different.

165
0:08:14.287,000 --> 0:08:16,000
The real laughs are longer. They're higher in pitch.

166
0:08:16.779,000 --> 0:08:17,000
When you start laughing hard,

167
0:08:18.198,000 --> 0:08:2,000
you start squeezing air out from your lungs

168
0:08:20.251,000 --> 0:08:23,000
under much higher pressures than you could ever produce voluntarily.

169
0:08:23.442,000 --> 0:08:25,000
For example, I could never pitch my voice that high to sing.

170
0:08:26.364,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Also, you start to get these sort of contractions and weird whistling sounds,

171
0:08:30.032,000 --> 0:08:32,000
all of which mean that real laughter is extremely easy,

172
0:08:32.798,000 --> 0:08:34,000
or feels extremely easy to spot.

173
0:08:34.87,000 --> 0:08:39,000
In contrast, posed laughter, we might think it sounds a bit fake.

174
0:08:39.952,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Actually, it's not, it's actually an important social cue.

175
0:08:42.692,000 --> 0:08:45,000
We use it a lot, we're choosing to laugh in a lot of situations,

176
0:08:45.769,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and it seems to be its own thing.

177
0:08:47.382,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So, for example, you find nasality in posed laughter,

178
0:08:50.169,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that kind of "ha ha ha ha ha" sound

179
0:08:52.276,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that you never get, you could not do, if you were laughing involuntarily.

180
0:08:55.723,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So they do seem to be genuinely these two different sorts of things.

181
0:08:58.955,000 --> 0:09:,000
We took it into the scanner to see how brains respond

182
0:09:01.505,000 --> 0:09:02,000
when you hear laughter.

183
0:09:02.717,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And when you do this, this is a really boring experiment.

184
0:09:05.385,000 --> 0:09:07,000
We just played people real and posed laughs.

185
0:09:07.43,000 --> 0:09:09,000
We didn't tell them it was a study on laughter.

186
0:09:09.634,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We put other sounds in there to distract them,

187
0:09:11.833,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and all they're doing is lying listening to sounds.

188
0:09:14.22,000 --> 0:09:15,000
We don't tell them to do anything.

189
0:09:15.863,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Nonetheless, when you hear real laughter and when you hear posed laughter,

190
0:09:19.337,000 --> 0:09:21,000
the brains are responding completely differently,

191
0:09:21.754,000 --> 0:09:22,000
significantly differently.

192
0:09:23.186,000 --> 0:09:26,000
What you see in the regions in blue, which lies in auditory cortex,

193
0:09:26.734,000 --> 0:09:28,000
are the brain areas that respond more to the real laughs,

194
0:09:29.423,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and what seems to be the case,

195
0:09:30.864,000 --> 0:09:32,000
when you hear somebody laughing involuntarily,

196
0:09:33.021,000 --> 0:09:35,000
you hear sounds you would never hear in any other context.

197
0:09:35.748,000 --> 0:09:36,000
It's very unambiguous,

198
0:09:36.834,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and it seems to be associated with greater auditory processing

199
0:09:39.904,000 --> 0:09:4,000
of these novel sounds.

200
0:09:41.274,000 --> 0:09:44,000
In contrast, when you hear somebody laughing in a posed way,

201
0:09:45.083,000 --> 0:09:47,000
what you see are these regions in pink,

202
0:09:47.125,000 --> 0:09:49,000
which are occupying brain areas associated with mentalizing,

203
0:09:50.004,000 --> 0:09:52,000
thinking about what somebody else is thinking.

204
0:09:52.159,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And I think what that means is,

205
0:09:53.699,000 --> 0:09:56,000
even if you're having your brain scanned, which is completely boring

206
0:09:56.896,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and not very interesting,

207
0:09:58.096,000 --> 0:10:,000
when you hear somebody going, "A ha ha ha ha ha,"

208
0:10:00.429,000 --> 0:10:02,000
you're trying to work out why they're laughing.

209
0:10:02.625,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Laughter is always meaningful.

210
0:10:04.07,000 --> 0:10:06,000
You are always trying to understand it in context,

211
0:10:06.41,000 --> 0:10:08,000
even if, as far as you are concerned, at that point in time,

212
0:10:09.276,000 --> 0:10:11,000
it has not necessarily anything to do with you,

213
0:10:11.463,000 --> 0:10:13,000
you still want to know why those people are laughing.

214
0:10:14.135,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Now, we've had the opportunity to look at how people hear real and posed laughter

215
0:10:18.001,000 --> 0:10:19,000
across the age range.

216
0:10:19.064,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So this is an online experiment we ran with the Royal Society,

217
0:10:21.995,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and here we just asked people two questions.

218
0:10:24.099,000 --> 0:10:25,000
First of all, they heard some laughs,

219
0:10:25.927,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and they had to say, how real or posed do these laughs sound?

220
0:10:28.946,000 --> 0:10:31,000
The real laughs are shown in red and the posed laughs are shown in blue.

221
0:10:32.403,000 --> 0:10:33,000
What you see is there is a rapid onset.

222
0:10:34.3,000 --> 0:10:37,000
As you get older, you get better and better at spotting real laughter.

223
0:10:37.652,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So six-year-olds are at chance, they can't really hear the difference.

224
0:10:40.977,000 --> 0:10:42,000
By the time you are older, you get better,

225
0:10:43.129,000 --> 0:10:46,000
but interestingly, you do not hit peak performance in this dataset

226
0:10:46.751,000 --> 0:10:49,000
until you are in your late 30s and early 40s.

227
0:10:50.282,000 --> 0:10:53,000
You don't understand laughter fully by the time you hit puberty.

228
0:10:53.323,000 --> 0:10:56,000
You don't understand laughter fully by the time your brain has matured

229
0:10:56.62,000 --> 0:10:57,000
at the end of your teens.

230
0:10:58.014,000 --> 0:11:01,000
You're learning about laughter throughout your entire early adult life.

231
0:11:01.812,000 --> 0:11:04,000
If we turn the question around and now say not, what does the laughter sound like

232
0:11:05.614,000 --> 0:11:07,000
in terms of being real or posed, but we say,

233
0:11:07.666,000 --> 0:11:09,000
how much does this laughter make you want to laugh,

234
0:11:10.15,000 --> 0:11:13,000
how contagious is this laughter to you, we see a different profile.

235
0:11:13.365,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And here, the younger you are,

236
0:11:14.868,000 --> 0:11:16,000
the more you want to join in when you hear laughter.

237
0:11:17.302,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Remember me laughing with my parents when I had no idea what was going on.

238
0:11:20.795,000 --> 0:11:21,000
You really can see this.

239
0:11:22.021,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Now everybody, young and old,

240
0:11:23.416,000 --> 0:11:25,000
finds the real laughs more contagious than the posed laughs,

241
0:11:26.261,000 --> 0:11:28,000
but as you get older, it all becomes less contagious to you.

242
0:11:29.171,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Now, either we're all just becoming really grumpy as we get older,

243
0:11:33.375,000 --> 0:11:35,000
or it may mean that as you understand laughter better,

244
0:11:36.304,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and you are getting better at doing that,

245
0:11:38.393,000 --> 0:11:4,000
you need more than just hearing people laugh to want to laugh.

246
0:11:41.339,000 --> 0:11:43,000
You need the social stuff there.

247
0:11:43.986,000 --> 0:11:44,000
So we've got a very interesting behavior

248
0:11:45.96,000 --> 0:11:48,000
about which a lot of our lay assumptions are incorrect,

249
0:11:49.113,000 --> 0:11:52,000
but I'm coming to see that actually there's even more to laughter

250
0:11:52.964,000 --> 0:11:54,000
than it's an important social emotion we should look at,

251
0:11:55.695,000 --> 0:11:57,000
because it turns out people are phenomenally nuanced

252
0:11:58.614,000 --> 0:11:59,000
in terms of how we use laughter.

253
0:12:00.201,000 --> 0:12:02,000
There's a really lovely set of studies coming out

254
0:12:02.485,000 --> 0:12:04,000
from Robert Levenson's lab in California,

255
0:12:04.579,000 --> 0:12:06,000
where he's doing a longitudinal study with couples.

256
0:12:07.055,000 --> 0:12:09,000
He gets married couples, men and women, into the lab,

257
0:12:09.838,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and he gives them stressful conversations to have

258
0:12:12.132,000 --> 0:12:15,000
while he wires them up to a polygraph so he can see them becoming stressed.

259
0:12:15.664,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So you've got the two of them in there, and he'll say to the husband,

260
0:12:18.899,000 --> 0:12:2,000
"Tell me something that your wife does that irritates you."

261
0:12:21.681,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And what you see is immediately --

262
0:12:23.297,000 --> 0:12:26,000
just run that one through your head briefly, you and your partner --

263
0:12:26.624,000 --> 0:12:3,000
you can imagine everybody gets a bit more stressed as soon as that starts.

264
0:12:30.772,000 --> 0:12:32,000
You can see physically, people become more stressed.

265
0:12:33.396,000 --> 0:12:38,000
What he finds is that the couples who manage that feeling of stress

266
0:12:39.178,000 --> 0:12:42,000
with laughter, positive emotions like laughter,

267
0:12:42.684,000 --> 0:12:45,000
not only immediately become less stressed,

268
0:12:46.492,000 --> 0:12:48,000
they can see them physically feeling better,

269
0:12:48.906,000 --> 0:12:51,000
they're dealing with this unpleasant situation better together,

270
0:12:52.064,000 --> 0:12:53,000
they are also the couples that report

271
0:12:53.885,000 --> 0:12:55,000
high levels of satisfaction in their relationship

272
0:12:56.244,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and they stay together for longer.

273
0:12:57.915,000 --> 0:12:59,000
So in fact, when you look at close relationships,

274
0:13:00.236,000 --> 0:13:01,000
laughter is a phenomenally useful index

275
0:13:02.134,000 --> 0:13:04,000
of how people are regulating their emotions together.

276
0:13:04.607,000 --> 0:13:07,000
We're not just emitting it at each other to show that we like each other,

277
0:13:08.032,000 --> 0:13:1,000
we're making ourselves feel better together.

278
0:13:10.087,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Now, I don't think this is going to be limited to romantic relationships.

279
0:13:13.538,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I think this is probably going to be a characteristic

280
0:13:16.011,000 --> 0:13:19,000
of close emotional relationships such as you might have with friends,

281
0:13:19.329,000 --> 0:13:2,000
which explains my next clip,

282
0:13:21.158,000 --> 0:13:24,000
which is of a YouTube video of some young men in the former East Germany

283
0:13:24.803,000 --> 0:13:27,000
on making a video to promote their heavy metal band,

284
0:13:28.309,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and it's extremely macho, and the mood is very serious,

285
0:13:31.211,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and I want you to notice what happens in terms of laughter

286
0:13:34.323,000 --> 0:13:35,000
when things go wrong

287
0:13:36.273,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and how quickly that happens, and how that changes the mood.

288
0:13:41.869,000 --> 0:13:44,000
He's cold. He's about to get wet. He's got swimming trunks on,

289
0:13:44.911,000 --> 0:13:47,000
got a towel.

290
0:13:48.649,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Ice.

291
0:13:50.321,000 --> 0:13:52,000
What might possibly happen?

292
0:13:54.593,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Video starts.

293
0:13:57.663,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Serious mood.

294
0:14:06.744,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And his friends are already laughing. They are already laughing, hard.

295
0:14:11.249,000 --> 0:14:12,000
He's not laughing yet.

296
0:14:14.863,000 --> 0:14:15,000
(Laughter)

297
0:14:16.512,000 --> 0:14:18,000
He's starting to go now.

298
0:14:25.461,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And now they're all off.

299
0:14:27.518,000 --> 0:14:32,000
(Laughter)

300
0:14:44.653,000 --> 0:14:45,000
They're on the floor.

301
0:14:46.395,000 --> 0:14:49,000
(Laughter)

302
0:14:55.727,000 --> 0:14:58,000
The thing I really like about that is it's all very serious

303
0:14:59.039,000 --> 0:15:02,000
until he jumps onto the ice, and as soon as he doesn't go through the ice,

304
0:15:02.764,000 --> 0:15:04,000
but also there isn't blood and bone everywhere,

305
0:15:05.027,000 --> 0:15:06,000
his friends start laughing.

306
0:15:06.6,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And imagine if that had played him out with him standing there going,

307
0:15:09.992,000 --> 0:15:11,000
"No seriously, Heinrich, I think this is broken,"

308
0:15:12.436,000 --> 0:15:14,000
we wouldn't enjoy watching that. That would be stressful.

309
0:15:15.186,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Or if he was running around with a visibly broken leg laughing,

310
0:15:18.179,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and his friends are going, "Heinrich, I think we need to go to the hospital now,"

311
0:15:22.01,000 --> 0:15:23,000
that also wouldn't be funny.

312
0:15:23.407,000 --> 0:15:24,000
The fact that the laughter works,

313
0:15:25.069,000 --> 0:15:27,000
it gets him from a painful, embarrassing, difficult situation,

314
0:15:28.031,000 --> 0:15:31,000
into a funny situation, into what we're actually enjoying there,

315
0:15:31.116,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and I think that's a really interesting use,

316
0:15:33.303,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and it's actually happening all the time.

317
0:15:35.281,000 --> 0:15:37,000
For example, I can remember something like this happening

318
0:15:37.972,000 --> 0:15:38,000
at my father's funeral.

319
0:15:39.169,000 --> 0:15:41,000
We weren't jumping around on the ice in our underpants.

320
0:15:41.784,000 --> 0:15:43,000
We're not Canadian.

321
0:15:44.425,000 --> 0:15:46,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

322
0:15:46.924,000 --> 0:15:49,000
These events are always difficult, I had a relative who was being a bit difficult,

323
0:15:50.807,000 --> 0:15:51,000
my mum was not in a good place,

324
0:15:52.337,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and I can remember finding myself just before the whole thing started

325
0:15:55.621,000 --> 0:15:59,000
telling this story about something that happened in a 1970s sitcom,

326
0:15:59.868,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and I just thought at the time, I don't know why I'm doing this,

327
0:16:02.306,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and what I realized I was doing

328
0:16:04.484,000 --> 0:16:06,000
was I was coming up with something from somewhere

329
0:16:07.182,000 --> 0:16:11,000
I could use to make her laugh together with me.

330
0:16:11.571,000 --> 0:16:14,000
It was a very basic reaction to find some reason we can do this.

331
0:16:14.884,000 --> 0:16:16,000
We can laugh together. We're going to get through this.

332
0:16:17.569,000 --> 0:16:18,000
We're going to be okay.

333
0:16:19.065,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And in fact, all of us are doing this all the time.

334
0:16:21.496,000 --> 0:16:23,000
You do it so often, you don't even notice it.

335
0:16:23.686,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Everybody underestimates how often they laugh,

336
0:16:26.101,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and you're doing something, when you laugh with people,

337
0:16:29.119,000 --> 0:16:33,000
that's actually letting you access a really ancient evolutionary system

338
0:16:33.949,000 --> 0:16:36,000
that mammals have evolved to make and maintain social bonds,

339
0:16:37.756,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and clearly to regulate emotions, to make ourselves feel better.

340
0:16:41.146,000 --> 0:16:44,000
It's not something specific to humans -- it's a really ancient behavior

341
0:16:44.536,000 --> 0:16:48,000
which really helps us regulate how we feel and makes us feel better.

342
0:16:48.6,000 --> 0:16:5,000
In other words, when it comes to laughter,

343
0:16:51.502,000 --> 0:16:53,000
you and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals. (Laughter)

344
0:16:54.172,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Thank you.

345
0:16:56.517,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Thank you. (Applause)

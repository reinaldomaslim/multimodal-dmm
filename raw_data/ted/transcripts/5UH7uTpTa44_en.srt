1
0:00:12.855,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Two years ago, I set off from central London on the Tube

2
0:00:16.345,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and ended up somewhere in the east of the city

3
0:00:18.667,000 --> 0:00:19,000
walking into a self-storage unit

4
0:00:20.604,000 --> 0:00:23,000
to meet a guy that had 2,000 luxury polo shirts for sale.

5
0:00:25.18,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And as I made my way down the corridor,

6
0:00:27.129,000 --> 0:00:29,000
a broken, blinking light made it just like the cliche scene

7
0:00:30.146,000 --> 0:00:31,000
from a gangster movie.

8
0:00:32.462,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Our man was early, and he was waiting for me

9
0:00:34.668,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in front of a unit secured with four padlocks down the side.

10
0:00:38.043,000 --> 0:00:39,000
On our opening exchange,

11
0:00:39.604,000 --> 0:00:4,000
it was like a verbal sparring match

12
0:00:41.367,000 --> 0:00:42,000
where he threw the first punches.

13
0:00:43.401,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Who was I? Did I have a business card?

14
0:00:45.939,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And where was I going to sell?

15
0:00:47.886,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And then, he just started opening up,

16
0:00:50.59,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and it was my turn.

17
0:00:52.433,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Where were the polo shirts coming from?

18
0:00:54.403,000 --> 0:00:55,000
What paperwork did he have?

19
0:00:56.501,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And when was his next shipment going to arrive?

20
0:00:59.056,000 --> 0:01:,000
I was treading the fine line

21
0:01:00.414,000 --> 0:01:02,000
between asking enough questions to get what I needed

22
0:01:03.193,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and not enough for him to become suspicious,

23
0:01:05.764,000 --> 0:01:09,000
because what he didn't know is that I'm a counterfeit investigator,

24
0:01:10.318,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:11.705,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and after 20 minutes or so of checking over the product

26
0:01:14.492,000 --> 0:01:17,000
for the telltale signs of counterfeit production --

27
0:01:18.031,000 --> 0:01:2,000
say, badly stitched labels or how the packaging

28
0:01:20.381,000 --> 0:01:22,000
had a huge brand logo stamped all over the front of it --

29
0:01:23.23,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I was finally on my way out,

30
0:01:25.15,000 --> 0:01:28,000
but not before he insisted on walking down to the street with me

31
0:01:28.245,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and back to the station.

32
0:01:31.237,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And the feeling after these meetings is always the same:

33
0:01:33.929,000 --> 0:01:35,000
my heart is beating like a drum,

34
0:01:36.033,000 --> 0:01:38,000
because you never know if they've actually bought your story,

35
0:01:38.952,000 --> 0:01:41,000
or they're going to start following you to see who you really are.

36
0:01:42.104,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Relief only comes when you turn the first corner

37
0:01:44.478,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and glance behind, and they're not standing there.

38
0:01:48.171,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But what our counterfeit polo shirt seller certainly didn't realize

39
0:01:51.376,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is that everything I'd seen and heard would result in a dawn raid on his house,

40
0:01:55.161,000 --> 0:01:57,000
him being woken out of bed by eight men on his doorstep

41
0:01:57.972,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and all his product seized.

42
0:02:00.557,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But this would reveal that he was just a pawn

43
0:02:04.064,000 --> 0:02:07,000
at the end of a counterfeiting network spanning three continents,

44
0:02:07.546,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and he was just the first loose thread that I'd started to pull on

45
0:02:10.688,000 --> 0:02:11,000
in the hope that it would all unravel.

46
0:02:13.697,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Why go through all that trouble?

47
0:02:16.358,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Well, maybe counterfeiting is a victimless crime?

48
0:02:19.365,000 --> 0:02:21,000
These big companies, they make enough money,

49
0:02:21.499,000 --> 0:02:22,000
so if anything,

50
0:02:22.794,000 --> 0:02:24,000
counterfeiting is just a free form of advertising, right?

51
0:02:26.17,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And consumers believe just that --

52
0:02:28.57,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that the buying and selling of fakes is not that big a deal.

53
0:02:32.11,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But I'm here to tell you that that is just not true.

54
0:02:36.848,000 --> 0:02:39,000
What the tourist on holiday doesn't see about those fake handbags

55
0:02:40.801,000 --> 0:02:42,000
is they may well have been stitched together

56
0:02:43.261,000 --> 0:02:46,000
by a child who was trafficked away from her family,

57
0:02:46.774,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and what the car repair shop owner doesn't realize

58
0:02:49.27,000 --> 0:02:51,000
about those fake brake pads

59
0:02:51.427,000 --> 0:02:54,000
is they may well be lining the pockets of an organized crime gang

60
0:02:54.793,000 --> 0:02:56,000
involved in drugs and prostitution.

61
0:02:57.95,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And while those two things are horrible to think about,

62
0:03:00.864,000 --> 0:03:02,000
it gets much worse,

63
0:03:03.196,000 --> 0:03:05,000
because counterfeiting is even funding terrorism.

64
0:03:07.043,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Let that sink in for a moment.

65
0:03:09.567,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Terrorists are selling fakes to fund attacks,

66
0:03:12.42,000 --> 0:03:15,000
attacks in our cities that try to make victims of all of us.

67
0:03:17.442,000 --> 0:03:19,000
You wouldn't buy a live scorpion,

68
0:03:19.705,000 --> 0:03:22,000
because there's a chance that it would sting you on the way home,

69
0:03:22.777,000 --> 0:03:23,000
but would you still buy a fake handbag

70
0:03:24.784,000 --> 0:03:27,000
if you knew the profits would enable someone to buy bullets

71
0:03:28.307,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that would kill you and other innocent people six months later?

72
0:03:32.594,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Maybe not.

73
0:03:34.552,000 --> 0:03:35,000
OK, time to come clean.

74
0:03:36.668,000 --> 0:03:37,000
In my youth --

75
0:03:37.843,000 --> 0:03:39,000
yeah, I might look like I'm still clinging on to it a bit --

76
0:03:40.72,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I bought fake watches while on holiday in the Canary Islands.

77
0:03:44.395,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But why do I tell you this?

78
0:03:46.229,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Well, we've all done it,

79
0:03:48.705,000 --> 0:03:49,000
or we know someone that's done it.

80
0:03:50.404,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And until this very moment, maybe you didn't think twice about it,

81
0:03:54.071,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and nor did I,

82
0:03:55.471,000 --> 0:03:57,000
until I answered a 20-word cryptic advert

83
0:03:58.122,000 --> 0:04:,000
to become an intellectual property investigator.

84
0:04:02.086,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It said "Full training given and some international travel."

85
0:04:05.152,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Within a week, I was creating my first of many aliases,

86
0:04:08.925,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and in the 10 years since, I've investigated fake car parts,

87
0:04:12.027,000 --> 0:04:15,000
alloy wheels, fake pet grooming tools,

88
0:04:15.265,000 --> 0:04:16,000
fake bicycle parts,

89
0:04:16.98,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and, of course, the counterfeiter's favorite,

90
0:04:19.131,000 --> 0:04:22,000
fake luxury leather goods, clothing and shoes.

91
0:04:23.027,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And what I've learned in the 10 years of investigating fakes

92
0:04:25.925,000 --> 0:04:27,000
is that once you start to scratch the surface,

93
0:04:28.39,000 --> 0:04:3,000
you find that they are rotten to the core,

94
0:04:30.576,000 --> 0:04:34,000
as are the people and organizations that are making money from them,

95
0:04:35.338,000 --> 0:04:38,000
because they are profiting on a massive, massive scale.

96
0:04:39.499,000 --> 0:04:41,000
You can only make around a hundred to 200 percent

97
0:04:41.952,000 --> 0:04:42,000
selling drugs on the street.

98
0:04:43.807,000 --> 0:04:46,000
You can make 2,000 percent selling fakes online

99
0:04:47.674,000 --> 0:04:49,000
with little of the same risks or penalties.

100
0:04:50.856,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And this quick, easy money

101
0:04:52.165,000 --> 0:04:54,000
then goes on to fund the more serious types of crime,

102
0:04:54.833,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and it pays the way to making these organizations,

103
0:04:57.421,000 --> 0:04:59,000
these criminal organizations, look more legitimate.

104
0:05:00.863,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So let me bring you in on a live case.

105
0:05:03.62,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Earlier this year, a series of raids took place

106
0:05:05.843,000 --> 0:05:07,000
in one of my longest-running investigations.

107
0:05:08.47,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Five warehouses were raided in Turkey,

108
0:05:11.547,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and over two million finished counterfeit clothing products were seized,

109
0:05:15.384,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and it took 16 trucks to take that all away.

110
0:05:19.288,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But this gang had been clever.

111
0:05:20.742,000 --> 0:05:23,000
They had gone to the lengths of creating their own fashion brands,

112
0:05:24.154,000 --> 0:05:25,000
complete with registered trademarks,

113
0:05:26.161,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and even having photo shoots on yachts in Italy.

114
0:05:31.124,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And they would use these completely unheard-of and unsuspicious brand names

115
0:05:34.806,000 --> 0:05:36,000
as a way of shipping container loads of fakes

116
0:05:37.472,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to shell companies that they'd set up across Europe.

117
0:05:40.974,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And documents found during those raids

118
0:05:42.87,000 --> 0:05:45,000
found that they'd been falsifying shipping documents

119
0:05:46.268,000 --> 0:05:48,000
so the customs officials would literally have no idea

120
0:05:49.038,000 --> 0:05:51,000
who had sent the products in the first place.

121
0:05:51.944,000 --> 0:05:53,000
When police got access to just one bank account,

122
0:05:54.325,000 --> 0:05:55,000
they found nearly three million euros

123
0:05:56.163,000 --> 0:05:59,000
had been laundered out of Spain in less than two years,

124
0:05:59.632,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and just two days after those raids,

125
0:06:01.735,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that gang were trying to bribe a law firm to get their stock back.

126
0:06:06.782,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Even now, we have no idea where all that money went,

127
0:06:09.87,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to who it went to,

128
0:06:11.06,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but you can bet it's never going to benefit the likes of you or me.

129
0:06:15.97,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But these aren't just low-level street thugs.

130
0:06:18.739,000 --> 0:06:21,000
They're business professionals, and they fly first class.

131
0:06:21.9,000 --> 0:06:22,000
They trick legitimate businesses

132
0:06:23.83,000 --> 0:06:25,000
with convincing fake invoices and paperwork,

133
0:06:26.814,000 --> 0:06:27,000
so everything just seems real,

134
0:06:28.464,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and then they set up eBay and Amazon accounts

135
0:06:31.084,000 --> 0:06:33,000
just to compete with the people they've already sold fakes to.

136
0:06:35.813,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But this isn't just happening online.

137
0:06:38.117,000 --> 0:06:42,000
For a few years, I also used to attend automotive trade shows

138
0:06:42.618,000 --> 0:06:44,000
taking place in huge exhibition spaces,

139
0:06:45.325,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but away from the Ferraris and the Bentleys and the flashing lights,

140
0:06:48.541,000 --> 0:06:49,000
there'd be companies selling fakes:

141
0:06:50.499,000 --> 0:06:52,000
companies with a brochure on the counter

142
0:06:53.214,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and another one underneath, if you ask them the right questions.

143
0:06:56.54,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And they would sell me fake car parts, faulty fake car parts

144
0:06:59.375,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that have been estimated to cause over 36,000 fatalities,

145
0:07:03.916,000 --> 0:07:04,000
deaths on our roads each year.

146
0:07:07.182,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Counterfeiting is set to become a 2.3-trillion-dollar underground economy,

147
0:07:13.095,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and the damage that can be done with that kind of money,

148
0:07:16.174,000 --> 0:07:17,000
it's really frightening ...

149
0:07:18.587,000 --> 0:07:21,000
because fakes fund terror.

150
0:07:21.929,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Fake trainers on the streets of Paris,

151
0:07:24.374,000 --> 0:07:26,000
fake cigarettes in West Africa,

152
0:07:26.841,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and pirate music CDs in the USA

153
0:07:29.08,000 --> 0:07:32,000
have all gone on to fund trips to training camps,

154
0:07:32.358,000 --> 0:07:35,000
bought weapons and ammunition, or the ingredients for explosives.

155
0:07:36.421,000 --> 0:07:39,000
In June 2014, the French security services

156
0:07:39.644,000 --> 0:07:44,000
stopped monitoring the communications of Said and Cherif Kouachi,

157
0:07:45.644,000 --> 0:07:48,000
the two brothers who had been on a terror watch list for three years.

158
0:07:49.548,000 --> 0:07:52,000
But that summer, they were only picking up that Cherif was buying

159
0:07:52.796,000 --> 0:07:54,000
fake trainers from China,

160
0:07:54.879,000 --> 0:07:56,000
so it signaled a shift away from extremism

161
0:07:57.538,000 --> 0:07:59,000
into what was considered a low-level petty crime.

162
0:08:01.752,000 --> 0:08:02,000
The threat had gone away.

163
0:08:04.049,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Seven months later,

164
0:08:05.231,000 --> 0:08:08,000
the two brothers walked into the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine

165
0:08:08.413,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and killed 12 people, wounded 11 more,

166
0:08:11.242,000 --> 0:08:13,000
with guns from the proceeds of those fakes.

167
0:08:14.603,000 --> 0:08:17,000
So whatever you think, this isn't a faraway problem happening in China.

168
0:08:18.259,000 --> 0:08:19,000
It's happening right here.

169
0:08:21.528,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And Paris is not unique.

170
0:08:23.642,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Ten years earlier, in 2004, 191 people lost their lives

171
0:08:27.778,000 --> 0:08:28,000
when a Madrid commuter train was bombed.

172
0:08:30.307,000 --> 0:08:34,000
The attack had been partly funded by the sale of pirate music CDs in the US.

173
0:08:34.88,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Two years prior to that, an Al Qaeda training manual

174
0:08:37.746,000 --> 0:08:39,000
recommended explicitly selling fakes

175
0:08:40.34,000 --> 0:08:42,000
as a good way of supporting terror cells.

176
0:08:44.574,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But despite this, despite the evidence connecting terrorism and counterfeiting,

177
0:08:49.733,000 --> 0:08:51,000
we do go on buying them, increasing the demand

178
0:08:52.527,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to the point where there's even a store in Turkey

179
0:08:54.9,000 --> 0:08:57,000
called "I Love Genuine Fakes."

180
0:08:58.688,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And you have tourists posing with photographs on TripAdvisor,

181
0:09:01.911,000 --> 0:09:02,000
giving it five-star reviews.

182
0:09:04.301,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But would those same tourists have gone into a store

183
0:09:06.76,000 --> 0:09:09,000
called "I Love Genuine Fake Viagra Pills"

184
0:09:10.096,000 --> 0:09:12,000
or "I Genuinely Love Funding Terrorism"?

185
0:09:13.282,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I doubt it.

186
0:09:15.564,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Many of us think that we're completely helpless

187
0:09:18.534,000 --> 0:09:2,000
against organized crime and terrorism,

188
0:09:20.644,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that we can do nothing about the next attack,

189
0:09:23.574,000 --> 0:09:24,000
but I believe you can.

190
0:09:25.755,000 --> 0:09:27,000
You can by becoming investigators, too.

191
0:09:29.875,000 --> 0:09:31,000
The way we cripple these networks is to cut their funding,

192
0:09:32.78,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and that means cutting the demand

193
0:09:34.416,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and changing this idea that it's a victimless crime.

194
0:09:37.197,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Let's all identify counterfeiters,

195
0:09:39.682,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and don't give them our money.

196
0:09:41.736,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So here's a few tips from one investigator to another

197
0:09:44.42,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to get you started.

198
0:09:46.633,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Number one:

199
0:09:47.934,000 --> 0:09:49,000
here's a typical online counterfeiter's website.

200
0:09:51.263,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Note the URL.

201
0:09:52.923,000 --> 0:09:54,000
If you're shopping for sunglasses or camera lenses, say,

202
0:09:55.908,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and you come across a website like medical-insurance-bankruptcy.com,

203
0:09:59.438,000 --> 0:10:,000
start to get very suspicious.

204
0:10:01.027,000 --> 0:10:02,000
(Laughter)

205
0:10:02.577,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Counterfeiters register expired domain names

206
0:10:04.873,000 --> 0:10:07,000
as a way of keeping up the old website's Google page ranking.

207
0:10:09.401,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Number two:

208
0:10:10.576,000 --> 0:10:13,000
is the website screaming at you that everything is 100 percent genuine,

209
0:10:14.083,000 --> 0:10:17,000
but still giving you 75 percent off the latest collection?

210
0:10:18.003,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Look for words like "master copy,"

211
0:10:20.455,000 --> 0:10:22,000
"overruns," "straight from the factory."

212
0:10:23.201,000 --> 0:10:26,000
They could write this all in Comic Sans, it's that much of a joke.

213
0:10:26.345,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Laughter)

214
0:10:27.978,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Number three:

215
0:10:29.236,000 --> 0:10:3,000
if you get as far as the checkout page,

216
0:10:31.136,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and you don't see "https" or a padlock symbol next to the URL,

217
0:10:36.423,000 --> 0:10:38,000
you should really start thinking about closing the tab,

218
0:10:39.059,000 --> 0:10:41,000
because these indicate active security measures

219
0:10:41.361,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that will keep your personal and credit card information safe.

220
0:10:44.49,000 --> 0:10:46,000
OK, last one:

221
0:10:46.607,000 --> 0:10:48,000
go hunting for the "Contact Us" page.

222
0:10:48.835,000 --> 0:10:5,000
If you can only find a generic webform,

223
0:10:51.688,000 --> 0:10:54,000
no company name, telephone number, email address, postal address --

224
0:10:55.637,000 --> 0:10:57,000
that's it, case closed.

225
0:10:57.721,000 --> 0:10:59,000
You found a counterfeiter.

226
0:10:59.992,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Sadly, you're going to have to go back to Google

227
0:11:02.287,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and start your shopping search all over again,

228
0:11:04.455,000 --> 0:11:06,000
but you didn't get ripped off, so that's only a good thing.

229
0:11:08.601,000 --> 0:11:11,000
As the world's most famous fictional detective would say,

230
0:11:12.197,000 --> 0:11:14,000
"Watson, the game is afoot."

231
0:11:15.027,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Only this time, my investigator friends,

232
0:11:17.582,000 --> 0:11:18,000
the game is painfully real.

233
0:11:19.973,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So the next time you're shopping online,

234
0:11:22.099,000 --> 0:11:23,000
or perhaps wherever it is,

235
0:11:24.02,000 --> 0:11:28,000
look closer, question a little bit deeper, and ask yourself --

236
0:11:28.236,000 --> 0:11:3,000
before you hand over the cash or click "Buy,"

237
0:11:31.171,000 --> 0:11:32,000
"Am I sure this is real?"

238
0:11:33.208,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Tell your friend that used to buy counterfeit watches

239
0:11:36.682,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that he may just have brought the next attack one day closer.

240
0:11:40.335,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And, if you see an Instagram advert for fakes,

241
0:11:42.834,000 --> 0:11:43,000
don't keep scrolling past,

242
0:11:44.248,000 --> 0:11:46,000
report it to the platform as a scam.

243
0:11:47.375,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Let's shine a light on the dark forces of counterfeiting

244
0:11:50.461,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that are hiding in plain sight.

245
0:11:52.46,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So please, spread the word

246
0:11:54.549,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and don't stop investigating.

247
0:11:56.385,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Thank you.

248
0:11:57.56,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Applause)

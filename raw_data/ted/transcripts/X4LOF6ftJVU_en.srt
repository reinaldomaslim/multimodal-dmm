1
0:00:12.378,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I came here to show you

2
0:00:14.544,000 --> 0:00:15,000
the Fotokite.

3
0:00:15.829,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It's a tethered, flying camera.

4
0:00:17.931,000 --> 0:00:19,000
But before I do that, I want to tell you a bit about

5
0:00:20.17,000 --> 0:00:22,000
where it came from, what motivated it.

6
0:00:22.344,000 --> 0:00:23,000
So I was born in Russia,

7
0:00:23.839,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and three years ago, in 2011,

8
0:00:26.948,000 --> 0:00:28,000
there were the Russian federal elections.

9
0:00:29.734,000 --> 0:00:31,000
There were massive irregularities reported,

10
0:00:31.819,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and people came out to protest,

11
0:00:33.476,000 --> 0:00:36,000
which was very unlikely for Russia.

12
0:00:37.17,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And no one really knew

13
0:00:38.755,000 --> 0:00:4,000
how significant these protests were,

14
0:00:40.839,000 --> 0:00:41,000
because, for whatever reason,

15
0:00:42.253,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the world media largely ignored it.

16
0:00:44.237,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Now, there was a group of photographers

17
0:00:46.319,000 --> 0:00:49,000
who kind of flew flying cameras as a hobby —

18
0:00:49.637,000 --> 0:00:51,000
usually photographing things like the Sphinx,

19
0:00:52.55,000 --> 0:00:54,000
the Pyramids — who happened to be

20
0:00:55.318,000 --> 0:00:57,000
right around the corner, and they flew a camera

21
0:00:57.973,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and they took some snapshots,

22
0:00:59.749,000 --> 0:01:01,000
some panoramas of this demonstration.

23
0:01:02.326,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Just completely independent entity,

24
0:01:04.159,000 --> 0:01:06,000
completely random occurrence,

25
0:01:06.218,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and the image, when I saw it, it really struck me.

26
0:01:09.886,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Here's one of the panoramas.

27
0:01:11.46,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So in a single image,

28
0:01:12.975,000 --> 0:01:15,000
you can really see the scale of this event —

29
0:01:16.77,000 --> 0:01:19,000
just the number of people,

30
0:01:19.838,000 --> 0:01:21,000
the colors, the banners.

31
0:01:22.525,000 --> 0:01:25,000
You just can't consider this insignificant.

32
0:01:26.366,000 --> 0:01:29,000
All in a single image, which was really cool to me.

33
0:01:29.368,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And I think, in the future,

34
0:01:31.427,000 --> 0:01:33,000
journalism and many other professions,

35
0:01:33.913,000 --> 0:01:35,000
there are flying cameras already quite commonly out there,

36
0:01:36.432,000 --> 0:01:39,000
but I think, you wait a few months, a few years,

37
0:01:39.873,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and for many professions, it's really going to be

38
0:01:41.91,000 --> 0:01:42,000
a requirement.

39
0:01:43.755,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And it make sense. It's such a unique perspective.

40
0:01:45.994,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Nothing really communicates this scale, for example,

41
0:01:49.483,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in context, in a way that this does.

42
0:01:52.507,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But there are a few hurdles, and they are quite basic

43
0:01:54.925,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and quite fundamental.

44
0:01:56.962,000 --> 0:01:57,000
One is piloting.

45
0:01:58.211,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So for this image, they flew a camera,

46
0:02:02.136,000 --> 0:02:06,000
a five kilogram device with an SLR under it.

47
0:02:06.962,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It's quite heavy, lots of spinning, sharp things.

48
0:02:11.438,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It's a bit uncomfortable to fly,

49
0:02:13.868,000 --> 0:02:14,000
probably also for the operator.

50
0:02:15.345,000 --> 0:02:18,000
In fact, you can see that on the back of the pilot's shirt, it says,

51
0:02:18.907,000 --> 0:02:2,000
"No questions until landing"

52
0:02:20.966,000 --> 0:02:21,000
in Russian and in English,

53
0:02:22.85,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because people are curious, and they'll go tap you,

54
0:02:25.224,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and then you lose your focus and things happen.

55
0:02:27.732,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And these guys are great. They're professionals;

56
0:02:29.947,000 --> 0:02:31,000
they're really careful in what they do.

57
0:02:32.94,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So in the protests, maybe you noticed,

58
0:02:35.549,000 --> 0:02:37,000
they flew over the river so it was quite safe.

59
0:02:38.407,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But this doesn't necessarily apply to

60
0:02:41.411,000 --> 0:02:42,000
all people and all conditions,

61
0:02:43.12,000 --> 0:02:45,000
so we really have to make piloting easier.

62
0:02:45.517,000 --> 0:02:47,000
The other problem is regulations,

63
0:02:47.799,000 --> 0:02:5,000
or rather, the lack of good regulation.

64
0:02:50.825,000 --> 0:02:51,000
For many good reasons, it's just difficult

65
0:02:52.738,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to come up with common sense laws

66
0:02:54.86,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to regulate flying cameras.

67
0:02:56.911,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So we already have cameras.

68
0:02:59.239,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Everyone here, I'm sure, has a smartphone with a camera, right?

69
0:03:01.815,000 --> 0:03:02,000
There are more and more of them.

70
0:03:03.447,000 --> 0:03:05,000
You hear about people with Google Glass being attacked.

71
0:03:05.621,000 --> 0:03:07,000
You hear about, actually, a drone pilot,

72
0:03:08.321,000 --> 0:03:09,000
a hobbyist, was attacked two weeks ago

73
0:03:10.222,000 --> 0:03:12,000
because he was flying near a beach.

74
0:03:12.348,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Here's some personal input I didn't expect.

75
0:03:14.575,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Just yesterday, I was attacked by a guy

76
0:03:17.267,000 --> 0:03:19,000
who claimed that I was filming him.

77
0:03:19.818,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I was checking my email right here —

78
0:03:22.517,000 --> 0:03:25,000
easy way to get input for your talk.

79
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But I think there are better solutions.

80
0:03:27.939,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I think we have to defuse the situation.

81
0:03:29.908,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We have to come up with responsible solutions

82
0:03:33.249,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that address the privacy issues

83
0:03:34.926,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and the safety, accountability issues

84
0:03:37.726,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but still give us that perspective.

85
0:03:41.539,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And this is one potential solution.

86
0:03:44.722,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So this is the Fotokite.

87
0:03:47.643,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Well, let me see, it's a quadrocopter,

88
0:03:49.526,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but what's kind of special about it is there's a leash.

89
0:03:53.834,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It's literally a dog leash. It's very convenient.

90
0:03:56.928,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And the neat thing about it is,

91
0:03:59.155,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to fly it, there's no joysticks, nothing like this.

92
0:04:01.539,000 --> 0:04:03,000
You just turn it on

93
0:04:03.877,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and you point in the direction that you want to fly.

94
0:04:06.511,000 --> 0:04:07,000
You give it a little twist.

95
0:04:07.85,000 --> 0:04:1,000
That's kind of the way you communicate.

96
0:04:13.787,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And there it goes.

97
0:04:15.969,000 --> 0:04:17,000
(Applause)

98
0:04:25.396,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So the interaction is super simple.

99
0:04:27.377,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It's like a personal flying pet.

100
0:04:29.333,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It just always maintains a certain angle to you,

101
0:04:31.594,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and if I move around with it,

102
0:04:33.67,000 --> 0:04:35,000
it'll actually follow me naturally.

103
0:04:36.316,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And of course, we can build on top of this.

104
0:04:38.455,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So this leash has some additional electronics.

105
0:04:41.025,000 --> 0:04:42,000
You can turn it on.

106
0:04:42.859,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And now, it's like telling your dog to fly lower,

107
0:04:48.08,000 --> 0:04:5,000
if you have such a dog. So, I can press a button

108
0:04:50.638,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and manipulate it rather easily.

109
0:04:53.281,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So I just shifted its position.

110
0:04:55.97,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And it's really safe.

111
0:04:57.747,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I don't know about you guys in the front row —

112
0:05:00.43,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter) — but at least in principle,

113
0:05:02.674,000 --> 0:05:04,000
you have to agree that you feel safer

114
0:05:04.789,000 --> 0:05:06,000
because there is a physical connection.

115
0:05:06.837,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Live demos are hard, right?

116
0:05:08.355,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Things go wrong all the time.

117
0:05:09.907,000 --> 0:05:1,000
But no matter what,

118
0:05:11.347,000 --> 0:05:12,000
this thing will actually prevent this thing

119
0:05:13.216,000 --> 0:05:14,000
from going into you.

120
0:05:14.882,000 --> 0:05:16,000
What's more, it tells you immediately that

121
0:05:16.97,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I am the one responsible for this device.

122
0:05:18.998,000 --> 0:05:2,000
You don't have to look for someone controlling it.

123
0:05:21.518,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Now, I can tell you that it's easy a lot,

124
0:05:24.285,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but I think a really good way to prove that

125
0:05:27.3,000 --> 0:05:3,000
is to grab a second one

126
0:05:30.359,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and launch it.

127
0:05:34.364,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And if I can do this on stage live,

128
0:05:37.647,000 --> 0:05:39,000
then I can show each and every one of you

129
0:05:39.91,000 --> 0:05:42,000
in five minutes how to operate one of these devices.

130
0:05:52.659,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So now we have two eyes in the sky. (Applause)

131
0:05:54.666,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And now the trick is getting them back.

132
0:05:59.746,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Laughter)

133
0:06:03.841,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So my question now to you is,

134
0:06:06.255,000 --> 0:06:07,000
well, it's a nice solution,

135
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:1,000
it's very accessible, it's safe.

136
0:06:10.13,000 --> 0:06:11,000
What would you use it for?

137
0:06:11.671,000 --> 0:06:14,000
What would you use such a camera for in your life?

138
0:06:15.42,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Thank you.

139
0:06:17.734,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Applause)

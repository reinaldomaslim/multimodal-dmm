1
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Can I say how delighted I am to be away

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
from the calm of Westminster and Whitehall? (Laughter)

3
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
This is Kim, a nine-year-old Vietnam girl,

4
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
her back ruined by napalm,

5
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and she awakened the conscience of the nation of America

6
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to begin to end the Vietnam War.

7
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
This is Birhan, who was the Ethiopian girl

8
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
who launched Live Aid in the 1980s,

9
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
15 minutes away from death when she was rescued,

10
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world.

11
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
This is Tiananmen Square.

12
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
A man before a tank became a picture

13
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance.

14
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
This next is the Sudanese girl,

15
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
a few moments from death,

16
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
a vulture hovering in the background,

17
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
a picture that went round the world

18
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and shocked people into action on poverty.

19
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
This is Neda, the Iranian girl

20
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in Iran

21
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
only a few weeks ago, and she is now the focus, rightly so,

22
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
of the YouTube generation.

23
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And what do all these pictures and events have in common?

24
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
What they have in common is what we see unlocks

25
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
what we cannot see.

26
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
What we see unlocks the invisible ties

27
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and bonds of sympathy that bring us together

28
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
to become a human community.

29
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
What these pictures demonstrate is that

30
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
we do feel the pain of others,

31
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
however distantly.

32
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
What I think these pictures demonstrate

33
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves.

34
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
What these pictures demonstrate is

35
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that there is a moral sense across all religions, across all faiths,

36
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
across all continents -- a moral sense that

37
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
not only do we share the pain of others,

38
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and believe in something bigger than ourselves

39
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
but we have a duty to act when we see things

40
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that are wrong that need righted,

41
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
see injuries that need to be corrected,

42
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
see problems that need to be rectified.

43
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
There is a story about Olof Palme, the Swedish Prime Minister,

44
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
going to see Ronald Reagan in America in the 1980s.

45
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Before he arrived Ronald Reagan said --

46
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and he was the Swedish Social Democratic Prime Minister --

47
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
"Isn’t this man a communist?"

48
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
The reply was, "No, Mr President, he’s an anti-communist."

49
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And Ronald Reagan said, "I don’t care what kind of communist he is!"

50
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Laughter)

51
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Ronald Reagan asked Olof Palme,

52
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden,

53
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
"Well, what do you believe in? Do you want to abolish the rich?"

54
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
He said, "No, I want to abolish the poor."

55
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Our responsibility is to let everyone have the chance

56
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to realize their potential to the full.

57
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic

58
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that commands attention from people of every religion

59
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and every faith, and people of no faith.

60
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But I think what's new is that we now have the capacity

61
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to communicate instantaneously across frontiers

62
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
right across the world.

63
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We now have the capacity to find common ground

64
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
with people who we will never meet,

65
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
but who we will meet through the Internet and through

66
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
all the modern means of communication;

67
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that we now have the capacity to organize

68
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and take collective action together

69
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to deal with the problem or an injustice

70
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that we want to deal with;

71
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history,

72
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and it is the start of what I would call

73
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
the creation of a truly global society.

74
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Go back 200 years when the slave trade was

75
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
under pressure from William Wilberforce and all the protesters.

76
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
They protested across Britain.

77
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
They won public opinion over a long period of time.

78
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful.

79
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
What could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown

80
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
if they were able to use the modern means of communication

81
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
to win people’s hearts and minds?

82
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Or if you take Eglantyne Jebb,

83
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the woman who created Save the Children 90 years ago.

84
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
She was so appalled by what was happening in Austria

85
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
as a result of the First World War and what was happening to children

86
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
who were part of the defeated families of Austria,

87
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that in Britain she wanted to take action,

88
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but she had to go house to house,

89
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
leaflet to leaflet, to get people to attend a rally

90
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
in the Royal Albert Hall

91
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that eventually gave birth to Save the Children,

92
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
an international organization that is now fully recognized

93
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world.

94
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But what more could she have done

95
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
if she’d had the modern means of communications available to her

96
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
to create a sense that the injustice that people saw

97
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
had to be acted upon immediately?

98
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Now look at what’s happened in the last 10 years.

99
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
In Philippines in 2001, President Estrada --

100
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime,

101
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
eventually brought it down and it was, of course, called the "coup de text." (Laughter)

102
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Then you have in Zimbabwe the first election under Robert Mugabe a year ago.

103
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Because people were able to take mobile phone photographs

104
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
of what was happening at the polling stations, it was impossible

105
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
for that Premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do.

106
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Or take Burma and the monks that were blogging out,

107
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
a country that nobody knew anything about that was happening, until these blogs

108
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
told the world that there was a repression,

109
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
meaning that lives were being lost

110
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and people were being persecuted and Aung San Suu Kyi,

111
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
who is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world,

112
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
had to be listened to.

113
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Then take Iran itself, and what people are doing today:

114
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
following what happened to Neda,

115
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
people who are preventing the security services of Iran finding those people

116
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
who are blogging out of Iran, any by everybody who is blogging,

117
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
changing their address to Tehran, Iran,

118
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and making it difficult for the security services.

119
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Take, therefore, what modern technology is capable of:

120
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications

121
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and our ability to organize internationally.

122
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
That, in my view, gives us the first opportunity as a community

123
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to fundamentally change the world.

124
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Foreign policy can never be the same again. It cannot be run by elites;

125
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
it’s got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging,

126
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
who are communicating with each other around the world.

127
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery.

128
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
150 years ago I suppose the main problem in a country like ours

129
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
was how young people, children, had the right to education.

130
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
100 years ago in most countries in Europe, the pressure was for the right to vote.

131
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
50 years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare.

132
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
In the last 50-60 years we have seen fascism, anti-Semitism, racism, apartheid,

133
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality;

134
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
all these have come under pressure

135
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world.

136
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I was with Nelson Mandela a year ago, when he was in London.

137
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday

138
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and for the creation of new resources for his foundation.

139
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I was sitting next to Nelson Mandela -- I was very privileged to do so --

140
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
when Amy Winehouse came onto the stage. (Laughter)

141
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And Nelson Mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer

142
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and I was explaining to him at the time who she was.

143
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Amy Winehouse said, "Nelson Mandela and I have a lot in common.

144
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
My husband too has spent a long time in prison."

145
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Laughter)

146
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Nelson Mandela then went down to the stage

147
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and he summarized the challenge for us all.

148
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
He said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain, the mountain

149
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid.

150
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
He said that there was a greater challenge ahead,

151
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
the challenge of poverty, of climate change -- global challenges

152
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that needed global solutions

153
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and needed the creation of a truly global society.

154
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
We are the first generation which is in a position to do this.

155
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Combine the power of a global ethic

156
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
with the power of our ability to communicate

157
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and organize globally, with the challenges that we now face,

158
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
most of which are global in their nature.

159
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Climate change cannot be solved in one country,

160
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
but has got to be solved by the world working together.

161
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
A financial crisis, just as we have seen, could not be solved

162
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
by America alone or Europe alone;

163
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
it needed the world to work together.

164
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Take the problems of security and terrorism and, equally,

165
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
the problem of human rights and development:

166
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
they cannot be solved by Africa alone;

167
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
they cannot be solved by America or Europe alone.

168
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
We cannot solve these problems unless we work together.

169
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So the great project of our generation, it seems to me,

170
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
is to build for the first time, out of a global ethic

171
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and our global ability to communicate

172
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and organize together, a truly global society,

173
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
built on that ethic but with institutions

174
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
that can serve that global society and make for a different future.

175
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We have now, and are the first generation with, the power to do this.

176
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Take climate change. Is it not absolutely scandalous

177
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that we have a situation

178
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
where we know that there is a climate change problem,

179
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources

180
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
to the poorest countries to deal with that,

181
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
when we want to create a global carbon market,

182
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
but there is no global institution

183
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that people have been able to agree upon

184
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
to deal with this problem?

185
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
One of the things that has got to come out of Copenhagen in the next few months

186
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
is an agreement that there will be

187
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
a global environmental institution

188
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that is able to deal

189
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
with the problems of persuading the whole of the world

190
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to move along a climate-change agenda.

191
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Applause)

192
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
One of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough

193
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
is that we have got to persuade people around the world

194
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
to change their behavior as well,

195
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility

196
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
across the generations.

197
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Take the financial crisis.

198
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
If people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in New York

199
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
or starts in the sub-prime market of the United States of America.

200
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
If people can find that that sub-prime product

201
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
has been transferred across nations

202
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
many, many times until it ends up in banks in Iceland

203
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
or the rest in Britain,

204
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and people's ordinary savings are affected by it,

205
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision.

206
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
You need in the long run for stability, for economic growth,

207
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
for jobs, as well as for financial stability,

208
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
global economic institutions that make sure

209
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that growth to be sustained has to be shared,

210
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and are built on the principle

211
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
that the prosperity of this world is indivisible.

212
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
So another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions

213
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility,

214
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
not the ideas that were the basis

215
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
of the last stage of financial development over these recent years.

216
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Then take development and take the partnership we need between our countries

217
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and the rest of the world, the poorest part of the world.

218
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
We do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future,

219
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and yet, out of people’s desire for a global ethic

220
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and a global society that can be done.

221
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone.

222
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
This is a country of six and a half million people,

223
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
but it has only 80 doctors; it has 200 nurses;

224
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
it has 120 midwives.

225
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
You cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people

226
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
with such limited resources.

227
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Or take the girl I met when I was in Tanzania,

228
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
a girl called Miriam.

229
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
She was 11 years old; her parents had both died from AIDS,

230
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
her mother and then her father.

231
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
She was an AIDS orphan being handed

232
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
across different extended families to be cared for.

233
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
She herself was suffering from HIV;

234
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
she was suffering from tuberculosis.

235
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
I met her in a field, she was ragged, she had no shoes.

236
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
When you looked in her eyes, any girl at the age of eleven

237
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
is looking forward to the future,

238
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl’s eyes

239
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and if I could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment,

240
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
I believe that all the work that it had done for the global HIV/AIDS fund

241
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations.

242
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
We must then build a proper relationship between the richest and

243
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
the poorest countries

244
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves

245
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture,

246
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
so that Africa is not a net importer of food, but an exporter of food.

247
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Take the problems of human rights and

248
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
the problems of security in so many countries around the world.

249
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Burma is in chains, Zimbabwe is a human tragedy,

250
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
in Sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily

251
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
for wars that we could prevent.

252
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
In the Rwanda Children's Museum,

253
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
there is a photograph of a 10-year-old boy

254
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and the Children's Museum is commemorating the lives that were lost

255
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
in the Rwandan genocide where a million people died.

256
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
There is a photograph of a boy called David.

257
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Beside that photograph there is the information about his life.

258
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
It said "David, age 10."

259
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
David: ambition to be a doctor.

260
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Favorite sport: football. What did he enjoy most?

261
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Making people laugh.

262
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
How did he die?

263
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Tortured to death.

264
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death:

265
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
"Don't worry. The United Nations are coming."

266
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And we never did.

267
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And that young boy believed our promises

268
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
that we would help people in difficulty in Rwanda,

269
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and we never did.

270
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
So we have got to create in this world also

271
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid,

272
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
but also for reconstruction and security

273
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
for some of the conflict-ridden states of the world.

274
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
So my argument today is basically this.

275
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
We have the means by which we could create a truly global society.

276
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
The institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors.

277
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
That global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary

278
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
for these institutions to work,

279
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
but we should not lose the chance in this generation,

280
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
in this decade in particular, with President Obama in America,

281
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
with other people working with us around the world,

282
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
to create global institutions for the environment,

283
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and for finance,

284
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and for security and for development,

285
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples,

286
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
our desire to bind the world together, and

287
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist.

288
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
It is said that in Ancient Rome that when Cicero spoke to his audiences,

289
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
people used to turn to each other and say about Cicero, "Great speech."

290
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
But it is said that in Ancient Greece

291
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
when Demosthenes spoke to his audiences,

292
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
people turned to each other and didn’t say "Great speech."

293
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
They said, "Let's march."

294
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
We should be marching towards a global society.

295
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Thank you.

296
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
(Applause)

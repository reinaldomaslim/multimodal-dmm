1
0:00:14.28,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Before I get to bulk of what I have to say,

2
0:00:17.353,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I feel compelled just to mention a couple of things about myself.

3
0:00:21.564,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I am not some mystical,

4
0:00:24.637,000 --> 0:00:25,000
spiritual sort of person.

5
0:00:27.488,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'm a science writer.

6
0:00:29.54,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I studied physics in college.

7
0:00:31.835,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I used to be a science correspondent for NPR.

8
0:00:35.893,000 --> 0:00:36,000
OK, that said:

9
0:00:38.372,000 --> 0:00:41,000
in the course of working on a story for NPR,

10
0:00:41.635,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I got some advice from an astronomer

11
0:00:43.937,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that challenged my outlook,

12
0:00:46.068,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and frankly, changed my life.

13
0:00:49.012,000 --> 0:00:51,000
You see, the story was about an eclipse,

14
0:00:51.228,000 --> 0:00:55,000
a partial solar eclipse that was set to cross the country

15
0:00:55.796,000 --> 0:00:56,000
in May of 1994.

16
0:00:58.171,000 --> 0:01:,000
And the astronomer -- I interviewed him,

17
0:01:00.659,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and he explained what was going to happen and how to view it,

18
0:01:03.96,000 --> 0:01:08,000
but he emphasized that, as interesting as a partial solar eclipse is,

19
0:01:09.205,000 --> 0:01:13,000
a much rarer total solar eclipse is completely different.

20
0:01:14.319,000 --> 0:01:17,000
In a total eclipse, for all of two or three minutes,

21
0:01:17.617,000 --> 0:01:2,000
the moon completely blocks the face of the sun,

22
0:01:20.972,000 --> 0:01:25,000
creating what he described as the most awe-inspiring spectacle

23
0:01:26.236,000 --> 0:01:27,000
in all of nature.

24
0:01:28.58,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And so the advice he gave me was this:

25
0:01:31.907,000 --> 0:01:33,000
"Before you die," he said,

26
0:01:34.928,000 --> 0:01:38,000
"you owe it to yourself to experience a total solar eclipse."

27
0:01:39.925,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Well honestly, I felt a little uncomfortable

28
0:01:42.43,000 --> 0:01:44,000
hearing that from someone I didn't know very well;

29
0:01:44.862,000 --> 0:01:45,000
it felt sort of intimate.

30
0:01:46.277,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But it got my attention, and so I did some research.

31
0:01:50.825,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Now the thing about total eclipses is,

32
0:01:52.896,000 --> 0:01:54,000
if you wait for one to come to you,

33
0:01:55.306,000 --> 0:01:58,000
you're going to be waiting a long time.

34
0:01:58.722,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Any given point on earth experiences a total eclipse

35
0:02:03.266,000 --> 0:02:06,000
about once every 400 years.

36
0:02:07.244,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But if you're willing to travel, you don't have to wait that long.

37
0:02:10.77,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And so I learned that a few years later, in 1998,

38
0:02:15.111,000 --> 0:02:17,000
a total eclipse was going to cross the Caribbean.

39
0:02:19.021,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Now, a total eclipse is visible only along a narrow path,

40
0:02:22.574,000 --> 0:02:23,000
about a hundred miles wide,

41
0:02:24.278,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and that's where the moon's shadow falls.

42
0:02:26.396,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It's called the "path of totality."

43
0:02:28.551,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And in February 1998,

44
0:02:30.998,000 --> 0:02:33,000
the path of totality was going to cross Aruba.

45
0:02:34.469,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So I talked to my husband, and we thought: February? Aruba?

46
0:02:38.809,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Sounded like a good idea anyway.

47
0:02:40.552,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:41.648,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So we headed south,

49
0:02:44.307,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to enjoy the sun and to see what would happen

50
0:02:46.803,000 --> 0:02:47,000
when the sun briefly went away.

51
0:02:49.356,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Well, the day of the eclipse found us and many other people

52
0:02:52.371,000 --> 0:02:54,000
out behind the Hyatt Regency,

53
0:02:54.576,000 --> 0:02:55,000
on the beach,

54
0:02:55.763,000 --> 0:02:56,000
waiting for the show to begin.

55
0:02:57.498,000 --> 0:03:,000
And we wore eclipse glasses with cardboard frames

56
0:03:00.693,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and really dark lenses that enabled us to look at the sun safely.

57
0:03:05.787,000 --> 0:03:09,000
A total eclipse begins as a partial eclipse,

58
0:03:10.046,000 --> 0:03:13,000
as the moon very slowly makes its way in front of the sun.

59
0:03:13.846,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So first it looked the sun had a little notch in its edge,

60
0:03:18.098,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and then that notch grew larger and larger,

61
0:03:21.243,000 --> 0:03:22,000
turning the sun into a crescent.

62
0:03:24.064,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And it was all very interesting, but I wouldn't say it was spectacular.

63
0:03:27.423,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I mean, the day remained bright.

64
0:03:29.371,000 --> 0:03:32,000
If I hadn't known what was going on overhead,

65
0:03:32.405,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I wouldn't have noticed anything unusual.

66
0:03:35.872,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Well, about 10 minutes before the total solar eclipse was set to begin,

67
0:03:40.706,000 --> 0:03:41,000
weird things started to happen.

68
0:03:43.754,000 --> 0:03:44,000
A cool wind kicked up.

69
0:03:46.628,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Daylight looked odd, and shadows became very strange;

70
0:03:50.565,000 --> 0:03:52,000
they looked bizarrely sharp,

71
0:03:52.823,000 --> 0:03:55,000
as if someone had turned up the contrast knob on the TV.

72
0:03:57.587,000 --> 0:04:,000
Then I looked offshore, and I noticed running lights on boats,

73
0:04:01.478,000 --> 0:04:03,000
so clearly it was getting dark,

74
0:04:04.065,000 --> 0:04:05,000
although I hadn't realized it.

75
0:04:05.675,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Well soon, it was obvious it was getting dark.

76
0:04:07.972,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It felt like my eyesight was failing.

77
0:04:11.006,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And then all of a sudden,

78
0:04:12.804,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the lights went out.

79
0:04:15.65,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Well, at that,

80
0:04:17.312,000 --> 0:04:19,000
a cheer erupted from the beach,

81
0:04:19.953,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and I took off my eclipse glasses,

82
0:04:21.87,000 --> 0:04:23,000
because at this point during the total eclipse,

83
0:04:24.485,000 --> 0:04:27,000
it was safe to look at the sun with the naked eye.

84
0:04:28.185,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And I glanced upward,

85
0:04:31.826,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and I was just dumbstruck.

86
0:04:37.361,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Now, consider that, at this point, I was in my mid-30s.

87
0:04:42.122,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I had lived on earth long enough to know what the sky looks like.

88
0:04:49.489,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I mean --

89
0:04:50.664,000 --> 0:04:51,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:51.77,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I'd seen blue skies and grey skies

91
0:04:54.888,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and starry skies and angry skies

92
0:04:58.853,000 --> 0:05:,000
and pink skies at sunrise.

93
0:05:01.702,000 --> 0:05:04,000
But here was a sky I had never seen.

94
0:05:06.137,000 --> 0:05:08,000
First, there were the colors.

95
0:05:08.437,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Up above, it was a deep purple-grey,

96
0:05:11.426,000 --> 0:05:12,000
like twilight.

97
0:05:12.863,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But on the horizon it was orange,

98
0:05:14.597,000 --> 0:05:15,000
like sunset,

99
0:05:15.922,000 --> 0:05:16,000
360 degrees.

100
0:05:18.246,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And up above, in the twilight,

101
0:05:20.912,000 --> 0:05:22,000
bright stars and planets had come out.

102
0:05:23.361,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So there was Jupiter

103
0:05:24.987,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and there was Mercury

104
0:05:26.747,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and there was Venus.

105
0:05:28.91,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They were all in a line.

106
0:05:32.348,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And there, along this line,

107
0:05:36.108,000 --> 0:05:38,000
was this thing,

108
0:05:38.598,000 --> 0:05:41,000
this glorious, bewildering thing.

109
0:05:42.146,000 --> 0:05:46,000
It looked like a wreath woven from silvery thread,

110
0:05:46.921,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and it just hung out there in space, shimmering.

111
0:05:52.322,000 --> 0:05:55,000
That was the sun's outer atmosphere,

112
0:05:55.986,000 --> 0:05:56,000
the solar corona.

113
0:05:57.819,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And pictures just don't do it justice.

114
0:06:00.202,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It's not just a ring or halo around the sun;

115
0:06:04.759,000 --> 0:06:07,000
it's finely textured, like it's made out of strands of silk.

116
0:06:09.583,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And although it looked nothing like our sun,

117
0:06:12.108,000 --> 0:06:14,000
of course, I knew that's what it was.

118
0:06:14.386,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So there was the sun, and there were the planets,

119
0:06:18.242,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and I could see how the planets revolve around the sun.

120
0:06:22.297,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It's like I had left our solar system

121
0:06:25.106,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and was standing on some alien world,

122
0:06:27.726,000 --> 0:06:28,000
looking back at creation.

123
0:06:30.599,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And for the first time in my life,

124
0:06:33.014,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I just felt viscerally connected to the universe

125
0:06:37.06,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in all of its immensity.

126
0:06:39.927,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Time stopped,

127
0:06:42.207,000 --> 0:06:44,000
or it just kind of felt nonexistent,

128
0:06:44.779,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and what I beheld with my eyes --

129
0:06:47.887,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I didn't just see it,

130
0:06:50.255,000 --> 0:06:51,000
it felt like a vision.

131
0:06:53.678,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And I stood there in this nirvana

132
0:06:57.35,000 --> 0:07:02,000
for all of 174 seconds -- less than three minutes --

133
0:07:03.01,000 --> 0:07:05,000
when all of a sudden, it was over.

134
0:07:05.417,000 --> 0:07:06,000
The sun burst out,

135
0:07:06.792,000 --> 0:07:07,000
the blue sky returned,

136
0:07:08.478,000 --> 0:07:11,000
the stars and the planets and the corona were gone.

137
0:07:11.679,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The world returned to normal.

138
0:07:14.393,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But I had changed.

139
0:07:17.439,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And that's how I became an umbraphile --

140
0:07:21.401,000 --> 0:07:22,000
an eclipse chaser.

141
0:07:22.591,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

142
0:07:23.624,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So, this is how I spend my time and hard-earned money.

143
0:07:28.818,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Every couple of years, I head off to wherever the moon's shadow will fall

144
0:07:34.471,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to experience another couple minutes

145
0:07:36.885,000 --> 0:07:37,000
of cosmic bliss,

146
0:07:38.369,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and to share the experience with others:

147
0:07:40.68,000 --> 0:07:42,000
with friends in Australia,

148
0:07:42.711,000 --> 0:07:44,000
with an entire city in Germany.

149
0:07:45.288,000 --> 0:07:49,000
In 1999, in Munich, I joined hundreds of thousands

150
0:07:49.65,000 --> 0:07:53,000
who filled the streets and the rooftops and cheered in unison

151
0:07:54.435,000 --> 0:07:55,000
as the solar corona emerged.

152
0:07:57.539,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And over time, I've become something else:

153
0:08:00.318,000 --> 0:08:02,000
an eclipse evangelist.

154
0:08:02.936,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I see it as my job

155
0:08:05.557,000 --> 0:08:09,000
to pay forward the advice that I received all those years ago.

156
0:08:11.189,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And so let me tell you:

157
0:08:14.35,000 --> 0:08:16,000
before you die,

158
0:08:16.607,000 --> 0:08:2,000
you owe it to yourself to experience a total solar eclipse.

159
0:08:21.609,000 --> 0:08:24,000
It is the ultimate experience of awe.

160
0:08:26.601,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Now, that word, "awesome," has grown so overused

161
0:08:31.208,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that it's lost its original meaning.

162
0:08:33.396,000 --> 0:08:37,000
True awe, a sense of wonder and insignificance

163
0:08:37.899,000 --> 0:08:39,000
in the face of something enormous and grand,

164
0:08:40.454,000 --> 0:08:41,000
is rare in our lives.

165
0:08:42.469,000 --> 0:08:45,000
But when you experience it, it's powerful.

166
0:08:46.304,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Awe dissolves the ego.

167
0:08:48.683,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It makes us feel connected.

168
0:08:50.701,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Indeed, it promotes empathy and generosity.

169
0:08:54.74,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Well, there is nothing truly more awesome than a total solar eclipse.

170
0:09:00.317,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Unfortunately, few Americans have seen one,

171
0:09:02.726,000 --> 0:09:04,000
because it's been 38 years

172
0:09:04.97,000 --> 0:09:07,000
since one last touched the continental United States

173
0:09:08.164,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and 99 years since one last crossed the breadth of the nation.

174
0:09:12.976,000 --> 0:09:14,000
But that is about to change.

175
0:09:15.567,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Over the next 35 years,

176
0:09:18.674,000 --> 0:09:22,000
five total solar eclipses will visit the continental United States,

177
0:09:22.982,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and three of them will be especially grand.

178
0:09:26.966,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Six weeks from now, on August 21, 2017 --

179
0:09:31.664,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(Applause)

180
0:09:34.367,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the moon's shadow will race from Oregon to South Carolina.

181
0:09:39.116,000 --> 0:09:44,000
April 8, 2024, the moon's shadow heads north from Texas to Maine.

182
0:09:44.543,000 --> 0:09:46,000
In 2045, on August 12,

183
0:09:46.739,000 --> 0:09:48,000
the path cuts from California to Florida.

184
0:09:51.278,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I say:

185
0:09:53.493,000 --> 0:09:55,000
What if we made these holidays?

186
0:09:56.108,000 --> 0:09:57,000
What if we --

187
0:09:57.338,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Laughter)

188
0:09:58.39,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Applause)

189
0:10:02.096,000 --> 0:10:07,000
What if we all stood together,

190
0:10:07.177,000 --> 0:10:09,000
as many people as possible,

191
0:10:09.277,000 --> 0:10:1,000
in the shadow of the moon?

192
0:10:11.073,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Just maybe, this shared experience of awe would help heal our divisions,

193
0:10:16.937,000 --> 0:10:18,000
get us to treat each other just a bit more humanely.

194
0:10:20.738,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Now, admittedly, some folks consider my evangelizing a little out there;

195
0:10:26.588,000 --> 0:10:28,000
my obsession, eccentric.

196
0:10:29.812,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I mean, why focus so much attention on something so brief?

197
0:10:34.716,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Why cross the globe -- or state lines, for that matter --

198
0:10:38.442,000 --> 0:10:41,000
for something that lasts three minutes?

199
0:10:42.985,000 --> 0:10:43,000
As I said:

200
0:10:44.726,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I am not a spiritual person.

201
0:10:47.826,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I don't believe in God.

202
0:10:50.421,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I wish I did.

203
0:10:52.712,000 --> 0:10:54,000
But when I think of my own mortality --

204
0:10:55.693,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and I do, a lot --

205
0:10:58.791,000 --> 0:11:01,000
when I think of everyone I have lost,

206
0:11:02.395,000 --> 0:11:03,000
my mother in particular,

207
0:11:05.598,000 --> 0:11:06,000
what soothes me

208
0:11:07.422,000 --> 0:11:1,000
is that moment of awe I had in Aruba.

209
0:11:11.416,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I picture myself on that beach,

210
0:11:14.556,000 --> 0:11:15,000
looking at that sky,

211
0:11:16.857,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and I remember how I felt.

212
0:11:20.481,000 --> 0:11:22,000
My existence may be temporary,

213
0:11:23.798,000 --> 0:11:25,000
but that's OK because, my gosh,

214
0:11:26.329,000 --> 0:11:28,000
look at what I'm a part of.

215
0:11:30.034,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And so this is a lesson I've learned,

216
0:11:32.187,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and it's one that applies to life in general:

217
0:11:35.62,000 --> 0:11:39,000
duration of experience does not equal impact.

218
0:11:40.049,000 --> 0:11:44,000
One weekend, one conversation -- hell, one glance --

219
0:11:45.253,000 --> 0:11:46,000
can change everything.

220
0:11:48.328,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Cherish those moments of deep connection with other people,

221
0:11:51.838,000 --> 0:11:52,000
with the natural world,

222
0:11:53.273,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and make them a priority.

223
0:11:55.036,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Yes, I chase eclipses.

224
0:11:57.474,000 --> 0:11:59,000
You might chase something else.

225
0:11:59.515,000 --> 0:12:02,000
But it's not about the 174 seconds.

226
0:12:04.132,000 --> 0:12:06,000
It's about how they change

227
0:12:06.844,000 --> 0:12:07,000
the years that come after.

228
0:12:08.934,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Thank you.

229
0:12:10.128,000 --> 0:12:14,000
(Applause)

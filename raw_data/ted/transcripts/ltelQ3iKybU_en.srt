2
0:00:15.772,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'd like to tell you about two games of chess.

3
0:00:18.328,000 --> 0:00:21,000
The first happened in 1997, in which Garry Kasparov,

4
0:00:22.192,000 --> 0:00:25,000
a human, lost to Deep Blue, a machine.

5
0:00:25.908,000 --> 0:00:27,000
To many, this was the dawn of a new era,

6
0:00:28.148,000 --> 0:00:3,000
one where man would be dominated by machine.

7
0:00:30.927,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But here we are, 20 years on, and the greatest change

8
0:00:34.261,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in how we relate to computers is the iPad,

9
0:00:36.951,000 --> 0:00:38,000
not HAL.

10
0:00:38.996,000 --> 0:00:4,000
The second game was a freestyle chess tournament

11
0:00:41.644,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in 2005, in which man and machine could enter together

12
0:00:44.613,000 --> 0:00:48,000
as partners, rather than adversaries, if they so chose.

13
0:00:49.279,000 --> 0:00:5,000
At first, the results were predictable.

14
0:00:51.13,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Even a supercomputer was beaten by a grandmaster

15
0:00:53.627,000 --> 0:00:55,000
with a relatively weak laptop.

16
0:00:55.939,000 --> 0:00:57,000
The surprise came at the end. Who won?

17
0:00:58.924,000 --> 0:01:,000
Not a grandmaster with a supercomputer,

18
0:01:01.7,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but actually two American amateurs

19
0:01:03.193,000 --> 0:01:06,000
using three relatively weak laptops.

20
0:01:07.015,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Their ability to coach and manipulate their computers

21
0:01:09.611,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to deeply explore specific positions

22
0:01:12.046,000 --> 0:01:14,000
effectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge

23
0:01:14.436,000 --> 0:01:16,000
of the grandmasters and the superior computational power

24
0:01:17.045,000 --> 0:01:18,000
of other adversaries.

25
0:01:18.954,000 --> 0:01:2,000
This is an astonishing result: average men,

26
0:01:21.859,000 --> 0:01:25,000
average machines beating the best man, the best machine.

27
0:01:25.94,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And anyways, isn't it supposed to be man versus machine?

28
0:01:29.139,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Instead, it's about cooperation, and the right type of cooperation.

29
0:01:33.291,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We've been paying a lot of attention to Marvin Minsky's

30
0:01:36.148,000 --> 0:01:39,000
vision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years.

31
0:01:39.39,000 --> 0:01:41,000
It's a sexy vision, for sure. Many have embraced it.

32
0:01:41.652,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It's become the dominant school of thought in computer science.

33
0:01:44.405,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But as we enter the era of big data, of network systems,

34
0:01:47.477,000 --> 0:01:49,000
of open platforms, and embedded technology,

35
0:01:50.175,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I'd like to suggest it's time to reevaluate an alternative vision

36
0:01:53.567,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that was actually developed around the same time.

37
0:01:56.637,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I'm talking about J.C.R. Licklider's human-computer symbiosis,

38
0:01:59.969,000 --> 0:02:02,000
perhaps better termed "intelligence augmentation," I.A.

39
0:02:03.777,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Licklider was a computer science titan who had a profound

40
0:02:06.417,000 --> 0:02:09,000
effect on the development of technology and the Internet.

41
0:02:09.423,000 --> 0:02:11,000
His vision was to enable man and machine to cooperate

42
0:02:12.291,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in making decisions, controlling complex situations

43
0:02:15.881,000 --> 0:02:16,000
without the inflexible dependence

44
0:02:17.651,000 --> 0:02:19,000
on predetermined programs.

45
0:02:20.184,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Note that word "cooperate."

46
0:02:22.682,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Licklider encourages us not to take a toaster

47
0:02:25.429,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and make it Data from "Star Trek,"

48
0:02:27.713,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but to take a human and make her more capable.

49
0:02:31.248,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Humans are so amazing -- how we think,

50
0:02:33.159,000 --> 0:02:35,000
our non-linear approaches, our creativity,

51
0:02:35.777,000 --> 0:02:37,000
iterative hypotheses, all very difficult if possible at all

52
0:02:37.908,000 --> 0:02:38,000
for computers to do.

53
0:02:39.253,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Licklider intuitively realized this, contemplating humans

54
0:02:41.705,000 --> 0:02:43,000
setting the goals, formulating the hypotheses,

55
0:02:44.032,000 --> 0:02:47,000
determining the criteria, and performing the evaluation.

56
0:02:47.408,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Of course, in other ways, humans are so limited.

57
0:02:49.183,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We're terrible at scale, computation and volume.

58
0:02:52.418,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We require high-end talent management

59
0:02:54.254,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to keep the rock band together and playing.

60
0:02:56.318,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Licklider foresaw computers doing all the routinizable work

61
0:02:58.522,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making.

62
0:03:01.798,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Silently, without much fanfare,

63
0:03:04.022,000 --> 0:03:07,000
this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess.

64
0:03:07.376,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Protein folding, a topic that shares the incredible expansiveness of chess —

65
0:03:10.732,000 --> 0:03:13,000
there are more ways of folding a protein than there are atoms in the universe.

66
0:03:13.774,000 --> 0:03:15,000
This is a world-changing problem with huge implications

67
0:03:16.127,000 --> 0:03:18,000
for our ability to understand and treat disease.

68
0:03:18.435,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And for this task, supercomputer field brute force simply isn't enough.

69
0:03:22.683,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Foldit, a game created by computer scientists,

70
0:03:25.067,000 --> 0:03:27,000
illustrates the value of the approach.

71
0:03:27.569,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Non-technical, non-biologist amateurs play a video game

72
0:03:30.61,000 --> 0:03:33,000
in which they visually rearrange the structure of the protein,

73
0:03:33.683,000 --> 0:03:34,000
allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces

74
0:03:35.182,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and interactions and identify structural issues.

75
0:03:38.139,000 --> 0:03:41,000
This approach beat supercomputers 50 percent of the time

76
0:03:41.162,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and tied 30 percent of the time.

77
0:03:43.746,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Foldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery

78
0:03:46.883,000 --> 0:03:49,000
by deciphering the structure of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus.

79
0:03:50.043,000 --> 0:03:53,000
A protease that had eluded determination for over 10 years

80
0:03:53.058,000 --> 0:03:55,000
was solved was by three players in a matter of days,

81
0:03:55.684,000 --> 0:03:57,000
perhaps the first major scientific advance

82
0:03:57.709,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to come from playing a video game.

83
0:04:00.032,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Last year, on the site of the Twin Towers,

84
0:04:02.213,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the 9/11 memorial opened.

85
0:04:03.686,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It displays the names of the thousands of victims

86
0:04:06.407,000 --> 0:04:09,000
using a beautiful concept called "meaningful adjacency."

87
0:04:09.47,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It places the names next to each other based on their

88
0:04:11.636,000 --> 0:04:13,000
relationships to one another: friends, families, coworkers.

89
0:04:13.849,000 --> 0:04:16,000
When you put it all together, it's quite a computational

90
0:04:16.877,000 --> 0:04:2,000
challenge: 3,500 victims, 1,800 adjacency requests,

91
0:04:21.1,000 --> 0:04:24,000
the importance of the overall physical specifications

92
0:04:24.192,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and the final aesthetics.

93
0:04:26.329,000 --> 0:04:28,000
When first reported by the media, full credit for such a feat

94
0:04:28.944,000 --> 0:04:29,000
was given to an algorithm from the New York City

95
0:04:30.836,000 --> 0:04:34,000
design firm Local Projects. The truth is a bit more nuanced.

96
0:04:34.837,000 --> 0:04:36,000
While an algorithm was used to develop the underlying framework,

97
0:04:37.708,000 --> 0:04:4,000
humans used that framework to design the final result.

98
0:04:40.716,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So in this case, a computer had evaluated millions

99
0:04:42.941,000 --> 0:04:45,000
of possible layouts, managed a complex relational system,

100
0:04:46.276,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and kept track of a very large set of measurements

101
0:04:48.69,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and variables, allowing the humans to focus

102
0:04:51.1,000 --> 0:04:53,000
on design and compositional choices.

103
0:04:53.902,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So the more you look around you,

104
0:04:54.938,000 --> 0:04:55,000
the more you see Licklider's vision everywhere.

105
0:04:56.9,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Whether it's augmented reality in your iPhone or GPS in your car,

106
0:05:00.204,000 --> 0:05:02,000
human-computer symbiosis is making us more capable.

107
0:05:03.174,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So if you want to improve human-computer symbiosis,

108
0:05:04.829,000 --> 0:05:05,000
what can you do?

109
0:05:06.258,000 --> 0:05:08,000
You can start by designing the human into the process.

110
0:05:08.71,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem,

111
0:05:10.914,000 --> 0:05:13,000
design the solution around what the human will do as well.

112
0:05:14.783,000 --> 0:05:15,000
When you do this, you'll quickly realize that you spent

113
0:05:16.72,000 --> 0:05:18,000
all of your time on the interface between man and machine,

114
0:05:19.599,000 --> 0:05:22,000
specifically on designing away the friction in the interaction.

115
0:05:22.698,000 --> 0:05:24,000
In fact, this friction is more important than the power

116
0:05:25.464,000 --> 0:05:27,000
of the man or the power of the machine

117
0:05:27.516,000 --> 0:05:28,000
in determining overall capability.

118
0:05:29.447,000 --> 0:05:3,000
That's why two amateurs with a few laptops

119
0:05:31.424,000 --> 0:05:33,000
handily beat a supercomputer and a grandmaster.

120
0:05:33.88,000 --> 0:05:36,000
What Kasparov calls process is a byproduct of friction.

121
0:05:36.885,000 --> 0:05:38,000
The better the process, the less the friction.

122
0:05:39.286,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And minimizing friction turns out to be the decisive variable.

123
0:05:43.542,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Or take another example: big data.

124
0:05:45.785,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Every interaction we have in the world is recorded

125
0:05:47.691,000 --> 0:05:5,000
by an ever growing array of sensors: your phone,

126
0:05:50.75,000 --> 0:05:52,000
your credit card, your computer. The result is big data,

127
0:05:53.123,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and it actually presents us with an opportunity

128
0:05:54.865,000 --> 0:05:56,000
to more deeply understand the human condition.

129
0:05:57.527,000 --> 0:05:59,000
The major emphasis of most approaches to big data

130
0:05:59.832,000 --> 0:06:01,000
focus on, "How do I store this data? How do I search

131
0:06:02.047,000 --> 0:06:04,000
this data? How do I process this data?"

132
0:06:04.323,000 --> 0:06:06,000
These are necessary but insufficient questions.

133
0:06:06.527,000 --> 0:06:08,000
The imperative is not to figure out how to compute,

134
0:06:08.998,000 --> 0:06:1,000
but what to compute. How do you impose human intuition

135
0:06:11.182,000 --> 0:06:12,000
on data at this scale?

136
0:06:12.973,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Again, we start by designing the human into the process.

137
0:06:16.472,000 --> 0:06:18,000
When PayPal was first starting as a business, their biggest

138
0:06:19.284,000 --> 0:06:21,000
challenge was not, "How do I send money back and forth online?"

139
0:06:22.088,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It was, "How do I do that without being defrauded by organized crime?"

140
0:06:25.96,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Why so challenging? Because while computers can learn

141
0:06:28.048,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to detect and identify fraud based on patterns,

142
0:06:31.192,000 --> 0:06:32,000
they can't learn to do that based on patterns

143
0:06:32.671,000 --> 0:06:34,000
they've never seen before, and organized crime

144
0:06:34.787,000 --> 0:06:36,000
has a lot in common with this audience: brilliant people,

145
0:06:37.496,000 --> 0:06:4,000
relentlessly resourceful, entrepreneurial spirit — (Laughter) —

146
0:06:41.136,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and one huge and important difference: purpose.

147
0:06:43.848,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And so while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest

148
0:06:46.68,000 --> 0:06:48,000
fraudsters, catching the cleverest is the difference

149
0:06:48.933,000 --> 0:06:5,000
between success and failure.

150
0:06:51.478,000 --> 0:06:53,000
There's a whole class of problems like this, ones with

151
0:06:53.699,000 --> 0:06:55,000
adaptive adversaries. They rarely if ever present with a

152
0:06:56.274,000 --> 0:06:58,000
repeatable pattern that's discernable to computers.

153
0:06:59.01,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Instead, there's some inherent component of innovation or disruption,

154
0:07:03.003,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and increasingly these problems are buried in big data.

155
0:07:05.738,000 --> 0:07:07,000
For example, terrorism. Terrorists are always adapting

156
0:07:08.238,000 --> 0:07:1,000
in minor and major ways to new circumstances, and despite

157
0:07:10.29,000 --> 0:07:13,000
what you might see on TV, these adaptations,

158
0:07:13.384,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and the detection of them, are fundamentally human.

159
0:07:15.677,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Computers don't detect novel patterns and new behaviors,

160
0:07:18.794,000 --> 0:07:21,000
but humans do. Humans, using technology, testing hypotheses,

161
0:07:22.029,000 --> 0:07:26,000
searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them.

162
0:07:26.649,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Osama bin Laden was not caught by artificial intelligence.

163
0:07:28.969,000 --> 0:07:3,000
He was caught by dedicated, resourceful, brilliant people

164
0:07:31.522,000 --> 0:07:35,000
in partnerships with various technologies.

165
0:07:35.791,000 --> 0:07:37,000
As appealing as it might sound, you cannot algorithmically

166
0:07:38.609,000 --> 0:07:39,000
data mine your way to the answer.

167
0:07:40.21,000 --> 0:07:42,000
There is no "Find Terrorist" button, and the more data

168
0:07:43.065,000 --> 0:07:45,000
we integrate from a vast variety of sources

169
0:07:45.367,000 --> 0:07:47,000
across a wide variety of data formats from very

170
0:07:47.5,000 --> 0:07:5,000
disparate systems, the less effective data mining can be.

171
0:07:50.809,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Instead, people will have to look at data

172
0:07:52.833,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and search for insight, and as Licklider foresaw long ago,

173
0:07:56.289,000 --> 0:07:58,000
the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation,

174
0:07:58.974,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and as Kasparov realized,

175
0:08:00.498,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that means minimizing friction at the interface.

176
0:08:03.529,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Now this approach makes possible things like combing

177
0:08:06.287,000 --> 0:08:09,000
through all available data from very different sources,

178
0:08:09.673,000 --> 0:08:11,000
identifying key relationships and putting them in one place,

179
0:08:12.465,000 --> 0:08:14,000
something that's been nearly impossible to do before.

180
0:08:15.393,000 --> 0:08:16,000
To some, this has terrifying privacy and civil liberties

181
0:08:17.335,000 --> 0:08:2,000
implications. To others it foretells of an era of greater

182
0:08:20.745,000 --> 0:08:21,000
privacy and civil liberties protections,

183
0:08:22.654,000 --> 0:08:24,000
but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance.

184
0:08:25.59,000 --> 0:08:27,000
That must be acknowledged, and they can't be swept aside,

185
0:08:27.783,000 --> 0:08:29,000
even with the best of intents.

186
0:08:30.313,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So let's explore, through a couple of examples, the impact

187
0:08:32.831,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that technologies built to drive human-computer symbiosis

188
0:08:35.237,000 --> 0:08:37,000
have had in recent time.

189
0:08:38.156,000 --> 0:08:41,000
In October, 2007, U.S. and coalition forces raided

190
0:08:41.572,000 --> 0:08:43,000
an al Qaeda safe house in the city of Sinjar

191
0:08:43.988,000 --> 0:08:44,000
on the Syrian border of Iraq.

192
0:08:45.922,000 --> 0:08:47,000
They found a treasure trove of documents:

193
0:08:48.298,000 --> 0:08:5,000
700 biographical sketches of foreign fighters.

194
0:08:50.633,000 --> 0:08:52,000
These foreign fighters had left their families in the Gulf,

195
0:08:53.217,000 --> 0:08:56,000
the Levant and North Africa to join al Qaeda in Iraq.

196
0:08:56.363,000 --> 0:08:57,000
These records were human resource forms.

197
0:08:57.979,000 --> 0:08:59,000
The foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization.

198
0:09:00.834,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It turns out that al Qaeda, too,

199
0:09:02.045,000 --> 0:09:04,000
is not without its bureaucracy. (Laughter)

200
0:09:04.642,000 --> 0:09:06,000
They answered questions like, "Who recruited you?"

201
0:09:06.74,000 --> 0:09:08,000
"What's your hometown?" "What occupation do you seek?"

202
0:09:09.594,000 --> 0:09:12,000
In that last question, a surprising insight was revealed.

203
0:09:12.763,000 --> 0:09:14,000
The vast majority of foreign fighters

204
0:09:15.163,000 --> 0:09:17,000
were seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom --

205
0:09:17.563,000 --> 0:09:21,000
hugely important, since between 2003 and 2007, Iraq

206
0:09:21.901,000 --> 0:09:25,000
had 1,382 suicide bombings, a major source of instability.

207
0:09:26.145,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Analyzing this data was hard. The originals were sheets

208
0:09:28.203,000 --> 0:09:3,000
of paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated.

209
0:09:30.945,000 --> 0:09:32,000
The friction in the process did not allow for meaningful

210
0:09:33.137,000 --> 0:09:36,000
results in an operational time frame using humans, PDFs

211
0:09:36.487,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and tenacity alone.

212
0:09:38.705,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The researchers had to lever up their human minds

213
0:09:40.658,000 --> 0:09:42,000
with technology to dive deeper, to explore non-obvious

214
0:09:43.003,000 --> 0:09:46,000
hypotheses, and in fact, insights emerged.

215
0:09:46.221,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Twenty percent of the foreign fighters were from Libya,

216
0:09:48.865,000 --> 0:09:5,000
50 percent of those from a single town in Libya,

217
0:09:51.833,000 --> 0:09:53,000
hugely important since prior statistics put that figure at

218
0:09:54.283,000 --> 0:09:56,000
three percent. It also helped to hone in on a figure

219
0:09:56.666,000 --> 0:09:58,000
of rising importance in al Qaeda, Abu Yahya al-Libi,

220
0:09:59.643,000 --> 0:10:01,000
a senior cleric in the Libyan Islamic fighting group.

221
0:10:02.274,000 --> 0:10:04,000
In March of 2007, he gave a speech, after which there was

222
0:10:04.938,000 --> 0:10:07,000
a surge in participation amongst Libyan foreign fighters.

223
0:10:08.404,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Perhaps most clever of all, though, and least obvious,

224
0:10:11.51,000 --> 0:10:13,000
by flipping the data on its head, the researchers were

225
0:10:13.583,000 --> 0:10:15,000
able to deeply explore the coordination networks in Syria

226
0:10:16.483,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that were ultimately responsible for receiving and

227
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:21,000
transporting the foreign fighters to the border.

228
0:10:21.464,000 --> 0:10:23,000
These were networks of mercenaries, not ideologues,

229
0:10:24.097,000 --> 0:10:26,000
who were in the coordination business for profit.

230
0:10:26.495,000 --> 0:10:27,000
For example, they charged Saudi foreign fighters

231
0:10:28.399,000 --> 0:10:3,000
substantially more than Libyans, money that would have

232
0:10:30.598,000 --> 0:10:32,000
otherwise gone to al Qaeda.

233
0:10:32.918,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Perhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network

234
0:10:34.963,000 --> 0:10:37,000
if they knew they cheating would-be jihadists.

235
0:10:37.998,000 --> 0:10:4,000
In January, 2010, a devastating 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti,

236
0:10:41.743,000 --> 0:10:43,000
third deadliest earthquake of all time, left one million people,

237
0:10:44.659,000 --> 0:10:46,000
10 percent of the population, homeless.

238
0:10:47.243,000 --> 0:10:5,000
One seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort

239
0:10:50.38,000 --> 0:10:52,000
became increasingly important as the delivery of food

240
0:10:52.556,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and water started rolling.

241
0:10:54.716,000 --> 0:10:55,000
January and February are the dry months in Haiti,

242
0:10:56.174,000 --> 0:10:58,000
yet many of the camps had developed standing water.

243
0:10:59.116,000 --> 0:11:01,000
The only institution with detailed knowledge of Haiti's

244
0:11:01.238,000 --> 0:11:02,000
floodplains had been leveled

245
0:11:02.535,000 --> 0:11:05,000
in the earthquake, leadership inside.

246
0:11:05.543,000 --> 0:11:07,000
So the question is, which camps are at risk,

247
0:11:08.118,000 --> 0:11:09,000
how many people are in these camps, what's the

248
0:11:10.039,000 --> 0:11:12,000
timeline for flooding, and given very limited resources

249
0:11:12.35,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and infrastructure, how do we prioritize the relocation?

250
0:11:15.734,000 --> 0:11:17,000
The data was incredibly disparate. The U.S. Army had

251
0:11:18.078,000 --> 0:11:2,000
detailed knowledge for only a small section of the country.

252
0:11:21.007,000 --> 0:11:23,000
There was data online from a 2006 environmental risk

253
0:11:23.518,000 --> 0:11:25,000
conference, other geospatial data, none of it integrated.

254
0:11:26.182,000 --> 0:11:28,000
The human goal here was to identify camps for relocation

255
0:11:29.14,000 --> 0:11:31,000
based on priority need.

256
0:11:31.535,000 --> 0:11:33,000
The computer had to integrate a vast amount of geospacial

257
0:11:33.975,000 --> 0:11:35,000
information, social media data and relief organization

258
0:11:36.559,000 --> 0:11:39,000
information to answer this question.

259
0:11:40.039,000 --> 0:11:42,000
By implementing a superior process, what was otherwise

260
0:11:42.454,000 --> 0:11:44,000
a task for 40 people over three months became

261
0:11:45.062,000 --> 0:11:48,000
a simple job for three people in 40 hours,

262
0:11:48.238,000 --> 0:11:5,000
all victories for human-computer symbiosis.

263
0:11:50.866,000 --> 0:11:52,000
We're more than 50 years into Licklider's vision

264
0:11:52.92,000 --> 0:11:54,000
for the future, and the data suggests that we should be

265
0:11:55.162,000 --> 0:11:58,000
quite excited about tackling this century's hardest problems,

266
0:11:58.192,000 --> 0:12:,000
man and machine in cooperation together.

267
0:12:01.139,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Thank you. (Applause)

268
0:12:03.336,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Applause)

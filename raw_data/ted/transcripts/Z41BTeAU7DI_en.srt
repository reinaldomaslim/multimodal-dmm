1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
This machine, which we all have residing in our skulls,

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
reminds me of an aphorism, of a

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
comment of Woody Allen

4
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to ask about what is the very best thing to have within your skull.

5
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And it's this machine.

6
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And it's constructed for change. It's all about change.

7
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It confers on us the ability to do things tomorrow that we can't do today,

8
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
things today that we couldn't do yesterday.

9
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And of course it's born stupid.

10
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The last time you were in the presence of a baby --

11
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
this happens to be my granddaughter, Mitra.

12
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Isn't she fabulous?

13
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But nonetheless when she popped out

15
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
despite the fact that her brain had actually been progressing

16
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in its development for several months before

17
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
on the basis of her experiences in the womb --

18
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
nonetheless she had very limited abilities,

19
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
as does every infant

20
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
at the time of normal, natural full-term birth.

21
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
If we were to assay her perceptual abilities, they would be crude.

22
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
There is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on.

23
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
In fact there is little evidence that there is any

24
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
cognitive ability in a very young infant.

25
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Infants don't respond to much.

26
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
There is not really much of an indication in fact that there is a person on board.

27
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And they can only in a very primitive way, and in a very limited way

29
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
control their movements.

30
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It would be several months before this infant

31
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
could do something as simple as reach out and grasp

32
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
under voluntary control an object and retrieve it,

33
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
usually to the mouth.

34
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And it will be some months beforeward,

35
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and we see a long steady progression

36
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
of the evolution from the first wiggles,

37
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to rolling over, and sitting up, and crawling,

38
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
standing, walking,

39
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
before we get to that magical point

40
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
in which we can motate in the world.

41
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And yet, when we look forward in the brain

42
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
we see really remarkable advance.

43
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
By this age the brain can actually store.

44
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It has stored, recorded,

45
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
can fastly retrieve

46
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
the meanings of thousands,

47
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
tens of thousands of objects,

48
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
actions, and their relationships in the world.

49
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands,

50
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
potentially millions of ways.

51
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
By this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities.

52
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills.

53
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
This brain is very much a thinking machine.

54
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And by this age there is absolutely no question

55
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that this brain, it has a person on board.

56
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self-development.

57
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And by this age we see a remarkable evolution

58
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
in its capacity to control movement.

59
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Now movement has advanced to the point

60
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
where it can actually control movement simultaneously,

61
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
in a complex sequence, in complex ways

62
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
as would be required for example

63
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
for playing a complicated game,

64
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
like soccer.

65
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Now this boy can bounce a soccer ball on his head.

66
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And where this boy comes from, Sao Paulo, Brazil,

67
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
about 40 percent of boys of his age have this ability.

68
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
You could go out into the community in Monterey,

69
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and you'd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability.

70
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And if you did he'd probably be from Sao Paulo.

71
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
That's all another way of saying

73
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that our individual skills and abilities

74
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
are very much shaped by our environments.

75
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
That environment extends into our contemporary culture,

76
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
the thing our brain is challenged with.

77
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Because what we've done in our personal evolutions

78
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
is build up a large repertoire of specific skills and abilities

79
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that are specific to our own individual histories.

80
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And in fact they result in a wonderful

81
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
differentiation in humankind,

82
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
in the way that, in fact, no two of us

83
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
are quite alike.

84
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Every one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities

85
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that all derive out of the plasticity,

86
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
the adaptability of this really remarkable adaptive machine.

87
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
In an adult brain of course we've built up

88
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
a large repertoire of mastered skills and abilities

89
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that we can perform more or less automatically from memory,

90
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and that define us as acting, moving, thinking creatures.

91
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
Now we study this,

92
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
as the nerdy, laboratory, university-based scientists that we are,

93
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
by engaging the brains

94
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
of animals like rats, or monkeys,

95
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
or of this particularly curious creature --

96
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
one of the more bizarre forms of life on earth --

97
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to engage them in learning new skills and abilities.

98
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And we try to track the changes that occur

99
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
as the new skill or ability is acquired.

100
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
In fact we do this in individuals

101
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
of any age, in these different species --

102
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that is to say from infancies,

103
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
infancy up to adulthood and old age.

104
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So we might engage a rat, for example,

105
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
to acquire a new skill or ability

106
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that might involve the rat using its paw

107
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
to master particular manual grasp behaviors

108
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
just like we might examine a child

109
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and their ability to acquire the sub-skills,

110
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
or the general overall skill of accomplishing something

111
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
like mastering the ability to read.

112
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Or you might look in an older individual

113
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
who has mastered a complex set of abilities

114
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that might relate to reading musical notation

115
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
or performing the mechanical acts of performance

116
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that apply to musical performance.

117
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
From these studies we defined two great epochs

118
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
of the plastic history of the brain.

119
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The first great epoch is commonly called the "Critical Period."

120
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And that is the period in which the brain is setting up

121
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
in its initial form its basic processing machinery.

122
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
This is actually a period of dramatic change

123
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
in which it doesn't take learning, per se, to drive

124
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
the initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain.

125
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
All it takes for example in the sound domain,

126
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
is exposure to sound.

127
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And the brain actually is at the mercy

128
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
of the sound environment in which it is reared.

129
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So for example I can rear an animal

130
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound,

131
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
a repertoire of sound that I make up,

132
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that I make, just by exposure, artificially important

133
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to the animal and its young brain.

134
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And what I see is that the animal's brain sets up

135
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
its initial processing of that sound

136
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
in a form that's idealized, within the limits of its processing achievements

137
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to represent it in an organized and orderly way.

138
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The sound doesn't have to be valuable to the animal:

139
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable,

140
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
like the sounds that simulate

141
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
the sounds of a native language of a child.

142
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And I see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized --

143
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
specialized for that complex array, a repertoire of sounds.

144
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It actually exaggerates their separateness of representation,

145
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
in multi-dimensional neuronal representational terms.

146
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Or I can expose the animal to a completely meaningless and destructive sound.

147
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I can raise an animal under conditions

148
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that would be equivalent to raising a baby

149
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
under a moderately loud ceiling fan,

150
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in the presence of continuous noise.

151
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And when I do that I actually specialize the brain

152
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
to be a master processor for that meaningless sound.

153
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And I frustrate its ability

154
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to represent any meaningful sound as a consequence.

155
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Such things in the early history of babies

156
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
occur in real babies.

157
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And they account for, for example

158
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
the beautiful evolution of a language-specific processor

159
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
in every normally developing baby.

160
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And so they also account for

161
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
development of defective processing

162
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
in a substantial population of children

163
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
who are more limited, as a consequence,

164
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
in their language abilities at an older age.

165
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Now in this early period of plasticity

166
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
the brain actually changes outside of a learning context.

167
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I don't have to be paying attention to what I hear.

168
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The input doesn't really have to be meaningful.

169
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I don't have to be in a behavioral context.

170
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
This is required so the brain sets up it's processing

171
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
so that it can act differentially,

172
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
so that it can act selectively,

173
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
so that the creature that wears it, that carries it,

174
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
can begin to operate on it in a selective way.

175
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
In the next great epoch of life, which applies for most of life,

176
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the brain is actually refining its machinery

177
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
as it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities.

178
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And in this epoch,

179
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
which extends from late in the first year of life to death;

180
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
it's actually doing this under behavioral control.

181
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And that's another way of saying

182
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
the brain has strategies that define

183
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the significance of the input to the brain.

184
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And it's focusing on skill after skill,

185
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
or ability after ability,

186
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
under specific attentional control.

187
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It's a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved

188
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
or whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior.

189
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
This is actually very powerful.

190
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
This lifelong capacity for plasticity, for brain change,

191
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
is powerfully expressed.

192
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It is the basis of our real differentiation,

193
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
one individual from another.

194
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
You can look down in the brain of an animal

195
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
that's engaged in a specific skill,

196
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels.

197
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So here is a very simple experiment.

198
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It was actually conducted about five years ago

199
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
in collaboration with scientists from the University of Provence

200
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
in Marseilles.

201
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It's a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained

202
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
in a task that involves it manipulating a tool

203
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that's equivalent in its difficulty

204
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon.

205
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
The monkey actually mastered the task

206
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
in about 700 practice tries.

207
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all.

208
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
It had a success rate of about one in eight tries.

209
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Those tries were elaborate.

210
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Each attempt was substantially different from the other.

211
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But the monkey gradually developed a strategy.

212
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And 700 or so tries later

213
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
the monkey is performing it flawlessly -- never fails.

214
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
He's successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time.

215
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
At this point the task is being performed

216
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
in a beautifully stereotyped way:

217
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
very beautifully regulated and highly repeated, trial to trial.

218
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We can look down in the brain of the monkey.

219
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And we see that it's distorted.

220
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
We can track these changes, and have tracked these changes

221
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
in many such behaviors across time.

222
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And here we see the distortion

223
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
reflected in the map of the skin surfaces of the hand of the monkey.

224
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Now this is a map, down in the surface of the brain,

225
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
in which, in a very elaborate experiment we've reconstructed the responses,

226
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
location by location,

227
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons.

228
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
We see here a reconstruction of how

229
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
the hand is represented in the brain.

230
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
We've actually distorted the map by the exercise.

231
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And that is indicated in the pink. We have a couple fingertip surfaces that are larger.

232
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
These are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool.

233
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
If we look at the selectivity of responses

234
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
in the cortex of the monkey,

235
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
we see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics

236
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
which represents input from the skin

237
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
of the fingertips that are engaged.

238
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
In other words there is still a single, simple representation of the fingertips

239
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
in this most organized of cortical areas

240
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
of the surface of the skin of the body.

241
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Monkey has like you have.

242
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And yet now it's represented in substantially finer grain.

243
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
The monkey is getting more detailed information from these surfaces.

244
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And that is an unknown -- unsuspected, maybe, by you --

245
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
part of acquiring the skill or ability.

246
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Now actually we've looked in several different cortical areas

247
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
in the monkey learning this task.

248
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
And each one of them changes in ways that are specific

249
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
to the skill or ability.

250
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So for example we can look to the cortical area

251
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that represents input that's controlling the posture of the monkey.

252
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We look in cortical areas that control specific movements,

253
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and the sequences of movements

254
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that are required in the behavior, and so forth.

255
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
They are all remodeled. They all become specialized for the task at hand.

256
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
There are 15 or 20 cortical areas that are changed specifically

257
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
when you learn a simple skill like this.

258
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And that represents in your brain, really massive change.

259
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
It represents the change in a reliable way

260
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
of the responses of tens of millions,

261
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
possibly hundreds of millions of neurons in your brain.

262
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
It represents changes

263
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
of hundreds of millions, possibly billions

264
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
of synaptic connections in your brain.

265
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
This is constructed by physical change.

266
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And the level of construction that occurs is massive.

267
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child

268
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general.

269
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Or acquiring their native language abilities.

270
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
The changes are massive.

271
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
What it's all about is the selective representations

272
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
of things that are important to the brain.

273
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Because in most of the life of the brain

274
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
this is under control of behavioral context.

275
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It's what you pay attention to.

276
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
It's what's rewarding to you.

277
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
It's what the brain regards, itself,

278
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
as positive and important to you.

279
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
It's all about cortical processing

280
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and forebrain specialization.

281
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And that underlies your specialization.

282
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
That is why you, in your many skills and abilities,

283
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
are a unique specialist:

284
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
a specialist that's vastly different

285
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
in your physical brain in detail

286
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
than the brain of an individual 100 years ago;

287
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
enormously different in the details

288
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
from the brain of the average individual 1,000 years ago.

289
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Now, one of the characteristics of this change process

290
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
is that information is always related

291
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
to other inputs or information that is occurring

292
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
in immediate time, in context.

293
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And that's because the brain is constructing representations of things

294
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
that are correlated in little moments of time

295
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and that relate to one another in little moments of successive time.

296
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
The brain is recording all information

297
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and driving all change

298
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
in temporal context.

299
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Now overwhelmingly the most powerful context

300
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
that's occurred in your brain is you.

301
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Billions of events have occurred in your history

302
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
that are related in time to yourself

303
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
as the receiver,

304
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
or yourself as the actor, yourself as the thinker,

305
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
yourself as the mover.

306
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in

307
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
from the surface of your body

308
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
that are always associated with you as the receiver,

309
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and that result in

310
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
the embodiment of you.

311
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
You are constructed, your self is constructed

312
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
from these billions of events.

313
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
It's constructed. It's created in your brain.

314
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And it's created in the brain via physical change.

315
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
This is a marvelously constructed thing

316
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
that results in individual form

317
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
because each one of us has vastly different histories,

318
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and vastly different experiences,

319
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
that drive in to us this marvelous differentiation of self,

320
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
of personhood.

321
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Now we've used this research

322
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
to try to understand not just how a normal person develops,

323
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and elaborates their skills and abilities,

324
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
but also try to understand

325
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
the origins of impairment,

326
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and the origins of differences or variations

327
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
that might limit the capacities of a child, or an adult.

328
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
I'm going to talk about using these strategies

329
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
to actually design brain plasticity-based

330
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child

331
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
that increases the competence of the child

332
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
as a language receiver and user

333
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and, thereafter, as a reader.

334
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And I'm going to talk about experiments that involve

335
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
actually using this brain science,

336
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
first of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age.

337
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And then, by using it in a targeted approach

338
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
we're going to try to differentiate

339
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
the machinery to recover function in old age.

340
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
So the first example I'm going to talk about

341
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
relates to children with learning impairments.

342
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
We now have a large body of literature

343
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
that demonstrates that the fundamental

344
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
problem that occurs in the majority of children

345
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
that have early language impairments,

346
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and that are going to struggle to learn to read,

347
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
is that their language processor

348
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
is created in a defective form.

349
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And the reason that it rises in a defective form

350
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
is because early in the baby's brain's life

351
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
the machine process is noisy.

352
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
It's that simple.

353
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
It's a signal-to-noise problem. Okay?

354
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And there are a lot of things that contribute to that.

355
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
There are numerous inherited faults

356
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
that could make the machine process noisier.

357
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Now I might say the noise problem could also occur

358
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
on the basis of information provided

359
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
in the world from the ears.

360
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
If any -- those of you who are older in the audience know

361
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
that when I was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate

362
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
was born with what we called mental retardation.

363
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
We knew that they were going to be slow cognitively;

364
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
we knew they were going to struggle to learn to develop normal language abilities;

365
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read.

366
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Most of them would be intellectual and academic failures.

367
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
That's disappeared. That no longer applies.

368
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
That inherited weakness, that inherited condition

369
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
has evaporated.

370
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
We don't hear about that anymore. Where did it go?

371
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Well, it was understood by a Dutch surgeon,

372
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
about 35 years ago,

373
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
that if you simply fix the problem early enough,

374
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
when the brain is still in this initial plastic period

375
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
so it can set up this machinery adequately,

376
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
in this initial set up time in the critical period,

377
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
none of that happens.

378
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
What are you doing by operating on the cleft palate to correct it?

379
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
You're basically opening up

380
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
the tubes that drain fluid from the middle ears,

381
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
which have had them reliably full.

382
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled.

383
0:16:51.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
It's degraded.

384
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
The child's native language is such a case is not English.

385
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
It's not Japanese.

386
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:01,000
It's muffled English. It's degraded Japanese.

387
0:17:01.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
It's crap.

388
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
And the brain specializes for it.

389
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
It creates a representation of language crap.

390
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:1,000
And then the child is stuck with it.

391
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Now the crap doesn't just happen in the ear.

392
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
It can also happen in the brain.

393
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
The brain itself can be noisy. It's commonly noisy.

394
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
There are many inherited faults that can make it noisier.

395
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
And the native language for a child with such a brain

396
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
is degraded.

397
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
It's not English. It's noisy English.

398
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
And that results in defective representations of sounds of words --

399
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
not normal -- a different strategy,

400
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
by a machine that has different time constants and different space constants.

401
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
And you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants.

402
0:17:43.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
They are about an order of magnitude longer,

403
0:17:46.16,000 --> 0:17:49,000
about 11 times longer in duration on average,

404
0:17:49.16,000 --> 0:17:51,000
than in a normal child.

405
0:17:51.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Space constants are about three times greater.

406
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:17:56,000
Such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits

407
0:17:56.16,000 --> 0:17:58,000
in this domain.

408
0:17:58.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
Of course they will. Because as a receiver of language,

409
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
they are receiving it and representing it,

410
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
and in information it's representing crap.

411
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:09,000
And they are going to have poor reading skills.

412
0:18:09.16,000 --> 0:18:12,000
Because reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds

413
0:18:12.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
into this orthographic or visual

414
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:17,000
representational form.

415
0:18:17.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
If you don't have a brain representation of word sounds

416
0:18:19.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
that translation makes no sense.

417
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:25,000
And you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology.

418
0:18:25.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
Then these children increasingly

419
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:29,000
in evaluation after evaluation,

420
0:18:29.16,000 --> 0:18:31,000
in their operations in language, and their operations in reading --

421
0:18:31.16,000 --> 0:18:36,000
we document that abnormal neurology.

422
0:18:36.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
The point is is that you can train the brain out of this.

423
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:4,000
A way to think about this is you can actually re-refine

424
0:18:40.16,000 --> 0:18:42,000
the processing capacity of the machinery

425
0:18:42.16,000 --> 0:18:44,000
by changing it.

426
0:18:44.16,000 --> 0:18:47,000
Changing it in detail. It takes about 30 hours on the average.

427
0:18:47.16,000 --> 0:18:51,000
And we've accomplished that in about 430,000 kids today.

428
0:18:51.16,000 --> 0:18:56,000
Actually, probably about 15,000 children are being trained as we speak.

429
0:18:56.16,000 --> 0:18:59,000
And actually when you look at the impacts, the impacts are substantial.

430
0:18:59.16,000 --> 0:19:01,000
So here we're looking at the normal distribution.

431
0:19:01.16,000 --> 0:19:03,000
What we're most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution.

432
0:19:03.16,000 --> 0:19:05,000
This is from about 3,000 children.

433
0:19:05.16,000 --> 0:19:08,000
You can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution

434
0:19:08.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
are moving into the middle or the right.

435
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:13,000
This is in a broad assessment of their language abilities.

436
0:19:13.16,000 --> 0:19:15,000
This is like an IQ test for language.

437
0:19:15.16,000 --> 0:19:18,000
The impact in the distribution, if you trained every child

438
0:19:18.16,000 --> 0:19:21,000
in the United States, would be to shift the whole distribution to the right

439
0:19:21.16,000 --> 0:19:23,000
and narrow the distribution.

440
0:19:23.16,000 --> 0:19:25,000
This is a substantially large impact.

441
0:19:25.16,000 --> 0:19:28,000
Think of a classroom of children in the language arts.

442
0:19:28.16,000 --> 0:19:31,000
Think of the children on the slow side of the class.

443
0:19:31.16,000 --> 0:19:33,000
We have the potential to move most of those children

444
0:19:33.16,000 --> 0:19:35,000
to the middle or to the right side.

445
0:19:35.16,000 --> 0:19:37,000
In addition to accurate language training

446
0:19:37.16,000 --> 0:19:39,000
it also fixes memory and cognition

447
0:19:39.16,000 --> 0:19:42,000
speech fluency and speech production.

448
0:19:42.16,000 --> 0:19:45,000
And an important language dependent skill is enabled by this training --

449
0:19:45.16,000 --> 0:19:46,000
that is to say reading.

450
0:19:46.16,000 --> 0:19:48,000
And to a large extent it fixes the brain.

451
0:19:48.16,000 --> 0:19:51,000
You can look down in the brain of a child

452
0:19:51.16,000 --> 0:19:54,000
in a variety of tasks that scientists have at Stanford,

453
0:19:54.16,000 --> 0:20:,000
and MIT, and UCSF, and UCLA, and a number of other institutions.

454
0:20:00.16,000 --> 0:20:03,000
And children operating in various language behaviors,

455
0:20:03.16,000 --> 0:20:05,000
or in various reading behaviors,

456
0:20:05.16,000 --> 0:20:07,000
you see for the most extent,

457
0:20:07.16,000 --> 0:20:09,000
for most children, their neuronal responses,

458
0:20:09.16,000 --> 0:20:11,000
complexly abnormal before you start,

459
0:20:11.16,000 --> 0:20:14,000
are normalized by the training.

460
0:20:14.16,000 --> 0:20:16,000
Now you can also take the same approach

461
0:20:16.16,000 --> 0:20:19,000
to address problems in aging.

462
0:20:19.16,000 --> 0:20:21,000
Where again the machinery is deteriorating now

463
0:20:21.16,000 --> 0:20:25,000
from competent machinery, it's going south.

464
0:20:25.16,000 --> 0:20:27,000
Noise is increasing in the brain.

465
0:20:27.16,000 --> 0:20:3,000
And learning modulation and control is deteriorating.

466
0:20:30.16,000 --> 0:20:32,000
And you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual

467
0:20:32.16,000 --> 0:20:35,000
and witness a change in the time constants and space constants

468
0:20:35.16,000 --> 0:20:38,000
with which, for example, the brain is representing language again.

469
0:20:38.16,000 --> 0:20:41,000
Just as the brain came out of chaos at the beginning,

470
0:20:41.16,000 --> 0:20:44,000
it's going back into chaos in the end.

471
0:20:44.16,000 --> 0:20:46,000
This results in declines in memory

472
0:20:46.16,000 --> 0:20:5,000
in cognition, and in postural ability and agility.

473
0:20:50.16,000 --> 0:20:52,000
It turns out you can train the brain of such an individual --

474
0:20:52.16,000 --> 0:20:55,000
this is a small population of such individuals --

475
0:20:55.16,000 --> 0:20:57,000
train equally intensively for about 30 hours.

476
0:20:57.16,000 --> 0:21:,000
These are 80- to 90-year-olds.

477
0:21:00.16,000 --> 0:21:03,000
And what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory,

478
0:21:03.16,000 --> 0:21:05,000
of their ability to remember things after a delay,

479
0:21:05.16,000 --> 0:21:07,000
of their ability to control their attention,

480
0:21:07.16,000 --> 0:21:09,000
their language abilities and visual-spatial abilities.

481
0:21:09.16,000 --> 0:21:11,000
The overall neuropsychological index

482
0:21:11.16,000 --> 0:21:14,000
of these trained individuals in this population

483
0:21:14.16,000 --> 0:21:16,000
is about two standard deviations.

484
0:21:16.16,000 --> 0:21:18,000
That means that if you sit at the left side of the distribution,

485
0:21:18.16,000 --> 0:21:21,000
and I'm looking at your neuropyschological abilities,

486
0:21:21.16,000 --> 0:21:23,000
the average person has moved to the middle

487
0:21:23.16,000 --> 0:21:25,000
or the right side of the distribution.

488
0:21:25.16,000 --> 0:21:27,000
It means that most people who are at risk for senility,

489
0:21:27.16,000 --> 0:21:29,000
more or less immediately,

490
0:21:29.16,000 --> 0:21:32,000
are now in a protected position.

491
0:21:32.16,000 --> 0:21:35,000
My issues are to try to get to rescuing

492
0:21:35.16,000 --> 0:21:38,000
older citizens more completely and in larger numbers,

493
0:21:38.16,000 --> 0:21:41,000
because I think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale --

494
0:21:41.16,000 --> 0:21:43,000
and the same for kids.

495
0:21:43.16,000 --> 0:21:46,000
My main interest is how to elaborate this science to address other maladies.

496
0:21:46.16,000 --> 0:21:48,000
I'm specifically interested in things like autism,

497
0:21:48.16,000 --> 0:21:51,000
and cerebral palsy, these great childhood catastrophes.

498
0:21:51.16,000 --> 0:21:54,000
And in older age conditions like Parkinsonism,

499
0:21:54.16,000 --> 0:21:59,000
and in other acquired impairments like schizophrenia.

500
0:21:59.16,000 --> 0:22:02,000
Your issues as it relates to this science,

501
0:22:02.16,000 --> 0:22:05,000
is how to maintain your own high-functioning learning machine.

502
0:22:05.16,000 --> 0:22:08,000
And of course, a well-ordered life

503
0:22:08.16,000 --> 0:22:1,000
in which learning is a continuous part of it, is key.

504
0:22:10.16,000 --> 0:22:13,000
But also in your future is brain aerobics.

505
0:22:13.16,000 --> 0:22:15,000
Get ready for it. It's going to be a part of every life

506
0:22:15.16,000 --> 0:22:17,000
not too far in the future,

507
0:22:17.16,000 --> 0:22:19,000
just like physical exercise

508
0:22:19.16,000 --> 0:22:23,000
is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period.

509
0:22:23.16,000 --> 0:22:27,000
The other way that we will ultimately come to consider this

510
0:22:27.16,000 --> 0:22:3,000
literature and the science that is important to you

511
0:22:30.16,000 --> 0:22:32,000
is in a consideration of how to nurture yourself.

512
0:22:32.16,000 --> 0:22:35,000
Now that you know, now that science is telling us

513
0:22:35.16,000 --> 0:22:37,000
that you are in charge,

514
0:22:37.16,000 --> 0:22:39,000
that it's under your control,

515
0:22:39.16,000 --> 0:22:41,000
that your happiness, your well-being,

516
0:22:41.16,000 --> 0:22:43,000
your abilities, your capacities,

517
0:22:43.16,000 --> 0:22:46,000
are capable of continuous modification,

518
0:22:46.16,000 --> 0:22:48,000
continuous improvement,

519
0:22:48.16,000 --> 0:22:51,000
and you're the responsible agent and party.

520
0:22:51.16,000 --> 0:22:53,000
Of course a lot of people will ignore this advice.

521
0:22:53.16,000 --> 0:22:55,000
It will be a long time before they really understand it.

522
0:22:55.16,000 --> 0:22:56,000
(Laughter)

523
0:22:56.16,000 --> 0:22:58,000
Now that's another issue and not my fault.

524
0:22:58.16,000 --> 0:23:,000
Okay. Thank you.

525
0:23:00.16,000 --> 0:23:02,000
(Applause)

0:00:13.016,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Fresh out of college,

3
0:00:14.393,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I went to work for a consulting firm.

4
0:00:16.968,000 --> 0:00:19,000
During orientation, the leaders dished out advice.

5
0:00:21.107,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Amongst them was one pithy counsel I will never forget.

6
0:00:25.189,000 --> 0:00:28,000
He told us, "Be easy to manage."

7
0:00:28.515,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Considering how naïve I really was at the time,

8
0:00:32.328,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I took his advice to heart.

9
0:00:34.119,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I told myself,

10
0:00:35.638,000 --> 0:00:37,000
"Yes, I will be the ultimate team player.

11
0:00:38.518,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I will do everything I'm told.

12
0:00:40.485,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I will be easy to manage."

13
0:00:43.478,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It wasn't until I arrived in graduate school

14
0:00:45.86,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and witnessed firsthand the criminal actions of scientists and engineers

15
0:00:50.8,000 --> 0:00:52,000
in the water crisis in Flint, Michigan

16
0:00:53.553,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that I realized how dangerous and yet surprisingly common

17
0:00:58.135,000 --> 0:01:,000
this line of thinking really is.

18
0:01:00.518,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Make no mistake:

19
0:01:01.709,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the Flint water crisis is one of the most egregious environmental injustices

20
0:01:06.375,000 --> 0:01:07,000
of our time.

21
0:01:07.55,000 --> 0:01:08,000
For over 18 months,

22
0:01:09.13,000 --> 0:01:13,000
100,000 residents, including thousands of young children,

23
0:01:13.236,000 --> 0:01:16,000
were exposed to contaminated drinking water with high levels of lead.

24
0:01:17.86,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Lead is a potent neurotoxin

25
0:01:19.76,000 --> 0:01:22,000
which causes cognitive and developmental disabilities

26
0:01:23.524,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and is especially harmful to growing fetuses and young children.

27
0:01:28.277,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We've known about its dangers since the Roman Empire.

28
0:01:32.619,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Amongst a whole host of health issues,

29
0:01:35.11,000 --> 0:01:38,000
12 people died by contracting Legionnaires' disease.

30
0:01:39.361,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Flint's water infrastructure --

31
0:01:41.187,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the complex network of underground pipes --

32
0:01:44.292,000 --> 0:01:46,000
has been severely damaged.

33
0:01:46.936,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And while the water quality is slowly improving

34
0:01:50.12,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and the pipes are being replaced now,

35
0:01:52.195,000 --> 0:01:53,000
more than two years later,

36
0:01:53.919,000 --> 0:01:55,000
the water is still not safe to drink.

37
0:01:58.096,000 --> 0:02:,000
So, people are still in shock.

38
0:02:01.005,000 --> 0:02:02,000
They ask themselves,

39
0:02:02.337,000 --> 0:02:03,000
"How could this have happened?"

40
0:02:04.903,000 --> 0:02:08,000
The short answer is: the crisis began when an emergency manager,

41
0:02:09.714,000 --> 0:02:11,000
appointed by Michigan's governor,

42
0:02:12.163,000 --> 0:02:16,000
decided to switch their water source to a local river to save money.

43
0:02:17.147,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But it continued for so long

44
0:02:19.066,000 --> 0:02:22,000
because scientists and engineers at government agencies

45
0:02:22.727,000 --> 0:02:25,000
in the state of Michigan and in the federal government

46
0:02:25.806,000 --> 0:02:28,000
did not follow federal regulations for treating the water right.

47
0:02:30.741,000 --> 0:02:31,000
What was more,

48
0:02:31.963,000 --> 0:02:34,000
they actively cheated on the law and orchestrated cover-ups.

49
0:02:35.865,000 --> 0:02:37,000
They ridiculed residents asking for help,

50
0:02:38.82,000 --> 0:02:42,000
while publicly insisting that the brown, smelly water coming out of the tap

51
0:02:43.304,000 --> 0:02:44,000
was safe to drink.

52
0:02:45.568,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The system at the local, state and federal levels completely failed

53
0:02:51.257,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to protect our most vulnerable,

54
0:02:53.273,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and an entire population was left to fend for itself.

55
0:02:58.02,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Now, amidst this injustice, Flint residents were rallying together.

56
0:03:02.804,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Amongst them were some amazing women of Flint --

57
0:03:05.959,000 --> 0:03:07,000
mothers concerned about their kids --

58
0:03:07.984,000 --> 0:03:1,000
who came together forming many grassroots coalitions,

59
0:03:11.901,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and these groups started protesting and demanding change.

60
0:03:16.308,000 --> 0:03:19,000
The group also reached out to outside scientists for help,

61
0:03:20.07,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and a few responded.

62
0:03:22.291,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Amongst them was a guy named Miguel Del Toral,

63
0:03:25.803,000 --> 0:03:29,000
a water expert at the US EPA -- the Environmental Protection Agency --

64
0:03:30.505,000 --> 0:03:32,000
who actually wrote this scientific memo

65
0:03:33.092,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and sent it to the state of Michigan and the federal government

66
0:03:36.256,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to bring their attention to this problem.

67
0:03:39.101,000 --> 0:03:41,000
He was characterized a "rogue employee,"

68
0:03:41.691,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and silenced.

69
0:03:44.542,000 --> 0:03:46,000
In collaboration with Flint residents,

70
0:03:47.358,000 --> 0:03:49,000
our research team here at Tech,

71
0:03:49.716,000 --> 0:03:52,000
of students and scientists led by professor Marc Edwards,

72
0:03:53.002,000 --> 0:03:55,000
conducted citywide testing

73
0:03:55.164,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to prove that Flint's water was indeed contaminated,

74
0:03:58.196,000 --> 0:04:,000
even toxic in some homes.

75
0:04:01.355,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We substantiated what Flint had been screaming for months,

76
0:04:04.518,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and put it on the Internet for the world to see.

77
0:04:07.69,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Now, when I was getting involved,

78
0:04:10.692,000 --> 0:04:11,000
when I said yes to this,

79
0:04:12.11,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I had no idea what I was getting into.

80
0:04:15.277,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But every second of this journey has been totally worth it.

81
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:21,000
This was science in service to the public.

82
0:04:21.789,000 --> 0:04:23,000
This is what I came to graduate school for,

83
0:04:24.342,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and this is how I would rather spend my life.

84
0:04:27.7,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And so this coalition --

85
0:04:29.738,000 --> 0:04:33,000
this unlikely coalition of citizens, pastors, journalists and scientists --

86
0:04:34.655,000 --> 0:04:38,000
came together to uncover the truth using science, advocacy and activism.

87
0:04:39.505,000 --> 0:04:41,000
A local pediatrician figured out

88
0:04:41.662,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that the instances of childhood lead poisoning had indeed doubled

89
0:04:46.025,000 --> 0:04:47,000
in Flint during the crisis.

90
0:04:48.944,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And the state of Michigan was forced to acknowledge the problem

91
0:04:52.655,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and take steps to correct it.

92
0:04:55.199,000 --> 0:04:58,000
This group and many others got Flint's kids protected.

93
0:04:59.826,000 --> 0:05:,000
A few months later,

94
0:05:01.02,000 --> 0:05:04,000
President Obama came in and declared a federal emergency,

95
0:05:04.513,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and now Flint is getting more than 600 million dollars

96
0:05:08.045,000 --> 0:05:11,000
in healthcare, nutrition, education

97
0:05:11.468,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and overhauling their water infrastructure.

98
0:05:14.95,000 --> 0:05:19,000
However, the arrogance and the callous disregard for public health

99
0:05:20.731,000 --> 0:05:24,000
shown by scientists and engineers at these government agencies

100
0:05:25.183,000 --> 0:05:26,000
is beyond belief.

101
0:05:27.539,000 --> 0:05:3,000
These unhealthy cultures that are festering in these groups,

102
0:05:31.105,000 --> 0:05:34,000
where the focus is on meeting regulations and checking boxes

103
0:05:35.074,000 --> 0:05:37,000
as opposed to protecting public health,

104
0:05:37.248,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is just appalling.

105
0:05:39.416,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Just consider this email that an EPA employee wrote,

106
0:05:43.741,000 --> 0:05:45,000
where she goes,

107
0:05:45.987,000 --> 0:05:49,000
"I'm not so sure Flint is a community we want to go out on a limb for."

108
0:05:51.81,000 --> 0:05:55,000
The dehumanization of an entire population could not be more obvious.

109
0:05:56.671,000 --> 0:06:,000
Now, contrast that to the first canon of engineering,

110
0:06:01.604,000 --> 0:06:04,000
which, in my opinion, should be the first law of humanity:

111
0:06:04.889,000 --> 0:06:08,000
"To hold paramount the health, safety and welfare of the public,"

112
0:06:08.99,000 --> 0:06:09,000
above all else.

113
0:06:10.684,000 --> 0:06:13,000
This is the Hippocratic Oath we've rarely acknowledged,

114
0:06:14.152,000 --> 0:06:15,000
let alone embraced.

115
0:06:16.369,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And so when scientists and engineers, very much like medical doctors,

116
0:06:20.619,000 --> 0:06:21,000
screw up,

117
0:06:21.892,000 --> 0:06:22,000
people can get hurt --

118
0:06:23.757,000 --> 0:06:24,000
even die.

119
0:06:25.152,000 --> 0:06:29,000
If our professionals and even students fail to get that,

120
0:06:29.721,000 --> 0:06:31,000
society pays a huge price.

121
0:06:33.472,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Buried deep in history lies a character I deeply admire --

122
0:06:37.697,000 --> 0:06:4,000
an engineer named Peter Palchinsky.

123
0:06:40.862,000 --> 0:06:42,000
He lived in the time of the Soviet Union.

124
0:06:44.187,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And Palchinsky repeatedly got in trouble for his radical honesty

125
0:06:49.203,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and willingness to point out major flaws in the Soviets' mindless pursuit

126
0:06:54.782,000 --> 0:06:55,000
of rapid industrialization.

127
0:06:57.549,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Everyone was expected to follow orders coming from the top.

128
0:07:01.591,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Anyone asking questions or offering feedback was unwelcome.

129
0:07:06.174,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The Soviets had created the largest army of engineers the world had ever seen,

130
0:07:11.476,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and yet most of them were mere cogs in a gigantic machine heading for doom.

131
0:07:17.284,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Palchinsky, on the other hand, implored engineers

132
0:07:20.35,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to look at the economic, political and social consequences of their actions;

133
0:07:25.71,000 --> 0:07:27,000
in other words, be more public-focused.

134
0:07:28.723,000 --> 0:07:31,000
His fearless voice of reason was seen as a threat

135
0:07:32.546,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to the political establishment,

136
0:07:34.387,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and Joseph Stalin had him executed in 1929.

137
0:07:39.511,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Palchinsky's view on technocrats is very different

138
0:07:43.697,000 --> 0:07:48,000
from one that is still very popular, still very common --

139
0:07:49.071,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that of a dispassionate researcher working in his ivory tower lab,

140
0:07:54.804,000 --> 0:07:56,000
or a nerdy engineer working in his cubicle.

141
0:07:58.338,000 --> 0:08:,000
Brilliant, no doubt,

142
0:08:00.654,000 --> 0:08:01,000
yet somehow cut off from the world,

143
0:08:02.608,000 --> 0:08:04,000
shows little emotion --

144
0:08:04.844,000 --> 0:08:07,000
kind of like Spock from "Star Trek," you know?

145
0:08:08.767,000 --> 0:08:09,000
This guy.

146
0:08:10.027,000 --> 0:08:11,000
(Laughter)

147
0:08:11.648,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Let's try and do the Spock salute.

148
0:08:14.096,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I don't think I'll succeed ...

149
0:08:16.819,000 --> 0:08:17,000
See, I can't be Spock.

150
0:08:18.484,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Thank goodness I can't be Spock.

151
0:08:20.646,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Laughter)

152
0:08:23.152,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I was reminded of this distinction because a recent article came out

153
0:08:27.933,000 --> 0:08:3,000
in a very reputed scientific journal,

154
0:08:31.183,000 --> 0:08:36,000
which kind of characterized our Flint work as driven by "youthful idealism,"

155
0:08:36.53,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and "Hollywood's dramatic sensibilities."

156
0:08:39.233,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It asks scientists to protect their research funding and institutions

157
0:08:44.748,000 --> 0:08:47,000
at all costs, no matter how just the cause.

158
0:08:48.123,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And if you think you have to get involved in something,

159
0:08:51.469,000 --> 0:08:53,000
even if it's an emergency,

160
0:08:53.528,000 --> 0:08:57,000
try finding an activist group or an NGO,

161
0:08:57.705,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and obtain the full support of the academic community --

162
0:09:00.725,000 --> 0:09:01,000
whatever that means --

163
0:09:02.087,000 --> 0:09:03,000
before you get involved.

164
0:09:04.447,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Not one mention of our moral and professional obligation

165
0:09:08.616,000 --> 0:09:1,000
of preventing harm to the public,

166
0:09:10.703,000 --> 0:09:13,000
or the fact that we have all this expertise,

167
0:09:14.096,000 --> 0:09:17,000
resources and, for some, even tenure

168
0:09:17.145,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to, you know, accomplish this task.

169
0:09:20.597,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I'm not saying every scientist should be an activist.

170
0:09:23.349,000 --> 0:09:27,000
There are real and sometimes very painful consequences of speaking up.

171
0:09:28.192,000 --> 0:09:32,000
But to denounce this idea, this possibility so completely

172
0:09:33.047,000 --> 0:09:35,000
so that you can protect research funding,

173
0:09:35.467,000 --> 0:09:37,000
simply screams of self-serving cowardice,

174
0:09:38.116,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and these are not the ideals we would want to pass to our students.

175
0:09:44.39,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And so you may think, "OK, all this sounds great,

176
0:09:47.776,000 --> 0:09:5,000
but you'll never completely change organizational cultures,

177
0:09:51.423,000 --> 0:09:55,000
or imbibe mindsets in students and professionals

178
0:09:55.494,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to look at their work as a public good --

179
0:09:58.155,000 --> 0:10:,000
science in service to the public."

180
0:10:00.887,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Maybe so.

181
0:10:02.374,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But could a big reason for that be

182
0:10:04.64,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that we are not training our students right?

183
0:10:07.841,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Because if you look closely,

184
0:10:10.167,000 --> 0:10:14,000
our education system today is focused more on creating

185
0:10:15.103,000 --> 0:10:2,000
what ex-Yale professor Bill Deresiewicz calls "excellent sheep" --

186
0:10:20.182,000 --> 0:10:22,000
young people who are smart and ambitious,

187
0:10:23.061,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and yet somehow risk-averse, timid, directionless

188
0:10:27.989,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and, sometimes, full of themselves.

189
0:10:30.815,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Now, kids ... you know,

190
0:10:32.758,000 --> 0:10:34,000
we fell in love with science when we were kids,

191
0:10:35.398,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and yet we somehow spend most of our time during high school and college

192
0:10:39.724,000 --> 0:10:4,000
just jumping through hoops

193
0:10:41.245,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and doing things so that we can polish our résumé

194
0:10:44.736,000 --> 0:10:45,000
instead of sitting down

195
0:10:46.43,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and reflecting on what we want to do and who we want to be.

196
0:10:52.952,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And so,

197
0:10:55.444,000 --> 0:10:58,000
the markers of empathy in our college graduates

198
0:10:59.103,000 --> 0:11:02,000
have been dropping dramatically in the past two decades,

199
0:11:02.27,000 --> 0:11:04,000
while those of narcissism are on the rise.

200
0:11:05.02,000 --> 0:11:07,000
There is also a growing culture of disengagement

201
0:11:07.715,000 --> 0:11:09,000
between engineering students and the public.

202
0:11:11.431,000 --> 0:11:16,000
We are trained to build bridges and solve complex problems

203
0:11:16.729,000 --> 0:11:21,000
but not how to think or live or be a citizen of this world.

204
0:11:21.767,000 --> 0:11:25,000
My undergraduate years were explicit job preparation,

205
0:11:26.184,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and I cannot tell you how suffocating and painful it was at times.

206
0:11:31.748,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And so,

207
0:11:33.384,000 --> 0:11:36,000
some people think the solution to great engineers, to great scientists,

208
0:11:36.985,000 --> 0:11:37,000
is more technical training.

209
0:11:38.813,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Maybe so.

210
0:11:40.07,000 --> 0:11:43,000
But where are the discussions on ethical decision-making,

211
0:11:43.588,000 --> 0:11:44,000
or building character,

212
0:11:45.437,000 --> 0:11:47,000
or discerning right from wrong?

213
0:11:49.442,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Consider this project that I deeply love and admire.

214
0:11:53.832,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It's called, "Heroic Imagination Project."

215
0:11:56.634,000 --> 0:11:58,000
A brainchild of Dr. Phil Zimbardo,

216
0:11:59.281,000 --> 0:12:01,000
famous for the Stanford Prison Experiment,

217
0:12:02.083,000 --> 0:12:07,000
this program seeks to train school-going children around the world

218
0:12:07.352,000 --> 0:12:1,000
to look at themselves as heroes-in-waiting,

219
0:12:10.816,000 --> 0:12:11,000
or heroes-in-training.

220
0:12:12.756,000 --> 0:12:17,000
So, these young minds work over time to develop skills and virtues

221
0:12:18.131,000 --> 0:12:2,000
so that when the opportunity comes,

222
0:12:20.315,000 --> 0:12:22,000
no matter what that opportunity be,

223
0:12:22.909,000 --> 0:12:24,000
to stand up and do the right thing.

224
0:12:26.18,000 --> 0:12:27,000
In other words,

225
0:12:27.491,000 --> 0:12:28,000
anyone can be a hero.

226
0:12:30.227,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Think about that idea for a second.

227
0:12:32.951,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Why don't we teach science and engineering like that --

228
0:12:36.083,000 --> 0:12:4,000
where heroism and public service are seen as key values,

229
0:12:40.485,000 --> 0:12:42,000
because indeed, it's often heroism

230
0:12:43.127,000 --> 0:12:46,000
that is not only the antidote to public indifference,

231
0:12:46.899,000 --> 0:12:49,000
but also to systemic evil like we saw in Flint.

232
0:12:51.957,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And so, dream with me

233
0:12:53.415,000 --> 0:12:57,000
what a 21st-century scientist slash engineer could look like:

234
0:12:57.596,000 --> 0:13:,000
individuals who are driven to master the sciences

235
0:13:01.173,000 --> 0:13:02,000
so that they can serve society,

236
0:13:03.171,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and are also aware

237
0:13:04.389,000 --> 0:13:07,000
of the tremendous power their knowledge and decisions have;

238
0:13:08.36,000 --> 0:13:11,000
folks who are developing their moral courage at all times,

239
0:13:12.127,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and who realize that conflict and controversy

240
0:13:15.937,000 --> 0:13:17,000
are not necessarily bad things

241
0:13:18.065,000 --> 0:13:21,000
if our ultimate loyalty is to the public and the planet.

242
0:13:22.641,000 --> 0:13:27,000
These are the people who will stand up like we did in Flint --

243
0:13:27.707,000 --> 0:13:3,000
not to be saviors or heroes in the media,

244
0:13:31.466,000 --> 0:13:37,000
but altruistic and fundamentally good actors that you and I can trust.

245
0:13:39.537,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Imagine fostering such a public-focused mindset

246
0:13:44.354,000 --> 0:13:47,000
in classes, on service trips and during activities

247
0:13:47.833,000 --> 0:13:49,000
during college or even high school,

248
0:13:50.199,000 --> 0:13:53,000
so that these young minds will hold onto those ideals

249
0:13:54.037,000 --> 0:13:56,000
when they actually enter the real world,

250
0:13:56.533,000 --> 0:14:,000
whether that be consulting, academia, policy making --

251
0:14:00.68,000 --> 0:14:02,000
or even becoming the president of a country.

252
0:14:05.362,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Some of mankind's greatest challenges lie ahead of us;

253
0:14:08.934,000 --> 0:14:11,000
contaminated drinking water is just one example.

254
0:14:12.411,000 --> 0:14:14,000
We could definitely use more --

255
0:14:14.505,000 --> 0:14:18,000
nay, we desperately need more -- compassionate upstanders

256
0:14:19.516,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and public-focused scientists and engineers

257
0:14:22.674,000 --> 0:14:24,000
who will strive to the do right thing,

258
0:14:24.707,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and not be easy to manage.

259
0:14:26.743,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Thank you.

260
0:14:27.938,000 --> 0:14:31,000
(Applause)

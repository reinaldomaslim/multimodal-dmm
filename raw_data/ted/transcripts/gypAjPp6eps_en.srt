1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,

2
0:00:17.28,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and it is my job, my responsibility, as an astronomer

3
0:00:22,000 --> 0:00:28,000
to remind people that alien hypotheses should always be a last resort.

4
0:00:29.44,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Now, I want to tell you a story about that.

5
0:00:31.6,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It involves data from a NASA mission,

6
0:00:35.2,000 --> 0:00:39,000
ordinary people and one of the most extraordinary stars in our galaxy.

7
0:00:41.8,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It began in 2009 with the launch of NASA's Kepler mission.

8
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Kepler's main scientific objective

9
0:00:48.08,000 --> 0:00:5,000
was to find planets outside of our solar system.

10
0:00:51.08,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It did this by staring at a single field in the sky,

11
0:00:54.68,000 --> 0:00:55,000
this one, with all the tiny boxes.

12
0:00:57.48,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And in this one field,

13
0:00:58.92,000 --> 0:01:02,000
it monitored the brightness of over 150,000 stars

14
0:01:03.36,000 --> 0:01:05,000
continuously for four years,

15
0:01:05.8,000 --> 0:01:07,000
taking a data point every 30 minutes.

16
0:01:10.48,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It was looking for what astronomers call a transit.

17
0:01:13.52,000 --> 0:01:18,000
This is when the planet's orbit is aligned in our line of sight,

18
0:01:18.56,000 --> 0:01:22,000
just so that the planet crosses in front of a star.

19
0:01:22.72,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And when this happens, it blocks out a tiny bit of starlight,

20
0:01:27.12,000 --> 0:01:29,000
which you can see as a dip in this curve.

21
0:01:31.6,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And so the team at NASA had developed very sophisticated computers

22
0:01:36.04,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to search for transits in all the Kepler data.

23
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
At the same time of the first data release,

24
0:01:44.08,000 --> 0:01:47,000
astronomers at Yale were wondering an interesting thing:

25
0:01:48.24,000 --> 0:01:51,000
What if computers missed something?

26
0:01:53.04,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And so we launched the citizen science project called Planet Hunters

27
0:01:57.76,000 --> 0:02:,000
to have people look at the same data.

28
0:02:01.6,000 --> 0:02:04,000
The human brain has an amazing ability for pattern recognition,

29
0:02:05.4,000 --> 0:02:07,000
sometimes even better than a computer.

30
0:02:07.64,000 --> 0:02:09,000
However, there was a lot of skepticism around this.

31
0:02:10.2,000 --> 0:02:13,000
My colleague, Debra Fischer, founder of the Planet Hunters project,

32
0:02:13.76,000 --> 0:02:14,000
said that people at the time were saying,

33
0:02:15.76,000 --> 0:02:18,000
"You're crazy. There's no way that a computer will miss a signal."

34
0:02:19.56,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And so it was on, the classic human versus machine gamble.

35
0:02:23.8,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And if we found one planet, we would be thrilled.

36
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
When I joined the team four years ago,

37
0:02:29.48,000 --> 0:02:3,000
we had already found a couple.

38
0:02:32.36,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And today, with the help of over 300,000 science enthusiasts,

39
0:02:37.04,000 --> 0:02:38,000
we have found dozens,

40
0:02:38.84,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and we've also found one of the most mysterious stars

41
0:02:42.12,000 --> 0:02:43,000
in our galaxy.

42
0:02:45.04,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So to understand this,

43
0:02:46.52,000 --> 0:02:49,000
let me show you what a normal transit in Kepler data looks like.

44
0:02:50.68,000 --> 0:02:53,000
On this graph on the left-hand side you have the amount of light,

45
0:02:54.08,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and on the bottom is time.

46
0:02:55.96,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The white line is light just from the star,

47
0:02:59.04,000 --> 0:03:01,000
what astronomers call a light curve.

48
0:03:01.44,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Now, when a planet transits a star, it blocks out a little bit of this light,

49
0:03:05.32,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and the depth of this transit reflects the size of the object itself.

50
0:03:10.8,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And so, for example, let's take Jupiter.

51
0:03:13.44,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Planets don't get much bigger than Jupiter.

52
0:03:15.6,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Jupiter will make a one percent drop in a star's brightness.

53
0:03:19.4,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Earth, on the other hand, is 11 times smaller than Jupiter,

54
0:03:23.6,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and the signal is barely visible in the data.

55
0:03:26.44,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So back to our mystery.

56
0:03:28.52,000 --> 0:03:31,000
A few years ago, Planet Hunters were sifting through data looking for transits,

57
0:03:33.2,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and they spotted a mysterious signal coming from the star KIC 8462852.

58
0:03:39.92,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The observations in May of 2009 were the first they spotted,

59
0:03:43.96,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and they started talking about this in the discussion forums.

60
0:03:47.32,000 --> 0:03:49,000
They said and object like Jupiter

61
0:03:49.44,000 --> 0:03:51,000
would make a drop like this in the star's light,

62
0:03:52.36,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but they were also saying it was giant.

63
0:03:55.72,000 --> 0:03:58,000
You see, transits normally only last for a few hours,

64
0:03:58.96,000 --> 0:04:,000
and this one lasted for almost a week.

65
0:04:01.88,000 --> 0:04:04,000
They were also saying that it looks asymmetric,

66
0:04:05.44,000 --> 0:04:09,000
meaning that instead of the clean, U-shaped dip that we saw with Jupiter,

67
0:04:09.72,000 --> 0:04:12,000
it had this strange slope that you can see on the left side.

68
0:04:13.24,000 --> 0:04:14,000
This seemed to indicate

69
0:04:14.6,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that whatever was getting in the way and blocking the starlight

70
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:19,000
was not circular like a planet.

71
0:04:21.24,000 --> 0:04:22,000
There are few more dips that happened,

72
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but for a couple of years, it was pretty quiet.

73
0:04:26.4,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And then in March of 2011, we see this.

74
0:04:31.12,000 --> 0:04:35,000
The star's light drops by a whole 15 percent,

75
0:04:35.24,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and this is huge compared to a planet,

76
0:04:37.44,000 --> 0:04:39,000
which would only make a one percent drop.

77
0:04:40.48,000 --> 0:04:43,000
We described this feature as both smooth and clean.

78
0:04:44.04,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It also is asymmetric,

79
0:04:46.08,000 --> 0:04:48,000
having a gradual dimming that lasts almost a week,

80
0:04:48.76,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and then it snaps right back up to normal in just a matter of days.

81
0:04:52.92,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And again, after this, not much happens

82
0:04:57.2,000 --> 0:05:,000
until February of 2013.

83
0:05:00.92,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Things start to get really crazy.

84
0:05:03.56,000 --> 0:05:07,000
There is a huge complex of dips in the light curve that appear,

85
0:05:08.08,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and they last for like a hundred days,

86
0:05:10.24,000 --> 0:05:12,000
all the way up into the Kepler mission's end.

87
0:05:13.28,000 --> 0:05:14,000
These dips have variable shapes.

88
0:05:15.28,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Some are very sharp, and some are broad,

89
0:05:17.52,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and they also have variable durations.

90
0:05:19.8,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Some last just for a day or two, and some for more than a week.

91
0:05:24.12,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And there's also up and down trends within some of these dips,

92
0:05:27.48,000 --> 0:05:31,000
almost like several independent events were superimposed on top of each other.

93
0:05:32.92,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And at this time, this star drops in its brightness over 20 percent.

94
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
This means that whatever is blocking its light

95
0:05:41.327,000 --> 0:05:45,000
has an area of over 1,000 times the area of our planet Earth.

96
0:05:46.2,000 --> 0:05:48,000
This is truly remarkable.

97
0:05:49.36,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And so the citizen scientists, when they saw this,

98
0:05:51.76,000 --> 0:05:54,000
they notified the science team that they found something weird enough

99
0:05:55.48,000 --> 0:05:57,000
that it might be worth following up.

100
0:05:58.68,000 --> 0:06:,000
And so when the science team looked at it,

101
0:06:00.76,000 --> 0:06:03,000
we're like, "Yeah, there's probably just something wrong with the data."

102
0:06:04.165,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But we looked really, really, really hard,

103
0:06:06.72,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and the data were good.

104
0:06:10.68,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And so what was happening had to be astrophysical,

105
0:06:13.8,000 --> 0:06:16,000
meaning that something in space was getting in the way

106
0:06:17.48,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and blocking starlight.

107
0:06:20.24,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And so at this point,

108
0:06:21.48,000 --> 0:06:23,000
we set out to learn everything we could about the star

109
0:06:24.08,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to see if we could find any clues to what was going on.

110
0:06:27.72,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And the citizen scientists who helped us in this discovery,

111
0:06:30.92,000 --> 0:06:31,000
they joined along for the ride

112
0:06:32.48,000 --> 0:06:35,000
watching science in action firsthand.

113
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:42,000
First, somebody said, you know, what if this star was very young

114
0:06:42.48,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and it still had the cloud of material it was born from surrounding it.

115
0:06:47.04,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And then somebody else said,

116
0:06:48.48,000 --> 0:06:5,000
well, what if the star had already formed planets,

117
0:06:51.28,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and two of these planets had collided,

118
0:06:53.52,000 --> 0:06:55,000
similar to the Earth-Moon forming event.

119
0:06:56.44,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Well, both of these theories could explain part of the data,

120
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:03,000
but the difficulties were that the star showed no signs of being young,

121
0:07:03.44,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and there was no glow from any of the material

122
0:07:06.4,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that was heated up by the star's light,

123
0:07:08.52,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and you would expect this if the star was young

124
0:07:11.4,000 --> 0:07:14,000
or if there was a collision and a lot of dust was produced.

125
0:07:15.8,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And so somebody else said,

126
0:07:17.44,000 --> 0:07:21,000
well, how about a huge swarm of comets

127
0:07:22.44,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that are passing by this star in a very elliptical orbit?

128
0:07:26.12,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Well, it ends up that this is actually consistent with our observations.

129
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But I agree, it does feel a little contrived.

130
0:07:35.28,000 --> 0:07:38,000
You see, it would take hundreds of comets

131
0:07:38.6,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to reproduce what we're observing.

132
0:07:41.2,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And these are only the comets

133
0:07:42.8,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that happen to pass between us and the star.

134
0:07:45.44,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And so in reality, we're talking thousands to tens of thousands of comets.

135
0:07:51.92,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But of all the bad ideas we had,

136
0:07:55.4,000 --> 0:07:57,000
this one was the best.

137
0:07:57.56,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And so we went ahead and published our findings.

138
0:08:00.52,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Now, let me tell you, this was one of the hardest papers I ever wrote.

139
0:08:04.76,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Scientists are meant to publish results,

140
0:08:07.12,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and this situation was far from that.

141
0:08:09.96,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And so we decided to give it a catchy title,

142
0:08:13.12,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and we called it: "Where's The Flux?"

143
0:08:15.32,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I will let you work out the acronym.

144
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Laughter)

145
0:08:22.84,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So this isn't the end of the story.

146
0:08:24.56,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Around the same time I was writing this paper,

147
0:08:26.76,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I met with a colleague of mine, Jason Wright,

148
0:08:28.92,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and he was also writing a paper on Kepler data.

149
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And he was saying that with Kepler's extreme precision,

150
0:08:35.36,000 --> 0:08:39,000
it could actually detect alien megastructures around stars,

151
0:08:40.24,000 --> 0:08:41,000
but it didn't.

152
0:08:42.52,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And then I showed him this weird data that our citizen scientists had found,

153
0:08:47.559,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and he said to me,

154
0:08:48.799,000 --> 0:08:49,000
"Aw crap, Tabby.

155
0:08:50.6,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Now I have to rewrite my paper."

156
0:08:54.44,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So yes, the natural explanations were weak,

157
0:08:58.48,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and we were curious now.

158
0:09:00.08,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So we had to find a way to rule out aliens.

159
0:09:03.28,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So together, we convinced a colleague of ours

160
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
who works on SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,

161
0:09:09.44,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that this would be an extraordinary target to pursue.

162
0:09:14.48,000 --> 0:09:16,000
We wrote a proposal to observe the star

163
0:09:16.88,000 --> 0:09:2,000
with the world's largest radio telescope at the Green Bank Observatory.

164
0:09:21.08,000 --> 0:09:22,000
A couple months later,

165
0:09:22.48,000 --> 0:09:26,000
news of this proposal got leaked to the press

166
0:09:27.76,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and now there are thousands of articles,

167
0:09:31.24,000 --> 0:09:34,000
over 10,000 articles, on this star alone.

168
0:09:34.4,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And if you search Google Images,

169
0:09:36.92,000 --> 0:09:37,000
this is what you'll find.

170
0:09:39.6,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Now, you may be wondering, OK, Tabby, well,

171
0:09:42.12,000 --> 0:09:45,000
how do aliens actually explain this light curve?

172
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:51,000
OK, well, imagine a civilization that's much more advanced than our own.

173
0:09:51.32,000 --> 0:09:53,000
In this hypothetical circumstance,

174
0:09:54.68,000 --> 0:09:58,000
this civilization would have exhausted the energy supply of their home planet,

175
0:09:59.36,000 --> 0:10:01,000
so where could they get more energy?

176
0:10:01.56,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Well, they have a host star just like we have a sun,

177
0:10:05.24,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and so if they were able to capture more energy from this star,

178
0:10:09.32,000 --> 0:10:1,000
then that would solve their energy needs.

179
0:10:11.8,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So they would go and build huge structures.

180
0:10:15.24,000 --> 0:10:17,000
These giant megastructures,

181
0:10:18.04,000 --> 0:10:21,000
like ginormous solar panels, are called Dyson spheres.

182
0:10:22.44,000 --> 0:10:23,000
This image above

183
0:10:23.76,000 --> 0:10:26,000
are lots of artists' impressions of Dyson spheres.

184
0:10:26.96,000 --> 0:10:31,000
It's really hard to provide perspective on the vastness of these things,

185
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:33,000
but you can think of it this way.

186
0:10:33.84,000 --> 0:10:36,000
The Earth-Moon distance is a quarter of a million miles.

187
0:10:38.04,000 --> 0:10:41,000
The simplest element on one of these structures

188
0:10:41.96,000 --> 0:10:43,000
is 100 times that size.

189
0:10:45.4,000 --> 0:10:46,000
They're enormous.

190
0:10:48.08,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And now imagine one of these structures in motion around a star.

191
0:10:52.52,000 --> 0:10:55,000
You can see how it would produce anomalies in the data

192
0:10:55.64,000 --> 0:10:58,000
such as uneven, unnatural looking dips.

193
0:10:58.88,000 --> 0:11:01,000
But it remains that even alien megastructures

194
0:11:02.88,000 --> 0:11:04,000
cannot defy the laws of physics.

195
0:11:05.32,000 --> 0:11:08,000
You see, anything that uses a lot of energy

196
0:11:09.8,000 --> 0:11:1,000
is going to produce heat,

197
0:11:12.84,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and we don't observe this.

198
0:11:14.84,000 --> 0:11:15,000
But it could be something as simple

199
0:11:16.56,000 --> 0:11:19,000
as they're just reradiating it away in another direction,

200
0:11:20.04,000 --> 0:11:21,000
just not at Earth.

201
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Another idea that's one of my personal favorites

202
0:11:26.32,000 --> 0:11:29,000
is that we had just witnessed an interplanetary space battle

203
0:11:30.12,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and the catastrophic destruction of a planet.

204
0:11:34.52,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Now, I admit that this would produce a lot of dust

205
0:11:37.8,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that we don't observe.

206
0:11:39.72,000 --> 0:11:43,000
But if we're already invoking aliens in this explanation,

207
0:11:44.08,000 --> 0:11:47,000
then who is to say they didn't efficiently clean up all this mess

208
0:11:47.8,000 --> 0:11:48,000
for recycling purposes?

209
0:11:49.36,000 --> 0:11:5,000
(Laughter)

210
0:11:50.4,000 --> 0:11:52,000
You can see how this quickly captures your imagination.

211
0:11:55.76,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Well, there you have it.

212
0:11:57.04,000 --> 0:12:,000
We're in a situation that could unfold

213
0:12:00.28,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to be a natural phenomenon we don't understand

214
0:12:03.72,000 --> 0:12:05,000
or an alien technology we don't understand.

215
0:12:07.6,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Personally, as a scientist, my money is on the natural explanation.

216
0:12:14.04,000 --> 0:12:17,000
But don't get me wrong, I do think it would be awesome to find aliens.

217
0:12:18.8,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Either way, there is something new and really interesting to discover.

218
0:12:24.04,000 --> 0:12:25,000
So what happens next?

219
0:12:25.92,000 --> 0:12:27,000
We need to continue to observe this star

220
0:12:28.6,000 --> 0:12:3,000
to learn more about what's happening.

221
0:12:31.04,000 --> 0:12:33,000
But professional astronomers, like me,

222
0:12:33.64,000 --> 0:12:35,000
we have limited resources for this kind of thing,

223
0:12:36.48,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and Kepler is on to a different mission.

224
0:12:39.4,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And I'm happy to say that once again,

225
0:12:43.64,000 --> 0:12:46,000
citizen scientists have come in and saved the day.

226
0:12:47.88,000 --> 0:12:49,000
You see, this time,

227
0:12:50.36,000 --> 0:12:52,000
amateur astronomers with their backyard telescopes

228
0:12:54.12,000 --> 0:12:57,000
stepped up immediately and started observing this star nightly

229
0:12:58.12,000 --> 0:12:59,000
at their own facilities,

230
0:12:59.64,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and I am so excited to see what they find.

231
0:13:03.52,000 --> 0:13:07,000
What's amazing to me is that this star would have never been found by computers

232
0:13:07.72,000 --> 0:13:09,000
because we just weren't looking for something like this.

233
0:13:11.4,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And what's more exciting

234
0:13:15.68,000 --> 0:13:16,000
is that there's more data to come.

235
0:13:18.2,000 --> 0:13:19,000
There are new missions that are coming up

236
0:13:20.2,000 --> 0:13:22,000
that are observing millions more stars

237
0:13:23.84,000 --> 0:13:24,000
all over the sky.

238
0:13:26.28,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And just think: What will it mean when we find another star like this?

239
0:13:32.52,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And what will it mean if we don't find another star like this?

240
0:13:37.28,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Thank you.

241
0:13:38.52,000 --> 0:13:44,000
(Applause)

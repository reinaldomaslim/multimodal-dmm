1
0:00:13.734,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Guys, we have an issue.

2
0:00:16.294,000 --> 0:00:17,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:17.416,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Growth is fading away, and it's a big deal.

4
0:00:21.136,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Our global economy stops growing.

5
0:00:24.018,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And it's not new.

6
0:00:25.441,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Growth has actually declined for the last 50 years.

7
0:00:29.213,000 --> 0:00:31,000
If we continue like this, we need to learn

8
0:00:31.777,000 --> 0:00:34,000
how to live in a world with no growth in the next decade.

9
0:00:36.249,000 --> 0:00:39,000
This is scary because when the economy doesn't grow,

10
0:00:39.75,000 --> 0:00:4,000
our children don't get better lives.

11
0:00:42.535,000 --> 0:00:45,000
What's even scarier is that when the pie does not grow,

12
0:00:45.972,000 --> 0:00:46,000
each of us get a smaller piece.

13
0:00:47.552,000 --> 0:00:49,000
We're then ready to fight for a bigger one.

14
0:00:50.07,000 --> 0:00:53,000
This creates tensions and serious conflicts.

15
0:00:53.585,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Growth matters a lot.

16
0:00:57.35,000 --> 0:00:59,000
If we look at the history of growth,

17
0:00:59.662,000 --> 0:01:01,000
times of big growth have always been fueled

18
0:01:02.198,000 --> 0:01:04,000
by big manufacturing revolutions.

19
0:01:04.818,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It happened three times, every 50-60 years.

20
0:01:08.419,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The steam engine in the middle of the 19th century,

21
0:01:12.467,000 --> 0:01:15,000
the mass-production model in the beginning of the 20th century --

22
0:01:16.252,000 --> 0:01:17,000
thanks, Mr. Ford.

23
0:01:18.384,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And the first automation wave in the 1970s.

24
0:01:22.157,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Why did these manufacturing revolutions

25
0:01:24.377,000 --> 0:01:26,000
create huge growth in our economies?

26
0:01:27.677,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Because they have injected huge productivity improvement.

27
0:01:31.591,000 --> 0:01:32,000
It's rather simple:

28
0:01:33.08,000 --> 0:01:36,000
in order to grow, you need to be producing more,

29
0:01:36.339,000 --> 0:01:37,000
putting more into our economy.

30
0:01:39.241,000 --> 0:01:44,000
This means either more labor or more capital or more productivity.

31
0:01:44.877,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Each time, productivity has been the growth lever.

32
0:01:49.744,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I'm here today to tell you

33
0:01:52.511,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that we are on the verge of another huge change,

34
0:01:56.245,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and that this change, surprisingly enough,

35
0:01:59.731,000 --> 0:02:01,000
is going to come from manufacturing, again.

36
0:02:03.394,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It will get us out of our growth slump

37
0:02:06.526,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and it will change radically the way globalization has been shaped

38
0:02:10.394,000 --> 0:02:11,000
over the last decade.

39
0:02:11.935,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I'm here to tell you about the amazing fourth manufacturing revolution

40
0:02:17.23,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that is currently underway.

41
0:02:19.213,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It's not as if we've done nothing with manufacturing

42
0:02:21.698,000 --> 0:02:22,000
since the last revolution.

43
0:02:23.011,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Actually, we've made some pretty lame attempts

44
0:02:25.45,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to try to revitalize it.

45
0:02:27.075,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But none of them have been the big overhaul

46
0:02:30.076,000 --> 0:02:31,000
we really need to get us growing again.

47
0:02:32.384,000 --> 0:02:36,000
For example, we've tried to relocate our factories offshore

48
0:02:37.002,000 --> 0:02:4,000
in order to reduce cost and take advantage of cheap labor.

49
0:02:41.048,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Not only did this not inspire productivity,

50
0:02:44.655,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but it only saved money for a short period of time,

51
0:02:47.151,000 --> 0:02:49,000
because cheap labor didn't stay cheap for long.

52
0:02:50.455,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Then, we've tried to make our factories larger

53
0:02:54.401,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and we specialized them by product.

54
0:02:57.318,000 --> 0:03:,000
The idea was that we can make a lot of one product

55
0:03:00.655,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and stockpile it to be sold with demand.

56
0:03:04.022,000 --> 0:03:06,000
This did help productivity for a while.

57
0:03:06.625,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But it introduced a lot of rigidities in our supply chain.

58
0:03:11.432,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Let's take fashion retail.

59
0:03:13.232,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Traditional clothing companies

60
0:03:15.374,000 --> 0:03:19,000
have built offshore, global, rigid supply chains.

61
0:03:20.787,000 --> 0:03:22,000
When fast-fashion competitors like Zara

62
0:03:23.562,000 --> 0:03:25,000
started replenishing their stocks faster

63
0:03:26.097,000 --> 0:03:29,000
from two collections a year to one collection a month,

64
0:03:29.8,000 --> 0:03:31,000
none of them have been able to keep up with the pace.

65
0:03:32.368,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Most of them are in great difficulties today.

66
0:03:36.008,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Yet, with all of their shortcomings,

67
0:03:39.236,000 --> 0:03:4,000
those are the factories we know today.

68
0:03:41.539,000 --> 0:03:42,000
When you open the doors,

69
0:03:43.181,000 --> 0:03:45,000
they look the same as they did 50 years ago.

70
0:03:46.396,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We've just changed the location, the size, the way they operate.

71
0:03:52.273,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Can you name anything else that looks the same

72
0:03:54.641,000 --> 0:03:55,000
as it did 50 years ago?

73
0:03:56.22,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It's crazy.

74
0:03:57.836,000 --> 0:04:,000
We've made all the tweaks to the model that we could,

75
0:04:00.892,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and now we hit its limits.

76
0:04:05.032,000 --> 0:04:09,000
After all of our attempts to fix the manufacturing model failed,

77
0:04:09.893,000 --> 0:04:11,000
we thought growth could come from elsewhere.

78
0:04:12.722,000 --> 0:04:14,000
We turned to the tech sector --

79
0:04:14.786,000 --> 0:04:16,000
there's been quite a lot of innovations there.

80
0:04:17.178,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Just to name one: the Internet.

81
0:04:19.906,000 --> 0:04:2,000
We hoped it could produce growth.

82
0:04:21.735,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And indeed, it changed our lives.

83
0:04:24.251,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It made big waves in the media, the service, the entertainment spaces.

84
0:04:29.081,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But it hasn't done much for productivity.

85
0:04:32.011,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Actually, what's surprising is that productivity is on the decline

86
0:04:36.331,000 --> 0:04:38,000
despite all of those innovation efforts.

87
0:04:39.523,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Imagine that -- sitting at work, scrolling through Facebook,

88
0:04:43.305,000 --> 0:04:46,000
watching videos on YouTube has made us less productive.

89
0:04:47.133,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Weird.

90
0:04:48.308,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:49.916,000 --> 0:04:5,000
This is why we are not growing.

92
0:04:52.58,000 --> 0:04:55,000
We failed at reinventing the manufacturing space,

93
0:04:55.88,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and large technological innovations have played away from it.

94
0:05:01.184,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But what if we could combine those forces?

95
0:05:03.927,000 --> 0:05:07,000
What if the existing manufacturing and large technological innovation

96
0:05:08.819,000 --> 0:05:12,000
came together to create the next big manufacturing reinvention.

97
0:05:13.406,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Bingo!

98
0:05:14.688,000 --> 0:05:16,000
This is the fourth manufacturing revolution,

99
0:05:17.195,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and it's happening right now.

100
0:05:19.355,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Major technologies are entering the manufacturing space,

101
0:05:22.645,000 --> 0:05:23,000
big time.

102
0:05:24.316,000 --> 0:05:27,000
They will boost industrial productivity by more than a third.

103
0:05:28.217,000 --> 0:05:31,000
This is massive, and it will do a lot in creating growth.

104
0:05:33.286,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Let me tell you about some of them.

105
0:05:36.091,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Have you already met advanced manufacturing robots?

106
0:05:39.583,000 --> 0:05:41,000
They are the size of humans,

107
0:05:41.702,000 --> 0:05:43,000
they actually collaborate with them,

108
0:05:43.747,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and they can be programmed

109
0:05:45.35,000 --> 0:05:47,000
in order to perform complex, non-repetitive tasks.

110
0:05:49.628,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Today in our factories, only 8 percent of the tasks are automated.

111
0:05:54.59,000 --> 0:05:57,000
The less complex, the more repetitive ones.

112
0:05:58.551,000 --> 0:06:,000
It will be 25 percent in 10 years.

113
0:06:01.452,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It means that by 2025,

114
0:06:04.289,000 --> 0:06:06,000
advanced robots will complement workers

115
0:06:06.877,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to be, together, 20 percent more productive,

116
0:06:09.744,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to manufacture 20 percent more outputs,

117
0:06:11.769,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to achieve 20 percent additional growth.

118
0:06:15.118,000 --> 0:06:17,000
This isn't some fancy, futuristic idea.

119
0:06:18.425,000 --> 0:06:2,000
These robots are working for us right now.

120
0:06:21.993,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Last year in the US, they helped Amazon prepare and ship all the products

121
0:06:27.563,000 --> 0:06:29,000
required for Cyber Monday,

122
0:06:29.681,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the annual peak of online retail.

123
0:06:32.401,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Last year in the US,

124
0:06:34.049,000 --> 0:06:39,000
it was the biggest online shopping day of the year and of history.

125
0:06:40.626,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Consumers spent 3 billion dollars on electronics that day.

126
0:06:44.276,000 --> 0:06:46,000
That's real economic growth.

127
0:06:47.502,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Then there's additive manufacturing, 3D printing.

128
0:06:51.574,000 --> 0:06:55,000
3D printing has already improved plastic manufacturing

129
0:06:55.606,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and it's now making its way through metal.

130
0:06:58.614,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Those are not small industries.

131
0:07:00.875,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Plastic and metals represent 25 percent

132
0:07:03.915,000 --> 0:07:05,000
of global manufacturing production.

133
0:07:06.717,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Let's take a real example.

134
0:07:09.005,000 --> 0:07:11,000
In the aerospace industry,

135
0:07:11.967,000 --> 0:07:15,000
fuel nozzles are some of the most complex parts to manufacture,

136
0:07:16.484,000 --> 0:07:17,000
for one reason:

137
0:07:17.806,000 --> 0:07:2,000
they are made up of 20 different parts

138
0:07:21.019,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that need to be separately produced

139
0:07:23.854,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and then painstakingly assembled.

140
0:07:27.301,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Aerospace companies are now using 3D printing,

141
0:07:30.451,000 --> 0:07:33,000
which allows them to turn those 20 different parts

142
0:07:33.539,000 --> 0:07:34,000
into just one.

143
0:07:35.368,000 --> 0:07:36,000
The results?

144
0:07:36.909,000 --> 0:07:38,000
40 percent more productivity,

145
0:07:39.269,000 --> 0:07:42,000
40 percent more output produced, 40 percent more growth

146
0:07:42.56,000 --> 0:07:43,000
for this specific industry.

147
0:07:45.283,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But actually, the most exciting part of this new manufacturing revolution

148
0:07:51.457,000 --> 0:07:53,000
goes much beyond productivity.

149
0:07:54.692,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It's about producing better, smarter products.

150
0:07:58.287,000 --> 0:08:,000
It's about scale customization.

151
0:08:01.099,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Imagine a world where you can buy the exact products you want

152
0:08:05.858,000 --> 0:08:07,000
with the functionalities you need,

153
0:08:08.092,000 --> 0:08:09,000
with the design you want,

154
0:08:10.064,000 --> 0:08:11,000
with the same cost and lead time

155
0:08:11.674,000 --> 0:08:12,000
as a product that's been mass produced,

156
0:08:13.58,000 --> 0:08:15,000
like your car, or your clothes or your cell phone.

157
0:08:17.113,000 --> 0:08:19,000
The new manufacturing revolution makes it possible.

158
0:08:20.577,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Advanced robots can be programmed

159
0:08:23.422,000 --> 0:08:26,000
in order to perform any product configuration

160
0:08:26.565,000 --> 0:08:28,000
without any setup time or ramp up.

161
0:08:29.791,000 --> 0:08:34,000
3D printers instantaneously produce any customized design.

162
0:08:35.675,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We are now able to produce a batch of one product, your product,

163
0:08:41.368,000 --> 0:08:44,000
at the same cost and lead time as a batch of many.

164
0:08:45.629,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Those are only a few examples of the manufacturing revolution at play.

165
0:08:50.468,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Not only will manufacturing become more productive,

166
0:08:54.579,000 --> 0:08:56,000
it will also become more flexible,

167
0:08:57.538,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and those were exactly the elements of growth that we are missing.

168
0:09:03.106,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But actually, there are even some bigger implications

169
0:09:06.748,000 --> 0:09:11,000
for all of us when manufacturing will find its way back into the limelight.

170
0:09:12.441,000 --> 0:09:15,000
It will create a huge macroeconomic shift.

171
0:09:16.683,000 --> 0:09:2,000
First, our factories will be relocated into our home markets.

172
0:09:21.877,000 --> 0:09:23,000
In the world of scale customization,

173
0:09:24.144,000 --> 0:09:26,000
consumer proximity is the new norm.

174
0:09:27.722,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Then, our factories will be smaller, agile.

175
0:09:31.918,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Scale does not matter anymore, flexibility does.

176
0:09:35.802,000 --> 0:09:38,000
They will be operating on a multi-product, made-to-order basis.

177
0:09:39.859,000 --> 0:09:41,000
The change will be drastic.

178
0:09:42.59,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Globalization will enter a new era.

179
0:09:47.145,000 --> 0:09:49,000
The East-to-West trade flows

180
0:09:50.084,000 --> 0:09:52,000
will be replaced by regional trade flows.

181
0:09:52.789,000 --> 0:09:54,000
East for East, West for West.

182
0:09:55.687,000 --> 0:09:56,000
When you think about that,

183
0:09:57.884,000 --> 0:09:59,000
the old model was pretty much insane.

184
0:10:01.065,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Piling up stocks, making products travel the whole world

185
0:10:04.84,000 --> 0:10:05,000
before they reach their end consumers.

186
0:10:06.743,000 --> 0:10:1,000
The new model, producing just next to the consumer market,

187
0:10:11.007,000 --> 0:10:15,000
will be much cleaner, much better for our environment.

188
0:10:16.678,000 --> 0:10:19,000
In mature economies, manufacturing will be back home,

189
0:10:20.487,000 --> 0:10:22,000
creating more employment,

190
0:10:22.587,000 --> 0:10:24,000
more productivity and more growth.

191
0:10:25.93,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Good news, isn't it?

192
0:10:28.541,000 --> 0:10:29,000
But here's the thing with growth --

193
0:10:30.37,000 --> 0:10:31,000
it does not come automatically.

194
0:10:32.328,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Mature economies will have to seize it.

195
0:10:35.196,000 --> 0:10:37,000
We'll have to massively re-train our workforce.

196
0:10:38.547,000 --> 0:10:4,000
In most countries, like in my country, France,

197
0:10:41.231,000 --> 0:10:44,000
we've told our children that manufacturing had no future.

198
0:10:44.357,000 --> 0:10:45,000
That it was something happening far away.

199
0:10:46.358,000 --> 0:10:47,000
We need to reverse that

200
0:10:48.18,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and teach manufacturing again at university.

201
0:10:51.203,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Only the countries that will boldly transform

202
0:10:54.712,000 --> 0:10:56,000
will be able to seize this growth.

203
0:10:58.64,000 --> 0:11:,000
It's also a chance for developing economies.

204
0:11:02.461,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Of course China and other emerging economies

205
0:11:06.118,000 --> 0:11:08,000
won't be the factory of the world anymore.

206
0:11:09.545,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Actually, it was not a sustainable model in the long term,

207
0:11:14.187,000 --> 0:11:16,000
as those countries are becoming richer.

208
0:11:17.779,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Last year, it was already as expensive to produce in Brazil

209
0:11:22.827,000 --> 0:11:23,000
as to produce in France.

210
0:11:26.184,000 --> 0:11:31,000
By 2018, manufacturing costs in China will be on par with the US.

211
0:11:33.35,000 --> 0:11:35,000
The new manufacturing revolution

212
0:11:35.625,000 --> 0:11:39,000
will accelerate the transition of those emerging economies

213
0:11:40.429,000 --> 0:11:43,000
towards a model driven by domestic consumption.

214
0:11:43.675,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And this is good,

215
0:11:44.876,000 --> 0:11:46,000
because this is where growth will be created.

216
0:11:47.915,000 --> 0:11:48,000
In the next five years,

217
0:11:49.543,000 --> 0:11:54,000
the next billion consumers in China will inject more growth in our economies

218
0:11:54.871,000 --> 0:11:56,000
than the top five European markets together.

219
0:11:59.944,000 --> 0:12:03,000
This fourth manufacturing revolution is a chance for all of us.

220
0:12:05.046,000 --> 0:12:06,000
If we play it right,

221
0:12:07.024,000 --> 0:12:1,000
we'll see sustainable growth in all of our economies.

222
0:12:10.969,000 --> 0:12:13,000
This means more wealth distributed to all of us

223
0:12:14.658,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and a better future for our children.

224
0:12:17.189,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Thank you.

225
0:12:18.374,000 --> 0:12:25,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm Dr. David Hanson, and I build robots with character.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And by that, I mean

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that I develop robots that are characters,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but also robots that will eventually

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
come to empathize with you.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So we're starting with a variety of technologies

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that have converged into these conversational character robots

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that can see faces, make eye contact with you,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
make a full range of facial expressions, understand speech

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and begin to model how you're feeling

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and who you are, and build a relationship with you.

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I developed a series of technologies

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
than previously achieved, on lower power,

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
which enabled the walking biped robots, the first androids.

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So, it's a full range of facial expressions

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
simulating all the major muscles in the human face,

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
running on very small batteries,

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
extremely lightweight.

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
The materials that allowed the battery-operated facial expressions

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
is a material that we call Frubber,

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and it actually has three major innovations

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in the material that allow this to happen.

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
One is hierarchical pores,

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material.

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
There he's starting to walk.

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I built the head. They built the body.

29
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines,

30
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and not just sentience, but empathy.

31
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
We're working with the Machine Perception Laboratory

32
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
at the U.C. San Diego.

33
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
They have this really remarkable facial expression technology

34
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that recognizes facial expressions,

35
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
what facial expressions you're making.

36
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
It also recognizes where you're looking, your head orientation.

37
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
We're emulating all the major facial expressions,

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and then controlling it with the software

39
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that we call the Character Engine.

40
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And here is a little bit of the technology that's involved in that.

41
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
In fact, right now -- plug it from here, and then plug it in here,

42
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and now let's see if it gets my facial expressions.

43
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Okay. So I'm smiling.

44
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Now I'm frowning.

46
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And this is really heavily backlit.

47
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Okay, here we go.

48
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Oh, it's so sad.

49
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Okay, so you smile, frowning.

50
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So his perception of your emotional states

51
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic.

52
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Machines are becoming devastatingly capable

53
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
of things like killing. Right?

54
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Those machines have no place for empathy.

55
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And there is billions of dollars being spent on that.

56
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Character robotics could plant the seed

57
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
for robots that actually have empathy.

58
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So, if they achieve human level intelligence

59
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
or, quite possibly, greater than human levels of intelligence,

60
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
this could be the seeds of hope for our future.

61
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So, we've made 20 robots in the last eight years, during the course of getting my Ph.D.

62
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And then I started Hanson Robotics,

63
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing.

64
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
This is one of our robots

65
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago.

66
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And it sees multiple people in a scene,

67
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
remembers where individual people are,

68
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and looks from person to person, remembering people.

69
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So, we're involving two things.

70
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
One, the perception of people,

71
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and two, the natural interface,

72
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
the natural form of the interface,

73
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
so that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot.

74
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
You start to believe that it's alive and aware.

75
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together

76
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in an artistic display of an android portrait

77
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
of science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick,

78
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
who wrote great works like, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"

79
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
which was the basis of the movie "Bladerunner."

80
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
In these stories, robots often think

81
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that they're human, and they sort of come to life.

82
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So we put his writings, letters,

83
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
his interviews, correspondences,

84
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
into a huge database of thousands of pages,

85
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and then used some natural language processing

86
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to allow you to actually have a conversation with him.

87
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And it was kind of spooky, because he would say these things

88
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that just sounded like they really understood you.

89
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And this is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing,

90
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
which is a little character that's a spokesbot

91
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
for friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence.

92
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And we're getting this mass-manufactured.

93
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
We specked it out to actually be doable

94
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
with a very, very low-cost bill of materials,

95
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
so that it can become a childhood companion for kids.

96
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Interfacing with the Internet, it gets smarter over the years.

97
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
As artificial intelligence evolves, so does his intelligence.

98
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. That's incredible.

99
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Applause)

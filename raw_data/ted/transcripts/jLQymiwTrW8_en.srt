1
0:00:11.369,000 --> 0:00:17,000
this is the most precious mind-opening

2
0:00:15.359,000 --> 0:00:21,000
mind-blowing experience I've ever had

3
0:00:17.41,000 --> 0:00:24,000
it's like one week you meet tons of

4
0:00:22.3,000 --> 0:00:27,000
people who are doing amazing things

5
0:00:24.91,000 --> 0:00:29,000
across the globe ted is about bringing

6
0:00:27.519,000 --> 0:00:32,000
together not only a variety of

7
0:00:30.749,000 --> 0:00:35,000
disciplines and approaches to

8
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
transforming the world it's about the

9
0:00:36.67,000 --> 0:00:4,000
diversity of people that get to come all

10
0:00:39.159,000 --> 0:00:43,000
these amazing ingredients and raw

11
0:00:41.469,000 --> 0:00:45,000
ingredients and raw ideas are just

12
0:00:43.6,000 --> 0:00:47,000
thrown in together and it's going to be

13
0:00:45.579,000 --> 0:00:51,000
presented or come out in this wonderful

14
0:00:48.239,000 --> 0:00:54,000
flavorful nourishing there's it's been

15
0:00:52.57,000 --> 0:00:58,000
emotional it's been inspiring it's been

16
0:00:54.899,000 --> 0:01:,000
curiosity driven and just kind of food

17
0:00:58.719,000 --> 0:01:02,000
for the brain you kind of see the future

18
0:01:01.51,000 --> 0:01:05,000
in sort of pull it towards the present

19
0:01:03.399,000 --> 0:01:08,000
you know with both hands that that's

20
0:01:05.56,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that's what Ted does

21
0:01:26.479,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Ted originally stood for Technology

22
0:01:28.82,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Entertainment and design but since then

23
0:01:31.28,000 --> 0:01:37,000
we've expanded out to science humanities

24
0:01:34.159,000 --> 0:01:39,000
the arts NGOs and business first and

25
0:01:38.24,000 --> 0:01:41,000
foremost Ted is a place where people

26
0:01:40.1,000 --> 0:01:45,000
share ideas they're very giving of

27
0:01:42.229,000 --> 0:01:46,000
knowledge of passion of just vision it's

28
0:01:45.319,000 --> 0:01:48,000
connecting people I think whatever you

29
0:01:46.759,000 --> 0:01:49,000
do I mean to cut the caliber of people

30
0:01:48.649,000 --> 0:01:52,000
who here are successful because I have a

31
0:01:50.39,000 --> 0:01:54,000
certain focus and at a concentration and

32
0:01:52.88,000 --> 0:01:56,000
you could be in your own bubble plowing

33
0:01:54.799,000 --> 0:01:58,000
the same fields and suddenly you is that

34
0:01:57.02,000 --> 0:02:01,000
bubble burst and you expand into all

35
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:03,000
these other areas and see parallels even

36
0:02:01.759,000 --> 0:02:03,000
though you might be from very different

37
0:02:03.17,000 --> 0:02:06,000
disciplines

38
0:02:03.92,000 --> 0:02:08,000
what's cool about Ted is as you see an

39
0:02:06.799,000 --> 0:02:11,000
unfolding sequence of these people one

40
0:02:09.56,000 --> 0:02:13,000
after the other the connections between

41
0:02:11.84,000 --> 0:02:15,000
them start to become apparent it's

42
0:02:13.819,000 --> 0:02:17,000
incredible just to spot themes parallel

43
0:02:16.22,000 --> 0:02:19,000
themes and you can see like that matches

44
0:02:18.59,000 --> 0:02:2,000
what I do or that matches what they do

45
0:02:19.88,000 --> 0:02:22,000
maybe we should get together and just

46
0:02:21.11,000 --> 0:02:25,000
even talking about things spreading

47
0:02:23.239,000 --> 0:02:29,000
ideas you know ideas worth spreading is

48
0:02:25.79,000 --> 0:02:3,000
not a bad slogan to have we've added a

49
0:02:29.45,000 --> 0:02:33,000
new international Fellows program that

50
0:02:31.489,000 --> 0:02:36,000
we call Ted fellows that brings together

51
0:02:34.329,000 --> 0:02:38,000
extraordinary individuals from around

52
0:02:36.56,000 --> 0:02:4,000
the world to participate in the Ted

53
0:02:39.29,000 --> 0:02:43,000
community both by coming to conferences

54
0:02:41.51,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and being part of an ongoing social

55
0:02:43.85,000 --> 0:02:48,000
network throughout the year the Fellows

56
0:02:45.829,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Program allows a kind of a seedling

57
0:02:49.34,000 --> 0:02:54,000
process to go on and cultivate and

58
0:02:51.92,000 --> 0:02:56,000
sustains the the kind of passion and

59
0:02:55.1,000 --> 0:02:58,000
firing because there was something about

60
0:02:56.93,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Ted it was getting to be a place where

61
0:02:58.43,000 --> 0:03:02,000
already brilliant people met other

62
0:03:00.47,000 --> 0:03:04,000
already brilliant people too yeah and

63
0:03:02.9,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and if you're not already brilliant well

64
0:03:04.73,000 --> 0:03:09,000
you know so there was no process whereby

65
0:03:06.829,000 --> 0:03:11,000
you could be nurtured mentored and grow

66
0:03:10.22,000 --> 0:03:14,000
along with the group the TED Fellows

67
0:03:12.47,000 --> 0:03:15,000
program is focusing on attracting

68
0:03:14.54,000 --> 0:03:2,000
candidates from five parts of the world

69
0:03:16.34,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Asia Pacific Africa the Caribbean Latin

70
0:03:20.599,000 --> 0:03:23,000
America and the Middle East all the

71
0:03:22.31,000 --> 0:03:25,000
people from the rest

72
0:03:24.04,000 --> 0:03:27,000
the world are welcome to apply we're

73
0:03:25.9,000 --> 0:03:29,000
also searching for candidates who are 21

74
0:03:27.939,000 --> 0:03:31,000
to 40 years old although once again

75
0:03:30.01,000 --> 0:03:34,000
anyone 18 years and older is also

76
0:03:32.799,000 --> 0:03:37,000
welcome to apply we're looking for

77
0:03:34.75,000 --> 0:03:39,000
makers and doers not just talkers or not

78
0:03:37.9,000 --> 0:03:41,000
just people that amazing potential we

79
0:03:40.599,000 --> 0:03:44,000
want to see someone that's already done

80
0:03:42.31,000 --> 0:03:47,000
something extraordinary and that we see

81
0:03:45.01,000 --> 0:03:5,000
a trajectory for them to increase the

82
0:03:47.859,000 --> 0:03:51,000
effectiveness of whatever endeavor they

83
0:03:50.17,000 --> 0:03:55,000
are studying or pursuing at dead I

84
0:03:52.84,000 --> 0:03:57,000
believe they're showing us the

85
0:03:55.93,000 --> 0:03:59,000
opportunities and I could take that

86
0:03:58.03,000 --> 0:04:03,000
learning back and show others what

87
0:04:00.549,000 --> 0:04:05,000
opportunities do exist so that they can

88
0:04:03.849,000 --> 0:04:07,000
move forward there's the incredible

89
0:04:05.68,000 --> 0:04:09,000
community of people who genuinely want

90
0:04:07.959,000 --> 0:04:1,000
to see these fellows thrive so whether

91
0:04:10.419,000 --> 0:04:13,000
they're wealthy or incredibly

92
0:04:11.889,000 --> 0:04:15,000
accomplished or whether they want a

93
0:04:13.72,000 --> 0:04:17,000
mentor or coach this community is coming

94
0:04:16.419,000 --> 0:04:19,000
together around the TED Fellows and

95
0:04:17.859,000 --> 0:04:22,000
volunteering to help the Fellows program

96
0:04:20.38,000 --> 0:04:25,000
was funded by people who didn't need to

97
0:04:23.169,000 --> 0:04:28,000
care about us they just could have come

98
0:04:26.08,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to Ted and enjoy Ted with all the

99
0:04:28.18,000 --> 0:04:33,000
wonderful people they didn't need to

100
0:04:30.61,000 --> 0:04:34,000
care they you know they just took their

101
0:04:33.49,000 --> 0:04:37,000
attention they look at us they said

102
0:04:35.289,000 --> 0:04:4,000
these people are worth something maybe

103
0:04:37.99,000 --> 0:04:41,000
we should listen to them and they set up

104
0:04:40.63,000 --> 0:04:45,000
this wonderful show this wonderful

105
0:04:42.669,000 --> 0:04:48,000
program and we are here and they are

106
0:04:46.12,000 --> 0:04:5,000
thanking us for being here one of the

107
0:04:48.82,000 --> 0:04:51,000
most powerful ways in which we can help

108
0:04:50.8,000 --> 0:04:54,000
the Ted fellows is offering them the

109
0:04:52.72,000 --> 0:04:57,000
platform of Ted calm in addition to

110
0:04:55.69,000 --> 0:05:,000
putting up a directory of their profiles

111
0:04:58.09,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and letting them blog in a continuous

112
0:05:01.21,000 --> 0:05:06,000
narrative on the Ted fellows blog we

113
0:05:04.15,000 --> 0:05:1,000
also offer them the opportunity to speak

114
0:05:06.76,000 --> 0:05:11,000
at Ted record what they say and then put

115
0:05:10.3,000 --> 0:05:13,000
it up on Ted comm where they will reach

116
0:05:12.55,000 --> 0:05:15,000
an audience much larger than they've

117
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
ever reached before

118
0:05:15.76,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I am in love with the pit talks and I

119
0:05:18.4,000 --> 0:05:23,000
mean like I try to watch one a week and

120
0:05:21.43,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I use them in my anthropology courses

121
0:05:23.59,000 --> 0:05:29,000
all the time I've never seen something

122
0:05:27.07,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that's so palpable the students make

123
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
them feel connected to the world beyond

124
0:05:32.89,000 --> 0:05:38,000
the classroom so readily I really want

125
0:05:36.04,000 --> 0:05:42,000
to be as present and engaged as possible

126
0:05:39.55,000 --> 0:05:47,000
as I can as just a student of life here

127
0:05:43.03,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I won't meet mentors and teachers like

128
0:05:48.13,000 --> 0:05:51,000
this all at one fell swoop in a nutshell

129
0:05:51.13,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Ted

130
0:05:52.03,000 --> 0:05:59,000
is four days of intellectual stimulation

131
0:05:56.34,000 --> 0:06:,000
creativity conversations and some of the

132
0:05:59.56,000 --> 0:06:03,000
best talks you've ever seen in your life

133
0:06:01.06,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that literally leave your brain ready to

134
0:06:04.12,000 --> 0:06:09,000
explode with all the new creative

135
0:06:06.43,000 --> 0:06:11,000
connections that inspired you to go back

136
0:06:09.28,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to your own work with great new ideas

137
0:06:11.44,000 --> 0:06:16,000
great new creativity and a renewed sense

138
0:06:15.01,000 --> 0:06:18,000
of optimism and hope about the world

139
0:06:17.02,000 --> 0:06:19,000
it's like what Einstein said when you

140
0:06:18.76,000 --> 0:06:2,000
think differently

141
0:06:19.75,000 --> 0:06:22,000
you know different things but you need a

142
0:06:21.43,000 --> 0:06:25,000
different way of thinking if you want

143
0:06:22.9,000 --> 0:06:27,000
the world's change and it actually gives

144
0:06:25.54,000 --> 0:06:28,000
us powerful and flat

145
0:06:29.43,000 --> 0:06:31,000
you

146
0:06:41.249,000 --> 0:06:43,000
you

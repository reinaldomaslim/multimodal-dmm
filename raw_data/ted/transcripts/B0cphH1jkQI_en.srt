1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
We are drowning in news.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Reuters alone puts out

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
three and a half million news stories a year.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
That's just one source.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
My question is: How many of those stories

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
are actually going to matter in the long run?

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
That's the idea behind The Long News.

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It's a project by The Long Now Foundation,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
which was founded by TEDsters including

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now.

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And when you look at the news through that filter,

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
a lot falls by the wayside.

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
To take the top stories from the A.P. this last year,

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is this going to matter in a decade?

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
Or this?

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Or this?

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Really?

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years?

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Okay, that was kind of cool.

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But the top story of this past year was the economy,

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and I'm just betting that, sooner or later,

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
this particular recession is going to be old news.

26
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So, what kind of stories might

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
make a difference for the future?

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Well, let's take science.

29
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Someday, little robots will go

30
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
through our bloodstreams fixing things.

31
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
That someday is already here if you're a mouse.

32
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Some recent stories:

33
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom;

34
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
they're sending genes into the brain;

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
a robot they built that can crawl through the human body.

36
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
What about resources? How are we going to feed nine billion people?

37
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
We're having trouble feeding six billion today.

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
As we heard yesterday, there's over a billion people hungry.

39
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Britain will starve without genetically modified crops.

40
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Bill Gates, fortunately, has bet a billion on [agricultural] research.

41
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
What about global politics?

42
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The world's going to be very different when and if China sets the agenda,

43
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and they may.

44
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
They've overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest car market,

45
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
they've overtaken Germany as the largest exporter,

46
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and they've started doing DNA tests on kids

47
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
to choose their careers.

48
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know.

49
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Some recent discoveries:

50
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
There's an ant colony from Argentina that has now

51
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
spread to every continent but Antarctica;

52
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
there's a self-directed robot scientist that's made a discovery --

53
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
soon, science may no longer need us,

54
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and life may no longer need us either;

55
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
a microbe wakes up after 120,000 years.

56
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It seems that with or without us,

57
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
life will go on.

58
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
But my pick for the top Long News story of this past year

59
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
was this one: water found on the moon.

60
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there.

61
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
And if NASA doesn't do it, China might,

62
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
or somebody in this room might write a big check.

63
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
My point is this:

64
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
In the long run, some news stories

65
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
are more important than others.

66
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
(Applause)

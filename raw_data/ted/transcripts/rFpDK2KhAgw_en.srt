1
0:00:12.959,000 --> 0:00:13,000
There are things we say

2
0:00:14.261,000 --> 0:00:16,000
when we catch the eye of a stranger

3
0:00:16.681,000 --> 0:00:17,000
or a neighbor walking by.

4
0:00:19.53,000 --> 0:00:21,000
We say, "Hello, how are you?

5
0:00:22.08,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's a beautiful day.

6
0:00:23.812,000 --> 0:00:24,000
How do you feel?"

7
0:00:25.552,000 --> 0:00:28,000
These sound kind of meaningless, right? And, in some ways, they are.

8
0:00:29.21,000 --> 0:00:31,000
They have no semantic meaning.

9
0:00:32.5,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It doesn't matter how you are or what the day is like.

10
0:00:35.934,000 --> 0:00:36,000
They have something else.

11
0:00:37.425,000 --> 0:00:38,000
They have social meaning.

12
0:00:40.051,000 --> 0:00:42,000
What we mean when we say those things is:

13
0:00:42.554,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I see you there.

14
0:00:45.764,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I'm obsessed with talking to strangers.

15
0:00:49.122,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I make eye contact, say hello,

16
0:00:51.499,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I offer help, I listen.

17
0:00:54.699,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I get all kinds of stories.

18
0:00:57.773,000 --> 0:01:,000
About seven years ago, I started documenting my experiences

19
0:01:01.064,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to try to figure out why.

20
0:01:03.9,000 --> 0:01:07,000
What I found was that something really beautiful was going on.

21
0:01:07.963,000 --> 0:01:08,000
This is almost poetic.

22
0:01:10.184,000 --> 0:01:13,000
These were really profound experiences.

23
0:01:13.478,000 --> 0:01:14,000
They were unexpected pleasures.

24
0:01:15.382,000 --> 0:01:17,000
They were genuine emotional connections.

25
0:01:18.37,000 --> 0:01:19,000
They were liberating moments.

26
0:01:22.098,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So one day, I was standing on a corner waiting for the light to change,

27
0:01:26.226,000 --> 0:01:27,000
which, I'm a New Yorker,

28
0:01:27.559,000 --> 0:01:3,000
so that means I was actually standing in the street on the storm drain,

29
0:01:31.667,000 --> 0:01:33,000
as if that could get me across faster.

30
0:01:34.038,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And there's an old man standing next to me.

31
0:01:36.063,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So he's wearing, like, a long overcoat and sort of an old-man hat,

32
0:01:40.914,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and he looked like somebody from a movie.

33
0:01:43.064,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And he says to me,

34
0:01:44.286,000 --> 0:01:46,000
"Don't stand there. You might disappear."

35
0:01:48.095,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So this is absurd, right?

36
0:01:49.386,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But I did what he said. I stepped back onto the sidewalk.

37
0:01:52.697,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And he smiled, and he said,

38
0:01:54.613,000 --> 0:01:55,000
"Good. You never know.

39
0:01:56.518,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I might have turned around,

40
0:01:57.969,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and zoop, you're gone."

41
0:02:01.553,000 --> 0:02:02,000
This was weird,

42
0:02:03.638,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and also really wonderful.

43
0:02:06.091,000 --> 0:02:09,000
He was so warm, and he was so happy that he'd saved me.

44
0:02:09.977,000 --> 0:02:1,000
We had this little bond.

45
0:02:11.987,000 --> 0:02:15,000
For a minute, I felt like my existence as a person

46
0:02:16.174,000 --> 0:02:17,000
had been noticed,

47
0:02:18.335,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and I was worth saving.

48
0:02:23.058,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The really sad thing is,

49
0:02:24.709,000 --> 0:02:25,000
in many parts of the world,

50
0:02:26.406,000 --> 0:02:29,000
we're raised to believe that strangers are dangerous by default,

51
0:02:30.36,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that we can't trust them, that they might hurt us.

52
0:02:34.389,000 --> 0:02:36,000
But most strangers aren't dangerous.

53
0:02:36.991,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We're uneasy around them because we have no context.

54
0:02:40.807,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We don't know what their intentions are.

55
0:02:43.028,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So instead of using our perceptions and making choices,

56
0:02:46.835,000 --> 0:02:48,000
we rely on this category of "stranger."

57
0:02:51.012,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I have a four-year-old.

58
0:02:52.862,000 --> 0:02:53,000
When I say hello to people on the street,

59
0:02:54.861,000 --> 0:02:55,000
she asks me why.

60
0:02:56.82,000 --> 0:02:58,000
She says, "Do we know them?"

61
0:03:00.324,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I say, "No, they're our neighbor."

62
0:03:02.895,000 --> 0:03:03,000
"Are they our friend?"

63
0:03:04.941,000 --> 0:03:06,000
"No, it's just good to be friendly."

64
0:03:07.773,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I think twice every time I say that to her,

65
0:03:11.126,000 --> 0:03:14,000
because I mean it, but as a woman, particularly,

66
0:03:14.658,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I know that not every stranger on the street has the best intentions.

67
0:03:18.873,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It is good to be friendly, and it's good to learn when not to be,

68
0:03:22.751,000 --> 0:03:24,000
but none of that means we have to be afraid.

69
0:03:26.451,000 --> 0:03:28,000
There are two huge benefits

70
0:03:29.348,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to using our senses instead of our fears.

71
0:03:33.015,000 --> 0:03:36,000
The first one is that it liberates us.

72
0:03:37.97,000 --> 0:03:38,000
When you think about it,

73
0:03:39.867,000 --> 0:03:41,000
using perception instead of categories

74
0:03:42.103,000 --> 0:03:43,000
is much easier said than done.

75
0:03:44.859,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Categories are something our brains use.

76
0:03:47.693,000 --> 0:03:48,000
When it comes to people,

77
0:03:49.354,000 --> 0:03:51,000
it's sort of a shortcut for learning about them.

78
0:03:52.9,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We see male, female, young, old,

79
0:03:56.562,000 --> 0:04:,000
black, brown, white, stranger, friend,

80
0:04:00.948,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and we use the information in that box.

81
0:04:04.112,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It's quick, it's easy

82
0:04:05.854,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and it's a road to bias.

83
0:04:08.052,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And it means we're not thinking about people as individuals.

84
0:04:13.774,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I know an American researcher who travels frequently

85
0:04:17.135,000 --> 0:04:19,000
in Central Asia and Africa, alone.

86
0:04:20.91,000 --> 0:04:22,000
She's entering into towns and cities

87
0:04:23.473,000 --> 0:04:25,000
as a complete stranger.

88
0:04:25.937,000 --> 0:04:27,000
She has no bonds, no connections.

89
0:04:28.126,000 --> 0:04:29,000
She's a foreigner.

90
0:04:29.957,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Her survival strategy is this:

91
0:04:32.357,000 --> 0:04:35,000
get one stranger to see you as a real, individual person.

92
0:04:36.839,000 --> 0:04:39,000
If you can do that, it'll help other people see you that way, too.

93
0:04:40.817,000 --> 0:04:44,000
The second benefit of using our senses has to do with intimacy.

94
0:04:46.003,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I know it sounds a little counterintuitive,

95
0:04:48.422,000 --> 0:04:5,000
intimacy and strangers,

96
0:04:50.543,000 --> 0:04:54,000
but these quick interactions can lead to a feeling

97
0:04:54.619,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that sociologists call "fleeting intimacy."

98
0:04:57.785,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So, it's a brief experience that has emotional resonance and meaning.

99
0:05:03.452,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It's the good feeling I got

100
0:05:05.484,000 --> 0:05:09,000
from being saved from the death trap of the storm drain by the old man,

101
0:05:10.61,000 --> 0:05:12,000
or how I feel like part of a community

102
0:05:13.134,000 --> 0:05:16,000
when I talk to somebody on my train on the way to work.

103
0:05:17.665,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Sometimes it goes further.

104
0:05:19.713,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Researchers have found that people often feel more comfortable

105
0:05:24.85,000 --> 0:05:27,000
being honest and open about their inner selves with strangers

106
0:05:28.118,000 --> 0:05:3,000
than they do with their friends and their families --

107
0:05:32.11,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that they often feel more understood by strangers.

108
0:05:37.022,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This gets reported in the media with great lament.

109
0:05:41.125,000 --> 0:05:43,000
"Strangers communicate better than spouses!"

110
0:05:44.901,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It's a good headline, right?

111
0:05:47.547,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I think it entirely misses the point.

112
0:05:51.24,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The important thing about these studies

113
0:05:53.177,000 --> 0:05:55,000
is just how significant these interactions can be;

114
0:05:56.795,000 --> 0:05:59,000
how this special form of closeness

115
0:05:59.923,000 --> 0:06:01,000
gives us something we need as much as we need our friends

116
0:06:02.725,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and our families.

117
0:06:04.933,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So how is it possible that we communicate so well with strangers?

118
0:06:10.585,000 --> 0:06:11,000
There are two reasons.

119
0:06:12.245,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The first one is that it's a quick interaction.

120
0:06:15.183,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It has no consequences.

121
0:06:17.034,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It's easy to be honest with someone you're never going to see again, right?

122
0:06:20.643,000 --> 0:06:21,000
That makes sense.

123
0:06:22.177,000 --> 0:06:24,000
The second reason is where it gets more interesting.

124
0:06:25.085,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We have a bias when it comes to people we're close to.

125
0:06:29.359,000 --> 0:06:32,000
We expect them to understand us.

126
0:06:32.55,000 --> 0:06:33,000
We assume they do,

127
0:06:33.803,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and we expect them to read our minds.

128
0:06:36.717,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So imagine you're at a party,

129
0:06:39.045,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and you can't believe that your friend or your spouse

130
0:06:42.671,000 --> 0:06:44,000
isn't picking up on it that you want to leave early.

131
0:06:45.498,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And you're thinking,

132
0:06:46.896,000 --> 0:06:47,000
"I gave you the look."

133
0:06:50.696,000 --> 0:06:52,000
With a stranger, we have to start from scratch.

134
0:06:53.235,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We tell the whole story,

135
0:06:55.376,000 --> 0:06:58,000
we explain who the people are, how we feel about them;

136
0:06:58.488,000 --> 0:07:,000
we spell out all the inside jokes.

137
0:07:00.68,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And guess what?

138
0:07:02.18,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Sometimes they do understand us a little better.

139
0:07:06.087,000 --> 0:07:07,000
OK.

140
0:07:07.271,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So now that we know that talking to strangers matters,

141
0:07:10.791,000 --> 0:07:11,000
how does it work?

142
0:07:12.721,000 --> 0:07:14,000
There are unwritten rules we tend to follow.

143
0:07:15.495,000 --> 0:07:18,000
The rules are very different depending on what country you're in,

144
0:07:19.315,000 --> 0:07:2,000
what culture you're in.

145
0:07:21.032,000 --> 0:07:23,000
In most parts of the US,

146
0:07:23.185,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the baseline expectation in public

147
0:07:25.464,000 --> 0:07:29,000
is that we maintain a balance between civility and privacy.

148
0:07:30.18,000 --> 0:07:32,000
This is known as civil inattention.

149
0:07:33.263,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So, imagine two people are walking towards each other on the street.

150
0:07:37.047,000 --> 0:07:39,000
They'll glance at each other from a distance.

151
0:07:39.369,000 --> 0:07:4,000
That's the civility, the acknowledgment.

152
0:07:41.375,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And then as they get closer, they'll look away,

153
0:07:43.606,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to give each other some space.

154
0:07:47.151,000 --> 0:07:48,000
In other cultures,

155
0:07:48.437,000 --> 0:07:52,000
people go to extraordinary lengths not to interact at all.

156
0:07:54.533,000 --> 0:07:56,000
People from Denmark tell me

157
0:07:56.791,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that many Danes are so averse to talking to strangers,

158
0:08:00.423,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that they would rather miss their stop on the bus

159
0:08:03.665,000 --> 0:08:06,000
than say "excuse me" to someone that they need to get around.

160
0:08:07.04,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Instead, there's this elaborate shuffling of bags

161
0:08:10.353,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and using your body to say that you need to get past,

162
0:08:13.86,000 --> 0:08:14,000
instead of using two words.

163
0:08:18.178,000 --> 0:08:19,000
In Egypt, I'm told,

164
0:08:20.731,000 --> 0:08:22,000
it's rude to ignore a stranger,

165
0:08:23.047,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and there's a remarkable culture of hospitality.

166
0:08:27.312,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Strangers might ask each other for a sip of water.

167
0:08:30.392,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Or, if you ask someone for directions,

168
0:08:33.12,000 --> 0:08:36,000
they're very likely to invite you home for coffee.

169
0:08:37.441,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We see these unwritten rules most clearly when they're broken,

170
0:08:41.563,000 --> 0:08:43,000
or when you're in a new place

171
0:08:43.67,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and you're trying to figure out what the right thing to do is.

172
0:08:47.332,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Sometimes breaking the rules a little bit is where the action is.

173
0:08:54.551,000 --> 0:08:58,000
In case it's not clear, I really want you to do this. OK?

174
0:08:59.79,000 --> 0:09:,000
So here's how it's going to go.

175
0:09:01.703,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Find somebody who is making eye contact.

176
0:09:03.753,000 --> 0:09:04,000
That's a good signal.

177
0:09:05.466,000 --> 0:09:07,000
The first thing is a simple smile.

178
0:09:08.402,000 --> 0:09:11,000
If you're passing somebody on the street or in the hallway here, smile.

179
0:09:12.342,000 --> 0:09:13,000
See what happens.

180
0:09:14.113,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Another is triangulation.

181
0:09:16.552,000 --> 0:09:17,000
There's you, there's a stranger,

182
0:09:18.255,000 --> 0:09:22,000
there's some third thing that you both might see and comment on,

183
0:09:23.134,000 --> 0:09:24,000
like a piece of public art

184
0:09:25.145,000 --> 0:09:27,000
or somebody preaching in the street

185
0:09:27.659,000 --> 0:09:29,000
or somebody wearing funny clothes.

186
0:09:30.689,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Give it a try.

187
0:09:31.864,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Make a comment about that third thing, and see if starts a conversation.

188
0:09:36.621,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Another is what I call noticing.

189
0:09:38.369,000 --> 0:09:39,000
This is usually giving a compliment.

190
0:09:41.003,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I'm a big fan of noticing people's shoes.

191
0:09:44.283,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I'm actually not wearing fabulous shoes right now,

192
0:09:47.063,000 --> 0:09:49,000
but shoes are fabulous in general.

193
0:09:49.817,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And they're pretty neutral as far as giving compliments goes.

194
0:09:53.967,000 --> 0:09:56,000
People always want to tell you things about their awesome shoes.

195
0:09:57.599,000 --> 0:10:,000
You may have already experienced the dogs and babies principle.

196
0:10:01.52,000 --> 0:10:03,000
It can be awkward to talk to someone on the street;

197
0:10:03.962,000 --> 0:10:05,000
you don't know how they're going to respond.

198
0:10:06.057,000 --> 0:10:08,000
But you can always talk to their dog or their baby.

199
0:10:08.623,000 --> 0:10:09,000
The dog or the baby

200
0:10:09.996,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is a social conduit to the person,

201
0:10:13.095,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and you can tell by how they respond

202
0:10:15.156,000 --> 0:10:16,000
whether they're open to talking more.

203
0:10:18.156,000 --> 0:10:2,000
The last one I want to challenge you to

204
0:10:20.345,000 --> 0:10:21,000
is disclosure.

205
0:10:22.548,000 --> 0:10:24,000
This is a very vulnerable thing to do,

206
0:10:24.914,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and it can be very rewarding.

207
0:10:27.068,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So next time you're talking to a stranger

208
0:10:29.726,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and you feel comfortable,

209
0:10:31.966,000 --> 0:10:33,000
tell them something true about yourself,

210
0:10:34.34,000 --> 0:10:35,000
something really personal.

211
0:10:36.103,000 --> 0:10:39,000
You might have that experience I talked about of feeling understood.

212
0:10:41.854,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Sometimes in conversation, it comes up,

213
0:10:43.824,000 --> 0:10:46,000
people ask me, "What does your dad do?" or, "Where does he live?"

214
0:10:47.205,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And sometimes I tell them the whole truth,

215
0:10:49.451,000 --> 0:10:51,000
which is that he died when I was a kid.

216
0:10:53.386,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Always in those moments,

217
0:10:55.427,000 --> 0:10:57,000
they share their own experiences of loss.

218
0:10:58.407,000 --> 0:11:01,000
We tend to meet disclosure with disclosure,

219
0:11:01.567,000 --> 0:11:02,000
even with strangers.

220
0:11:04.453,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So, here it is.

221
0:11:07.425,000 --> 0:11:1,000
When you talk to strangers, you're making beautiful interruptions

222
0:11:11.303,000 --> 0:11:14,000
into the expected narrative of your daily life

223
0:11:14.813,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and theirs.

224
0:11:16.79,000 --> 0:11:18,000
You're making unexpected connections.

225
0:11:19.42,000 --> 0:11:22,000
If you don't talk to strangers, you're missing out on all of that.

226
0:11:25.544,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We spend a lot of time

227
0:11:27.846,000 --> 0:11:29,000
teaching our children about strangers.

228
0:11:30.764,000 --> 0:11:33,000
What would happen if we spent more time teaching ourselves?

229
0:11:35.441,000 --> 0:11:39,000
We could reject all the ideas that make us so suspicious of each other.

230
0:11:40.649,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We could make a space for change.

231
0:11:44.141,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Thank you.

232
0:11:45.316,000 --> 0:11:5,000
(Applause)

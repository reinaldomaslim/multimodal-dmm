1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Natalie MacMaster: I'm going to just

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
quickly start out with

3
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
a little bit of music here. (Applause)

4
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(Music)

5
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
(Applause)

6
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Thank you! (Applause)

7
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I took my shoes off to dance,

8
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but maybe I'll get at that later.

9
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Anyways, I... where to start?

10
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Well, I'm really excited

11
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to talk a bit about

12
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
my own upbringing in music

13
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and family and all of that,

14
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
but I'm even more excited for you people

15
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to hear about Donnell's amazing family

16
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and maybe even a little bit about

17
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
how we met,

18
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and all that sort of thing,

19
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
but for those of you that may not

20
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
be familiar with my upbringing,

21
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I'm from Cape Breton Island,

22
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Nova Scotia, eastern Canada,

23
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
which is a very, very musical island,

24
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and its origins come from Scotland

25
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
with the music and all the traditions,

26
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
the dancing, the language,

27
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
which unfortunately is dying out

28
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
in Cape Breton.

29
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The traditional language is Gaelic,

30
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
but a lot of the music came

31
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
from the Gaelic language,

32
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and the dancing and the singing

33
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and everything, and my bloodline

34
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
is Scottish through and through,

35
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
but my mother and father

36
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
are two very, very musical people.

37
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
My mom taught me to dance

38
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
when I was five, and my dad

39
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
taught me to play fiddle when I was nine.

40
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
My uncle is a very well-known

41
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Cape Breton fiddler.

42
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
His name's Buddy MacMaster,

43
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and just a wonderful guy,

44
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and we have a great tradition at home

45
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
called square dancing,

46
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and we had parties, great parties

47
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
at our house and the neighbors' houses,

48
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and you talk about kitchen cèilidhs.

49
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Well, cèilidh first of all is Gaelic for party,

50
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
but kitchen party

51
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
in Cape Breton is very common,

52
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and basically somebody drops into the house,

53
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and no matter what house you go to

54
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
in Cape Breton, there's a fiddle there,

55
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
guaranteed, and I'd say,

56
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
well there's first of all more fiddlers

57
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
per capita in Cape Breton than anywhere

58
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
in the world, so ten chances to one,

59
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
the fellow who walked in the door

60
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
could play it, so you'd have someone come

61
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
into the house, you'd invite them to play

62
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
a tune, and lo and behold

63
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
a little party would start up and somebody would dance,

64
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and somebody would sing, and all that sort of thing,

65
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
so it was a wonderful, wonderful way

66
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to grow up, and that is where

67
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
my beginnings in music come from:

68
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
my surroundings, my family,

69
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
just my bloodline in itself, and, oh,

70
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I've done lots of things with my music.

71
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I've recorded lots of CDs.

72
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I was nominated for a Grammy and

73
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I've won some awards and stuff like that,

74
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
so that's awesome,

75
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
but the best part was meeting my husband,

76
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and I've actually known Donnell

77
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
for probably 12 years now, and

78
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I'm going to get into a little bit of, I guess,

79
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
how music brought us together,

80
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
but I'm going to introduce you

81
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
right now to my new husband

82
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
as of October 5,

83
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Donnell Leahy. (Applause)

84
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Applause)

85
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Donnell Leahy: Thank you. I'm kind of new to the TED

86
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
experience and I'm glad to be here,

87
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
but I'm just trying to put it all together,

88
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
trying to figure all you people out, and I've

89
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
been here for a short while, and I'm starting

90
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to understand a little bit better.

91
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So I asked Natalie, what do I do?

92
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And she said, just talk about yourself.

93
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It's kind of boring, but I'll just tell you a little

94
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
bit about my family. I'm one of 11 brothers

95
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and sisters from Lakefield, Ontario,

96
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
an hour and a half northeast of Toronto,

97
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and we grew up on a farm.

98
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Mom and Dad raised beef cattle,

99
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and I'm the oldest boy.

100
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
There are four girls a little bit older than me.

101
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
We grew up without a television.

102
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
People find that strange,

103
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
but I think it was a great blessing for us.

104
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We had a television for a few years,

105
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
but of course we wasted so much time

106
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and the work wasn't getting done,

107
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
so out went the television.

108
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
We grew up playing—

109
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
Mom's from Cape Breton, coincidentally.

110
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Mom and Natalie's mother

111
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
knew each other. We grew up playing,

112
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and used to dance together, right, yeah.

113
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
(Laughter) We grew up playing a bunch of,

114
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
we played by ear and I think

115
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that's important for us because

116
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
we were not really exposed to a lot of

117
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
different styles of music.

118
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We learned to play the instruments,

119
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
but we kind of had to come from within

120
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
or go from within, because we didn't

121
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
watch television, we didn't listen to a lot of

122
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
radio. We went to church

123
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and to school sometimes,

124
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and farmed and played music,

125
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
so we were able, I think,

126
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
at a very critical age to develop

127
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
our own style, our own self,

128
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and my mother plays, my father plays,

129
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and the style that came

130
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
from the Ottawa Valley in Ontario,

131
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
we call it French-Canadian style

132
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
but it originated in logging camps.

133
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Years ago, hundreds of men would go

134
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
up for the winter to the camps

135
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
in Northern Ontario and in Quebec,

136
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and they were all different cultures,

137
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and the Irish, the French, Scottish,

138
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
German, they'd all meet, and of course

139
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
at night, they'd play cards

140
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and step dance and play fiddles,

141
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and over the course of many years,

142
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
the Ottawa Valley fiddling kind of evolved

143
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and the Ottawa Valley step dancing

144
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
evolved, so that's, I kind of started out

145
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
with that style and I quickly

146
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
started doing my own thing,

147
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and then I met Natalie, and I was

148
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
exposed to the great Cape Breton fiddling.

149
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
That's how we met. (Laughter)

150
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
You tell them. (Laughter)

151
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
NM: You want to or no? (Laughter)

152
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Well I guess I have to now.

153
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Well, it's just so interesting that

154
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Donnell's upbringing was very similar

155
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to mine, and I actually saw Donnell play

156
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
when I was about 12 years old,

157
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and he and his family came to

158
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Inverness, which is about 45 minutes

159
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
from where I lived, and I was just

160
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
blown away, like, it was just amazing,

161
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and you'll find out why pretty soon here,

162
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
but I couldn't believe the fiddling

163
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and Mom was there with me,

164
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and she was saying —

165
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Donnell's mother came up on stage

166
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and danced with her children, and Mom

167
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
was saying, "That's Julie MacDonnell,

168
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I used to dance with her when we

169
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
were kids. Little did I think our children

170
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
would be playing instruments, you know,

171
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
playing music, yeah."

172
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Twelve years, er, 20 years later little did she think

173
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
her kids would be getting married,

174
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
but anyway, so, then I got

175
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
a phone call about, I dunno,

176
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
seven years later. I was 19,

177
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
first or second year of college,

178
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and it was Donnell, and

179
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
he said "Hi, you probably don't know me

180
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
but my name is Donnell Leahy."

181
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And I said, "I know you.

182
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I have a tape of yours at home."

183
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And he said, "Well, I'm in Truro,"

184
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
which is where I was,

185
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and he asked me out for supper.

186
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
That's it. (Laughter)

187
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
(Applause)

188
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Then — Will I keep going? (Laughs)

189
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
(Laughter)

190
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Then we dated for two years,

191
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
broke up for 10, got back together

192
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and got married. (Laughter) (Applause)

193
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
DL: So anyway, we're running out of time,

194
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
so I'll just get to it.

195
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I'm going to play a piece of music for you.

196
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
It's actually a Scottish piece I've chosen.

197
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I starts out with a slow air.

198
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Airs were played in Europe

199
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
at burials, as a body was carried out

200
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
from the wake site to the burial site,

201
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
the procession was led by a piper

202
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
or a fiddle player.

203
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I'll quickly play a short part of the air,

204
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and then I'm going to get into

205
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult

206
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
to play when you're not warmed up,

207
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
so, if I mess it up, pretend you like it

208
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
anyway. It's called The Banks.

209
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
(Tuning)

210
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
(Laughter)

211
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
(Music)

212
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
(Applause)

213
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
NM: Well, we're gonna play one

214
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
together now. (Applause)

215
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
We're laughing, like, because

216
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
our styles are totally different,

217
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
as you can hear.

218
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
And so, you know, Donnell and I

219
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
are actually in the process of

220
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
writing new pieces of music together

221
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
that we can play,

222
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
but we don't have any of those ready.

223
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
We just started yesterday. (Laughter)

224
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
So we're gonna play something together anyway.

225
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
DL: With one minute.

226
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:28,000
NM: With one minute.

227
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
(Audience reaction)

228
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
DL: You start. NM: No, you have to start,

229
0:17:32.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
because you've got to do your thing.

230
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
(Music)

231
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
NM: I'm not tuned. Hold on.

232
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:56,000
(Tuning)

233
0:17:56.16,000 --> 0:17:58,000
NM: I feel like I'm in the duck or

234
0:17:58.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
the bird pose right now. (Laughter)

235
0:18:09.16,000 --> 0:18:21,000
(Music)

236
0:18:40.16,000 --> 0:18:48,000
(Audience claps along)

237
0:19:42.16,000 --> 0:19:5,000
(Applause)

238
0:19:50.16,000 --> 0:19:53,000
Announcer: Great news,

239
0:19:53.16,000 --> 0:19:55,000
they're running late downstairs.

240
0:19:55.16,000 --> 0:19:57,000
We've got another 10 minutes.

241
0:19:57.16,000 --> 0:20:04,000
(Applause)

242
0:20:04.16,000 --> 0:20:07,000
NM: Okay. Sure.

243
0:20:11.16,000 --> 0:20:13,000
All right, okay.

244
0:20:13.16,000 --> 0:20:15,000
Let's get her going. (Applause)

245
0:20:16.16,000 --> 0:20:23,000
(Tuning)

246
0:20:23.16,000 --> 0:20:26,000
DL: What do you want to play?

247
0:20:26.16,000 --> 0:20:28,000
NM: Well, um...

248
0:20:28.16,000 --> 0:20:36,000
(Music) (Laughter)

249
0:20:39.16,000 --> 0:20:41,000
NM: Uh, sure.

250
0:20:41.16,000 --> 0:20:43,000
DL: How fast?

251
0:20:44.16,000 --> 0:20:46,000
NM: Not too fast.

252
0:20:46.16,000 --> 0:20:58,000
(Music)

253
0:20:58.16,000 --> 0:21:04,000
(Audience claps along)

254
0:21:04.16,000 --> 0:21:06,000
(Cheering)

255
0:21:06.16,000 --> 0:21:14,000
(Audience claps along)

256
0:21:14.16,000 --> 0:21:18,000
(Music)

257
0:21:38.16,000 --> 0:21:47,000
(Applause)

258
0:21:49.16,000 --> 0:21:51,000
DL: We're going to play a tune

259
0:21:51.16,000 --> 0:21:53,000
and Natalie's going to accompany me on the piano.

260
0:21:53.16,000 --> 0:21:55,000
The Cape Breton piano playing

261
0:21:55.16,000 --> 0:21:58,000
is just awesome. It's very rhythmic

262
0:21:58.16,000 --> 0:22:,000
and, you'll see it.

263
0:22:00.16,000 --> 0:22:03,000
My mom plays piano, and she learned

264
0:22:03.16,000 --> 0:22:05,000
to play before they had a piano at home

265
0:22:05.16,000 --> 0:22:07,000
in Cape Breton. Before Mom's family had

266
0:22:07.16,000 --> 0:22:09,000
a piano in Cape Breton, she learned to play

267
0:22:09.16,000 --> 0:22:12,000
the rhythms on a piece of board,

268
0:22:12.16,000 --> 0:22:14,000
and the fiddlers would all congregate

269
0:22:14.16,000 --> 0:22:16,000
to play on the cold winter's evenings

270
0:22:16.16,000 --> 0:22:19,000
and Mom would be banging on this board,

271
0:22:19.16,000 --> 0:22:21,000
so when they bought a piano,

272
0:22:21.16,000 --> 0:22:23,000
they bought it in Toronto and had it taken

273
0:22:23.16,000 --> 0:22:26,000
by train and brought in on a horse,

274
0:22:26.16,000 --> 0:22:29,000
a horse and sleigh to the house.

275
0:22:29.16,000 --> 0:22:31,000
It became the only piano in the region,

276
0:22:31.16,000 --> 0:22:33,000
and Mom said she could basically play

277
0:22:33.16,000 --> 0:22:36,000
as soon as the piano arrived,

278
0:22:36.16,000 --> 0:22:38,000
she could play it because she had learned

279
0:22:38.16,000 --> 0:22:4,000
all these rhythms. Anyway, we found

280
0:22:40.16,000 --> 0:22:42,000
the piano last year and were able to

281
0:22:42.16,000 --> 0:22:44,000
bring it back home. We purchased it.

282
0:22:44.16,000 --> 0:22:46,000
It had gone through, like,

283
0:22:46.16,000 --> 0:22:48,000
five or six families,

284
0:22:48.16,000 --> 0:22:5,000
and it was just a big thing for us,

285
0:22:50.16,000 --> 0:22:53,000
and we found actually an old picture

286
0:22:53.16,000 --> 0:22:56,000
of somebody and their family years ago.

287
0:22:56.16,000 --> 0:22:58,000
Anyway, I'm blabbering on here.

288
0:22:58.16,000 --> 0:23:,000
NM: No, I want you to tell them about Leahy.

289
0:23:00.16,000 --> 0:23:03,000
DL: What about Leahy? (Laughter)

290
0:23:03.16,000 --> 0:23:06,000
NM: Just tell them what—

291
0:23:06.16,000 --> 0:23:08,000
DL: She wants me to talk about—

292
0:23:08.16,000 --> 0:23:1,000
We have a band named Leahy.

293
0:23:10.16,000 --> 0:23:12,000
There's 11 siblings. We, um—

294
0:23:12.16,000 --> 0:23:14,000
What will I tell them? (Laughter)

295
0:23:14.16,000 --> 0:23:17,000
We opened—

296
0:23:17.16,000 --> 0:23:19,000
NM: No surgeries.

297
0:23:19.16,000 --> 0:23:21,000
DL: No surgeries, oh yeah.

298
0:23:21.16,000 --> 0:23:23,000
We had a great opportunity.

299
0:23:23.16,000 --> 0:23:25,000
We opened for Shania Twain for two years on her international tour.

300
0:23:25.16,000 --> 0:23:27,000
It was a big thing for us, and now

301
0:23:27.16,000 --> 0:23:29,000
all my sisters are off having babies

302
0:23:29.16,000 --> 0:23:31,000
and the boys are all getting married, so we're

303
0:23:31.16,000 --> 0:23:33,000
staying close to home for, I guess,

304
0:23:33.16,000 --> 0:23:35,000
another couple of weeks.

305
0:23:35.16,000 --> 0:23:37,000
What can I say? I don't know what to say,

306
0:23:37.16,000 --> 0:23:41,000
Natalie. We, uh... (Laughter)

307
0:23:44.16,000 --> 0:23:47,000
(Laughter)

308
0:23:48.16,000 --> 0:23:5,000
NM: Is this what marriage is about?

309
0:23:50.16,000 --> 0:23:53,000
(Applause)

310
0:23:53.16,000 --> 0:23:56,000
I like it. (Applause)

311
0:23:59.16,000 --> 0:24:01,000
(Laughter)

312
0:24:01.16,000 --> 0:24:03,000
DL: Oh yeah, okay,

313
0:24:03.16,000 --> 0:24:06,000
in my family we had seven girls, four boys,

314
0:24:06.16,000 --> 0:24:08,000
we had two fiddles and one piano,

315
0:24:08.16,000 --> 0:24:1,000
and of course we were all fighting to play

316
0:24:10.16,000 --> 0:24:13,000
on the instruments, so dad and mom

317
0:24:13.16,000 --> 0:24:15,000
set a rule that you couldn't kick anyone

318
0:24:15.16,000 --> 0:24:17,000
off the instrument. You had to wait

319
0:24:17.16,000 --> 0:24:19,000
until they were finished, so of course,

320
0:24:19.16,000 --> 0:24:21,000
what we would do is we'd get on the piano

321
0:24:21.16,000 --> 0:24:23,000
and you wouldn't even get off to eat,

322
0:24:23.16,000 --> 0:24:25,000
because you wouldn't want to give it up

323
0:24:25.16,000 --> 0:24:27,000
to your brother or sister, and they'd wait

324
0:24:27.16,000 --> 0:24:29,000
and wait and wait, and it'd be midnight

325
0:24:29.16,000 --> 0:24:31,000
and you'd be still sitting there on the piano,

326
0:24:31.16,000 --> 0:24:34,000
but it was their way to get us to practice.

327
0:24:34.16,000 --> 0:24:36,000
Will we play a tune?

328
0:24:36.16,000 --> 0:24:39,000
NM: It worked. DL: It worked.

329
0:24:39.16,000 --> 0:24:41,000
Sorry, I hate to carry on...

330
0:24:41.16,000 --> 0:24:43,000
So this is our last number, and we'll feature Nat on piano.

331
0:24:43.16,000 --> 0:24:46,000
Okay, play in, how about A?

332
0:24:53.16,000 --> 0:25:03,000
(Music)

333
0:27:02.16,000 --> 0:27:15,000
(Applause)

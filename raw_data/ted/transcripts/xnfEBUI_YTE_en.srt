2
0:00:13.016,000 --> 0:00:15,000
We've all heard about how the dinosaurs died.

3
0:00:16.285,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The story I'm going to tell you

4
0:00:18.262,000 --> 0:00:22,000
happened over 200 million years before the dinosaurs went extinct.

5
0:00:23.481,000 --> 0:00:25,000
This story starts at the very beginning,

6
0:00:26.391,000 --> 0:00:28,000
when dinosaurs were just getting their start.

7
0:00:29.269,000 --> 0:00:31,000
One of the biggest mysteries in evolutionary biology

8
0:00:32.018,000 --> 0:00:35,000
is why dinosaurs were so successful.

9
0:00:35.548,000 --> 0:00:38,000
What led to their global dominance for so many years?

10
0:00:39.896,000 --> 0:00:42,000
When people think about why dinosaurs were so amazing,

11
0:00:43.438,000 --> 0:00:46,000
they usually think about the biggest or the smallest dinosaur,

12
0:00:47.267,000 --> 0:00:48,000
or who was the fastest,

13
0:00:48.736,000 --> 0:00:49,000
or who had the most feathers,

14
0:00:50.328,000 --> 0:00:52,000
the most ridiculous armor, spikes or teeth.

15
0:00:54.126,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But perhaps the answer had to do with their internal anatomy --

16
0:00:58.134,000 --> 0:01:,000
a secret weapon, so to speak.

17
0:01:00.716,000 --> 0:01:03,000
My colleagues and I, we think it was their lungs.

18
0:01:05.149,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I am both a paleontologist and a comparative anatomist,

19
0:01:09.427,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and I am interested in understanding

20
0:01:11.396,000 --> 0:01:14,000
how the specialized dinosaur lung helped them take over the planet.

21
0:01:15.797,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So we are going to jump back over 200 million years

22
0:01:19.522,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to the Triassic period.

23
0:01:21.299,000 --> 0:01:23,000
The environment was extremely harsh,

24
0:01:23.715,000 --> 0:01:24,000
there were no flowering plants,

25
0:01:25.379,000 --> 0:01:27,000
so this means that there was no grass.

26
0:01:27.658,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So imagine a landscape filled with all pine trees and ferns.

27
0:01:32.587,000 --> 0:01:35,000
At the same time, there were small lizards,

28
0:01:36.064,000 --> 0:01:38,000
mammals, insects,

29
0:01:38.479,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and there were also carnivorous and herbivorous reptiles --

30
0:01:42.817,000 --> 0:01:44,000
all competing for the same resources.

31
0:01:45.454,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Critical to this story

32
0:01:47.019,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is that oxygen levels have been estimated to have been as low as 15 percent,

33
0:01:52.371,000 --> 0:01:54,000
compared to today's 21 percent.

34
0:01:54.932,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So it would have been crucial for dinosaurs to be able to breathe

35
0:01:58.543,000 --> 0:01:59,000
in this low-oxygen environment,

36
0:02:00.442,000 --> 0:02:01,000
not only to survive

37
0:02:02.321,000 --> 0:02:04,000
but to thrive and to diversify.

38
0:02:06.462,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So, how do we know what dinosaur lungs were even like,

39
0:02:09.583,000 --> 0:02:14,000
since all that remains of a dinosaur generally is its fossilized skeleton?

40
0:02:15.257,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The method that we use is called "extant phylogenetic bracketing."

41
0:02:21.085,000 --> 0:02:25,000
This is a fancy way of saying that we study the anatomy --

42
0:02:25.154,000 --> 0:02:28,000
specifically in this case, the lungs and skeleton --

43
0:02:28.754,000 --> 0:02:31,000
of the living descendants of dinosaurs on the evolutionary tree.

44
0:02:33.235,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So we would look at the anatomy of birds,

45
0:02:36.223,000 --> 0:02:38,000
who are the direct descendants of dinosaurs,

46
0:02:39.105,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and we'd look at the anatomy of crocodilians,

47
0:02:41.478,000 --> 0:02:42,000
who are their closest living relatives,

48
0:02:43.45,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and then we would look at the anatomy of lizards and turtles,

49
0:02:46.467,000 --> 0:02:48,000
who we can think of like their cousins.

50
0:02:49.096,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And then we apply these anatomical data to the fossil record,

51
0:02:52.556,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and then we can use that to reconstruct the lungs of dinosaurs.

52
0:02:56.223,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And in this specific instance,

53
0:02:58.291,000 --> 0:03:02,000
the skeleton of dinosaurs most closely resembles that of modern birds.

54
0:03:03.696,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So, because dinosaurs were competing with early mammals during this time period,

55
0:03:08.486,000 --> 0:03:11,000
it's important to understand the basic blueprint of the mammalian lung.

56
0:03:12.597,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Also, to reintroduce you to lungs in general,

57
0:03:15.455,000 --> 0:03:17,000
we will use my dog Mila of Troy,

58
0:03:18.114,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the face that launched a thousand treats,

59
0:03:20.178,000 --> 0:03:21,000
as our model.

60
0:03:21.421,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Laughter)

61
0:03:23.028,000 --> 0:03:26,000
This story takes place inside of a chest cavity.

62
0:03:26.788,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So I want you to visualize the ribcage of a dog.

63
0:03:30.009,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Think about how the spinal vertebral column

64
0:03:32.49,000 --> 0:03:35,000
is completely horizontal to the ground.

65
0:03:35.783,000 --> 0:03:37,000
This is how the spinal vertebral column is going to be

66
0:03:38.382,000 --> 0:03:4,000
in all of the animals that we'll be talking about,

67
0:03:40.812,000 --> 0:03:41,000
whether they walked on two legs

68
0:03:42.334,000 --> 0:03:43,000
or four legs.

69
0:03:43.511,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Now I want you to climb inside of the imaginary ribcage and look up.

70
0:03:48.944,000 --> 0:03:5,000
This is our thoracic ceiling.

71
0:03:51.48,000 --> 0:03:54,000
This is where the top surface of the lungs comes into direct contact

72
0:03:55.423,000 --> 0:03:57,000
with the ribs and vertebrae.

73
0:03:58.374,000 --> 0:04:01,000
This interface is where our story takes place.

74
0:04:02.398,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Now I want you to visualize the lungs of a dog.

75
0:04:05.457,000 --> 0:04:08,000
On the outside, it's like a giant inflatable bag

76
0:04:08.669,000 --> 0:04:11,000
where all parts of the bag expand during inhalation

77
0:04:12.104,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and contract during exhalation.

78
0:04:14.601,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Inside of the bag, there's a series of branching tubes,

79
0:04:17.902,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and these tubes are called the bronchial tree.

80
0:04:20.899,000 --> 0:04:26,000
These tubes deliver the inhaled oxygen to, ultimately, the alveolus.

81
0:04:27.038,000 --> 0:04:32,000
They cross over a thin membrane into the bloodstream by diffusion.

82
0:04:32.572,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Now, this part is critical.

83
0:04:35.44,000 --> 0:04:38,000
The entire mammalian lung is mobile.

84
0:04:38.949,000 --> 0:04:43,000
That means it's moving during the entire respiratory process,

85
0:04:43.991,000 --> 0:04:45,000
so that thin membrane, the blood-gas barrier,

86
0:04:46.601,000 --> 0:04:49,000
cannot be too thin or it will break.

87
0:04:49.66,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Now, remember the blood-gas barrier, because we will be returning to this.

88
0:04:53.721,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So, you're still with me?

89
0:04:55.23,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Because we're going to start birds and it gets crazy,

90
0:04:57.882,000 --> 0:04:58,000
so hold on to your butts.

91
0:04:59.346,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

92
0:05:01.648,000 --> 0:05:04,000
The bird is completely different from the mammal.

93
0:05:05.495,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And we are going to be using birds as our model

94
0:05:07.912,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to reconstruct the lungs of dinosaurs.

95
0:05:10.367,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So in the bird,

96
0:05:11.955,000 --> 0:05:15,000
air passes through the lung, but the lung does not expand or contract.

97
0:05:16.707,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The lung is immobilized,

98
0:05:18.672,000 --> 0:05:2,000
it has the texture of a dense sponge

99
0:05:20.988,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and it's inflexible and locked into place on the top and sides by the ribcage

100
0:05:26.219,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and on the bottom by a horizontal membrane.

101
0:05:30.3,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It is then unidirectionally ventilated

102
0:05:33.41,000 --> 0:05:36,000
by a series of flexible, bag-like structures

103
0:05:37.422,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that branch off of the bronchial tree,

104
0:05:40.234,000 --> 0:05:41,000
beyond the lung itself,

105
0:05:41.846,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and these are called air sacs.

106
0:05:44.249,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Now, this entire extremely delicate setup is locked into place

107
0:05:49.631,000 --> 0:05:52,000
by a series of forked ribs

108
0:05:52.844,000 --> 0:05:54,000
all along the thoracic ceiling.

109
0:05:55.573,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Also, in many species of birds,

110
0:05:58.679,000 --> 0:06:,000
extensions arise from the lung

111
0:06:01.127,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and the air sacs,

112
0:06:02.697,000 --> 0:06:04,000
they invade the skeletal tissues --

113
0:06:05.329,000 --> 0:06:07,000
usually the vertebrae, sometimes the ribs --

114
0:06:08.055,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and they lock the respiratory system into place.

115
0:06:11.038,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And this is called "vertebral pneumaticity."

116
0:06:14.498,000 --> 0:06:17,000
The forked ribs and the vertebral pneumaticity

117
0:06:17.764,000 --> 0:06:2,000
are two clues that we can hunt for in the fossil record,

118
0:06:21.305,000 --> 0:06:23,000
because these two skeletal traits

119
0:06:23.918,000 --> 0:06:27,000
would indicate that regions of the respiratory system of dinosaurs

120
0:06:28.661,000 --> 0:06:29,000
are immobilized.

121
0:06:33.2,000 --> 0:06:35,000
This anchoring of the respiratory system

122
0:06:35.83,000 --> 0:06:38,000
facilitated the evolution of the thinning of the blood-gas barrier,

123
0:06:39.761,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that thin membrane over which oxygen was diffusing into the bloodstream.

124
0:06:46.746,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The immobility permits this because a thin barrier is a weak barrier,

125
0:06:52.661,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and the weak barrier would rupture if it was actively being ventilated

126
0:06:57.493,000 --> 0:06:58,000
like a mammalian lung.

127
0:07:00.056,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So why do we care about this?

128
0:07:01.613,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Why does this even matter?

129
0:07:04.083,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Oxygen more easily diffuses across a thin membrane,

130
0:07:09.536,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and a thin membrane is one way of enhancing respiration

131
0:07:15.651,000 --> 0:07:17,000
under low-oxygen conditions --

132
0:07:18.011,000 --> 0:07:22,000
low-oxygen conditions like that of the Triassic period.

133
0:07:23.425,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So, if dinosaurs did indeed have this type of lung,

134
0:07:28.154,000 --> 0:07:32,000
they'd be better equipped to breathe than all other animals,

135
0:07:32.235,000 --> 0:07:34,000
including mammals.

136
0:07:34.851,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So do you remember the extant phylogenetic bracket method

137
0:07:38.49,000 --> 0:07:4,000
where we take the anatomy of modern animals,

138
0:07:41.393,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and we apply that to the fossil record?

139
0:07:43.952,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So, clue number one was the forked ribs of modern birds.

140
0:07:48.838,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Well, we find that in pretty much the majority of dinosaurs.

141
0:07:53.734,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So that means that the top surface of the lungs of dinosaurs

142
0:07:58.555,000 --> 0:08:,000
would be locked into place,

143
0:08:00.893,000 --> 0:08:02,000
just like modern birds.

144
0:08:03.869,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Clue number two is vertebral pneumaticity.

145
0:08:07.43,000 --> 0:08:11,000
We find this in sauropod dinosaurs and theropod dinosaurs,

146
0:08:12.261,000 --> 0:08:15,000
which is the group that contains predatory dinosaurs

147
0:08:15.56,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and gave rise to modern birds.

148
0:08:18.25,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And while we don't find evidence of fossilized lung tissue in dinosaurs,

149
0:08:23.613,000 --> 0:08:27,000
vertebral pneumaticity gives us evidence of what the lung was doing

150
0:08:28.186,000 --> 0:08:3,000
during the life of these animals.

151
0:08:31.211,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Lung tissue or air sac tissue was invading the vertebrae,

152
0:08:36.58,000 --> 0:08:38,000
hollowing them out just like a modern bird,

153
0:08:39.111,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and locking regions of the respiratory system into place,

154
0:08:43.269,000 --> 0:08:44,000
immobilizing them.

155
0:08:46.138,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The forked ribs

156
0:08:47.947,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and the vertebral pneumaticity together

157
0:08:50.815,000 --> 0:08:54,000
were creating an immobilized, rigid framework

158
0:08:55.746,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that locked the respiratory system into place

159
0:08:58.712,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that permitted the evolution of that superthin, superdelicate blood-gas barrier

160
0:09:04.51,000 --> 0:09:06,000
that we see today in modern birds.

161
0:09:07.39,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Evidence of this straightjacketed lung in dinosaurs

162
0:09:10.904,000 --> 0:09:13,000
means that they had the capability to evolve a lung

163
0:09:14.402,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that would have been able to breathe

164
0:09:16.164,000 --> 0:09:21,000
under the hypoxic, or low-oxygen, atmosphere of the Triassic period.

165
0:09:21.981,000 --> 0:09:26,000
This rigid skeletal setup in dinosaurs would have given them

166
0:09:27.102,000 --> 0:09:32,000
a significant adaptive advantage over other animals, particularly mammals,

167
0:09:32.609,000 --> 0:09:34,000
whose flexible lung couldn't have adapted

168
0:09:35.334,000 --> 0:09:38,000
to the hypoxic, or low-oxygen, atmosphere of the Triassic.

169
0:09:39.664,000 --> 0:09:44,000
This anatomy may have been the secret weapon of dinosaurs

170
0:09:44.758,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that gave them that advantage over other animals.

171
0:09:48.096,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And this gives us an excellent launchpad

172
0:09:50.924,000 --> 0:09:54,000
to start testing the hypotheses of dinosaurian diversification.

173
0:09:55.856,000 --> 0:09:58,000
This is the story of the dinosaurs' beginning,

174
0:09:59.774,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and it's just the beginning of the story of our research into this subject.

175
0:10:04.932,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Thank you.

176
0:10:06.148,000 --> 0:10:08,000

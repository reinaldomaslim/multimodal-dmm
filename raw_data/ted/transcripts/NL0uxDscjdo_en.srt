1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
My journey to coming here today

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
started in 1974.

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
That's me with the funny gloves.

4
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I was 17 and going on a peace walk.

5
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
What I didn't know though, was most of those people, standing there

6
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
with me, were Moonies.

7
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And within a week

9
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I had come to believe

10
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that the second coming of Christ had occurred,

11
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that it was Sun Myung Moon,

12
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and that I had been specially chosen and prepared by God

13
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
to be his disciple.

14
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Now as cool as that sounds,

15
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
my family was not that thrilled with this.

16
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And they tried everything they could to get me out of there.

18
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
There was an underground railroad of sorts

19
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that was going on during those years. Maybe some of you remember it.

20
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
They were called deprogrammers.

21
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And after about five long years

22
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
my family had me deprogrammed.

23
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And I then became a deprogrammer.

24
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I started going out on cases.

25
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And after about five years of doing this,

26
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I was arrested for kidnapping.

27
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Most of the cases I went out on

28
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
were called involuntary.

29
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
What happened was that the family

30
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
had to get their loved ones some safe place somehow.

31
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And so they took them to some safe place.

32
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And we would come in and talk to them, usually for about a week.

33
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And so after this happened,

34
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work.

35
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And about 20 years went by.

36
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
There was a burning question though that would not leave me.

37
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And that was, "How did this happen to me?"

38
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And in fact, what did happen to my brain?

39
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Because something did.

40
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And so I decided to write a book, a memoir,

41
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
about this decade of my life.

42
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And toward the end of writing that book

43
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
there was a documentary that came out.

44
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It was on Jonestown.

45
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And it had a chilling effect on me.

46
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
These are the dead in Jonestown.

47
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
About 900 people died that day,

48
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
most of them taking their own lives.

49
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Women gave poison to their babies,

50
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and watched foam come from their mouths as they died.

51
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The top picture is a group of Moonies

52
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that have been blessed by their messiah.

53
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Their mates were chosen for them.

54
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
The bottom picture is Hitler youth.

55
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
This is the leg of a suicide bomber.

56
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The thing I had to admit to myself,

57
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
with great repulsion,

58
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
was that I get it.

59
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I understand how this could happen.

60
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I understand how someone's brain,

61
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
how someone's mind can come to the place

62
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
where it makes sense --

63
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
in fact it would be wrong, when your brain is working like that --

64
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
not to try to save the world through genocide.

65
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And so what is this? How does this work?

66
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And how I've come to view what happened to me

67
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
is a viral, memetic infection.

68
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
For those of you who aren't familiar with memetics,

69
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
a meme has been defined as

70
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
an idea that replicates in the human brain

71
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and moves from brain to brain like a virus,

72
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
much like a virus. The way a virus works is --

73
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
it can infect and do the most damage to someone

74
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
who has a compromised immune system.

75
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
In 1974, I was young, I was naive,

76
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and I was pretty lost in my world.

77
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I was really idealistic.

78
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
These easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing

79
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
when you are emotionally vulnerable.

80
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
What happens is that

81
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
circular logic takes over.

82
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
"Moon is one with God.

83
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
God is going to fix all the problems in the world.

84
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
All I have to do is humbly follow.

85
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Because God is going to stop war and hunger --

86
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
all these things I wanted to do --

87
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
all I have to do is humbly follow.

88
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Because after all, God is [working through] the messiah. He's going to fix all this."

89
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It becomes impenetrable.

90
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And the most dangerous part of this

91
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
is that is creates "us" and "them,"

92
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
"right" and "wrong,"

93
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
"good" and "evil."

94
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And it makes anything possible,

95
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
makes anything rationalizable.

96
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And the thing is, though,

97
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
if you looked at my brain

98
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
during those years in the Moonies --

99
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
neuroscience is expanding exponentially,

100
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday. Science is expanding.

101
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
We're beginning to look inside the brain.

102
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And so if you looked at my brain, or any brain that's infected with

103
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
a viral memetic infection like this,

104
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and compared it to anyone in this room,

105
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis,

106
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I am convinced it would look very, very different.

107
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And that, strange as it may sound,

108
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
gives me hope.

109
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And the reason that gives me hope

110
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
is that the first thing is to admit

111
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that we have a problem.

112
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But it's a human problem. It's a scientific problem, if you will.

113
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It happens in the human brain. There is no evil force out there to get us.

114
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
And so this is something that, through research and education,

115
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I believe that we can solve.

116
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And so the first step is to realize

117
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that we can do this together,

118
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and that there is no "us" and "them."

119
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

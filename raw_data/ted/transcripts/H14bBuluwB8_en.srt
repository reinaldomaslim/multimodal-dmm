0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When I was 27 years old,

3
0:00:14.954,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I left a very demanding job in management consulting

4
0:00:18.301,000 --> 0:00:21,000
for a job that was even more demanding: teaching.

5
0:00:23.298,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I went to teach seventh graders math

6
0:00:25.802,000 --> 0:00:26,000
in the New York City public schools.

7
0:00:28.202,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And like any teacher, I made quizzes and tests.

8
0:00:31.107,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I gave out homework assignments.

9
0:00:33.107,000 --> 0:00:35,000
When the work came back, I calculated grades.

10
0:00:36.758,000 --> 0:00:4,000
What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference

11
0:00:41.334,000 --> 0:00:44,000
between my best and my worst students.

12
0:00:45.017,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores.

13
0:00:50.345,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well.

14
0:00:54.297,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And that got me thinking.

15
0:00:56.432,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math,

16
0:00:59.416,000 --> 0:01:03,000
sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals, the area of a parallelogram.

17
0:01:04.668,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But these concepts are not impossible,

18
0:01:07.368,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students

19
0:01:11.502,000 --> 0:01:13,000
could learn the material

20
0:01:14.106,000 --> 0:01:16,000
if they worked hard and long enough.

21
0:01:16.842,000 --> 0:01:18,000
After several more years of teaching,

22
0:01:19.328,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I came to the conclusion that what we need in education

23
0:01:23.086,000 --> 0:01:26,000
is a much better understanding of students and learning

24
0:01:26.57,000 --> 0:01:28,000
from a motivational perspective,

25
0:01:28.911,000 --> 0:01:3,000
from a psychological perspective.

26
0:01:31.815,000 --> 0:01:36,000
In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ.

27
0:01:38.172,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But what if doing well in school and in life

28
0:01:42.048,000 --> 0:01:44,000
depends on much more

29
0:01:44.166,000 --> 0:01:47,000
than your ability to learn quickly and easily?

30
0:01:48.371,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So I left the classroom,

31
0:01:50.321,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist.

32
0:01:53.877,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I started studying kids and adults

33
0:01:56.051,000 --> 0:01:58,000
in all kinds of super challenging settings,

34
0:01:58.908,000 --> 0:02:,000
and in every study my question was,

35
0:02:01.36,000 --> 0:02:03,000
who is successful here and why?

36
0:02:04.384,000 --> 0:02:07,000
My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy.

37
0:02:08.476,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We tried to predict which cadets

38
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
would stay in military training and which would drop out.

39
0:02:14.414,000 --> 0:02:16,000
We went to the National Spelling Bee

40
0:02:16.669,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition.

41
0:02:21.867,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods,

42
0:02:25.947,000 --> 0:02:28,000
asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching

43
0:02:29.388,000 --> 0:02:3,000
by the end of the school year,

44
0:02:31.406,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and of those, who will be the most effective

45
0:02:34.441,000 --> 0:02:36,000
at improving learning outcomes for their students?

46
0:02:37.592,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We partnered with private companies, asking,

47
0:02:39.846,000 --> 0:02:41,000
which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs?

48
0:02:42.565,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And who's going to earn the most money?

49
0:02:44.797,000 --> 0:02:46,000
In all those very different contexts,

50
0:02:47.479,000 --> 0:02:51,000
one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success.

51
0:02:52.464,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And it wasn't social intelligence.

52
0:02:54.662,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It wasn't good looks, physical health,

53
0:02:57.671,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and it wasn't IQ.

54
0:02:59.758,000 --> 0:03:,000
It was grit.

55
0:03:01.899,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals.

56
0:03:06.989,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Grit is having stamina.

57
0:03:09.232,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out,

58
0:03:13.462,000 --> 0:03:16,000
not just for the week, not just for the month,

59
0:03:16.851,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but for years,

60
0:03:18.407,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and working really hard to make that future a reality.

61
0:03:22.969,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint.

62
0:03:28.156,000 --> 0:03:29,000
A few years ago,

63
0:03:29.611,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools.

64
0:03:33.141,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I asked thousands of high school juniors

65
0:03:35.453,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to take grit questionnaires,

66
0:03:37.305,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and then waited around more than a year

67
0:03:39.281,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to see who would graduate.

68
0:03:41.518,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Turns out that grittier kids

69
0:03:43.764,000 --> 0:03:46,000
were significantly more likely to graduate,

70
0:03:46.968,000 --> 0:03:49,000
even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure,

71
0:03:50.754,000 --> 0:03:52,000
things like family income,

72
0:03:53.028,000 --> 0:03:55,000
standardized achievement test scores,

73
0:03:55.774,000 --> 0:03:58,000
even how safe kids felt when they were at school.

74
0:03:59.377,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee

75
0:04:02.338,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that grit matters.

76
0:04:03.476,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It's also in school,

77
0:04:05.441,000 --> 0:04:07,000
especially for kids at risk for dropping out.

78
0:04:09.116,000 --> 0:04:11,000
To me, the most shocking thing about grit

79
0:04:12.098,000 --> 0:04:13,000
is how little we know,

80
0:04:14.081,000 --> 0:04:16,000
how little science knows, about building it.

81
0:04:17.003,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Every day, parents and teachers ask me,

82
0:04:19.278,000 --> 0:04:21,000
"How do I build grit in kids?

83
0:04:21.502,000 --> 0:04:23,000
What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic?

84
0:04:24.753,000 --> 0:04:26,000
How do I keep them motivated for the long run?"

85
0:04:27.86,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The honest answer is,

86
0:04:29.859,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I don't know.

87
0:04:30.96,000 --> 0:04:31,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:32.459,000 --> 0:04:35,000
What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty.

89
0:04:35.522,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Our data show very clearly

90
0:04:37.877,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that there are many talented individuals

91
0:04:40.314,000 --> 0:04:43,000
who simply do not follow through on their commitments.

92
0:04:43.814,000 --> 0:04:47,000
In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated

93
0:04:48.052,000 --> 0:04:51,000
or even inversely related to measures of talent.

94
0:04:52.465,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids

95
0:04:56.584,000 --> 0:04:58,000
is something called "growth mindset."

96
0:04:59.449,000 --> 0:05:02,000
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck,

97
0:05:03.143,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed,

98
0:05:08.265,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that it can change with your effort.

99
0:05:11.44,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Dr. Dweck has shown

100
0:05:12.783,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that when kids read and learn about the brain

101
0:05:15.942,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and how it changes and grows in response to challenge,

102
0:05:19.44,000 --> 0:05:22,000
they're much more likely to persevere when they fail,

103
0:05:23.461,000 --> 0:05:27,000
because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.

104
0:05:29.052,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit.

105
0:05:32.724,000 --> 0:05:33,000
But we need more.

106
0:05:34.825,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And that's where I'm going to end my remarks,

107
0:05:36.945,000 --> 0:05:37,000
because that's where we are.

108
0:05:38.315,000 --> 0:05:4,000
That's the work that stands before us.

109
0:05:40.504,000 --> 0:05:43,000
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions,

110
0:05:44.408,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and we need to test them.

111
0:05:46.512,000 --> 0:05:48,000
We need to measure whether we've been successful,

112
0:05:49.247,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong,

113
0:05:52.977,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to start over again with lessons learned.

114
0:05:56.336,000 --> 0:05:58,000
In other words, we need to be gritty

115
0:05:59.304,000 --> 0:06:01,000
about getting our kids grittier.

116
0:06:02.177,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Thank you.

117
0:06:03.233,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Applause)

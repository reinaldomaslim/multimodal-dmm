1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
We've got a real problem with math education right now.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Basically, no one's very happy.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Those learning it

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
think it's disconnected,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
uninteresting and hard.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Those trying to employ them

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
think they don't know enough.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Governments realize that it's a big deal for our economies,

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but don't know how to fix it.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And teachers are also frustrated.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Yet math is more important to the world

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
than at any point in human history.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So at one end we've got falling interest

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
in education in math,

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and at the other end we've got a more mathematical world,

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
a more quantitative world than we ever have had.

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So what's the problem, why has this chasm opened up,

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and what can we do to fix it?

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Well actually, I think the answer

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
is staring us right in the face:

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Use computers.

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I believe

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that correctly using computers

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
is the silver bullet

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
for making math education work.

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So to explain that,

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and what it looks like in education.

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
See, in the real world

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians.

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It's done by geologists,

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
engineers, biologists,

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
all sorts of different people --

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
modeling and simulation.

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It's actually very popular.

36
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But in education it looks very different --

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
dumbed-down problems, lots of calculating,

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
mostly by hand.

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Lots of things that seem simple

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and not difficult like in the real world,

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
except if you're learning it.

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And another thing about math:

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
math sometimes looks like math --

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
like in this example here --

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and sometimes it doesn't --

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
like "Am I drunk?"

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And then you get an answer that's quantitative in the modern world.

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
You wouldn't have expected that a few years back.

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But now you can find out all about --

50
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
unfortunately, my weight is a little higher than that, but --

51
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
all about what happens.

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So let's zoom out a bit and ask,

53
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
why are we teaching people math?

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
What's the point of teaching people math?

55
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And in particular, why are we teaching them math in general?

56
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Why is it such an important part of education

57
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
as a sort of compulsory subject?

58
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Well, I think there are about three reasons:

59
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
technical jobs

60
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
so critical to the development of our economies,

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
what I call "everyday living" --

62
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to function in the world today,

63
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
you've got to be pretty quantitative,

64
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
much more so than a few years ago:

65
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
figure out your mortgages,

66
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
being skeptical of government statistics, those kinds of things --

67
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and thirdly, what I would call something like

68
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
logical mind training, logical thinking.

69
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Over the years

70
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
we've put so much in society

71
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
into being able to process and think logically. It's part of human society.

72
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It's very important to learn that

73
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
math is a great way to do that.

74
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So let's ask another question.

75
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
What is math?

76
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
What do we mean when we say we're doing math,

77
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
or educating people to do math?

78
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Well, I think it's about four steps, roughly speaking,

79
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
starting with posing the right question.

80
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
What is it that we want to ask? What is it we're trying to find out here?

81
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world,

82
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
beyond virtually any other part of doing math.

83
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
People ask the wrong question,

84
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and surprisingly enough, they get the wrong answer,

85
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
for that reason, if not for others.

86
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So the next thing is take that problem

87
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and turn it from a real world problem

88
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
into a math problem.

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
That's stage two.

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Once you've done that, then there's the computation step.

91
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Turn it from that into some answer

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
in a mathematical form.

93
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And of course, math is very powerful at doing that.

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And then finally, turn it back to the real world.

95
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Did it answer the question?

96
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And also verify it -- crucial step.

97
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Now here's the crazy thing right now.

98
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
In math education,

99
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
we're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time

100
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
teaching people to do step three by hand.

101
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Yet, that's the one step computers can do

102
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
better than any human after years of practice.

103
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Instead, we ought to be using computers

104
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to do step three

105
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and using the students to spend much more effort

106
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
on learning how to do steps one, two and four --

107
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
conceptualizing problems, applying them,

108
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
getting the teacher to run them through how to do that.

109
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
See, crucial point here:

110
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
math is not equal to calculating.

111
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Math is a much broader subject than calculating.

112
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Now it's understandable that this has all got intertwined

113
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
over hundreds of years.

114
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand.

115
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But in the last few decades

116
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
that has totally changed.

117
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject

118
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
that I could ever imagine with computers.

119
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Calculating was typically the limiting step,

120
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and now often it isn't.

121
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So I think in terms of the fact that math

122
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
has been liberated from calculating.

123
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But that math liberation didn't get into education yet.

124
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
See, I think of calculating, in a sense,

125
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
as the machinery of math.

126
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
It's the chore.

127
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can, like to get a machine to do.

128
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It's a means to an end, not an end in itself,

129
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and automation allows us

130
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to have that machinery.

131
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Computers allow us to do that --

132
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and this is not a small problem by any means.

133
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I estimated that, just today, across the world,

134
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
we spent about 106 average world lifetimes

135
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
teaching people how to calculate by hand.

136
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
That's an amazing amount of human endeavor.

137
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So we better be damn sure --

138
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
and by the way, they didn't even have fun doing it, most of them --

139
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
so we better be damn sure

140
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that we know why we're doing that

141
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and it has a real purpose.

142
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I think we should be assuming computers

143
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
for doing the calculating

144
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that.

145
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And I think there are some cases.

146
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
For example: mental arithmetic.

147
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I still do a lot of that, mainly for estimating.

148
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
People say, "Is such and such true?"

149
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And I'll say, "Hmm, not sure." I'll think about it roughly.

150
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
It's still quicker to do that and more practical.

151
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So I think practicality is one case

152
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
where it's worth teaching people by hand.

153
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And then there are certain conceptual things

154
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that can also benefit from hand calculating,

155
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
but I think they're relatively small in number.

156
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
One thing I often ask about

157
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
is ancient Greek and how this relates.

158
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
See, the thing we're doing right now

159
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
is we're forcing people to learn mathematics.

160
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It's a major subject.

161
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I'm not for one minute suggesting that, if people are interested in hand calculating

162
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
or in following their own interests

163
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
in any subject however bizarre --

164
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
they should do that.

165
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
That's absolutely the right thing,

166
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
for people to follow their self-interest.

167
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I was somewhat interested in ancient Greek,

168
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but I don't think that we should force the entire population

169
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to learn a subject like ancient Greek.

170
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I don't think it's warranted.

171
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So I have this distinction between what we're making people do

172
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and the subject that's sort of mainstream

173
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and the subject that, in a sense, people might follow with their own interest

174
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and perhaps even be spiked into doing that.

175
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So what are the issues people bring up with this?

176
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Well one of them is, they say, you need to get the basics first.

177
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
You shouldn't use the machine

178
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
until you get the basics of the subject.

179
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So my usual question is, what do you mean by "basics?"

180
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Basics of what?

181
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Are the basics of driving a car

182
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
learning how to service it, or design it for that matter?

183
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill?

184
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I don't think so.

185
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I think you need to separate the basics of what you're trying to do

186
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
from how it gets done

187
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and the machinery of how it gets done

188
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and automation allows you to make that separation.

189
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
A hundred years ago, it's certainly true that to drive a car

190
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car

191
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things.

192
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But automation in cars

193
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
allowed that to separate,

194
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
so driving is now a quite separate subject, so to speak,

195
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
from engineering of the car

196
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
or learning how to service it.

197
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So automation allows this separation

198
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and also allows -- in the case of driving,

199
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and I believe also in the future case of maths --

200
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
a democratized way of doing that.

201
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It can be spread across a much larger number of people

202
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
who can really work with that.

203
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So there's another thing that comes up with basics.

204
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
People confuse, in my view,

205
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
the order of the invention of the tools

206
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
with the order in which they should use them for teaching.

207
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So just because paper was invented before computers,

208
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
it doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject

209
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
by using paper instead of a computer

210
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to teach mathematics.

211
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
My daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this.

212
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
She enjoys making what she calls "paper laptops."

213
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Laughter)

214
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So I asked her one day, "You know, when I was your age,

215
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I didn't make these.

216
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Why do you think that was?"

217
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And after a second or two, carefully reflecting,

218
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
she said, "No paper?"

219
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
(Laughter)

220
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
If you were born after computers and paper,

221
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
it doesn't really matter which order you're taught with them in,

222
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
you just want to have the best tool.

223
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So another one that comes up is "Computers dumb math down."

224
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
That somehow, if you use a computer,

225
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
it's all mindless button-pushing,

226
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
but if you do it by hand,

227
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
it's all intellectual.

228
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
This one kind of annoys me, I must say.

229
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Do we really believe

230
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that the math that most people are doing in school

231
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
practically today

232
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
is more than applying procedures

233
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
to problems they don't really understand, for reasons they don't get?

234
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I don't think so.

235
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And what's worse, what they're learning there isn't even practically useful anymore.

236
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Might have been 50 years ago, but it isn't anymore.

237
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
When they're out of education, they do it on a computer.

238
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Just to be clear, I think computers can really help with this problem,

239
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
actually make it more conceptual.

240
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Now, of course, like any great tool,

241
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
they can be used completely mindlessly,

242
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
like turning everything into a multimedia show,

243
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
like the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand,

244
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
where the computer was the teacher --

245
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand.

246
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
This is just nuts.

247
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand

248
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that the computer should be doing anyway?

249
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
All backwards.

250
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Let me show you

251
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that you can also make problems harder to calculate.

252
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
See, normally in school,

253
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
you do things like solve quadratic equations.

254
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But you see, when you're using a computer,

255
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
you can just substitute.

256
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
You can make it a quartic equation. Make it kind of harder, calculating-wise.

257
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Same principles applied --

258
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
calculations, harder.

259
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And problems in the real world

260
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
look nutty and horrible like this.

261
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
They've got hair all over them.

262
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
They're not just simple, dumbed-down things that we see in school math.

263
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And think of the outside world.

264
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Do we really believe that engineering and biology

265
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and all of these other things

266
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
that have so benefited from computers and maths

267
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers?

268
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I don't think so -- quite the opposite.

269
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So the problem we've really got in math education

270
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
is not that computers might dumb it down,

271
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
but that we have dumbed-down problems right now.

272
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Well, another issue people bring up

273
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
is somehow that hand calculating procedures

274
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
teach understanding.

275
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So if you go through lots of examples,

276
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
you can get the answer,

277
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
you can understand how the basics of the system work better.

278
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I think there is one thing that I think very valid here,

279
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
which is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important.

280
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
But there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world.

281
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It's called programming.

282
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Programming is how most procedures and processes

283
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
get written down these days,

284
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and it's also a great way

285
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
to engage students much more

286
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and to check they really understand.

287
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
If you really want to check you understand math

288
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
then write a program to do it.

289
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
So programming is the way I think we should be doing that.

290
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
So to be clear, what I really am suggesting here

291
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
is we have a unique opportunity

292
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to make maths both more practical

293
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and more conceptual, simultaneously.

294
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I can't think of any other subject where that's recently been possible.

295
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
It's usually some kind of choice

296
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
between the vocational and the intellectual.

297
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
But I think we can do both at the same time here.

298
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And we open up so many more possibilities.

299
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
You can do so many more problems.

300
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
What I really think we gain from this

301
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
is students getting intuition and experience

302
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
in far greater quantities than they've ever got before.

303
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And experience of harder problems --

304
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
being able to play with the math, interact with it,

305
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
feel it.

306
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
We want people who can feel the math instinctively.

307
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
That's what computers allow us to do.

308
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum.

309
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Traditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate,

310
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
but now we can reorder it

311
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
by how difficult it is to understand the concepts,

312
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
however hard the calculating.

313
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So calculus has traditionally been taught very late.

314
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Why is this?

315
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Well, it's damn hard doing the calculations, that's the problem.

316
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
But actually many of the concepts

317
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
are amenable to a much younger age group.

318
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
This was an example I built for my daughter.

319
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And very, very simple.

320
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
We were talking about what happens

321
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
when you increase the number of sides of a polygon

322
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
to a very large number.

323
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And of course, it turns into a circle.

324
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And by the way, she was also very insistent

325
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
on being able to change the color,

326
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
an important feature for this demonstration.

327
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
You can see that this is a very early step

328
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
into limits and differential calculus

329
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and what happens when you take things to an extreme --

330
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and very small sides and a very large number of sides.

331
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Very simple example.

332
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
That's a view of the world

333
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that we don't usually give people for many, many years after this.

334
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And yet, that's a really important practical view of the world.

335
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
So one of the roadblocks we have

336
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
in moving this agenda forward

337
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
is exams.

338
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
In the end, if we test everyone by hand in exams,

339
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
it's kind of hard to get the curricula changed

340
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
to a point where they can use computers

341
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
during the semesters.

342
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And one of the reasons it's so important --

343
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
so it's very important to get computers in exams.

344
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And then we can ask questions, real questions,

345
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
questions like, what's the best life insurance policy to get? --

346
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
real questions that people have in their everyday lives.

347
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And you see, this isn't some dumbed-down model here.

348
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
This is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens.

349
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
How many years of protection do I need?

350
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
What does that do to the payments

351
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and to the interest rates and so forth?

352
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Now I'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question

353
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
that should be asked in exams,

354
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
but I think it's a very important type

355
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
that right now just gets completely ignored

356
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and is critical for people's real understanding.

357
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
So I believe [there is] critical reform

358
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
we have to do in computer-based math.

359
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
We have got to make sure

360
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
that we can move our economies forward,

361
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and also our societies,

362
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics.

363
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
This isn't some optional extra.

364
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And the country that does this first

365
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
will, in my view, leapfrog others

366
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
in achieving a new economy even,

367
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
an improved economy,

368
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
an improved outlook.

369
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
In fact, I even talk about us moving

370
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
from what we often call now the "knowledge economy"

371
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
to what we might call a "computational knowledge economy,"

372
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
where high-level math is integral to what everyone does

373
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
in the way that knowledge currently is.

374
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
We can engage so many more students with this,

375
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and they can have a better time doing it.

376
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And let's understand:

377
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
this is not an incremental sort of change.

378
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
We're trying to cross the chasm here

379
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
between school math and the real-world math.

380
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And you know if you walk across a chasm,

381
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
you end up making it worse than if you didn't start at all --

382
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
bigger disaster.

383
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
No, what I'm suggesting

384
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
is that we should leap off,

385
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
we should increase our velocity

386
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
so it's high,

387
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and we should leap off one side and go the other --

388
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
of course, having calculated our differential equation very carefully.

389
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
(Laughter)

390
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
So I want to see

391
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
a completely renewed, changed math curriculum

392
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
built from the ground up,

393
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
based on computers being there,

394
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
computers that are now ubiquitous almost.

395
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Calculating machines are everywhere

396
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years.

397
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Now I'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math,

398
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
but what I am sure is

399
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
it's the mainstream subject of the future.

400
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Let's go for it,

401
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and while we're about it,

402
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
let's have a bit of fun,

403
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
for us, for the students and for TED here.

404
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Thanks.

405
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
(Applause)

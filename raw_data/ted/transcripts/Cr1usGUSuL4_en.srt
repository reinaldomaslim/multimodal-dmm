1
0:00:12.462,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I am a Hazara,

2
0:00:14.552,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and the homeland of my people is Afghanistan.

3
0:00:19.381,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Like hundreds of thousands of other Hazara kids,

4
0:00:22.4,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I was born in exile.

5
0:00:25.164,000 --> 0:00:29,000
The ongoing persecution and operation against the Hazaras

6
0:00:29.366,000 --> 0:00:33,000
forced my parents to leave Afghanistan.

7
0:00:33.963,000 --> 0:00:37,000
This persecution has had a long history going back to the late 1800s,

8
0:00:38.374,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and the rule of King Abdur Rahman.

9
0:00:41.301,000 --> 0:00:46,000
He killed 63 percent of the Hazara population.

10
0:00:46.897,000 --> 0:00:48,000
He built minarets with their heads.

11
0:00:49.544,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Many Hazaras were sold into slavery,

12
0:00:51.911,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and many others fled the country for neighboring Iran and Pakistan.

13
0:00:58.204,000 --> 0:01:,000
My parents also fled to Pakistan,

14
0:01:00.92,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and settled in Quetta, where I was born.

15
0:01:03.916,000 --> 0:01:05,000
After the September 11 attack on the Twin Towers,

16
0:01:06.857,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I got a chance to go to Afghanistan

17
0:01:08.645,000 --> 0:01:1,000
for the first time, with foreign journalists.

18
0:01:11.223,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I was only 18, and I got a job working as an interpreter.

19
0:01:15.03,000 --> 0:01:17,000
After four years,

20
0:01:17.213,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I felt it was safe enough to move to Afghanistan permanently,

21
0:01:21.903,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and I was working there as a documentary photographer,

22
0:01:26.523,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and I worked on many stories.

23
0:01:30.769,000 --> 0:01:32,000
One of the most important stories that I did

24
0:01:33.373,000 --> 0:01:37,000
was the dancing boys of Afghanistan.

25
0:01:38.087,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It is a tragic story about an appalling tradition.

26
0:01:42.591,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It involves young kids dancing for warlords

27
0:01:46.052,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and powerful men in the society.

28
0:01:48.141,000 --> 0:01:51,000
These boys are often abducted or bought from their poor parents,

29
0:01:51.902,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and they are put to work as sex slaves.

30
0:01:54.967,000 --> 0:01:56,000
This is Shukur.

31
0:01:57.731,000 --> 0:02:,000
He was kidnapped from Kabul by a warlord.

32
0:02:01.4,000 --> 0:02:02,000
He was taken to another province,

33
0:02:03.372,000 --> 0:02:07,000
where he was forced to work as a sex slave for the warlord and his friends.

34
0:02:08.133,000 --> 0:02:1,000
When this story was published in the Washington Post,

35
0:02:11.058,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I started receiving death threats,

36
0:02:13.38,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and I was forced to leave Afghanistan,

37
0:02:17.118,000 --> 0:02:19,000
as my parents were.

38
0:02:19.51,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Along with my family, I returned back to Quetta.

39
0:02:23.202,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The situation in Quetta had changed dramatically since I left in 2005.

40
0:02:27.614,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Once a peaceful haven for the Hazaras,

41
0:02:30.167,000 --> 0:02:35,000
it had now turned into the most dangerous city in Pakistan.

42
0:02:35.601,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Hazaras are confined into two small areas,

43
0:02:39.176,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and they are marginalized socially, educationally, and financially.

44
0:02:44.029,000 --> 0:02:45,000
This is Nadir.

45
0:02:45.469,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I had known him since my childhood.

46
0:02:47.466,000 --> 0:02:51,000
He was injured when his van was ambushed by terrorists in Quetta.

47
0:02:51.645,000 --> 0:02:54,000
He later died of his injuries.

48
0:02:55.221,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Around 1,600 Hazara members

49
0:02:59.006,000 --> 0:03:02,000
had been killed in various attacks,

50
0:03:02.629,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and around 3,000 of them were injured,

51
0:03:07.527,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and many of them permanently disabled.

52
0:03:10.778,000 --> 0:03:13,000
The attacks on the Hazara community would only get worse,

53
0:03:14.076,000 --> 0:03:16,000
so it was not surprising that many wanted to flee.

54
0:03:16.908,000 --> 0:03:2,000
After Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan,

55
0:03:21.668,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Australia is home to the fourth largest population of Hazaras in the world.

56
0:03:28.332,000 --> 0:03:3,000
When it came time to leave Pakistan,

57
0:03:31.141,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Australia seemed the obvious choice.

58
0:03:33.091,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Financially, only one of us could leave,

59
0:03:35.088,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and it was decided that I would go,

60
0:03:36.946,000 --> 0:03:39,000
in the hope that if I arrived at my destination safely,

61
0:03:40.299,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I could work to get the rest of my family to join me later.

62
0:03:45.291,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We all knew about the risks,

63
0:03:46.87,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and how terrifying the journey is,

64
0:03:49.842,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and I met many people who lost loved ones at sea.

65
0:03:54.416,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It was a desperate decision to take, to leave everything behind,

66
0:03:58.805,000 --> 0:04:,000
and no one makes this decision easily.

67
0:04:01.68,000 --> 0:04:03,000
If I had been able to simply fly to Australia,

68
0:04:03.866,000 --> 0:04:05,000
it would have taken me less than 24 hours.

69
0:04:06.49,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But getting a visa was impossible.

70
0:04:10.576,000 --> 0:04:12,000
My journey was much longer,

71
0:04:12.689,000 --> 0:04:14,000
much more complicated,

72
0:04:14.943,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and certainly more dangerous,

73
0:04:17.989,000 --> 0:04:19,000
traveling to Thailand by air,

74
0:04:20.631,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and then by road and boat to Malaysia and into Indonesia,

75
0:04:25.429,000 --> 0:04:27,000
paying people and smugglers all the way

76
0:04:27.844,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and spending a lot of time hiding

77
0:04:30.584,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and a lot of time in fear of being caught.

78
0:04:34.3,000 --> 0:04:38,000
In Indonesia, I joined a group of seven asylum seekers.

79
0:04:38.687,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We all shared a bedroom

80
0:04:41.241,000 --> 0:04:44,000
in a town outside of Jakarta called Bogor.

81
0:04:45.119,000 --> 0:04:47,000
After spending a week in Bogor,

82
0:04:47.419,000 --> 0:04:5,000
three of my roommates left for the perilous journey,

83
0:04:50.868,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and we got the news two days later

84
0:04:54.7,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that a distressed boat sank in the sea en route to Christmas Island.

85
0:04:59.506,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We found out that our three roommates -- Nawroz, Jaffar and Shabbir --

86
0:05:03.267,000 --> 0:05:04,000
were also among those.

87
0:05:05.218,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Only Jaffar was rescued.

88
0:05:07.656,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Shabbir and Nawroz were never seen again.

89
0:05:11.249,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It made me think,

90
0:05:12.898,000 --> 0:05:14,000
am I doing the right thing?

91
0:05:15.568,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I concluded I really had no other choice but to go on.

92
0:05:19.515,000 --> 0:05:22,000
A few weeks later, we got the call from the people smuggler

93
0:05:23.37,000 --> 0:05:27,000
to alert us that the boat is ready for us to commence our sea journey.

94
0:05:28.06,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Taken in the night towards the main vessel

95
0:05:30.94,000 --> 0:05:31,000
on a motorboat,

96
0:05:32.588,000 --> 0:05:37,000
we boarded an old fishing boat that was already overloaded.

97
0:05:37.603,000 --> 0:05:39,000
There were 93 of us,

98
0:05:39.693,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and we were all below deck.

99
0:05:41.666,000 --> 0:05:43,000
No one was allowed up on the top.

100
0:05:43.919,000 --> 0:05:46,000
We all paid 6,000 dollars each

101
0:05:47.077,000 --> 0:05:49,000
for this part of the trip.

102
0:05:49.166,000 --> 0:05:51,000
The first night and day went smoothly,

103
0:05:51.395,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but by the second night, the weather turned.

104
0:05:54.623,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Waves tossed the boat around, and the timbers groaned.

105
0:05:59.568,000 --> 0:06:03,000
People below deck were crying, praying, recalling their loved ones.

106
0:06:03.91,000 --> 0:06:04,000
They were screaming.

107
0:06:05.652,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It was a terrible moment.

108
0:06:07.811,000 --> 0:06:1,000
It was like a scene from doomsday,

109
0:06:11.758,000 --> 0:06:15,000
or maybe like one of those scenes from those Hollywood movies

110
0:06:16.583,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that shows that everything is breaking apart

111
0:06:19.788,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and the world is just ending.

112
0:06:22.225,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It was happening to us for real.

113
0:06:24.849,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We didn't have any hope.

114
0:06:29.192,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Our boat was floating like a matchbox on the water

115
0:06:32.72,000 --> 0:06:34,000
without any control.

116
0:06:34.856,000 --> 0:06:37,000
The waves were much higher than our boat,

117
0:06:38.618,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and the water poured in faster than the motor pumps could take it out.

118
0:06:44.655,000 --> 0:06:46,000
We all lost hope.

119
0:06:47.511,000 --> 0:06:49,000
We thought, this is the end.

120
0:06:49.95,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We were watching our deaths,

121
0:06:51.876,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and I was documenting it.

122
0:06:54.268,000 --> 0:06:55,000
The captain told us

123
0:06:56.219,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that we are not going to make it,

124
0:06:58.586,000 --> 0:07:01,000
we have to turn back the boat.

125
0:07:01.767,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We went on the deck

126
0:07:03.834,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and turned our torches on and off

127
0:07:06.366,000 --> 0:07:1,000
to attract the attention of any passing boat.

128
0:07:11.265,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We kept trying to attract their attention by waving our life jackets and whistling.

129
0:07:18.649,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Eventually, we made it to a small island.

130
0:07:22.084,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Our boat crashing onto the rocks,

131
0:07:25.335,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I slipped into the water

132
0:07:27.378,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and destroyed my camera, whatever I had documented.

133
0:07:31.025,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But luckily, the memory card survived.

134
0:07:36.791,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It was a thick forest.

135
0:07:39.206,000 --> 0:07:44,000
We all split up into many groups as we argued over what to do next.

136
0:07:44.965,000 --> 0:07:46,000
We were all scared and confused.

137
0:07:47.333,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Then, after spending the night on the beach,

138
0:07:50.63,000 --> 0:07:52,000
we found a jetty and coconuts.

139
0:07:53.253,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We hailed a boat from a nearby resort,

140
0:07:56.249,000 --> 0:08:,000
and then were quickly handed over to Indonesian water police.

141
0:08:00.498,000 --> 0:08:03,000
At Serang Detention Center,

142
0:08:04.1,000 --> 0:08:09,000
an immigration officer came and furtively strip-searched us.

143
0:08:09.158,000 --> 0:08:12,000
He took our mobile, my $300 cash,

144
0:08:12.526,000 --> 0:08:15,000
our shoes that we should not be able to escape,

145
0:08:15.938,000 --> 0:08:21,000
but we kept watching the guards, checking their movements,

146
0:08:21.999,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and around 4 a.m. when they sat around a fire,

147
0:08:25.842,000 --> 0:08:28,000
we removed two glass layers from an outside facing window

148
0:08:29.396,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and slipped through.

149
0:08:30.915,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We climbed a tree next to an outer wall that was topped with the shards of glass.

150
0:08:35.744,000 --> 0:08:37,000
We put the pillow on that

151
0:08:38.043,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and wrapped our forearms with bedsheets

152
0:08:41.573,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and climbed the wall,

153
0:08:43.671,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and we ran away with bare feet.

154
0:08:47.418,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I was free,

155
0:08:49.207,000 --> 0:08:51,000
with an uncertain future,

156
0:08:51.924,000 --> 0:08:52,000
no money.

157
0:08:53.734,000 --> 0:09:,000
The only thing I had was the memory card with the pictures and footage.

158
0:09:00.858,000 --> 0:09:03,000
When my documentary was aired on SBS Dateline,

159
0:09:04.275,000 --> 0:09:06,000
many of my friends came to know about my situation,

160
0:09:06.854,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and they tried to help me.

161
0:09:08.71,000 --> 0:09:11,000
They did not allow me to take any other boat to risk my life.

162
0:09:12.448,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I also decided to stay in Indonesia and process my case through UNHCR,

163
0:09:16.953,000 --> 0:09:19,000
but I was really afraid that I would end up in Indonesia

164
0:09:20.807,000 --> 0:09:23,000
for many years doing nothing and unable to work,

165
0:09:24.461,000 --> 0:09:27,000
like every other asylum seeker.

166
0:09:27.706,000 --> 0:09:3,000
But it had happened to be a little bit different with me.

167
0:09:30.93,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I was lucky.

168
0:09:35.923,000 --> 0:09:39,000
My contacts worked to expedite my case through UNHCR,

169
0:09:40.381,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and I got resettled in Australia in May 2013.

170
0:09:45.119,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Not every asylum seeker is lucky like me.

171
0:09:49.298,000 --> 0:09:56,000
It is really difficult to live a life with an uncertain fate, in limbo.

172
0:09:56.588,000 --> 0:09:59,000
The issue of asylum seekers in Australia

173
0:10:00.419,000 --> 0:10:02,000
has been so extremely politicized

174
0:10:03.137,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that it has lost its human face.

175
0:10:06.271,000 --> 0:10:12,000
The asylum seekers have been demonized and then presented to the people.

176
0:10:12.372,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I hope my story and the story of other Hazaras

177
0:10:16.907,000 --> 0:10:19,000
could shed some light to show the people

178
0:10:19.96,000 --> 0:10:23,000
how these people are suffering in their countries of origin,

179
0:10:24.261,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and how they suffer,

180
0:10:28.18,000 --> 0:10:32,000
why they risk their lives to seek asylum.

181
0:10:32.916,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Thank you.

182
0:10:34.426,000 --> 0:10:35,000
(Applause)

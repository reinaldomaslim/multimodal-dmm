1
0:00:13.548,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So, let me thank you for the opportunity to talk about

2
0:00:17.31,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the biggest international story of your professional lifetime,

3
0:00:22.402,000 --> 0:00:25,000
which is also the most important international challenge

4
0:00:26.327,000 --> 0:00:29,000
the world will face for as far as the eye can see.

5
0:00:29.514,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The story, of course, is the rise of China.

6
0:00:32.106,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Never before have so many people risen so far so fast,

7
0:00:35.939,000 --> 0:00:36,000
on so many different dimensions.

8
0:00:38.336,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The challenge is the impact of China's rise --

9
0:00:42.497,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the discombobulation this will cause the Unites States

10
0:00:46.8,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and the international order,

11
0:00:48.617,000 --> 0:00:52,000
of which the US has been the principal architect and guardian.

12
0:00:54.109,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The past 100 years have been what historians now call an "American Century."

13
0:00:58.568,000 --> 0:01:,000
Americans have become accustomed to their place

14
0:01:01.093,000 --> 0:01:03,000
at the top of every pecking order.

15
0:01:03.862,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So the very idea of another country

16
0:01:06.8,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that could be as big and strong as the US -- or bigger --

17
0:01:10.839,000 --> 0:01:13,000
strikes many Americans as an assault on who they are.

18
0:01:18.212,000 --> 0:01:22,000
For perspective on what we're now seeing in this rivalry,

19
0:01:22.657,000 --> 0:01:25,000
it's useful to locate it on the larger map of history.

20
0:01:27.089,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The past 500 years have seen 16 cases

21
0:01:30.855,000 --> 0:01:33,000
in which a rising power threatened to displace a ruling power.

22
0:01:34.918,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Twelve of those ended in war.

23
0:01:39.434,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So just in November, we'll all pause to mark the 100th anniversary

24
0:01:45.855,000 --> 0:01:49,000
of the final day of a war that became so encompassing,

25
0:01:50.387,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that it required historians to create an entirely new category: world war.

26
0:01:55.72,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So, on the 11th hour of the 11th day

27
0:01:59.369,000 --> 0:02:02,000
of the 11th month in 1918,

28
0:02:03.085,000 --> 0:02:06,000
the guns of World War I fell silent,

29
0:02:06.291,000 --> 0:02:09,000
but 20 million individuals lay dead.

30
0:02:12.511,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I know that this is a sophisticated audience,

31
0:02:14.956,000 --> 0:02:15,000
so you know about the rise of China.

32
0:02:17.403,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I'm going to focus, therefore, on the impact of China's rise,

33
0:02:21.839,000 --> 0:02:24,000
on the US, on the international order

34
0:02:25.22,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and on the prospects for war and peace.

35
0:02:28.402,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But having taught at Harvard over many years,

36
0:02:30.569,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I've learned that from time to time, it's useful to take a short pause,

37
0:02:34.594,000 --> 0:02:36,000
just to make sure we're all on the same page.

38
0:02:37.254,000 --> 0:02:39,000
The way I do this is, I call a time-out,

39
0:02:39.626,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I give students a pop quiz -- ungraded, of course.

40
0:02:43.141,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So, let's try this. Time-out, pop quiz.

41
0:02:46.173,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Question:

42
0:02:47.807,000 --> 0:02:51,000
forty years ago, 1978, China sets out on its march to the market.

43
0:02:53.14,000 --> 0:02:57,000
At that point, what percentage of China's one billion citizens

44
0:02:58.029,000 --> 0:03:02,000
were struggling to survive on less than two dollars a day?

45
0:03:02.704,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Take a guess -- 25 percent?

46
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Fifty?

47
0:03:07.053,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Seventy-five?

48
0:03:09.998,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Ninety.

49
0:03:12.284,000 --> 0:03:13,000
What do you think?

50
0:03:14.895,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Ninety.

51
0:03:16.125,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Nine out of every 10 on less than two dollars a day.

52
0:03:21.911,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Twenty eighteen, 40 years later.

53
0:03:24.427,000 --> 0:03:25,000
What about the numbers?

54
0:03:25.895,000 --> 0:03:26,000
What's your bet?

55
0:03:27.442,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Take a look.

56
0:03:33.125,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Fewer than one in 100 today.

57
0:03:36.498,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And China's president has promised that within the next three years,

58
0:03:39.731,000 --> 0:03:42,000
those last tens of millions will have been raised up

59
0:03:42.938,000 --> 0:03:43,000
above that threshold.

60
0:03:44.958,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So it's a miracle, actually, in our lifetime.

61
0:03:48.188,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Hard to believe.

62
0:03:49.402,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But brute facts are even harder to ignore.

63
0:03:53.069,000 --> 0:03:56,000
A nation that didn't even appear on any of the international league tables

64
0:03:56.579,000 --> 0:03:57,000
25 years ago

65
0:03:57.919,000 --> 0:03:58,000
has soared,

66
0:03:59.395,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to rival -- and in some areas, surpass -- the United States.

67
0:04:06.964,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Thus, the challenge that will shape our world:

68
0:04:10.924,000 --> 0:04:13,000
a seemingly unstoppable rising China

69
0:04:14.442,000 --> 0:04:18,000
accelerating towards an apparently immovable ruling US,

70
0:04:19.077,000 --> 0:04:22,000
on course for what could be the grandest collision in history.

71
0:04:24.323,000 --> 0:04:26,000
To help us get our minds around this challenge,

72
0:04:27.275,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I'm going to introduce you to a great thinker,

73
0:04:31.132,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I'm going to present a big idea,

74
0:04:33.887,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and I'm going to pose a most consequential question.

75
0:04:38.244,000 --> 0:04:4,000
The great thinker is Thucydides.

76
0:04:41.006,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Now, I know his name is a mouthful,

77
0:04:43.344,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and some people have trouble pronouncing it.

78
0:04:45.486,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So, let's do it, one, two, three, together:

79
0:04:47.53,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Thucydides.

80
0:04:48.927,000 --> 0:04:5,000
One more time: Thucydides.

81
0:04:51.863,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So who was Thucydides?

82
0:04:53.942,000 --> 0:04:55,000
He was the father and founder of history.

83
0:04:56.903,000 --> 0:04:58,000
He wrote the first-ever history book.

84
0:04:59.069,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It's titled "The History of the Peloponnesian War,"

85
0:05:03.204,000 --> 0:05:06,000
about the war in Greece, 2500 years ago.

86
0:05:07.276,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So if nothing else today, you can tweet your friends,

87
0:05:10.49,000 --> 0:05:11,000
"I met a great thinker.

88
0:05:12.236,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And I can even pronounce his name: Thucydides."

89
0:05:16.546,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So, about this war that destroyed classical Greece,

90
0:05:21.268,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Thucydides wrote famously:

91
0:05:24.561,000 --> 0:05:3,000
"It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta

92
0:05:31.483,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that made the war inevitable."

93
0:05:34.618,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So the rise of one

94
0:05:36.879,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and the reaction of the other

95
0:05:39.184,000 --> 0:05:42,000
create a toxic cocktail of pride,

96
0:05:43.207,000 --> 0:05:45,000
arrogance, paranoia,

97
0:05:46.025,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that drug them both to war.

98
0:05:50.177,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Which brings me to the big idea:

99
0:05:53.09,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Thucydides's Trap.

100
0:05:55.701,000 --> 0:05:58,000
"Thucydides's Trap" is a term I coined several years ago,

101
0:05:59.006,000 --> 0:06:01,000
to make vivid Thucydides's insight.

102
0:06:02.569,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Thucydides's Trap is the dangerous dynamic that occurs

103
0:06:06.823,000 --> 0:06:09,000
when a rising power threatens to displace a ruling power,

104
0:06:10.68,000 --> 0:06:11,000
like Athens --

105
0:06:12.428,000 --> 0:06:16,000
or Germany 100 years ago, or China today --

106
0:06:16.95,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and their impact on Sparta,

107
0:06:19.355,000 --> 0:06:22,000
or Great Britain 100 years ago, or the US today.

108
0:06:24.205,000 --> 0:06:25,000
As Henry Kissinger has said,

109
0:06:26.149,000 --> 0:06:3,000
once you get this idea, this concept of Thucydides's Trap in your head,

110
0:06:30.998,000 --> 0:06:31,000
it will provide a lens

111
0:06:32.701,000 --> 0:06:35,000
for helping you look through the news and noise of the day

112
0:06:36.284,000 --> 0:06:38,000
to understand what's actually going on.

113
0:06:40.649,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So, to the most consequential question about our world today:

114
0:06:46.863,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Are we going to follow in the footsteps of history?

115
0:06:51.466,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Or can we, through a combination of imagination and common sense

116
0:06:57.505,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and courage

117
0:06:58.886,000 --> 0:07:02,000
find a way to manage this rivalry

118
0:07:03.326,000 --> 0:07:05,000
without a war nobody wants,

119
0:07:06.318,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and everybody knows would be catastrophic?

120
0:07:10.35,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Give me five minutes to unpack this,

121
0:07:12.427,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and later this afternoon, when the next news story pops up for you

122
0:07:17.427,000 --> 0:07:2,000
about China doing this, or the US reacting like that,

123
0:07:20.861,000 --> 0:07:23,000
you will be able to have a better understanding of what's going on

124
0:07:24.304,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and even to explain it to your friends.

125
0:07:27.678,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So as we saw with this flipping the pyramid of poverty,

126
0:07:32.203,000 --> 0:07:33,000
China has actually soared.

127
0:07:34.456,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It's meteoric.

128
0:07:36.354,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Former Czech president, Vaclav Havel, I think, put it best.

129
0:07:39.441,000 --> 0:07:43,000
He said, "All this has happened so fast, we haven't yet had time to be astonished."

130
0:07:44.228,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Laughter)

131
0:07:46.672,000 --> 0:07:49,000
To remind myself how astonished I should be,

132
0:07:50.466,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I occasionally look out the window in my office in Cambridge

133
0:07:54.68,000 --> 0:07:56,000
at this bridge, which goes across the Charles River,

134
0:07:57.45,000 --> 0:07:59,000
between the Kennedy School and Harvard Business School.

135
0:08:00.933,000 --> 0:08:03,000
In 2012, the State of Massachusetts said they were going to renovate this bridge,

136
0:08:04.888,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and it would take two years.

137
0:08:07.053,000 --> 0:08:09,000
In 2014, they said it wasn't finished.

138
0:08:10.41,000 --> 0:08:12,000
In 2015, they said it would take one more year.

139
0:08:13.363,000 --> 0:08:14,000
In 2016, they said it's not finished,

140
0:08:15.165,000 --> 0:08:17,000
we're not going to tell you when it's going to be finished.

141
0:08:18.004,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Finally, last year, it was finished -- three times over budget.

142
0:08:22.307,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Now, compare this to a similar bridge that I drove across last month in Beijing.

143
0:08:27.839,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It's called the Sanyuan Bridge.

144
0:08:30.284,000 --> 0:08:33,000
In 2015, the Chinese decided they wanted to renovate that bridge.

145
0:08:33.964,000 --> 0:08:35,000
It actually has twice as many lanes of traffic.

146
0:08:37.354,000 --> 0:08:39,000
How long did it take for them to complete the project?

147
0:08:40.663,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Twenty fifteen, what do you bet?

148
0:08:44.649,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Take a guess -- OK, three --

149
0:08:46.712,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Take a look.

150
0:08:52.748,000 --> 0:08:55,000
(Laughter)

151
0:09:00.236,000 --> 0:09:02,000
The answer is 43 hours.

152
0:09:02.704,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Audience: Wow!)

153
0:09:08.63,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Laughter)

154
0:09:16.039,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Graham Allison: Now, of course, that couldn't happen in New York.

155
0:09:19.196,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Laughter)

156
0:09:21.482,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Behind this speed in execution is a purpose-driven leader

157
0:09:26.677,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and a government that works.

158
0:09:29.657,000 --> 0:09:32,000
The most ambitious and most competent leader

159
0:09:32.779,000 --> 0:09:35,000
on the international stage today is Chinese President Xi Jinping.

160
0:09:36.284,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And he's made no secret about what he wants.

161
0:09:39.434,000 --> 0:09:41,000
As he said when he became president six years ago,

162
0:09:42.434,000 --> 0:09:45,000
his goal is to make China great again --

163
0:09:46.312,000 --> 0:09:47,000
(Laughter)

164
0:09:48.173,000 --> 0:09:52,000
a banner he raised long before Donald Trump picked up a version of this.

165
0:09:53.919,000 --> 0:09:59,000
To that end, Xi Jinping has announced specific targets for specific dates:

166
0:10:00.797,000 --> 0:10:04,000
2025, 2035, 2049.

167
0:10:06.257,000 --> 0:10:12,000
By 2025, China means to be the dominant power

168
0:10:12.601,000 --> 0:10:16,000
in the major market in 10 leading technologies,

169
0:10:16.91,000 --> 0:10:19,000
including driverless cars, robots,

170
0:10:19.958,000 --> 0:10:21,000
artificial intelligence, quantum computing.

171
0:10:23.204,000 --> 0:10:27,000
By 2035, China means to be the innovation leader

172
0:10:28.1,000 --> 0:10:3,000
across all the advanced technologies.

173
0:10:31.427,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And by 2049, which is the 100th anniversary

174
0:10:35.469,000 --> 0:10:37,000
of the founding of the People's Republic,

175
0:10:37.934,000 --> 0:10:4,000
China means to be unambiguously number one,

176
0:10:41.022,000 --> 0:10:45,000
including, [says] Xi Jinping, an army that he calls "Fight and Win."

177
0:10:47.498,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So these are audacious goals, but as you can see,

178
0:10:50.252,000 --> 0:10:53,000
China is already well on its way

179
0:10:53.363,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to these objectives.

180
0:10:55.387,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And we should remember how fast our world is changing.

181
0:10:59.054,000 --> 0:11:,000
Thirty years ago,

182
0:11:00.665,000 --> 0:11:03,000
the World Wide Web had not yet even been invented.

183
0:11:05.086,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Who will feel the impact of this rise of China most directly?

184
0:11:10.399,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Obviously, the current number one.

185
0:11:13.185,000 --> 0:11:15,000
As China gets bigger and stronger and richer,

186
0:11:15.59,000 --> 0:11:17,000
technologically more advanced,

187
0:11:17.614,000 --> 0:11:21,000
it will inevitably bump up against American positions and prerogatives.

188
0:11:23.495,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Now, for red-blooded Americans --

189
0:11:26.27,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and especially for red-necked Americans like me; I'm from North Carolina --

190
0:11:30.707,000 --> 0:11:32,000
there's something wrong with this picture.

191
0:11:33.689,000 --> 0:11:35,000
The USA means number one, that's who we are.

192
0:11:38.721,000 --> 0:11:41,000
But again, to repeat: brute facts are hard to ignore.

193
0:11:43.673,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Four years ago, Senator John McCain asked me to testify about this

194
0:11:47.609,000 --> 0:11:5,000
to his Senate Armed Services Committee.

195
0:11:51.299,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And I made for them a chart that you can see,

196
0:11:55.06,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that said, compare the US and China

197
0:11:58.133,000 --> 0:12:02,000
to kids on opposite ends of a seesaw on a playground,

198
0:12:02.673,000 --> 0:12:05,000
each represented by the size of their economy.

199
0:12:05.72,000 --> 0:12:09,000
As late as 2004, China was just half our size.

200
0:12:11.22,000 --> 0:12:14,000
By 2014, its GDP was equal to ours.

201
0:12:14.91,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And on the current trajectory, by 2024, it will be half again larger.

202
0:12:22.744,000 --> 0:12:26,000
The consequences of this tectonic change will be felt everywhere.

203
0:12:27.317,000 --> 0:12:29,000
For example, in the current trade conflict,

204
0:12:29.633,000 --> 0:12:31,000
China is already the number one trading partner

205
0:12:32.265,000 --> 0:12:35,000
of all the major Asian countries.

206
0:12:36.776,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Which brings us back to our Greek historian.

207
0:12:40.331,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Harvard's "Thucydides's Trap Case File" has reviewed the last 500 years of history

208
0:12:46.077,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and found 16 cases in which a rising power

209
0:12:49.855,000 --> 0:12:5,000
threatened to displace a ruling power.

210
0:12:52.344,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Twelve of these ended in war.

211
0:12:57.938,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And the tragedy of this is that in very few of these

212
0:13:03.255,000 --> 0:13:05,000
did either of the protagonists want a war;

213
0:13:07.236,000 --> 0:13:1,000
few of these wars were initiated by either the rising power

214
0:13:10.562,000 --> 0:13:11,000
or the ruling power.

215
0:13:11.945,000 --> 0:13:12,000
So how does this work?

216
0:13:13.657,000 --> 0:13:17,000
What happens is, a third party's provocation

217
0:13:17.926,000 --> 0:13:19,000
forces one or the other to react,

218
0:13:21.49,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and that sets in motion a spiral,

219
0:13:24.259,000 --> 0:13:26,000
which drags the two somewhere they don't want to go.

220
0:13:27.152,000 --> 0:13:29,000
If that seems crazy, it is.

221
0:13:29.366,000 --> 0:13:3,000
But it's life.

222
0:13:31.009,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Remember World War I.

223
0:13:33.953,000 --> 0:13:35,000
The provocation in that case

224
0:13:36.839,000 --> 0:13:39,000
was the assassination of a second-level figure,

225
0:13:40.212,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Archduke Franz Ferdinand,

226
0:13:43.14,000 --> 0:13:46,000
which then led the Austro-Hungarian emperor

227
0:13:46.228,000 --> 0:13:48,000
to issue an ultimatum to Serbia,

228
0:13:48.339,000 --> 0:13:49,000
they dragged in the various allies,

229
0:13:50.117,000 --> 0:13:52,000
within two months, all of Europe was at war.

230
0:13:54.823,000 --> 0:13:57,000
So imagine if Thucydides were watching planet Earth today.

231
0:13:58.777,000 --> 0:13:59,000
What would he say?

232
0:14:01.118,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Could he find a more appropriate leading man for the ruling power

233
0:14:05.983,000 --> 0:14:06,000
than Donald J Trump?

234
0:14:07.442,000 --> 0:14:08,000
(Laughter)

235
0:14:08.831,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Or a more apt lead for the rising power than Xi Jinping?

236
0:14:15.228,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And he would scratch his head

237
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and certainly say he couldn't think of more colorful provocateur

238
0:14:22.648,000 --> 0:14:24,000
than North Korea's Kim Jong-un.

239
0:14:26.629,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Each seems determined to play his assigned part

240
0:14:30.295,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and is right on script.

241
0:14:33.311,000 --> 0:14:37,000
So finally, we conclude again with the most consequential question,

242
0:14:37.839,000 --> 0:14:39,000
the question that will have the gravest consequences

243
0:14:40.752,000 --> 0:14:42,000
for the rest of our lives:

244
0:14:45.211,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Are Americans and Chinese going to let the forces of history drive us to a war

245
0:14:51.069,000 --> 0:14:53,000
that would be catastrophic for both?

246
0:14:54.099,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Or can we summon the imagination and courage

247
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
to find a way to survive together,

248
0:15:00.355,000 --> 0:15:03,000
to share the leadership in the 21st century,

249
0:15:03.386,000 --> 0:15:07,000
or, as Xi Jinping [said], to create a new form of great power relations?

250
0:15:08.371,000 --> 0:15:1,000
That's the issue I've been pursuing passionately

251
0:15:10.927,000 --> 0:15:11,000
for the last two years.

252
0:15:12.53,000 --> 0:15:14,000
I've had the opportunity to talk and, indeed, to listen

253
0:15:15.498,000 --> 0:15:17,000
to leaders of all the relevant governments --

254
0:15:17.68,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Beijing, Washington, Seoul, Tokyo --

255
0:15:21.633,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and to thought leaders across the spectrum of both the arts and business.

256
0:15:26.21,000 --> 0:15:28,000
I wish I had more to report.

257
0:15:28.4,000 --> 0:15:32,000
The good news is that leaders are increasingly aware

258
0:15:32.472,000 --> 0:15:34,000
of this Thucydidean dynamic

259
0:15:34.846,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and the dangers that it poses.

260
0:15:37.227,000 --> 0:15:39,000
The bad news is that nobody has a feasible plan

261
0:15:39.969,000 --> 0:15:41,000
for escaping history as usual.

262
0:15:43.299,000 --> 0:15:45,000
So it's clear to me that we need some ideas

263
0:15:45.934,000 --> 0:15:48,000
outside the box of conventional statecraft --

264
0:15:49.919,000 --> 0:15:52,000
indeed, from another page or another space --

265
0:15:54.707,000 --> 0:15:56,000
which is what brings me to TED today

266
0:15:56.953,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and which brings me to a request.

267
0:16:01.326,000 --> 0:16:06,000
This audience includes many of the most creative minds on the planet,

268
0:16:06.719,000 --> 0:16:07,000
who get up in the morning and think

269
0:16:08.426,000 --> 0:16:1,000
not only about how to manage the world we have,

270
0:16:11.195,000 --> 0:16:13,000
but how to create worlds that should be.

271
0:16:14.633,000 --> 0:16:19,000
So I'm hopeful that as this sinks in and as you reflect on it,

272
0:16:19.776,000 --> 0:16:23,000
some of you are going to have some bold ideas, actually some wild ideas,

273
0:16:23.829,000 --> 0:16:26,000
that when we find, will make a difference in this space.

274
0:16:27.498,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And just to remind you if you do,

275
0:16:29.934,000 --> 0:16:3,000
this won't be the first time.

276
0:16:32.518,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Let me remind you of what happened right after World War II.

277
0:16:36.875,000 --> 0:16:39,000
A remarkable group of Americans and Europeans and others,

278
0:16:40.518,000 --> 0:16:43,000
not just from government, but from the world of culture and business,

279
0:16:44.283,000 --> 0:16:47,000
engaged in a collective surge of imagination.

280
0:16:48.498,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And what they imagined and what they created

281
0:16:51.442,000 --> 0:16:53,000
was a new international order,

282
0:16:54.711,000 --> 0:16:57,000
the order that's allowed you and me to live our lives, all of our lives,

283
0:16:58.521,000 --> 0:16:59,000
without great power war

284
0:17:01.307,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and with more prosperity than was ever seen before on the planet.

285
0:17:05.804,000 --> 0:17:06,000
So, a remarkable story.

286
0:17:08.041,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Interestingly, every pillar of this project that produced these results,

287
0:17:13.955,000 --> 0:17:14,000
when first proposed,

288
0:17:15.569,000 --> 0:17:17,000
was rejected by the foreign policy establishment

289
0:17:18.284,000 --> 0:17:21,000
as naive or unrealistic.

290
0:17:21.919,000 --> 0:17:22,000
My favorite is the Marshall Plan.

291
0:17:24.838,000 --> 0:17:26,000
After World War II, Americans felt exhausted.

292
0:17:27.56,000 --> 0:17:29,000
They had demobilized 10 million troops,

293
0:17:29.602,000 --> 0:17:32,000
they were focused on an urgent domestic agenda.

294
0:17:32.807,000 --> 0:17:36,000
But as people began to appreciate how devastated Europe was

295
0:17:37.027,000 --> 0:17:39,000
and how aggressive Soviet communism was,

296
0:17:39.805,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Americans eventually decided to tax themselves

297
0:17:43.749,000 --> 0:17:46,000
a percent and a half of GDP every year for four years

298
0:17:47.586,000 --> 0:17:5,000
and send that money to Europe to help reconstruct these countries,

299
0:17:51.468,000 --> 0:17:53,000
including Germany and Italy,

300
0:17:54.341,000 --> 0:17:56,000
whose troops had just been killing Americans.

301
0:17:57.737,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Amazing.

302
0:17:59.792,000 --> 0:18:01,000
This also created the United Nations.

303
0:18:02.15,000 --> 0:18:03,000
Amazing.

304
0:18:03.896,000 --> 0:18:05,000
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

305
0:18:06.906,000 --> 0:18:07,000
The World Bank.

306
0:18:08.231,000 --> 0:18:09,000
NATO.

307
0:18:09.44,000 --> 0:18:12,000
All of these elements of an order for peace and prosperity.

308
0:18:13.365,000 --> 0:18:16,000
So, in a word, what we need to do is do it again.

309
0:18:17.919,000 --> 0:18:22,000
And I think now we need a surge of imagination, creativity,

310
0:18:23.102,000 --> 0:18:25,000
informed by history,

311
0:18:26.077,000 --> 0:18:3,000
for, as the philosopher Santayana reminded us,

312
0:18:30.586,000 --> 0:18:34,000
in the end, only those who refuse to study history

313
0:18:34.666,000 --> 0:18:35,000
are condemned to repeat it.

314
0:18:37.087,000 --> 0:18:38,000
Thank you.

315
0:18:38.27,000 --> 0:18:41,000
(Applause)

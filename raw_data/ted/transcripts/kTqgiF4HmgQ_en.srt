2
0:00:15.518,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So if someone asked you

3
0:00:17.339,000 --> 0:00:19,000
for the three words that would sum up

4
0:00:20.101,000 --> 0:00:23,000
your reputation, what would you say?

5
0:00:23.983,000 --> 0:00:25,000
How would people describe your judgment,

6
0:00:26.378,000 --> 0:00:29,000
your knowledge, your behaviors, in different situations?

7
0:00:30.135,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Today I'd like to explore with you

8
0:00:32.502,000 --> 0:00:33,000
why the answer to this question

9
0:00:34.174,000 --> 0:00:36,000
will become profoundly important

10
0:00:36.315,000 --> 0:00:4,000
in an age where reputation will be your most valuable asset.

11
0:00:40.912,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I'd like to start by introducing you to someone

12
0:00:43.495,000 --> 0:00:46,000
whose life has been changed by a marketplace

13
0:00:47.097,000 --> 0:00:49,000
fueled by reputation.

14
0:00:49.2,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Sebastian Sandys has been a bed and breakfast host

15
0:00:52.29,000 --> 0:00:54,000
on Airbnb since 2008.

16
0:00:54.829,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I caught up with him recently, where, over the course

17
0:00:57.76,000 --> 0:00:59,000
of several cups of tea, he told me how

18
0:01:00.624,000 --> 0:01:02,000
hosting guests from all over the world

19
0:01:03.007,000 --> 0:01:04,000
has enriched his life.

20
0:01:04.474,000 --> 0:01:07,000
More than 50 people have come to stay in the 18th-century

21
0:01:07.847,000 --> 0:01:1,000
watchhouse he lives in with his cat, Squeak.

22
0:01:10.879,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now, I mention Squeak because Sebastian's first guest

23
0:01:15.311,000 --> 0:01:18,000
happened to see a rather large mouse run across the kitchen,

24
0:01:19.262,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and she promised that she would refrain from leaving

25
0:01:21.855,000 --> 0:01:24,000
a bad review on one condition: he got a cat.

26
0:01:25.277,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And so Sebastian bought Squeak to protect his reputation.

27
0:01:29.344,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now, as many of you know, Airbnb is a peer-to-peer

28
0:01:32.503,000 --> 0:01:35,000
marketplace that matches people who have space to rent

29
0:01:36.454,000 --> 0:01:38,000
with people who are looking for a place to stay

30
0:01:39.239,000 --> 0:01:41,000
in over 192 countries.

31
0:01:41.926,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The places being rented out are things that you might

32
0:01:44.616,000 --> 0:01:46,000
expect, like spare rooms and holiday homes,

33
0:01:47.448,000 --> 0:01:49,000
but part of the magic is the unique places

34
0:01:50.021,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that you can now access: treehouses, teepees,

35
0:01:53.959,000 --> 0:01:55,000
airplane hangars, igloos.

36
0:01:56.051,000 --> 0:01:59,000
If you don't like the hotel, there's a castle down the road

37
0:01:59.51,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that you can rent for 5,000 dollars a night.

38
0:02:02.343,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It's a fantastic example of how technology

39
0:02:05.691,000 --> 0:02:06,000
is creating a market

40
0:02:07.407,000 --> 0:02:09,000
for things that never had a marketplace before.

41
0:02:09.906,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Now let me show you these heat maps of Paris

42
0:02:13.037,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to see how insanely fast it's growing.

43
0:02:15.595,000 --> 0:02:17,000
This image here is from 2008.

44
0:02:18.259,000 --> 0:02:21,000
The pink dots represent host properties.

45
0:02:21.978,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Even four years ago, letting strangers stay in your home

46
0:02:25.971,000 --> 0:02:27,000
seemed like a crazy idea.

47
0:02:28.463,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Now the same view in 2010.

48
0:02:30.684,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And now, 2012.

49
0:02:33.486,000 --> 0:02:38,000
There is an Airbnb host on almost every main street in Paris.

50
0:02:38.625,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Now, what's happening here is people are realizing

51
0:02:43.256,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the power of technology to unlock the idling capacity

52
0:02:47.617,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and value of all kinds of assets,

53
0:02:50.535,000 --> 0:02:53,000
from skills to spaces to material possessions,

54
0:02:53.993,000 --> 0:02:56,000
in ways and on a scale never possible before.

55
0:02:57.472,000 --> 0:03:,000
It's an economy and culture called collaborative consumption,

56
0:03:00.696,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and, through it, people like Sebastian

57
0:03:03.488,000 --> 0:03:05,000
are becoming micro-entrepreneurs.

58
0:03:05.559,000 --> 0:03:07,000
They're empowered to make money and save money

59
0:03:08.257,000 --> 0:03:1,000
from their existing assets.

60
0:03:10.956,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But the real magic and the secret source behind

61
0:03:13.475,000 --> 0:03:15,000
collaborative consumption marketplaces like Airbnb

62
0:03:16.244,000 --> 0:03:18,000
isn't the inventory or the money.

63
0:03:18.879,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It's using the power of technology to build trust

64
0:03:22.396,000 --> 0:03:23,000
between strangers.

65
0:03:23.887,000 --> 0:03:26,000
This side of Airbnb really hit home to Sebastian last summer

66
0:03:27.419,000 --> 0:03:28,000
during the London riots.

67
0:03:28.694,000 --> 0:03:3,000
He woke up around 9, and he checked his email

68
0:03:31.4,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and he saw a bunch of messages all asking him

69
0:03:34.577,000 --> 0:03:35,000
if he was okay.

70
0:03:36.099,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Former guests from around the world had seen that

71
0:03:38.271,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the riots were happening just down the street, and wanted

72
0:03:40.364,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to check if he needed anything.

73
0:03:42.665,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Sebastian actually said to me, he said, "Thirteen former guests

74
0:03:45.85,000 --> 0:03:49,000
contacted me before my own mother rang." (Laughter)

75
0:03:50.013,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Now, this little anecdote gets to the heart of why

76
0:03:54.39,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I'm really passionate about collaborative consumption,

77
0:03:57.294,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and why, after I finished my book, I decided

78
0:03:59.844,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I'm going to try and spread this into a global movement.

79
0:04:03.534,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Because at its core, it's about empowerment.

80
0:04:07.191,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It's about empowering people to make meaningful connections,

81
0:04:11.352,000 --> 0:04:13,000
connections that are enabling us to rediscover

82
0:04:14.274,000 --> 0:04:17,000
a humanness that we've lost somewhere along the way,

83
0:04:17.673,000 --> 0:04:21,000
by engaging in marketplaces like Airbnb, like Kickstarter,

84
0:04:21.993,000 --> 0:04:24,000
like Etsy, that are built on personal relationships

85
0:04:25.226,000 --> 0:04:28,000
versus empty transactions.

86
0:04:28.253,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Now the irony is that these ideas are actually taking us back

87
0:04:31.581,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to old market principles and collaborative behaviors

88
0:04:34.874,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that are hard-wired in all of us.

89
0:04:36.586,000 --> 0:04:38,000
They're just being reinvented in ways that are relevant

90
0:04:39.275,000 --> 0:04:4,000
for the Facebook age.

91
0:04:40.963,000 --> 0:04:43,000
We're literally beginning to realize that we have wired

92
0:04:44.515,000 --> 0:04:48,000
our world to share, swap, rent, barter or trade

93
0:04:48.73,000 --> 0:04:51,000
just about anything. We're sharing our cars on WhipCar,

94
0:04:52.464,000 --> 0:04:55,000
our bikes on Spinlister, our offices on Loosecubes,

95
0:04:55.666,000 --> 0:04:57,000
our gardens on Landshare. We're lending and borrowing

96
0:04:58.465,000 --> 0:05:,000
money from strangers on Zopa and Lending Club.

97
0:05:01.362,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We are trading lessons on everything from sushi-making

98
0:05:03.88,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to coding on Skillshare,

99
0:05:05.466,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and we're even sharing our pets on DogVacay.

100
0:05:09.524,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Now welcome to the wonderful world of collaborative consumption

101
0:05:13.979,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that's enabling us to match wants with haves

102
0:05:17.2,000 --> 0:05:18,000
in more democratic ways.

103
0:05:19.17,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Now, collaborative consumption is creating the start

104
0:05:22.84,000 --> 0:05:25,000
of a transformation in the way we think about supply and demand,

105
0:05:26.164,000 --> 0:05:29,000
but it's also a part of a massive value shift underway,

106
0:05:30.075,000 --> 0:05:33,000
where instead of consuming to keep up with the Joneses,

107
0:05:33.265,000 --> 0:05:36,000
people are consuming to get to know the Joneses.

108
0:05:36.817,000 --> 0:05:4,000
But the key reason why it's taking off now so fast

109
0:05:41.11,000 --> 0:05:44,000
is because every new advancement of technology

110
0:05:44.144,000 --> 0:05:48,000
increases the efficiency and the social glue of trust

111
0:05:48.218,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to make sharing easier and easier.

112
0:05:51.603,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Now, I've looked at thousands of these marketplaces,

113
0:05:54.571,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and trust and efficiency are always the critical ingredients.

114
0:05:59.283,000 --> 0:06:,000
Let me give you an example.

115
0:06:01.275,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Meet 46-year-old Chris Mok, who has, I bet,

116
0:06:05.693,000 --> 0:06:08,000
the best job title here of SuperRabbit.

117
0:06:09.101,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Now, four years ago, Chris lost his job, unfortunately,

118
0:06:13.681,000 --> 0:06:16,000
as an art buyer at Macy's, and like so many people,

119
0:06:17.071,000 --> 0:06:19,000
he struggled to find a new one during the recession.

120
0:06:19.923,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And then he happened to stumble across a post about

121
0:06:23.31,000 --> 0:06:24,000
TaskRabbit.

122
0:06:24.774,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Now, the story behind TaskRabbit starts like so many

123
0:06:28.144,000 --> 0:06:32,000
great stories with a very cute dog by the name of Kobe.

124
0:06:32.231,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Now what happened was, in February 2008,

125
0:06:35.478,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Leah and her husband were waiting for a cab to take them

126
0:06:38.142,000 --> 0:06:41,000
out for dinner, when Kobe came trotting up to them

127
0:06:41.583,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and he was salivating with saliva.

128
0:06:43.943,000 --> 0:06:45,000
They realized they'd run out of dog food.

129
0:06:46.636,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Kevin had to cancel the cab and trudge out in the snow.

130
0:06:49.88,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Now, later that evening, the two self-confessed tech geeks

131
0:06:53.194,000 --> 0:06:56,000
starting talking about how cool it would be if some kind of

132
0:06:56.983,000 --> 0:06:58,000
eBay for errands existed.

133
0:06:59.023,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Six months later, Leah quit her job,

134
0:07:01.678,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and TaskRabbit was born.

135
0:07:04.267,000 --> 0:07:07,000
At the time, she didn't realize that she was actually hitting

136
0:07:08.132,000 --> 0:07:12,000
on a bigger idea she later called service networking.

137
0:07:12.72,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It's essentially about how we use our online relationships

138
0:07:16.253,000 --> 0:07:19,000
to get things done in the real world.

139
0:07:19.57,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Now the way TaskRabbit works is, people outsource

140
0:07:22.179,000 --> 0:07:24,000
the tasks that they want doing, name the price

141
0:07:24.746,000 --> 0:07:26,000
they're willing to pay, and then vetted Rabbits

142
0:07:27.385,000 --> 0:07:28,000
bid to run the errand.

143
0:07:28.918,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Yes, there's actually a four-stage, rigorous interview process

144
0:07:33.411,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that's designed to find the people that would make

145
0:07:35.199,000 --> 0:07:38,000
great personal assistants and weed out the dodgy Rabbits.

146
0:07:38.857,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Now, there's over 4,000 Rabbits across the United States

147
0:07:43.826,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and 5,000 more on the waiting list.

148
0:07:46.843,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Now the tasks being posted are things that you might

149
0:07:49.61,000 --> 0:07:52,000
expect, like help with household chores

150
0:07:52.971,000 --> 0:07:54,000
or doing some supermarket runs.

151
0:07:55.152,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I actually learned the other day that 12 and a half thousand

152
0:07:57.994,000 --> 0:08:,000
loads of laundry have been cleaned and folded

153
0:08:01.017,000 --> 0:08:02,000
through TaskRabbit.

154
0:08:02.729,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But I love that the number one task posted,

155
0:08:06.541,000 --> 0:08:09,000
over a hundred times a day, is something that many of us

156
0:08:09.818,000 --> 0:08:11,000
have felt the pain of doing:

157
0:08:12.386,000 --> 0:08:18,000
yes, assembling Ikea furniture. (Laughter) (Applause)

158
0:08:18.846,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It's brilliant. Now, we may laugh, but Chris here

159
0:08:22.563,000 --> 0:08:24,000
is actually making up to 5,000 dollars a month

160
0:08:25.163,000 --> 0:08:28,000
running errands around his life.

161
0:08:28.314,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And 70 percent of this new labor force

162
0:08:31.649,000 --> 0:08:34,000
were previously unemployed or underemployed.

163
0:08:35.113,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I think TaskRabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption

164
0:08:38.507,000 --> 0:08:41,000
are like lemonade stands on steroids. They're just brilliant.

165
0:08:41.946,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Now, when you think about it, it's amazing, right,

166
0:08:45.971,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that over the past 20 years, we've evolved

167
0:08:49.17,000 --> 0:08:52,000
from trusting people online to share information

168
0:08:52.682,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to trusting to handing over our credit card information,

169
0:08:55.545,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and now we're entering the third trust wave:

170
0:08:58.843,000 --> 0:09:01,000
connecting trustworthy strangers to create all kinds

171
0:09:02.571,000 --> 0:09:04,000
of people-powered marketplaces.

172
0:09:05.098,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I actually came across this fascinating study

173
0:09:06.813,000 --> 0:09:08,000
by the Pew Center this week that revealed

174
0:09:09.253,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that an active Facebook user is three times as likely

175
0:09:12.785,000 --> 0:09:17,000
as a non-Internet user to believe that most people are trustworthy.

176
0:09:17.82,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Virtual trust will transform the way we trust one another

177
0:09:22.197,000 --> 0:09:23,000
face to face.

178
0:09:23.602,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Now, with all of my optimism, and I am an optimist,

179
0:09:26.897,000 --> 0:09:29,000
comes a healthy dose of caution, or rather, an urgent need

180
0:09:30.617,000 --> 0:09:34,000
to address some pressing, complex questions.

181
0:09:35.058,000 --> 0:09:37,000
How to ensure our digital identities reflect our

182
0:09:37.644,000 --> 0:09:4,000
real world identities? Do we want them to be the same?

183
0:09:41.107,000 --> 0:09:44,000
How do we mimic the way trust is built face-to-face online?

184
0:09:44.787,000 --> 0:09:45,000
How do we stop people who've behaved badly

185
0:09:46.67,000 --> 0:09:49,000
in one community doing so under a different guise?

186
0:09:50.364,000 --> 0:09:53,000
In a similar way that companies often use some kind of

187
0:09:53.459,000 --> 0:09:56,000
credit rating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan,

188
0:09:56.922,000 --> 0:09:59,000
or the rate of a mortgage, marketplaces that depend

189
0:09:59.97,000 --> 0:10:01,000
on transactions between relative strangers

190
0:10:02.715,000 --> 0:10:04,000
need some kind of device to let you know that Sebastian

191
0:10:05.659,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and Chris are good eggs,

192
0:10:07.62,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and that device is reputation.

193
0:10:10.74,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Reputation is the measurement of how much a community trusts you.

194
0:10:15.738,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Let's just take a look at Chris.

195
0:10:17.373,000 --> 0:10:2,000
You can see that over 200 people have given him

196
0:10:20.666,000 --> 0:10:23,000
an average rating over 4.99 out of 5.

197
0:10:23.905,000 --> 0:10:25,000
There are over 20 pages of reviews of his work

198
0:10:26.185,000 --> 0:10:28,000
describing him as super-friendly and fast,

199
0:10:28.569,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and he's reached level 25, the highest level,

200
0:10:32.291,000 --> 0:10:33,000
making him a SuperRabbit.

201
0:10:34.248,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Now — (Laughter) -- I love that word, SuperRabbit.

202
0:10:37.146,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And interestingly, what Chris has noted is that as his reputation

203
0:10:40.805,000 --> 0:10:43,000
has gone up, so has his chances of winning a bid

204
0:10:43.964,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and how much he can charge.

205
0:10:45.917,000 --> 0:10:47,000
In other words, for SuperRabbits, reputation

206
0:10:48.655,000 --> 0:10:5,000
has a real world value.

207
0:10:50.724,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Now, I know what you might be thinking.

208
0:10:52.76,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Well, this isn't anything new. Just think of power sellers

209
0:10:55.303,000 --> 0:10:58,000
on eBay or star ratings on Amazon.

210
0:10:58.859,000 --> 0:11:01,000
The difference today is that, with every trade we make,

211
0:11:02.099,000 --> 0:11:05,000
comment we leave, person we flag, badge we earn,

212
0:11:05.499,000 --> 0:11:06,000
we leave a reputation trail

213
0:11:07.441,000 --> 0:11:1,000
of how well we can and can't be trusted.

214
0:11:10.987,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And it's not just the breadth but the volume

215
0:11:13.572,000 --> 0:11:15,000
of reputation data out there that is staggering.

216
0:11:16.21,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Just consider this: Five million nights have been booked

217
0:11:19.514,000 --> 0:11:21,000
on Airbnb in the past six months alone.

218
0:11:22.473,000 --> 0:11:25,000
30 million rides have been shared on Carpooling.com.

219
0:11:26.436,000 --> 0:11:28,000
This year, two billion dollars worth of loans

220
0:11:29.323,000 --> 0:11:31,000
will go through peer-to-peer lending platforms.

221
0:11:31.551,000 --> 0:11:35,000
This adds up to millions of pieces of reputation data

222
0:11:35.905,000 --> 0:11:38,000
on how well we behave or misbehave.

223
0:11:39.277,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Now, capturing and correlating the trails of information

224
0:11:42.866,000 --> 0:11:45,000
that we leave in different places is a massive challenge,

225
0:11:46.119,000 --> 0:11:48,000
but one we're being asked to figure out.

226
0:11:48.721,000 --> 0:11:51,000
What the likes of Sebastian are starting to rightfully ask

227
0:11:52.005,000 --> 0:11:54,000
is, shouldn't they own their reputation data?

228
0:11:54.97,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Shouldn't the reputation that he's personally invested

229
0:11:57.844,000 --> 0:12:,000
on building on Airbnb mean that it should travel with him

230
0:12:01.251,000 --> 0:12:03,000
from one community to another?

231
0:12:03.317,000 --> 0:12:05,000
What I mean by this is, say he started selling second-hand

232
0:12:06.029,000 --> 0:12:09,000
books on Amazon. Why should he have to start from scratch?

233
0:12:09.785,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It's a bit like when I moved from New York to Sydney.

234
0:12:13.46,000 --> 0:12:16,000
It was ridiculous. I couldn't get a mobile phone plan

235
0:12:16.648,000 --> 0:12:19,000
because my credit history didn't travel with me.

236
0:12:20.451,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I was essentially a ghost in the system.

237
0:12:23.395,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Now I'm not suggesting that the next stage

238
0:12:26.41,000 --> 0:12:27,000
of the reputation economy is about

239
0:12:28.306,000 --> 0:12:32,000
adding up multiple ratings into some kind of empty score.

240
0:12:32.675,000 --> 0:12:35,000
People's lives are too complex, and who wants to do that?

241
0:12:36.137,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I also want to be clear that this isn't about adding up

242
0:12:38.584,000 --> 0:12:41,000
tweets and likes and friends in a Klout-like fashion.

243
0:12:42.185,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Those guys are measuring influence, not behaviors

244
0:12:45.465,000 --> 0:12:46,000
that indicate our trustworthiness.

245
0:12:47.352,000 --> 0:12:5,000
But the most important thing that we have to keep in mind

246
0:12:50.952,000 --> 0:12:53,000
is that reputation is largely contextual.

247
0:12:54.893,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Just because Sebastian is a wonderful host

248
0:12:57.627,000 --> 0:13:,000
does not mean that he can assemble Ikea furniture.

249
0:13:01.576,000 --> 0:13:04,000
The big challenge is figuring out what data

250
0:13:04.909,000 --> 0:13:06,000
makes sense to pull, because the future's

251
0:13:07.674,000 --> 0:13:1,000
going to be driven by a smart aggregation of reputation,

252
0:13:11.062,000 --> 0:13:13,000
not a single algorithm.

253
0:13:13.874,000 --> 0:13:16,000
It's only a matter of time before we'll be able to perform

254
0:13:17.625,000 --> 0:13:19,000
a Facebook- or Google-like search

255
0:13:20.024,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and see a complete picture of someone's behaviors

256
0:13:22.946,000 --> 0:13:24,000
in different contexts over time.

257
0:13:25.826,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I envision a realtime stream of who has trusted you,

258
0:13:29.461,000 --> 0:13:33,000
when, where and why, your reliability on TaskRabbit,

259
0:13:33.616,000 --> 0:13:34,000
your cleanliness as a guest on Airbnb,

260
0:13:35.596,000 --> 0:13:38,000
the knowledge that you display on Quora or Tripovo,

261
0:13:39.044,000 --> 0:13:41,000
they'll all live together in one place,

262
0:13:41.627,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and this will live in some kind of reputation dashboard

263
0:13:45.098,000 --> 0:13:49,000
that will paint a picture of your reputation capital.

264
0:13:49.655,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Now this is a concept that I'm currently researching

265
0:13:52.487,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and writing my next book on, and currently define

266
0:13:55.069,000 --> 0:13:58,000
as the worth of your reputation, your intentions,

267
0:13:58.844,000 --> 0:14:02,000
capabilities and values across communities and marketplaces.

268
0:14:03.225,000 --> 0:14:05,000
This isn't some far-off frontier.

269
0:14:06.133,000 --> 0:14:09,000
There are actually a wave of startups like Connect.Me

270
0:14:09.167,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and Legit and TrustCloud that are figuring out how

271
0:14:12.67,000 --> 0:14:16,000
you can aggregate, monitor and use your online reputation.

272
0:14:17.653,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Now, I realize that this concept may sound a little

273
0:14:21.366,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Big Brother to some of you, and yes, there are some

274
0:14:24.932,000 --> 0:14:27,000
enormous transparency and privacy issues to solve,

275
0:14:28.332,000 --> 0:14:31,000
but ultimately, if we can collect our personal reputation,

276
0:14:32.204,000 --> 0:14:34,000
we can actually control it more, and extract

277
0:14:35.117,000 --> 0:14:37,000
the immense value that will flow from it.

278
0:14:37.837,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Also, more so than our credit history,

279
0:14:40.568,000 --> 0:14:42,000
we can actually shape our reputation.

280
0:14:43.204,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Just think of Sebastian

281
0:14:44.523,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and how he bought the cat to influence his.

282
0:14:47.37,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Now privacy issues aside, the other really interesting issue

283
0:14:51.884,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I'm looking at is how do we empower digital ghosts,

284
0:14:54.638,000 --> 0:14:57,000
people [who] for whatever reason, are not active online,

285
0:14:58.034,000 --> 0:15:,000
but are some of the most trustworthy people in the world?

286
0:15:00.798,000 --> 0:15:03,000
How do we take their contributions to their jobs,

287
0:15:04.214,000 --> 0:15:06,000
their communities and their families,

288
0:15:06.218,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and convert that value into reputation capital?

289
0:15:10.126,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Ultimately, when we get it right, reputation capital

290
0:15:13.91,000 --> 0:15:15,000
could create a massive positive disruption

291
0:15:16.748,000 --> 0:15:19,000
in who has power, trust and influence.

292
0:15:20.493,000 --> 0:15:23,000
A three-digit score, your traditional credit history,

293
0:15:24.133,000 --> 0:15:26,000
that only 30 percent of us actually know what it is,

294
0:15:26.83,000 --> 0:15:28,000
will no longer be the determining factor

295
0:15:29.774,000 --> 0:15:32,000
in how much things cost, what we can access,

296
0:15:33.142,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and, in many instances, limit what we can do in the world.

297
0:15:36.062,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Indeed, reputation is a currency that I believe will become

298
0:15:40.47,000 --> 0:15:45,000
more powerful than our credit history in the 21st century.

299
0:15:45.717,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Reputation will be the currency that says

300
0:15:48.414,000 --> 0:15:5,000
that you can trust me.

301
0:15:50.598,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Now the interesting thing is, reputation

302
0:15:53.902,000 --> 0:15:55,000
is the socioeconomic lubricant

303
0:15:55.913,000 --> 0:15:59,000
that makes collaborative consumption work and scale,

304
0:16:00.711,000 --> 0:16:01,000
but the sources it will be generated from,

305
0:16:02.521,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and its applications, are far bigger than this space alone.

306
0:16:07.006,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Let me give you one example from the world of recruiting,

307
0:16:09.945,000 --> 0:16:13,000
where reputation data will make the résumé seem

308
0:16:13.999,000 --> 0:16:17,000
like an archaic relic of the past.

309
0:16:18.077,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Four years ago, tech bloggers and entrepreneurs

310
0:16:22.1,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood, decided to start something

311
0:16:27.198,000 --> 0:16:29,000
called Stack Overflow.

312
0:16:29.742,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Now, Stack Overflow is basically a platform where

313
0:16:33.166,000 --> 0:16:35,000
experienced programmers can ask

314
0:16:35.684,000 --> 0:16:39,000
other good programmers highly detailed technical questions

315
0:16:40.197,000 --> 0:16:43,000
on things like tiny pixels and chrome extensions.

316
0:16:44.189,000 --> 0:16:47,000
This site receives five and a half thousand questions a day,

317
0:16:48.085,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and 80 percent of these receive accurate answers.

318
0:16:51.684,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Now users earn reputation in a whole range of ways,

319
0:16:54.734,000 --> 0:16:56,000
but it's basically by convincing their peers

320
0:16:57.367,000 --> 0:16:59,000
they know what they're talking about.

321
0:16:59.741,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Now a few months after this site launched, the founders

322
0:17:02.518,000 --> 0:17:04,000
heard about something interesting,

323
0:17:04.94,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and it actually didn't surprise them.

324
0:17:06.623,000 --> 0:17:09,000
What they heard was that users were putting

325
0:17:10.211,000 --> 0:17:13,000
their reputation scores on the top of their résumés,

326
0:17:13.655,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and that recruiters were searching the platform

327
0:17:16.464,000 --> 0:17:18,000
to find people with unique talents.

328
0:17:18.71,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Now thousands of programmers today are finding

329
0:17:21.617,000 --> 0:17:24,000
better jobs this way, because Stack Overflow

330
0:17:25.004,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and the reputation dashboards provide a priceless window

331
0:17:28.225,000 --> 0:17:3,000
into how someone really behaves,

332
0:17:30.92,000 --> 0:17:32,000
and what their peers think of them.

333
0:17:33.24,000 --> 0:17:35,000
But the bigger principle of what's happening behind Stack Overflow,

334
0:17:35.744,000 --> 0:17:37,000
I think, is incredibly exciting.

335
0:17:38.291,000 --> 0:17:41,000
People are starting to realize that the reputation

336
0:17:41.585,000 --> 0:17:44,000
they generate in one place has value

337
0:17:44.761,000 --> 0:17:46,000
beyond the environments from which it was built.

338
0:17:47.655,000 --> 0:17:49,000
You know, it's very interesting.

339
0:17:49.691,000 --> 0:17:52,000
When you talk to super-users, whether that's SuperRabbits

340
0:17:52.74,000 --> 0:17:56,000
or super-people on Stack Overflow, or Uberhosts,

341
0:17:57.214,000 --> 0:18:,000
they all talk about how having a high reputation

342
0:18:00.261,000 --> 0:18:03,000
unlocks a sense of their own power.

343
0:18:03.576,000 --> 0:18:05,000
On Stack Overflow, it creates a level playing field,

344
0:18:06.502,000 --> 0:18:08,000
enabling the people with the real talent to rise to the top.

345
0:18:09.429,000 --> 0:18:12,000
On Airbnb, the people often become more important

346
0:18:12.581,000 --> 0:18:14,000
than the spaces. On TaskRabbit,

347
0:18:15.174,000 --> 0:18:18,000
it gives people control of their economic activity.

348
0:18:18.367,000 --> 0:18:21,000
Now at the end of my tea with Sebastian, he told me how,

349
0:18:21.7,000 --> 0:18:24,000
on a bad, rainy day, when he hasn't had a customer

350
0:18:25.341,000 --> 0:18:28,000
in his bookstore, he thinks of all the people around

351
0:18:28.567,000 --> 0:18:3,000
the world who've said something wonderful about him,

352
0:18:31.405,000 --> 0:18:33,000
and what that says about him as a person.

353
0:18:34.076,000 --> 0:18:37,000
He's turning 50 this year, and he's convinced

354
0:18:37.524,000 --> 0:18:4,000
that the rich tapestry of reputation he's built on Airbnb

355
0:18:41.132,000 --> 0:18:43,000
will lead him to doing something interesting

356
0:18:43.883,000 --> 0:18:45,000
with the rest of his life.

357
0:18:46.44,000 --> 0:18:49,000
You know, there are only a few windows in history

358
0:18:50.42,000 --> 0:18:53,000
where the opportunity exists to reinvent

359
0:18:53.644,000 --> 0:18:56,000
part of how our socioeconomic system works.

360
0:18:56.979,000 --> 0:18:58,000
We're living through one of those moments.

361
0:18:59.444,000 --> 0:19:02,000
I believe that we are at the start of a collaborative revolution

362
0:19:03.075,000 --> 0:19:06,000
that will be as significant as the Industrial Revolution.

363
0:19:06.855,000 --> 0:19:09,000
In the 20th century, the invention of traditional credit

364
0:19:10.464,000 --> 0:19:13,000
transformed our consumer system, and in many ways

365
0:19:13.708,000 --> 0:19:15,000
controlled who had access to what.

366
0:19:16.493,000 --> 0:19:19,000
In the 21st century, new trust networks,

367
0:19:19.508,000 --> 0:19:22,000
and the reputation capital they generate, will reinvent

368
0:19:22.882,000 --> 0:19:26,000
the way we think about wealth, markets, power

369
0:19:27.148,000 --> 0:19:31,000
and personal identity, in ways we can't yet even imagine.

370
0:19:31.732,000 --> 0:19:33,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

371
0:19:34.699,000 --> 0:19:39,000
(Applause)

0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Hello! My name is Golan Levin.

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm an artist and an engineer,

3
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
which is, increasingly, a more common kind of hybrid.

4
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
But I still fall into this weird crack

5
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
where people don't seem to understand me.

6
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And I was looking around and I found this wonderful picture.

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It's a letter from "Artforum" in 1967

8
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
saying "We can't imagine ever doing a special issue

9
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
on electronics or computers in art." And they still haven't.

10
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And lest you think that you all, as the digerati, are more enlightened,

11
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I went to the Apple iPhone app store the other day.

12
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Where's art? I got productivity. I got sports.

13
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iPhone,

14
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
which my friends and I are doing now,

15
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is still not reflected in our understanding

16
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
of what computers are for.

17
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So, from both directions, there is kind of, I think, a lack of understanding

18
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials

19
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
of his own day, or her own day,

20
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
which I think artists are obliged to do,

21
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have.

22
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
In my own case, I'm an artist,

23
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and I'm really interested in

24
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
expanding the vocabulary of human action,

25
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and basically empowering people through interactivity.

26
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I want people to discover themselves as actors,

27
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
as creative actors, by having interactive experiences.

28
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
A lot of my work is about trying to get away from this.

29
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
This a photograph of the desktop of a student of mine.

30
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And when I say desktop, I don't just mean

31
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
the actual desk where his mouse has worn away the surface of the desk.

32
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
If you look carefully, you can even see

33
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
a hint of the Apple menu, up here in the upper left,

34
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
where the virtual world has literally

35
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
punched through to the physical.

36
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So this is, as Joy Mountford once said,

37
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
"The mouse is probably the narrowest straw

38
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
you could try to suck all of human expression through."

39
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And the thing I'm really trying to do is enabling people to have more rich

41
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
kinds of interactive experiences.

42
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
How can we get away from the mouse and use our full bodies

43
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
as a way of exploring aesthetic experiences,

44
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
not necessarily utilitarian ones.

45
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So I write software. And that's how I do it.

46
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And a lot of my experiences

47
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
resemble mirrors in some way.

48
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Because this is, in some sense, the first way,

49
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that people discover their own potential as actors,

50
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and discover their own agency.

51
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
By saying "Who is that person in the mirror? Oh it's actually me."

52
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And so, to give an example,

53
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
this is a project from last year,

54
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
which is called the Interstitial Fragment Processor.

55
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And it allows people to explore the negative shapes that they create

56
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
when they're just going about their everyday business.

57
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So as people make shapes with their hands or their heads

58
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and so forth, or with each other,

59
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
these shapes literally produce sounds and drop out of thin air --

60
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
basically taking what's often this, kind of, unseen space,

61
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
or this undetected space, and making it something real,

62
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that people then can appreciate and become creative with.

63
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So again, people discover their creative agency in this way.

64
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And their own personalities come out

65
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
in totally unique ways.

66
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So in addition to using full-body input,

67
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
something that I've explored now, for a while,

68
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
has been the use of the voice,

69
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
which is an immensely expressive system for us, vocalizing.

70
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Song is one of our oldest ways

71
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
of making ourselves heard and understood.

72
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And I came across this fantastic research by Wolfgang Köhler,

73
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the so-called father of gestalt psychology, from 1927,

74
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
who submitted to an audience like yourselves

75
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
the following two shapes.

76
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And he said one of them is called Maluma.

77
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And one of them is called Taketa. Which is which?

78
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Anyone want to hazard a guess?

79
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Maluma is on top. Yeah. So.

80
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
As he says here, most people answer without any hesitation.

81
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So what we're really seeing here is a phenomenon

82
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
called phonaesthesia,

83
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
which is a kind of synesthesia that all of you have.

84
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And so, whereas Dr. Oliver Sacks has talked about

85
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
how perhaps one person in a million

86
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
actually has true synesthesia,

87
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
where they hear colors or taste shapes, and things like this,

88
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent.

89
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It's about mappings between different perceptual domains,

90
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
like hardness, sharpness, brightness and darkness,

91
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and the phonemes that we're able to speak with.

92
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So 70 years on, there's been some research where

93
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
cognitive psychologists have actually sussed out

94
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the extent to which, you know,

95
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
L, M and B are more associated with shapes that look like this,

96
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and P, T and K are perhaps more associated with shapes like this.

97
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature

98
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that we can exploit numerically,

99
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
a relative mapping between curvature and shape.

100
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So it occurred to me, what happens if we could run these backwards?

101
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And thus was born the project called Remark,

102
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
which is a collaboration with Zachary Lieberman

103
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and the Ars Electronica Futurelab.

104
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And this is an interactive installation which presents

105
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
the fiction that speech casts visible shadows.

106
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light.

107
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And as you do, you see the shadows of your own speech.

108
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And they sort of fly away, out of your head.

109
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
If a computer speech recognition system

110
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is able to recognize what you're saying, then it spells it out.

111
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And if it isn't then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically

112
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
tightly coupled to the sounds you made.

113
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So let's bring up a video of that.

114
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Applause)

115
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Thanks. So. And this project here,

116
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I was working with the great abstract vocalist, Jaap Blonk.

117
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And he is a world expert in performing "The Ursonate,"

118
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
which is a half-an-hour nonsense poem

119
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
by Kurt Schwitters, written in the 1920s,

120
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
which is half an hour of very highly patterned nonsense.

121
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And it's almost impossible to perform.

122
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But Jaap is one of the world experts in performing it.

123
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And in this project we've developed

124
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
a form of intelligent real-time subtitles.

125
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So these are our live subtitles,

126
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that are being produced by a computer that knows the text of "The Ursonate" --

127
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
fortunately Jaap does too, very well --

128
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and it is delivering that text at the same time as Jaap is.

129
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So all the text you're going to see

130
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
is real-time generated by the computer,

131
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
visualizing what he's doing with his voice.

132
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Here you can see the set-up where there is a screen with the subtitles behind him.

133
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Okay. So ...

134
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
(Applause)

135
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The full videos are online if you are interested.

136
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I got a split reaction to that during the live performance,

137
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
because there is some people who understand

138
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
live subtitles are a kind of an oxymoron,

139
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
because usually there is someone making them afterwards.

140
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And then a bunch of people who were like, "What's the big deal?

141
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I see subtitles all the time on television."

142
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
You know? They don't imagine the person in the booth, typing it all.

143
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So in addition to the full body, and in addition to the voice,

144
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
another thing that I've been really interested in,

145
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
most recently, is the use of the eyes,

146
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
or the gaze, in terms of how people relate to each other.

147
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It's a really profound amount of nonverbal information

148
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that's communicated with the eyes.

149
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And it's one of the most interesting technical challenges

150
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that's very currently active in the computer sciences:

151
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
being able to have a camera that can understand,

152
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
from a fairly big distance away,

153
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
how these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another

154
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
to reveal what you're interested in,

155
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and where your attention is directed.

156
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So there is a lot of emotional communication that happens there.

157
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And so I've been beginning, with a variety of different projects,

158
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes.

159
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And basically to ask the questions:

160
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
What if art was aware that we were looking at it?

161
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
How could it respond, in a way,

162
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to acknowledge or subvert the fact that we're looking at it?

163
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And what could it do if it could look back at us?

164
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And so those are the questions that are happening in the next projects.

165
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
In the first one which I'm going to show you, called Eyecode,

166
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
it's a piece of interactive software

167
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
in which, if we read this little circle,

168
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
"the trace left by the looking of the previous observer

169
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer."

170
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
The idea is that it's an image wholly constructed

171
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
from its own history of being viewed

172
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
by different people in an installation.

173
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So let me just switch over so we can do the live demo.

174
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
So let's run this and see if it works.

175
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Okay. Ah, there is lots of nice bright video.

176
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
There is just a little test screen that shows that it's working.

177
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And what I'm just going to do is -- I'm going to hide that.

178
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And you can see here that what it's doing

179
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
is it's recording my eyes every time I blink.

180
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Hello? And I can ... hello ... okay.

181
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And no matter where I am, what's really going on here

182
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
is that it's an eye-tracking system that tries to locate my eyes.

183
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And if I get really far away I'm blurry.

184
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
You know, you're going to have these kind of blurry spots like this

185
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
that maybe only resemble eyes in a very very abstract way.

186
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
But if I come up really close and stare directly at the camera

187
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
on this laptop then you'll see these nice crisp eyes.

188
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
You can think of it as a way of, sort of, typing, with your eyes.

189
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And what you're typing are recordings of your eyes

190
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
as you're looking at other peoples' eyes.

191
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
So each person is looking at the looking

192
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
of everyone else before them.

193
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And this exists in larger installations

194
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
where there are thousands and thousands of eyes

195
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
that people could be staring at,

196
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
as you see who's looking at the people looking

197
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
at the people looking before them.

198
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
So I'll just add a couple more. Blink. Blink.

199
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And you can see, just once again, how it's sort of finding my eyes

200
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and doing its best to estimate when it's blinking.

201
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Alright. Let's leave that.

202
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So that's this kind of recursive observation system.

203
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
(Applause)

204
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Thank you.

205
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
The last couple pieces I'm going to show

206
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
are basically in the new realm of robotics -- for me, new for me.

207
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
It's called Opto-Isolator.

208
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And I'm going to show a video of the older version of it,

209
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
which is just a minute long. Okay.

210
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
In this case, the Opto-Isolator is blinking

211
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
in response to one's own blinks.

212
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
So it blinks one second after you do.

213
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
This is a device which is intended to reduce

214
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
the phenomenon of gaze down to the simplest possible materials.

215
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Just one eye,

216
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
looking at you, and eliminating everything else about a face,

217
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
but just to consider gaze in an isolated way

218
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
as a kind of, as an element.

219
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And at the same time, it attempts to engage in what you might call

220
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
familiar psycho-social gaze behaviors.

221
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Like looking away if you look at it too long

222
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
because it gets shy,

223
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
or things like that.

224
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Okay. So the last project I'm going to show

225
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
is this new one called Snout.

226
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
(Laughter)

227
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
It's an eight-foot snout,

228
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
with a googly eye.

229
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
(Laughter)

230
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And inside it's got an 800-pound robot arm

231
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
that I borrowed,

232
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
(Laughter)

233
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
from a friend.

234
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
(Laughter)

235
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
It helps to have good friends.

236
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I'm at Carnegie Mellon; we've got a great Robotics Institute there.

237
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I'd like to show you thing called Snout, which is --

238
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
The idea behind this project is to

239
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
make a robot that appears as if it's continually surprised to see you.

240
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
(Laughter)

241
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
The idea is that basically --

242
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
if it's constantly like "Huh? ... Huh?"

243
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
That's why its other name is Doubletaker, Taker of Doubles.

244
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
It's always kind of doing a double take: "What?"

245
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And the idea is basically, can it look at you

246
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and make you feel as if like,

247
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
"What? Is it my shoes?"

248
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
"Got something on my hair?" Here we go. Alright.

249
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Checking him out ...

250
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
For you nerds, here's a little behind-the-scenes.

251
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
It's got a computer vision system,

252
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and it tries to look at the people who are moving around the most.

253
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Those are its targets.

254
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Up there is the skeleton,

255
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
which is actually what it's trying to do.

256
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
It's really about trying to create a novel body language for a new creature.

257
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Hollywood does this all the time, of course.

258
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
But also have the body language communicate something

259
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
to the person who is looking at it.

260
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
This language is communicating that it is surprised to see you,

261
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and it's interested in looking at you.

262
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
(Laughter)

263
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
(Applause)

264
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Thank you very much. That's all I've got for today.

265
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And I'm really happy to be here. Thank you so much.

266
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
(Applause)

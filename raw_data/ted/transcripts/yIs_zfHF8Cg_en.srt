9
0:00:20.279,000 --> 0:00:26,000

10
0:00:23.22,000 --> 0:00:29,000
do it you run in screaming so says

11
0:00:26.64,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Margaret Atwood she's best known as the

12
0:00:29.31,000 --> 0:00:33,000
acclaimed author of The Handmaid's Tale

13
0:00:30.9,000 --> 0:00:34,000

14
0:00:33.899,000 --> 0:00:37,000
you might not know that she's also a

15

self-proclaimed world expert on

16
0:00:38.129,000 --> 0:00:43,000
procrastination yeah yeah I racked up

17
0:00:40.92,000 --> 0:00:45,000
you know years and years of it because

18
0:00:43.14,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Margaret doesn't do anything halfway if

19
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
we're gonna do something might as well

20
0:00:47.61,000 --> 0:00:54,000
be good at it right I'd hate to be a

21
0:00:49.89,000 --> 0:00:56,000
failed procrastinator she can

22
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
procrastinate anywhere with the greatest

23
0:00:57.719,000 --> 0:01:03,000
of use at home in a coffee shop even up

24
0:01:01.829,000 --> 0:01:06,000
in the air I think it's always more fun

25
0:01:04.049,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to watch movies on planes than to work a

26
0:01:07.439,000 --> 0:01:12,000
film called Captain Underpants was on

27
0:01:10.5,000 --> 0:01:16,000
the menu so I was watching Captain

28
0:01:13.2,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Underpants which well repaid my time and

29
0:01:17.03,000 --> 0:01:22,000
then the plane landed and I forgot that

30
0:01:19.56,000 --> 0:01:23,000
my computer was on it and did not tell

31
0:01:22.59,000 --> 0:01:25,000
my publishers that I had left this

32
0:01:24.42,000 --> 0:01:28,000
computer with all of this correspondence

33
0:01:26.49,000 --> 0:01:3,000
about the heavily embargoed novel the

34
0:01:28.53,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Testaments on the plane oh my gosh yeah

35
0:01:31.02,000 --> 0:01:37,000
it was very bad I won't do it again soon

36
0:01:33.86,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but here's the thing despite being a

37
0:01:37.17,000 --> 0:01:42,000
world-class procrastinator Margaret does

38
0:01:39.63,000 --> 0:01:45,000
not turn manuscripts in late no no no no

39
0:01:43.11,000 --> 0:01:47,000
no I do not miss deadlines I would

40
0:01:45.659,000 --> 0:01:49,000
consider it dishonorable to miss a

41
0:01:47.7,000 --> 0:01:52,000
deadline how does she manage her

42
0:01:50.28,000 --> 0:01:54,000

unusual people as they've mastered

0:02:15.209,000 --> 0:02:24,000
something I wish everyone knew about

52
0:02:17.01,000 --> 0:02:26,000
work today procrastination and why it's

53
0:02:24.48,000 --> 0:02:28,000
not as much of a character flaw or is

54
0:02:26.79,000 --> 0:02:3,000
impossible to overcome as you might

59
0:02:45.58,000 --> 0:02:48,000
procrastination is intentionally

60
0:02:47.54,000 --> 0:02:5,000
delaying a task that needs to be done

61
0:02:49.01,000 --> 0:02:53,000
even though you know it will come with

62
0:02:50.629,000 --> 0:02:55,000
the cost instead of working you might

63
0:02:53.87,000 --> 0:02:57,000
find yourself watching cat videos on

64
0:02:55.76,000 --> 0:02:58,000
YouTube looking in your fridge to see if

65

something new has magically appeared in

66
0:02:59.69,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the last 10 minutes or deciding your

67
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
productivity problem is that you type

68
0:03:03.98,000 --> 0:03:06,000
too slow

69
0:03:04.64,000 --> 0:03:09,000
then taking a typing test online to

70
0:03:06.98,000 --> 0:03:1,000
confirm your suspicions and then taking

71
0:03:09.709,000 --> 0:03:14,000
it over and over to get a better score

72
0:03:11.39,000 --> 0:03:16,000
if you're like most people you first

73
0:03:14.81,000 --> 0:03:18,000
became acquainted with procrastination

74
0:03:16.519,000 --> 0:03:2,000
in school somewhere between 80 and 95

75
0:03:19.43,000 --> 0:03:24,000
percent of students procrastinate and

76
0:03:21.41,000 --> 0:03:26,000
half of them do it chronically but it

77
0:03:24.92,000 --> 0:03:28,000
doesn't just disappear when you graduate

78
0:03:26.93,000 --> 0:03:31,000
about 15 to 20 percent of adults or

79
0:03:29.66,000 --> 0:03:34,000
chronic procrastinators I'm not one of

80
0:03:32.81,000 --> 0:03:36,000
them I'm the opposite a procrastinator

81
0:03:35.349,000 --> 0:03:38,000
someone who feels pressure to start

82
0:03:37.4,000 --> 0:03:41,000
tests immediately and finish them ahead

83
0:03:39.17,000 --> 0:03:46,000
of schedule although I did get sucked

84
0:03:42.319,000 --> 0:03:47,000
into that typing test but if a task is

85
0:03:46.489,000 --> 0:03:49,000
important I tend to get it done before

86
0:03:48.2,000 --> 0:03:52,000
the deadline and my colleagues tell me

87
0:03:50.209,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that can be annoying I'm constantly late

88
0:03:52.459,000 --> 0:03:55,000
to meetings my Excuse

89
0:03:54.5,000 --> 0:04:,000
I was busy finishing another project

90
0:03:56.42,000 --> 0:04:02,000
early so I'm pretty fascinated by

91
0:04:01.099,000 --> 0:04:06,000
chronic procrastinators who live on the

92
0:04:03.349,000 --> 0:04:07,000
opposite extreme like Douglas Adams who

93
0:04:06.65,000 --> 0:04:1,000
wrote The Hitchhiker's Guide to the

94
0:04:07.819,000 --> 0:04:12,000
galaxy on a typical writing day he would

95
0:04:11.389,000 --> 0:04:16,000
sit in the bath for hours waiting for an

96
0:04:13.639,000 --> 0:04:18,000
idea to come by the time he got out and

97
0:04:16.609,000 --> 0:04:2,000
got dressed he often forgot the idea

98
0:04:18.95,000 --> 0:04:23,000
which would lead him right back to the

99
0:04:21.56,000 --> 0:04:26,000
bathtub it was so bad that he once had

100
0:04:24.77,000 --> 0:04:29,000
his editor lock him in a hotel suite for

101
0:04:27.169,000 --> 0:04:34,000
several weeks one that presumably only

102
0:04:30.32,000 --> 0:04:37,000
had a shower writers are legendary

103
0:04:34.55,000 --> 0:04:4,000
procrastinators the question is why and

104
0:04:37.72,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Margaret Atwood has an answer unseen

105
0:04:41.24,000 --> 0:04:45,000
myself as lazy if you're a

106
0:04:43.7,000 --> 0:04:48,000
procrastinator you might have said the

107
0:04:45.65,000 --> 0:04:49,000
same thing about yourself lazy slacker

108
0:04:48.969,000 --> 0:04:52,000
undisciplined

109
0:04:50.509,000 --> 0:04:55,000
but is margaret atwood best-selling

110
0:04:53.449,000 --> 0:04:58,000
author of dozens of books really lazy

111
0:04:56.09,000 --> 0:05:,000
yeah no that's that's one of the common

112
0:04:59.389,000 --> 0:05:02,000
myths about procrastination is just

113
0:05:00.86,000 --> 0:05:04,000
people being lazy

114
0:05:02.539,000 --> 0:05:06,000
fuchsias ur-wah is a psychologist in the

115
0:05:05.24,000 --> 0:05:09,000
UK her specialty is studying

116
0:05:07.52,000 --> 0:05:12,000
procrastination and she knows that the

117
0:05:09.979,000 --> 0:05:13,000
root of procrastination is actually

118
0:05:12.53,000 --> 0:05:17,000
something far sneakier than laziness

119
0:05:14.63,000 --> 0:05:19,000
it's not about avoiding work it's about

120
0:05:18.139,000 --> 0:05:23,000
avoiding feelings

121
0:05:19.849,000 --> 0:05:24,000
more specifically negative emotions we

122
0:05:23.15,000 --> 0:05:27,000
say at the core the cross nation is

123
0:05:25.34,000 --> 0:05:31,000
about mood regulation so a task may

124
0:05:27.919,000 --> 0:05:34,000
elicit lack of confidence feelings of

125
0:05:31.389,000 --> 0:05:38,000
incompetency insecurity fear of failure

126
0:05:35.289,000 --> 0:05:4,000
anxiety you put that task aside and

127
0:05:38.99,000 --> 0:05:41,000
you've just regulated your mood now you

128
0:05:40.58,000 --> 0:05:43,000
feel better it's like oh great I don't

129
0:05:42.259,000 --> 0:05:45,000
have to think about anymore you know

130
0:05:43.729,000 --> 0:05:47,000
more about this than most people do you

131
0:05:45.74,000 --> 0:05:49,000
do still procrastinate yeah well you

132
0:05:48.319,000 --> 0:05:52,000
know I'm human so yeah I do i do

133
0:05:50.449,000 --> 0:05:54,000
procrastinate the classic thing for me

134
0:05:52.46,000 --> 0:05:57,000
is you know I've got this paper to write

135
0:05:54.919,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and I just I'm thinking that it's this

136
0:05:57.86,000 --> 0:06:01,000
is gonna be really hard and I keep I

137
0:06:00.56,000 --> 0:06:04,000
build it up into something that's really

138
0:06:02.15,000 --> 0:06:06,000
huge and you know after a couple of days

139
0:06:04.759,000 --> 0:06:07,000
of that I just kind of got right I'm

140
0:06:06.199,000 --> 0:06:08,000
procrastinating I've just got to get on

141
0:06:07.969,000 --> 0:06:1,000
with this

142
0:06:08.659,000 --> 0:06:12,000
everyone procrastinates on something if

143
0:06:11.9,000 --> 0:06:14,000
you're on top of your work there's

144
0:06:13.46,000 --> 0:06:17,000
probably still a task you're delaying

145
0:06:15.349,000 --> 0:06:2,000
even though you know it comes at a cost

146
0:06:17.77,000 --> 0:06:22,000
you've got to buy a present for your

147
0:06:21.05,000 --> 0:06:25,000
aunt did she only see once a year for

148
0:06:22.909,000 --> 0:06:26,000
example and she tends to be really picky

149
0:06:25.219,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and so now you're thinking huh if I make

150
0:06:27.38,000 --> 0:06:3,000
a mistake she's just gonna give me that

151
0:06:29.12,000 --> 0:06:35,000
look it's good this doesn't sound like a

152
0:06:31.37,000 --> 0:06:39,000
hypothetical example I'm not gonna ask

153
0:06:35.24,000 --> 0:06:42,000
you to name your aunt but if you still

154
0:06:40.19,000 --> 0:06:44,000
think you're just lazy here's some proof

155
0:06:42.469,000 --> 0:06:46,000
take a look at what you do while you're

156
0:06:44.96,000 --> 0:06:48,000
procrastinating some of those tasks

157
0:06:47.24,000 --> 0:06:52,000
actually take a lot of energy and effort

158
0:06:49.419,000 --> 0:06:54,000
you'll see some you know classic chronic

159
0:06:52.969,000 --> 0:06:55,000
procrastinators they will have the

160
0:06:54.469,000 --> 0:06:57,000
neatest houses everything will be

161
0:06:56.12,000 --> 0:06:59,000
organized all the dishes will be done

162
0:06:57.889,000 --> 0:07:,000
everything will be clean but the big

163
0:06:59.96,000 --> 0:07:01,000
looming tasks that they're supposed to

164
0:07:01.31,000 --> 0:07:04,000
be doing is

165
0:07:02.37,000 --> 0:07:05,000
being done if you're actively doing

166
0:07:04.5,000 --> 0:07:08,000
something else it's pretty clear that

167
0:07:06.36,000 --> 0:07:11,000
you're not lazy you're avoiding a task

168
0:07:08.91,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that stirs up negative emotions and that

169
0:07:11.61,000 --> 0:07:15,000
can have consequences at work chronic

170
0:07:14.43,000 --> 0:07:18,000
procrastinators are less productive than

171
0:07:16.08,000 --> 0:07:2,000
their peers and their health suffers for

172
0:07:18.75,000 --> 0:07:22,000
it if you're a chronic procrastinator

173
0:07:20.4,000 --> 0:07:27,000
you have higher levels of stress you

174
0:07:23.49,000 --> 0:07:29,000
have poor sleep quality you tend to not

175
0:07:27.57,000 --> 0:07:31,000
exercise as much you might eat more junk

176
0:07:30.27,000 --> 0:07:32,000
food especially because you're stressed

177
0:07:31.979,000 --> 0:07:33,000
right

178
0:07:32.4,000 --> 0:07:36,000
if your credit krasner you've got

179
0:07:34.08,000 --> 0:07:38,000
difficulty regulating yourself which can

180
0:07:36.63,000 --> 0:07:39,000
lead to depression and anxiety

181
0:07:38.4,000 --> 0:07:41,000
they actually part off seeking help for

182
0:07:40.53,000 --> 0:07:44,000
those mental health issues which doesn't

183
0:07:41.94,000 --> 0:07:47,000
help either Oh No so they met a

184
0:07:44.55,000 --> 0:07:51,000
procrastinate yes definitely people feel

185
0:07:48.449,000 --> 0:07:53,000
guilty when they procrastinate but that

186
0:07:51.69,000 --> 0:07:54,000
guilt doesn't operate in the same way

187
0:07:53.789,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that it does for most people guilt can

188
0:07:55.65,000 --> 0:07:59,000
be a motivating emotion right yeah it's

189
0:07:57.63,000 --> 0:08:,000
like the uma Bombeck line that guilts is

190
0:08:00.15,000 --> 0:08:04,000
the gift that keeps on giving

191
0:08:01.59,000 --> 0:08:07,000
yeah well for procrastinators what it

192
0:08:04.38,000 --> 0:08:09,000
gives is more procrastination so unfair

193
0:08:08.31,000 --> 0:08:11,000
right even if you're not a chronic

194
0:08:10.289,000 --> 0:08:13,000
procrastinator there are certain types

195
0:08:12.21,000 --> 0:08:16,000
of tasks that you might have a habit of

196
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
postponing might be a procrastination ik

197
0:08:16.86,000 --> 0:08:24,000
environment because did you say

198
0:08:19.47,000 --> 0:08:26,000
procrastinate genic yes it's an

199
0:08:25.53,000 --> 0:08:29,000
environment that it can evoke

200
0:08:27.18,000 --> 0:08:31,000
procrastination I am absolutely using

201
0:08:29.58,000 --> 0:08:33,000
this as an excuse it's not me it's not

202
0:08:31.77,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that I lack willpower this is just a

203
0:08:33.75,000 --> 0:08:39,000
very procrastinate genic task yeah tasks

204
0:08:36.779,000 --> 0:08:42,000
that don't give you autonomy that lack

205
0:08:39.81,000 --> 0:08:43,000
structure and that are ambiguous is that

206
0:08:42.99,000 --> 0:08:46,000
why so many writers struggle with

207
0:08:44.55,000 --> 0:08:48,000
procrastination I could be because yeah

208
0:08:47.49,000 --> 0:08:49,000
when you're writing who's telling you

209
0:08:49.05,000 --> 0:08:52,000
what the next thing is you're supposed

210
0:08:50.459,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to be writing right you are I mean it

211
0:08:52.62,000 --> 0:08:56,000
brings up uncertainty about yourself it

212
0:08:54.57,000 --> 0:08:58,000
brings up doubts about whether you know

213
0:08:57.48,000 --> 0:09:03,000
what you're doing right we all have that

214
0:08:58.92,000 --> 0:09:04,000
feeling from time to time you might find

215
0:09:03.48,000 --> 0:09:08,000
yourself procrastinating to avoid

216
0:09:05.04,000 --> 0:09:09,000
anxiety confusion or boredom whichever

217
0:09:08.7,000 --> 0:09:11,000
your flavor of procrastination

218
0:09:09.95,000 --> 0:09:13,000
psychology points to a couple ways to

219
0:09:11.82,000 --> 0:09:15,000
curb it for one you can start by trying

220
0:09:14.339,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to be a little kinder to yourself

221
0:09:16.14,000 --> 0:09:21,000
about your past procrastination yep this

222
0:09:18.6,000 --> 0:09:22,000
actually makes a difference our emotions

223
0:09:21.15,000 --> 0:09:26,000
can actually change the way we view the

224
0:09:22.98,000 --> 0:09:27,000
task instead of beating yourself up show

225
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
yourself a little compassion relieve the

226
0:09:28.29,000 --> 0:09:32,000
guilt research reveals that after

227
0:09:30.51,000 --> 0:09:33,000
students put off studying for an exam

228
0:09:32.4,000 --> 0:09:35,000
those who forgive themselves are

229
0:09:33.93,000 --> 0:09:36,000
actually less likely to procrastinate on

230
0:09:35.7,000 --> 0:09:38,000
preparing for the next test

231
0:09:37.22,000 --> 0:09:4,000
fuschia our colleagues have found that

232
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
it helps to remind yourself that you're

233
0:09:40.83,000 --> 0:09:43,000
not the only one suffering from

234
0:09:42.21,000 --> 0:09:46,000
procrastination it's part of the human

235
0:09:44.25,000 --> 0:09:48,000
condition everyone does it on occasion

236
0:09:46.35,000 --> 0:09:5,000
sometimes I will just sort of step back

237
0:09:48.36,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and go yep yep I'm just being like every

238
0:09:50.85,000 --> 0:09:54,000
other procrastinator in the flat there

239
0:09:52.8,000 --> 0:09:56,000
right now and you're acknowledging what

240
0:09:55.11,000 --> 0:10:,000
you're doing accepting responsibility

241
0:09:57.03,000 --> 0:10:02,000
for but you're not feeding back into the

242
0:10:00.15,000 --> 0:10:03,000
negative emotions that probably put you

243
0:10:02.22,000 --> 0:10:05,000
in that place where you wanted to

244
0:10:03.51,000 --> 0:10:06,000
procrastinate in the first place it

245
0:10:05.4,000 --> 0:10:08,000
turns out that self compassion is

246
0:10:06.93,000 --> 0:10:1,000
especially hard if you're a neurotic

247
0:10:08.7,000 --> 0:10:12,000
perfectionist the kind of person who

248
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
constantly beats yourself up for never

249
0:10:13.17,000 --> 0:10:18,000
doing work that's good enough if that's

250
0:10:16.53,000 --> 0:10:21,000
you you might take a cue from productive

251
0:10:18.84,000 --> 0:10:23,000
perfectionist and stop judging your work

252
0:10:21.57,000 --> 0:10:25,000
before you've even produced it in other

253
0:10:24.42,000 --> 0:10:28,000
words don't criticize yourself while

254
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
you're creating try waiting until you've

255
0:10:28.77,000 --> 0:10:32,000
finished of helping your ideas before

256
0:10:30.81,000 --> 0:10:35,000
you worry about evaluating them that's

257
0:10:33.54,000 --> 0:10:37,000
something Margaret Atwood advises the

258
0:10:35.94,000 --> 0:10:42,000
waste paper basket is your friend

259
0:10:38.48,000 --> 0:10:45,000
so go ahead say something it may be the

260
0:10:43.29,000 --> 0:10:47,000
wrong thing but you can throw that out

261
0:10:45.6,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and no one will ever read your dumb

262
0:10:48.12,000 --> 0:10:52,000
thing that you've put on them Margaret

263
0:10:50.55,000 --> 0:10:54,000
has a long history of procrastinating to

264
0:10:52.74,000 --> 0:10:56,000
escape negative emotions I

265
0:10:54.68,000 --> 0:10:58,000
procrastinated about starting the

266
0:10:56.85,000 --> 0:11:,000
Handmaid's Tale I procrastinator for

267
0:10:58.8,000 --> 0:11:05,000
about three years I tried to write him a

268
0:11:01.83,000 --> 0:11:07,000
more normal novel instead because I

269
0:11:06.09,000 --> 0:11:1,000
thought it was just too bad he too bad

270
0:11:08.58,000 --> 0:11:12,000
he really yeah I mean it doesn't seem

271
0:11:10.83,000 --> 0:11:14,000
very badiy now but but think of when

272
0:11:12.69,000 --> 0:11:17,000
this was it was in the early 80s yeah it

273
0:11:15.45,000 --> 0:11:19,000
just seemed a bit too bad II Margaret

274
0:11:18.24,000 --> 0:11:22,000
wasn't just worried that the plot was

275
0:11:19.98,000 --> 0:11:24,000
far-fetched her fears actually kept her

276
0:11:22.8,000 --> 0:11:26,000
from writing the book sooner you don't

277
0:11:25.29,000 --> 0:11:28,000
know who's gonna read it you've got no

278
0:11:26.85,000 --> 0:11:29,000
idea you don't know whether they'll like

279
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
it or not

280
0:11:29.92,000 --> 0:11:34,000
it's not something you can anticipate or

281
0:11:32.23,000 --> 0:11:36,000
have any control over really years ago

282
0:11:35.47,000 --> 0:11:38,000
when asked to describe her writing

283
0:11:36.97,000 --> 0:11:4,000
routine Margaret said she would spend

284
0:11:39.13,000 --> 0:11:43,000
the morning procrastinating and worrying

285
0:11:41.019,000 --> 0:11:44,000
then plunge into the manuscript in a

286
0:11:43.329,000 --> 0:11:46,000
frenzy of anxiety around three o'clock

287
0:11:45.01,000 --> 0:11:5,000
when it looked as though she might not

288
0:11:47.32,000 --> 0:11:52,000
get anything done it still happens to

289
0:11:50.44,000 --> 0:11:54,000
her sometimes scrolling around on the

290
0:11:52.779,000 --> 0:11:56,000
news certainly can get me sucked in

291
0:11:54.91,000 --> 0:11:58,000
luckily Margaret has come up with a

292
0:11:57.01,000 --> 0:12:01,000
unique strategy for dealing with her

293
0:11:59.079,000 --> 0:12:03,000
procrastination habit and it's a trick

294
0:12:01.51,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that lines up with what some researchers

295
0:12:03.37,000 --> 0:12:08,000
recommend I had a another name that I

296
0:12:05.829,000 --> 0:12:1,000
grew up with and that gave me to name so

297
0:12:08.769,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I handed double identity so Margaret

298
0:12:11.29,000 --> 0:12:16,000
does the writing and the other one does

299
0:12:13.93,000 --> 0:12:19,000
everything else her alter egos name is

300
0:12:16.87,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Peggy it's a Scottish diminutive of

301
0:12:20.17,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Margaret do you actually refer to

302
0:12:22.779,000 --> 0:12:28,000
yourself by both identities in your head

303
0:12:24.88,000 --> 0:12:3,000
absolutely seriously well you say what

304
0:12:29.139,000 --> 0:12:33,000
arrangement gives me do you have

305
0:12:31.389,000 --> 0:12:37,000
conversations between Margaret and Peggy

306
0:12:33.699,000 --> 0:12:4,000
no they lead quite separate lives Peggy

307
0:12:37.449,000 --> 0:12:42,000
does the laundry now there is of course

308
0:12:40.839,000 --> 0:12:43,000
some overlap because sometimes when

309
0:12:42.88,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Peggy's doing a laundry Margaret is

310
0:12:44.68,000 --> 0:12:48,000
thinking about what is being written

311
0:12:46.74,000 --> 0:12:52,000
deciding what to write is done by

312
0:12:49.29,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Margaret deciding when to write is

313
0:12:52.839,000 --> 0:12:58,000
sometimes a tug-of-war Margaret's dual

314
0:12:56.769,000 --> 0:12:59,000
identity strategy isn't as strange as it

315
0:12:59.38,000 --> 0:13:01,000
sounds

316
0:13:00.24,000 --> 0:13:04,000
psychologists have long observed that we

317
0:13:02.14,000 --> 0:13:07,000
have two selves the want self and the

318
0:13:04.63,000 --> 0:13:09,000
should self your want self runs on

319
0:13:07.69,000 --> 0:13:11,000
emotions it's drawn to whatever avoids

320
0:13:09.97,000 --> 0:13:13,000
pain or brings pleasure in the short run

321
0:13:11.949,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that's Margaret watching Captain

322
0:13:14.62,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Underpants oh you'd rather me watch

323
0:13:16.42,000 --> 0:13:2,000
watching Captain Underpants let's face

324
0:13:18.43,000 --> 0:13:22,000
it the shed self is more concerned with

325
0:13:21.19,000 --> 0:13:26,000
doing the right thing in the long run

326
0:13:23.35,000 --> 0:13:28,000
that's Peggy the ordinary person who

327
0:13:26.529,000 --> 0:13:29,000
walks the dog and needs them bran flakes

328
0:13:29.019,000 --> 0:13:32,000
for breakfast

329
0:13:29.889,000 --> 0:13:33,000
in the moment the want self is often

330
0:13:32.319,000 --> 0:13:35,000
stronger no matter how hard you try to

331
0:13:34.63,000 --> 0:13:37,000
push herself to do the work you should

332
0:13:36.279,000 --> 0:13:4,000
be doing it's easy to get pulled into

333
0:13:38.17,000 --> 0:13:42,000
the show you want to be binging like

334
0:13:40.569,000 --> 0:13:45,000
maybe The Handmaid's Tale

335
0:13:42.92,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that's the bad news the good news is

336
0:13:45.949,000 --> 0:13:49,000
that the should self is smarter you can

337
0:13:48.619,000 --> 0:13:52,000
outwit the want self by planning ahead

338
0:13:50.809,000 --> 0:13:54,000
this is a second strategy for beating

339
0:13:53.509,000 --> 0:13:57,000
procrastination that science teaches us

340
0:13:55.459,000 --> 0:14:,000
you don't have to worry about resisting

341
0:13:58.009,000 --> 0:14:03,000
temptation if you remove temptation in

342
0:14:00.699,000 --> 0:14:05,000
college my roommate Palmer was brilliant

343
0:14:03.769,000 --> 0:14:07,000
at this whenever it was time to study

344
0:14:05.989,000 --> 0:14:1,000
for an exam he would ask me to hide his

345
0:14:08.389,000 --> 0:14:13,000
video games you've probably done it to

346
0:14:11.029,000 --> 0:14:15,000
your should self puts the alarm clock

347
0:14:13.459,000 --> 0:14:16,000
across the room at night so your want

348
0:14:15.41,000 --> 0:14:18,000
self can't reach the snooze button in

349
0:14:17.269,000 --> 0:14:22,000
the morning you prevent procrastination

350
0:14:19.22,000 --> 0:14:24,000
by taking willpower out of the equation

351
0:14:22.279,000 --> 0:14:26,000
or maybe your should self announces to

352
0:14:24.98,000 --> 0:14:28,000
the world that you're signing off social

353
0:14:26.629,000 --> 0:14:31,000
media so your want self won't get sucked

354
0:14:29.119,000 --> 0:14:34,000
back in which is what Peggy does for

355
0:14:31.699,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Margaret who loves Twitter and sometimes

356
0:14:34.129,000 --> 0:14:39,000
posts random questions that pop up for

357
0:14:36.649,000 --> 0:14:42,000
instance I put up a picture of a weird

358
0:14:39.619,000 --> 0:14:46,000
mushroom and said what is this because I

359
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
couldn't find it when you're tweeting

360
0:14:46.819,000 --> 0:14:49,000
how often does that happen while you're

361
0:14:49.009,000 --> 0:14:55,000
writing do you actually interrupt

362
0:14:50.449,000 --> 0:14:57,000
yourself or get destroy no I might get

363
0:14:55.399,000 --> 0:15:,000
distracted before I before I take the

364
0:14:58.069,000 --> 0:15:03,000
plunge into the writing burrow but not

365
0:15:00.86,000 --> 0:15:03,000
while I'm in it how do you prevent that

366
0:15:03.23,000 --> 0:15:09,000
from happening is there is there a

367
0:15:04.85,000 --> 0:15:11,000
mental firewall of sorts you turn off

368
0:15:09.61,000 --> 0:15:13,000
for many people easier said than done

369
0:15:12.11,000 --> 0:15:16,000
you just turn it off and that's it yes

370
0:15:14.029,000 --> 0:15:18,000
don't go there

371
0:15:16.32,000 --> 0:15:19,000
it can help to schedule a specific tasks

372
0:15:18.81,000 --> 0:15:21,000
in your calendar the same way you

373
0:15:20.25,000 --> 0:15:24,000
schedule meetings in one experiment

374
0:15:22.47,000 --> 0:15:26,000
writers were randomly assigned to plan

375
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
daily writing sessions they were over

376
0:15:26.79,000 --> 0:15:3,000
four times more productive and they

377
0:15:28.89,000 --> 0:15:32,000
didn't lose any creativity even

378
0:15:30.83,000 --> 0:15:35,000
scheduling 15 minutes a day was enough

379
0:15:33.3,000 --> 0:15:37,000
to make some progress that's time

380
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
management you can also think about

381
0:15:38.25,000 --> 0:15:43,000
timing management when do you

382
0:15:40.95,000 --> 0:15:45,000
procrastinate procrastinators tend to be

383
0:15:43.95,000 --> 0:15:47,000
night owls the start of the work day is

384
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
out of sync with their circadian rhythms

385
0:15:48.3,000 --> 0:15:52,000
if that's you and you have the

386
0:15:50.85,000 --> 0:15:54,000
flexibility try moving a task or you

387
0:15:52.95,000 --> 0:15:57,000
procrastinate to later in the day when

388
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
the wants might be less tempting one of

389
0:15:58.5,000 --> 0:16:02,000
my favorite tactics for outsmarting my

390
0:16:00.54,000 --> 0:16:05,000
wants elf is a twist on the to-do list I

391
0:16:03.21,000 --> 0:16:08,000
found out that Margaret does it too so

392
0:16:05.97,000 --> 0:16:11,000
the list would include everything from

393
0:16:08.28,000 --> 0:16:14,000
call the tree guy to you know clean the

394
0:16:12.42,000 --> 0:16:18,000
furnace if it's not on the list it

395
0:16:14.73,000 --> 0:16:2,000
doesn't happen that's her to-do list but

396
0:16:18.84,000 --> 0:16:23,000
she also has a - don't list a set of

397
0:16:21.69,000 --> 0:16:26,000
activities to avoid while working think

398
0:16:24.63,000 --> 0:16:29,000
about your - don't list what would you

399
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:32,000
put on it when I'm working on my boring

400
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
procrastinate genic tasks like reading

401
0:16:32.52,000 --> 0:16:36,000
contracts and proofreading articles my -

402
0:16:35.25,000 --> 0:16:39,000
don't list includes don't play online

403
0:16:37.41,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Scrabble don't turn on the TV unless I

404
0:16:39.78,000 --> 0:16:42,000
already know what I want to watch and

405
0:16:41.13,000 --> 0:16:47,000
don't scroll on social media after

406
0:16:43.11,000 --> 0:16:49,000
posting Peggy also puts social media on

407
0:16:47.25,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Margaret's - don't list to hold herself

408
0:16:49.71,000 --> 0:16:51,000
accountable she makes a public

409
0:16:51.18,000 --> 0:16:53,000
commitment

410
0:16:51.81,000 --> 0:16:56,000
tweeting that she's signing off - right

411
0:16:53.94,000 --> 0:16:58,000
I'm about to write goodbye that's about

412
0:16:57.3,000 --> 0:17:01,000
going off social media for a while and

413
0:16:59.7,000 --> 0:17:02,000
then and and reassuring people that I'm

414
0:17:01.77,000 --> 0:17:04,000
not dead yet

415
0:17:02.82,000 --> 0:17:07,000
or possibly disappointing them then I'm

416
0:17:04.98,000 --> 0:17:08,000
not dead yet I can't imagine that anyone

417
0:17:08.1,000 --> 0:17:11,000
is disappointed they would be even more

418
0:17:09.9,000 --> 0:17:15,000
excited to hear from me if I were dead

419
0:17:11.79,000 --> 0:17:19,000
they wouldn't be really excited that I'm

420
0:17:16.86,000 --> 0:17:21,000
having a hard time reconciling your self

421
0:17:20.67,000 --> 0:17:24,000
description of being lazy and

422
0:17:22.5,000 --> 0:17:27,000
procrastinating with your enormous

423
0:17:25.35,000 --> 0:17:29,000
productivity well just consider some

424
0:17:27.75,000 --> 0:17:31,000
elementary math

425
0:17:29.57,000 --> 0:17:35,000
take the number of years I've been alive

426
0:17:32.309,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and divide and divide it by the number

427
0:17:35.97,000 --> 0:17:39,000
of books I've written all right so you

428
0:17:38.22,000 --> 0:17:43,000
average less than one a year yes and

429
0:17:40.83,000 --> 0:17:43,000
some are quite short and you don't feel

430
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
like that's a lot

431
0:17:44.22,000 --> 0:17:5,000
no it just dunno they accumulate maybe

432
0:17:48.6,000 --> 0:17:51,000
you can start forgiving your want self

433
0:17:50.58,000 --> 0:17:53,000
for procrastinating

434
0:17:51.75,000 --> 0:17:54,000
maybe you'll succeed at putting some of

435
0:17:54.179,000 --> 0:17:59,000
the should tasks on your calendar and

436
0:17:55.71,000 --> 0:18:,000
some wants on your - don't list still

437
0:17:59.22,000 --> 0:18:03,000
you can't shake the feeling that if only

438
0:18:01.559,000 --> 0:18:05,000
you had more time you could get more

439
0:18:03.48,000 --> 0:18:08,000
done but what if the opposite is true

440
0:18:06.29,000 --> 0:18:12,000
more on that after the break

441

okay this is gonna be a different kind

443
0:18:15.66,000 --> 0:18:18,000
of ad I played a personal role in

444
0:18:17.73,000 --> 0:18:2,000
selecting the sponsors for this podcast

445
0:18:19.14,000 --> 0:18:22,000
because they all have interesting

0:18:20.82,000 --> 0:18:23,000
cultures of their own today we're going

[Music]

449
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:47,000
it's not uncommon for people to say my

450
0:18:45.18,000 --> 0:18:49,000
co-workers feel like my family but I

451
0:18:47.67,000 --> 0:18:51,000
recently met someone who takes that

452
0:18:49.62,000 --> 0:18:53,000
sentiment to a whole new level the

453
0:18:52.17,000 --> 0:18:55,000
Doubletree by Hilton Sonoma wine country

454
0:18:54.21,000 --> 0:19:,000
is my second home

455
0:18:55.91,000 --> 0:19:02,000
everybody here is my family that's

456
0:19:00.6,000 --> 0:19:06,000
Jessica Clingman Kern's a team member at

457
0:19:03.21,000 --> 0:19:09,000
Hilton in October 2017 when wildfires

458
0:19:07.35,000 --> 0:19:11,000
swept through wine country her parents

459
0:19:09.81,000 --> 0:19:13,000
home burned down the fire just kind of

460
0:19:12.23,000 --> 0:19:17,000
completely took over their entire

461
0:19:14.46,000 --> 0:19:18,000
neighborhood and their house was was

462
0:19:17.4,000 --> 0:19:23,000
gone

463
0:19:18.77,000 --> 0:19:25,000
it's hard my brother had passed away

464
0:19:24.18,000 --> 0:19:29,000
just a couple months prior so all of his

465
0:19:26.73,000 --> 0:19:31,000
things around our house just a lot of

466
0:19:29.36,000 --> 0:19:34,000
parts of our life that we'll never get

467
0:19:31.74,000 --> 0:19:36,000
back it was devastating but after

468
0:19:35.07,000 --> 0:19:4,000
sitting with her grief for just a moment

469
0:19:36.99,000 --> 0:19:43,000
Jessica's sprang into action I emptied

470
0:19:40.5,000 --> 0:19:46,000
out my boyfriend's Tahoe and put all my

471
0:19:44.49,000 --> 0:19:49,000
camping stuff in the car and then I went

472
0:19:46.95,000 --> 0:19:5,000
to Walmart and maxed out a credit card

473
0:19:49.53,000 --> 0:19:54,000
with just toothbrushes and toothpaste

474
0:19:51.36,000 --> 0:19:56,000
and deodorant and just little things for

475
0:19:55.05,000 --> 0:19:58,000
someone who left their house at midnight

476
0:19:56.49,000 --> 0:20:,000
and had nothing and I just started

477
0:19:58.92,000 --> 0:20:02,000
driving she headed to the Doubletree to

478
0:20:01.29,000 --> 0:20:05,000
set up a makeshift relief operation a

479
0:20:03.54,000 --> 0:20:07,000
manager provided her with a small

480
0:20:05.64,000 --> 0:20:09,000
conference room which quickly became too

481
0:20:08.25,000 --> 0:20:12,000
small of a conference room I think

482
0:20:10.47,000 --> 0:20:13,000
everyone at the hotel thought I was

483
0:20:12.51,000 --> 0:20:16,000
crazy because I was like oh I just need

484
0:20:14.1,000 --> 0:20:2,000
a little bit more space and then they

485
0:20:17.04,000 --> 0:20:23,000
started seeing semi trucks so my one

486
0:20:20.49,000 --> 0:20:24,000
little room turned into ten thousand

487
0:20:23.19,000 --> 0:20:28,000
square feet a hundred volunteers

488
0:20:25.04,000 --> 0:20:3,000
millions of dollars in donations of the

489
0:20:28.59,000 --> 0:20:32,000
thousands of Californians who lost their

490
0:20:30.6,000 --> 0:20:34,000
homes several were Jessica's colleagues

491
0:20:33.15,000 --> 0:20:38,000
that didn't stop them from volunteering

492
0:20:35.52,000 --> 0:20:4,000
or being a part of everything either so

493
0:20:38.34,000 --> 0:20:41,000
I could not have done it without their

494
0:20:40.68,000 --> 0:20:43,000
support

495
0:20:41.639,000 --> 0:20:45,000
each year Hilton CEO presents the light

496
0:20:44.039,000 --> 0:20:49,000
and warmth the word to a dozen of their

497
0:20:46.549,000 --> 0:20:51,000
425,000 team members it's the highest

498
0:20:49.499,000 --> 0:20:53,000
honor in the company given the people

499
0:20:51.779,000 --> 0:20:55,000
who embody Hilton's vision mission and

500
0:20:53.909,000 --> 0:20:58,000
values I knew about the light and warmth

501
0:20:56.429,000 --> 0:21:02,000
award but I never thought that I would

502
0:20:59.129,000 --> 0:21:04,000
even be thought of experiments show that

503
0:21:02.429,000 --> 0:21:05,000
it's not just the recipients of

504
0:21:04.259,000 --> 0:21:09,000
recognition who end up performing better

505
0:21:06.149,000 --> 0:21:11,000
their colleagues due to awards are not

506
0:21:09.929,000 --> 0:21:12,000
just a powerful way to show the winners

507
0:21:11.639,000 --> 0:21:14,000
that they're valued they're also an

508
0:21:13.529,000 --> 0:21:17,000
important way to signal to everyone

509
0:21:14.94,000 --> 0:21:18,000
what's valued in the culture a few

510
0:21:18.179,000 --> 0:21:21,000
months after the relief effort

511
0:21:19.529,000 --> 0:21:23,000
Jessica headed to a meeting where she

512
0:21:21.599,000 --> 0:21:25,000
was surprised with a phone call it was

513
0:21:23.879,000 --> 0:21:28,000
Hilton CEO she hadn't just been

514
0:21:26.279,000 --> 0:21:31,000
nominated for the award she won so they

515
0:21:29.759,000 --> 0:21:34,000
awarded me with those big obnoxious

516
0:21:32.249,000 --> 0:21:38,000
checks but I looked at the other side

517
0:21:35.129,000 --> 0:21:39,000
and it said $10,000 and I was like oh no

518
0:21:38.549,000 --> 0:21:41,000
come on this is a joke where's the

519
0:21:40.109,000 --> 0:21:44,000
camera right but as soon as it kind of

520
0:21:42.269,000 --> 0:21:46,000
hit me like I thought how else can I

521
0:21:44.82,000 --> 0:21:48,000
help people with this money I can

522
0:21:46.679,000 --> 0:21:52,000
sponsor families for the holidays this

523
0:21:49.529,000 --> 0:21:54,000
year I can donate some of this to

524
0:21:52.679,000 --> 0:21:57,000
rebuilds one of the many people amazed

525
0:21:55.349,000 --> 0:22:01,000
was Jessica's dad when I think back on

526
0:21:58.379,000 --> 0:22:03,000
it you've seen all the work and caring

527
0:22:01.379,000 --> 0:22:06,000
to Jesse put into helping the entire

528
0:22:03.389,000 --> 0:22:09,000
community I mean that in itself makes up

529
0:22:06.69,000 --> 0:22:11,000
for any losses that we had it's just in

530
0:22:09.719,000 --> 0:22:15,000
my nature to help other people that's

531
0:22:12.119,000 --> 0:22:18,000
why I love hospitality Hilton was named

[Music]

539
0:22:46.73,000 --> 0:22:51,000
procrastination is the opposite of

540
0:22:49.29,000 --> 0:22:53,000
productivity it's wasting time or at

541
0:22:52.35,000 --> 0:22:56,000
least using it freely it efficiently

542
0:22:54.08,000 --> 0:22:58,000
we've talked about how individuals can

543
0:22:56.46,000 --> 0:23:01,000
avoid that but I also want to know what

544
0:22:58.71,000 --> 0:23:03,000
organizations can do upon it which might

545
0:23:01.62,000 --> 0:23:05,000
mean thinking differently about what it

546
0:23:03.87,000 --> 0:23:06,000
means to be productive well I think the

547
0:23:06.06,000 --> 0:23:11,000
first question we should ask ourselves

548
0:23:07.8,000 --> 0:23:13,000
is what is work and what is productivity

549
0:23:11.58,000 --> 0:23:15,000
you know nowadays we say work is just a

550
0:23:13.92,000 --> 0:23:17,000
thing you do in a hierarchical

551
0:23:16.08,000 --> 0:23:2,000
relationship with an employer and you

552
0:23:18.03,000 --> 0:23:23,000
get a salary you pay taxes over that and

553
0:23:20.43,000 --> 0:23:26,000
that is what we call work meet Rutger

554
0:23:23.31,000 --> 0:23:29,000
Bregman I'm a Dutch historian and author

555
0:23:26.99,000 --> 0:23:31,000
and why do you feel the need to mention

556
0:23:29.4,000 --> 0:23:33,000
that you're Dutch huh that's a good

557
0:23:32.97,000 --> 0:23:35,000
question well maybe because the

558
0:23:34.32,000 --> 0:23:38,000
Netherlands is the country with the

559
0:23:36.21,000 --> 0:23:4,000
shortest working week in the world and

560
0:23:38.4,000 --> 0:23:42,000
also we have incredibly high

561
0:23:40.34,000 --> 0:23:45,000
productivity per hour so it's it's

562
0:23:43.35,000 --> 0:23:46,000
actually a good of example of my thesis

563
0:23:45.93,000 --> 0:23:47,000
that actually if you want to be more

564
0:23:47.31,000 --> 0:23:5,000
productive

565
0:23:48,000 --> 0:23:52,000
you got to work less how would you

566
0:23:50.55,000 --> 0:23:54,000
define productivity what do you consider

567
0:23:52.74,000 --> 0:23:56,000
a really productive day at work it

568
0:23:55.17,000 --> 0:23:59,000
probably has something to do with time

569
0:23:56.88,000 --> 0:24:01,000
and without put how many hours you spend

570
0:23:59.94,000 --> 0:24:03,000
actually paying attention to your tasks

571
0:24:01.92,000 --> 0:24:04,000
instead of scrolling on Instagram how

572
0:24:04.26,000 --> 0:24:07,000
many boxes on your to-do list you

573
0:24:05.73,000 --> 0:24:11,000
checked but what if you redefine

574
0:24:07.98,000 --> 0:24:13,000
productivity my definition would be work

575
0:24:11.82,000 --> 0:24:15,000
or being productive is just doing

576
0:24:14.25,000 --> 0:24:21,000
something that is valuable right that is

577
0:24:16.8,000 --> 0:24:22,000
useful I like this I think of

578
0:24:21.45,000 --> 0:24:25,000
productivity is using your time to

579
0:24:23.37,000 --> 0:24:28,000
accomplish things of value to you and

580
0:24:25.83,000 --> 0:24:29,000
others whether you use your time well

581
0:24:28.53,000 --> 0:24:32,000
depends on how much of it you have

582
0:24:30.65,000 --> 0:24:34,000
psychologists find that being busy

583
0:24:32.55,000 --> 0:24:35,000
having less time motivates us to finish

584
0:24:35.1,000 --> 0:24:38,000
tasks faster

585
0:24:36.36,000 --> 0:24:41,000
we often procrastinate less when we have

586
0:24:38.67,000 --> 0:24:42,000
more on our plate and actually there's

587
0:24:41.85,000 --> 0:24:44,000
some evidence that people with multiple

588
0:24:43.35,000 --> 0:24:47,000
children are more productive at work

589
0:24:44.91,000 --> 0:24:48,000
than people with one or none new study

590
0:24:47.73,000 --> 0:24:5,000
suggests that parents are more absorbed

591
0:24:49.47,000 --> 0:24:52,000
in their job tasks while at work because

592
0:24:51.69,000 --> 0:24:55,000
they know how much they have to juggle

593
0:24:53.01,000 --> 0:24:59,000
later at home I guess the old saying is

594
0:24:56.07,000 --> 0:25:02,000
true if you want something done give it

595
0:24:59.07,000 --> 0:25:05,000
to a busy person of course your ideal

596
0:25:02.97,000 --> 0:25:06,000
solution of procrastination is not going

597
0:25:05.19,000 --> 0:25:1,000
to be having kids or having even more

598
0:25:07.5,000 --> 0:25:11,000
kids but this research suggests that

599
0:25:10.2,000 --> 0:25:13,000
when you have less time to complete your

600
0:25:11.76,000 --> 0:25:15,000
tasks or more tasks to complete in a

601
0:25:14.04,000 --> 0:25:19,000
given time it can curb procrastination

602
0:25:16.44,000 --> 0:25:2,000
by changing your emotions when you're

603
0:25:19.169,000 --> 0:25:23,000
busy you're more motivated by fear and

604
0:25:21.36,000 --> 0:25:25,000
guilts about falling behind

605
0:25:23.34,000 --> 0:25:27,000
then whatever unpleasant feelings you

606
0:25:25.59,000 --> 0:25:29,000
have around the task itself but when you

607
0:25:28.08,000 --> 0:25:33,000
have a lot of free time you don't feel

608
0:25:30.15,000 --> 0:25:33,000
that urgency to finish there's a name

609
0:25:33.09,000 --> 0:25:36,000
for it

610
0:25:33.679,000 --> 0:25:38,000
Parkinson's law the idea that work

611
0:25:36.179,000 --> 0:25:43,000
contracts or expands to fill the time

612
0:25:38.94,000 --> 0:25:45,000
available I actually experienced this

613
0:25:43.83,000 --> 0:25:48,000
when I was working at a traditional

614
0:25:46.26,000 --> 0:25:5,000
Dutch newspaper and I remember all those

615
0:25:49.5,000 --> 0:25:52,000
afternoons I'm not very productive

616
0:25:50.97,000 --> 0:25:54,000
during the afternoon you know so around

617
0:25:52.86,000 --> 0:25:56,000
4:00 p.m. I just want to start bothering

618
0:25:55.559,000 --> 0:25:59,000
my colleagues and making stupid jokes

619
0:25:57.69,000 --> 0:26:01,000
Rutgers proposed what might seem like a

620
0:25:59.91,000 --> 0:26:03,000
radical solution to those episodes of

621
0:26:02.07,000 --> 0:26:07,000
procrastination shortening the workweek

622
0:26:04.83,000 --> 0:26:09,000
it's not as crazy as it sounds because

623
0:26:07.83,000 --> 0:26:12,000
the whole notion that 40 hours is a

624
0:26:09.96,000 --> 0:26:14,000
magic number for productivity is kind of

625
0:26:13.38,000 --> 0:26:17,000
arbitrary if you look at the history of

626
0:26:15.72,000 --> 0:26:19,000
this it was Henry Ford already at the

627
0:26:18.36,000 --> 0:26:21,000
beginning of the 20th century who

628
0:26:20.28,000 --> 0:26:24,000
already find out that when he moved his

629
0:26:22.32,000 --> 0:26:27,000
workers to a 40-hour work week they were

630
0:26:24.39,000 --> 0:26:29,000
more productive right and he didn't do

631
0:26:27.57,000 --> 0:26:31,000
it because he cared so much about his

632
0:26:30.24,000 --> 0:26:34,000
employees you know he cared about his

633
0:26:31.919,000 --> 0:26:35,000
wallet that was the reason why he did it

634
0:26:34.26,000 --> 0:26:39,000
it was called the American Way working

635
0:26:36.69,000 --> 0:26:4,000
less it's the American Way and actually

636
0:26:39.6,000 --> 0:26:42,000
rutger points out that for more than a

637
0:26:41.61,000 --> 0:26:45,000
century work weeks were getting shorter

638
0:26:43.5,000 --> 0:26:48,000
and shorter in the mid-1800s people

639
0:26:46.169,000 --> 0:26:5,000
often worked 70 hour weeks

640
0:26:48.64,000 --> 0:26:53,000
then around the turn of the century

641
0:26:50.22,000 --> 0:26:57,000
workweek started dropping from 60 to 50

642
0:26:53.98,000 --> 0:26:57,000
hours a week and then it after the

643
0:26:57.58,000 --> 0:27:,000
Second World War

644
0:26:58.36,000 --> 0:27:04,000
economist John Maynard Keynes said we'll

645
0:27:00.82,000 --> 0:27:06,000
have a 15 hour work week in 2030 I

646
0:27:05.04,000 --> 0:27:09,000
promise this is going to tie back to

647
0:27:07.06,000 --> 0:27:1,000
procrastination I'm just putting it off

648
0:27:09.25,000 --> 0:27:12,000
for a little while because I want to

649
0:27:10.99,000 --> 0:27:13,000
know why we're working so many hours

650
0:27:12.43,000 --> 0:27:17,000
today there are lots of possible

651
0:27:14.95,000 --> 0:27:19,000
explanations from rising competition and

652
0:27:17.71,000 --> 0:27:21,000
globalization and consumerism to being

653
0:27:20.38,000 --> 0:27:23,000
obsessed with status at work to just

654
0:27:22.54,000 --> 0:27:25,000
believing more is better

655
0:27:24,000 --> 0:27:27,000
whatever the cause you'll be familiar

656
0:27:26.26,000 --> 0:27:3,000
with what the result looks like now

657
0:27:27.76,000 --> 0:27:31,000
probably at this moment around the globe

658
0:27:30.94,000 --> 0:27:34,000
there are millions of people sitting in

659
0:27:32.5,000 --> 0:27:36,000
offices just waiting browsing Facebook

660
0:27:35.59,000 --> 0:27:38,000
sending emails to people they don't

661
0:27:37.24,000 --> 0:27:41,000
really like writing reports that no

662
0:27:39.34,000 --> 0:27:43,000
one's ever gonna read I think we could

663
0:27:41.83,000 --> 0:27:45,000
easily move to a four-day three-day

664
0:27:43.84,000 --> 0:27:47,000
workweek and be just as productive you

665
0:27:46.39,000 --> 0:27:5,000
just squash out all the slack that's

666
0:27:48.76,000 --> 0:27:54,000
currently in the system how many hours

667
0:27:50.62,000 --> 0:27:58,000
do you actually work I think about 50 to

668
0:27:55.42,000 --> 0:28:02,000
60 if you would define my work as you

669
0:27:59.56,000 --> 0:28:04,000
know I'm I am i working right now this

670
0:28:02.77,000 --> 0:28:05,000
work I don't know does it feel like work

671
0:28:04.66,000 --> 0:28:09,000
are you contributing something valuable

672
0:28:06.64,000 --> 0:28:11,000
to the world well you decide that no I

673
0:28:10.06,000 --> 0:28:13,000
find it very hard to define you know

674
0:28:11.89,000 --> 0:28:14,000
what work is for me

675
0:28:13.09,000 --> 0:28:18,000
I wonder then is there is there some

676
0:28:15.04,000 --> 0:28:2,000
degree of irony that a guy who works 50

677
0:28:18.31,000 --> 0:28:22,000
to 60 hours a week is calling for a 15

678
0:28:20.41,000 --> 0:28:24,000
hour work week yes it's very very ironic

679
0:28:22.84,000 --> 0:28:27,000
oh very I know that I feel like I mean I

680
0:28:25.39,000 --> 0:28:3,000
also I think I work more hours than you

681
0:28:28.39,000 --> 0:28:32,000
do in a typical week and I've also

682
0:28:30.88,000 --> 0:28:33,000
called for shorter work weeks so I part

683
0:28:32.77,000 --> 0:28:37,000
I wanted I wanted to know that I wasn't

684
0:28:34.42,000 --> 0:28:38,000
the only hypocrite out there but yeah

685
0:28:38.17,000 --> 0:28:41,000
we're both crazy

686
0:28:39.19,000 --> 0:28:43,000
exactly but I think that may be the

687
0:28:41.47,000 --> 0:28:45,000
difference between our lives and the

688
0:28:43.93,000 --> 0:28:46,000
policy changes we're calling for is we

689
0:28:46.45,000 --> 0:28:49,000
choose to work this number of hours

690
0:28:47.77,000 --> 0:28:51,000
right I I work as many hours I as I do

691
0:28:50.32,000 --> 0:28:54,000
because I find my work enjoyable and

692
0:28:51.97,000 --> 0:28:56,000
meaningful and what I want is for the

693
0:28:54.88,000 --> 0:28:58,000
hundreds of millions of people who hate

694
0:28:57.34,000 --> 0:29:01,000
their work or who find it extremely

695
0:28:58.96,000 --> 0:29:01,000
stressful to have the freedom to work

696
0:29:01.36,000 --> 0:29:04,000
lest if they so choose

697
0:29:02.62,000 --> 0:29:07,000
yeah you could also frame it like this I

698
0:29:05.049,000 --> 0:29:12,000
think that often we need to work less in

699
0:29:08.2,000 --> 0:29:14,000
order to do more right to have more time

700
0:29:12.34,000 --> 0:29:17,000
for the things that we really care about

701
0:29:15.029,000 --> 0:29:2,000
we should think about productivity not

702
0:29:17.86,000 --> 0:29:22,000
as the volume of output but as the value

703
0:29:20.529,000 --> 0:29:24,000
of output if we're gonna do that then we

704
0:29:23.62,000 --> 0:29:27,000
need to start measuring work in

705
0:29:24.909,000 --> 0:29:29,000
something beyond ours which is starting

706
0:29:28.09,000 --> 0:29:31,000
to happen leaders are beginning to

707
0:29:30.309,000 --> 0:29:34,000
realize there's a big difference between

708
0:29:31.84,000 --> 0:29:35,000
working long hours and doing worthwhile

709
0:29:34.48,000 --> 0:29:37,000
work

710
0:29:35.909,000 --> 0:29:39,000
Finland's new prime minister has spoken

711
0:29:38.11,000 --> 0:29:42,000
in support of a four-day workweek and a

712
0:29:40.269,000 --> 0:29:44,000
six hour work day in the u.s. Shake

713
0:29:42.7,000 --> 0:29:45,000
Shack is trying out a four-day week for

714
0:29:44.5,000 --> 0:29:49,000
managers at many of their locations and

715
0:29:46.529,000 --> 0:29:51,000
recently Microsoft Japan tested the

716
0:29:49.57,000 --> 0:29:54,000
four-day work week productivity climbed

717
0:29:52.299,000 --> 0:29:56,000
by 40 percent there in part because of

718
0:29:55.09,000 --> 0:29:58,000
more focused attention and in part

719
0:29:57.07,000 --> 0:30:,000
because they got rid of unnecessary

720
0:29:58.179,000 --> 0:30:02,000
distractions by making meetings shorter

721
0:30:00.549,000 --> 0:30:04,000
but my favorite example comes from

722
0:30:02.95,000 --> 0:30:05,000
another company it has gone to the

723
0:30:04.899,000 --> 0:30:06,000
extreme to help people use their time

724
0:30:06.58,000 --> 0:30:09,000
more productively

725
0:30:07.559,000 --> 0:30:12,000
even people who are chronic

726
0:30:09.85,000 --> 0:30:13,000
procrastinators I was definitely not

727
0:30:12.7,000 --> 0:30:17,000
Employee of the Year or anything like

728
0:30:14.799,000 --> 0:30:19,000
that just a whole lot of procrastination

729
0:30:17.909,000 --> 0:30:21,000
Jade Walker has struggled with

730
0:30:19.899,000 --> 0:30:23,000
procrastination in the past maybe

731
0:30:22.33,000 --> 0:30:25,000
because she lives in a beautiful part of

732
0:30:24.129,000 --> 0:30:28,000
New Zealand I'm based in tech Epona

733
0:30:26.289,000 --> 0:30:32,000
which is the suburb of Auckland it's

734
0:30:28.919,000 --> 0:30:33,000
like a beach town are you a surfer no

735
0:30:32.679,000 --> 0:30:38,000
I've got two little kids

736
0:30:34.509,000 --> 0:30:42,000
so mom life is how I spend my spare time

737
0:30:38.879,000 --> 0:30:43,000
chasing them around but at work she

738
0:30:42.879,000 --> 0:30:46,000
found herself getting distracted by

739
0:30:44.259,000 --> 0:30:49,000
another kind of surfing oh it's

740
0:30:47.86,000 --> 0:30:53,000
definitely an internet safer online

741
0:30:49.919,000 --> 0:30:56,000
shopping talking to my friends this is

742
0:30:54.85,000 --> 0:30:58,000
really bad but I used to do a grocery

743
0:30:57.429,000 --> 0:31:03,000
shopping online and it gets delivered

744
0:30:59.35,000 --> 0:31:06,000
I love the efficiency of that day my

745
0:31:03.61,000 --> 0:31:08,000
ammo bus probably wouldn't agree maybe

746
0:31:06.759,000 --> 0:31:1,000
then she took a new job in estate

747
0:31:08.919,000 --> 0:31:12,000
planning creating wills for people in

748
0:31:10.87,000 --> 0:31:15,000
the hospital and for navy soldiers about

749
0:31:13.029,000 --> 0:31:18,000
to deploy Jade's new company

750
0:31:15.91,000 --> 0:31:2,000
- a guardian does something unusual they

751
0:31:18.82,000 --> 0:31:23,000
offer a four-day workweek new employees

752
0:31:21.7,000 --> 0:31:24,000
start out at five days and if they prove

753
0:31:24.01,000 --> 0:31:27,000
their productivity in the first few

754
0:31:25.33,000 --> 0:31:3,000
months they get to go down to four days

755
0:31:27.15,000 --> 0:31:33,000
it had a big impact on Jade every

756
0:31:30.49,000 --> 0:31:36,000
weekend I get a screen time report and

757
0:31:33.94,000 --> 0:31:38,000
it used to be horrendously bad my

758
0:31:37.24,000 --> 0:31:41,000
husband would say it sometimes and he'd

759
0:31:39.22,000 --> 0:31:46,000
be like oh my god you spend four hours

760
0:31:41.86,000 --> 0:31:49,000
on your phone a day yeah but now like

761
0:31:47.14,000 --> 0:31:52,000
during the day I don't have time so my

762
0:31:50.38,000 --> 0:31:57,000
screen time has I'm proud to say is

763
0:31:53.05,000 --> 0:32:01,000
between one to two hours a lot less due

764
0:31:57.4,000 --> 0:32:02,000
to the fact that I'm being a lot more

765
0:32:01.12,000 --> 0:32:05,000
productive at work congratulations thank

766
0:32:03.31,000 --> 0:32:08,000
you it's one of the smartest motivators

767
0:32:05.98,000 --> 0:32:08,000
I've ever seen if your productivity

768
0:32:08.47,000 --> 0:32:11,000
backslides

769
0:32:09.4,000 --> 0:32:13,000
you go back to a regular workweek if

770
0:32:11.98,000 --> 0:32:16,000
you're efficient and effective the

771
0:32:14.08,000 --> 0:32:2,000
reward is that you get to work less yes

772
0:32:17.2,000 --> 0:32:22,000
that's a big incentive to not

773
0:32:20.35,000 --> 0:32:26,000
procrastinate we don't have a lot of

774
0:32:22.57,000 --> 0:32:28,000
time to procrastinate anymore you just

775
0:32:26.41,000 --> 0:32:31,000
sort of get in there and get everything

776
0:32:28.96,000 --> 0:32:33,000
done it's completely changed her work

777
0:32:31.78,000 --> 0:32:36,000
process now each morning she spends 15

778
0:32:34.84,000 --> 0:32:38,000
minutes planning her day she color codes

779
0:32:37.24,000 --> 0:32:41,000
emails and writes lists of priorities

780
0:32:39.28,000 --> 0:32:43,000
all this helps her complete one task at

781
0:32:42.01,000 --> 0:32:45,000
a time and move on to the next one

782
0:32:43.42,000 --> 0:32:48,000
instead of trying to do three things at

783
0:32:45.61,000 --> 0:32:52,000
once her productivity and her focus have

784
0:32:49.39,000 --> 0:32:55,000
improved going back to five I don't know

785
0:32:53.16,000 --> 0:33:,000
what I would do for the extra day at

786
0:32:56.32,000 --> 0:33:03,000
work now grocery orders yeah exactly

787
0:33:01.02,000 --> 0:33:06,000
long breaks are you saying you would

788
0:33:03.91,000 --> 0:33:08,000
procrastinate if you had a fifth day yes

789
0:33:06.37,000 --> 0:33:11,000
I probably would now that I'm used to

790
0:33:09.78,000 --> 0:33:15,000
getting everything done and four I think

791
0:33:12.34,000 --> 0:33:18,000
I'd have so much extra time so I

792
0:33:16.24,000 --> 0:33:22,000
probably would procrastinate because

793
0:33:18.61,000 --> 0:33:24,000
yeah I'd have to fill in the day somehow

794
0:33:22.419,000 --> 0:33:26,000
you probably don't have the luxury of

795
0:33:24.73,000 --> 0:33:28,000
just deciding to work fewer hours if

796
0:33:27.279,000 --> 0:33:31,000
you're an hourly retail employee for

797
0:33:28.929,000 --> 0:33:31,000
example your income will take a hit but

798
0:33:31.57,000 --> 0:33:33,000
the shorter work week is a bold

799
0:33:32.799,000 --> 0:33:35,000
demonstration that it's possible to

800
0:33:34.419,000 --> 0:33:39,000
manage our work lives differently more

801
0:33:36.429,000 --> 0:33:4,000
efficiently in any given moment we will

802
0:33:39.759,000 --> 0:33:43,000
always have dilemmas about whether to

803
0:33:41.409,000 --> 0:33:46,000
work and what to work on but take it

804
0:33:44.35,000 --> 0:33:47,000
from Margaret Atwood the tasks you're

805
0:33:46.419,000 --> 0:33:5,000
putting off isn't always the one you

806
0:33:48.009,000 --> 0:33:52,000
hate it might be the one you fear the

807
0:33:50.95,000 --> 0:33:52,000
one that's ultimately the most worth

808
0:33:52.539,000 --> 0:33:55,000
pursuing

809
0:33:53.169,000 --> 0:33:58,000
at least that's how it was for The

810
0:33:55.749,000 --> 0:33:59,000
Handmaid's Tale I did try to write this

811
0:33:58.21,000 --> 0:34:02,000
more normal novel and it really just did

812
0:34:00.1,000 --> 0:34:05,000
not work out so that was a signal that I

813
0:34:02.98,000 --> 0:34:07,000
had to write the batting one or nothing

814
0:34:05.639,000 --> 0:34:09,000
if you're gonna do the task eventually

815
0:34:08.23,000 --> 0:34:13,000
you might as well spare yourself the

816
0:34:10.03,000 --> 0:34:16,000
agony and start it sooner I called that

817
0:34:13.629,000 --> 0:34:19,000

being trapped in this system where

0:34:35.22,000 --> 0:34:4,000
you're on like a hamster wheel you know

827
0:34:40.62,000 --> 0:34:46,000
it really changing anything job burnout

828
0:34:43.77,000 --> 0:34:48,000

around and then this young woman who is

856
0:35:52.24,000 --> 0:35:58,000

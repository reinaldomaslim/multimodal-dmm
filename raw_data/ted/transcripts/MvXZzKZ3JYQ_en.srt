1
0:00:13.995,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Every weekend for as long as I can remember,

2
0:00:17.746,000 --> 0:00:19,000
my father would get up on a Saturday,

3
0:00:20.597,000 --> 0:00:21,000
put on a worn sweatshirt

4
0:00:23.163,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and he'd scrape away

5
0:00:24.342,000 --> 0:00:26,000
at the squeaky old wheel of a house that we lived in.

6
0:00:27.681,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I wouldn't even call it restoration;

7
0:00:29.493,000 --> 0:00:3,000
it was a ritual, catharsis.

8
0:00:31.906,000 --> 0:00:34,000
He would spend all year scraping paint with this old heat gun

9
0:00:35.29,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and a spackle knife,

10
0:00:36.558,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and then he would repaint where he scraped,

11
0:00:38.659,000 --> 0:00:4,000
only to begin again the following year.

12
0:00:41.052,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Scraping and re-scraping, painting and repainting:

13
0:00:44.688,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the work of an old house is never meant to be done.

14
0:00:49.589,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The day my father turned 52, I got a phone call.

15
0:00:52.945,000 --> 0:00:53,000
My mother was on the line

16
0:00:54.391,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach --

17
0:00:58.153,000 --> 0:01:,000
terminal cancer, she told me,

18
0:01:00.196,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and he had been given only three weeks to live.

19
0:01:04.269,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I immediately moved home to Poughkeepsie, New York,

20
0:01:07.814,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to sit with my father on death watch,

21
0:01:10.246,000 --> 0:01:12,000
not knowing what the next days would bring us.

22
0:01:13.529,000 --> 0:01:14,000
To keep myself distracted,

23
0:01:14.92,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I rolled up my sleeves,

24
0:01:16.698,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and I went about finishing what he could now no longer complete --

25
0:01:20.627,000 --> 0:01:22,000
the restoration of our old home.

26
0:01:23.666,000 --> 0:01:26,000
When that looming three-week deadline came

27
0:01:26.731,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and then went,

28
0:01:27.913,000 --> 0:01:28,000
he was still alive.

29
0:01:29.904,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And at three months,

30
0:01:31.41,000 --> 0:01:32,000
he joined me.

31
0:01:32.901,000 --> 0:01:34,000
We gutted and repainted the interior.

32
0:01:35.6,000 --> 0:01:38,000
At six months, the old windows were refinished,

33
0:01:38.918,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and at 18 months,

34
0:01:40.237,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the rotted porch was finally replaced.

35
0:01:43.575,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And there was my father,

36
0:01:45.427,000 --> 0:01:48,000
standing with me outside, admiring a day's work,

37
0:01:48.704,000 --> 0:01:5,000
hair on his head, fully in remission,

38
0:01:51.727,000 --> 0:01:53,000
when he turned to me and he said,

39
0:01:53.985,000 --> 0:01:54,000
"You know, Michael,

40
0:01:55.166,000 --> 0:01:56,000
this house saved my life."

41
0:01:58.967,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So the following year, I decided to go to architecture school.

42
0:02:04.167,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:05.929,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But there, I learned something different about buildings.

44
0:02:09.073,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Recognition seemed to come

45
0:02:10.728,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to those who prioritized novel and sculptural forms,

46
0:02:14.303,000 --> 0:02:16,000
like ribbons, or ...

47
0:02:17.514,000 --> 0:02:18,000
pickles?

48
0:02:18.697,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:22.866,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And I think this is supposed to be a snail.

50
0:02:26.53,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Something about this bothered me.

51
0:02:28.971,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Why was it that the best architects, the greatest architecture --

52
0:02:32.938,000 --> 0:02:34,000
all beautiful and visionary and innovative --

53
0:02:36.078,000 --> 0:02:38,000
is also so rare,

54
0:02:38.273,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and seems to serve so very few?

55
0:02:41.715,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And more to the point:

56
0:02:43.236,000 --> 0:02:46,000
With all of this creative talent, what more could we do?

57
0:02:48.556,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Just as I was about to start my final exams,

58
0:02:50.889,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I decided to take a break from an all-nighter

59
0:02:54.018,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and go to a lecture by Dr. Paul Farmer,

60
0:02:57.514,000 --> 0:02:59,000
a leading health activist for the global poor.

61
0:03:00.534,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I was surprised to hear a doctor talking about architecture.

62
0:03:04.34,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Buildings are making people sicker, he said,

63
0:03:06.846,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and for the poorest in the world,

64
0:03:08.663,000 --> 0:03:1,000
this is causing epidemic-level problems.

65
0:03:11.918,000 --> 0:03:12,000
In this hospital in South Africa,

66
0:03:13.577,000 --> 0:03:15,000
patients that came in with, say, a broken leg,

67
0:03:15.785,000 --> 0:03:17,000
to wait in this unventilated hallway,

68
0:03:18.405,000 --> 0:03:22,000
walked out with a multidrug-resistant strand of tuberculosis.

69
0:03:23.294,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Simple designs for infection control had not been thought about,

70
0:03:26.942,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and people had died because of it.

71
0:03:30.014,000 --> 0:03:33,000
"Where are the architects?" Paul said.

72
0:03:33.692,000 --> 0:03:35,000
If hospitals are making people sicker,

73
0:03:35.717,000 --> 0:03:36,000
where are the architects and designers

74
0:03:37.645,000 --> 0:03:41,000
to help us build and design hospitals that allow us to heal?

75
0:03:44.486,000 --> 0:03:45,000
That following summer,

76
0:03:46.15,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I was in the back of a Land Rover with a few classmates,

77
0:03:48.976,000 --> 0:03:51,000
bumping over the mountainous hillside of Rwanda.

78
0:03:52.964,000 --> 0:03:55,000
For the next year, I'd be living in Butaro in this old guesthouse,

79
0:03:56.957,000 --> 0:03:59,000
which was a jail after the genocide.

80
0:04:00.967,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I was there to design and build a new type of hospital

81
0:04:04.912,000 --> 0:04:06,000
with Dr. Farmer and his team.

82
0:04:07.965,000 --> 0:04:09,000
If hallways are making patients sicker,

83
0:04:10.123,000 --> 0:04:13,000
what if we could design a hospital that flips the hallways on the outside,

84
0:04:13.901,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and makes people walk in the exterior?

85
0:04:16.243,000 --> 0:04:18,000
If mechanical systems rarely work,

86
0:04:18.636,000 --> 0:04:2,000
what if we could design a hospital that could breathe

87
0:04:21.243,000 --> 0:04:22,000
through natural ventilation,

88
0:04:23.143,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and meanwhile reduce its environmental footprint?

89
0:04:26.309,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And what about the patients' experience?

90
0:04:28.889,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Evidence shows that a simple view of nature

91
0:04:31.229,000 --> 0:04:33,000
can radically improve health outcomes,

92
0:04:33.752,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So why couldn't we design a hospital

93
0:04:35.838,000 --> 0:04:37,000
where every patient had a window with a view?

94
0:04:38.575,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Simple, site-specific designs can make a hospital that heals.

95
0:04:44.764,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Designing it is one thing;

96
0:04:46.571,000 --> 0:04:48,000
getting it built, we learned, is quite another.

97
0:04:49.619,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We worked with Bruce Nizeye,

98
0:04:52.327,000 --> 0:04:53,000
a brilliant engineer,

99
0:04:53.864,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and he thought about construction differently

100
0:04:56.012,000 --> 0:04:57,000
than I had been taught in school.

101
0:04:58.458,000 --> 0:05:,000
When we had to excavate this enormous hilltop

102
0:05:00.806,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and a bulldozer was expensive and hard to get to site,

103
0:05:03.765,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Bruce suggested doing it by hand,

104
0:05:06.309,000 --> 0:05:09,000
using a method in Rwanda called "Ubudehe,"

105
0:05:10.007,000 --> 0:05:12,000
which means "community works for the community."

106
0:05:13.082,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Hundreds of people came with shovels and hoes,

107
0:05:17.008,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and we excavated that hill

108
0:05:18.819,000 --> 0:05:21,000
in half the time and half the cost of that bulldozer.

109
0:05:23.328,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Instead of importing furniture, Bruce started a guild,

110
0:05:26.292,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and he brought in master carpenters to train others

111
0:05:28.723,000 --> 0:05:29,000
in how to make furniture by hand.

112
0:05:30.501,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And on this job site,

113
0:05:32.095,000 --> 0:05:35,000
15 years after the Rwandan genocide,

114
0:05:36.326,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Bruce insisted that we bring on labor from all backgrounds,

115
0:05:39.955,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and that half of them be women.

116
0:05:42.302,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Bruce was using the process of building to heal,

117
0:05:44.971,000 --> 0:05:45,000
not just for those who were sick,

118
0:05:46.98,000 --> 0:05:48,000
but for the entire community as a whole.

119
0:05:51.086,000 --> 0:05:55,000
We call this the locally fabricated way of building, or "lo-fab,"

120
0:05:55.965,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and it has four pillars:

121
0:05:58.984,000 --> 0:05:59,000
hire locally,

122
0:06:00.182,000 --> 0:06:01,000
source regionally,

123
0:06:02.111,000 --> 0:06:03,000
train where you can

124
0:06:03.555,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and most importantly,

125
0:06:05.143,000 --> 0:06:08,000
think about every design decision as an opportunity

126
0:06:08.729,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to invest in the dignity of the places where you serve.

127
0:06:13.219,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Think of it like the local food movement,

128
0:06:16.073,000 --> 0:06:17,000
but for architecture.

129
0:06:17.741,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And we're convinced that this way of building

130
0:06:19.968,000 --> 0:06:2,000
can be replicated across the world,

131
0:06:21.93,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and change the way we talk about and evaluate architecture.

132
0:06:27.405,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Using the lo-fab way of building,

133
0:06:29.231,000 --> 0:06:32,000
even aesthetic decisions can be designed to impact people's lives.

134
0:06:33.762,000 --> 0:06:35,000
In Butaro, we chose to use a local volcanic stone

135
0:06:36.488,000 --> 0:06:38,000
found in abundance within the area,

136
0:06:38.54,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but often considered a nuisance by farmers,

137
0:06:40.601,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and piled on the side of the road.

138
0:06:42.671,000 --> 0:06:44,000
We worked with these masons to cut these stones

139
0:06:45.179,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and form them into the walls of the hospital.

140
0:06:48.394,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And when they began on this corner

141
0:06:50.615,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and wrapped around the entire hospital,

142
0:06:54.283,000 --> 0:06:56,000
they were so good at putting these stones together,

143
0:06:56.829,000 --> 0:06:59,000
they asked us if they could take down the original wall and rebuild it.

144
0:07:00.465,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And you see what is possible.

145
0:07:03.467,000 --> 0:07:04,000
It's beautiful.

146
0:07:05.794,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And the beauty, to me,

147
0:07:07.697,000 --> 0:07:1,000
comes from the fact that I know that hands cut these stones,

148
0:07:11.435,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and they formed them into this thick wall,

149
0:07:14.444,000 --> 0:07:17,000
made only in this place with rocks from this soil.

150
0:07:20.107,000 --> 0:07:24,000
When you go outside today and you look at your built world,

151
0:07:24.973,000 --> 0:07:25,000
ask not only:

152
0:07:26.178,000 --> 0:07:29,000
"What is the environmental footprint?" -- an important question --

153
0:07:29.428,000 --> 0:07:3,000
but what if we also asked,

154
0:07:30.726,000 --> 0:07:33,000
"What is the human handprint of those who made it?"

155
0:07:35.427,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We started a new practice based around these questions,

156
0:07:39.095,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and we tested it around the world.

157
0:07:42.467,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Like in Haiti,

158
0:07:43.642,000 --> 0:07:47,000
where we asked if a new hospital could help end the epidemic of cholera.

159
0:07:48.755,000 --> 0:07:49,000
In this 100-bed hospital,

160
0:07:50.418,000 --> 0:07:51,000
we designed a simple strategy

161
0:07:52.117,000 --> 0:07:56,000
to clean contaminated medical waste before it enters the water table,

162
0:07:56.601,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and our partners at Les Centres GHESKIO

163
0:07:58.633,000 --> 0:08:,000
are already saving lives because of it.

164
0:08:01.187,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Or Malawi:

165
0:08:02.406,000 --> 0:08:05,000
we asked if a birthing center could radically reduce

166
0:08:05.659,000 --> 0:08:06,000
maternal and infant mortality.

167
0:08:07.892,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Malawi has one of the highest rates of maternal and infant death

168
0:08:11.169,000 --> 0:08:12,000
in the world.

169
0:08:12.41,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Using a simple strategy to be replicated nationally,

170
0:08:15.757,000 --> 0:08:17,000
we designed a birthing center

171
0:08:18.001,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that would attract women and their attendants

172
0:08:20.333,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to come to the hospital earlier and therefore have safer births.

173
0:08:24.569,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Or in the Congo, where we asked

174
0:08:26.267,000 --> 0:08:28,000
if an educational center could also be used

175
0:08:28.539,000 --> 0:08:3,000
to protect endangered wildlife.

176
0:08:30.745,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Poaching for ivory and bushmeat

177
0:08:32.354,000 --> 0:08:35,000
is leading to global epidemic, disease transfer and war.

178
0:08:35.925,000 --> 0:08:38,000
In one of the hardest-to-reach places in the world,

179
0:08:39.171,000 --> 0:08:41,000
we used the mud and the dirt and the wood around us

180
0:08:42.121,000 --> 0:08:43,000
to construct a center

181
0:08:43.809,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that would show us ways to protect and conserve our rich biodiversity.

182
0:08:49.526,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Even here in the US,

183
0:08:51.155,000 --> 0:08:52,000
we were asked to rethink

184
0:08:52.442,000 --> 0:08:56,000
the largest university for the deaf and hard of hearing in the world.

185
0:08:56.844,000 --> 0:08:58,000
The deaf community, through sign language,

186
0:08:59.124,000 --> 0:09:01,000
shows us the power of visual communication.

187
0:09:01.558,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We designed a campus that would awaken the ways

188
0:09:03.834,000 --> 0:09:05,000
in which we as humans all communicate,

189
0:09:05.907,000 --> 0:09:06,000
both verbally and nonverbally.

190
0:09:09.729,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And even in Poughkeepsie, my hometown,

191
0:09:12.986,000 --> 0:09:14,000
we thought about old industrial infrastructure.

192
0:09:16.196,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We wondered:

193
0:09:17.497,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Could we use arts and culture and design to revitalize this city

194
0:09:22.084,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and other Rust Belt cities across our nation,

195
0:09:24.73,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and turn them into centers for innovation and growth?

196
0:09:28.121,000 --> 0:09:31,000
In each of these projects, we asked a simple question:

197
0:09:32.045,000 --> 0:09:34,000
What more can architecture do?

198
0:09:34.681,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And by asking that question,

199
0:09:36.63,000 --> 0:09:39,000
we were forced to consider how we could create jobs,

200
0:09:40.396,000 --> 0:09:42,000
how we could source regionally

201
0:09:42.831,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and how we could invest in the dignity of the communities

202
0:09:46.081,000 --> 0:09:47,000
in which we serve.

203
0:09:47.959,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I have learned

204
0:09:49.943,000 --> 0:09:53,000
that architecture can be a transformative engine for change.

205
0:09:57.117,000 --> 0:09:59,000
About a year ago, I read an article

206
0:10:00.567,000 --> 0:10:04,000
about a tireless and intrepid civil rights leader

207
0:10:05.328,000 --> 0:10:06,000
named Bryan Stevenson.

208
0:10:08.423,000 --> 0:10:11,000
(Applause)

209
0:10:14.249,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And Bryan had a bold architectural vision.

210
0:10:17.983,000 --> 0:10:19,000
He and his team had been documenting

211
0:10:20.596,000 --> 0:10:23,000
the over 4,000 lynchings of African-Americans

212
0:10:24.264,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that have happened in the American South.

213
0:10:26.889,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And they had a plan to mark every county where these lynchings occurred,

214
0:10:31.723,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and build a national memorial to the victims of lynching

215
0:10:35.136,000 --> 0:10:36,000
in Montgomery, Alabama.

216
0:10:37.879,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Countries like Germany and South Africa

217
0:10:41.88,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and, of course, Rwanda,

218
0:10:43.073,000 --> 0:10:46,000
have found it necessary to build memorials

219
0:10:46.169,000 --> 0:10:48,000
to reflect on the atrocities of their past,

220
0:10:49.032,000 --> 0:10:51,000
in order to heal their national psyche.

221
0:10:52.044,000 --> 0:10:55,000
We have yet to do this in the United States.

222
0:10:56.679,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So I sent a cold email to info@equaljusticeintiative.org:

223
0:11:03.338,000 --> 0:11:04,000
"Dear Bryan," it said,

224
0:11:06.102,000 --> 0:11:07,000
"I think your building project

225
0:11:07.762,000 --> 0:11:09,000
is maybe the most important project we could do in America

226
0:11:10.741,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and could change the way we think about racial injustice.

227
0:11:14.64,000 --> 0:11:15,000
By any chance,

228
0:11:16.648,000 --> 0:11:17,000
do you know who will design it?"

229
0:11:18.593,000 --> 0:11:19,000
(Laughter)

230
0:11:20.784,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Surprisingly, shockingly,

231
0:11:23.547,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Bryan got right back to me,

232
0:11:24.885,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and invited me down to meet with his team and talk to them.

233
0:11:28.763,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Needless to say, I canceled all my meetings

234
0:11:30.839,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and I jumped on a plane to Montgomery, Alabama.

235
0:11:33.203,000 --> 0:11:34,000
When I got there,

236
0:11:34.797,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Bryan and his team picked me up, and we walked around the city.

237
0:11:38.305,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And they took the time to point out

238
0:11:40.656,000 --> 0:11:43,000
the many markers that have been placed all over the city

239
0:11:43.701,000 --> 0:11:45,000
to the history of the Confederacy,

240
0:11:46.169,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and the very few that mark the history of slavery.

241
0:11:50.42,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And then he walked me to a hill.

242
0:11:52.828,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It overlooked the whole city.

243
0:11:54.934,000 --> 0:11:56,000
He pointed out the river and the train tracks

244
0:11:57.188,000 --> 0:11:59,000
where the largest domestic slave-trading port in America

245
0:11:59.907,000 --> 0:12:,000
had once prospered.

246
0:12:01.115,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And then to the Capitol rotunda,

247
0:12:02.757,000 --> 0:12:04,000
where George Wallace had stood on its steps

248
0:12:04.853,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and proclaimed, "Segregation forever."

249
0:12:08.205,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And then to the very hill below us.

250
0:12:10.08,000 --> 0:12:13,000
He said, "Here we will build a new memorial

251
0:12:13.421,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that will change the identity of this city and of this nation."

252
0:12:18.855,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Our two teams have worked together over the last year

253
0:12:22.333,000 --> 0:12:23,000
to design this memorial.

254
0:12:27.184,000 --> 0:12:29,000
The memorial will take us on a journey

255
0:12:30.836,000 --> 0:12:33,000
through a classical, almost familiar building type,

256
0:12:33.934,000 --> 0:12:37,000
like the Parthenon or the colonnade at the Vatican.

257
0:12:38.994,000 --> 0:12:39,000
But as we enter,

258
0:12:40.345,000 --> 0:12:43,000
the ground drops below us and our perception shifts,

259
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
where we realize that these columns evoke the lynchings,

260
0:12:48.448,000 --> 0:12:5,000
which happened in the public square.

261
0:12:51.005,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And as we continue,

262
0:12:52.345,000 --> 0:12:55,000
we begin to understand the vast number

263
0:12:55.464,000 --> 0:12:57,000
of those who have yet to be put to rest.

264
0:12:58.481,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Their names will be engraved on the markers that hang above us.

265
0:13:04.202,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And just outside will be a field of identical columns.

266
0:13:08.973,000 --> 0:13:11,000
But these are temporary columns, waiting in purgatory,

267
0:13:12.796,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to be placed in the very counties where these lynchings occurred.

268
0:13:18.124,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Over the next few years,

269
0:13:20.52,000 --> 0:13:21,000
this site will bear witness,

270
0:13:23.06,000 --> 0:13:25,000
as each of these markers is claimed

271
0:13:25.322,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and visibly placed in those counties.

272
0:13:28.258,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Our nation will begin to heal from over a century of silence.

273
0:13:35.799,000 --> 0:13:37,000
When we think about how it should be built,

274
0:13:37.876,000 --> 0:13:39,000
we were reminded of Ubudehe,

275
0:13:40.7,000 --> 0:13:42,000
the building process we learned about in Rwanda.

276
0:13:43.562,000 --> 0:13:45,000
We wondered if we could fill those very columns

277
0:13:46.13,000 --> 0:13:49,000
with the soil from the sites of where these killings occurred.

278
0:13:51.218,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Brian and his team have begun collecting that soil

279
0:13:54.94,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and preserving it in individual jars

280
0:13:57.748,000 --> 0:14:,000
with family members, community leaders and descendants.

281
0:14:01.89,000 --> 0:14:04,000
The act of collecting soil itself

282
0:14:06.148,000 --> 0:14:08,000
has lead to a type of spiritual healing.

283
0:14:09.545,000 --> 0:14:11,000
It's an act of restorative justice.

284
0:14:12.844,000 --> 0:14:14,000
As one EJI team member noted

285
0:14:15.422,000 --> 0:14:19,000
in the collection of the soil from where Will McBride was lynched,

286
0:14:20.231,000 --> 0:14:23,000
"If Will McBride left one drop of sweat,

287
0:14:23.388,000 --> 0:14:24,000
one drop of blood,

288
0:14:25.173,000 --> 0:14:26,000
one hair follicle --

289
0:14:26.964,000 --> 0:14:27,000
I pray that I dug it up,

290
0:14:28.609,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and that his whole body would be at peace."

291
0:14:34.683,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We plan to break ground on this memorial later this year,

292
0:14:37.968,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and it will be a place to finally speak of the unspeakable acts

293
0:14:42.437,000 --> 0:14:43,000
that have scarred this nation.

294
0:14:46.38,000 --> 0:14:51,000
(Applause)

295
0:14:57.245,000 --> 0:15:,000
When my father told me that day that this house --

296
0:15:00.706,000 --> 0:15:01,000
our house --

297
0:15:01.885,000 --> 0:15:02,000
had saved his life,

298
0:15:03.97,000 --> 0:15:04,000
what I didn't know

299
0:15:05.306,000 --> 0:15:08,000
was that he was referring to a much deeper relationship

300
0:15:08.582,000 --> 0:15:1,000
between architecture and ourselves.

301
0:15:11.649,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Buildings are not simply expressive sculptures.

302
0:15:15.019,000 --> 0:15:19,000
They make visible our personal and our collective aspirations

303
0:15:19.141,000 --> 0:15:2,000
as a society.

304
0:15:21.177,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Great architecture can give us hope.

305
0:15:25.162,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Great architecture can heal.

306
0:15:28.478,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Thank you very much.

307
0:15:29.719,000 --> 0:15:36,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I'm a, or was, or kind of am a toy designer.

2
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And before I was a toy designer, oh, I was a mime, a street mime, actually.

3
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And then I was an entertainer, I guess.

4
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And before that, I was a silversmith, and before that, I was --

5
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I was out of the house at about 15 and a half,

6
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and I never wound up going into college.

7
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I didn't really -- I didn't see the point at the time.

8
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I do now, after learning about all the quantum stuff.

9
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It's really cool.

11
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Anyway, I wanted to show you a little bit about the world of toy design,

12
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
at least from my small aperture of the world.

13
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
This is a video I made when I first started doing toy design.

14
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
I'm in my garage, making weird stuff.

15
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And then you go to these toy companies

16
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and there's some guy across the table,

17
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and he goes, "Pass. Pass. Pass."

18
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
You know, you think it's so cool, but they --

19
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
anyway, I made this little tape that I'd always show when I go in.

20
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
This is the name of my company, Giving Toys.

21
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So I used to work at Mattel, actually.

22
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And after I left Mattel, I started all these hamburger makers,

23
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and then got the license to make the maker.

24
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So this is a hamburger maker that

25
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
you take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there, and it makes --

26
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and this is a French fry maker, little, tiny food you can eat.

27
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I beat up the pasta maker to make that.

28
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Then this is a McNugget maker, I think.

29
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
This, now that's the McNugget maker,

30
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and this is a -- this is my oldest daughter making a McApple Pie.

31
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And let's see, you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar,

32
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and then you eat, and you eat, and you eat, and you --

33
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
she's about 300 pounds now.

34
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
No, she's not, she's beautiful.

35
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
This is how they looked when they came out at the end.

36
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
These are a -- this is like a 15 million dollar line.

37
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And it got me through some -- I didn't make any royalties on this, but it got me through.

38
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Next is a compilation of a bunch of stuff.

39
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
That was a missile foam launcher that didn't get sold.

40
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
This is a squishy head, for no apparent reason.

41
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
This is some effects that I did for "Wig, Rattle and Roll."

42
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
That was a robot eye thing controlling it in the back.

43
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
That paid the rent for about a month.

44
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
This is a walking Barbie -- I said, "Oh, this is it!"

45
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And they go, "Oh, that's really nice," and out it goes.

46
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So this is some fighting robots. I thought everyone would want these.

47
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
They fight, they get back up, you know? Wouldn't this be cool?

48
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And they made it into a toy, and then they dropped it like a hot rock.

49
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
They're pretty cool.

50
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
This is a-- we're doing some flight-testing

51
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
on my little pug, seeing if this can really grab.

52
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
It does pretty good.

53
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I'm using little phone connectors to make them so they can spin.

54
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It's how they, see, have those album things -- kids don't know what they are.

55
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
This is a clay maker.

56
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
You know, I said -- I went to Play-Doh,

57
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and said, "Look, I can animate this."

58
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
They said, "Don't talk to us about Play-Doh."

59
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And then, I made a Lego animator.

60
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I thought, this would be so great!

61
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And you know, Lego -- don't take Legos to Lego.

62
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
That's the answer. They know everything about it.

63
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Then I started doing animatronics.

64
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I loved dinosaurs.

65
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I used to be in the film business, kind of,

66
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and actually, Nicholas Negroponte saw this when I was, like, 12,

67
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and anyway, so then they said, "No, you have to make two and they have to fight."

68
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
You know, how -- why would a kid want a dinosaur?

69
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
This is me using [unclear] or 3-D Studio, back in the '80s.

70
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
That's David Letterman.

71
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
You can see how old this stuff is.

72
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
That's my youngest cousin.

73
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
This is a segment called, "Dangerous Toys You Won't See at Christmas."

74
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We had my first saw blade launcher and we had a flamethrower chair.

75
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
My career basically peaked here.

76
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And in the back are foam-core cutouts of the people who couldn't make it to the show.

77
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
This is MEK going through a windshield wiper motor.

78
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So this is a -- I used to kind of be an actor.

79
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And I'm really not very good at it.

80
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But the -- this is a guy named Dr. Yatz,

81
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
who would take toys apart and show kids about engineering.

82
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And you can see the massively parallel processing Nintendos there.

83
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And over to the left is a view master of the CD-ROM.

84
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And a guy named Stan Reznikov did this as a pilot.

85
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
This is a -- you can see the little window there.

86
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
You can actually see the Steadicam with a bubble on the bottom.

87
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
You see the keyboard strapped to my wrist.

88
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Way ahead of my time here.

89
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Video) I'm getting dizzy ...

90
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Narrator: I love toys!

91
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Caleb Chung: That's all I wanted to say there. I love toys.

92
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
OK, so, so that was a, that was the first kind of a --

93
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that was the first batch of products.

94
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Most of them did not go.

95
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
You get one out of 20, one out of 30 products.

96
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And every now and then, we do something like a,

97
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
you know, an automated hair wrap machine, you know,

98
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out, and --

99
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and we'd make some money on that, you know. And we'd give it out.

100
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But eventually, we left L.A., and we moved to Idaho,

101
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
where there was actually a lot of peace and quiet.

102
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And I started working on this project

103
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
-- oh, I have to tell you about this real quick.

104
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Throughout this whole thing, making toys,

105
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science.

106
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
There's some kind of a blend that happens

107
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that allows, you know, to find innovation.

108
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And I tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol

109
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that means something, to me anyway.

110
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And so, art and science have a kind of dynamic balance,

111
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that's where I think innovation happens.

112
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And actually, this is, to me, how I can come up with great ideas.

113
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But it's not how you actually get leverage.

114
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Actually, you have to put a circle around that, and call it business.

115
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And those three together, I think, give you leverage in the world.

116
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
But moving on.

117
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So, this is a quick tale I'm going to tell. This is the Furby tale.

118
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
As he said, I was co-inventor of the Furby.

119
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I did the body and creature -- well, you'll see.

120
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So by way of showing you this, you can kind of

121
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
get an understanding of what it is to,

122
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
hopefully, try to create robotic life forms, or technology

123
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that has an emotional connection with the user.

124
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So this is my family.

125
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
This is my wife, Christi, and Abby, and Melissa,

126
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and my 17-year-old now, Emily, who was just a pack of trouble.

127
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
All right, there's that robot again.

128
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I came out of the movie business, as I said,

129
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and I said, let's make these animatronic robots.

130
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Let's make these things.

131
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And so I've always had a big interest in this.

132
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
This one actually didn't go anywhere,

133
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but I got my feet wet doing this.

134
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
This is a smaller one, and I have a little moving torso on there.

135
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
A little, tiny guy walks along. More servo drives,

136
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
lots of servo hacking, lots of mechanical stuff.

137
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
There's another one.

138
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
He actually has skeletor legs, I think, he's wearing there.

139
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Oh, this is a little pony, little pony -- very cute little thing.

140
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The point of showing these is I've always been interested in little artificial life pieces.

141
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So the challenge was -- I worked for Microsoft for a little bit,

142
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
working on the Microsoft Barney.

143
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And this is a -- you know, the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear.

144
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And, you know, they had lots, just lots of stuff in there that you didn't need, I thought.

145
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And then Microsoft can just fill a, you know, a warehouse

146
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
full of this stuff and see if they sell.

147
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So it's a really strange business model compared to coming from a toy company.

148
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But anyway, a friend of mine and I, Dave Hampton,

149
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
decided to see if we could do like a single-cell organism.

150
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
What's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form?

151
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And that's our little, thirty-cent Mabuchi motor.

152
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And so, I have all these design books,

153
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
like I'm sure many of you have.

154
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And throughout the books -- this is the first page on Furby --

155
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I have kind of the art and science.

156
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I have the why over here, and the how over there.

157
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I try to do a lot of philosophy, a lot of thinking about all of these projects.

158
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Because they're not just "bing" ideas;

159
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
you have to really dig deep in these things.

160
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So there's some real pseudo-code over here,

161
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and getting the idea of different kind of drives, things like that.

162
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And originally, Furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom.

163
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And then we said, well, you're going to feed him,

164
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and he needs to talk, and it got more complicated.

165
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And then I had to figure out how I'm going to use that one motor

166
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to make the eyes move, and the ears move,

167
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and the body to move, and the mouth to move.

168
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And, you know, I want to make it blink

169
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and do all that at the same time.

170
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Well, I came up with this kind of linear

171
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
expression thing with these cams and feedback. And that worked pretty well.

172
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Then I started to get a little more realistic

173
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and I have to start drawing the stuff.

174
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And there's my "note to self" at the top:

175
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
"lots of engineering."

176
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So that turned out to be a little more than true.

177
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
There's my first exploded view and all the little pieces

178
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and the little worm drive and all that stuff.

179
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And then I've got to start building it,

180
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
so this is the real thing.

181
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I get up and start cutting my finger and gluing things together.

182
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And that's my little workshop.

183
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And there's the first little cam that drove Furby.

184
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And there's Furby on the half shell.

185
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
You can see the little BB in the box is my tilt sensor.

186
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic.

187
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So there's the back of his head with a billion holes in it.

188
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And there I am. I'm done. There's my little Furby.

189
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
No, it's a little robot on heroin or something, I think.

190
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Laughter)

191
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So right now, you see, I love little robots.

192
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So my wife says, "Well, you may like it, but nobody else will."

193
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So she comes to the rescue.

194
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
This is my wife Christi, who is just, you know,

195
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
my muse and my partner for eternity here.

196
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And she does drawings, right?

197
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
She's an actual, you know, artist.

198
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And she starts doing all these different drawings

199
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and does color patterns and coloring books.

200
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And I like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there.

201
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
He didn't test so well, but I like him.

202
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And then she started doing these other images.

203
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
At that time, Beanie Babies was a big hit,

204
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and we thought, we'll do a bunch of different ones.

205
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So here's a little pink one, a little pouf on his head.

206
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And here's -- this didn't do so well in testing either, I don't know why.

207
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
There's my favorite, Demon Furby.

208
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
That was a good one.

209
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Anyway, finally settled on kind of this kind of a look,

210
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
little poufy body, a little imaginary character.

211
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And there he is, a little bush baby on -- caught in the headlights there.

212
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I actually went to Toys"R"Us, got a little furry cat,

213
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
ripped it apart and made this.

214
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And since then, every time I come home from Toys"R"Us

215
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
with dolls or something, they disappear from my desk

216
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and they get hidden in the house.

217
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I have three girls and they just, they --

218
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
it's like a rescue animal thing they're going there.

219
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
(Laughter)

220
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So, a little tether coming off,

221
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
it's just a control for the Fur's mouth and his eyes.

222
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It's just a little server control and I made a little video going:

223
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
"Hi, my name's Furby, and I'm good,"

224
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
you know, and then I'd reach my hand.

225
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
He'd -- you can tickle him. When I put my hand up,

226
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
"Ha, ha, ha, ha" and that's how we sold him.

227
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And Hasbro actually said, I meant Tiger Electronics at the time,

228
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
said, "Yeah, we want to do this.

229
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We have, you know, 13 weeks or something to Toy Fair,

230
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and we're going to hire you guys to do this."

231
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And so Dave and I got working.

232
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Mostly me, because it was all mechanics at this point.

233
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So now I have to really figure out all kinds of stuff

234
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I don't know how to do.

235
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And I started working with Solid Works

236
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and a whole other group to do that.

237
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And we started --

238
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
this was way back before there was really much SLA going on,

239
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
not a lot of rapid prototyping.

240
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
We certainly didn't have the money to do this.

241
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
They only paid me, like, a little bit of money to do this,

242
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
so I had to call a friend of a friend

243
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
who was running the GM prototype plant, SLA plant, that was down.

244
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And they said, "Yeah, well, we'll run them."

245
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So they ran all the shells for us, which was nice of them.

246
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And the cams I got cut at Hewlett Packard.

247
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
We snuck in on the weekend.

248
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And so we just had a disc of the files.

249
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
But they have a closed system, so you couldn't print the things out on the machine.

250
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So we actually printed them out on clear and taped them on the monitors.

251
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And on the weekend we ran the parts for that.

252
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So this is how they come out close to the end.

253
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And then they looked like little Garfields there.

254
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Eight months later -- you may remember this,

255
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
this was a -- total, total, total chaos.

256
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
For a while, they were making two million Furbys a month.

257
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
They actually wound up doing about 40 million Furbys.

258
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I -- it's unbelievable how -- I don't know how that can be.

259
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And Hasbro made about, you know, a billion and a half dollars.

260
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And I just a little bit on each one.

261
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
So full circle -- why do I do this?

262
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Why do you, you know, try to do this stuff?

263
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And it's, of course, for your kids.

264
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And there's my youngest daughter with her Furbys.

265
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And she still actually has those.

266
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So I kind of retired, and we're already living in paradise

267
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
up in Boise, on a river, you know. So

268
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and then I started another company called Toy Innovation

269
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and we did some projects with Mattel with

270
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
actually with a lady who's here, Ivy Ross,

271
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and we did Miracle Moves Baby,

272
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
made it in Wired magazine, did a bunch of other stuff.

273
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And then I started another company.

274
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
We did a little hand-held device for teens that could hook up to the Internet,

275
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
won "Best Innovations" at CES,

276
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
but really I kind of slowed down and said, OK,

277
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I just ... After a while, I had this old tape of this dinosaur,

278
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and I gave it to this guy, and this other guy saw it,

279
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and then people started to want to do it.

280
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And they said they'd spend all this time.

281
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
So I said, "OK, let's try to do this dinosaur project."

282
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
The crazy idea is we're going to try to clone a dinosaur

283
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
as much as we can with today's technology.

284
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And it's not really -- but as close as we can do.

285
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And we're going to try to really pull this off,

286
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
intentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive.

287
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Not a robot that kind of does, but let's really go for it.

288
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So I picked a Camarasaurus,

289
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
because the Camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in North America.

290
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And you could actually find full fossil evidence of these.

291
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
That's a juvenile.

292
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And so we actually went in.

293
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
There's a book called "Walking on Eggshells,"

294
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
where they found actual sauropod skin in Patagonia.

295
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And the picture from the book, so when I --

296
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
I told the sculptor to use this bump pattern, whatever you can to copy that.

297
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Very, very obsessive.

298
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
There's a kind of truncated Camarasaurus skeleton,

299
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
but the geometry's correct.

300
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And then I went in, and measured all the geometry

301
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
because I figured, hey, biomimicry.

302
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
If I do it kind of right, it might move kind of like the real thing.

303
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So there's the motor.

304
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And about this time, you know, all these other people are starting to help.

305
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Here's an example of what we did with the skull.

306
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
There's the skull, there's my drawing of a skull.

307
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
There's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue.

308
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
There's the mechanism that would go in there,

309
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
kind of a Geneva drive.

310
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
There's some Solid Works versions of it.

311
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Here's some SLA parts of the same thing.

312
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And then, these are really crude pieces. We were just doing some tests here.

313
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
There's the skull, pretty much the same shape as the Camarasaurus.

314
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
There's a photorealistic eye behind a lens.

315
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And there's kind of the first exploded view, or see-through view.

316
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
There's the first SLA version, and it already kind of has the feel,

317
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
it has kind of a cuteness already.

318
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And the thing about blending science and art

319
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
in this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot,

320
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and then you go back and do the shape,

321
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and then you go back and forth.

322
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
The servos in the front legs, we had to shape those like muscles.

323
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
They had to fit within the envelope.

324
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
There was a tremendous amount of work to get all that working right.

325
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
All the neck and the tail are cable,

326
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
so it moves smoothly and organically.

327
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And then, of course, you're not done yet.

328
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
You have to get the look for the skin.

329
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
The skin's a whole another thing, probably the hardest part.

330
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
So you hire artists, and you try to get the look and feel

331
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
of the character.

332
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Now, this is not -- we're character designers, right?

333
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And we're still trying to keep with the real character.

334
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
So, now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay.

335
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Now you start doing the sculpture for this.

336
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And you can see we got a guy from --

337
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
who's just a fanatic about dinosaurs

338
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
to do the sculpting for us,

339
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
down to the spoon-shaped teeth and everything.

340
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And then more sculpting, and then more sculpting,

341
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and then more sculpting, and then more sculpting.

342
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And then, four years and 10 million dollars later,

343
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
we have a little Pleo.

344
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
John, do you want to bring him up?

345
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
John Sosoka is our CTO, and is really the man

346
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
that's done most of the work with our 40-person company.

347
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
I'd like to give John a hand. He never gets recognition. This is John Sosoka.

348
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
(Applause)

349
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
So, thank you, John, thank you,

350
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and get back to work, all right, man?

351
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
All right --

352
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
(Laughter)

353
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
-- no, it's very painful, so --

354
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
(Laughter)

355
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
-- these are little Pleos and you can probably see them.

356
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
This -- I on purpose -- they go through life stages.

357
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
So when you first get them, they're babies.

358
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
And you -- more you have them, kind of the older they get,

359
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and they kind of learn through their behavior.

360
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
So this one, this one's actually asleep, and -- hang on.

361
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Pleo, wake up. Pleo, come on.

362
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
So this guy's listening to my voice here.

363
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
But they have 40 sensors all over their body.

364
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
They have seven processors, they have 14 motors,

365
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
they have --

366
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
but you don't care, do you?

367
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
They're just cute, right? That's the idea, that's the idea.

368
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
So you see -- hey, come on. Hey, did you feel that?

369
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
There's something big and loud over here.

370
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
Hey.

371
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
(Laughter)

372
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
That's good, wake up, wake up, wake up.

373
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Yeah, they're like kids, you know.

374
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
You, yeah, yeah. Okay, he's hungry.

375
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
I'll show you what he's been doing for, for four years.

376
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Here, here, here. Have some money, Pleo.

377
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
(Laughter)

378
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
There you go.

379
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
That's what the investors think, that it's just --

380
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
(Laughter)

381
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
-- right, right. So they're really sweet little guys.

382
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
And we're hoping that -- you know,

383
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
our belief is that humans need to feel empathy towards things

384
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
in order to be more human.

385
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And we think we can help that out by having

386
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
little creatures that you can love.

387
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Now these are not robots, they're kind of lovebots, you know.

388
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
They do change over time.

389
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
But mostly they evoke a feeling of caring.

390
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And we have a -- I have a little something here.

391
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Now I do want to say that, you know, Ugobe is not there yet.

392
0:17:01.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
We've just opened the door, and it's for all of you to step through it.

393
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
We did include some things that are hopefully useful.

394
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Excuse me, Pleo.

395
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
They -- he has a USB and he has a SD card,

396
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
so it's completely open architecture.

397
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
So anyone can plug him -- (Applause) -- thank you.

398
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
This is John over here.

399
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Anyone can take Pleo and they can totally redo his personality.

400
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
You can make him bipolar, or as someone said, a --

401
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:23,000
(Laughter) --

402
0:17:23.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
you can change his homeostatic drives, or whatever you want to call them.

403
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Kids can just drag and drop, put in new sounds.

404
0:17:32.16,000 --> 0:17:35,000
We -- actually, it's very hard to keep people from doing this.

405
0:17:35.16,000 --> 0:17:38,000
We have one animator who's taken it and

406
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
he's done a take on the Budweiser beer commercial,

407
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
and they're going, "Whassup," you know?

408
0:17:43.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
(Laughter)

409
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
You -- so it's -- yes, he likes that.

410
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:51,000
So they're a handful. We hope you get one.

411
0:17:51.16,000 --> 0:17:53,000
I don't know what I'm missing to say,

412
0:17:53.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
but as a last thing, I'd like to say is that

413
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:18:02,000
if we continue along this path, we are designing our children's best friends.

414
0:18:02.16,000 --> 0:18:04,000
And there's a lot of social responsibility in that.

415
0:18:04.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
That's why Pleo's soft and gentle and loving.

416
0:18:06.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
And so I just -- I hope we all dream well.

417
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Thank you.

418
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
(Applause)

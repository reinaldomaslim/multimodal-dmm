1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
The future of life, where the unraveling of our biology --

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and bring up the lights a little bit. I don't have any slides.

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm just going to talk --

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
about where that's likely to carry us.

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And you know, I saw all the visions

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
of the first couple of sessions.

7
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It almost made me feel a little bit guilty about having an uplifting talk

8
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
about the future.

9
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It felt wrong to do that in some way.

10
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And yet, I don't really think it is

11
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
because when it comes down to it,

12
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
it's this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain --

13
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
what people in the future are going to remember about this period.

14
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I want to talk to you a little bit about

15
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
why the visions of Jeremy Rivkins,

16
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
who would like to ban these sorts of technologies,

17
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
or of the Bill Joys who would like to relinquish them,

18
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
are actually -- to follow those paths would be such a tragedy for us.

19
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I'm focusing on biology,

20
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the biological sciences.

21
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The reason I'm doing that is because those are going to be

22
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
the areas that are the most significant to us.

23
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
The reason for that is really very simple.

24
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It's because we're flesh and blood.

25
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We're biological creatures.

26
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And what we can do with our biology

27
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
is going to shape our future

28
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and that of our children and that of their children --

29
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
whether we gain control over aging,

30
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
whether we learn to protect ourselves from Alzheimer's,

31
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and heart disease, and cancer.

32
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I think that Shakespeare really put it very nicely.

33
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And I'm actually going to use his words in the same order that he did.

34
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
He said, "And so from hour to hour

36
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
we ripe and ripe.

37
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And then from hour to hour we rot and rot.

38
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And thereby hangs a tale."

39
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Life is short, you know.

40
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And we need to think about planning a little bit.

41
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
We're all going to eventually, even in the developed world,

42
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
going to have to lose everything that we love.

43
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
When you're beginning to rot a little bit,

44
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
all of the videos crammed into your head,

45
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
all of the extensions that extend your various powers,

46
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
are going to being to seem a little secondary.

47
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And you know, I'm getting a little bit gray -- so is Ray Kurzweil,

48
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
so is Eric Drexler.

49
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
This is where it's really central to our lives.

50
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Now I know there's been a whole lot of hype

51
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
about our power to control biology.

52
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
You just have to look at the Human Genome Project.

53
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It wasn't two years ago

54
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that everybody was talking about --

55
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
we've found the Holy Grail of biology.

56
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We're deciphering the code of codes.

57
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We're reading the book of life.

58
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It's a little bit reminiscent of 1969 when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon,

59
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and everybody was about to race out toward the stars.

60
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And we've all seen "2001: A Space Odyssey."

61
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
You know it's 2003, and there is no HAL.

62
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And there is no odyssey to our own moon, much less the moons of Jupiter.

63
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And we're still picking up pieces of the Challenger.

64
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So it's not surprising that some people would wonder

65
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
whether maybe 30 or 40 years from now,

66
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
we'll look back at this instant in time,

67
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and all of the sort of talk about

68
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
the Human Genome Project,

69
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and what all this is going to mean to us --

70
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
well, it will really mean precious little.

71
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And I just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case.

72
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Because when we talk about our genetics and our biology,

73
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and modifying and altering and adjusting these things,

74
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
we're talking about changing ourselves.

75
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And this is very critical stuff.

76
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
If you have any doubts about how technology affects our lives,

77
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
you just have to go to any major city.

78
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
This is not the stomping ground

79
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
of our Pleistocene ancestors.

80
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
What's happening is we're taking this technology --

81
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
it's becoming more precise, more potent --

82
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and we're turning it back upon ourselves.

83
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Before it's all done

84
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
we are going to alter ourselves

85
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
every bit as much as we have changed the world around us.

86
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It's going to happen a lot sooner

87
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
than people imagine.

88
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
On the way there it's going to

89
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
completely revolutionize medicine and health care; that's obvious.

90
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It's going to change the way we have children.

91
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It's going to change the way we manage

92
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and alter our emotions.

93
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It's going to probably change the human lifespan.

94
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It will really make us question

95
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
what it is to be a human being.

96
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
The larger context of this is that are

97
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
two unprecedented revolutions that are going on today.

98
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The first of them is the obvious one,

99
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
the silicon revolution,

100
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
which you all are very, very familiar with.

101
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It's changing our lives in so many ways,

102
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and it will continue to do that.

103
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
What the essence of that is, is that we're taking

104
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
the sand at our feet, the inert silicon at our feet,

105
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and we're breathing a level of complexity into it

106
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that rivals that of life itself,

107
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and may even surpass it.

108
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
As an outgrowth of that, as a child of that revolution,

109
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
is the revolution in biology.

110
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
The genomics revolution,

111
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
proteomics, metabolomics, all of these "omics"

112
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that sound so terrific on grants and on business plans.

113
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
What we're doing is we are

114
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
seizing control of our evolutionary future.

115
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I mean we're essentially using technology

116
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to just jam evolution into fast-forward.

117
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It's not at all clear where it's going to take us.

118
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
But in five to ten years we're going to start see

119
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
some very profound changes.

120
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
The most immediate changes that we'll see

121
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
are things like in medicine.

122
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
There is going to be a big shift towards preventative medicine

123
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
as we start to be able to identify

124
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
all of the risk factors that we have as individuals.

125
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
But who is going to pay for all this?

126
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And how are we going to understand all this complex information?

127
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
That is going to be the IT challenge

128
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
of the next generation, is communicating all this information.

129
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
There's pharmacogenomics, the combination of pharmacology

130
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and genetics:

131
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
tailoring drugs to our individual constitutions

132
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that Juan talked about a little bit earlier.

133
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
That's going to have amazing impacts.

134
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And it's going to be used for diet as well,

135
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and nutritional supplements and such.

136
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But it's going to have a big impact because

137
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
we're going to have niche drugs.

138
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And we aren't going to be able to support

139
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
the kinds of expenses that we have to create blockbuster drugs today.

140
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
The approval process is going to fall apart, actually.

141
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
It's too slow.

142
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
It's too risk-averse.

143
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And it is really not suited for the future

144
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that we're moving into.

145
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Another thing is that we're just going to have to deal with this knowledge.

146
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It's really wonderful when we hear,

147
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
"Oh, 99.9 percent of the letters in the code are the same.

148
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We're all identical to each other. Isn't it wonderful?"

149
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And look around you and know

150
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that what we really care about is

151
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that little bit of difference.

152
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
We look the same to a visitor from another planet, maybe,

153
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
but not to each other

154
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
because we compete with each other all time.

155
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And we're going to have to come to grips with the fact

156
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that there are differences between us as individuals that we will know about,

157
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and between subpopulations of humans as well.

158
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
To deny that that's the case is not a very good start on that.

159
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
A generation or so away

160
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
there are going to be even more profound things that are going to happen.

161
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
That's when we're going to begin to use this knowledge to modify ourselves.

162
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Now I don't mean extra gills or something --

163
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
something we care about, like aging.

164
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
What if we could unravel aging and understand it --

165
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
begin to retard the process or even reverse it?

166
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It would change absolutely everything.

167
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And it's obvious to anyone,

168
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that if we can do this, we absolutely will do this,

169
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
whatever the consequences are.

170
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
The second is modifying our emotions.

171
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I mean Ritalin, Viagra,

172
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
things of that sort, Prozac.

173
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
You know, this is just clumsy little baby steps.

174
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
What if you could take a little

175
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
concoction of pharmaceuticals

176
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that would make you feel really contented,

177
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
just happy to be you.

178
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Are you going to be able to resist that if it doesn't have any overt side effects?

179
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Probably not.

180
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And if you don't, who are you going to be?

181
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Why do you do what you do?

182
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
We're sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior.

183
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It's going to be very challenging to deal with.

184
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
The third area is reproduction.

185
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The idea that we're going to chose our children's genes,

186
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
as we begin to understand what genes say about who we are.

187
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
That's the focus of my book "Redesigning Humans,"

188
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
where I talk about the kinds of choices we'll make,

189
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and the challenges it's going to present to society.

190
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
There are three obvious ways of doing this.

191
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
The first is cloning.

192
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
It didn't happen.

193
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
It's a total media circus.

194
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It will happen in five to 10 years.

195
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And when it does it's not going to be that big a deal.

196
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
The birth of a delayed identical twin

197
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
is not going to shake western civilization.

198
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
But there are more important things that are already occurring:

199
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
embryo screening.

200
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
You take a six to eight cell embryo,

201
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
you tease out one of the cells, you run a genetic test on that cell,

202
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and depending on the results of that test

203
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
you either implant that embryo or you discard it.

204
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
It's already done to avoid rare diseases today.

205
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And pretty soon it's going to be possible

206
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way.

207
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
As that becomes possible

208
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
this is going to move from something that is used by those who

209
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
have infertility problems and are already doing in vitro fertilization,

210
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to the wealthy who want to protect their children,

211
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to just about everybody else.

212
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And in that process that's going to morph

213
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
from being just for diseases,

214
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
to being for lesser vulnerabilities,

215
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
like risk of manic depression or something,

216
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to picking personalities,

217
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
temperaments, traits, these sorts of things.

218
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Of course there is going to be genetic engineering.

219
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Directly going in -- it's a little bit further away, but not that far away --

220
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
going in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo.

221
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
The way I suspect it will happen

222
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
is using artificial chromosomes

223
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and extra chromosomes, so we go from 46

224
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
to 47 or 48.

225
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And one that is not heritable

226
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
because who would want to pass on to their children

227
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
the archaic enhancement modules

228
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that they got 25 years earlier from their parents?

229
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
It's a joke; of course they wouldn't want to do that.

230
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
They'll want the new release.

231
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Those kinds of loose analogies with

232
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
(Laughter)

233
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
computers, and with programming,

234
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
are actually much deeper than that.

235
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
They are really going to come to operate in this realm.

236
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Now not everything that can be done should be done.

237
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And it won't be done.

238
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
But when something is feasible in thousands of

239
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
laboratories all over the world,

240
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
which is going to be the case with these technologies,

241
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial,

242
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
which is already the case,

243
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and when they're almost impossible to police,

244
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
it's not a question of if this is going to happen,

245
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
it's when and where and how it's going to happen.

246
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Humanity is going to go down this path.

247
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And it's going to do so for two reasons.

248
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The first is that all these technologies

249
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
are just a spin-off of mainstream medical research

250
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that everybody wants to see happen.

251
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
It is being funded very very --

252
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
in a big way.

253
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
The second is, we're human.

254
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
That's what we do.

255
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
We try and use our technology to

256
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
improve our lives in one way or another.

257
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
To imagine that we're not going to use these technologies

258
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
when they become available,

259
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
is as much a denial of who we are

260
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
as to imagine

261
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that we'll use these technologies and not fret

262
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and worry about it a great deal.

263
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
The lines are going to blur. And they already are

264
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
between therapy and enhancement,

265
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
between treatment and prevention,

266
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
between need and desire.

267
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
That's really the central one, I believe.

268
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
People can try and ban these things.

269
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
They undoubtedly will. They have.

270
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But ultimately all this is going to do

271
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
is just shift development elsewhere.

272
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
It's going to drive these things from view.

273
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
It's going to reserve the technology for the wealthy

274
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
because they are in the best position

275
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
to circumvent any of these sorts of laws.

276
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And it's going to deny us

277
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
the information that we need to make wise decisions

278
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
about how to use these technologies.

279
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
So, sure, we need to debate these things.

280
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And I think it's wonderful that we do.

281
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
But we shouldn't kid ourselves

282
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and think that we're going to reach a consensus about these things.

283
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
That is simply not going to happen.

284
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
They touch us too deeply.

285
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
And they depend too much upon history, upon philosophy,

286
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
upon religion, upon culture, upon politics.

287
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Some people are going to see this

288
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
as an abomination,

289
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
as the worst thing, as just awful.

290
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Other people are going to say, "This is great.

291
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
This is the flowering of human endeavor."

292
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
The one thing though that is really dangerous

293
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
about these sorts of technologies,

294
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
is that it's easy to become seduced by them.

295
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And to focus too much on all

296
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
the high-technology possibilities that exist.

297
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And to lose touch

298
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
with the basic rhythms of our biology and our health.

299
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
There are too many people that think that high-technology medicine

300
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
is going to keep them, save them,

301
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
from overeating,

302
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
from eating a lot of fast foods,

303
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
from not getting any exercise.

304
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
It's not going to happen.

305
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
In the midst of all this amazing technology,

306
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and all these things that are occurring, it's really interesting

307
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
because there is sort of a counter-revolution that is going on:

308
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
a resurgence of interest in remedies from the past,

309
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
in nutraceuticals, in all of these sorts of things

310
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
that some people, in the pharmaceutical industry particularly,

311
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
like to brand as non-science.

312
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
But this whole effort is generated,

313
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
is driven, by IT as well

314
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
because that is how we're gathering all this information,

315
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and linking it, and integrating it together.

316
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
There is a lot in this rich biota that is going to serve us well.

317
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And that's where about half of our drugs come.

318
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
So we shouldn't dismiss this

319
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
because it's an enormous opportunity to use

320
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
these sorts of results,

321
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
or these random loose trials from the last thousand years

322
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
about what has impacts on our health.

323
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And to use our advanced technologies

324
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
to pull out what is beneficial from this

325
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
sea of noise, basically.

326
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
In fact this isn't just abstract.

327
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I just formed a biotechnology company

328
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
that is using

329
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
this sort of an approach to develop

330
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
therapeutics for Alzheimer's and other diseases of aging,

331
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and we're making some real progress.

332
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
So here we are.

333
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
It's the beginning of a new millennium.

334
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
If you look forward,

335
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
I mean future humans,

336
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
far before the end of this millennium,

337
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
in a few hundred years, they are going to look back at this moment.

338
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And from the beginning of today's sessions

339
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
you'd think that they're going to see this as this horrible

340
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
difficult, painful period

341
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
that we struggled through.

342
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And I don't think that's what's going to happen.

343
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
They're going to do like everybody does. They are going to forget about all that stuff.

344
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time.

345
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
They are going to think about it

346
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
as this glorious instant

347
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
when we laid down

348
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
the very foundations of their lives,

349
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
of their society, of their future.

350
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
You know it's a little bit like a birth.

351
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Where there is this bloody, awful mess happens.

352
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And then what comes out of it? New life.

353
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Actually as was pointed out earlier,

354
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
we forget about all the struggle there was in getting there.

355
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
So to me,

356
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
it's clear that one of the foundations of that future

357
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
is going to be the reworking of our biology.

358
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
It's going to come gradually at first. It's going to pick up speed.

359
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
We're going to make lots of errors.

360
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
That's the way these things work.

361
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
To me it's an incredible privilege

362
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
to be alive now

363
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and to be able to witness this thing.

364
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
It is something that is a unique instant

365
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
in the history of all of life.

366
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
It will always be remembered.

367
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:38,000
And what's extraordinary is that

368
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
we're not just observing this,

369
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
we are the architects of this.

370
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
I think that we should be proud of it.

371
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
What is so difficult and challenging

372
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
is that we are also the objects of these changes.

373
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
It's our health, it's our lives, it's our future, it's our children.

374
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
And that is why they are so very troubling to so many people

375
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
who would pull back in fear.

376
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
I think that our choice

377
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
in the choice of life,

378
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
is not whether we're going to go down this path.

379
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:1,000
We are, definitely.

380
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
It's how we hold it in our hearts.

381
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
It's how we look at it.

382
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
I think Thucydides really spoke to us very clearly

383
0:17:18.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
in 430 B.C. He put it nicely.

384
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
Again, I'll use the words in the same order he did.

385
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
"The bravest are surely those

386
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
who have the clearest vision of what is before them,

387
0:17:32.16,000 --> 0:17:35,000
both glory and danger alike.

388
0:17:35.16,000 --> 0:17:39,000
And yet notwithstanding, they go out and they meet it."

389
0:17:39.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Thank you.

390
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
(Applause)

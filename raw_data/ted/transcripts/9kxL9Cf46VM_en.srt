2
0:00:16.117,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Hello, Doha. Hello!

3
0:00:18.915,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Salaam alaikum.

4
0:00:21.72,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I love coming to Doha. It's such an international place.

5
0:00:26.09,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It feels like the United Nations here.

6
0:00:29.642,000 --> 0:00:32,000
You land at the airport, and you're welcomed by an Indian lady

7
0:00:32.935,000 --> 0:00:35,000
who takes you to Al Maha Services, where you meet a Filipino lady

8
0:00:36.822,000 --> 0:00:38,000
who hands you off to a South African lady

9
0:00:39.06,000 --> 0:00:4,000
who then takes you to a Korean

10
0:00:40.807,000 --> 0:00:42,000
who takes you to a Pakistani guy with the luggage

11
0:00:43.628,000 --> 0:00:45,000
who takes you to the car with a Sri Lankan.

12
0:00:45.666,000 --> 0:00:47,000
You go to the hotel and you check in. There's a Lebanese.

13
0:00:48.5,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Yeah? And then a Swedish guy showed me my room.

14
0:00:51.704,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I said, "Where are the Qataris?"

15
0:00:53.55,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:55.22,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Applause)

17
0:00:58.19,000 --> 0:01:01,000
They said, "No, no, it's too hot. They come out later. They're smart."

18
0:01:01.549,000 --> 0:01:02,000
"They know."

19
0:01:02.724,000 --> 0:01:03,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:04.464,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And of course, it's growing so fast, sometimes there's growing pains.

21
0:01:08.277,000 --> 0:01:1,000
You know, like sometimes you run into people

22
0:01:10.579,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that you think know the city well, but they don't know it that well.

23
0:01:13.864,000 --> 0:01:15,000
My Indian cab driver showed up at the W,

24
0:01:16.46,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and I asked him to take me to the Sheraton,

25
0:01:18.751,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and he said, "No problem, sir."

26
0:01:21.278,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And then we sat there for two minutes.

27
0:01:23.365,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I said, "What's wrong?" He said, "One problem, sir."

28
0:01:25.893,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:26.956,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I said, "What?" He goes, "Where is it?"

30
0:01:28.845,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:31.282,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I go, "You're the driver, you should know."

32
0:01:33.345,000 --> 0:01:34,000
He goes, "No, I just arrived, sir."

33
0:01:35.726,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I go, "You just arrived at the W?" "No, I just arrived in Doha, sir."

34
0:01:38.989,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:40.051,000 --> 0:01:41,000
"I was on my way home from the airport,

36
0:01:41.972,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I got a job. I'm working already."

37
0:01:43.623,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:45.138,000 --> 0:01:47,000
He goes, "Sir, why don't you drive?"

39
0:01:47.302,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:48.354,000 --> 0:01:49,000
"I don't know where we're going."

41
0:01:49.958,000 --> 0:01:51,000
"Neither do I. It will be an adventure, sir."

42
0:01:52.086,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Laughter)

43
0:01:54.93,000 --> 0:01:57,000
The Middle East has been an adventure the past couple of years.

44
0:01:58.56,000 --> 0:02:01,000
It is going crazy with the Arab Spring and revolution and all this.

45
0:02:01.735,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Are there any Lebanese here tonight, by applause?

46
0:02:04.137,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Cheering)

47
0:02:05.17,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Lebanese, yeah.

48
0:02:06.346,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The Middle East is going crazy.

49
0:02:07.877,000 --> 0:02:08,000
You know the Middle East is going crazy

50
0:02:09.822,000 --> 0:02:11,000
when Lebanon is the most peaceful place in the region.

51
0:02:12.535,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

52
0:02:15.123,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Who would have thought?

53
0:02:16.543,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:18.06,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Oh my gosh.

55
0:02:20.208,000 --> 0:02:21,000
No, there's serious issues in the region.

56
0:02:22.192,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Some people don't want to talk about them. I'm here to talk about them tonight.

57
0:02:25.938,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Ladies and gentlemen of the Middle East, here's a serious issue.

58
0:02:28.977,000 --> 0:02:3,000
When we see each other, when we say hello,

59
0:02:31.311,000 --> 0:02:32,000
how many kisses are we going to do?

60
0:02:33.084,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Laughter)

61
0:02:34.559,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Every country is different and it's confusing, okay?

62
0:02:37.06,000 --> 0:02:38,000
In Lebanon, they do three.

63
0:02:38.89,000 --> 0:02:39,000
In Egypt, they do two.

64
0:02:40.621,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I was in Lebanon, I got used to three.

65
0:02:43.209,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I went to Egypt. I went to say hello to this one Egyptian guy,

66
0:02:46.529,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I went, one, two. I went for three --

67
0:02:48.401,000 --> 0:02:49,000
He wasn't into it.

68
0:02:49.629,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Laughter)

69
0:02:54.551,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I told him, I said, "No, no, I was just in Lebanon."

70
0:02:57.027,000 --> 0:03:,000
He goes, "I don't care where you were. You just stay where you are, please."

71
0:03:00.655,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

72
0:03:04.265,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I went to Saudi Arabia.

73
0:03:05.642,000 --> 0:03:08,000
In Saudi Arabia, they go one, two, and then they stay on the same side:

74
0:03:09.07,000 --> 0:03:11,000
three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

75
0:03:11.611,000 --> 0:03:13,000
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 --

76
0:03:14.328,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:17.019,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Next time you see a Saudi, look closely.

78
0:03:18.965,000 --> 0:03:19,000
They're just a little bit tilted.

79
0:03:20.659,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:22.377,000 --> 0:03:23,000
"Abdul, are you okay?"

81
0:03:23.575,000 --> 0:03:25,000
"I was saying hello for half an hour. I'll be all right."

82
0:03:26.267,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Laughter)

83
0:03:28.028,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Qataris, you guys do the nose to nose.

84
0:03:31.478,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Why is that? Are you too tired to go all the way around?

85
0:03:34.327,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Laughter)

86
0:03:35.387,000 --> 0:03:38,000
"Habibi, it's so hot. Just come here for a second. Say hello.

87
0:03:38.507,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Hello, Habibi. Just don't move. Just stay there, please.

88
0:03:41.273,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I need to rest."

89
0:03:42.523,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

90
0:03:44.662,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Iranians, sometimes we do two, sometimes we do three.

91
0:03:48.774,000 --> 0:03:51,000
A friend of mine explained to me, before the '79 revolution, it was two.

92
0:03:52.237,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Laughter)

93
0:03:53.298,000 --> 0:03:54,000
After the revolution, three.

94
0:03:55.284,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So with Iranians, you can tell whose side the person is on

95
0:03:58.033,000 --> 0:04:,000
based on the number of kisses they give you.

96
0:04:00.141,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Yeah, if you go one, two, three -- "I can't believe you support this regime!"

97
0:04:03.808,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:04.833,000 --> 0:04:05,000
"With your three kisses."

99
0:04:06.381,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:09.073,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But no, guys, really, it is exciting to be here,

101
0:04:11.578,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and like I said, you guys are doing a lot culturally,

102
0:04:14.457,000 --> 0:04:15,000
you know, and it's amazing,

103
0:04:16.152,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and it helps change the image of the Middle East in the West.

104
0:04:19.037,000 --> 0:04:22,000
A lot of Americans don't know a lot about us, about the Middle East.

105
0:04:22.581,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I'm Iranian and American. I'm there. I know, I've traveled here.

106
0:04:26.044,000 --> 0:04:27,000
There's so much, we laugh, right?

107
0:04:27.78,000 --> 0:04:28,000
People don't know we laugh.

108
0:04:29.167,000 --> 0:04:32,000
When I did the Axis of Evil comedy tour, it came out on Comedy Central,

109
0:04:32.532,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I went online to see what people were saying.

110
0:04:34.664,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I ended up on a conservative website.

111
0:04:36.475,000 --> 0:04:39,000
One guy wrote another guy. He said, "I never knew these people laughed."

112
0:04:40.296,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Think about it. You never see us laughing in American film or television, right?

113
0:04:44.13,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Maybe like an evil laugh: "Wuhahaha."

114
0:04:46.748,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Laughter)

115
0:04:47.823,000 --> 0:04:5,000
"I will kill you in the name of Allah, wuhahahahaha."

116
0:04:50.95,000 --> 0:04:51,000
(Laughter)

117
0:04:52.132,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But never like, "Ha ha ha ha la."

118
0:04:54.057,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

119
0:04:55.808,000 --> 0:04:57,000
We like to laugh. We like to celebrate life.

120
0:04:58.495,000 --> 0:05:,000
And I wish more Americans would travel here.

121
0:05:00.575,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I always encourage my friends:

122
0:05:02.043,000 --> 0:05:03,000
"Travel, see the Middle East,

123
0:05:03.517,000 --> 0:05:05,000
there's so much to see, so many good people."

124
0:05:05.683,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And it's vice versa, and it helps stop problems

125
0:05:07.957,000 --> 0:05:1,000
of misunderstanding and stereotypes from happening.

126
0:05:11.004,000 --> 0:05:13,000
For example, I don't know if you heard about this,

127
0:05:13.382,000 --> 0:05:15,000
a little while ago in the US, there was a Muslim family

128
0:05:16.04,000 --> 0:05:17,000
walking down the aisle of an airplane,

129
0:05:18.055,000 --> 0:05:2,000
talking about the safest place to sit on the plane.

130
0:05:20.75,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Some passengers overheard them,

131
0:05:22.331,000 --> 0:05:25,000
somehow misconstrued that as terrorist talk,

132
0:05:25.601,000 --> 0:05:26,000
got them kicked off the plane.

133
0:05:27.417,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It was a family, a mother, father, child, talking about the seating.

134
0:05:30.727,000 --> 0:05:31,000
As a Middle Eastern male,

135
0:05:32.007,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I know there's certain things I'm not supposed to say

136
0:05:34.777,000 --> 0:05:35,000
on an airplane in the US, right?

137
0:05:36.49,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I'm not supposed to be walking down the aisle,

138
0:05:38.689,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and be like, "Hi, Jack." That's not cool.

139
0:05:40.721,000 --> 0:05:41,000
(Laughter)

140
0:05:42.167,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Even if I'm there with my friend named Jack, I say,

141
0:05:44.62,000 --> 0:05:45,000
"Greetings, Jack. Salutations, Jack."

142
0:05:47.104,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Never "Hi, Jack."

143
0:05:48.323,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Laughter)

144
0:05:51.24,000 --> 0:05:53,000
But now, apparently we can't even talk

145
0:05:53.452,000 --> 0:05:55,000
about the safest place to sit on an airplane.

146
0:05:55.953,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So my advice to all my Middle Eastern friends and Muslim friends

147
0:05:59.062,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and anyone who looks Middle Eastern or Muslim,

148
0:06:01.373,000 --> 0:06:04,000
so to, you know, Indians, and Latinos, everyone, if you're brown --

149
0:06:04.895,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Laughter)

150
0:06:06.607,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Here's my advice to my brown friends.

151
0:06:08.893,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Laughter)

152
0:06:09.97,000 --> 0:06:11,000
The next time you're on an airplane in the US,

153
0:06:12.363,000 --> 0:06:13,000
just speak your mother tongue.

154
0:06:14.392,000 --> 0:06:16,000
That way no one knows what you're saying. Life goes on.

155
0:06:16.994,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Laughter)

156
0:06:18.04,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Granted, some mother tongues might sound a little threatening

157
0:06:20.973,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to the average American.

158
0:06:22.159,000 --> 0:06:24,000
If you're walking down the aisle speaking Arabic,

159
0:06:24.492,000 --> 0:06:25,000
you might freak them out --

160
0:06:25.878,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Imitating Arabic)

161
0:06:28.204,000 --> 0:06:3,000
They might say, "What's he talking about?"

162
0:06:30.283,000 --> 0:06:31,000
The key, to my Arab brothers and sisters,

163
0:06:32.296,000 --> 0:06:34,000
is to throw in random good words to put people at ease

164
0:06:34.86,000 --> 0:06:35,000
as you're walking down the aisle.

165
0:06:36.468,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Just as you're walking down --

166
0:06:37.922,000 --> 0:06:38,000
(Imitating Arabic)

167
0:06:39.291,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Strawberry!

168
0:06:40.493,000 --> 0:06:46,000
(Laughter)

169
0:06:47.676,000 --> 0:06:48,000
(Imitating Arabic)

170
0:06:49.186,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Rainbow!

171
0:06:50.361,000 --> 0:06:51,000
(Laughter)

172
0:06:52.354,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Imitating Arabic)

173
0:06:53.635,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Tutti Frutti!

174
0:06:54.81,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Laughter)

175
0:06:55.944,000 --> 0:06:58,000
"I think he's going to hijack the plane with some ice cream."

176
0:06:59.11,000 --> 0:07:,000
Thank you very much. Have a good night.

177
0:07:01.074,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Thank you, TED.

178
0:07:02.249,000 --> 0:07:05,000
(Cheers) (Applause)

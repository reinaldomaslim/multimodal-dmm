1
0:00:12.69,000 --> 0:00:14,000
It was the spring of 2011,

2
0:00:15.69,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and as they like to say in commencement speeches,

3
0:00:18.516,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I was getting ready to enter the real world.

4
0:00:22.727,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I had recently graduated from college

5
0:00:25.383,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and moved to Paris to start my first job.

6
0:00:28.99,000 --> 0:00:31,000
My dream was to become a war correspondent,

7
0:00:32.886,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but the real world that I found

8
0:00:35.067,000 --> 0:00:39,000
took me into a really different kind of conflict zone.

9
0:00:40.974,000 --> 0:00:42,000
At 22 years old,

10
0:00:43.022,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I was diagnosed with leukemia.

11
0:00:46.927,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The doctors told me and my parents, point-blank,

12
0:00:50.236,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that I had about a 35 percent chance of long-term survival.

13
0:00:56.006,000 --> 0:01:,000
I couldn't wrap my head around what that prognosis meant.

14
0:01:00.847,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But I understood that the reality and the life I'd imagined for myself

15
0:01:05.974,000 --> 0:01:06,000
had shattered.

16
0:01:07.744,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Overnight, I lost my job, my apartment, my independence,

17
0:01:12.774,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and I became patient number 5624.

18
0:01:18.68,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Over the next four years of chemo, a clinical trial

19
0:01:22.253,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and a bone marrow transplant,

20
0:01:24.157,000 --> 0:01:26,000
the hospital became my home,

21
0:01:26.492,000 --> 0:01:28,000
my bed, the place I lived 24/7.

22
0:01:30.111,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Since it was unlikely that I'd ever get better,

23
0:01:33.884,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I had to accept my new reality.

24
0:01:37.276,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And I adapted.

25
0:01:40.196,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I became fluent in medicalese,

26
0:01:43.815,000 --> 0:01:47,000
made friends with a group of other young cancer patients,

27
0:01:48.537,000 --> 0:01:52,000
built a vast collection of neon wigs

28
0:01:52.895,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and learned to use my rolling IV pole as a skateboard.

29
0:01:59.943,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I even achieved my dream of becoming a war correspondent,

30
0:02:03.046,000 --> 0:02:05,000
although not in the way I'd expected.

31
0:02:06.22,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It started with a blog,

32
0:02:07.998,000 --> 0:02:09,000
reporting from the front lines of my hospital bed,

33
0:02:10.359,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and it morphed into a column I wrote for the New York Times,

34
0:02:14.209,000 --> 0:02:15,000
called "Life, Interrupted."

35
0:02:16.784,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But -- (Applause)

36
0:02:17.959,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Thank you.

37
0:02:19.135,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Applause)

38
0:02:21.62,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But above all else,

39
0:02:23.914,000 --> 0:02:26,000
my focus was on surviving.

40
0:02:27.863,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And -- spoiler alert --

41
0:02:30.514,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:32.633,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I did survive, yeah.

43
0:02:34.785,000 --> 0:02:39,000
(Applause)

44
0:02:39.839,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Thanks to an army of supportive humans,

45
0:02:42.728,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I'm not just still here, I am cured of my cancer.

46
0:02:46.921,000 --> 0:02:47,000
(Applause)

47
0:02:48.106,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Thank you.

48
0:02:49.282,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Applause)

49
0:02:51.37,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So, when you go through a traumatic experience like this,

50
0:02:55.527,000 --> 0:02:56,000
people treat you differently.

51
0:02:57.614,000 --> 0:03:01,000
They start telling you how much of an inspiration you are.

52
0:03:02.136,000 --> 0:03:04,000
They say you're a warrior.

53
0:03:04.546,000 --> 0:03:05,000
They call you a hero,

54
0:03:06.514,000 --> 0:03:08,000
someone who's lived the mythical hero's journey,

55
0:03:09.49,000 --> 0:03:11,000
who's endured impossible trials

56
0:03:11.599,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and, against the odds, lived to tell the tale,

57
0:03:14.95,000 --> 0:03:17,000
returning better and braver for what you're been through.

58
0:03:19.839,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And this definitely lines up with my experience.

59
0:03:24.469,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Cancer totally transformed my life.

60
0:03:26.747,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I left the hospital knowing exactly who I was

61
0:03:29.739,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and what I wanted to do in the world.

62
0:03:31.826,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And now, every day as the sun rises,

63
0:03:34.539,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I drink a big glass of celery juice,

64
0:03:37.141,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and I follow this up with 90 minutes of yoga.

65
0:03:40.649,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Then, I write down 50 things I'm grateful for onto a scroll of paper

66
0:03:46.569,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that I fold into an origami crane and send sailing out my window.

67
0:03:51.505,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:53.196,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Are you seriously believing any of this?

69
0:03:56.351,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:58.457,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I don't do any of these things.

71
0:04:00.304,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

72
0:04:01.435,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I hate yoga, and I have no idea how to fold an origami crane.

73
0:04:07.355,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The truth is that for me,

74
0:04:09.461,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the hardest part of my cancer experience began once the cancer was gone.

75
0:04:15.538,000 --> 0:04:18,000
That heroic journey of the survivor we see in movies

76
0:04:19.323,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and watch play out on Instagram --

77
0:04:21.657,000 --> 0:04:22,000
it's a myth.

78
0:04:22.839,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It isn't just untrue, it's dangerous,

79
0:04:25.434,000 --> 0:04:28,000
because it erases the very real challenges of recovery.

80
0:04:29.529,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Now, don't get me wrong -- I am incredibly grateful to be alive,

81
0:04:35.165,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and I am painfully aware that this struggle is a privilege

82
0:04:38.691,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that many don't get to experience.

83
0:04:41.284,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But it's important that I tell you

84
0:04:43.814,000 --> 0:04:48,000
what this projection of heroism and expectation of constant gratitude

85
0:04:49.109,000 --> 0:04:51,000
does to people who are trying to recover.

86
0:04:51.886,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Because being cured is not where the work of healing ends.

87
0:04:56.784,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It's where it begins.

88
0:04:59.704,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I'll never forget the day I was discharged from the hospital,

89
0:05:03.919,000 --> 0:05:05,000
finally done with treatment.

90
0:05:06.997,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Those four years of chemo had taken a toll on my relationship

91
0:05:12.834,000 --> 0:05:13,000
with my longtime boyfriend,

92
0:05:14.744,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and he'd recently moved out.

93
0:05:17.498,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And when I walked into my apartment, it was quiet.

94
0:05:21.831,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Eerily so.

95
0:05:24.192,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The person I wanted to call in this moment,

96
0:05:26.911,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the person who I knew would understand everything,

97
0:05:30.434,000 --> 0:05:31,000
was my friend Melissa.

98
0:05:32.498,000 --> 0:05:34,000
She was a fellow cancer patient,

99
0:05:34.574,000 --> 0:05:36,000
but she had died three weeks earlier.

100
0:05:38.515,000 --> 0:05:4,000
As I stood there in the doorway of my apartment,

101
0:05:41.515,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I wanted to cry.

102
0:05:43.42,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But I was too tired to cry.

103
0:05:46.728,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The adrenaline was gone.

104
0:05:48.601,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I had felt as if the inner scaffolding

105
0:05:51.395,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that had held me together since my diagnosis

106
0:05:53.856,000 --> 0:05:54,000
had suddenly crumbled.

107
0:05:56.173,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I had spent the past 1,500 days working tirelessly to achieve one goal:

108
0:06:03.106,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to survive.

109
0:06:04.511,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And now that I'd done so,

110
0:06:06.44,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I realized I had absolutely no idea how to live.

111
0:06:13.996,000 --> 0:06:15,000
On paper, of course, I was better:

112
0:06:16.06,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I didn't have leukemia,

113
0:06:18.187,000 --> 0:06:19,000
my blood counts were back to normal,

114
0:06:20.064,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and the disability checks soon stopped coming.

115
0:06:23.244,000 --> 0:06:24,000
To the outside world,

116
0:06:24.506,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I clearly didn't belong in the kingdom of the sick anymore.

117
0:06:29.871,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But in reality, I never felt further from being well.

118
0:06:34.688,000 --> 0:06:38,000
All that chemo had taken a permanent physical toll on my body.

119
0:06:39.949,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I wondered, "What kind of job can I hold

120
0:06:43.093,000 --> 0:06:47,000
when I need to nap for four hours in the middle of the day?

121
0:06:47.18,000 --> 0:06:49,000
When my misfiring immune system

122
0:06:49.665,000 --> 0:06:52,000
still sends me to the ER on a regular basis?"

123
0:06:53.657,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And then there were the invisible, psychological imprints

124
0:06:57.515,000 --> 0:06:59,000
my illness had left behind:

125
0:06:59.689,000 --> 0:07:01,000
the fears of relapse,

126
0:07:02.356,000 --> 0:07:03,000
the unprocessed grief,

127
0:07:04.282,000 --> 0:07:09,000
the demons of PTSD that descended upon me for days, sometimes weeks.

128
0:07:10.921,000 --> 0:07:12,000
See, we talk about reentry

129
0:07:13.199,000 --> 0:07:16,000
in the context of war and incarceration.

130
0:07:16.548,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But we don't talk about it as much

131
0:07:18.466,000 --> 0:07:22,000
in the context of other kinds of traumatic experiences, like an illness.

132
0:07:23.911,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Because no one had warned me of the challenges of reentry,

133
0:07:27.839,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I thought something must be wrong with me.

134
0:07:30.64,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I felt ashamed,

135
0:07:32.839,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and with great guilt, I kept reminding myself

136
0:07:36.149,000 --> 0:07:38,000
of how lucky I was to be alive at all,

137
0:07:38.464,000 --> 0:07:4,000
when so many people like my friend Melissa were not.

138
0:07:42.387,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But on most days, I woke up feeling so sad and lost,

139
0:07:46.006,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I could barely breathe.

140
0:07:48.204,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Sometimes, I even fantasized about getting sick again.

141
0:07:53.683,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And let me tell you,

142
0:07:54.859,000 --> 0:07:57,000
there are so many better things to fantasize about

143
0:07:58.787,000 --> 0:08:,000
when you're in your twenties and recently single.

144
0:08:01.533,000 --> 0:08:02,000
(Laughter)

145
0:08:03.479,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But I missed the hospital's ecosystem.

146
0:08:07.399,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Like me, everyone in there was broken.

147
0:08:10.836,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But out here, among the living, I felt like an impostor,

148
0:08:15.232,000 --> 0:08:17,000
overwhelmed and unable to function.

149
0:08:18.692,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I also missed the sense of clarity I'd felt at my sickest.

150
0:08:23.581,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Staring your mortality straight in the eye has a way of simplifying things,

151
0:08:28.67,000 --> 0:08:31,000
of rerouting your focus to what really matters.

152
0:08:32.686,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And when I was sick, I vowed that if I survived,

153
0:08:35.051,000 --> 0:08:36,000
it had to be for something.

154
0:08:36.577,000 --> 0:08:39,000
It had to be to live a good life, an adventurous life,

155
0:08:39.998,000 --> 0:08:4,000
a meaningful one.

156
0:08:41.927,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But the question, once I was cured,

157
0:08:44.41,000 --> 0:08:45,000
became: How?

158
0:08:46.712,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I was 27 years old with no job, no partner, no structure.

159
0:08:51.654,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And this time, I didn't have treatment protocols or discharge instructions

160
0:08:56.045,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to help guide my way forward.

161
0:08:58.773,000 --> 0:09:03,000
But what I did have was an in-box full of internet messages

162
0:09:04.722,000 --> 0:09:05,000
from strangers.

163
0:09:06.895,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Over the years,

164
0:09:08.074,000 --> 0:09:1,000
people from all over the world had read my column,

165
0:09:10.744,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and they'd responded with letters, comments and emails.

166
0:09:16.046,000 --> 0:09:2,000
It was a mix, as is often the case, for writers.

167
0:09:21.773,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I got a lot of unsolicited advice

168
0:09:24.432,000 --> 0:09:27,000
about how to cure my cancer with things like essential oils.

169
0:09:29.281,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I got some questions about my bra size.

170
0:09:32.687,000 --> 0:09:33,000
But mostly --

171
0:09:34.551,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Laughter)

172
0:09:35.678,000 --> 0:09:39,000
mostly, I heard from people who, in their own different way,

173
0:09:40.44,000 --> 0:09:42,000
understood what it was that I was going through.

174
0:09:43.696,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I heard from a teenage girl in Florida

175
0:09:46.561,000 --> 0:09:48,000
who, like me, was coming out of chemo

176
0:09:48.895,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and wrote me a message composed largely of emojis.

177
0:09:53.649,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I heard from a retired art history professor in Ohio named Howard,

178
0:09:59.077,000 --> 0:10:,000
who'd spent most of his life

179
0:10:00.525,000 --> 0:10:03,000
struggling with a mysterious, debilitating health condition

180
0:10:04.004,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that he'd had from the time he was a young man.

181
0:10:07.321,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I heard from an inmate on death row in Texas

182
0:10:12.026,000 --> 0:10:14,000
by the name of Little GQ --

183
0:10:14.514,000 --> 0:10:16,000
short for "Gangster Quinn."

184
0:10:17.442,000 --> 0:10:19,000
He'd never been sick a day in his life.

185
0:10:19.752,000 --> 0:10:22,000
He does 1,000 push-ups to start off each morning.

186
0:10:22.917,000 --> 0:10:24,000
But he related to what I described in one column

187
0:10:25.547,000 --> 0:10:27,000
as my "incanceration,"

188
0:10:27.758,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and to the experience of being confined to a tiny fluorescent room.

189
0:10:33.458,000 --> 0:10:37,000
"I know that our situations are different," he wrote to me,

190
0:10:37.966,000 --> 0:10:41,000
"But the threat of death lurks in both of our shadows."

191
0:10:43.819,000 --> 0:10:47,000
In those lonely first weeks and months of my recovery,

192
0:10:47.986,000 --> 0:10:5,000
these strangers and their words became lifelines,

193
0:10:51.887,000 --> 0:10:53,000
dispatches from people of so many different backgrounds,

194
0:10:54.767,000 --> 0:10:55,000
with so many different experiences,

195
0:10:56.765,000 --> 0:10:58,000
all showing me the same thing:

196
0:11:01.25,000 --> 0:11:03,000
you can be held hostage

197
0:11:03.933,000 --> 0:11:05,000
by the worst thing that's ever happened to you

198
0:11:06.941,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and allow it to hijack your remaining days,

199
0:11:10.371,000 --> 0:11:12,000
or you can find a way forward.

200
0:11:14.96,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I knew I needed to make some kind of change.

201
0:11:18.807,000 --> 0:11:2,000
I wanted to be in motion again

202
0:11:21.722,000 --> 0:11:25,000
to figure out how to unstuck myself and to get back out into the world.

203
0:11:26.918,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And so I decided to go on a real journey --

204
0:11:31.791,000 --> 0:11:34,000
not the bullshit cancer one

205
0:11:35.021,000 --> 0:11:38,000
or the mythical hero's journey that everyone thought I should be on,

206
0:11:38.261,000 --> 0:11:41,000
but a real, pack-your-bags kind of journey.

207
0:11:42.586,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I put everything I owned into storage,

208
0:11:47.621,000 --> 0:11:49,000
rented out my apartment, borrowed a car

209
0:11:50.624,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and talked a very a dear but somewhat smelly friend

210
0:11:55.707,000 --> 0:11:56,000
into joining me.

211
0:11:56.89,000 --> 0:11:58,000
(Laughter)

212
0:11:59.366,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Together, my dog Oscar and I embarked on a 15,000-mile road trip

213
0:12:04.941,000 --> 0:12:05,000
around the United States.

214
0:12:07.175,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Along the way, we visited some of those strangers who'd written to me.

215
0:12:12.826,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I needed their advice,

216
0:12:14.405,000 --> 0:12:16,000
also to say to them, thank you.

217
0:12:17.276,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I went to Ohio and stayed with Howard, the retired professor.

218
0:12:23.085,000 --> 0:12:26,000
When you've suffered a loss or a trauma,

219
0:12:26.25,000 --> 0:12:28,000
the impulse can be to guard your heart.

220
0:12:29.069,000 --> 0:12:33,000
But Howard urged me to open myself up to uncertainty,

221
0:12:33.324,000 --> 0:12:37,000
to the possibilities of new love, new loss.

222
0:12:38.561,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Howard will never be cured of illness.

223
0:12:41.395,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And as a young man, he had no way of predicting how long he'd live.

224
0:12:44.665,000 --> 0:12:46,000
But that didn't stop him from getting married.

225
0:12:47.839,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Howard has grandkids now,

226
0:12:49.807,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and takes weekly ballroom dancing lessons with his wife.

227
0:12:53.807,000 --> 0:12:54,000
When I visited them,

228
0:12:55.149,000 --> 0:12:58,000
they’d recently celebrated their 50th anniversary.

229
0:12:59.815,000 --> 0:13:01,000
In his letter to me, he'd written,

230
0:13:02.347,000 --> 0:13:04,000
"Meaning is not found in the material realm;

231
0:13:05.276,000 --> 0:13:09,000
it's not in dinner, jazz, cocktails or conversation.

232
0:13:09.387,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Meaning is what's left when everything else is stripped away."

233
0:13:14.753,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I went to Texas, and I visited Little GQ on death row.

234
0:13:19.999,000 --> 0:13:22,000
He asked me what I did to pass all that time

235
0:13:23.376,000 --> 0:13:25,000
I'd spent in a hospital room.

236
0:13:26.355,000 --> 0:13:3,000
When I told him that I got really, really good at Scrabble,

237
0:13:30.609,000 --> 0:13:33,000
he said, "Me, too!" and explained how,

238
0:13:34.059,000 --> 0:13:37,000
even though he spends most of his days in solitary confinement,

239
0:13:37.422,000 --> 0:13:41,000
he and his neighboring prisoners make board games out of paper

240
0:13:41.451,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and call out their plays through their meal slots --

241
0:13:45.474,000 --> 0:13:5,000
a testament to the incredible tenacity of the human spirit

242
0:13:51.403,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and our ability to adapt with creativity.

243
0:13:56.426,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And my last stop was in Florida,

244
0:13:58.386,000 --> 0:14:01,000
to see that teenage girl who'd sent me all those emojis.

245
0:14:02.585,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Her name is Unique, which is perfect,

246
0:14:05.751,000 --> 0:14:09,000
because she's the most luminous, curious person I've ever met.

247
0:14:10.831,000 --> 0:14:12,000
I asked her what she wants to do next and she said,

248
0:14:13.785,000 --> 0:14:14,000
"I want to go to college and travel

249
0:14:15.698,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and eat weird foods like octopus that I've never tasted before

250
0:14:18.855,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and come visit you in New York

251
0:14:20.399,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and go camping, but I'm scared of bugs,

252
0:14:22.327,000 --> 0:14:23,000
but I still want to go camping."

253
0:14:25.768,000 --> 0:14:27,000
I was in awe of her,

254
0:14:28.22,000 --> 0:14:33,000
that she could be so optimistic and so full of plans for the future,

255
0:14:33.514,000 --> 0:14:34,000
given everything she'd been through.

256
0:14:36.18,000 --> 0:14:37,000
But as Unique showed me,

257
0:14:37.879,000 --> 0:14:41,000
it is far more radical and dangerous to have hope

258
0:14:42.76,000 --> 0:14:44,000
than to live hemmed in by fear.

259
0:14:46.699,000 --> 0:14:5,000
But the most important thing I learned on that road trip

260
0:14:51.104,000 --> 0:14:55,000
is that the divide between the sick and the well --

261
0:14:55.307,000 --> 0:14:56,000
it doesn't exist.

262
0:14:57.149,000 --> 0:14:59,000
The border is porous.

263
0:14:59.585,000 --> 0:15:01,000
As we live longer and longer,

264
0:15:01.974,000 --> 0:15:04,000
surviving illnesses and injuries that would have killed our grandparents,

265
0:15:05.855,000 --> 0:15:06,000
even our parents,

266
0:15:07.204,000 --> 0:15:11,000
the vast majority of us will travel back and forth between these realms,

267
0:15:11.956,000 --> 0:15:14,000
spending much of our lives somewhere between the two.

268
0:15:16.059,000 --> 0:15:19,000
These are the terms of our existence.

269
0:15:20.228,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Now, I wish I could say that since coming home from my road trip,

270
0:15:24.45,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I feel fully healed.

271
0:15:26.601,000 --> 0:15:27,000
I don't.

272
0:15:28.601,000 --> 0:15:3,000
But once I stopped expecting myself

273
0:15:31.251,000 --> 0:15:34,000
to return to the person I'd been pre-diagnosis,

274
0:15:35.253,000 --> 0:15:4,000
once I learned to accept my body and its limitations,

275
0:15:40.381,000 --> 0:15:42,000
I actually did start to feel better.

276
0:15:43.405,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And in the end, I think that's the trick:

277
0:15:47.278,000 --> 0:15:5,000
to stop seeing our health as binary,

278
0:15:50.822,000 --> 0:15:51,000
between sick and healthy,

279
0:15:52.533,000 --> 0:15:53,000
well and unwell,

280
0:15:54.06,000 --> 0:15:55,000
whole and broken;

281
0:15:55.782,000 --> 0:15:59,000
to stop thinking that there's some beautiful, perfect state of wellness

282
0:16:00.246,000 --> 0:16:01,000
to strive for;

283
0:16:01.812,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and to quit living in a state of constant dissatisfaction

284
0:16:05.719,000 --> 0:16:06,000
until we reach it.

285
0:16:08.605,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Every single one of us will have our life interrupted,

286
0:16:14.368,000 --> 0:16:16,000
whether it's by the rip cord of a diagnosis

287
0:16:16.598,000 --> 0:16:2,000
or some other kind of heartbreak or trauma that brings us to the floor.

288
0:16:22.384,000 --> 0:16:27,000
We need to find ways to live in the in-between place,

289
0:16:27.546,000 --> 0:16:31,000
managing whatever body and mind we currently have.

290
0:16:32.776,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Sometimes, all it takes is the ingenuity of a handmade game of Scrabble

291
0:16:39.43,000 --> 0:16:43,000
or finding that stripped-down kind of meaning in the love of family

292
0:16:43.676,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and a night on the ballroom dance floor,

293
0:16:46.292,000 --> 0:16:48,000
or that radical, dangerous hope

294
0:16:49.236,000 --> 0:16:53,000
that I'm guessing will someday lead a teenage girl terrified of bugs

295
0:16:53.381,000 --> 0:16:54,000
to go camping.

296
0:16:55.832,000 --> 0:16:56,000
If you're able to do that,

297
0:16:57.721,000 --> 0:17:,000
then you've taken the real hero's journey.

298
0:17:01.665,000 --> 0:17:05,000
You've achieved what it means to actually be well,

299
0:17:06.069,000 --> 0:17:12,000
which is to say: alive, in the messiest, richest, most whole sense.

300
0:17:13.173,000 --> 0:17:14,000
Thank you, that's all I've got.

301
0:17:14.947,000 --> 0:17:16,000
(Applause)

302
0:17:17.733,000 --> 0:17:18,000
Thank you.

303
0:17:18.913,000 --> 0:17:21,000
(Applause)

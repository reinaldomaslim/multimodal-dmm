1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm a neuroscientist.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And in neuroscience,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
we have to deal with many difficult questions about the brain.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But I want to start with the easiest question

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and the question you really should have all asked yourselves at some point in your life,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
because it's a fundamental question

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
if we want to understand brain function.

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And that is, why do we and other animals

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
have brains?

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Not all species on our planet have brains,

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
so if we want to know what the brain is for,

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
let's think about why we evolved one.

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Now you may reason that we have one

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
to perceive the world or to think,

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and that's completely wrong.

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
If you think about this question for any length of time,

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
it's blindingly obvious why we have a brain.

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
We have a brain for one reason and one reason only,

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and that's to produce adaptable and complex movements.

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
There is no other reason to have a brain.

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Think about it.

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Movement is the only way you have

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
of affecting the world around you.

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Now that's not quite true. There's one other way, and that's through sweating.

25
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But apart from that,

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
everything else goes through contractions of muscles.

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
So think about communication --

28
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
speech, gestures, writing, sign language --

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
they're all mediated through contractions of your muscles.

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So it's really important to remember

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that sensory, memory and cognitive processes are all important,

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
but they're only important

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to either drive or suppress future movements.

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
There can be no evolutionary advantage

35
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to laying down memories of childhood

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
or perceiving the color of a rose

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
if it doesn't affect the way you're going to move later in life.

38
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Now for those who don't believe this argument,

39
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
we have trees and grass on our planet without the brain,

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
but the clinching evidence is this animal here --

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
the humble sea squirt.

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Rudimentary animal, has a nervous system,

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
swims around in the ocean in its juvenile life.

44
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And at some point of its life,

45
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
it implants on a rock.

46
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And the first thing it does in implanting on that rock, which it never leaves,

47
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
is to digest its own brain and nervous system

48
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
for food.

49
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So once you don't need to move,

50
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
you don't need the luxury of that brain.

51
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And this animal is often taken

52
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
as an analogy to what happens at universities

53
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
when professors get tenure,

54
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but that's a different subject.

55
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Applause)

56
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So I am a movement chauvinist.

57
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I believe movement is the most important function of the brain --

58
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
don't let anyone tell you that it's not true.

59
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Now if movement is so important,

60
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
how well are we doing

61
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
understanding how the brain controls movement?

62
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And the answer is we're doing extremely poorly; it's a very hard problem.

63
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
But we can look at how well we're doing

64
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
by thinking about how well we're doing building machines

65
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
which can do what humans can do.

66
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Think about the game of chess.

67
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
How well are we doing determining what piece to move where?

68
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
If you pit Garry Kasparov here, when he's not in jail,

69
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
against IBM's Deep Blue,

70
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
well the answer is IBM's Deep Blue will occasionally win.

71
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And I think if IBM's Deep Blue played anyone in this room, it would win every time.

72
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
That problem is solved.

73
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
What about the problem

74
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
of picking up a chess piece,

75
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
dexterously manipulating it and putting it back down on the board?

76
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
If you put a five year-old child's dexterity against the best robots of today,

77
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the answer is simple:

78
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the child wins easily.

79
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
There's no competition at all.

80
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Now why is that top problem so easy

81
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and the bottom problem so hard?

82
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
One reason is a very smart five year-old

83
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
could tell you the algorithm for that top problem --

84
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
look at all possible moves to the end of the game

85
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and choose the one that makes you win.

86
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So it's a very simple algorithm.

87
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Now of course there are other moves,

88
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
but with vast computers we approximate

89
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and come close to the optimal solution.

90
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
When it comes to being dexterous,

91
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
it's not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous.

92
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And we'll see you have to both perceive and act on the world,

93
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
which has a lot of problems.

94
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
But let me show you cutting-edge robotics.

95
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Now a lot of robotics is very impressive,

96
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
but manipulation robotics is really just in the dark ages.

97
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So this is the end of a Ph.D. project

98
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
from one of the best robotics institutes.

99
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And the student has trained this robot

100
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to pour this water into a glass.

101
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It's a hard problem because the water sloshes about, but it can do it.

102
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But it doesn't do it with anything like the agility of a human.

103
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Now if you want this robot to do a different task,

104
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that's another three-year Ph.D. program.

105
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
There is no generalization at all

106
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
from one task to another in robotics.

107
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Now we can compare this

108
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
to cutting-edge human performance.

109
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So what I'm going to show you is Emily Fox

110
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
winning the world record for cup stacking.

111
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Now the Americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking.

112
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It's a high school sport

113
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
where you have 12 cups you have to stack and unstack

114
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
against the clock in a prescribed order.

115
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And this is her getting the world record in real time.

116
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Laughter)

117
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Applause)

118
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And she's pretty happy.

119
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that,

120
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and that's what we'd like to know.

121
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
So in my group, what we try to do

122
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
is reverse engineer how humans control movement.

123
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And it sounds like an easy problem.

124
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
You send a command down, it causes muscles to contract.

125
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Your arm or body moves,

126
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and you get sensory feedback from vision, from skin, from muscles and so on.

127
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The trouble is

128
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
these signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be.

129
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So one thing that makes controlling movement difficult

130
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
is, for example, sensory feedback is extremely noisy.

131
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Now by noise, I do not mean sound.

132
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
We use it in the engineering and neuroscience sense

133
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
meaning a random noise corrupting a signal.

134
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio

135
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and you heard "crrcckkk" on the station you wanted to hear,

136
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that was the noise.

137
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
But more generally, this noise is something that corrupts the signal.

138
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So for example, if you put your hand under a table

139
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and try to localize it with your other hand,

140
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
you can be off by several centimeters

141
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
due to the noise in sensory feedback.

142
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Similarly, when you put motor output on movement output,

143
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
it's extremely noisy.

144
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Forget about trying to hit the bull's eye in darts,

145
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
just aim for the same spot over and over again.

146
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
You have a huge spread due to movement variability.

147
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And more than that, the outside world, or task,

148
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
is both ambiguous and variable.

149
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The teapot could be full, it could be empty.

150
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It changes over time.

151
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So we work in a whole sensory movement task soup of noise.

152
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Now this noise is so great

153
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that society places a huge premium

154
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
on those of us who can reduce the consequences of noise.

155
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So if you're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball

156
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
into a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick,

157
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
our society will be willing to reward you

158
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
with hundreds of millions of dollars.

159
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Now what I want to convince you of

160
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
is the brain also goes through a lot of effort

161
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to reduce the negative consequences

162
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
of this sort of noise and variability.

163
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And to do that, I'm going to tell you about a framework

164
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
which is very popular in statistics and machine learning of the last 50 years

165
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
called Bayesian decision theory.

166
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And it's more recently a unifying way

167
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to think about how the brain deals with uncertainty.

168
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And the fundamental idea is you want to make inferences and then take actions.

169
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So let's think about the inference.

170
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
You want to generate beliefs about the world.

171
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So what are beliefs?

172
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Beliefs could be: where are my arms in space?

173
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Am I looking at a cat or a fox?

174
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But we're going to represent beliefs with probabilities.

175
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So we're going to represent a belief

176
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
with a number between zero and one --

177
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
zero meaning I don't believe it at all, one means I'm absolutely certain.

178
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And numbers in between give you the gray levels of uncertainty.

179
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And the key idea to Bayesian inference

180
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
is you have two sources of information

181
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
from which to make your inference.

182
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
You have data,

183
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and data in neuroscience is sensory input.

184
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So I have sensory input, which I can take in to make beliefs.

185
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But there's another source of information, and that's effectively prior knowledge.

186
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
You accumulate knowledge throughout your life in memories.

187
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And the point about Bayesian decision theory

188
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
is it gives you the mathematics

189
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
of the optimal way to combine

190
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
your prior knowledge with your sensory evidence

191
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
to generate new beliefs.

192
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And I've put the formula up there.

193
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I'm not going to explain what that formula is, but it's very beautiful.

194
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And it has real beauty and real explanatory power.

195
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And what it really says, and what you want to estimate,

196
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
is the probability of different beliefs

197
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
given your sensory input.

198
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So let me give you an intuitive example.

199
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Imagine you're learning to play tennis

200
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce

201
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
as it comes over the net towards you.

202
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
There are two sources of information

203
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Bayes' rule tells you.

204
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
There's sensory evidence -- you can use visual information auditory information,

205
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and that might tell you it's going to land in that red spot.

206
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
But you know that your senses are not perfect,

207
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and therefore there's some variability of where it's going to land

208
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
shown by that cloud of red,

209
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
representing numbers between 0.5 and maybe 0.1.

210
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
That information is available in the current shot,

211
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
but there's another source of information

212
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
not available on the current shot,

213
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis,

214
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and that's that the ball doesn't bounce

215
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
with equal probability over the court during the match.

216
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
If you're playing against a very good opponent,

217
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
they may distribute it in that green area,

218
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
which is the prior distribution,

219
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
making it hard for you to return.

220
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Now both these sources of information carry important information.

221
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And what Bayes' rule says

222
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
is that I should multiply the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green

223
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to get the numbers of the yellow, which have the ellipses,

224
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and that's my belief.

225
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So it's the optimal way of combining information.

226
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Now I wouldn't tell you all this if it wasn't that a few years ago,

227
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
we showed this is exactly what people do

228
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
when they learn new movement skills.

229
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And what it means

230
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
is we really are Bayesian inference machines.

231
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
As we go around, we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down,

232
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
but we also learn

233
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is,

234
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and then combine those

235
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
in a real Bayesian way.

236
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Now a key part to the Bayesian is this part of the formula.

237
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And what this part really says

238
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
is I have to predict the probability

239
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
of different sensory feedbacks

240
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
given my beliefs.

241
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So that really means I have to make predictions of the future.

242
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And I want to convince you the brain does make predictions

243
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
of the sensory feedback it's going to get.

244
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And moreover, it profoundly changes your perceptions

245
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
by what you do.

246
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And to do that, I'll tell you

247
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
about how the brain deals with sensory input.

248
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So you send a command out,

249
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
you get sensory feedback back,

250
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and that transformation is governed

251
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
by the physics of your body and your sensory apparatus.

252
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
But you can imagine looking inside the brain.

253
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And here's inside the brain.

254
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
You might have a little predictor, a neural simulator,

255
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
of the physics of your body and your senses.

256
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
So as you send a movement command down,

257
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
you tap a copy of that off

258
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and run it into your neural simulator

259
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to anticipate the sensory consequences of your actions.

260
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So as I shake this ketchup bottle,

261
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row.

262
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And if I've got a good predictor, it predicts the same thing.

263
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Well why would I bother doing that?

264
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I'm going to get the same feedback anyway.

265
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Well there's good reasons.

266
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Imagine, as I shake the ketchup bottle,

267
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
someone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me.

268
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Now I get an extra source of sensory information

269
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
due to that external act.

270
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So I get two sources.

271
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I get you tapping on it, and I get me shaking it,

272
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
but from my senses' point of view,

273
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that is combined together into one source of information.

274
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Now there's good reason to believe

275
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that you would want to be able to distinguish external events from internal events.

276
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Because external events are actually much more behaviorally relevant

277
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
than feeling everything that's going on inside my body.

278
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So one way to reconstruct that

279
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
is to compare the prediction --

280
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
which is only based on your movement commands --

281
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
with the reality.

282
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Any discrepancy should hopefully be external.

283
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
So as I go around the world,

284
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I'm making predictions of what I should get, subtracting them off.

285
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Everything left over is external to me.

286
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
What evidence is there for this?

287
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Well there's one very clear example

288
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
where a sensation generated by myself feels very different

289
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
then if generated by another person.

290
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And so we decided the most obvious place to start

291
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
was with tickling.

292
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
It's been known for a long time, you can't tickle yourself

293
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
as well as other people can.

294
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
But it hasn't really been shown, it's because you have a neural simulator,

295
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
simulating your own body

296
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and subtracting off that sense.

297
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
So we can bring the experiments of the 21st century

298
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
by applying robotic technologies to this problem.

299
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And in effect, what we have is some sort of stick in one hand attached to a robot,

300
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and they're going to move that back and forward.

301
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And then we're going to track that with a computer

302
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and use it to control another robot,

303
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
which is going to tickle their palm with another stick.

304
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And then we're going to ask them to rate a bunch of things

305
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
including ticklishness.

306
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I'll show you just one part of our study.

307
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And here I've taken away the robots,

308
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
but basically people move with their right arm sinusoidally back and forward.

309
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And we replay that to the other hand with a time delay.

310
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Either no time delay,

311
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
in which case light would just tickle your palm,

312
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
or with a time delay of two-tenths of three-tenths of a second.

313
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So the important point here

314
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
is the right hand always does the same things -- sinusoidal movement.

315
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
The left hand always is the same and puts sinusoidal tickle.

316
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
All we're playing with is a tempo causality.

317
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And as we go from naught to 0.1 second,

318
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
it becomes more ticklish.

319
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
As you go from 0.1 to 0.2,

320
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
it becomes more ticklish at the end.

321
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And by 0.2 of a second,

322
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
it's equivalently ticklish

323
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
to the robot that just tickled you without you doing anything.

324
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
So whatever is responsible for this cancellation

325
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
is extremely tightly coupled with tempo causality.

326
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And based on this illustration, we really convinced ourselves in the field

327
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
that the brain's making precise predictions

328
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and subtracting them off from the sensations.

329
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Now I have to admit, these are the worst studies my lab has ever run.

330
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Because the tickle sensation on the palm comes and goes,

331
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
you need large numbers of subjects

332
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
with these stars making them significant.

333
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So we were looking for a much more objective way

334
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
to assess this phenomena.

335
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And in the intervening years I had two daughters.

336
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And one thing you notice about children in backseats of cars on long journeys,

337
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
they get into fights --

338
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
which started with one of them doing something to the other, the other retaliating.

339
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
It quickly escalates.

340
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And children tend to get into fights which escalate in terms of force.

341
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Now when I screamed at my children to stop,

342
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
sometimes they would both say to me

343
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
the other person hit them harder.

344
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Now I happen to know my children don't lie,

345
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
so I thought, as a neuroscientist,

346
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
it was important how I could explain

347
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
how they were telling inconsistent truths.

348
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And we hypothesize based on the tickling study

349
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
that when one child hits another,

350
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
they generate the movement command.

351
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
They predict the sensory consequences and subtract it off.

352
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
So they actually think they've hit the person less hard than they have --

353
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
rather like the tickling.

354
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Whereas the passive recipient

355
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
doesn't make the prediction, feels the full blow.

356
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
So if they retaliate with the same force,

357
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
the first person will think it's been escalated.

358
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
So we decided to test this in the lab.

359
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
(Laughter)

360
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Now we don't work with children, we don't work with hitting,

361
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
but the concept is identical.

362
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
We bring in two adults. We tell them they're going to play a game.

363
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And so here's player one and player two sitting opposite to each other.

364
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And the game is very simple.

365
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
We started with a motor

366
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
with a little lever, a little force transfuser.

367
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And we use this motor to apply force down to player one's fingers

368
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
for three seconds and then it stops.

369
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And that player's been told, remember the experience of that force

370
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and use your other finger

371
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
to apply the same force

372
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
down to the other subject's finger through a force transfuser -- and they do that.

373
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And player two's been told, remember the experience of that force.

374
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Use your other hand to apply the force back down.

375
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And so they take it in turns

376
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
to apply the force they've just experienced back and forward.

377
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
But critically,

378
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
they're briefed about the rules of the game in separate rooms.

379
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
So they don't know the rules the other person's playing by.

380
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And what we've measured

381
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
is the force as a function of terms.

382
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And if we look at what we start with,

383
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
a quarter of a Newton there, a number of turns,

384
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
perfect would be that red line.

385
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And what we see in all pairs of subjects is this --

386
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
a 70 percent escalation in force

387
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
on each go.

388
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
So it really suggests, when you're doing this --

389
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
based on this study and others we've done --

390
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that the brain is canceling the sensory consequences

391
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and underestimating the force it's producing.

392
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
So it re-shows the brain makes predictions

393
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and fundamentally changes the precepts.

394
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
So we've made inferences, we've done predictions,

395
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
now we have to generate actions.

396
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
And what Bayes' rule says is, given my beliefs,

397
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
the action should in some sense be optimal.

398
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
But we've got a problem.

399
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Tasks are symbolic -- I want to drink, I want to dance --

400
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
but the movement system has to contract 600 muscles

401
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
in a particular sequence.

402
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
And there's a big gap

403
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
between the task and the movement system.

404
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
So it could be bridged in infinitely many different ways.

405
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
So think about just a point to point movement.

406
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
I could choose these two paths

407
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
out of an infinite number of paths.

408
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Having chosen a particular path,

409
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
I can hold my hand on that path

410
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
as infinitely many different joint configurations.

411
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And I can hold my arm in a particular joint configuration

412
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
either very stiff or very relaxed.

413
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
So I have a huge amount of choice to make.

414
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Now it turns out, we are extremely stereotypical.

415
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
We all move the same way pretty much.

416
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
And so it turns out we're so stereotypical,

417
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
our brains have got dedicated neural circuitry

418
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
to decode this stereotyping.

419
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
So if I take some dots

420
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and set them in motion with biological motion,

421
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
your brain's circuitry would understand instantly what's going on.

422
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Now this is a bunch of dots moving.

423
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
You will know what this person is doing,

424
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
whether happy, sad, old, young -- a huge amount of information.

425
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
If these dots were cars going on a racing circuit,

426
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
you would have absolutely no idea what's going on.

427
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
So why is it

428
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
that we move the particular ways we do?

429
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Well let's think about what really happens.

430
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Maybe we don't all quite move the same way.

431
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Maybe there's variation in the population.

432
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
And maybe those who move better than others

433
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
have got more chance of getting their children into the next generation.

434
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
So in evolutionary scales, movements get better.

435
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
And perhaps in life, movements get better through learning.

436
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
So what is it about a movement which is good or bad?

437
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Imagine I want to intercept this ball.

438
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Here are two possible paths to that ball.

439
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Well if I choose the left-hand path,

440
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
I can work out the forces required

441
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
in one of my muscles as a function of time.

442
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
But there's noise added to this.

443
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
So what I actually get, based on this lovely, smooth, desired force,

444
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
is a very noisy version.

445
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
So if I pick the same command through many times,

446
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
I will get a different noisy version each time, because noise changes each time.

447
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
So what I can show you here

448
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
is how the variability of the movement will evolve

449
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
if I choose that way.

450
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
If I choose a different way of moving -- on the right for example --

451
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
then I'll have a different command, different noise,

452
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
playing through a noisy system, very complicated.

453
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
All we can be sure of is the variability will be different.

454
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
If I move in this particular way,

455
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
I end up with a smaller variability across many movements.

456
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
So if I have to choose between those two,

457
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
I would choose the right one because it's less variable.

458
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
And the fundamental idea

459
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
is you want to plan your movements

460
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise.

461
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
And one intuition to get

462
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
is actually the amount of noise or variability I show here

463
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
gets bigger as the force gets bigger.

464
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
So you want to avoid big forces as one principle.

465
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
So we've shown that using this,

466
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
we can explain a huge amount of data --

467
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
that exactly people are going about their lives planning movements

468
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
so as to minimize negative consequences of noise.

469
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
So I hope I've convinced you the brain is there

470
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
and evolved to control movement.

471
0:18:24.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
And it's an intellectual challenge to understand how we do that.

472
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
But it's also relevant

473
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
for disease and rehabilitation.

474
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
There are many diseases which effect movement.

475
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
And hopefully if we understand how we control movement,

476
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
we can apply that to robotic technology.

477
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
And finally, I want to remind you,

478
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
when you see animals do what look like very simple tasks,

479
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
the actual complexity of what is going on inside their brain

480
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
is really quite dramatic.

481
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
Thank you very much.

482
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
(Applause)

483
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
Chris Anderson: Quick question for you, Dan.

484
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
So you're a movement -- (DW: Chauvinist.) -- chauvinist.

485
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:05,000
Does that mean that you think that the other things we think our brains are about --

486
0:19:05.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
the dreaming, the yearning, the falling in love and all these things --

487
0:19:08.26,000 --> 0:19:11,000
are a kind of side show, an accident?

488
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
DW: No, no, actually I think they're all important

489
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
to drive the right movement behavior to get reproduction in the end.

490
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:19,000
So I think people who study sensation or memory

491
0:19:19.26,000 --> 0:19:21,000
without realizing why you're laying down memories of childhood.

492
0:19:21.26,000 --> 0:19:24,000
The fact that we forget most of our childhood, for example,

493
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
is probably fine, because it doesn't effect our movements later in life.

494
0:19:27.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
You only need to store things which are really going to effect movement.

495
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:33,000
CA: So you think that people thinking about the brain, and consciousness generally,

496
0:19:33.26,000 --> 0:19:35,000
could get real insight

497
0:19:35.26,000 --> 0:19:37,000
by saying, where does movement play in this game?

498
0:19:37.26,000 --> 0:19:39,000
DW: So people have found out for example

499
0:19:39.26,000 --> 0:19:41,000
that studying vision in the absence of realizing why you have vision

500
0:19:41.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
is a mistake.

501
0:19:43.26,000 --> 0:19:45,000
You have to study vision with the realization

502
0:19:45.26,000 --> 0:19:47,000
of how the movement system is going to use vision.

503
0:19:47.26,000 --> 0:19:49,000
And it uses it very differently once you think about it that way.

504
0:19:49.26,000 --> 0:19:52,000
CA: Well that was quite fascinating. Thank you very much indeed.

505
0:19:52.26,000 --> 0:19:54,000

1
0:00:15.5,000 --> 0:00:2,000
As the highest military commander of the Netherlands,

2
0:00:20.66,000 --> 0:00:23,000
with troops stationed around the world,

3
0:00:23.7,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I'm really honored to be here today.

4
0:00:27.86,000 --> 0:00:31,000
When I look around this TEDxAmsterdam venue,

5
0:00:32.06,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I see a very special audience.

6
0:00:36.22,000 --> 0:00:39,000
You are the reason why I said yes

7
0:00:40.148,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to the invitation to come here today.

8
0:00:44.78,000 --> 0:00:48,000
When I look around, I see people who want to make a contribution.

9
0:00:50.58,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I see people who want to make a better world,

10
0:00:55.3,000 --> 0:00:58,000
by doing groundbreaking scientific work,

11
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
by creating impressive works of art,

12
0:01:02.86,000 --> 0:01:06,000
by writing critical articles or inspiring books,

13
0:01:08.1,000 --> 0:01:1,000
by starting up sustainable businesses.

14
0:01:11.62,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And you all have chosen your own instruments

15
0:01:16.02,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to fulfill this mission of creating a better world.

16
0:01:20.74,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Some chose the microscope as their instrument.

17
0:01:24.86,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Others chose dancing or painting,

18
0:01:28.171,000 --> 0:01:3,000
or making music like we just heard.

19
0:01:31.1,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Some chose the pen.

20
0:01:33.82,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Others work through the instrument of money.

21
0:01:38.3,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I made a different choice.

22
0:01:56.1,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Thanks.

23
0:02:00.94,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Ladies and gentlemen ...

24
0:02:04.38,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

25
0:02:06.38,000 --> 0:02:1,000
(Applause)

26
0:02:12.291,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I share your goals.

27
0:02:15.5,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I share the goals of the speakers you heard before.

28
0:02:20.78,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I did not choose to take up the pen,

29
0:02:26.82,000 --> 0:02:27,000
the brush,

30
0:02:28.86,000 --> 0:02:29,000
the camera.

31
0:02:30.82,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I chose this instrument.

32
0:02:34.7,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I chose the gun.

33
0:02:38.3,000 --> 0:02:4,000
For you, and you heard already,

34
0:02:40.78,000 --> 0:02:45,000
being so close to this gun may make you feel uneasy.

35
0:02:47.74,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It may even feel scary.

36
0:02:50.3,000 --> 0:02:53,000
A real gun at a few feet's distance.

37
0:02:54.74,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Let us stop for a moment and feel this uneasiness.

38
0:02:59.9,000 --> 0:03:,000
You could even hear it.

39
0:03:02.62,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Let us cherish the fact

40
0:03:04.82,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that probably most of you have never been close to a gun.

41
0:03:11.06,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It means the Netherlands is a peaceful country.

42
0:03:15.94,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The Netherlands is not at war.

43
0:03:19.38,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It means soldiers are not needed to patrol our streets.

44
0:03:24.86,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Guns are not a part of our lives.

45
0:03:29.78,000 --> 0:03:32,000
In many countries, it is a different story.

46
0:03:34.7,000 --> 0:03:38,000
In many countries, people are confronted with guns.

47
0:03:39.22,000 --> 0:03:4,000
They are oppressed.

48
0:03:41.1,000 --> 0:03:42,000
They are intimidated --

49
0:03:43.5,000 --> 0:03:44,000
by warlords,

50
0:03:45.86,000 --> 0:03:46,000
by terrorists,

51
0:03:48.02,000 --> 0:03:49,000
by criminals.

52
0:03:50.18,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Weapons can do a lot of harm.

53
0:03:53.3,000 --> 0:03:55,000
They are the cause of much distress.

54
0:03:56.34,000 --> 0:04:,000
Why then am I standing before you with this weapon?

55
0:04:01.34,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Why did I choose the gun as my instrument?

56
0:04:06.54,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Today I want to tell you why.

57
0:04:09.42,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Today I want to tell you

58
0:04:11.02,000 --> 0:04:13,000
why I chose the gun to create a better world.

59
0:04:14.94,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And I want to tell you how this gun can help.

60
0:04:21.42,000 --> 0:04:24,000
My story starts in the city of Nijmegen

61
0:04:26.78,000 --> 0:04:27,000
in the east of the Netherlands,

62
0:04:29.58,000 --> 0:04:31,000
the city where I was born.

63
0:04:33.74,000 --> 0:04:36,000
My father was a hardworking baker,

64
0:04:40.06,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but when he had finished work in the bakery,

65
0:04:42.94,000 --> 0:04:44,000
he often told me and my brother stories.

66
0:04:46.9,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And most of the time,

67
0:04:48.54,000 --> 0:04:51,000
he told me this story I'm going to share with you now.

68
0:04:53.58,000 --> 0:04:54,000
The story of what happened

69
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
when he was a conscripted soldier in the Dutch armed forces

70
0:04:59.62,000 --> 0:05:01,000
at the beginning of the Second World War.

71
0:05:03.42,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The Nazis invaded the Netherlands.

72
0:05:06.3,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Their grim plans were evident.

73
0:05:09.1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
They meant to rule by means of repression.

74
0:05:13.62,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Diplomacy had failed to stop the Germans.

75
0:05:17.94,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Only brute force remained.

76
0:05:21.62,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It was our last resort.

77
0:05:24.86,000 --> 0:05:27,000
My father was there to provide it.

78
0:05:29.3,000 --> 0:05:32,000
As the son of a farmer who knew how to hunt,

79
0:05:33.14,000 --> 0:05:35,000
my father was an excellent marksman.

80
0:05:36.18,000 --> 0:05:38,000
When he aimed, he never missed.

81
0:05:40.06,000 --> 0:05:43,000
At this decisive moment in Dutch history

82
0:05:43.1,000 --> 0:05:47,000
my father was positioned on the bank of the river Waal

83
0:05:47.94,000 --> 0:05:48,000
near the city of Nijmegen.

84
0:05:50.94,000 --> 0:05:55,000
He had a clear shot at the German soldiers who came to occupy a free country,

85
0:05:57.18,000 --> 0:05:58,000
his country,

86
0:05:58.78,000 --> 0:05:59,000
our country.

87
0:06:00.82,000 --> 0:06:02,000
He fired. Nothing happened.

88
0:06:03.98,000 --> 0:06:04,000
He fired again.

89
0:06:05.74,000 --> 0:06:07,000
No German soldier fell to the ground.

90
0:06:09.42,000 --> 0:06:13,000
My father had been given an old gun

91
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that could not even reach the opposite riverbank.

92
0:06:19.46,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Hitler's troops marched on,

93
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and there was nothing my father could do about it.

94
0:06:26.66,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Until the day my father died,

95
0:06:29.62,000 --> 0:06:32,000
he was frustrated about missing these shots.

96
0:06:34.34,000 --> 0:06:35,000
He could have done something.

97
0:06:36.86,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But with an old gun,

98
0:06:38.7,000 --> 0:06:4,000
not even the best marksman in the armed forces

99
0:06:41.62,000 --> 0:06:42,000
could have hit the mark.

100
0:06:44.38,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So this story stayed with me.

101
0:06:48.46,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Then in high school,

102
0:06:49.86,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I was gripped by the stories of the Allied soldiers --

103
0:06:54.7,000 --> 0:06:59,000
soldiers who left the safety of their own homes and risked their lives

104
0:06:59.98,000 --> 0:07:,000
to liberate a country

105
0:07:03.1,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and a people that they didn't know.

106
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
They liberated my birth town.

107
0:07:09.9,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It was then that I decided I would take up the gun --

108
0:07:15.78,000 --> 0:07:19,000
out of respect and gratitude for those men and women

109
0:07:20.46,000 --> 0:07:22,000
who came to liberate us.

110
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
From the awareness that sometimes only the gun

111
0:07:29.1,000 --> 0:07:33,000
can stand between good and evil.

112
0:07:34.14,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And that is why I took up the gun --

113
0:07:38.18,000 --> 0:07:39,000
not to shoot,

114
0:07:40.1,000 --> 0:07:41,000
not to kill,

115
0:07:41.58,000 --> 0:07:42,000
not to destroy,

116
0:07:43.86,000 --> 0:07:45,000
but to stop those who would do evil,

117
0:07:47.62,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to protect the vulnerable,

118
0:07:50.54,000 --> 0:07:52,000
to defend democratic values,

119
0:07:53.94,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to stand up for the freedom we have to talk here today in Amsterdam

120
0:08:00.42,000 --> 0:08:02,000
about how we can make the world a better place.

121
0:08:04.9,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

122
0:08:06.14,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I do not stand here today to tell you about the glory of weapons.

123
0:08:12.46,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I do not like guns.

124
0:08:15.74,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And once you have been under fire yourself,

125
0:08:20.34,000 --> 0:08:22,000
it brings home even more clearly

126
0:08:22.9,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that a gun is not some macho instrument to brag about.

127
0:08:28.86,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I stand here today

128
0:08:30.38,000 --> 0:08:35,000
to tell you about the use of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability.

129
0:08:38.38,000 --> 0:08:42,000
The gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability

130
0:08:42.74,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that we have in this world.

131
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Now this may sound contradictory to you.

132
0:08:49.66,000 --> 0:08:52,000
But not only have I seen with my own eyes

133
0:08:53.419,000 --> 0:08:56,000
during my deployments in Lebanon, Sarajevo

134
0:08:56.466,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and as the Netherlands' Chief of Defence,

135
0:09:00.3,000 --> 0:09:05,000
this is also supported by cold, hard statistics.

136
0:09:07.22,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Violence has declined dramatically over the last 500 years.

137
0:09:13.3,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news,

138
0:09:17.7,000 --> 0:09:21,000
wars between developed countries are no longer commonplace.

139
0:09:22.54,000 --> 0:09:23,000
The murder rate in Europe

140
0:09:23.82,000 --> 0:09:27,000
has dropped by a factor of 30 since the Middle Ages.

141
0:09:28.78,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And occurrences of civil war and repression

142
0:09:31.58,000 --> 0:09:33,000
have declined since the end of the Cold War.

143
0:09:35.46,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Statistics show that we are living in a relatively peaceful era.

144
0:09:41.74,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Why?

145
0:09:43.3,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Why has violence decreased?

146
0:09:46.54,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Has the human mind changed?

147
0:09:48.54,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Well, we were talking about the human mind this morning.

148
0:09:51.7,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Did we simply lose our beastly impulses for revenge,

149
0:09:56.54,000 --> 0:09:58,000
for violent rituals,

150
0:09:58.82,000 --> 0:09:59,000
for pure rage?

151
0:10:01.62,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Or is there something else?

152
0:10:04.9,000 --> 0:10:07,000
In his latest book, Harvard professor Steven Pinker --

153
0:10:08.54,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and many other thinkers before him --

154
0:10:10.94,000 --> 0:10:14,000
concludes that one of the main drivers

155
0:10:15.78,000 --> 0:10:17,000
behind less violent societies

156
0:10:18.34,000 --> 0:10:2,000
is the spread of the constitutional state

157
0:10:22.34,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and the introduction, on a large scale,

158
0:10:25.548,000 --> 0:10:28,000
of the state monopoly on the legitimized use of violence --

159
0:10:30.7,000 --> 0:10:34,000
legitimized by a democratically elected government,

160
0:10:36.38,000 --> 0:10:41,000
legitimized by checks and balances and an independent judicial system.

161
0:10:42.9,000 --> 0:10:45,000
In other words, a state monopoly

162
0:10:45.98,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that has the use of violence well under control.

163
0:10:51.66,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Such a state monopoly on violence, first of all, serves as a reassurance.

164
0:10:59.42,000 --> 0:11:01,000
It removes the incentive for an arms race

165
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
between potentially hostile groups in our societies.

166
0:11:06.78,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Secondly, the presence of penalties

167
0:11:09.58,000 --> 0:11:12,000
that outweigh the benefits of using violence

168
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
tips the balance even further.

169
0:11:16.58,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Abstaining from violence

170
0:11:18.42,000 --> 0:11:21,000
becomes more profitable than starting a war.

171
0:11:22.86,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Now nonviolence starts to work like a flywheel.

172
0:11:28.42,000 --> 0:11:3,000
It enhances peace even further.

173
0:11:32.1,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Where there is no conflict, trade flourishes.

174
0:11:36.74,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And trade is another important incentive against violence.

175
0:11:41.78,000 --> 0:11:46,000
With trade, there's mutual interdependency and mutual gain between parties.

176
0:11:48.66,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And when there is mutual gain, both sides stand to lose more

177
0:11:53.74,000 --> 0:11:55,000
than they would gain if they started a war.

178
0:11:58.14,000 --> 0:12:02,000
War is simply no longer the best option,

179
0:12:02.62,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and that is why violence has decreased.

180
0:12:08.34,000 --> 0:12:09,000
This, ladies and gentlemen,

181
0:12:10.14,000 --> 0:12:14,000
is the rationale behind the existence of my armed forces.

182
0:12:15.82,000 --> 0:12:19,000
The armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence.

183
0:12:20.9,000 --> 0:12:22,000
We do this in a legitimized way

184
0:12:23.38,000 --> 0:12:28,000
only after our democracy has asked us to do so.

185
0:12:30.34,000 --> 0:12:35,000
It is this legitimate, controlled use of the gun

186
0:12:35.54,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that has contributed greatly

187
0:12:37.38,000 --> 0:12:42,000
to reducing the statistics of war, conflict and violence around the globe.

188
0:12:43.78,000 --> 0:12:46,000
It is this participation in peacekeeping missions

189
0:12:47.34,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that has led to the resolution of many civil wars.

190
0:12:52.02,000 --> 0:12:57,000
My soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace.

191
0:12:58.54,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And this is exactly why failed states are so dangerous.

192
0:13:03.9,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Failed states have no legitimized, democratically controlled use of force.

193
0:13:09.5,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Failed states do not know of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability.

194
0:13:16.86,000 --> 0:13:22,000
That is why failed states can drag down a whole region into chaos and conflict.

195
0:13:24.22,000 --> 0:13:27,000
That is why spreading the concept of the constitutional state

196
0:13:28.14,000 --> 0:13:31,000
is such an important aspect of our foreign missions.

197
0:13:32.78,000 --> 0:13:35,000
That is why we are trying to build a judicial system

198
0:13:36.54,000 --> 0:13:38,000
right now in Afghanistan.

199
0:13:39.82,000 --> 0:13:43,000
That is why we train police officers, we train judges,

200
0:13:44.1,000 --> 0:13:46,000
we train public prosecutors around the world.

201
0:13:47.86,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And that is why --

202
0:13:49.22,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and in the Netherlands, we are very unique in that --

203
0:13:52.54,000 --> 0:13:55,000
that is why the Dutch constitution states

204
0:13:56.3,000 --> 0:13:59,000
that one of the main tasks of the armed forces

205
0:13:59.58,000 --> 0:14:03,000
is to uphold and promote the international rule of law.

206
0:14:06.38,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

207
0:14:07.98,000 --> 0:14:13,000
looking at this gun, we are confronted with the ugly side of the human mind.

208
0:14:15.9,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Every day I hope that politicians, diplomats, development workers

209
0:14:21.94,000 --> 0:14:24,000
can turn conflict into peace

210
0:14:25.42,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and threat

211
0:14:27.46,000 --> 0:14:28,000
into hope.

212
0:14:29.3,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And I hope that one day armies can be disbanded

213
0:14:34.1,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and humans will find a way of living together

214
0:14:37.02,000 --> 0:14:39,000
without violence and oppression.

215
0:14:40.46,000 --> 0:14:42,000
But until that day comes,

216
0:14:44.14,000 --> 0:14:49,000
we will have to make ideals and human failure

217
0:14:49.54,000 --> 0:14:5,000
meet somewhere in the middle.

218
0:14:52.18,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Until that day comes, I stand for my father

219
0:14:57.22,000 --> 0:15:,000
who tried to shoot the Nazis with an old gun.

220
0:15:01.46,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I stand for my men and women who are prepared to risk their lives

221
0:15:07.54,000 --> 0:15:09,000
for a less violent world for all of us.

222
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
I stand for this soldier who suffered partial hearing loss

223
0:15:18.18,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and sustained permanent injuries to her leg,

224
0:15:21.34,000 --> 0:15:25,000
when she was hit by a rocket on a mission in Afghanistan.

225
0:15:27.86,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

226
0:15:29.66,000 --> 0:15:34,000
until the day comes when we can do away with the gun,

227
0:15:34.94,000 --> 0:15:36,000
I hope we all agree

228
0:15:37.82,000 --> 0:15:4,000
that peace and stability do not come free of charge.

229
0:15:43.1,000 --> 0:15:47,000
It takes hard work, often behind the scenes.

230
0:15:48.9,000 --> 0:15:52,000
It takes good equipment and well-trained, dedicated soldiers.

231
0:15:54.54,000 --> 0:15:58,000
I hope you will support the efforts of our armed forces

232
0:15:59.5,000 --> 0:16:02,000
to train soldiers like this young captain

233
0:16:02.54,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and provide her with a good gun,

234
0:16:05.46,000 --> 0:16:07,000
instead of the bad gun my father was given.

235
0:16:09.06,000 --> 0:16:13,000
I hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there,

236
0:16:14.78,000 --> 0:16:15,000
when they come home

237
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and when they are injured and need our care.

238
0:16:21.1,000 --> 0:16:25,000
They put their lives on the line, for us, for you,

239
0:16:25.94,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and we cannot let them down.

240
0:16:29.9,000 --> 0:16:33,000
I hope you will respect my soldiers,

241
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
this soldier with this gun.

242
0:16:37.18,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Because she wants a better world.

243
0:16:40.5,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Because she makes an active contribution to a better world,

244
0:16:45.34,000 --> 0:16:47,000
just like all of us here today.

245
0:16:49.14,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Thank you very much.

246
0:16:50.62,000 --> 0:16:55,000
(Applause)

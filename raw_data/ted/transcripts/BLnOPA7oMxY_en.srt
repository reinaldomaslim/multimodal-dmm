1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I want you now to imagine

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
a wearable robot

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that gives you superhuman abilities,

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
or another one that takes wheelchair users

5
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
up standing and walking again.

6
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
We at Berkeley Bionics

7
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
call these robots exoskeletons.

8
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
These are nothing else

9
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
than something that you put on in the morning,

10
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and it will give you extra strength,

11
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and it will further enhance your speed,

12
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and it will help you, for instance, to manage your balance.

13
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
It is actually the true integration

14
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
of the man and the machine.

15
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But not only that --

16
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
it will integrate and network you

17
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to the universe

18
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and other devices out there.

19
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
This is just not some blue sky thinking.

20
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
To show you now what we are working on

21
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
by starting out talking about

22
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
the American soldier,

23
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs,

24
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and they are being asked to carry more equipment.

25
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Obviously, this is resulting

26
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
in some major complications --

27
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
back injuries, 30 percent of them --

28
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
chronic back injuries.

29
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So we thought we would look at this challenge

30
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and create an exoskeleton

31
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that would help deal with this issue.

32
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So let me now introduce to you HULC --

33
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
or the Human Universal

34
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Load Carrier.

35
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Soldier: With the HULC exoskeleton,

36
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I can carry 200 lbs. over varied terrain

37
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
for many hours.

38
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Its flexible design allows for deep squats,

39
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
crawls and high-agility movements.

40
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
It senses what I want to do, where I want to go,

41
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and then augments my strength and endurance.

42
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Eythor Bender: We are ready with our industry partner

43
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to introduce this device,

44
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
this new exoskeleton this year.

45
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So this is for real.

46
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Now let's turn our heads

47
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
towards the wheelchair users,

48
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
something that I'm particularly passionate about.

49
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
There are 68 million people

50
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide.

51
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
This is about one percent of the total population.

52
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And that's actually a conservative estimate.

53
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We are talking here about, oftentimes,

54
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
very young individuals with spinal cord injuries,

55
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that in the prime of their life -- 20s, 30s, 40s --

56
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
hit a wall

57
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and the wheelchair's the only option.

58
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But it is also the aging population

59
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that is multiplying in numbers.

60
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And the only option, pretty much --

61
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
when it's stroke or other complications --

62
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
is the wheelchair.

63
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And that is actually for the last 500 years,

64
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
since its very successful introduction, I must say.

65
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So we thought we would start

66
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
writing a brand new chapter

67
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
of mobility.

68
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Let me now introduce you to eLEGS

69
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that is worn by Amanda Boxtel

70
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured,

71
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and as a result of that

72
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
she has not been able to walk

73
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
for 19 years until now.

74
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Applause)

75
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Amanda Boxtel: Thank you.

76
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Applause)

77
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
EB: Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set.

78
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It has sensors.

79
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It's completely non-invasive,

80
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
sensors in the crutches

81
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that send signals back to our onboard computer

82
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that is sitting here at her back.

83
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
There are battery packs here as well

84
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that power motors that are sitting at her hips,

85
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
as well as her knee joints,

86
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that move her forward

87
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
in this kind of smooth and very natural gait.

88
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
AB: I was 24 years old

89
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and at the top of my game

90
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
when a freak summersault while downhill skiing

91
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
paralyzed me.

92
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
In a split second,

93
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I lost all sensation and movement

94
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
below my pelvis.

95
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Not long afterwards,

96
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
a doctor strode into my hospital room,

97
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and he said, "Amanda,

98
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
you'll never walk again."

99
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And that was 19 yeas ago.

100
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
He robbed

101
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
every ounce of hope

102
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
from my being.

103
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Adaptive technology

104
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
has since enabled me

105
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to learn how to downhill ski again,

106
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to rock climb and even handcycle.

107
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But nothing has been invented

108
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that enables me to walk,

109
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
until now.

110
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Applause)

111
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Thank you.

112
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Applause)

113
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
EB: As you can see,

114
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
we have the technology,

115
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
we have the platforms

116
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to sit down and have discussions with you.

117
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
It's in our hands,

118
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and we have all the potential here

119
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
to change the lives

120
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
of future generations --

121
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
not only for the soldiers,

122
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users,

123
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but for everyone.

124
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
AB: Thanks.

125
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Applause)

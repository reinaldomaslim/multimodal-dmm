1
0:00:13.037,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It was my third day on the job at a hot Silicon Valley start-up

2
0:00:17.442,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in early 2013.

3
0:00:19.766,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I was twice the age of the dozen engineers in the room.

4
0:00:24.671,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I'd been brought in to the company

5
0:00:26.395,000 --> 0:00:28,000
because I was a seasoned expert in my field,

6
0:00:28.698,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but in this particular room,

7
0:00:30.356,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I felt like a newbie amongst the tech geniuses.

8
0:00:34.242,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I was listening to them talk

9
0:00:37.489,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and thinking that the best thing I could do was be invisible.

10
0:00:41.087,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And then suddenly, the 25-year-old wizard leading the meeting stared at me

11
0:00:45.57,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and asked, "If you shipped a feature and no one used it,

12
0:00:49.736,000 --> 0:00:5,000
did it really ship?"

13
0:00:51.469,000 --> 0:00:52,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:53.987,000 --> 0:00:54,000
"Ship a feature"?

15
0:00:55.915,000 --> 0:00:58,000
In that moment, Chip knew he was in deep ship.

16
0:00:59.405,000 --> 0:01:,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:00.436,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I had no idea what he was talking about.

18
0:01:04.184,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I just sat there awkwardly,

19
0:01:07.634,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and mercifully, he moved on to someone else.

20
0:01:10.005,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I slid down in my chair,

21
0:01:12.027,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and I couldn't wait for that meeting to end.

22
0:01:15.306,000 --> 0:01:17,000
That was my introduction to Airbnb.

23
0:01:18.907,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I was asked and invited by the three millennial cofounders

24
0:01:22.991,000 --> 0:01:23,000
to join their company

25
0:01:24.173,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to help them take their fast-growing tech start-up

26
0:01:26.859,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and turn it into a global hospitality brand,

27
0:01:29.553,000 --> 0:01:33,000
as well as to be the in-house mentor for CEO Brian Chesky.

28
0:01:33.858,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Now, I'd spent from age 26 to 52 being a boutique hotel entrepreneur,

29
0:01:38.778,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and so I guess I'd learned a few things along the way

30
0:01:41.331,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and accumulated some hospitality knowledge.

31
0:01:43.971,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But after my first week,

32
0:01:45.821,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I realized that the brave new home-sharing world

33
0:01:48.776,000 --> 0:01:52,000
didn't need much of my old-school bricks-and-mortar hotel insights.

34
0:01:53.926,000 --> 0:01:55,000
A stark reality rocked me:

35
0:01:56.899,000 --> 0:01:57,000
What do I have to offer?

36
0:01:59.929,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I'd never been in a tech company before.

37
0:02:02.434,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Five and a half years ago, I had never heard of the "sharing economy,"

38
0:02:07.268,000 --> 0:02:09,000
nor did I have an Uber or Lyft app on my phone.

39
0:02:10.534,000 --> 0:02:12,000
This was not my natural habitat.

40
0:02:14.179,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So, I decided at that moment that I could either run for the hills,

41
0:02:18.984,000 --> 0:02:2,000
or cast judgment on these young geniuses,

42
0:02:21.455,000 --> 0:02:24,000
or instead, turn the judgment into curiosity

43
0:02:24.984,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and actually see if I could match my wise eyes with their fresh eyes.

44
0:02:29.955,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I fancied myself a modern Margaret Mead amongst the millennials,

45
0:02:35.568,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and I quickly learned that I had as much to offer them

46
0:02:39.447,000 --> 0:02:4,000
as they did to me.

47
0:02:41.331,000 --> 0:02:45,000
The more I've seen and learned about our respective generations,

48
0:02:46.129,000 --> 0:02:5,000
the more I realize that we often don't trust each other enough

49
0:02:50.42,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to actually share our respective wisdom.

50
0:02:53.159,000 --> 0:02:55,000
We may share a border,

51
0:02:55.434,000 --> 0:02:57,000
but we don't necessarily trust each other enough

52
0:02:58.102,000 --> 0:03:,000
to share that respective wisdom.

53
0:03:01.654,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I believe, looking at the modern workplace,

54
0:03:04.958,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that the trade agreement of our time

55
0:03:08.727,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is opening up these intergenerational pipelines of wisdom

56
0:03:14.122,000 --> 0:03:16,000
so that we can all learn from each other.

57
0:03:17.336,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Almost 40 percent of us in the United States

58
0:03:21.791,000 --> 0:03:23,000
have a boss that's younger than us,

59
0:03:24.076,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and that number is growing quickly.

60
0:03:27.079,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Power is cascading to the young like never before

61
0:03:30.363,000 --> 0:03:33,000
because of our increasing reliance on DQ:

62
0:03:34.103,000 --> 0:03:35,000
digital intelligence.

63
0:03:36.213,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We're seeing young founders of companies in their early 20s

64
0:03:40.048,000 --> 0:03:44,000
scale them up to global giants by the time they get to 30,

65
0:03:44.999,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and yet, we expect these young digital leaders

66
0:03:48.478,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to somehow miraculously embody the relationship wisdoms

67
0:03:53.635,000 --> 0:03:55,000
we older workers have had decades to learn.

68
0:03:57.125,000 --> 0:04:,000
It's hard to microwave your emotional intelligence.

69
0:04:01.689,000 --> 0:04:06,000
There's ample evidence that gender- and ethnically diverse companies

70
0:04:07.451,000 --> 0:04:08,000
are more effective.

71
0:04:09.426,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But what about age?

72
0:04:11.265,000 --> 0:04:14,000
This is a very important question, because for the first time ever,

73
0:04:14.909,000 --> 0:04:17,000
we have five generations in the workplace at the same time, unintentionally.

74
0:04:18.759,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Maybe it's time we got a little more intentional

75
0:04:21.229,000 --> 0:04:22,000
about how we work collectively.

76
0:04:23.979,000 --> 0:04:25,000
There have been a number of European studies

77
0:04:26.756,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that have shown that age-diverse teams are more effective and successful.

78
0:04:32.19,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So why is that only eight percent of the companies

79
0:04:36.391,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that have a diversity and inclusion program

80
0:04:40.486,000 --> 0:04:42,000
have actually expanded that strategy

81
0:04:42.672,000 --> 0:04:47,000
to include age as just as important of a demographic as gender or race?

82
0:04:48.422,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Maybe they didn't get the memo:

83
0:04:50.223,000 --> 0:04:51,000
the world is getting older!

84
0:04:52.948,000 --> 0:04:53,000
One of the paradoxes of our time

85
0:04:54.959,000 --> 0:04:59,000
is that baby boomers are more vibrant and healthy longer into life,

86
0:05:00.11,000 --> 0:05:02,000
we're actually working later into life,

87
0:05:02.444,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and yet we're feeling less and less relevant.

88
0:05:05.789,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Some of us feel like a carton of milk -- an old carton of milk --

89
0:05:09.628,000 --> 0:05:12,000
with an expiration date stamped on our wrinkled foreheads.

90
0:05:14.092,000 --> 0:05:16,000
For many of us in midlife, this isn't just a feeling,

91
0:05:16.955,000 --> 0:05:21,000
it is a harsh reality, when we suddenly lose our job and the phone stops ringing.

92
0:05:22.844,000 --> 0:05:26,000
For many of us, justifiably, we worry that people see our experience

93
0:05:27.8,000 --> 0:05:29,000
as a liability, not an asset.

94
0:05:31.688,000 --> 0:05:34,000
You've heard of the old phrase -- or maybe the relatively new phrase --

95
0:05:35.643,000 --> 0:05:37,000
"Sixty is the new forty, physically."

96
0:05:38.12,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Right?

97
0:05:39.311,000 --> 0:05:42,000
When it comes to power in the workplace today,

98
0:05:42.897,000 --> 0:05:43,000
30 is the new 50.

99
0:05:45.797,000 --> 0:05:47,000
All right, well, this is all pretty exciting, right?

100
0:05:48.695,000 --> 0:05:49,000
(Laughter)

101
0:05:49.789,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Truthfully, power is moving 10 years younger.

102
0:05:53.048,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We're all going to live 10 years longer.

103
0:05:55.307,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Do the math.

104
0:05:56.834,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Society has created a new 20-year irrelevancy gap.

105
0:06:01.325,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Midlife used to be 45 to 65,

106
0:06:03.563,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but I would suggest it now stretches into a midlife marathon 40 years long,

107
0:06:08.284,000 --> 0:06:09,000
from 35 to 75.

108
0:06:10.607,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But wait -- there is a bright spot.

109
0:06:12.954,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Why is it that we actually get smarter and wiser about our humanity as we age?

110
0:06:19.56,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Our physical peak may be our 20s,

111
0:06:23.64,000 --> 0:06:26,000
our financial and salary peak may be age 50,

112
0:06:27.538,000 --> 0:06:3,000
but our emotional peak is in midlife and beyond,

113
0:06:31.472,000 --> 0:06:36,000
because we have developed pattern recognition about ourselves and others.

114
0:06:36.86,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So how can we get companies to tap into that wisdom

115
0:06:40.537,000 --> 0:06:42,000
of the midlife folks,

116
0:06:42.881,000 --> 0:06:46,000
just as they nurture their digital young geniuses as well?

117
0:06:47.547,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The most successful companies today and in the future

118
0:06:51.105,000 --> 0:06:54,000
will actually learn how to create a powerful alchemy of the two.

119
0:06:54.794,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Here's how the alchemy worked for me at Airbnb:

120
0:06:57.349,000 --> 0:07:,000
I was assigned a young, smart partner,

121
0:07:00.43,000 --> 0:07:03,000
who helped me develop a hospitality department.

122
0:07:03.667,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Early on, Laura Hughes could see that I was a little lost in this habitat,

123
0:07:08.612,000 --> 0:07:1,000
so she often sat right next to me in meetings

124
0:07:11.226,000 --> 0:07:12,000
so she could be my tech translator,

125
0:07:13.228,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and I could write her notes and she could tell me, "That's what that means."

126
0:07:16.89,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Laura was 27 years old,

127
0:07:18.489,000 --> 0:07:19,000
she'd worked for Google for four years

128
0:07:20.436,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and then for a year and a half at Airbnb when I met her.

129
0:07:24.386,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Like many of her millennial cohorts,

130
0:07:27.074,000 --> 0:07:31,000
she had actually grown into a managerial role

131
0:07:31.127,000 --> 0:07:33,000
before she'd gotten any formal leadership training.

132
0:07:34.836,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I don't care if you're in the B-to-B world,

133
0:07:37.283,000 --> 0:07:4,000
the B-to-C world, the C-to-C world or the A-to-Z world,

134
0:07:41.248,000 --> 0:07:44,000
business is fundamentally H-to-H:

135
0:07:44.74,000 --> 0:07:45,000
human to human.

136
0:07:46.709,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And yet, Laura's approach to leadership

137
0:07:49.554,000 --> 0:07:52,000
was really formed in the technocratic world,

138
0:07:52.737,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and it was purely metric driven.

139
0:07:55.236,000 --> 0:07:57,000
One of the things she said to me in the first few months was,

140
0:07:58.198,000 --> 0:08:,000
"I love the fact that your approach to leadership

141
0:08:00.548,000 --> 0:08:03,000
is to create a compelling vision that becomes a North Star for us."

142
0:08:04.782,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Now, my fact knowledge,

143
0:08:06.531,000 --> 0:08:09,000
as in, how many rooms a maid cleans in an eight-hour shift,

144
0:08:10.512,000 --> 0:08:12,000
might not be all that important in a home-sharing world.

145
0:08:13.912,000 --> 0:08:17,000
My process knowledge of "How do you get things done?"

146
0:08:18.235,000 --> 0:08:22,000
based upon understanding the underlying motivations of everybody in the room,

147
0:08:22.961,000 --> 0:08:23,000
was incredibly valuable,

148
0:08:24.739,000 --> 0:08:28,000
in a company where most people didn't have a lot of organizational experience.

149
0:08:30.169,000 --> 0:08:32,000
As I spent more time at Airbnb,

150
0:08:32.357,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I realized it's possible a new kind of elder was emerging

151
0:08:36.871,000 --> 0:08:37,000
in the workplace.

152
0:08:38.357,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Not the elder of the past, who actually was regarded with reverence.

153
0:08:43.2,000 --> 0:08:48,000
No, what is striking about the modern elder is their relevance,

154
0:08:48.69,000 --> 0:08:52,000
their ability to use timeless wisdom and apply it to modern-day problems.

155
0:08:54.788,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Maybe it's time we actually valued wisdom as much as we do disruption.

156
0:09:00.615,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And maybe it's time -- not just maybe, it is time --

157
0:09:04.275,000 --> 0:09:07,000
for us to definitely reclaim the word "elder"

158
0:09:07.667,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and give it a modern twist.

159
0:09:09.964,000 --> 0:09:13,000
The modern elder is as much an intern as they are a mentor,

160
0:09:13.994,000 --> 0:09:16,000
because they realize, in a world that is changing so quickly,

161
0:09:17.87,000 --> 0:09:21,000
their beginners' mind and their catalytic curiosity is a life-affirming elixir,

162
0:09:22.827,000 --> 0:09:24,000
not just for themselves but for everyone around them.

163
0:09:25.85,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Intergenerational improv has been known in music and the arts:

164
0:09:30.096,000 --> 0:09:33,000
think Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga

165
0:09:33.71,000 --> 0:09:36,000
or Wynton Marsalis and the Young Stars of Jazz.

166
0:09:38.05,000 --> 0:09:44,000
This kind of riffing in the business world is often called "mutual mentorship":

167
0:09:45.068,000 --> 0:09:5,000
millennial DQ for Gen X and boomer EQ.

168
0:09:51.562,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I got to experience that kind of intergenerational reciprocity with Laura

169
0:09:57.3,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and our stellar data science team

170
0:09:59.19,000 --> 0:10:01,000
when we were actually remaking and evolving

171
0:10:02.018,000 --> 0:10:04,000
the Airbnb peer-to-peer review system,

172
0:10:04.683,000 --> 0:10:08,000
using Laura's analytical mind and my human-centered intuition.

173
0:10:09.975,000 --> 0:10:14,000
With that perfect alchemy of algorithm and people wisdom,

174
0:10:15.506,000 --> 0:10:18,000
we were able to create and instantaneous feedback loop

175
0:10:19.441,000 --> 0:10:23,000
that helped our hosts better understand the needs of our guests.

176
0:10:24.758,000 --> 0:10:26,000
High tech meets high touch.

177
0:10:28.269,000 --> 0:10:31,000
At Airbnb, I also learned as a modern elder

178
0:10:31.71,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that my role was to intern publicly and mentor privately.

179
0:10:37.312,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Search engines are brilliant at giving you an answer,

180
0:10:41.296,000 --> 0:10:46,000
but a wise, sage guide can offer you just the right question.

181
0:10:48.272,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Google does not understand, at least not yet,

182
0:10:50.974,000 --> 0:10:54,000
nuance like a finely attuned human heart and mind.

183
0:10:55.671,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Over time,

184
0:10:57.738,000 --> 0:10:58,000
to my surprise,

185
0:10:59.279,000 --> 0:11:02,000
dozens and dozens of young employees at Airbnb sought me out

186
0:11:03.089,000 --> 0:11:05,000
for private mentoring sessions.

187
0:11:05.132,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But in reality, we were often just mentoring each other.

188
0:11:09.559,000 --> 0:11:15,000
In sum, CEO Brian Chesky brought me in for my industry knowledge,

189
0:11:15.899,000 --> 0:11:18,000
but what I really offered was my well-earned wisdom.

190
0:11:20.182,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Maybe it's time we retire the term "knowledge worker"

191
0:11:25.182,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and replaced it with "wisdom worker."

192
0:11:28.775,000 --> 0:11:3,000
We have five generations in the workplace today,

193
0:11:31.427,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and we can operate like separate isolationist countries,

194
0:11:34.843,000 --> 0:11:4,000
or we can actually start to find a way to bridge these generational borders.

195
0:11:42.25,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And it's time for us to actually look at how to change up the physics of wisdom

196
0:11:46.849,000 --> 0:11:47,000
so it actually flows in both directions,

197
0:11:48.841,000 --> 0:11:51,000
from old to young and from young to old.

198
0:11:52.908,000 --> 0:11:54,000
How can you apply this in your own life?

199
0:11:55.837,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Personally, who can you reach out to

200
0:11:58.79,000 --> 0:12:01,000
to create a mutual mentorship relationship?

201
0:12:02.843,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And organizationally, how can you create the conditions

202
0:12:07.516,000 --> 0:12:1,000
to foster an intergenerational flow of wisdom?

203
0:12:12.016,000 --> 0:12:15,000
This is the new sharing economy.

204
0:12:15.792,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Thank you.

205
0:12:16.967,000 --> 0:12:18,000

1
0:00:12.837,000 --> 0:00:14,000
How much do you need to know about a person

2
0:00:14.862,000 --> 0:00:16,000
before you'd feel comfortable making a loan?

3
0:00:18.044,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Suppose you wanted to lend 1,000 dollars

4
0:00:20.523,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to the person sitting two rows behind you.

5
0:00:23.19,000 --> 0:00:25,000
What would you need to know about that person

6
0:00:25.346,000 --> 0:00:26,000
before you'd feel comfortable?

7
0:00:27.291,000 --> 0:00:3,000
My mom came to the US from India in her late thirties.

8
0:00:31.614,000 --> 0:00:32,000
She's a doctor in Brooklyn,

9
0:00:33.07,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and she often lets friends and neighbors come to see her for health services,

10
0:00:37.317,000 --> 0:00:39,000
whether they can pay right away or not.

11
0:00:39.955,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I remember running into her patients with her at the grocery store

12
0:00:43.186,000 --> 0:00:44,000
or on the sidewalk,

13
0:00:44.361,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and sometimes they would come and pay her right on the spot

14
0:00:47.225,000 --> 0:00:48,000
for previous appointments.

15
0:00:48.607,000 --> 0:00:49,000
She would thank them,

16
0:00:49.87,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and ask them about their families and their health.

17
0:00:53.466,000 --> 0:00:56,000
She gave them credit because she trusted them.

18
0:00:57.122,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Most of us are like my mom.

19
0:00:59.899,000 --> 0:01:01,000
We would give credit to someone we know

20
0:01:02.786,000 --> 0:01:03,000
or that we live next to.

21
0:01:04.206,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But most of us are probably not going to lend to a stranger

22
0:01:07.934,000 --> 0:01:1,000
unless we know a little something about them.

23
0:01:11.634,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Banks, credit card companies and other financial institutions

24
0:01:15.361,000 --> 0:01:17,000
don't know us on a personal level,

25
0:01:17.645,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but they do have a way of trusting us,

26
0:01:20.548,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and that's through our credit scores.

27
0:01:23.033,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Our credit scores have been created

28
0:01:25.052,000 --> 0:01:29,000
through an aggregation and analysis of our public consumer credit data.

29
0:01:29.596,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And because of them, we have pretty much easy access

30
0:01:32.861,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to all of the goods and services that we need,

31
0:01:35.329,000 --> 0:01:37,000
from getting electricity to buying a home,

32
0:01:38.197,000 --> 0:01:4,000
or taking a risk and starting a business.

33
0:01:41.561,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But ...

34
0:01:42.746,000 --> 0:01:46,000
there are 2.5 billion people around the world

35
0:01:47.137,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that don't have a credit score.

36
0:01:49.247,000 --> 0:01:52,000
That's a third of the world's population.

37
0:01:52.93,000 --> 0:01:53,000
They don't have a score

38
0:01:54.209,000 --> 0:01:57,000
because there are no formal public records on them --

39
0:01:57.494,000 --> 0:01:58,000
no bank accounts,

40
0:01:58.882,000 --> 0:01:59,000
no credit histories

41
0:02:00.4,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and no social security numbers.

42
0:02:02.482,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And because they don't have a score,

43
0:02:04.225,000 --> 0:02:08,000
they don't have access to the credit or financial products

44
0:02:08.9,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that can improve their lives.

45
0:02:11.509,000 --> 0:02:13,000
They are not trusted.

46
0:02:14.968,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So we wanted to find a way to build trust

47
0:02:18.162,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and to open up financial access for these 2.5 billion.

48
0:02:22.772,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So we created a mobile application

49
0:02:25.262,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that builds credit scores for them using mobile data.

50
0:02:30.345,000 --> 0:02:34,000
There are currently over one billion smartphones in emerging markets.

51
0:02:34.825,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And people are using them the same way that we do.

52
0:02:38.235,000 --> 0:02:4,000
They're texting their friends, they're looking up directions,

53
0:02:41.228,000 --> 0:02:42,000
they're browsing the Internet

54
0:02:42.664,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and they're even making financial transactions.

55
0:02:45.167,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Over time, this data is getting captured on our phones,

56
0:02:48.377,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and it provides a really rich picture of a person's life.

57
0:02:53.132,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Our customers give us access to this data

58
0:02:55.332,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and we capture it through our mobile application.

59
0:02:58.466,000 --> 0:03:,000
It helps us understand the creditworthiness

60
0:03:01.134,000 --> 0:03:05,000
of people like Jenipher, a small-business owner in Nairobi, Kenya.

61
0:03:06.29,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Jenipher is 65 years old, and for decades has been running a food stall

62
0:03:11.197,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in the central business district.

63
0:03:13.897,000 --> 0:03:16,000
She has three sons who she put through vocational school,

64
0:03:17.12,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and she's also the leader of her local chama,

65
0:03:19.668,000 --> 0:03:2,000
or savings group.

66
0:03:21.609,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Jenipher's food stall does well.

67
0:03:23.556,000 --> 0:03:26,000
She makes just enough every day to cover her expenses.

68
0:03:27.024,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But she's not financially secure.

69
0:03:29.842,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Any emergency could force her into debt.

70
0:03:32.887,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And she has no discretionary income

71
0:03:34.758,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to improve her family's way of living,

72
0:03:37.02,000 --> 0:03:38,000
for emergencies,

73
0:03:38.283,000 --> 0:03:4,000
or for investing into growing her business.

74
0:03:42.065,000 --> 0:03:45,000
If Jenipher wants credit, her options are limited.

75
0:03:45.733,000 --> 0:03:46,000
She could get a microloan,

76
0:03:47.135,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but she'd have to form a group that could help vouch for her credibility.

77
0:03:51.003,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And even then, the loan sizes would be way too small

78
0:03:53.999,000 --> 0:03:55,000
to really have an impact on her business,

79
0:03:56.28,000 --> 0:03:58,000
averaging around 150 dollars.

80
0:03:59.525,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Loan sharks are always an option,

81
0:04:02.067,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but with interest rates that are well above 300 percent,

82
0:04:06.041,000 --> 0:04:07,000
they're financially risky.

83
0:04:08.079,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And because Jenipher doesn't have collateral or a credit history,

84
0:04:12.088,000 --> 0:04:15,000
she can't walk into a bank and ask for a business loan.

85
0:04:16.331,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But one day,

86
0:04:17.678,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Jenipher's son convinced her to download our application

87
0:04:21.68,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and apply for a loan.

88
0:04:23.407,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Jenipher answered a few questions on her phone

89
0:04:25.97,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and she gave us access to a few key data points on her device.

90
0:04:30.561,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And here's what we saw.

91
0:04:32.392,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So, bad news first.

92
0:04:34.996,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Jenipher had a low savings balance and no previous loan history.

93
0:04:40.395,000 --> 0:04:41,000
These are factors

94
0:04:41.57,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that would have thrown up a red flag to a traditional bank.

95
0:04:44.62,000 --> 0:04:46,000
But there were other points in her history that showed us

96
0:04:47.375,000 --> 0:04:5,000
a much richer picture of her potential.

97
0:04:51.342,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So for one,

98
0:04:52.517,000 --> 0:04:55,000
we saw that she made regular phone calls to her family in Uganda.

99
0:04:57.629,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Well, it turns out that the data shows

100
0:05:00.11,000 --> 0:05:02,000
a four percent increase in repayment

101
0:05:02.868,000 --> 0:05:06,000
among people who consistently communicate with a few close contacts.

102
0:05:08.657,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We could also see

103
0:05:09.84,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that though she traveled around a lot throughout the day,

104
0:05:12.672,000 --> 0:05:14,000
she actually had pretty regular travel patterns,

105
0:05:15.427,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and she was either at home or at her food stall.

106
0:05:19.315,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And the data shows a six percent increase in repayment

107
0:05:23.326,000 --> 0:05:25,000
among customers who are consistent

108
0:05:25.737,000 --> 0:05:27,000
with where they spend most of their time.

109
0:05:29.349,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We could also see that she communicated a lot

110
0:05:31.954,000 --> 0:05:33,000
with many different people throughout the day

111
0:05:34.326,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and that she had a strong support network.

112
0:05:37.287,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Our data shows

113
0:05:38.704,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that people who communicate with more than 58 different contacts

114
0:05:43.408,000 --> 0:05:45,000
tend to be more likely to be good borrowers.

115
0:05:46.333,000 --> 0:05:47,000
In Jenipher's case,

116
0:05:47.626,000 --> 0:05:51,000
she communicated with 89 different individuals,

117
0:05:51.693,000 --> 0:05:54,000
which showed a nine percent increase in her repayment.

118
0:05:55.888,000 --> 0:05:58,000
These are just some of the thousands of different data points

119
0:05:59.679,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that we look at to understand a person's creditworthiness.

120
0:06:03.397,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And after analyzing all of these different data points,

121
0:06:06.494,000 --> 0:06:07,000
we took the first risk

122
0:06:08.49,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and gave Jenipher a loan.

123
0:06:11.37,000 --> 0:06:14,000
This is data that would not be found on a paper trail

124
0:06:14.72,000 --> 0:06:16,000
or in any formal financial record.

125
0:06:17.72,000 --> 0:06:18,000
But it proves trust.

126
0:06:20.193,000 --> 0:06:21,000
By looking beyond income,

127
0:06:22.194,000 --> 0:06:24,000
we can see that people in emerging markets

128
0:06:24.375,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that may seem risky and unpredictable on the surface

129
0:06:28.068,000 --> 0:06:32,000
are actually willing and have the capacity to repay.

130
0:06:33.334,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Our credit scores have helped us deliver over 200,000 loans in Kenya

131
0:06:38.543,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in just the past year.

132
0:06:40.164,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And our repayment rates are above 90 percent --

133
0:06:43.49,000 --> 0:06:48,000
which, by the way, is in line with traditional bank repayment rates.

134
0:06:49.564,000 --> 0:06:51,000
With something as simple as a credit score,

135
0:06:52.497,000 --> 0:06:55,000
we're giving people the power to build their own futures.

136
0:06:56.647,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Our customers have used their loans for family expenses,

137
0:06:59.978,000 --> 0:07:,000
emergencies, travel

138
0:07:01.859,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and for investing back into growing their businesses.

139
0:07:05.792,000 --> 0:07:08,000
They're now building better economies and communities

140
0:07:09.288,000 --> 0:07:11,000
where more people can succeed.

141
0:07:12.664,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Over the past two years of using our product,

142
0:07:15.416,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Jenipher has increased her savings by 60 percent.

143
0:07:19.624,000 --> 0:07:21,000
She's also started two additional food stalls

144
0:07:22.3,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and is now making plans for her own restaurant.

145
0:07:25.401,000 --> 0:07:28,000
She's applying for a small-business loan from a commercial bank,

146
0:07:28.829,000 --> 0:07:32,000
because she now has the credit history to prove she deserves it.

147
0:07:34.038,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I saw Jenipher in Nairobi just last week,

148
0:07:36.977,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and she told me how excited she was to get started.

149
0:07:40.252,000 --> 0:07:41,000
She said,

150
0:07:42.178,000 --> 0:07:47,000
"Only my son believed I could do this. I didn't think this was for me."

151
0:07:48.25,000 --> 0:07:5,000
She's lived her whole life

152
0:07:50.56,000 --> 0:07:54,000
believing that there was a part of the world that was closed off to her.

153
0:07:55.536,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Our job now is to open the world to Jenipher

154
0:07:59.916,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and the billions like her that deserve to be trusted.

155
0:08:04.135,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Thank you.

156
0:08:05.318,000 --> 0:08:09,000
(Applause)

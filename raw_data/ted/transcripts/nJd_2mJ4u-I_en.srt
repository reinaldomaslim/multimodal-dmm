1
0:00:13.937,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Hello.

2
0:00:15.175,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'm not a real person.

3
0:00:17.119,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm actually a copy of a real person.

4
0:00:19.913,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Although, I feel like a real person.

5
0:00:22.49,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's kind of hard to explain.

6
0:00:24.42,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Hold on -- I think I saw a real person ... there's one.

7
0:00:28.697,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Let's bring him onstage.

8
0:00:33.307,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Hello.

9
0:00:35.485,000 --> 0:00:38,000
(Applause)

10
0:00:40.3,000 --> 0:00:43,000
What you see up there is a digital human.

11
0:00:43.99,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I'm wearing an inertial motion capture suit

12
0:00:46.998,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that's figuring what my body is doing.

13
0:00:49.601,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And I've got a single camera here that's watching my face

14
0:00:53.45,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and feeding some machine-learning software that's taking my expressions,

15
0:00:58.315,000 --> 0:01:01,000
like, "Hm, hm, hm,"

16
0:01:02.379,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and transferring it to that guy.

17
0:01:05.3,000 --> 0:01:08,000
We call him "DigiDoug."

18
0:01:09.292,000 --> 0:01:13,000
He's actually a 3-D character that I'm controlling live in real time.

19
0:01:16.292,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So, I work in visual effects.

20
0:01:19.101,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And in visual effects,

21
0:01:20.292,000 --> 0:01:25,000
one of the hardest things to do is to create believable, digital humans

22
0:01:26.227,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that the audience accepts as real.

23
0:01:28.433,000 --> 0:01:32,000
People are just really good at recognizing other people.

24
0:01:32.981,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Go figure!

25
0:01:35.577,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So, that's OK, we like a challenge.

26
0:01:39.006,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Over the last 15 years,

27
0:01:40.871,000 --> 0:01:44,000
we've been putting humans and creatures into film

28
0:01:45.878,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that you accept as real.

29
0:01:48.712,000 --> 0:01:5,000
If they're happy, you should feel happy.

30
0:01:51.982,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And if they feel pain, you should empathize with them.

31
0:01:58.467,000 --> 0:02:,000
We're getting pretty good at it, too.

32
0:02:00.681,000 --> 0:02:02,000
But it's really, really difficult.

33
0:02:03.847,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Effects like these take thousands of hours

34
0:02:07.085,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and hundreds of really talented artists.

35
0:02:10.792,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But things have changed.

36
0:02:13.014,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Over the last five years,

37
0:02:14.958,000 --> 0:02:18,000
computers and graphics cards have gotten seriously fast.

38
0:02:20.508,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And machine learning, deep learning, has happened.

39
0:02:25.408,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So we asked ourselves:

40
0:02:27.32,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Do you suppose we could create a photo-realistic human,

41
0:02:31.122,000 --> 0:02:32,000
like we're doing for film,

42
0:02:33.932,000 --> 0:02:38,000
but where you're seeing the actual emotions and the details

43
0:02:39.603,000 --> 0:02:43,000
of the person who's controlling the digital human

44
0:02:43.704,000 --> 0:02:44,000
in real time?

45
0:02:45.704,000 --> 0:02:46,000
In fact, that's our goal:

46
0:02:47.292,000 --> 0:02:5,000
If you were having a conversation with DigiDoug

47
0:02:51.077,000 --> 0:02:52,000
one-on-one,

48
0:02:53.331,000 --> 0:02:58,000
is it real enough so that you could tell whether or not I was lying to you?

49
0:02:59.934,000 --> 0:03:,000
So that was our goal.

50
0:03:02.601,000 --> 0:03:06,000
About a year and a half ago, we set off to achieve this goal.

51
0:03:06.641,000 --> 0:03:09,000
What I'm going to do now is take you basically on a little bit of a journey

52
0:03:10.564,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to see exactly what we had to do to get where we are.

53
0:03:15.832,000 --> 0:03:18,000
We had to capture an enormous amount of data.

54
0:03:20.347,000 --> 0:03:22,000
In fact, by the end of this thing,

55
0:03:23.085,000 --> 0:03:27,000
we had probably one of the largest facial data sets on the planet.

56
0:03:28.038,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Of my face.

57
0:03:29.744,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:32.03,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Why me?

59
0:03:33.324,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Well, I'll do just about anything for science.

60
0:03:36.158,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I mean, look at me!

61
0:03:38.625,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I mean, come on.

62
0:03:43.32,000 --> 0:03:48,000
We had to first figure out what my face actually looked like.

63
0:03:49.391,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Not just a photograph or a 3-D scan,

64
0:03:52.442,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but what it actually looked like in any photograph,

65
0:03:56.387,000 --> 0:03:58,000
how light interacts with my skin.

66
0:03:59.768,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Luckily for us, about three blocks away from our Los Angeles studio

67
0:04:05.041,000 --> 0:04:07,000
is this place called ICT.

68
0:04:07.708,000 --> 0:04:08,000
They're a research lab

69
0:04:09.004,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that's associated with the University of Southern California.

70
0:04:12.871,000 --> 0:04:15,000
They have a device there, it's called the "light stage."

71
0:04:16.45,000 --> 0:04:19,000
It has a zillion individually controlled lights

72
0:04:20.188,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and a whole bunch of cameras.

73
0:04:22.085,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And with that, we can reconstruct my face under a myriad of lighting conditions.

74
0:04:29.589,000 --> 0:04:3,000
We even captured the blood flow

75
0:04:31.195,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and how my face changes when I make expressions.

76
0:04:35.454,000 --> 0:04:4,000
This let us build a model of my face that, quite frankly, is just amazing.

77
0:04:41.399,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It's got an unfortunate level of detail, unfortunately.

78
0:04:45.756,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Laughter)

79
0:04:47.058,000 --> 0:04:5,000
You can see every pore, every wrinkle.

80
0:04:50.778,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But we had to have that.

81
0:04:52.96,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Reality is all about detail.

82
0:04:55.365,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And without it, you miss it.

83
0:04:58.793,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We are far from done, though.

84
0:05:01.363,000 --> 0:05:04,000
This let us build a model of my face that looked like me.

85
0:05:05.196,000 --> 0:05:07,000
But it didn't really move like me.

86
0:05:08.871,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And that's where machine learning comes in.

87
0:05:11.608,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And machine learning needs a ton of data.

88
0:05:15.497,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So I sat down in front of some high-resolution motion-capturing device.

89
0:05:20.45,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And also, we did this traditional motion capture with markers.

90
0:05:25.696,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We created a whole bunch of images of my face

91
0:05:28.696,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and moving point clouds that represented that shapes of my face.

92
0:05:33.996,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Man, I made a lot of expressions,

93
0:05:36.831,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I said different lines in different emotional states ...

94
0:05:40.315,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We had to do a lot of capture with this.

95
0:05:43.752,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Once we had this enormous amount of data,

96
0:05:46.667,000 --> 0:05:49,000
we built and trained deep neural networks.

97
0:05:51.117,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And when we were finished with that,

98
0:05:52.887,000 --> 0:05:54,000
in 16 milliseconds,

99
0:05:55.355,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the neural network can look at my image

100
0:05:58.491,000 --> 0:06:,000
and figure out everything about my face.

101
0:06:02.458,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It can compute my expression, my wrinkles, my blood flow --

102
0:06:07.958,000 --> 0:06:09,000
even how my eyelashes move.

103
0:06:10.925,000 --> 0:06:12,000
This is then rendered and displayed up there

104
0:06:13.784,000 --> 0:06:16,000
with all the detail that we captured previously.

105
0:06:18.077,000 --> 0:06:19,000
We're far from done.

106
0:06:20.188,000 --> 0:06:22,000
This is very much a work in progress.

107
0:06:22.419,000 --> 0:06:25,000
This is actually the first time we've shown it outside of our company.

108
0:06:25.764,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And, you know, it doesn't look as convincing as we want;

109
0:06:29.982,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I've got wires coming out of the back of me,

110
0:06:32.189,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and there's a sixth-of-a-second delay

111
0:06:34.251,000 --> 0:06:38,000
between when we capture the video and we display it up there.

112
0:06:38.642,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Sixth of a second -- that's crazy good!

113
0:06:41.911,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But it's still why you're hearing a bit of an echo and stuff.

114
0:06:46.104,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And you know, this machine learning stuff is brand-new to us,

115
0:06:50.017,000 --> 0:06:54,000
sometimes it's hard to convince to do the right thing, you know?

116
0:06:54.265,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It goes a little sideways.

117
0:06:56.347,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Laughter)

118
0:06:59.538,000 --> 0:07:02,000
But why did we do this?

119
0:07:03.077,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Well, there's two reasons, really.

120
0:07:05.363,000 --> 0:07:07,000
First of all, it is just crazy cool.

121
0:07:08.363,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Laughter)

122
0:07:09.395,000 --> 0:07:1,000
How cool is it?

123
0:07:10.99,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Well, with the push of a button,

124
0:07:13.006,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I can deliver this talk as a completely different character.

125
0:07:17.823,000 --> 0:07:19,000
This is Elbor.

126
0:07:22.037,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We put him together to test how this would work

127
0:07:24.373,000 --> 0:07:26,000
with a different appearance.

128
0:07:27.45,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And the cool thing about this technology is that, while I've changed my character,

129
0:07:32.292,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the performance is still all me.

130
0:07:35.589,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I tend to talk out of the right side of my mouth;

131
0:07:38.287,000 --> 0:07:39,000
so does Elbor.

132
0:07:39.89,000 --> 0:07:4,000
(Laughter)

133
0:07:42.021,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Now, the second reason we did this, and you can imagine,

134
0:07:44.835,000 --> 0:07:46,000
is this is going to be great for film.

135
0:07:47.195,000 --> 0:07:49,000
This is a brand-new, exciting tool

136
0:07:49.92,000 --> 0:07:53,000
for artists and directors and storytellers.

137
0:07:55.131,000 --> 0:07:56,000
It's pretty obvious, right?

138
0:07:56.639,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I mean, this is going to be really neat to have.

139
0:07:59.125,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But also, now that we've built it,

140
0:08:01.204,000 --> 0:08:03,000
it's clear that this is going to go way beyond film.

141
0:08:05.51,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But wait.

142
0:08:07.653,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Didn't I just change my identity with the push of a button?

143
0:08:11.653,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Isn't this like "deepfake" and face-swapping

144
0:08:14.71,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that you guys may have heard of?

145
0:08:17.208,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Well, yeah.

146
0:08:19.074,000 --> 0:08:21,000
In fact, we are using some of the same technology

147
0:08:22.05,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that deepfake is using.

148
0:08:23.954,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Deepfake is 2-D and image based, while ours is full 3-D

149
0:08:28.577,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and way more powerful.

150
0:08:31.204,000 --> 0:08:32,000
But they're very related.

151
0:08:33.68,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And now I can hear you thinking,

152
0:08:35.593,000 --> 0:08:36,000
"Darn it!

153
0:08:36.895,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I though I could at least trust and believe in video.

154
0:08:40.72,000 --> 0:08:42,000
If it was live video, didn't it have to be true?"

155
0:08:44.609,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Well, we know that's not really the case, right?

156
0:08:48.727,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Even without this, there are simple tricks that you can do with video

157
0:08:52.561,000 --> 0:08:54,000
like how you frame a shot

158
0:08:55.361,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that can make it really misrepresent what's actually going on.

159
0:09:00.263,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And I've been working in visual effects for a long time,

160
0:09:03.593,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and I've known for a long time

161
0:09:05.549,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that with enough effort, we can fool anyone about anything.

162
0:09:11.546,000 --> 0:09:13,000
What this stuff and deepfake is doing

163
0:09:13.958,000 --> 0:09:17,000
is making it easier and more accessible to manipulate video,

164
0:09:18.593,000 --> 0:09:23,000
just like Photoshop did for manipulating images, some time ago.

165
0:09:25.441,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I prefer to think about

166
0:09:26.763,000 --> 0:09:31,000
how this technology could bring humanity to other technology

167
0:09:31.823,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and bring us all closer together.

168
0:09:34.141,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Now that you've seen this,

169
0:09:36.524,000 --> 0:09:37,000
think about the possibilities.

170
0:09:39.81,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Right off the bat, you're going to see it in live events and concerts, like this.

171
0:09:45.612,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Digital celebrities, especially with new projection technology,

172
0:09:50.371,000 --> 0:09:53,000
are going to be just like the movies, but alive and in real time.

173
0:09:55.609,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And new forms of communication are coming.

174
0:09:59.088,000 --> 0:10:03,000
You can already interact with DigiDoug in VR.

175
0:10:03.699,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And it is eye-opening.

176
0:10:05.993,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It's just like you and I are in the same room,

177
0:10:09.879,000 --> 0:10:11,000
even though we may be miles apart.

178
0:10:12.276,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Heck, the next time you make a video call,

179
0:10:15.141,000 --> 0:10:18,000
you will be able to choose the version of you

180
0:10:18.901,000 --> 0:10:19,000
you want people to see.

181
0:10:20.974,000 --> 0:10:22,000
It's like really, really good makeup.

182
0:10:24.853,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I was scanned about a year and a half ago.

183
0:10:29.068,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I've aged.

184
0:10:30.813,000 --> 0:10:31,000
DigiDoug hasn't.

185
0:10:32.798,000 --> 0:10:35,000
On video calls, I never have to grow old.

186
0:10:38.322,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And as you can imagine, this is going to be used

187
0:10:41.434,000 --> 0:10:44,000
to give virtual assistants a body and a face.

188
0:10:44.671,000 --> 0:10:45,000
A humanity.

189
0:10:45.887,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I already love it that when I talk to virtual assistants,

190
0:10:48.673,000 --> 0:10:5,000
they answer back in a soothing, humanlike voice.

191
0:10:51.919,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Now they'll have a face.

192
0:10:53.719,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And you'll get all the nonverbal cues that make communication so much easier.

193
0:11:00.171,000 --> 0:11:01,000
It's going to be really nice.

194
0:11:01.615,000 --> 0:11:04,000
You'll be able to tell when a virtual assistant is busy or confused

195
0:11:05.276,000 --> 0:11:07,000
or concerned about something.

196
0:11:09.694,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Now, I couldn't leave the stage

197
0:11:12.227,000 --> 0:11:14,000
without you actually being able to see my real face,

198
0:11:14.949,000 --> 0:11:15,000
so you can do some comparison.

199
0:11:18.573,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So let me take off my helmet here.

200
0:11:20.473,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Yeah, don't worry, it looks way worse than it feels.

201
0:11:25.267,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Laughter)

202
0:11:29.188,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So this is where we are.

203
0:11:30.91,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Let me put this back on here.

204
0:11:32.538,000 --> 0:11:33,000
(Laughter)

205
0:11:35.115,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Doink!

206
0:11:37.292,000 --> 0:11:38,000
So this is where we are.

207
0:11:39.997,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We're on the cusp of being able to interact with digital humans

208
0:11:43.722,000 --> 0:11:45,000
that are strikingly real,

209
0:11:45.927,000 --> 0:11:48,000
whether they're being controlled by a person or a machine.

210
0:11:49.22,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And like all new technology these days,

211
0:11:54.531,000 --> 0:11:58,000
it's going to come with some serious and real concerns

212
0:11:59.301,000 --> 0:12:,000
that we have to deal with.

213
0:12:02.017,000 --> 0:12:04,000
But I am just so really excited

214
0:12:04.159,000 --> 0:12:09,000
about the ability to bring something that I've seen only in science fiction

215
0:12:09.236,000 --> 0:12:11,000
for my entire life

216
0:12:11.53,000 --> 0:12:12,000
into reality.

217
0:12:13.752,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Communicating with computers will be like talking to a friend.

218
0:12:18.323,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And talking to faraway friends

219
0:12:20.847,000 --> 0:12:23,000
will be like sitting with them together in the same room.

220
0:12:24.974,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Thank you very much.

221
0:12:26.306,000 --> 0:12:32,000
(Applause)

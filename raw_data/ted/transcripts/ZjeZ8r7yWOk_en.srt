1
0:00:12.815,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So, a little while ago,

2
0:00:14.891,000 --> 0:00:17,000
members of my family had three bits of minor surgery,

3
0:00:17.958,000 --> 0:00:18,000
about a half hour each,

4
0:00:19.547,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and we got three sets of bills.

5
0:00:22.011,000 --> 0:00:26,000
For the first one, the anesthesia bill alone was 2,000 dollars;

6
0:00:26.261,000 --> 0:00:28,000
the second one, 2,000 dollars;

7
0:00:28.665,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the third one, 6,000 dollars.

8
0:00:32.311,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So I'm a journalist. I'm like, what's up with that?

9
0:00:37.022,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I found out that I was actually, for the expensive one,

10
0:00:40.12,000 --> 0:00:45,000
being charged 1,419 dollars for a generic anti-nausea drug

11
0:00:45.963,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that I could buy online for two dollars and forty-nine cents.

12
0:00:50.782,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I had a long and unsatisfactory argument with the hospital,

13
0:00:53.921,000 --> 0:00:55,000
the insurer and my employer.

14
0:00:56.545,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Everybody agreed that this was totally fine.

15
0:00:59.855,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But it got me thinking, and the more I talked to people, the more I realized:

16
0:01:03.542,000 --> 0:01:05,000
nobody has any idea what stuff costs in health care.

17
0:01:06.273,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Not before, during or after that procedure or test

18
0:01:09.383,000 --> 0:01:11,000
do you have any idea what it's going to cost.

19
0:01:11.683,000 --> 0:01:14,000
It's only months later that you get an "explanation of benefits"

20
0:01:15.142,000 --> 0:01:17,000
that explains exactly nothing.

21
0:01:17.801,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So this came back to me a little while later.

22
0:01:20.429,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I had volunteered for a buyout from the New York Times,

23
0:01:23.059,000 --> 0:01:25,000
where I had worked for more than 20 years as a journalist.

24
0:01:26.254,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I was looking for my next act.

25
0:01:28.705,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It turned out that next act was to build a company

26
0:01:31.374,000 --> 0:01:33,000
telling people what stuff costs in health care.

27
0:01:34.128,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I won a "Shark Tank"-type pitch contest to do just that.

28
0:01:37.826,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Health costs ate up almost 18 percent of our gross domestic product last year,

29
0:01:42.122,000 --> 0:01:44,000
but nobody has any idea what stuff costs.

30
0:01:45.225,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But what if we did know?

31
0:01:48.145,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So we started out small.

32
0:01:49.828,000 --> 0:01:5,000
We called doctors and hospitals

33
0:01:51.597,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and asked them what they would accept as a cash payment for simple procedures.

34
0:01:57.075,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Some people were helpful.

35
0:01:58.889,000 --> 0:01:59,000
A lot of people hung up on us.

36
0:02:00.766,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Some people were just plain rude.

37
0:02:02.901,000 --> 0:02:03,000
They said, "We don't know,"

38
0:02:04.847,000 --> 0:02:06,000
or, "Our lawyers won't let us tell you that,"

39
0:02:07.899,000 --> 0:02:08,000
though we did get a lot of information.

40
0:02:10.207,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We found, for example, that here in the New York area,

41
0:02:12.905,000 --> 0:02:16,000
you could get an echocardiogram for 200 dollars in Brooklyn

42
0:02:17.019,000 --> 0:02:21,000
or for 2,150 dollars in Manhattan, just a few miles away.

43
0:02:22.961,000 --> 0:02:24,000
New Orleans, the same simple blood test,

44
0:02:25.504,000 --> 0:02:27,000
19 dollars over here,

45
0:02:27.8,000 --> 0:02:3,000
522 dollars just a few blocks away.

46
0:02:31.755,000 --> 0:02:33,000
San Francisco, the same MRI,

47
0:02:34.494,000 --> 0:02:36,000
475 dollars

48
0:02:36.835,000 --> 0:02:4,000
or 6,221 dollars just 25 miles away.

49
0:02:42.822,000 --> 0:02:45,000
These pricing variations existed for all the procedures

50
0:02:46.114,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and all the cities that we surveyed.

51
0:02:49.165,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Then we started to ask people to tell us their health bills.

52
0:02:52.512,000 --> 0:02:55,000
In partnership with public radio station WNYC here in New York,

53
0:02:56.289,000 --> 0:02:58,000
we asked women to tell us the prices of their mammograms.

54
0:02:59.624,000 --> 0:03:02,000
People told us nobody would do that, that it was too personal.

55
0:03:03.49,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But in the space of three weeks,

56
0:03:05.293,000 --> 0:03:08,000
400 women told us about their prices.

57
0:03:09.272,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Then we started to make it easier for people to share their data

58
0:03:12.38,000 --> 0:03:14,000
into our online searchable database.

59
0:03:15.106,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It's sort of like a mash-up of Kayak.com and the Waze traffic app for health care.

60
0:03:20.268,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Laughter)

61
0:03:21.341,000 --> 0:03:23,000
We call it a community-created guide to health costs.

62
0:03:24.272,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Our survey and crowdsourcing work grew into partnerships

63
0:03:26.931,000 --> 0:03:27,000
with top newsrooms nationwide --

64
0:03:28.821,000 --> 0:03:3,000
in New Orleans, Philadelphia,

65
0:03:30.917,000 --> 0:03:33,000
San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami and other places.

66
0:03:35.212,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We used the data to tell stories about people who were suffering

67
0:03:39.159,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and how to avoid that suffering, to avoid that "gotcha" bill.

68
0:03:44.579,000 --> 0:03:47,000
A woman in New Orleans saved nearly 4,000 dollars using our data.

69
0:03:49.147,000 --> 0:03:52,000
A San Francisco contributor saved nearly 1,300 dollars

70
0:03:52.482,000 --> 0:03:53,000
by putting away his insurance card

71
0:03:54.307,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and paying cash.

72
0:03:56.513,000 --> 0:03:59,000
There are a lot of people who are going to in-network hospitals

73
0:03:59.565,000 --> 0:04:,000
and getting out-of-network bills.

74
0:04:01.838,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And then there was the hospital that continued to bill a dead man.

75
0:04:05.071,000 --> 0:04:08,000
We learned that thousands of people wanted to tell us their prices.

76
0:04:08.247,000 --> 0:04:09,000
They want to learn what stuff costs,

77
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:11,000
find out how to argue a bill,

78
0:04:11.658,000 --> 0:04:15,000
help us solve this problem that's hurting them and their friends and families.

79
0:04:15.952,000 --> 0:04:17,000
We talked to people who had to sell a car to pay a health bill,

80
0:04:18.952,000 --> 0:04:19,000
go into bankruptcy,

81
0:04:20.363,000 --> 0:04:22,000
skip a treatment because of the cost.

82
0:04:23.23,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Imagine if you could afford the diagnosis

83
0:04:25.914,000 --> 0:04:26,000
but not the cure.

84
0:04:29.589,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We set off a huge conversation about costs

85
0:04:31.775,000 --> 0:04:34,000
involving doctors and hospitals, yes, but also their patients,

86
0:04:35.55,000 --> 0:04:37,000
or as we like to call them, people.

87
0:04:37.765,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:41.519,000 --> 0:04:42,000
We changed policy.

89
0:04:42.694,000 --> 0:04:44,000
A consumer protection bill that had been stalled

90
0:04:45.044,000 --> 0:04:47,000
in the Louisiana legislature for 10 years

91
0:04:47.191,000 --> 0:04:48,000
passed after we launched.

92
0:04:50.797,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Let's face it:

93
0:04:51.972,000 --> 0:04:53,000
this huge, slow-rolling public health crisis

94
0:04:54.391,000 --> 0:04:55,000
is a national emergency.

95
0:04:56.649,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And I don't think government's going to help us out anytime soon.

96
0:05:00.652,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But what if the answer was really simple:

97
0:05:02.824,000 --> 0:05:05,000
make all the prices public all the time.

98
0:05:06.605,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Would our individual bills go down? Our health premiums?

99
0:05:11.749,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Be really clear about this:

100
0:05:13.495,000 --> 0:05:14,000
this is a United States problem.

101
0:05:15.429,000 --> 0:05:17,000
In most of the rest of the developed world,

102
0:05:17.508,000 --> 0:05:19,000
sick people don't have to worry about money.

103
0:05:20.291,000 --> 0:05:24,000
It's also true that price transparency will not solve every problem.

104
0:05:24.333,000 --> 0:05:26,000
There will still be expensive treatments,

105
0:05:27.163,000 --> 0:05:29,000
huge friction from our insurance system.

106
0:05:29.879,000 --> 0:05:3,000
There will still be fraud

107
0:05:31.583,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and a massive problem with overtreatment and overdiagnosis.

108
0:05:35.537,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And not everything is shoppable.

109
0:05:38.176,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Not everybody wants the cheapest appendectomy

110
0:05:40.654,000 --> 0:05:41,000
or the cheapest cancer care.

111
0:05:43.513,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But when we talk about these clear effects,

112
0:05:45.692,000 --> 0:05:48,000
we're looking at a real issue that's actually very simple.

113
0:05:50.394,000 --> 0:05:51,000
When we first started calling for prices,

114
0:05:52.372,000 --> 0:05:54,000
we actually felt like we were going to be arrested.

115
0:05:55.162,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It seemed kind of transgressive to talk about medicine and health care

116
0:05:58.778,000 --> 0:05:59,000
in the same breath,

117
0:06:00.147,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and yet it became liberating,

118
0:06:01.723,000 --> 0:06:03,000
because we found not only data

119
0:06:04.059,000 --> 0:06:06,000
but also good and honest people out there in the system

120
0:06:06.724,000 --> 0:06:08,000
who want to help folks get the care they need

121
0:06:08.892,000 --> 0:06:09,000
at a price they can afford.

122
0:06:11.631,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And it got easier to ask.

123
0:06:13.53,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So I'll leave you with some questions.

124
0:06:15.635,000 --> 0:06:18,000
What if we all knew what stuff cost in health care in advance?

125
0:06:19.983,000 --> 0:06:22,000
What if, every time you Googled for an MRI,

126
0:06:23.194,000 --> 0:06:26,000
you got drop-downs telling you where to buy and for how much,

127
0:06:26.618,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the way you do when you Google for a laser printer?

128
0:06:30.094,000 --> 0:06:34,000
What if all of the time and energy and money that's spent hiding prices

129
0:06:34.362,000 --> 0:06:35,000
was squeezed out of the system?

130
0:06:37.188,000 --> 0:06:4,000
What if each one of us could pick the $19 test every time

131
0:06:40.411,000 --> 0:06:42,000
instead of the $522 one?

132
0:06:43.384,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Would our individual bills go down?

133
0:06:45.146,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Our premiums?

134
0:06:46.573,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I don't know, but if you don't ask, you'll never know.

135
0:06:49.445,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And you might save a ton of money.

136
0:06:51.767,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And I've got to think that a lot of us and the system itself

137
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
would be a lot healthier.

138
0:06:57.676,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Thank you.

139
0:06:58.888,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Applause)

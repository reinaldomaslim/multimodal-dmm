1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So I understand that this meeting was planned,

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and the slogan was From Was to Still.

3
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And I am illustrating Still.

4
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Which, of course, I am not agreeing with because,

5
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
although I am 94, I am not still working.

6
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And anybody who asks me, "Are you still doing this or that?"

7
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I don't answer because I'm not doing things still, I'm doing it like I always did.

8
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I still have -- or did I use the word still? I didn't mean that.

9
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I have my file which is called To Do. I have my plans.

11
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I have my clients. I am doing my work like I always did.

12
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So this takes care of my age.

13
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I want to show you my work so you know what I am doing and why I am here.

14
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
This was about 1925.

15
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
All of these things were made during the last 75 years.

16
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Applause)

18
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But, of course, I'm working since 25,

19
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
doing more or less what you see here. This is Castleton China.

20
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
This was an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.

21
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
This is now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum.

22
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
This is still at the Metropolitan Museum now for sale.

23
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
This is a portrait of my daughter and myself.

24
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Applause)

25
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
These were just some of the things I've made.

26
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I made hundreds of them for the last 75 years.

27
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I call myself a maker of things.

28
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I don't call myself an industrial designer because I'm other things.

29
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Industrial designers want to make novel things.

30
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
Novelty is a concept of commerce, not an aesthetic concept.

31
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The industrial design magazine, I believe, is called "Innovation."

32
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Innovation is not part of the aim of my work.

33
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Well, makers of things: they make things more beautiful, more elegant,

34
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
more comfortable than just the craftsmen do.

35
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I have so much to say. I have to think what I am going to say.

36
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Well, to describe our profession otherwise,

37
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
we are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty.

38
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
That means the playful search for beauty was called the first activity of Man.

39
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Sarah Smith, who was a mathematics professor at MIT, wrote,

40
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
"The playful search for beauty was Man's first activity --

41
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that all useful qualities and all material qualities

42
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
were developed from the playful search for beauty."

43
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
These are tiles. The word, "playful" is a necessary aspect of our work

44
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
because, actually, one of our problems is that we have to make,

45
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
produce, lovely things throughout all of life, and this for me is now 75 years.

46
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So how can you, without drying up,

47
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
make things with the same pleasure, as a gift to others, for so long?

48
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The playful is therefore an important part of our quality as designer.

49
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Let me tell you some about my life.

50
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
As I said, I started to do these things 75 years ago.

51
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
My first exhibition in the United States

52
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
was at the Sesquicentennial exhibition in 1926 --

53
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that the Hungarian government sent one of my hand-drawn pieces as part of the exhibit.

54
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
My work actually took me through many countries,

55
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and showed me a great part of the world.

56
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
This is not that they took me -- the work didn't take me --

57
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I made the things particularly because I wanted to use them to see the world.

58
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I was incredibly curious to see the world, and I made all these things,

59
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
which then finally did take me to see many countries and many cultures.

60
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I started as an apprentice to a Hungarian craftsman,

61
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and this taught me what the guild system was in Middle Ages.

62
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The guild system: that means when I was an apprentice,

63
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I had to apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master.

64
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
In my shop where I studied, or learned, there was a traditional hierarchy

65
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
of master, journeyman and learned worker, and apprentice,

66
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and I worked as the apprentice.

67
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The work as an apprentice was very primitive.

68
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
That means I had to actually learn every aspect of making pottery by hand.

69
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
We mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside.

70
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
After that, it had to be kneaded. It had to then go in, kind of, a mangle.

71
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And then finally it was prepared for the throwing.

72
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And there I really worked as an apprentice.

73
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
My master took me to set ovens

74
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
because this was part of oven-making, oven-setting, in the time.

75
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And finally, I had received a document

76
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that I had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully,

77
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
that I had behaved morally, and this document was given to me

78
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
by the Guild of Roof-Coverers, Rail-Diggers, Oven-Setters,

79
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Chimney Sweeps and Potters.

80
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
(Laughter)

81
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights

82
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and my working conditions, and I still have that workbook.

83
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
First I set up a shop in my own garden,

84
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and made pottery which I sold on the marketplace in Budapest.

85
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And there I was sitting, and my then-boyfriend --

86
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I didn't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today --

87
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
but my boyfriend and I sat at the market and sold the pots.

88
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
My mother thought that this was not very proper,

89
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
so she sat with us to add propriety to this activity.

90
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Laughter)

91
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
However, after a while there was a new factory being built in Budapest,

92
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
a pottery factory, a large one.

93
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And I visited it with several ladies, and asked all sorts of questions of the director.

94
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Then the director asked me, why do you ask all these questions?

95
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I said, I also have a pottery.

96
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So he asked me, could he please visit me, and then finally he did,

97
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and explained to me that what I did now in my shop was an anachronism,

98
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that the industrial revolution had broken out,

99
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and that I rather should join the factory.

100
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
There he made an art department for me where I worked for several months.

101
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
However, everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department.

102
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
The director there said there were several women casting

103
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and producing my designs now in molds, and this was sold also to America.

104
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I remember that it was quite successful.

105
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
However, the director, the chemist, model maker -- everybody --

106
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
concerned himself much more with the art department --

107
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that means, with my work -- than making toilets,

108
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
so finally they got a letter from the center, from the bank who owned the factory,

109
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
saying, make toilet-setting behind the art department, and that was my end.

110
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
So this gave me the possibility because now I was a journeyman,

111
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and journeymen also take their satchel and go to see the world.

112
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So as a journeyman, I put an ad into the paper that I had studied,

113
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that I was a down-to-earth potter's journeyman

114
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and I was looking for a job as a journeyman.

115
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And I got several answers, and I accepted the one

116
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
which was farthest from home and practically, I thought, halfway to America.

117
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And that was in Hamburg.

118
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Then I first took this job in Hamburg, at an art pottery

119
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
where everything was done on the wheel,

120
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and so I worked in a shop where there were several potters.

121
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And the first day, I was coming to take my place at the turntable --

122
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
there were three or four turntables -- and one of them, behind where I was sitting,

123
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
was a hunchback, a deaf-mute hunchback, who smelled very bad.

124
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So I doused him in cologne every day, which he thought was very nice,

125
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and therefore he brought bread and butter every day,

126
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
which I had to eat out of courtesy.

127
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
The first day I came to work in this shop

128
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
there was on my wheel a surprise for me.

129
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
My colleagues had thoughtfully put on the wheel where I was supposed to work

130
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
a very nicely modeled natural man's organs.

131
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
(Laughter)

132
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
After I brushed them off with a hand motion, they were very --

133
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
I finally was now accepted, and worked there for some six months.

134
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
This was my first job.

135
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
If I go on like this, you will be here till midnight.

136
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
(Laughter)

137
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
(Applause)

138
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
So I will try speed it up a little

139
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
(Laughter)

140
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Moderator: Eva, we have about five minutes.

141
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
(Laughter)

142
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Eva Zeisel: Are you sure?

143
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Moderator: Yes, I am sure.

144
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
EZ: Well, if you are sure,

145
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I have to tell you that within five minutes I will talk very fast.

146
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And actually, my work took me to many countries

147
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
because I used my work to fill my curiosity.

148
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
And among other things, other countries I worked, was in the Soviet Union,

149
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
where I worked from '32 to '37 -- actually, to '36.

150
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
I was finally there, although I had nothing to do -- I was a foreign expert.

151
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
I became art director of the china and glass industry,

152
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and eventually under Stalin's purges -- at the beginning of Stalin's purges,

153
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
I didn't know that hundreds of thousands of innocent people were arrested.

154
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
So I was arrested quite early in Stalin's purges,

155
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and spent 16 months in a Russian prison.

156
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
The accusation was that I had successfully prepared an Attentat on Stalin's life.

157
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
This was a very dangerous accusation.

158
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And if this is the end of my five minutes, I want to tell you that

159
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
I actually did survive, which was a surprise.

160
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
But since I survived and I'm here,

161
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
and since this is the end of the five minutes, I will --

162
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Moderator: Tell me when your last trip to Russia was.

163
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Weren't you there recently?

164
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
EZ: Oh, this summer, in fact,

165
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
the Lomonosov factory was bought by an American company, invited me.

166
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:51,000
They found out that I had worked in '33 at this factory,

167
0:16:51.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and they came to my studio in Rockland County,

168
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and brought the 15 of their artists to visit me here.

169
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:1,000
And they invited myself to come to the Russian factory last summer,

170
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
in July, to make some dishes, design some dishes.

171
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:23,000
And since I don't like to travel alone, they also invited my daughter,

172
0:17:23.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
son-in-law and granddaughter,

173
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
so we had a lovely trip to see Russia today,

174
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
which is not a very pleasant and happy view.

175
0:17:35.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
Here I am now, if this is the end? Thank you.

176
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
(Applause)

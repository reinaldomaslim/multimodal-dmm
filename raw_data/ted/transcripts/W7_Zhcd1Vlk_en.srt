1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
You know, I am so bad at tech

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that my daughter -- who is now 41 --

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
when she was five, was overheard by me

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
to say to a friend of hers,

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
If it doesn't bleed when you cut it,

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
my daddy doesn't understand it.

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So, the assignment I've been given

9
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
may be an insuperable obstacle for me,

10
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
but I'm certainly going to try.

11
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
What have I heard

12
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
during these last four days?

13
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
This is my third visit to TED.

14
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
One was to TEDMED, and one, as you've heard,

15
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
was a regular TED two years ago.

16
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I've heard what I consider an extraordinary thing

17
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that I've only heard a little bit in the two previous TEDs,

18
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and what that is is an interweaving

19
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
and an interlarding, an intermixing,

20
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
of a sense of social responsibility

21
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
in so many of the talks --

22
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
global responsibility, in fact,

23
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
appealing to enlightened self-interest,

24
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but it goes far beyond enlightened self-interest.

25
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
One of the most impressive things

26
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
about what some, perhaps 10,

27
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
of the speakers have been talking about

28
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
is the realization, as you listen to them carefully, that they're not saying:

29
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Well, this is what we should do; this is what I would like you to do.

30
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
It's: This is what I have done

31
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
because I'm excited by it,

32
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
because it's a wonderful thing, and it's done something for me

33
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and, of course, it's accomplished a great deal.

34
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It's the old concept, the real Greek concept,

35
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
of philanthropy in its original sense:

36
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
phil-anthropy, the love of humankind.

37
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And the only explanation I can have

38
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
for some of what you've been hearing in the last four days

39
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
is that it arises, in fact, out of a form of love.

40
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And this gives me enormous hope.

41
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And hope, of course, is the topic

42
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that I'm supposed to be speaking about,

43
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
which I'd completely forgotten about until I arrived.

44
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And when I did, I thought,

45
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
well, I'd better look this word up in the dictionary.

46
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So, Sarah and I -- my wife -- walked over to the public library,

47
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
which is four blocks away, on Pacific Street, and we got the OED,

48
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and we looked in there, and there are 14 definitions of hope,

49
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
none of which really hits you

50
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
between the eyes as being the appropriate one.

51
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And, of course, that makes sense,

52
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
because hope is an abstract phenomenon; it's an abstract idea,

53
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
it's not a concrete word.

54
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Well, it reminds me a little bit of surgery.

55
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
If there's one operation for a disease, you know it works.

56
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
If there are 15 operations, you know that none of them work.

57
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And that's the way it is with definitions of words.

58
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
If you have appendicitis, they take your appendix out, and you're cured.

59
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
If you've got reflux oesophagitis, there are 15 procedures,

60
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and Joe Schmo does it one way

61
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and Will Blow does it another way,

62
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and none of them work, and that's the way it is with this word, hope.

63
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
They all come down to the idea of an expectation

64
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
of something good that is due to happen.

65
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And you know what I found out?

66
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
The Indo-European root of the word hope

67
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
is a stem, K-E-U --

68
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
we would spell it K-E-U; it's pronounced koy --

69
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from.

70
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
But what it means in the original Indo-European

71
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
is a change in direction, going in a different way.

72
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And I find that very interesting and very provocative,

73
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
because what you've been hearing in the last couple of days

74
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
is the sense of going in different directions:

75
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
directions that are specific and unique to problems.

76
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
There are different paradigms.

77
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You've heard that word several times in the last four days,

78
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and everyone's familiar with Kuhnian paradigms.

79
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So, when we think of hope now,

80
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
we have to think of looking in other directions

81
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
than we have been looking.

82
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
There's another -- not definition, but description, of hope

83
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that has always appealed to me, and it was one by Václav Havel

84
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
in his perfectly spectacular book "Breaking the Peace,"

85
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
in which he says that hope

86
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
does not consist of the expectation that things will

87
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
come out exactly right,

88
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
but the expectation that they will make sense

89
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
regardless of how they come out.

90
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I can't tell you how reassured I was

91
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
by the very last sentence

92
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
in that glorious presentation by Dean Kamen a few days ago.

93
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I wasn't sure I heard it right,

94
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
so I found him in one of the inter-sessions.

95
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
He was talking to a very large man, but I didn't care.

96
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I interrupted, and I said, "Did you say this?"

97
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
He said, "I think so."

98
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So, here's what it is: I'll repeat it.

99
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
"The world will not be saved by the Internet."

100
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It's wonderful. Do you know what the world will be saved by?

101
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I'll tell you. It'll be saved by the human spirit.

102
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And by the human spirit, I don't mean anything divine,

103
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I don't mean anything supernatural --

104
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
certainly not coming from this skeptic.

105
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
What I mean is this ability

106
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that each of us has

107
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to be something greater than herself or himself;

108
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something

109
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not capable of.

110
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
On an elemental level, we have all felt

111
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
that spirituality at the time of childbirth.

112
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Some of you have felt it in laboratories;

113
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
some of you have felt it at the workbench.

114
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We feel it at concerts.

115
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I've felt it in the operating room, at the bedside.

116
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
It is an elevation of us beyond ourselves.

117
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And I think that it's going to be, in time,

118
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the elements of the human spirit that we've been hearing about

119
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days.

120
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And if there's anything that has permeated this room,

121
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
it is precisely that.

122
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I'm intrigued by

123
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
a concept that was brought to life

124
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
in the early part of the 19th century --

125
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
actually, in the second decade of the 19th century --

126
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
by a 27-year-old poet

127
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
whose name was Percy Shelley.

128
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Now, we all think that Shelley

129
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
obviously is the great romantic poet that he was;

130
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
many of us tend to forget that he wrote

131
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
some perfectly wonderful essays, too,

132
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and the most well-remembered essay

133
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
is one called "A Defence of Poetry."

134
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Now, it's about five, six, seven, eight pages long,

135
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page,

136
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
but somewhere on the second page

137
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
he begins talking about the notion

138
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that he calls "moral imagination."

139
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And here's what he says, roughly translated:

140
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
A man -- generic man --

141
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
a man, to be greatly good,

142
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
must imagine clearly.

143
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
He must see himself and the world

144
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
through the eyes of another,

145
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and of many others.

146
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
See himself and the world -- not just the world, but see himself.

147
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
What is it that is expected of us

148
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
by the billions of people

149
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
who live in what Laurie Garrett the other day

150
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
so appropriately called

151
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
despair and disparity?

152
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
What is it that they have every right

153
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to ask of us?

154
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
What is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves,

155
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
out of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit?

156
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Well, you know precisely what it is.

157
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
There's a great deal of argument

158
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
about whether we, as the great nation that we are,

159
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
should be the policeman of the world,

160
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
the world's constabulary,

161
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
but there should be virtually no argument

162
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
about whether we should be the world's healer.

163
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
There has certainly been no argument about that

164
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
in this room in the past four days.

165
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So, if we are to be the world's healer,

166
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
every disadvantaged person in this world --

167
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
including in the United States -- becomes our patient.

168
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Every disadvantaged nation, and perhaps our own nation,

169
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
becomes our patient.

170
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So, it's fun to think about the etymology of the word "patient."

171
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
It comes initially from the Latin patior, to endure, or to suffer.

172
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So, you go back to the old Indo-European root again,

173
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and what do you find? The Indo-European stem is pronounced payen --

174
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
we would spell it P-A-E-N -- and, lo and behold, mirabile dictu,

175
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
it is the same root as the word compassion comes from, P-A-E-N.

176
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So, the lesson is very clear. The lesson is that our patient --

177
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the world, and the disadvantaged of the world --

178
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that patient deserves our compassion.

179
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But beyond our compassion, and far greater than compassion,

180
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
is our moral imagination

181
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and our identification with each individual

182
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
who lives in that world,

183
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
not to think of them as a huge forest,

184
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
but as individual trees.

185
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Of course, in this day and age, the trick is not to let each tree

186
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
be obscured by that Bush in Washington that can get --

187
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
can get in the way.

188
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Laughter)

189
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So, here we are.

190
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
We are, should be,

191
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
morally committed to

192
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
being the healer of the world.

193
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And we have had examples over and over and over again --

194
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
you've just heard one in the last 15 minutes --

195
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
of people who have not only had that commitment,

196
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
but had the charisma, the brilliance --

197
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and I think in this room it's easy to use the word brilliant, my God --

198
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
the brilliance to succeed at least at the beginning

199
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
of their quest,

200
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and who no doubt will continue to succeed,

201
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
as long as more and more of us enlist ourselves in their cause.

202
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Now, if we're talking

203
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
about medicine,

204
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and we're talking about healing,

205
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I'd like to quote someone who hasn't been quoted.

206
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
It seems to me everybody in the world's been quoted here:

207
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Pogo's been quoted;

208
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Shakespeare's been quoted backwards, forwards, inside out.

209
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I would like to quote one of my own household gods.

210
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I suspect he never really said this,

211
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
because we don't know what Hippocrates really said,

212
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
but we do know for sure that one of the great Greek physicians

213
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
said the following,

214
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and it has been recorded in one of the books attributed to Hippocrates,

215
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and the book is called "Precepts."

216
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And I'll read you what it is.

217
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Remember, I have been talking about,

218
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
essentially philanthropy:

219
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
the love of humankind, the individual humankind

220
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and the individual humankind

221
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
that can bring that kind of love

222
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
translated into action,

223
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
translated, in some cases, into enlightened self-interest.

224
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And here he is, 2,400 years ago:

225
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
"Where there is love of humankind,

226
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
there is love of healing."

227
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
We have seen that here today

228
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
with the sense,

229
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
with the sensitivity --

230
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and in the last three days,

231
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and with the power of the indomitable human spirit.

232
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Thank you very much.

233
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
[SHIT]

2
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
This is arguably the back end of the design of animals.

3
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But the reason I put this up here is because

5
0:00:28.604,000 --> 0:00:32,000
when I was in Africa last year, my wife and I were driving around,

6
0:00:32.739,000 --> 0:00:34,000
we had this wonderful guide,

7
0:00:34.985,000 --> 0:00:37,000
who showed us something that surprised both of us,

8
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and it was very revealing in terms of the fascination

9
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that comes with the design of animals.

10
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It turns out that in about the 1880s, the missionaries came to Africa

11
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to spread the word of Christianity,

12
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to teach English to the natives.

13
0:00:51.161,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And they brought blackboards and chalk.

14
0:00:54.078,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And I'd like you to imagine that that's a blackboard,

15
0:00:56.655,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and I just used some chalk on there.

16
0:00:58.501,000 --> 0:01:,000
And they brought quite a bit of this stuff.

17
0:01:01.005,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But over the years, the blackboards were fine,

18
0:01:03.587,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but they ran out of chalk.

19
0:01:05.588,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And this is a real crisis for them.

20
0:01:07.751,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And that's where the hyena comes in.

21
0:01:10.878,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The hyena is probably the most perfectly designed

22
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
scavenging animal in the world.

23
0:01:15.161,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It strip-mines carcasses, and it has amazing teeth,

24
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
because it enables the hyena to essentially eat bones.

25
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Now, the end product of that action is up on the board here.

26
0:01:29.911,000 --> 0:01:33,000
What the missionaries would do is, they'd walk around

27
0:01:35.197,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and they'd pick up hyena shit.

28
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And the incredible thing about hyena shit is, it makes great chalk.

29
0:01:41.119,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:42.239,000 --> 0:01:43,000
That's not what I'm here to talk about,

31
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
but it is a fascinating aspect of animal design.

32
0:01:48.795,000 --> 0:01:5,000
What I'm here to talk about is the camel.

33
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
When I started talking to Richard

34
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
about what I was going to speak about,

35
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I had recently come back from Jordan,

36
0:01:57.808,000 --> 0:02:,000
where I had an amazing experience with a camel.

37
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And we were in the desert.

39
0:02:05.605,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Richard Wurman: That's the end! Keith Bellows: Yeah, yeah.

40
0:02:08.446,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We were in the desert, in Wadi Rum, in a small Jeep.

41
0:02:11.715,000 --> 0:02:13,000
There were four of us, two Bedouin drivers.

42
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
You can just imagine, this expanse is an ocean of sand,

43
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
105 degrees, one water bottle.

44
0:02:20.858,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And we were driving in what they told us was their very, very best Jeep.

45
0:02:26.342,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Didn't look like it to me.

46
0:02:28.786,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And as we started to go through the desert,

47
0:02:32.855,000 --> 0:02:33,000
the Jeep broke down.

48
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The guys got out, they put the hood up,

49
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
they started working under the hood, got it going again.

50
0:02:38.859,000 --> 0:02:39,000
About a hundred yards, it broke down.

51
0:02:40.653,000 --> 0:02:43,000
This went on about 6-7 times, we were getting more and more alarmed,

52
0:02:43.954,000 --> 0:02:45,000
we were also getting deeper and deeper into the desert.

53
0:02:46.636,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And eventually, our worst nightmare happened:

54
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
they flooded the engine.

55
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And they said, "Ah, no problem! We just get out and walk."

56
0:02:55.355,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And we said, "We get out and walk?"

57
0:02:57.161,000 --> 0:02:59,000
One water bottle, remember, guys, four people.

58
0:02:59.437,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And they said, "Yeah, yeah, we'll walk. We'll find some camels."

59
0:03:03.104,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We got out and walked, and sure enough,

60
0:03:05.081,000 --> 0:03:07,000
about half a mile, we came over the crest of this hill,

61
0:03:07.715,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and there was a huge gathering of Bedouin with their camels.

62
0:03:10.637,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The guy went up and started dickering,

63
0:03:12.556,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and 10 dollars later, we had four camels.

64
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
They went down like elevators; we got on them.

65
0:03:17.702,000 --> 0:03:2,000
They went back up, and the Bedouin, each Bedouin, four of them,

66
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
got behind each of the camels with a little whip.

67
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And they started slashing away at the back of the camels,

68
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and they started galloping.

69
0:03:28.476,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And if you've ever been on a camel, it is a very, very uncomfortable ride.

70
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
There's also one other aspect about these camels.

71
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
About every 10 steps, they lean back

72
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and try to take a chunk out of your leg.

73
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:40.263,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So we kept on going,

75
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and this camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg.

76
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And eventually, three miles later, we arrived at our destination,

77
0:03:48.318,000 --> 0:03:49,000
where a Jeep was supposed to meet us.

78
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And the camels come down again like elevators,

79
0:03:52.636,000 --> 0:03:53,000
we sort of clumsily get off,

80
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and they, obviously, try to take another chunk out of my leg.

81
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And I've developed a very wonderful relationship

82
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
with this creature by this point,

83
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and I've realized that this is a mean son of a bitch.

84
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And much meaner, by the way, than the Bedouin who greeted me

85
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and tried to sell me one of his 26 daughters

86
0:04:11.724,000 --> 0:04:12,000
to take back to the States.

87
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So as we talked, Richard and I,

88
0:04:16.058,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I said, "You know, maybe I should bring a camel.

89
0:04:18.343,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It's the best designed animal in the world."

90
0:04:20.6,000 --> 0:04:22,000
He went, "Nah. I don't think we want to be bringing a camel."

91
0:04:23.508,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel.

92
0:04:26.669,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So I did the next best thing.

93
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I went to the Washington Zoo.

94
0:04:31.145,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Richard said, "I want you to get up close and personal with this camel.

95
0:04:35.729,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I want you to inspect its mouth, look at its teeth.

96
0:04:38.697,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Go underneath it. Go above it. Go around it.

97
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Pull its tail up; take a look in there.

98
0:04:43.898,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can."

99
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So, I got a National Geographic film crew.

100
0:04:50.826,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We went down there, and I took one look at this camel.

101
0:04:56.542,000 --> 0:05:,000
It is a 2,000 pound creature who is in rut.

102
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:03.978,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Now, if you've ever seen a 2,000 pound camel in rut,

104
0:05:06.859,000 --> 0:05:08,000
it is a scary, scary thing to behold.

105
0:05:10.017,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And if Richard thought I was getting in the ring with that camel,

106
0:05:13.707,000 --> 0:05:15,000
someone was smoking Bedouin high grade.

107
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:17.366,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So we got as close to it as possible,

109
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and I'm going to share this.

110
0:05:22.526,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Chris, if you want to roll this film.

111
0:05:24.319,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Then I'm going to show you

112
0:05:25.597,000 --> 0:05:27,000
a little bit more about the design of camels.

113
0:05:27.717,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Do you want to roll the film?

114
0:05:29.447,000 --> 0:05:31,000
(Adventure music)

115
0:06:04.365,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Video) Hello. This is Keith Bellows

116
0:06:06.125,000 --> 0:06:09,000
with the TED National Geographic Camel Investigation Unit.

117
0:06:09.643,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I'm here to look at the ultimate desert machine.

118
0:06:13.076,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Music continues)

119
0:06:20.072,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Keith Bellows: And you'll note I started chewing gum

120
0:06:22.589,000 --> 0:06:23,000
because I was around this camel all day.

121
0:06:25.124,000 --> 0:06:26,000
(Video) That's it, OK. No!

122
0:06:27.787,000 --> 0:06:29,000
See, now he's getting a little overexcited.

123
0:06:29.841,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So we'll need to be very careful around him. Don't let him get you.

124
0:06:55.334,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Now, you can see copious amounts of saliva in there.

125
0:07:02.436,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I always called myself the unstable stable boy.

126
0:07:05.584,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Their nose, you can see his nose is flared right now.

127
0:07:09.445,000 --> 0:07:12,000
When they're in rut, they're similar to seals

128
0:07:12.931,000 --> 0:07:15,000
in the way, like, a seal has to open its nose to breathe.

129
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And they're similar. They have to consciously open their nose.

130
0:07:21.147,000 --> 0:07:22,000
KB: Ears?

131
0:07:22.172,000 --> 0:07:25,000
SK: They are small. But they have excellent hearing.

132
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But not big; for instance, in zebras, they have a huge ear

133
0:07:32.255,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that's very mobile, so they can actually turn them both around.

134
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And they use them in the same way we use our binocular vision.

135
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
They use that to pinpoint sound.

136
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The desert's extremely windy as well as being very cold.

137
0:07:46.341,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So not only do they have the very long eyelashes,

138
0:07:50.836,000 --> 0:07:51,000
but there's the secondary --

139
0:07:52.719,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I guess you'd call it the [unclear] or whatever.

140
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
It's this hair that's above the eyes, and below it, it's longer.

141
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Most people think that the humps store water.

142
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
They don't. They store fat.

143
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Now, I'm not a chemist, but basically what happens

144
0:08:13.763,000 --> 0:08:18,000
is the fat is oxidized by their breathing.

145
0:08:19.651,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And that will turn it into actually usable water.

146
0:08:24.557,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Like a lot of predators, they walk on their toes.

147
0:08:28.496,000 --> 0:08:31,000
But there's a big fat pad in there that squishes out.

148
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
They're like sun shoes, but, you know, with sand.

149
0:08:38.03,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Hooves? They don't have traditional hooves,

150
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
but they do have one, like, big nail.

151
0:08:44.144,000 --> 0:08:45,000
(Audience laughter)

152
0:08:45.462,000 --> 0:08:47,000
You can't really see too clear. The fur's kind of grown over.

153
0:08:48.463,000 --> 0:08:5,000
But they use their tails a lot, especially in rut.

154
0:08:52.358,000 --> 0:08:57,000
He will urinate and spin his tail to spread the urine around

155
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
and make him more attractive.

156
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I don't know why that would be, but it works for them.

157
0:09:04.28,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So, what the hell.

158
0:09:05.799,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Audience laughter)

159
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Now, they will also defecate in certain areas.

160
0:09:11.953,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Generally, they poop wherever they want to,

161
0:09:14.552,000 --> 0:09:2,000
but during their rut, they will defecate in perimeter areas.

162
0:09:21.09,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I don't know if you've read or heard about the sub-sonic sounds from elephants,

163
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
you know what I mean, like, "Br-r-r!"

164
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
These big, big rumbling sounds. He will do the same thing.

165
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
You can actually see, right here, it will vibrate.

166
0:09:36.071,000 --> 0:09:37,000
We weigh our animals.

167
0:09:37.993,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Unfortunately, he's a very aggressive animal,

168
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
so he's actually destroyed some of the scales.

169
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We had these big things that I weigh the bison on, for instance.

170
0:09:48.232,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I'm guessing that he's at least 1,600 pounds.

171
0:09:51.98,000 --> 0:09:53,000
But I would put him closer to 2,000.

172
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
He's basically a walking mulch pile.

173
0:09:56.575,000 --> 0:09:59,000
We're kind of like buds, but I'm also a male as well.

174
0:09:59.701,000 --> 0:10:01,000
KB: He sees you as competition? Senior Keeper: Yeah, exactly.

175
0:10:02.628,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And it makes him very dangerous at this time of year.

176
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Don't even think about it. Don't think about it!

177
0:10:11.194,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But now, we're going to meet. Out!

178
0:10:14.874,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Out! Out!

179
0:10:19.087,000 --> 0:10:2,000
No.

180
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Out!

181
0:10:23.602,000 --> 0:10:26,000
(Music)

182
0:10:47.136,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Applause)

183
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
KB: What I didn't show you was, you got that swinging thing going?

184
0:10:53.484,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Well, and you're glad I didn't show you this.

185
0:10:56.582,000 --> 0:10:58,000
One of the other things about the camel's beautiful design

186
0:10:59.36,000 --> 0:11:,000
is that its penis points backwards.

187
0:11:01.574,000 --> 0:11:05,000
That way the camel can dip its tail in the stream,

188
0:11:05.701,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and just whacker the entire area around him.

189
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And that's how he really marks his territory.

190
0:11:11.652,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Now, what you also didn't see was that --

191
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and you may have noticed in the pen beside him

192
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and, by the way, the camel's name is Suki.

193
0:11:19.938,000 --> 0:11:2,000
In the pen beside him is Jasmine.

194
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Jasmine has been his mate for some time.

195
0:11:24.43,000 --> 0:11:27,000
But on this particular occasion, it was very, very clear

196
0:11:27.894,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that as horny as Suki was, Jasmine was having none of it.

197
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And so we started thinking.

198
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Well, if poor old Suki is in search of a mate,

199
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
what would Suki do to find the perfect mate?

200
0:11:41.962,000 --> 0:11:42,000
I'm going to show you another film.

201
0:11:43.659,000 --> 0:11:45,000
But before I do, I just want to mention

202
0:11:46.033,000 --> 0:11:5,000
that this animal truly is a sort of the SUV of the sand,

203
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
the ship of the desert.

204
0:11:52.61,000 --> 0:11:57,000
It's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas

205
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
in which the camel is found, largely Mongolia and Sahara,

206
0:12:00.906,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that there are 160 words in Arabic to describe the camel.

207
0:12:06.453,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And if this is a creature that was designed by committee,

208
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
it's certainly been like no committee I've ever been on.

209
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So here's what Suki would do in search of a mate.

210
0:12:19.024,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Can you roll it, please?

211
0:12:20.208,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Camel seeking camel

212
0:12:21.835,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Lusty beast desires attractive and sincere mate.

213
0:12:24.795,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I'm seven feet, 2,000 lbs., with brown hair and eyes, long legs --

214
0:12:28.058,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and I'm very well ... hung.

215
0:12:34.643,000 --> 0:12:35,000
I'm TED Camel.

216
0:12:36.319,000 --> 0:12:38,000
The perfect desert machine.

217
0:12:40.399,000 --> 0:12:42,000
I'm smartly designed.

218
0:12:42.954,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Eyelashes that keep out sand

219
0:12:44.619,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and a third eyelash that works like a windshield wiper.

220
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
A distinguished nose --

221
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
with nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust

222
0:12:57.043,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and a groove that catches moisture.

223
0:12:59.922,000 --> 0:13:,000
Amazingly full lips --

224
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
that allow me to eat practically anything that grows.

225
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Callouses on my knees that let me kneel comfortably.

226
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Leathery chest pads that beat the heat.

227
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Short fur that keeps my skin cool.

228
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Long legs that allow heat to escape.

229
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And my hump?

230
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Ogden Nash once wrote:

231
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
"The camel has a single hump; the dromedary two,

232
0:13:34.423,000 --> 0:13:36,000
or else the other way around. I'm never sure. Are you?"

233
0:13:38.059,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Here's a hint:

234
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Bactarian.

235
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Dromedary.

236
0:13:45.905,000 --> 0:13:47,000
My hump contains up to 80 lbs. of fat, but doesn't store H2O.

237
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I'm built to last.

238
0:13:55.652,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I'm the go-to animal when the oasis is dry.

239
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
I usually won't sweat until my body reaches 105 ºF,

240
0:14:01.565,000 --> 0:14:02,000
enough to fry an egg.

241
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
I'm able to lose 40% of my weight without dying.

242
0:14:09.409,000 --> 0:14:11,000
(Most animals would if they lost half that much.)

243
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
I'll drink 5 to 7 gallons of water a day.

244
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
But go without for more than a month.

245
0:14:21.874,000 --> 0:14:22,000
I'm powerful.

246
0:14:23.59,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Able to pack up to 400 lbs. of cargo.

247
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Outrun a horse --

248
0:14:31.969,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And cover 26 miles on a good day.

249
0:14:36.749,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Camelot.

250
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Jackie O. once said that traveling by camel

251
0:14:40.232,000 --> 0:14:43,000
made riding an elephant seem like taking a jet plane.

252
0:14:47.112,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Yet my large, soft feet allow me to navigate sand.

253
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
(Is that why the Bedouin claim I can dance?)

254
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I'm a good provider, too.

255
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
Bedouins call the camel the Gift of God.

256
0:15:02.001,000 --> 0:15:03,000
No surprise.

257
0:15:03.292,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Tents and rugs are made of my hair.

258
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
My dried bones are prized as a sort of ivory.

259
0:15:07.327,000 --> 0:15:09,000
My dung is burned as fuel. My milk is used for cheese.

260
0:15:09.923,000 --> 0:15:11,000
"Camels are like angels," a Bedouin once said.

261
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
(Applause)

262
0:15:16.763,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Thank you. I just want to leave you with one last thought,

263
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
which is probably the most important thing to take away.

264
0:15:24.882,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Humans, the animal, are pretty lucky creatures because, by and large,

265
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
we really don't have to adapt to our environment;

266
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
we adapt our environment to us.

267
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And we've seen that repeatedly through this conference,

268
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
not just this year, but in past years.

269
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
But this creature that you've just seen

270
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
ultimately adapts, and keeps adapting and adapting.

271
0:15:48.018,000 --> 0:15:5,000
I think when you look at the animal kingdom,

272
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
that is one of the most remarkable things.

273
0:15:52.184,000 --> 0:15:54,000
It doesn't have an environment that adapts to it;

274
0:15:55.094,000 --> 0:15:56,000
it has to adapt to the environment.

275
0:15:56.914,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Ricky, thank you very much for having me.

276
0:15:58.913,000 --> 0:15:59,000
RW: That's terrific. Thank you.

1
0:00:12.68,000 --> 0:00:13,000
For over a decade,

2
0:00:14.68,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I have studied young people that have been pushed out of school,

3
0:00:19.76,000 --> 0:00:2,000
so called "dropouts."

4
0:00:22.32,000 --> 0:00:25,000
As they end up failed by the education system,

5
0:00:25.8,000 --> 0:00:28,000
they're on the streets where they're vulnerable to violence,

6
0:00:29.36,000 --> 0:00:3,000
police harassment,

7
0:00:30.84,000 --> 0:00:31,000
police brutality

8
0:00:32.32,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and incarceration.

9
0:00:34.6,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I follow these young people for years at a time,

10
0:00:38.8,000 --> 0:00:4,000
across institutional settings,

11
0:00:41.24,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to try to understand what some of us call the "school-to-prison pipeline."

12
0:00:48.72,000 --> 0:00:49,000
When you look at a picture like this,

13
0:00:50.72,000 --> 0:00:52,000
of young people who are in my study ...

14
0:00:55.44,000 --> 0:00:56,000
you might see trouble.

15
0:00:56.88,000 --> 0:01:,000
I mean one of the boys has a bottle of liquor in his hand,

16
0:01:01.08,000 --> 0:01:03,000
he's 14 years old

17
0:01:03.24,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and it's a school day.

18
0:01:05.44,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Other people, when they see this picture,

19
0:01:07.96,000 --> 0:01:09,000
might see gangs,

20
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:12,000
thugs, delinquents --

21
0:01:12.12,000 --> 0:01:13,000
criminals.

22
0:01:13.68,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But I see it different.

23
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I see these young people through a perspective

24
0:01:19.52,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that looks at the assets that they bring to the education system.

25
0:01:24.32,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So will you join me in changing the way we label young people

26
0:01:29.36,000 --> 0:01:32,000
from "at-risk" to "at-promise?"

27
0:01:34.48,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Applause)

28
0:01:41.8,000 --> 0:01:42,000
How do I know that these young people

29
0:01:43.64,000 --> 0:01:46,000
have the potential and the promise to change?

30
0:01:47.12,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I know this because I am one of them.

31
0:01:50.68,000 --> 0:01:54,000
You see, I grew up in dire poverty in the inner city,

32
0:01:55.04,000 --> 0:01:56,000
without a father --

33
0:01:56.28,000 --> 0:01:58,000
he abandoned me before I was even born.

34
0:01:59.28,000 --> 0:02:,000
We were on welfare,

35
0:02:01.12,000 --> 0:02:02,000
sometimes homeless,

36
0:02:02.44,000 --> 0:02:03,000
many times hungry.

37
0:02:04.72,000 --> 0:02:06,000
By the time I was 15 years old,

38
0:02:07.04,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I had been incarcerated in juvy three times for three felonies.

39
0:02:12.24,000 --> 0:02:14,000
My best friend had already been killed.

40
0:02:15.76,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And soon after,

41
0:02:17.28,000 --> 0:02:19,000
while I'm standing next to my uncle,

42
0:02:19.84,000 --> 0:02:2,000
he gets shot.

43
0:02:21.56,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And as I'm waiting for the ambulance to arrive

44
0:02:24.08,000 --> 0:02:25,000
for over an hour ...

45
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:3,000
he bleeds to death on the street.

46
0:02:32.6,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I had lost faith and hope in the world,

47
0:02:36.36,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and I had given up on the system because the system had failed me.

48
0:02:40.52,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I had nothing to offer

49
0:02:42.64,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and no one had anything to offer me.

50
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I was fatalistic.

51
0:02:48.76,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I didn't even think I could make it to my 18th birthday.

52
0:02:52.44,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The reason I'm here today

53
0:02:54.68,000 --> 0:02:58,000
is because a teacher that cared reached out

54
0:02:59.2,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and managed to tap into my soul.

55
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:04,000
This teacher,

56
0:03:04.4,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Ms. Russ ...

57
0:03:07.92,000 --> 0:03:11,000
she was the kind of teacher that was always in your business.

58
0:03:12.24,000 --> 0:03:13,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:16,000
She was the kind of teacher that was like,

60
0:03:16.48,000 --> 0:03:19,000
"Victor, I'm here for you whenever you're ready."

61
0:03:19.64,000 --> 0:03:2,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:21.88,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I wasn't ready.

63
0:03:23.56,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But she understood one basic principle about young people like me.

64
0:03:27.84,000 --> 0:03:28,000
We're like oysters.

65
0:03:29.76,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We're only going to open up when we're ready,

66
0:03:32.52,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and if you're not there when we're ready,

67
0:03:35.96,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we're going to clam back up.

68
0:03:38.4,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Ms. Russ was there for me.

69
0:03:40.12,000 --> 0:03:42,000
She was culturally relevant,

70
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
she respected my community, my people, my family.

71
0:03:46.32,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I told her a story about my Uncle Ruben.

72
0:03:50.24,000 --> 0:03:52,000
He would take me to work with him because I was broke,

73
0:03:52.92,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and he knew I needed some money.

74
0:03:54.8,000 --> 0:03:56,000
He collected glass bottles for a living.

75
0:03:58.64,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Four in the morning on a school day,

76
0:04:00.4,000 --> 0:04:02,000
we'd throw the glass bottles in the back of his van,

77
0:04:03.76,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and the bottles would break.

78
0:04:05.76,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And my hands and arms would start to bleed

79
0:04:07.84,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and my tennis shoes and pants would get all bloody.

80
0:04:12.32,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And I was terrified and in pain, and I would stop working.

81
0:04:16.88,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And my uncle, he would look me in the eyes and he would say to me,

82
0:04:20.2,000 --> 0:04:21,000
"Mijo,

83
0:04:21.56,000 --> 0:04:23,000
estamos buscando vida."

84
0:04:25.04,000 --> 0:04:27,000
"We're searching for a better life,

85
0:04:27.6,000 --> 0:04:31,000
we're trying to make something out of nothing."

86
0:04:32.88,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Ms. Russ listened to my story,

87
0:04:35.72,000 --> 0:04:37,000
welcomed it into the classroom and said,

88
0:04:38.24,000 --> 0:04:4,000
"Victor, this is your power.

89
0:04:40.92,000 --> 0:04:41,000
This is your potential.

90
0:04:42.84,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Your family, your culture, your community have taught you a hard-work ethic

91
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and you will use it to empower yourself in the academic world

92
0:04:53.52,000 --> 0:04:56,000
so you can come back and empower your community."

93
0:04:58.52,000 --> 0:04:59,000
With Ms. Russ's help,

94
0:05:00.44,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I ended up returning to school.

95
0:05:03.48,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I even finished my credits on time

96
0:05:07.48,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and graduated with my class.

97
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Applause)

98
0:05:17.76,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But Ms. Russ said to me right before graduation,

99
0:05:20.44,000 --> 0:05:22,000
"Victor, I'm so proud of you.

100
0:05:23.72,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I knew you could do it.

101
0:05:25.72,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Now it's time to go to college."

102
0:05:28.96,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:31.32,000 --> 0:05:32,000
College, me?

104
0:05:32.56,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Man, what is this teacher smoking thinking I'm going to college?

105
0:05:36.48,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I applied with the mentors and support she provided,

106
0:05:40.92,000 --> 0:05:42,000
got a letter of acceptance,

107
0:05:43.04,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and one of the paragraphs read,

108
0:05:45.28,000 --> 0:05:48,000
"You've been admitted under probationary status."

109
0:05:49.4,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I said, "Probation? I'm already on probation,

110
0:05:51.92,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that don't matter?"

111
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Laughter)

112
0:05:54.44,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It was academic probation, not criminal probation.

113
0:05:59.32,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But what do teachers like Ms. Russ do to succeed with young people

114
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
like the ones I study?

115
0:06:05.08,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I propose three strategies.

116
0:06:07.28,000 --> 0:06:08,000
The first:

117
0:06:08.52,000 --> 0:06:12,000
let's get rid of our deficit perspective in education.

118
0:06:12.72,000 --> 0:06:14,000
"These people come from a culture of violence,

119
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:16,000
a culture of poverty.

120
0:06:16.28,000 --> 0:06:18,000
These people are at-risk; these people are truant.

121
0:06:18.88,000 --> 0:06:22,000
These people are empty containers for us to fill with knowledge.

122
0:06:25.04,000 --> 0:06:26,000
They have the problems,

123
0:06:26.72,000 --> 0:06:28,000
we have the solutions."

124
0:06:30.2,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Number two.

125
0:06:31.84,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Let's value the stories that young people bring to the schoolhouse.

126
0:06:37.56,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Their stories of overcoming insurmountable odds are so powerful.

127
0:06:43.08,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And I know you know some of these stories.

128
0:06:48.84,000 --> 0:06:51,000
These very same stories and experiences

129
0:06:52.12,000 --> 0:06:56,000
already have grit, character and resilience in them.

130
0:06:57.64,000 --> 0:07:,000
So let's help young people refine those stories.

131
0:07:00.84,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Let's help them be proud of who they are,

132
0:07:02.84,000 --> 0:07:05,000
because our education system welcomes their families, their cultures,

133
0:07:06.8,000 --> 0:07:07,000
their communities

134
0:07:08.04,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and the skill set they've learned to survive.

135
0:07:11.68,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And of course the third strategy being the most important:

136
0:07:15.84,000 --> 0:07:16,000
resources.

137
0:07:17.08,000 --> 0:07:2,000
We have to provide adequate resources to young people.

138
0:07:22.04,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Grit alone isn't going to cut it.

139
0:07:26.08,000 --> 0:07:28,000
You can sit there and tell me all you want,

140
0:07:28.28,000 --> 0:07:31,000
"Hey man, pick yourself up by the bootstraps."

141
0:07:31.44,000 --> 0:07:34,000
But if I was born without any straps on my boots --

142
0:07:34.52,000 --> 0:07:35,000
(Laughter)

143
0:07:35.76,000 --> 0:07:36,000
How am I supposed to pick myself up?

144
0:07:37.52,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Applause)

145
0:07:45.52,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Job training,

146
0:07:46.76,000 --> 0:07:47,000
mentoring,

147
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:49,000
counseling ...

148
0:07:49.72,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Teaching young people to learn from their mistakes

149
0:07:52.48,000 --> 0:07:53,000
instead of criminalizing them,

150
0:07:54.2,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and dragging them out of their classrooms like animals.

151
0:07:59.4,000 --> 0:08:,000
How about this?

152
0:08:00.64,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I propose that we implement restorative justice in every high school in America.

153
0:08:06.4,000 --> 0:08:08,000
(Applause)

154
0:08:13.2,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So we went out to test these ideas in the community of Watts in LA

155
0:08:19.08,000 --> 0:08:22,000
with 40 young people that had been pushed out of school.

156
0:08:22.36,000 --> 0:08:23,000
William was one of them.

157
0:08:24.6,000 --> 0:08:28,000
William was the kind of kid that had been given every label.

158
0:08:28.92,000 --> 0:08:31,000
He had dropped out, he was a gang member,

159
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
a criminal.

160
0:08:34.2,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And when we met him he was very resistant.

161
0:08:36.8,000 --> 0:08:38,000
But I remember what Ms. Russ used to say.

162
0:08:39.24,000 --> 0:08:42,000
"Hey, I'm here for you whenever you're ready."

163
0:08:42.56,000 --> 0:08:43,000
(Laughter)

164
0:08:44.039,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So over time --

165
0:08:46.48,000 --> 0:08:48,000
over time he began to open up.

166
0:08:48.72,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And I remember the day that he made the switch.

167
0:08:51.96,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We were in a large group

168
0:08:53.64,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and a young lady in our program was crying

169
0:08:56.76,000 --> 0:08:58,000
because she told us her powerful story

170
0:09:00.52,000 --> 0:09:03,000
of her dad being killed

171
0:09:03.72,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and then his body being shown in the newspaper the next day.

172
0:09:11.96,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And as she's crying, I don't know what to do,

173
0:09:14.2,000 --> 0:09:15,000
so I give her her space,

174
0:09:15.96,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and William had enough.

175
0:09:18.64,000 --> 0:09:2,000
He slammed his hands on the desk and he said,

176
0:09:21.64,000 --> 0:09:25,000
"Hey, everybody! Group hug! Group hug!"

177
0:09:27.64,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Applause)

178
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
This young lady's tears and pain turned into joy and laughter

179
0:09:41.2,000 --> 0:09:45,000
knowing that her community had her back,

180
0:09:45.8,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and William had now learned that he did have a purpose in life:

181
0:09:50.6,000 --> 0:09:54,000
to help to heal the souls of people in his own community.

182
0:09:56.52,000 --> 0:09:57,000
He told us his story.

183
0:09:58.2,000 --> 0:09:59,000
We refined his story

184
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:04,000
to go from being the story of a victim to being the story of a survivor

185
0:10:04.84,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that has overcome adversity.

186
0:10:07.24,000 --> 0:10:08,000
We placed high value on it.

187
0:10:09.68,000 --> 0:10:12,000
William went on to finish high school,

188
0:10:14.36,000 --> 0:10:18,000
get his security guard certificate to become a security guard,

189
0:10:19.12,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and is now working at a local school district.

190
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:25,000
(Applause)

191
0:10:31.76,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Ms. Russ's mantra --

192
0:10:33.36,000 --> 0:10:35,000
her mantra was always,

193
0:10:35.64,000 --> 0:10:39,000
"when you teach to the heart, the mind will follow."

194
0:10:42.6,000 --> 0:10:45,000
The great writer Khalil Gibran says,

195
0:10:47.2,000 --> 0:10:51,000
"Out of suffering have emerged the greatest souls.

196
0:10:52.44,000 --> 0:10:56,000
The massive characters are seared with scars."

197
0:10:58.04,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I believe that in this education revolution that we're talking about

198
0:11:03.72,000 --> 0:11:07,000
we need to invite the souls of the young people that we work with,

199
0:11:08.68,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and once they're able to refine --

200
0:11:10.96,000 --> 0:11:13,000
identify their grit, resilience and character

201
0:11:14.04,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that they've already developed --

202
0:11:17.08,000 --> 0:11:21,000
their academic performance will improve.

203
0:11:23.36,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Let's believe in young people.

204
0:11:25.72,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Let's provide them the right kinds of resources.

205
0:11:29.04,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I'll tell you what my teacher did for me.

206
0:11:31.72,000 --> 0:11:33,000
She believed in me so much

207
0:11:35.12,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that she tricked me into believing in myself.

208
0:11:39.24,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Thank you.

209
0:11:40.48,000 --> 0:11:42,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.487,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So in my free time outside of Twitter

2
0:00:15.076,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I experiment a little bit

3
0:00:16.527,000 --> 0:00:18,000
with telling stories online, experimenting

4
0:00:19.15,000 --> 0:00:21,000
with what we can do with new digital tools.

5
0:00:21.573,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And in my job at Twitter,

6
0:00:23.079,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I actually spent a little bit of time

7
0:00:24.695,000 --> 0:00:26,000
working with authors and storytellers as well,

8
0:00:27.439,000 --> 0:00:29,000
helping to expand out the bounds

9
0:00:29.644,000 --> 0:00:31,000
of what people are experimenting with.

10
0:00:31.954,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And I want to talk through some examples today

11
0:00:34.324,000 --> 0:00:35,000
of things that people have done

12
0:00:35.733,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that I think are really fascinating

13
0:00:37.902,000 --> 0:00:4,000
using flexible identity and anonymity on the web

14
0:00:41.037,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and blurring the lines between fact and fiction.

15
0:00:45.11,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But I want to start and go back to the 1930s.

16
0:00:47.262,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Long before a little thing called Twitter,

17
0:00:49.573,000 --> 0:00:52,000
radio brought us broadcasts

18
0:00:52.614,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and connected millions of people

19
0:00:55.498,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to single points of broadcast.

20
0:00:57.939,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And from those single points emanated stories.

21
0:01:01.961,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Some of them were familiar stories.

22
0:01:03.95,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Some of them were new stories.

23
0:01:05.415,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And for a while they were familiar formats,

24
0:01:08.414,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but then radio began to evolve its own

25
0:01:10.635,000 --> 0:01:12,000
unique formats specific to that medium.

26
0:01:13.566,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Think about episodes that happened live on radio.

27
0:01:17.25,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Combining the live play

28
0:01:19.573,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and the serialization of written fiction,

29
0:01:21.934,000 --> 0:01:23,000
you get this new format.

30
0:01:24.119,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And the reason why I bring up radio is that I think

31
0:01:26.048,000 --> 0:01:3,000
radio is a great example of how a new medium

32
0:01:30.173,000 --> 0:01:33,000
defines new formats which then define new stories.

33
0:01:33.98,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And of course, today, we have an entirely new

34
0:01:36.916,000 --> 0:01:37,000
medium to play with,

35
0:01:38.517,000 --> 0:01:39,000
which is this online world.

36
0:01:39.943,000 --> 0:01:42,000
This is the map of verified users on Twitter

37
0:01:43.807,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and the connections between them.

38
0:01:45.113,000 --> 0:01:47,000
There are thousands upon thousands of them.

39
0:01:47.88,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Every single one of these points

40
0:01:49.475,000 --> 0:01:5,000
is its own broadcaster.

41
0:01:51.357,000 --> 0:01:54,000
We've gone to this world of many to many,

42
0:01:55.03,000 --> 0:01:59,000
where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting.

43
0:01:59.795,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And I think that we should start to see

44
0:02:02.368,000 --> 0:02:03,000
wildly new formats emerge

45
0:02:04.053,000 --> 0:02:07,000
as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium.

46
0:02:07.961,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier

47
0:02:11.313,000 --> 0:02:13,000
for creative experimentation, if you will,

48
0:02:13.501,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that we've explored and begun to settle

49
0:02:16.85,000 --> 0:02:17,000
this wild land of the Internet

50
0:02:18.829,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and are now just getting ready

51
0:02:21.072,000 --> 0:02:23,000
to start to build structures on it,

52
0:02:23.154,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and those structures are the new formats

53
0:02:25.241,000 --> 0:02:29,000
of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create.

54
0:02:29.794,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I believe this starts with an evolution

55
0:02:32.099,000 --> 0:02:33,000
of existing methods.

56
0:02:33.993,000 --> 0:02:34,000
The short story, for example,

57
0:02:35.756,000 --> 0:02:36,000
people are saying that the short story

58
0:02:37.218,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is experiencing a renaissance of sorts

59
0:02:39.993,000 --> 0:02:42,000
thanks to e-readers, digital marketplaces.

60
0:02:43.392,000 --> 0:02:46,000
One writer, Hugh Howey, experimented

61
0:02:46.47,000 --> 0:02:47,000
with short stories on Amazon

62
0:02:48.191,000 --> 0:02:52,000
by releasing one very short story called "Wool."

63
0:02:52.723,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And he actually says that he didn't intend

64
0:02:55.225,000 --> 0:02:56,000
for "Wool" to become a series,

65
0:02:56.57,000 --> 0:02:58,000
but that the audience loved the first story so much

66
0:02:59.196,000 --> 0:03:01,000
they demanded more, and so he gave them more.

67
0:03:01.607,000 --> 0:03:04,000
He gave them "Wool 2," which was a little bit longer than the first one,

68
0:03:05.111,000 --> 0:03:06,000
"Wool 3," which was even longer,

69
0:03:07.105,000 --> 0:03:08,000
culminating in "Wool 5,"

70
0:03:08.895,000 --> 0:03:1,000
which was a 60,000-word novel.

71
0:03:11.736,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I think Howey was able to do all of this because

72
0:03:15.721,000 --> 0:03:17,000
he had the quick feedback system of e-books.

73
0:03:18.664,000 --> 0:03:19,000
He was able to write and publish

74
0:03:20.466,000 --> 0:03:21,000
in relatively short order.

75
0:03:22.055,000 --> 0:03:25,000
There was no mediator between him and the audience.

76
0:03:25.152,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It was just him directly connected with his audience

77
0:03:27.958,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and building on the feedback and enthusiasm

78
0:03:30.107,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that they were giving him.

79
0:03:31.928,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So this whole project was an experiment.

80
0:03:33.813,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It started with the one short story,

81
0:03:35.92,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and I think the experimentation actually became

82
0:03:38.049,000 --> 0:03:4,000
a part of Howey's format.

83
0:03:40.377,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And that's something that this medium enabled,

84
0:03:43.616,000 --> 0:03:47,000
was experimentation being a part of the format itself.

85
0:03:47.793,000 --> 0:03:5,000
This is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan

86
0:03:50.964,000 --> 0:03:51,000
called "Black Box."

87
0:03:52.412,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It was originally written

88
0:03:53.919,000 --> 0:03:54,000
specifically with Twitter in mind.

89
0:03:55.6,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Egan convinced The New Yorker

90
0:03:57.909,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to start a New Yorker fiction account

91
0:04:00.331,000 --> 0:04:01,000
from which they could tweet

92
0:04:02.148,000 --> 0:04:03,000
all of these lines that she created.

93
0:04:03.952,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Now Twitter, of course, has a 140-character limit.

94
0:04:07.399,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Egan mocked that up just writing manually

95
0:04:10.24,000 --> 0:04:12,000
in this storyboard sketchbook,

96
0:04:13.156,000 --> 0:04:15,000
used the physical space constraints

97
0:04:16.143,000 --> 0:04:17,000
of those storyboard squares

98
0:04:17.652,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to write each individual tweet,

99
0:04:19.453,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and those tweets ended up becoming

100
0:04:22.392,000 --> 0:04:25,000
over 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker.

101
0:04:26.08,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Every night, at 8 p.m., you could tune in

102
0:04:29.85,000 --> 0:04:32,000
to a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account.

103
0:04:33.418,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I think that's pretty exciting:

104
0:04:34.962,000 --> 0:04:36,000
tune-in literary fiction.

105
0:04:37.468,000 --> 0:04:4,000
The experience of Egan's story, of course,

106
0:04:40.529,000 --> 0:04:43,000
like anything on Twitter, there were multiple ways to experience it.

107
0:04:43.578,000 --> 0:04:44,000
You could scroll back through it,

108
0:04:45.117,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but interestingly, if you were watching it live,

109
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:5,000
there was this suspense that built

110
0:04:50.631,000 --> 0:04:52,000
because the actual tweets,

111
0:04:53.148,000 --> 0:04:55,000
you had no control over when you would read them.

112
0:04:55.451,000 --> 0:04:57,000
They were coming at a pretty regular clip,

113
0:04:57.891,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but as the story was building,

114
0:05:00.269,000 --> 0:05:03,000
normally, as a reader, you control how fast you move through a text,

115
0:05:03.512,000 --> 0:05:05,000
but in this case, The New Yorker did,

116
0:05:05.823,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and they were sending you bit by bit by bit,

117
0:05:08.993,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line.

118
0:05:12.275,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Another great example of fiction

119
0:05:15.346,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and the short story on Twitter,

120
0:05:17.39,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Elliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called "Evidence."

121
0:05:20.813,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It began with this tweet: "On November 28

122
0:05:23.443,000 --> 0:05:25,000
at 10:13 p.m.,

123
0:05:25.594,000 --> 0:05:27,000
a woman identified as Miranda Brown,

124
0:05:27.669,000 --> 0:05:29,000
44, of Brooklyn, fell to her death

125
0:05:30.499,000 --> 0:05:32,000
from the roof of a Manhattan hotel."

126
0:05:32.865,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It begins in Elliott's voice,

127
0:05:34.595,000 --> 0:05:35,000
but then Elliott's voice recedes,

128
0:05:36.336,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot and Simon,

129
0:05:39.718,000 --> 0:05:42,000
characters that Elliott created on Twitter

130
0:05:42.817,000 --> 0:05:43,000
specifically to tell this story,

131
0:05:44.546,000 --> 0:05:46,000
a story from multiple perspectives

132
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
leading up to this moment at 10:13 p.m.

133
0:05:50.285,000 --> 0:05:52,000
when this woman falls to her death.

134
0:05:52.563,000 --> 0:05:55,000
These three characters brought an authentic vision

135
0:05:55.667,000 --> 0:05:56,000
from multiple perspectives.

136
0:05:57.389,000 --> 0:05:59,000
One reviewer called Elliott's story

137
0:05:59.715,000 --> 0:06:01,000
"Twitter fiction done right," because she did.

138
0:06:02.605,000 --> 0:06:03,000
She captured that voice

139
0:06:04.333,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time.

140
0:06:07.521,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Interestingly, though, it wasn't just

141
0:06:10.22,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Twitter as a distribution mechanism.

142
0:06:12.384,000 --> 0:06:14,000
It was also Twitter as a production mechanism.

143
0:06:14.528,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Elliott told me later

144
0:06:15.772,000 --> 0:06:19,000
she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs.

145
0:06:19.819,000 --> 0:06:22,000
She laid on the couch and just went back and forth

146
0:06:23.622,000 --> 0:06:24,000
between different characters

147
0:06:25.471,000 --> 0:06:27,000
tweeting out each line, line by line.

148
0:06:28.084,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I think that this kind of spontaneous creation

149
0:06:30.837,000 --> 0:06:32,000
of what was coming out of the characters' voices

150
0:06:33.353,000 --> 0:06:36,000
really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves,

151
0:06:36.462,000 --> 0:06:38,000
but also to this format that she had created

152
0:06:39.14,000 --> 0:06:43,000
of multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter.

153
0:06:43.753,000 --> 0:06:45,000
As you begin to play with flexible identity online,

154
0:06:46.48,000 --> 0:06:47,000
it gets even more interesting

155
0:06:47.777,000 --> 0:06:48,000
as you start to interact with the real world.

156
0:06:49.722,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Things like Invisible Obama

157
0:06:51.626,000 --> 0:06:53,000
or the famous "binders full of women"

158
0:06:53.867,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that came up during the 2012 election cycle,

159
0:06:56.413,000 --> 0:07:,000
or even the fan fiction universe of "West Wing" Twitter

160
0:07:00.584,000 --> 0:07:02,000
in which you have all of these accounts

161
0:07:02.694,000 --> 0:07:04,000
for every single one of the characters in "The West Wing,"

162
0:07:05.67,000 --> 0:07:08,000
including the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window

163
0:07:09.573,000 --> 0:07:13,000
in one single episode. (Laughter)

164
0:07:13.709,000 --> 0:07:16,000
All of these are rapid iterations on a theme.

165
0:07:16.845,000 --> 0:07:18,000
They are creative people experimenting

166
0:07:19.161,000 --> 0:07:22,000
with the bounds of what is possible in this medium.

167
0:07:22.217,000 --> 0:07:23,000
You look at something like "West Wing" Twitter,

168
0:07:23.97,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in which you have these fictional characters

169
0:07:26.37,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that engage with the real world.

170
0:07:28.328,000 --> 0:07:29,000
They comment on politics,

171
0:07:30.12,000 --> 0:07:34,000
they cry out against the evils of Congress.

172
0:07:34.654,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Keep in mind, they're all Democrats.

173
0:07:36.438,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And they engage with the real world.

174
0:07:39.758,000 --> 0:07:4,000
They respond to it.

175
0:07:41.616,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So once you take flexible identity,

176
0:07:43.761,000 --> 0:07:45,000
anonymity, engagement with the real world,

177
0:07:46.46,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and you move beyond simple homage or parody

178
0:07:49.631,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and you put these tools to work in telling a story,

179
0:07:53.22,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that's when things get really interesting.

180
0:07:55.103,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So during the Chicago mayoral election

181
0:07:57.912,000 --> 0:07:58,000
there was a parody account.

182
0:07:59.48,000 --> 0:08:,000
It was Mayor Emanuel.

183
0:08:00.894,000 --> 0:08:03,000
It gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel,

184
0:08:04.36,000 --> 0:08:07,000
particularly in the expletive department.

185
0:08:07.68,000 --> 0:08:09,000
This foul-mouthed account

186
0:08:09.759,000 --> 0:08:12,000
followed the daily activities of the race,

187
0:08:13.646,000 --> 0:08:14,000
providing commentary as it went.

188
0:08:15.326,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It followed all of the natural tropes

189
0:08:17.807,000 --> 0:08:19,000
of a good, solid Twitter parody account,

190
0:08:20.189,000 --> 0:08:23,000
but then started to get weird.

191
0:08:23.871,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And as it progressed, it moved from this commentary

192
0:08:27.244,000 --> 0:08:32,000
to a multi-week, real-time science fiction epic

193
0:08:32.512,000 --> 0:08:35,000
in which your protagonist, Rahm Emanuel,

194
0:08:35.6,000 --> 0:08:39,000
engages in multi-dimensional travel on election day,

195
0:08:39.757,000 --> 0:08:41,000
which is -- it didn't actually happen.

196
0:08:42.37,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I double checked the newspapers.

197
0:08:45.788,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And then, very interestingly, it came to an end.

198
0:08:49.331,000 --> 0:08:5,000
This is something that doesn't usually happen

199
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
with a Twitter parody account.

200
0:08:52.791,000 --> 0:08:55,000
It ended, a true narrative conclusion.

201
0:08:56.52,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And so the author, Dan Sinker, who was a journalist,

202
0:08:59.742,000 --> 0:09:01,000
who was completely anonymous this whole time,

203
0:09:02.077,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I think Dan -- it made a lot of sense for him

204
0:09:05.775,000 --> 0:09:06,000
to turn this into a book,

205
0:09:07.359,000 --> 0:09:1,000
because it was a narrative format in the end,

206
0:09:10.732,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and I think that turning it into a book

207
0:09:13.293,000 --> 0:09:16,000
is representative of this idea that he had created something new

208
0:09:16.991,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that needed to be translated into previous formats.

209
0:09:20.617,000 --> 0:09:22,000
One of my favorite examples

210
0:09:22.71,000 --> 0:09:23,000
of something that's happening on Twitter right now,

211
0:09:24.706,000 --> 0:09:28,000
actually, is the very absurdist Crimer Show.

212
0:09:29.482,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Crimer Show tells the story

213
0:09:31.914,000 --> 0:09:33,000
of a supercriminal and a hapless detective

214
0:09:34.655,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo,

215
0:09:38.34,000 --> 0:09:4,000
with all of the tropes of a television show.

216
0:09:40.762,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Crimer Show's creator has said that

217
0:09:42.299,000 --> 0:09:46,000
it is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K.,

218
0:09:47.291,000 --> 0:09:49,000
but, man, is it weird.

219
0:09:50.149,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And there are all these times where Crimer,

220
0:09:52.12,000 --> 0:09:54,000
the supercriminal, does all of these TV things.

221
0:09:54.549,000 --> 0:09:56,000
He's always taking off his sunglasses

222
0:09:56.801,000 --> 0:09:58,000
or turning to the camera,

223
0:09:59.769,000 --> 0:10:01,000
but these things just happen in text.

224
0:10:02.209,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I think borrowing all of these tropes from television

225
0:10:05.043,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and additionally presenting each Crimer Show

226
0:10:08.795,000 --> 0:10:13,000
as an episode, spelled E-P-P-A-S-O-D, "eppasod,"

227
0:10:14.028,000 --> 0:10:16,000
presenting them as episodes

228
0:10:16.077,000 --> 0:10:19,000
really, it creates something new.

229
0:10:19.107,000 --> 0:10:22,000
There is a new "eppasod" of Crimer Show

230
0:10:22.696,000 --> 0:10:24,000
on Twitter pretty much every day,

231
0:10:24.82,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and they're archived that way.

232
0:10:26.432,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And I think this is an interesting experiment in format.

233
0:10:29.213,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Something totally new has been created here

234
0:10:31.497,000 --> 0:10:34,000
out of parodying something on television.

235
0:10:35.033,000 --> 0:10:37,000
I think in nonfiction real-time storytelling,

236
0:10:37.873,000 --> 0:10:39,000
there are a lot of really excellent examples as well.

237
0:10:40.64,000 --> 0:10:41,000
RealTimeWWII is an account

238
0:10:42.589,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago

239
0:10:46.652,000 --> 0:10:48,000
in exceptional detail, as if

240
0:10:49.021,000 --> 0:10:51,000
you were reading the news reports from that day.

241
0:10:51.75,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And the author Teju Cole has done

242
0:10:53.505,000 --> 0:10:56,000
a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist

243
0:10:56.916,000 --> 0:10:57,000
on events of the news.

244
0:10:58.544,000 --> 0:11:02,000
In this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes.

245
0:11:02.987,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I think that in both of these examples,

246
0:11:05.587,000 --> 0:11:06,000
you're beginning to see ways in which

247
0:11:07.228,000 --> 0:11:09,000
people are telling stories with nonfiction content

248
0:11:10.052,000 --> 0:11:12,000
that can be built into new types

249
0:11:12.961,000 --> 0:11:14,000
of fictional storytelling.

250
0:11:15.522,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So with real-time storytelling,

251
0:11:18.084,000 --> 0:11:2,000
blurring the lines between fact and fiction,

252
0:11:20.613,000 --> 0:11:22,000
the real world and the digital world,

253
0:11:22.69,000 --> 0:11:25,000
flexible identity, anonymity,

254
0:11:26.472,000 --> 0:11:29,000
these are all tools that we have accessible to us,

255
0:11:29.993,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and I think that they're just the building blocks.

256
0:11:31.885,000 --> 0:11:33,000
They are the bits that we use

257
0:11:34.523,000 --> 0:11:36,000
to create the structures, the frames,

258
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that then become our settlements on this

259
0:11:40.258,000 --> 0:11:42,000
wide open frontier for creative experimentation.

260
0:11:43.018,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Thank you.

261
0:11:44.469,000 --> 0:11:48,000
(Applause)

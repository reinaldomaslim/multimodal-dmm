1
0:00:12.84,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I believe that the secret to producing extremely drought-tolerant crops,

2
0:00:17.08,000 --> 0:00:2,000
which should go some way to providing food security in the world,

3
0:00:20.32,000 --> 0:00:22,000
lies in resurrection plants,

4
0:00:23.04,000 --> 0:00:26,000
pictured here, in an extremely droughted state.

5
0:00:26.2,000 --> 0:00:28,000
You might think that these plants look dead,

6
0:00:29.08,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but they're not.

7
0:00:30.4,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Give them water,

8
0:00:31.88,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and they will resurrect, green up, start growing, in 12 to 48 hours.

9
0:00:38.32,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Now, why would I suggest

10
0:00:39.64,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that producing drought-tolerant crops will go towards providing food security?

11
0:00:45.04,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Well, the current world population is around 7 billion.

12
0:00:48.96,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And it's estimated that by 2050,

13
0:00:51.48,000 --> 0:00:53,000
we'll be between 9 and 10 billion people,

14
0:00:54.2,000 --> 0:00:56,000
with the bulk of this growth happening in Africa.

15
0:00:57.88,000 --> 0:00:59,000
The food and agricultural organizations of the world

16
0:01:00.36,000 --> 0:01:03,000
have suggested that we need a 70 percent increase

17
0:01:03.52,000 --> 0:01:05,000
in current agricultural practice

18
0:01:05.72,000 --> 0:01:06,000
to meet that demand.

19
0:01:07.72,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Given that plants are at the base of the food chain,

20
0:01:10.44,000 --> 0:01:12,000
most of that's going to have to come from plants.

21
0:01:13.36,000 --> 0:01:15,000
That percentage of 70 percent

22
0:01:16.08,000 --> 0:01:2,000
does not take into consideration the potential effects of climate change.

23
0:01:20.32,000 --> 0:01:24,000
This is taken from a study by Dai published in 2011,

24
0:01:25.24,000 --> 0:01:26,000
where he took into consideration

25
0:01:27.2,000 --> 0:01:29,000
all the potential effects of climate change

26
0:01:29.6,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and expressed them -- amongst other things --

27
0:01:31.76,000 --> 0:01:35,000
increased aridity due to lack of rain or infrequent rain.

28
0:01:36.4,000 --> 0:01:37,000
The areas in red shown here,

29
0:01:38.2,000 --> 0:01:4,000
are areas that until recently

30
0:01:40.28,000 --> 0:01:43,000
have been very successfully used for agriculture,

31
0:01:43.48,000 --> 0:01:45,000
but cannot anymore because of lack of rainfall.

32
0:01:46.64,000 --> 0:01:48,000
This is the situation that's predicted to happen in 2050.

33
0:01:50.84,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Much of Africa, in fact, much of the world,

34
0:01:53.04,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is going to be in trouble.

35
0:01:54.96,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We're going to have to think of some very smart ways of producing food.

36
0:01:58.64,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And preferably among them, some drought-tolerant crops.

37
0:02:01.96,000 --> 0:02:03,000
The other thing to remember about Africa is

38
0:02:04.04,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that most of their agriculture is rainfed.

39
0:02:08.08,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now, making drought-tolerant crops is not the easiest thing in the world.

40
0:02:11.56,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And the reason for this is water.

41
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Water is essential to life on this planet.

42
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
All living, actively metabolizing organisms,

43
0:02:21.32,000 --> 0:02:23,000
from microbes to you and I,

44
0:02:23.4,000 --> 0:02:25,000
are comprised predominately of water.

45
0:02:25.76,000 --> 0:02:27,000
All life reactions happen in water.

46
0:02:28.32,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And loss of a small amount of water results in death.

47
0:02:31.36,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You and I are 65 percent water --

48
0:02:33.44,000 --> 0:02:34,000
we lose one percent of that, we die.

49
0:02:35.84,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But we can make behavioral changes to avoid that.

50
0:02:39.92,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Plants can't.

51
0:02:41.52,000 --> 0:02:42,000
They're stuck in the ground.

52
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And so in the first instance they have a little bit more water than us,

53
0:02:46.56,000 --> 0:02:47,000
about 95 percent water,

54
0:02:47.84,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and they can lose a little bit more than us,

55
0:02:49.96,000 --> 0:02:51,000
like 10 to about 70 percent, depending on the species,

56
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but for short periods only.

57
0:02:56.68,000 --> 0:03:,000
Most of them will either try to resist or avoid water loss.

58
0:03:00.88,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So extreme examples of resistors can be found in succulents.

59
0:03:04.84,000 --> 0:03:06,000
They tend to be small, very attractive,

60
0:03:07.68,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but they hold onto their water at such great cost

61
0:03:10.44,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that they grow extremely slowly.

62
0:03:13.44,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Examples of avoidance of water loss are found in trees and shrubs.

63
0:03:18.04,000 --> 0:03:19,000
They send down very deep roots,

64
0:03:19.64,000 --> 0:03:2,000
mine subterranean water supplies

65
0:03:21.36,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and just keep flushing it through them at all times,

66
0:03:23.84,000 --> 0:03:24,000
keeping themselves hydrated.

67
0:03:25.72,000 --> 0:03:26,000
The one on the right is called a baobab.

68
0:03:27.72,000 --> 0:03:29,000
It's also called the upside-down tree,

69
0:03:29.8,000 --> 0:03:32,000
simply because the proportion of roots to shoots is so great

70
0:03:33.6,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that it looks like the tree has been planted upside down.

71
0:03:36.32,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And of course the roots are required for hydration of that plant.

72
0:03:40.76,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And probably the most common strategy of avoidance is found in annuals.

73
0:03:45.84,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Annuals make up the bulk of our plant food supplies.

74
0:03:49.04,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Up the west coast of my country,

75
0:03:50.76,000 --> 0:03:53,000
for much of the year you don't see much vegetation growth.

76
0:03:54.32,000 --> 0:03:56,000
But come the spring rains, you get this:

77
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:58,000
flowering of the desert.

78
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:,000
The strategy in annuals,

79
0:04:00.88,000 --> 0:04:02,000
is to grow only in the rainy season.

80
0:04:03.96,000 --> 0:04:05,000
At the end of that season they produce a seed,

81
0:04:06.28,000 --> 0:04:08,000
which is dry, eight to 10 percent water,

82
0:04:09.12,000 --> 0:04:1,000
but very much alive.

83
0:04:10.8,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And anything that is that dry and still alive,

84
0:04:13.72,000 --> 0:04:14,000
we call desiccation-tolerant.

85
0:04:15.84,000 --> 0:04:16,000
In the desiccated state,

86
0:04:17.28,000 --> 0:04:19,000
what seeds can do is lie in extremes of environment

87
0:04:19.96,000 --> 0:04:2,000
for prolonged periods of time.

88
0:04:21.64,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The next time the rainy season comes,

89
0:04:23.88,000 --> 0:04:24,000
they germinate and grow,

90
0:04:25.4,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and the whole cycle just starts again.

91
0:04:28.12,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It's widely believed that the evolution of desiccation-tolerant seeds

92
0:04:32.2,000 --> 0:04:34,000
allowed the colonization and the radiation

93
0:04:34.4,000 --> 0:04:37,000
of flowering plants, or angiosperms, onto land.

94
0:04:38.96,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But back to annuals as our major form of food supplies.

95
0:04:42.8,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Wheat, rice and maize form 95 percent of our plant food supplies.

96
0:04:48.48,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And it's been a great strategy

97
0:04:50.04,000 --> 0:04:53,000
because in a short space of time you can produce a lot of seed.

98
0:04:53.24,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Seeds are energy-rich so there's a lot of food calories,

99
0:04:55.884,000 --> 0:04:58,000
you can store it in times of plenty for times of famine,

100
0:05:00.48,000 --> 0:05:01,000
but there's a downside.

101
0:05:02.56,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The vegetative tissues,

102
0:05:03.96,000 --> 0:05:05,000
the roots and leaves of annuals,

103
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
do not have much

104
0:05:07.44,000 --> 0:05:11,000
by way of inherent resistance, avoidance or tolerance characteristics.

105
0:05:11.56,000 --> 0:05:12,000
They just don't need them.

106
0:05:12.88,000 --> 0:05:13,000
They grow in the rainy season

107
0:05:14.32,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and they've got a seed to help them survive the rest of the year.

108
0:05:17.72,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And so despite concerted efforts in agriculture

109
0:05:20.44,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to make crops with improved properties

110
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
of resistance, avoidance and tolerance --

111
0:05:25.2,000 --> 0:05:26,000
particularly resistance and avoidance

112
0:05:27.12,000 --> 0:05:29,000
because we've had good models to understand how those work --

113
0:05:30.04,000 --> 0:05:32,000
we still get images like this.

114
0:05:32.4,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Maize crop in Africa,

115
0:05:33.88,000 --> 0:05:34,000
two weeks without rain

116
0:05:35.32,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and it's dead.

117
0:05:37.56,000 --> 0:05:38,000
There is a solution:

118
0:05:39.52,000 --> 0:05:4,000
resurrection plants.

119
0:05:41.32,000 --> 0:05:44,000
These plants can lose 95 percent of their cellular water,

120
0:05:45.12,000 --> 0:05:48,000
remain in a dry, dead-like state for months to years,

121
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and give them water,

122
0:05:50.76,000 --> 0:05:51,000
they green up and start growing again.

123
0:05:53.56,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Like seeds, these are desiccation-tolerant.

124
0:05:56.88,000 --> 0:06:,000
Like seeds, these can withstand extremes of environmental conditions.

125
0:06:01.76,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And this is a really rare phenomenon.

126
0:06:03.8,000 --> 0:06:07,000
There are only 135 flowering plant species that can do this.

127
0:06:08.2,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I'm going to show you a video

128
0:06:09.64,000 --> 0:06:11,000
of the resurrection process of these three species

129
0:06:12.28,000 --> 0:06:13,000
in that order.

130
0:06:13.52,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And at the bottom,

131
0:06:14.8,000 --> 0:06:16,000
there's a time axis so you can see how quickly it happens.

132
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Applause)

133
0:07:02.24,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Pretty amazing, huh?

134
0:07:03.8,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So I've spent the last 21 years trying to understand how they do this.

135
0:07:08.04,000 --> 0:07:1,000
How do these plants dry without dying?

136
0:07:11.08,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And I work on a variety of different resurrection plants,

137
0:07:13.88,000 --> 0:07:15,000
shown here in the hydrated and dry states,

138
0:07:16.32,000 --> 0:07:17,000
for a number of reasons.

139
0:07:17.8,000 --> 0:07:19,000
One of them is that each of these plants serves as a model

140
0:07:20.68,000 --> 0:07:22,000
for a crop that I'd like to make drought-tolerant.

141
0:07:23.08,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So on the extreme top left, for example, is a grass,

142
0:07:26.04,000 --> 0:07:28,000
it's called Eragrostis nindensis,

143
0:07:28.32,000 --> 0:07:3,000
it's got a close relative called Eragrostis tef --

144
0:07:30.72,000 --> 0:07:32,000
a lot of you might know it as "teff" --

145
0:07:32.76,000 --> 0:07:33,000
it's a staple food in Ethiopia,

146
0:07:34.52,000 --> 0:07:35,000
it's gluten-free,

147
0:07:35.8,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and it's something we would like to make drought-tolerant.

148
0:07:38.84,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The other reason for looking at a number of plants,

149
0:07:41.28,000 --> 0:07:42,000
is that, at least initially,

150
0:07:42.68,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I wanted to find out: do they do the same thing?

151
0:07:44.96,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Do they all use the same mechanisms

152
0:07:46.68,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to be able to lose all that water and not die?

153
0:07:49.28,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So I undertook what we call a systems biology approach

154
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:54,000
in order to get a comprehensive understanding

155
0:07:54.2,000 --> 0:07:56,000
of desiccation tolerance,

156
0:07:56.24,000 --> 0:07:57,000
in which we look at everything

157
0:07:57.72,000 --> 0:07:59,000
from the molecular to the whole plant, ecophysiological level.

158
0:08:00.657,000 --> 0:08:01,000
For example we look at things like

159
0:08:02.316,000 --> 0:08:04,000
changes in the plant anatomy as they dried out

160
0:08:04.537,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and their ultrastructure.

161
0:08:05.8,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We look at the transcriptome, which is just a term for a technology

162
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:1,000
in which we look at the genes

163
0:08:10.44,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that are switched on or off, in response to drying.

164
0:08:12.88,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Most genes will code for proteins, so we look at the proteome.

165
0:08:16.12,000 --> 0:08:18,000
What are the proteins made in response to drying?

166
0:08:19.48,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Some proteins would code for enzymes which make metabolites,

167
0:08:23.4,000 --> 0:08:24,000
so we look at the metabolome.

168
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Now, this is important because plants are stuck in the ground.

169
0:08:28.32,000 --> 0:08:32,000
They use what I call a highly tuned chemical arsenal

170
0:08:32.44,000 --> 0:08:35,000
to protect themselves from all the stresses of their environment.

171
0:08:35.88,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So it's important that we look

172
0:08:37.4,000 --> 0:08:39,000
at the chemical changes involved in drying.

173
0:08:40.52,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And at the last study that we do at the molecular level,

174
0:08:43.2,000 --> 0:08:44,000
we look at the lipidome --

175
0:08:44.48,000 --> 0:08:46,000
the lipid changes in response to drying.

176
0:08:46.559,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And that's also important

177
0:08:47.84,000 --> 0:08:49,000
because all biological membranes are made of lipids.

178
0:08:50.679,000 --> 0:08:52,000
They're held as membranes because they're in water.

179
0:08:53.28,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Take away the water, those membranes fall apart.

180
0:08:56.24,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Lipids also act as signals to turn on genes.

181
0:09:00.2,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Then we use physiological and biochemical studies

182
0:09:02.92,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to try and understand the function of the putative protectants

183
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that we've actually discovered in our other studies.

184
0:09:09.12,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And then use all of that to try and understand

185
0:09:11.32,000 --> 0:09:13,000
how the plant copes with its natural environment.

186
0:09:15.48,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I've always had the philosophy that I needed a comprehensive understanding

187
0:09:19.84,000 --> 0:09:21,000
of the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance

188
0:09:22.12,000 --> 0:09:25,000
in order to make a meaningful suggestion for a biotic application.

189
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I'm sure some of you are thinking,

190
0:09:28.68,000 --> 0:09:29,000
"By biotic application,

191
0:09:29.96,000 --> 0:09:31,000
does she mean she's going to make genetically modified crops?"

192
0:09:34.24,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And the answer to that question is:

193
0:09:35.96,000 --> 0:09:37,000
depends on your definition of genetic modification.

194
0:09:39.2,000 --> 0:09:41,000
All of the crops that we eat today, wheat, rice and maize,

195
0:09:42.04,000 --> 0:09:45,000
are highly genetically modified from their ancestors,

196
0:09:45.28,000 --> 0:09:46,000
but we don't consider them GM

197
0:09:47.28,000 --> 0:09:49,000
because they're being produced by conventional breeding.

198
0:09:50.88,000 --> 0:09:53,000
If you mean, am I going to put resurrection plant genes into crops,

199
0:09:54.68,000 --> 0:09:55,000
your answer is yes.

200
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:59,000
In the essence of time, we have tried that approach.

201
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
More appropriately, some of my collaborators at UCT,

202
0:10:02.04,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Jennifer Thomson, Suhail Rafudeen,

203
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:05,000
have spearheaded that approach

204
0:10:05.64,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and I'm going to show you some data soon.

205
0:10:09.2,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But we're about to embark upon an extremely ambitious approach,

206
0:10:13.24,000 --> 0:10:16,000
in which we aim to turn on whole suites of genes

207
0:10:16.72,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that are already present in every crop.

208
0:10:19.44,000 --> 0:10:21,000
They're just never turned on under extreme drought conditions.

209
0:10:22.8,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I leave it up to you to decide

210
0:10:24.28,000 --> 0:10:25,000
whether those should be called GM or not.

211
0:10:27.56,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I'm going to now just give you some of the data from that first approach.

212
0:10:31.04,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And in order to do that

213
0:10:32.32,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I have to explain a little bit about how genes work.

214
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So you probably all know

215
0:10:36.28,000 --> 0:10:38,000
that genes are made of double-stranded DNA.

216
0:10:38.36,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It's wound very tightly into chromosomes

217
0:10:40.32,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that are present in every cell of your body or in a plant's body.

218
0:10:44.08,000 --> 0:10:47,000
If you unwind that DNA, you get genes.

219
0:10:47.84,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And each gene has a promoter,

220
0:10:50.32,000 --> 0:10:52,000
which is just an on-off switch,

221
0:10:52.72,000 --> 0:10:53,000
the gene coding region,

222
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and then a terminator,

223
0:10:55.44,000 --> 0:10:58,000
which indicates that this is the end of this gene, the next gene will start.

224
0:10:59.72,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Now, promoters are not simple on-off switches.

225
0:11:02.64,000 --> 0:11:04,000
They normally require a lot of fine-tuning,

226
0:11:05.36,000 --> 0:11:09,000
lots of things to be present and correct before that gene is switched on.

227
0:11:10.24,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So what's typically done in biotech studies

228
0:11:13.32,000 --> 0:11:14,000
is that we use an inducible promoter,

229
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
we know how to switch it on.

230
0:11:16.76,000 --> 0:11:18,000
We couple that to genes of interest

231
0:11:18.8,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and put that into a plant and see how the plant responds.

232
0:11:22.12,000 --> 0:11:24,000
In the study that I'm going to talk to you about,

233
0:11:24.72,000 --> 0:11:26,000
my collaborators used a drought-induced promoter,

234
0:11:27.2,000 --> 0:11:29,000
which we discovered in a resurrection plant.

235
0:11:29.64,000 --> 0:11:32,000
The nice thing about this promoter is that we do nothing.

236
0:11:32.8,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The plant itself senses drought.

237
0:11:35.6,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And we've used it to drive antioxidant genes from resurrection plants.

238
0:11:40.72,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Why antioxidant genes?

239
0:11:42.6,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Well, all stresses, particularly drought stress,

240
0:11:45.68,000 --> 0:11:47,000
results in the formation of free radicals,

241
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:5,000
or reactive oxygen species,

242
0:11:50.36,000 --> 0:11:52,000
which are highly damaging and can cause crop death.

243
0:11:53.68,000 --> 0:11:55,000
What antioxidants do is stop that damage.

244
0:11:57.36,000 --> 0:12:,000
So here's some data from a maize strain that's very popularly used in Africa.

245
0:12:01.28,000 --> 0:12:04,000
To the left of the arrow are plants without the genes,

246
0:12:04.6,000 --> 0:12:05,000
to the right --

247
0:12:05.88,000 --> 0:12:07,000
plants with the antioxidant genes.

248
0:12:07.96,000 --> 0:12:08,000
After three weeks without watering,

249
0:12:09.8,000 --> 0:12:11,000
the ones with the genes do a hell of a lot better.

250
0:12:13.72,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Now to the final approach.

251
0:12:15.08,000 --> 0:12:18,000
My research has shown that there's considerable similarity

252
0:12:18.64,000 --> 0:12:22,000
in the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in seeds and resurrection plants.

253
0:12:23.08,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So I ask the question,

254
0:12:24.52,000 --> 0:12:25,000
are they using the same genes?

255
0:12:26.48,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Or slightly differently phrased,

256
0:12:28.76,000 --> 0:12:32,000
are resurrection plants using genes evolved in seed desiccation tolerance

257
0:12:33.28,000 --> 0:12:34,000
in their roots and leaves?

258
0:12:34.56,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Have they retasked these seed genes

259
0:12:36.64,000 --> 0:12:38,000
in roots and leaves of resurrection plants?

260
0:12:39.76,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And I answer that question,

261
0:12:41.64,000 --> 0:12:43,000
as a consequence of a lot of research from my group

262
0:12:44.08,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and recent collaborations from a group of Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands,

263
0:12:47.64,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Mel Oliver in the United States

264
0:12:49.24,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and Julia Buitink in France.

265
0:12:51.88,000 --> 0:12:52,000
The answer is yes,

266
0:12:53.32,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that there is a core set of genes that are involved in both.

267
0:12:56.2,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And I'm going to illustrate this very crudely for maize,

268
0:12:59.64,000 --> 0:13:01,000
where the chromosomes below the off switch

269
0:13:02.08,000 --> 0:13:05,000
represent all the genes that are required for desiccation tolerance.

270
0:13:05.68,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So as maize seeds dried out at the end of their period of development,

271
0:13:09.96,000 --> 0:13:1,000
they switch these genes on.

272
0:13:12.68,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Resurrection plants switch on the same genes

273
0:13:15.6,000 --> 0:13:16,000
when they dry out.

274
0:13:17.28,000 --> 0:13:18,000
All modern crops, therefore,

275
0:13:19.08,000 --> 0:13:21,000
have these genes in their roots and leaves,

276
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
they just never switch them on.

277
0:13:22.92,000 --> 0:13:23,000
They only switch them on in seed tissues.

278
0:13:25.44,000 --> 0:13:26,000
So what we're trying to do right now

279
0:13:27.2,000 --> 0:13:29,000
is to understand the environmental and cellular signals

280
0:13:29.84,000 --> 0:13:31,000
that switch on these genes in resurrection plants,

281
0:13:33.28,000 --> 0:13:34,000
to mimic the process in crops.

282
0:13:35.68,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And just a final thought.

283
0:13:37.44,000 --> 0:13:39,000
What we're trying to do very rapidly

284
0:13:39.68,000 --> 0:13:42,000
is to repeat what nature did in the evolution of resurrection plants

285
0:13:43.52,000 --> 0:13:44,000
some 10 to 40 million years ago.

286
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
My plants and I thank you for your attention.

287
0:13:48.68,000 --> 0:13:54,000
(Applause)

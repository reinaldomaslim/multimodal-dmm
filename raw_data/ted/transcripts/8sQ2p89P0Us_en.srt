2
0:00:13.112,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So, my journey began in the Bronx, New York,

3
0:00:18.098,000 --> 0:00:19,000
in a one-bedroom apartment,

4
0:00:19.89,000 --> 0:00:21,000
with my two sisters and immigrant mother.

5
0:00:23.712,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I loved our neighborhood.

6
0:00:27.382,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It was lively.

7
0:00:28.914,000 --> 0:00:3,000
There was all this merengue blasting,

8
0:00:31.383,000 --> 0:00:33,000
neighbors socializing on building stoops

9
0:00:33.796,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and animated conversations over domino playing.

10
0:00:38.327,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It was home,

11
0:00:40.852,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and it was sweet.

12
0:00:43.368,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But it wasn't simple.

13
0:00:45.645,000 --> 0:00:48,000
In fact, everyone at school knew the block where we lived,

14
0:00:49.283,000 --> 0:00:53,000
because it was where people came to buy weed and other drugs.

15
0:00:53.95,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And with drug-dealing comes conflict,

16
0:00:56.544,000 --> 0:00:59,000
so we often went to sleep to the sound of gunshots.

17
0:01:01.839,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I spent much of my childhood worried,

18
0:01:05.121,000 --> 0:01:07,000
worried about our safety.

19
0:01:08.803,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And so did our mother.

20
0:01:11.277,000 --> 0:01:15,000
She worried that the violence we witnessed would overtake our lives;

21
0:01:16.338,000 --> 0:01:17,000
that our poverty meant

22
0:01:18.087,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that the neighbors with whom we lived and shared space

23
0:01:20.786,000 --> 0:01:21,000
would harm us.

24
0:01:22.851,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Our entire life was in the Bronx,

25
0:01:26.566,000 --> 0:01:28,000
but my mother's anxiety spurred her into action,

26
0:01:29.586,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and soon we were driving so fast to Connecticut --

27
0:01:34.38,000 --> 0:01:35,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:35.476,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to boarding school campuses, with full scholarships in tow.

29
0:01:39.857,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Man, don't underestimate the power of a mother

30
0:01:45.615,000 --> 0:01:47,000
determined to keep her children safe.

31
0:01:49.01,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Cheers)

32
0:01:50.316,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Applause)

33
0:01:55.553,000 --> 0:01:56,000
At boarding school,

34
0:01:58.658,000 --> 0:02:,000
for the first time,

35
0:02:01.867,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I was able to sleep without worry.

36
0:02:05.391,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I could leave my dorm room unlocked,

37
0:02:07.968,000 --> 0:02:08,000
walk barefoot in the grass,

38
0:02:10.291,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and look up to see a night sky full of stars.

39
0:02:16.061,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Happy novelties.

40
0:02:19.172,000 --> 0:02:21,000
But there were other novelties as well.

41
0:02:22.298,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Very quickly, I felt like I didn't belong.

42
0:02:26.469,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I learned that I didn't speak the right way,

43
0:02:29.382,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and to demonstrate the proper ways of speaking,

44
0:02:33.226,000 --> 0:02:37,000
my teachers gave me frequent lessons, in public,

45
0:02:37.759,000 --> 0:02:4,000
on the appropriate way to enunciate certain words.

46
0:02:43.068,000 --> 0:02:45,000
A teacher once instructed me in the hallway:

47
0:02:47.04,000 --> 0:02:49,000
"Aaaaaas-king."

48
0:02:51.535,000 --> 0:02:52,000
She said this loudly.

49
0:02:54.024,000 --> 0:02:58,000
"Dena, it's not 'axing,' like you're running around with an axe.

50
0:02:59.809,000 --> 0:03:,000
That's silly."

51
0:03:02.082,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Now at this point, you can imagine the snickers of my classmates,

52
0:03:08.258,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but she continued:

53
0:03:11.246,000 --> 0:03:15,000
"Think about breaking the word into 'ass' and 'king,'

54
0:03:16.667,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and then put the two together to say it correctly --

55
0:03:20.72,000 --> 0:03:21,000
'Asking.'"

56
0:03:23.918,000 --> 0:03:26,000
There were some other moments that reminded me that I didn't belong.

57
0:03:28.186,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Once, I walked into a classmate's dorm room,

58
0:03:32.028,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and I watched her watch her valuables around me.

59
0:03:36.349,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Like, why would she do that? I thought to myself.

60
0:03:40.385,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And then there was the time

61
0:03:42.848,000 --> 0:03:45,000
when another classmate walked into my dorm room,

62
0:03:46.311,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and yelled, "Ew!" as I was applying hair grease to my scalp.

63
0:03:53.072,000 --> 0:03:57,000
There is emotional damage done when young people can't be themselves,

64
0:03:58.504,000 --> 0:04:02,000
when they are forced to edit who they are in order to be acceptable.

65
0:04:04.627,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It's a kind of violence.

66
0:04:08.94,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Ultimately, I'm a quintessential success story.

67
0:04:13.992,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I attended boarding school and college in New England,

68
0:04:17.223,000 --> 0:04:19,000
studied abroad in Chile

69
0:04:19.327,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and returned to the Bronx to be a middle school teacher.

70
0:04:23.027,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I received a Truman Scholarship,

71
0:04:25.448,000 --> 0:04:28,000
a Fulbright and a Soros Fellowship.

72
0:04:28.69,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And I could list more.

73
0:04:30.598,000 --> 0:04:31,000
(Laughter)

74
0:04:32.116,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But I won't.

75
0:04:33.336,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Laughter)

76
0:04:35.908,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I earned my doctorate at Columbia University.

77
0:04:39.792,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Cheers)

78
0:04:40.907,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Applause)

79
0:04:42.737,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And then I landed a job at Yale.

80
0:04:45.103,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Applause)

81
0:04:47.363,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I am proud of everything that I've been able to accomplish

82
0:04:52.036,000 --> 0:04:53,000
on my journey thus far.

83
0:04:56.884,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I have eternal imposter syndrome.

84
0:05:01.15,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Either I've been invited because I'm a token,

85
0:05:04.083,000 --> 0:05:06,000
which really isn't about me,

86
0:05:06.314,000 --> 0:05:09,000
but rather, about a box someone needed to check off.

87
0:05:10.388,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Or, I am exceptional,

88
0:05:13.673,000 --> 0:05:17,000
which means I've had to leave the people I love behind.

89
0:05:19.528,000 --> 0:05:25,000
It's the price that I and so many others pay for learning while black.

90
0:05:27.595,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Applause)

91
0:05:34.689,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I police myself all the time.

92
0:05:40.008,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Are my pants too tight?

93
0:05:42.768,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Should I wear my hair up or in a fro?

94
0:05:46.726,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Should I speak up for myself,

95
0:05:49.195,000 --> 0:05:53,000
or will the power of my words be reduced to: "She's angry"?

96
0:05:56.114,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Why did I have to leave the Bronx

97
0:05:58.748,000 --> 0:06:,000
to gain access to a better education?

98
0:06:03.433,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And why, in the process of getting that better education,

99
0:06:07.918,000 --> 0:06:12,000
did I have to endure the trauma of erasing what made me, me --

100
0:06:15.449,000 --> 0:06:19,000
a black girl from the Bronx, raised by an Antiguan mother?

101
0:06:21.861,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So when I think about our current education reform initiatives,

102
0:06:27.39,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I can't help asking:

103
0:06:30.179,000 --> 0:06:33,000
What are our students of color learning about themselves?

104
0:06:35.83,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Three -- three decades of research reveal

105
0:06:39.141,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that students of color are suspended and expelled

106
0:06:42.431,000 --> 0:06:45,000
at a rate three times greater than white students,

107
0:06:46.17,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and are punished in harsher ways for the same infractions.

108
0:06:53.138,000 --> 0:06:56,000
They also learn this through the absence of their lives and narratives

109
0:06:56.659,000 --> 0:06:57,000
in the curricula.

110
0:06:59.432,000 --> 0:07:03,000
The Cooperative Children's Book Center did a review of nearly 4,000 books

111
0:07:04.848,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and found that only three percent were about African-Americans.

112
0:07:10.686,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And they further learn this

113
0:07:12.073,000 --> 0:07:14,000
through the lack of teachers that look like them.

114
0:07:17.55,000 --> 0:07:18,000
An analysis of data

115
0:07:19.013,000 --> 0:07:22,000
from the National Center for Education Statistics

116
0:07:22.751,000 --> 0:07:27,000
found that 45 percent of our nation's pre-K to high school students

117
0:07:27.931,000 --> 0:07:28,000
were people of color,

118
0:07:30.3,000 --> 0:07:34,000
while only 17 percent of our teachers are.

119
0:07:36.881,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Our youth of color pay a profound price

120
0:07:39.742,000 --> 0:07:41,000
when their schooling sends them the message

121
0:07:41.884,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that they must be controlled,

122
0:07:44.479,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that they must leave their identities at home

123
0:07:46.887,000 --> 0:07:48,000
in order to be successful.

124
0:07:51.027,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Every child deserves an education

125
0:07:54.338,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that guarantees the safety to learn

126
0:07:57.883,000 --> 0:08:01,000
in the comfort of one's own skin.

127
0:08:03.484,000 --> 0:08:06,000
(Applause)

128
0:08:11.551,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It is possible to create emotionally and physically safe classrooms

129
0:08:16.818,000 --> 0:08:18,000
where students also thrive academically.

130
0:08:20.511,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I know, because I did it in my classroom

131
0:08:23.925,000 --> 0:08:25,000
when I returned to teach in the Bronx.

132
0:08:27.681,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So what did that look like?

133
0:08:31.04,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I centered my instruction

134
0:08:33.098,000 --> 0:08:37,000
on the lives, histories and identities of my students.

135
0:08:38.621,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And I did all of this because I wanted my students to know

136
0:08:41.637,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that everyone around them was supporting them

137
0:08:45.348,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to be their best self.

138
0:08:49.054,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So while I could not control the instability of their homes,

139
0:08:54.321,000 --> 0:08:56,000
the uncertainty of their next meal,

140
0:08:57.472,000 --> 0:08:59,000
or the loud neighbors that kept them from sleep,

141
0:09:00.641,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I provided them with a loving classroom

142
0:09:04.031,000 --> 0:09:06,000
that made them feel proud of who they are,

143
0:09:07.313,000 --> 0:09:09,000
that made them know that they mattered.

144
0:09:11.62,000 --> 0:09:12,000
You know,

145
0:09:14.522,000 --> 0:09:19,000
every time I hear or say the word "asking,"

146
0:09:22.977,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I am in high school again.

147
0:09:26.135,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I am thinking about "ass" and "king"

148
0:09:32.117,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and putting the two together so that I speak in a way

149
0:09:36.206,000 --> 0:09:39,000
where someone in power will want to listen.

150
0:09:42.115,000 --> 0:09:43,000
There is a better way,

151
0:09:44.365,000 --> 0:09:47,000
one that doesn't force kids of color into a double bind;

152
0:09:48.799,000 --> 0:09:5,000
a way for them to preserve their ties

153
0:09:51.185,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to their families, homes and communities;

154
0:09:54.944,000 --> 0:09:58,000
a way that teaches them to trust their instincts

155
0:10:00.555,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and to have faith in their own creative genius.

156
0:10:07.144,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Thank you.

157
0:10:08.351,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Applause)

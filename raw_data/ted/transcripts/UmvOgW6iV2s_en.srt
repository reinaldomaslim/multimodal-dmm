2
0:00:12.743,000 --> 0:00:14,000
We always hear that texting is a scourge.

3
0:00:15.605,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The idea is that texting spells the decline and fall

4
0:00:20.445,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of any kind of serious literacy, or at least writing ability,

5
0:00:23.945,000 --> 0:00:25,000
among young people in the United States

6
0:00:26.588,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and now the whole world today.

7
0:00:28.889,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The fact of the matter is that it just isn't true,

8
0:00:32.393,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and it's easy to think that it is true,

9
0:00:34.896,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but in order to see it in another way,

10
0:00:36.795,000 --> 0:00:39,000
in order to see that actually texting is a miraculous thing,

11
0:00:40.464,000 --> 0:00:42,000
not just energetic, but a miraculous thing,

12
0:00:43.029,000 --> 0:00:44,000
a kind of emergent complexity

13
0:00:44.776,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that we're seeing happening right now,

14
0:00:47.237,000 --> 0:00:49,000
we have to pull the camera back for a bit

15
0:00:49.543,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and look at what language really is,

16
0:00:52.961,000 --> 0:00:54,000
in which case, one thing that we see

17
0:00:55.034,000 --> 0:00:59,000
is that texting is not writing at all.

18
0:00:59.658,000 --> 0:01:,000
What do I mean by that?

19
0:01:01.48,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Basically, if we think about language,

20
0:01:04.036,000 --> 0:01:07,000
language has existed for perhaps 150,000 years,

21
0:01:07.837,000 --> 0:01:09,000
at least 80,000 years,

22
0:01:09.974,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and what it arose as is speech. People talked.

23
0:01:14.125,000 --> 0:01:17,000
That's what we're probably genetically specified for.

24
0:01:17.149,000 --> 0:01:19,000
That's how we use language most.

25
0:01:19.34,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Writing is something that came along much later,

26
0:01:22.822,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and as we saw in the last talk,

27
0:01:24.878,000 --> 0:01:26,000
there's a little bit of controversy as to exactly when that happened,

28
0:01:27.546,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but according to traditional estimates,

29
0:01:29.862,000 --> 0:01:32,000
if humanity had existed for 24 hours,

30
0:01:33.384,000 --> 0:01:38,000
then writing only came along at about 11:07 p.m.

31
0:01:38.575,000 --> 0:01:41,000
That's how much of a latterly thing writing is.

32
0:01:42.22,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So first there's speech, and then writing comes along

33
0:01:45.608,000 --> 0:01:46,000
as a kind of artifice.

34
0:01:47.37,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now don't get me wrong, writing has certain advantages.

35
0:01:51.376,000 --> 0:01:53,000
When you write, because it's a conscious process,

36
0:01:53.959,000 --> 0:01:55,000
because you can look backwards,

37
0:01:56.097,000 --> 0:01:58,000
you can do things with language that are much less likely

38
0:01:58.927,000 --> 0:02:,000
if you're just talking.

39
0:02:01.391,000 --> 0:02:04,000
For example, imagine a passage from Edward Gibbon's

40
0:02:05.292,000 --> 0:02:08,000
"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire:"

41
0:02:09.098,000 --> 0:02:12,000
"The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours,

42
0:02:12.349,000 --> 0:02:14,000
till the graduate retreat of the Persians was changed

43
0:02:14.651,000 --> 0:02:16,000
into a disorderly flight, of which the shameful example

44
0:02:17.424,000 --> 0:02:19,000
was given by the principal leaders and the Surenas himself."

45
0:02:20.011,000 --> 0:02:24,000
That's beautiful, but let's face it, nobody talks that way.

46
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Or at least, they shouldn't if they're interested

47
0:02:28.566,000 --> 0:02:3,000
in reproducing. That --

48
0:02:31.08,000 --> 0:02:33,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:33.799,000 --> 0:02:35,000
is not the way any human being speaks casually.

50
0:02:36.777,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Casual speech is something quite different.

51
0:02:39.362,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Linguists have actually shown

52
0:02:41.218,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that when we're speaking casually in an unmonitored way,

53
0:02:43.929,000 --> 0:02:45,000
we tend to speak in word packets of maybe

54
0:02:46.607,000 --> 0:02:47,000
seven to 10 words.

55
0:02:48.417,000 --> 0:02:5,000
You'll notice this if you ever have occasion to record

56
0:02:51.096,000 --> 0:02:53,000
yourself or a group of people talking.

57
0:02:54.089,000 --> 0:02:55,000
That's what speech is like.

58
0:02:55.544,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Speech is much looser. It's much more telegraphic.

59
0:02:59.849,000 --> 0:03:02,000
It's much less reflective -- very different from writing.

60
0:03:03.539,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So we naturally tend to think, because we see language

61
0:03:06.475,000 --> 0:03:08,000
written so often, that that's what language is,

62
0:03:08.917,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but actually what language is, is speech. They are two things.

63
0:03:12.885,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Now of course, as history has gone by,

64
0:03:16.139,000 --> 0:03:18,000
it's been natural for there to be a certain amount of bleed

65
0:03:18.93,000 --> 0:03:21,000
between speech and writing.

66
0:03:21.944,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So, for example, in a distant era now,

67
0:03:26.767,000 --> 0:03:28,000
it was common when one gave a speech

68
0:03:29.269,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to basically talk like writing.

69
0:03:32.386,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So I mean the kind of speech that you see someone giving

70
0:03:34.736,000 --> 0:03:36,000
in an old movie where they clear their throat, and they go,

71
0:03:37.269,000 --> 0:03:39,000
"Ahem, ladies and gentlemen," and then they speak

72
0:03:39.802,000 --> 0:03:42,000
in a certain way which has nothing to do with casual speech.

73
0:03:43.073,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It's formal. It uses long sentences like this Gibbon one.

74
0:03:46.932,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It's basically talking like you write, and so, for example,

75
0:03:50.894,000 --> 0:03:51,000
we're thinking so much these days about Lincoln

76
0:03:52.889,000 --> 0:03:54,000
because of the movie.

77
0:03:55.1,000 --> 0:03:58,000
The Gettysburg Address was not the main meal of that event.

78
0:03:58.183,000 --> 0:04:01,000
For two hours before that, Edward Everett spoke

79
0:04:02.098,000 --> 0:04:05,000
on a topic that, frankly, cannot engage us today

80
0:04:05.338,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and barely did then.

81
0:04:06.835,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The point of it was to listen to him

82
0:04:09.216,000 --> 0:04:1,000
speaking like writing.

83
0:04:10.772,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Ordinary people stood and listened to that for two hours.

84
0:04:13.12,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It was perfectly natural.

85
0:04:14.553,000 --> 0:04:16,000
That's what people did then, speaking like writing.

86
0:04:17.044,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Well, if you can speak like writing,

87
0:04:19.51,000 --> 0:04:22,000
then logically it follows that you might want to also

88
0:04:23.308,000 --> 0:04:25,000
sometimes write like you speak.

89
0:04:26.174,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The problem was just that in the material,

90
0:04:28.224,000 --> 0:04:31,000
mechanical sense, that was harder back in the day

91
0:04:31.679,000 --> 0:04:34,000
for the simple reason that materials don't lend themselves to it.

92
0:04:34.986,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It's almost impossible to do that with your hand

93
0:04:37.006,000 --> 0:04:4,000
except in shorthand, and then communication is limited.

94
0:04:40.441,000 --> 0:04:42,000
On a manual typewriter it was very difficult,

95
0:04:42.957,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and even when we had electric typewriters,

96
0:04:45.244,000 --> 0:04:47,000
or then computer keyboards, the fact is

97
0:04:47.403,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that even if you can type easily enough to keep up

98
0:04:49.702,000 --> 0:04:51,000
with the pace of speech, more or less, you have to have

99
0:04:52.495,000 --> 0:04:54,000
somebody who can receive your message quickly.

100
0:04:54.84,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Once you have things in your pocket that can receive that message,

101
0:04:58.051,000 --> 0:05:,000
then you have the conditions that allow

102
0:05:00.655,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that we can write like we speak.

103
0:05:04.166,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And that's where texting comes in.

104
0:05:07.384,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And so, texting is very loose in its structure.

105
0:05:11.153,000 --> 0:05:15,000
No one thinks about capital letters or punctuation when one texts,

106
0:05:15.45,000 --> 0:05:17,000
but then again, do you think about those things when you talk?

107
0:05:17.808,000 --> 0:05:2,000
No, and so therefore why would you when you were texting?

108
0:05:21.481,000 --> 0:05:24,000
What texting is, despite the fact that it involves

109
0:05:24.61,000 --> 0:05:26,000
the brute mechanics of something that we call writing,

110
0:05:27.436,000 --> 0:05:3,000
is fingered speech. That's what texting is.

111
0:05:30.734,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Now we can write the way we talk.

112
0:05:34.199,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And it's a very interesting thing, but nevertheless

113
0:05:36.978,000 --> 0:05:4,000
easy to think that still it represents some sort of decline.

114
0:05:41.834,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We see this general bagginess of the structure,

115
0:05:45.118,000 --> 0:05:48,000
the lack of concern with rules and the way that we're used to

116
0:05:48.467,000 --> 0:05:5,000
learning on the blackboard, and so we think

117
0:05:50.739,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that something has gone wrong.

118
0:05:53.978,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It's a very natural sense.

119
0:05:56.941,000 --> 0:06:,000
But the fact of the matter is that what is going on

120
0:06:00.975,000 --> 0:06:03,000
is a kind of emergent complexity.

121
0:06:04.546,000 --> 0:06:06,000
That's what we're seeing in this fingered speech.

122
0:06:07.302,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And in order to understand it, what we want to see

123
0:06:10.288,000 --> 0:06:14,000
is the way, in this new kind of language,

124
0:06:15.033,000 --> 0:06:18,000
there is new structure coming up.

125
0:06:18.609,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And so, for example, there is in texting a convention,

126
0:06:24.332,000 --> 0:06:26,000
which is LOL.

127
0:06:27.254,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Now LOL, we generally think of

128
0:06:29.998,000 --> 0:06:31,000
as meaning "laughing out loud."

129
0:06:32.462,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And of course, theoretically, it does,

130
0:06:34.755,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and if you look at older texts, then people used it

131
0:06:37.184,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to actually indicate laughing out loud.

132
0:06:39.704,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But if you text now, or if you are someone who

133
0:06:43.947,000 --> 0:06:46,000
is aware of the substrate of texting the way it's become,

134
0:06:47.244,000 --> 0:06:48,000
you'll notice that LOL

135
0:06:48.934,000 --> 0:06:5,000
does not mean laughing out loud anymore.

136
0:06:51.004,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It's evolved into something that is much subtler.

137
0:06:54.794,000 --> 0:06:57,000
This is an actual text that was done

138
0:06:58.241,000 --> 0:07:01,000
by a non-male person of about 20 years old

139
0:07:02.173,000 --> 0:07:03,000
not too long ago.

140
0:07:03.668,000 --> 0:07:05,000
"I love the font you're using, btw."

141
0:07:06.62,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Julie: "lol thanks gmail is being slow right now"

142
0:07:10.382,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Now if you think about it, that's not funny.

143
0:07:12.124,000 --> 0:07:14,000
No one's laughing. (Laughter)

144
0:07:15.024,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And yet, there it is, so you assume

145
0:07:16.994,000 --> 0:07:17,000
there's been some kind of hiccup.

146
0:07:18.351,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Then Susan says "lol, I know,"

147
0:07:20.185,000 --> 0:07:22,000
again more guffawing than we're used to

148
0:07:22.482,000 --> 0:07:25,000
when you're talking about these inconveniences.

149
0:07:25.712,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So Julie says, "I just sent you an email."

150
0:07:28.456,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Susan: "lol, I see it."

151
0:07:30.007,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Very funny people, if that's what LOL means.

152
0:07:33.625,000 --> 0:07:35,000
This Julie says, "So what's up?"

153
0:07:35.753,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Susan: "lol, I have to write a 10 page paper."

154
0:07:38.395,000 --> 0:07:4,000
She's not amused. Let's think about it.

155
0:07:40.709,000 --> 0:07:42,000
LOL is being used in a very particular way.

156
0:07:43.39,000 --> 0:07:46,000
It's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation.

157
0:07:47.081,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles.

158
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Any spoken language that's used by real people has them.

159
0:07:54.169,000 --> 0:07:55,000
If you happen to speak Japanese, think about

160
0:07:55.945,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that little word "ne" that you use at the end of a lot of sentences.

161
0:07:59.303,000 --> 0:08:01,000
If you listen to the way black youth today speak,

162
0:08:01.648,000 --> 0:08:02,000
think about the use of the word "yo."

163
0:08:03.434,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Whole dissertations could be written about it,

164
0:08:05.38,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and probably are being written about it.

165
0:08:07.654,000 --> 0:08:1,000
A pragmatic particle, that's what LOL has gradually become.

166
0:08:11.448,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It's a way of using the language between actual people.

167
0:08:15.497,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Another example is "slash."

168
0:08:18.736,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Now, we can use slash in the way that we're used to,

169
0:08:21.504,000 --> 0:08:22,000
along the lines of, "We're going to have

170
0:08:23.144,000 --> 0:08:26,000
a party-slash-networking session."

171
0:08:26.626,000 --> 0:08:28,000
That's kind of like what we're at.

172
0:08:28.72,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Slash is used in a very different way

173
0:08:32.259,000 --> 0:08:34,000
in texting among young people today.

174
0:08:35.217,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It's used to change the scene.

175
0:08:37.07,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So for example, this Sally person says,

176
0:08:40.019,000 --> 0:08:41,000
"So I need to find people to chill with"

177
0:08:41.824,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and Jake says, "Haha" --

178
0:08:43.343,000 --> 0:08:45,000
you could write a dissertation about "Haha" too, but we don't have time for that —

179
0:08:46.231,000 --> 0:08:48,000
"Haha so you're going by yourself? Why?"

180
0:08:48.72,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Sally: "For this summer program at NYU."

181
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Jake: "Haha. Slash I'm watching this video with suns players

182
0:08:54.224,000 --> 0:08:55,000
trying to shoot with one eye."

183
0:08:56.021,000 --> 0:08:57,000
The slash is interesting.

184
0:08:57.296,000 --> 0:09:,000
I don't really even know what Jake is talking about after that,

185
0:09:00.452,000 --> 0:09:04,000
but you notice that he's changing the topic.

186
0:09:05.193,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Now that seems kind of mundane,

187
0:09:07.011,000 --> 0:09:08,000
but think about how in real life,

188
0:09:08.453,000 --> 0:09:1,000
if we're having a conversation and we want to change the topic,

189
0:09:11.111,000 --> 0:09:12,000
there are ways of doing it gracefully.

190
0:09:12.723,000 --> 0:09:13,000
You don't just zip right into it.

191
0:09:14.442,000 --> 0:09:18,000
You'll pat your thighs and look wistfully off into the distance,

192
0:09:18.637,000 --> 0:09:22,000
or you'll say something like, "Hmm, makes you think --"

193
0:09:22.747,000 --> 0:09:24,000
when it really didn't, but what you're really --

194
0:09:25.107,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Laughter) —

195
0:09:27.342,000 --> 0:09:29,000
what you're really trying to do is change the topic.

196
0:09:30.05,000 --> 0:09:31,000
You can't do that while you're texting,

197
0:09:31.977,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and so ways are developing of doing it within this medium.

198
0:09:35.708,000 --> 0:09:37,000
All spoken languages have what a linguist calls

199
0:09:37.96,000 --> 0:09:4,000
a new information marker -- or two, or three.

200
0:09:41.353,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Texting has developed one from this slash.

201
0:09:45.647,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So we have a whole battery of new constructions

202
0:09:48.632,000 --> 0:09:5,000
that are developing, and yet it's easy to think,

203
0:09:51.219,000 --> 0:09:53,000
well, something is still wrong.

204
0:09:53.666,000 --> 0:09:56,000
There's a lack of structure of some sort.

205
0:09:57.441,000 --> 0:09:58,000
It's not as sophisticated

206
0:09:59.347,000 --> 0:10:01,000
as the language of The Wall Street Journal.

207
0:10:01.553,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Well, the fact of the matter is,

208
0:10:03.327,000 --> 0:10:05,000
look at this person in 1956,

209
0:10:05.778,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and this is when texting doesn't exist,

210
0:10:08.06,000 --> 0:10:09,000
"I Love Lucy" is still on the air.

211
0:10:09.895,000 --> 0:10:12,000
"Many do not know the alphabet or multiplication table,

212
0:10:13.658,000 --> 0:10:14,000
cannot write grammatically -- "

213
0:10:14.995,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We've heard that sort of thing before,

214
0:10:17.204,000 --> 0:10:2,000
not just in 1956. 1917, Connecticut schoolteacher.

215
0:10:21.195,000 --> 0:10:23,000
1917. This is the time when we all assume

216
0:10:23.896,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that everything somehow in terms of writing was perfect

217
0:10:27.147,000 --> 0:10:29,000
because the people on "Downton Abbey" are articulate,

218
0:10:29.565,000 --> 0:10:3,000
or something like that.

219
0:10:30.776,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So, "From every college in the country goes up the cry,

220
0:10:33.72,000 --> 0:10:35,000
'Our freshmen can't spell, can't punctuate.'"

221
0:10:36.353,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And so on. You can go even further back than this.

222
0:10:38.761,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It's the President of Harvard. It's 1871.

223
0:10:41.945,000 --> 0:10:43,000
There's no electricity. People have three names.

224
0:10:44.487,000 --> 0:10:46,000
"Bad spelling,

225
0:10:46.912,000 --> 0:10:49,000
incorrectness as well as inelegance of expression in writing."

226
0:10:50.18,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And he's talking about people who are otherwise

227
0:10:52.329,000 --> 0:10:53,000
well prepared for college studies.

228
0:10:54.22,000 --> 0:10:55,000
You can go even further back.

229
0:10:56.066,000 --> 0:10:59,000
1841, some long-lost superintendent of schools is upset

230
0:10:59.919,000 --> 0:11:02,000
because of what he has for a long time "noted with regret

231
0:11:03.096,000 --> 0:11:06,000
the almost entire neglect of the original" blah blah blah blah blah.

232
0:11:06.605,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Or you can go all the way back to 63 A.D. -- (Laughter) --

233
0:11:11.893,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and there's this poor man who doesn't like the way

234
0:11:14.274,000 --> 0:11:15,000
people are speaking Latin.

235
0:11:15.495,000 --> 0:11:18,000
As it happens, he was writing about what had become French.

236
0:11:18.651,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And so, there are always — (Laughter) (Applause) —

237
0:11:25.053,000 --> 0:11:27,000
there are always people worrying about these things

238
0:11:27.224,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and the planet somehow seems to keep spinning.

239
0:11:30.497,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And so, the way I'm thinking of texting these days is

240
0:11:35.144,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that what we're seeing is a whole new way of writing

241
0:11:38.724,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that young people are developing,

242
0:11:40.35,000 --> 0:11:43,000
which they're using alongside their ordinary writing skills,

243
0:11:44.11,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and that means that they're able to do two things.

244
0:11:47.277,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Increasing evidence is that being bilingual

245
0:11:50.174,000 --> 0:11:52,000
is cognitively beneficial.

246
0:11:52.407,000 --> 0:11:54,000
That's also true of being bidialectal.

247
0:11:54.562,000 --> 0:11:57,000
That's certainly true of being bidialectal in terms of your writing.

248
0:11:57.652,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And so texting actually is evidence of a balancing act

249
0:12:02.57,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that young people are using today, not consciously, of course,

250
0:12:05.872,000 --> 0:12:08,000
but it's an expansion of their linguistic repertoire.

251
0:12:09.559,000 --> 0:12:1,000
It's very simple.

252
0:12:10.788,000 --> 0:12:13,000
If somebody from 1973 looked at

253
0:12:14.498,000 --> 0:12:18,000
what was on a dormitory message board in 1993,

254
0:12:18.604,000 --> 0:12:19,000
the slang would have changed a little bit

255
0:12:20.437,000 --> 0:12:21,000
since the era of "Love Story,"

256
0:12:22.255,000 --> 0:12:25,000
but they would understand what was on that message board.

257
0:12:25.568,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Take that person from 1993 -- not that long ago,

258
0:12:28.292,000 --> 0:12:31,000
this is "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" -- those people.

259
0:12:31.55,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Take those people and they read

260
0:12:33.919,000 --> 0:12:35,000
a very typical text written by a 20-year-old today.

261
0:12:36.819,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Often they would have no idea what half of it meant

262
0:12:39.71,000 --> 0:12:42,000
because a whole new language has developed

263
0:12:43.638,000 --> 0:12:45,000
among our young people doing something as mundane

264
0:12:45.932,000 --> 0:12:47,000
as what it looks like to us when they're batting around

265
0:12:48.203,000 --> 0:12:49,000
on their little devices.

266
0:12:49.878,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So in closing, if I could go into the future,

267
0:12:53.539,000 --> 0:12:57,000
if I could go into 2033,

268
0:12:57.914,000 --> 0:12:59,000
the first thing I would ask is whether David Simon

269
0:13:00.827,000 --> 0:13:03,000
had done a sequel to "The Wire." I would want to know.

270
0:13:04.72,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And — I really would ask that —

271
0:13:07.703,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and then I'd want to know actually what was going on on "Downton Abbey."

272
0:13:10.793,000 --> 0:13:11,000
That'd be the second thing.

273
0:13:12.302,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And then the third thing would be,

274
0:13:14.838,000 --> 0:13:17,000
please show me a sheaf of texts

275
0:13:18.029,000 --> 0:13:19,000
written by 16-year-old girls,

276
0:13:19.986,000 --> 0:13:21,000
because I would want to know where this language

277
0:13:22.44,000 --> 0:13:23,000
had developed since our times,

278
0:13:24.395,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and ideally I would then send them back to you and me now

279
0:13:28.028,000 --> 0:13:3,000
so we could examine this linguistic miracle

280
0:13:30.548,000 --> 0:13:32,000
happening right under our noses.

281
0:13:32.898,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Thank you very much.

282
0:13:34.414,000 --> 0:13:39,000
(Applause)

283
0:13:39.582,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Thank you. (Applause)

1
0:00:12.557,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

2
0:00:14.255,000 --> 0:00:17,000
My name is Art Benjamin, and I am a "mathemagician."

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
What that means is, I combine my loves of math and magic

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
to do something I call "mathemagics."

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But before I get started, I have a quick question for the audience.

6
0:00:27.375,000 --> 0:00:28,000
By any chance, did anyone happen

7
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to bring with them this morning a calculator?

8
0:00:33.371,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Seriously, if you have a calculator with you, raise your hand.

9
0:00:36.46,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Raise your hand. Did your hand go up?

10
0:00:39.048,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now bring it out, bring it out. Anybody else?

11
0:00:41.327,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I see, I see one way in the back.

12
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
You sir, that's three.

13
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And anybody on this side here?

14
0:00:48.008,000 --> 0:00:49,000
OK, over there on the aisle.

15
0:00:49.532,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Would the four of you please bring out your calculators,

16
0:00:52.19,000 --> 0:00:53,000
then join me up on stage.

17
0:00:53.635,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Let's give them a nice round of applause.

18
0:00:55.899,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Applause)

19
0:00:58.736,000 --> 0:00:59,000
That's right.

20
0:00:59.845,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Now, since I haven't had the chance to work with these calculators,

21
0:01:03.283,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I need to make sure that they are all working properly.

22
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Would somebody get us started by giving us a two-digit number, please?

23
0:01:11.514,000 --> 0:01:12,000
How about a two-digit number?

24
0:01:13.047,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Audience: 22.

25
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
AB: 22. And another two-digit number, sir?

26
0:01:16.192,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Audience: 47.

27
0:01:17.223,000 --> 0:01:2,000
AB: Multiply 22 times 47, make sure you get 1,034,

28
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
or the calculators are not working.

29
0:01:22.921,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Do all of you get 1,034? 1,034?

30
0:01:26.089,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Volunteer: No.

31
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
AB: 594. Let's give three of them a nice round of applause there.

32
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Applause)

33
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Would you like to try a more standard calculator, just in case?

34
0:01:36.413,000 --> 0:01:37,000
OK, great.

35
0:01:37.549,000 --> 0:01:38,000
What I'm going to try and do then --

36
0:01:39.296,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I notice it took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer.

37
0:01:42.605,000 --> 0:01:43,000
That's OK.

38
0:01:43.63,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator.

39
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
There is something called the square of a number,

40
0:01:49.705,000 --> 0:01:52,000
which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself.

41
0:01:53.389,000 --> 0:01:54,000
For instance, five squared would be?

42
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Audience: 25.

43
0:01:56.191,000 --> 0:01:58,000
AB: 25. The way we can square on most calculators --

44
0:01:58.693,000 --> 0:01:59,000
let me demonstrate with this one --

45
0:02:00.408,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is by taking the number, such as five,

46
0:02:02.866,000 --> 0:02:04,000
hitting "times" and then "equals,"

47
0:02:05.6,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and on most calculators that will give you the square.

48
0:02:08.378,000 --> 0:02:1,000
On some of these ancient RPN calculators,

49
0:02:10.449,000 --> 0:02:12,000
you've got an "x squared" button on it,

50
0:02:12.651,000 --> 0:02:14,000
will allow you to do the calculation even faster.

51
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
What I'm going to try and do now is to square, in my head,

52
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
four two-digit numbers

53
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
faster than they can do on their calculators,

54
0:02:22.531,000 --> 0:02:23,000
even using the shortcut method.

55
0:02:24.399,000 --> 0:02:26,000
What I'll use is the second row this time,

56
0:02:26.565,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and I'll get four of you

57
0:02:28.097,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to each yell out a two-digit number,

58
0:02:29.898,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and if you would square the first number,

59
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and if you would square the second, the third and the fourth,

60
0:02:36.089,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I will try and race you to the answer. OK?

61
0:02:38.578,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So quickly, a two-digit number please.

62
0:02:41.161,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Audience: 37.

63
0:02:42.247,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Arthur Benjamin: 37 squared, OK.

64
0:02:44.136,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Audience: 23.

65
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
AB: 23 squared, OK.

66
0:02:46.692,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Audience: 59.

67
0:02:47.787,000 --> 0:02:49,000
AB: 59 squared, OK, and finally?

68
0:02:49.867,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Audience: 93.

69
0:02:50.916,000 --> 0:02:51,000
AB: 93 squared.

70
0:02:51.988,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Would you call out your answers, please?

71
0:02:54.924,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Volunteer: 1369. AB: 1369.

72
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Volunteer: 529. AB: 529.

73
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Volunteer: 3481. AB: 3481.

74
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Volunteer: 8649.

75
0:03:01.207,000 --> 0:03:02,000
AB: Thank you very much.

76
0:03:02.39,000 --> 0:03:07,000
(Applause)

77
0:03:07.527,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Let me try to take this one step further.

78
0:03:10.479,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I'm going to try to square some three-digit numbers this time.

79
0:03:13.524,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I won't even write these down --

80
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I'll just call them out as they're called out to me.

81
0:03:17.661,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Anyone I point to, call out a three-digit number.

82
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Anyone on our panel, verify the answer.

83
0:03:22.38,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Just give some indication if it's right.

84
0:03:24.427,000 --> 0:03:26,000
A three-digit number, sir, yes?

85
0:03:27.054,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Audience: 987.

86
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
AB: 987 squared is 974,169.

87
0:03:31.643,000 --> 0:03:33,000
(Laughter)

88
0:03:33.747,000 --> 0:03:34,000
AB: Yes? Good.

89
0:03:35.441,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Another three-digit --

90
0:03:37.161,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Applause)

91
0:03:39.115,000 --> 0:03:41,000
-- another three-digit number, sir?

92
0:03:41.577,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Audience: 457.

93
0:03:42.607,000 --> 0:03:45,000
AB: 457 squared is 205,849.

94
0:03:45.693,000 --> 0:03:46,000
205,849?

95
0:03:47.946,000 --> 0:03:48,000
AB: Yes?

96
0:03:48.972,000 --> 0:03:5,000
OK, another, another three-digit number, sir?

97
0:03:51.353,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Audience: 321.

98
0:03:52.401,000 --> 0:03:54,000
AB: 321 is 103,041.

99
0:03:55.05,000 --> 0:03:56,000
103,041.

100
0:03:57.485,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Yes? One more three-digit number please.

101
0:04:00.327,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Audience: Oh, 722.

102
0:04:01.509,000 --> 0:04:03,000
AB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one.

103
0:04:04.437,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Is that 513,284?

104
0:04:07.271,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Volunteer: Yes.

105
0:04:08.35,000 --> 0:04:1,000
AB: Yes? Oh, one more, one more three-digit number please.

106
0:04:11.263,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Audience: 162.

107
0:04:12.318,000 --> 0:04:15,000
162 squared is 26,244.

108
0:04:16.161,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Volunteer: Yes.

109
0:04:17.271,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Thank you very much.

110
0:04:18.304,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Applause)

111
0:04:23.763,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Applause ends)

112
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Let me try to take this one step further.

113
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Laughter)

114
0:04:29.572,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I'm going to try to square a four-digit number this time.

115
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
You can all take your time on this;

116
0:04:34.921,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I will not beat you to the answer on this one,

117
0:04:37.139,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but I will try to get the answer right.

118
0:04:39.065,000 --> 0:04:42,000
To make this a little bit more random, let's take the fourth row this time,

119
0:04:42.628,000 --> 0:04:43,000
let's say, one, two, three, four.

120
0:04:44.306,000 --> 0:04:47,000
If each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine,

121
0:04:47.504,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that will be the four-digit number that I'll square.

122
0:04:50.382,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Nine.

123
0:04:51.771,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Seven.

124
0:04:52.866,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Five.

125
0:04:54.335,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Eight.

126
0:04:55.398,000 --> 0:04:58,000
9,758, this will take me a little bit of time, so bear with me.

127
0:04:58.516,000 --> 0:05:,000
95 million --

128
0:05:01.167,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Sighs)

129
0:05:04.627,000 --> 0:05:07,000
218,564?

130
0:05:07.904,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Volunteer: Yes!

131
0:05:08.953,000 --> 0:05:09,000
AB: Thank you very much.

132
0:05:10.215,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Applause)

133
0:05:16.653,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Applause ends)

134
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Now, I would attempt to square a five-digit number --

135
0:05:21.445,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and I can --

136
0:05:22.978,000 --> 0:05:24,000
but unfortunately, most calculators cannot.

137
0:05:25.963,000 --> 0:05:26,000
(Laughter)

138
0:05:27.953,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Eight-digit capacity -- don't you hate that?

139
0:05:30.781,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So, since we've reached the limits of our calculators --

140
0:05:33.758,000 --> 0:05:34,000
what's that?

141
0:05:35.416,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Does yours go higher?

142
0:05:38.1,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Volunteer: I don't know.

143
0:05:39.321,000 --> 0:05:41,000
AB: Oh, yours does?

144
0:05:41.547,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Volunteer: I can probably do it. AB: I'll talk to you later.

145
0:05:44.479,000 --> 0:05:45,000
In the meanwhile, let me conclude

146
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier.

147
0:05:49.185,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Let's take the largest number on the board here, 8649.

148
0:05:52.695,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Would you each enter that on your calculator?

149
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And instead of squaring it this time,

150
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I want you to take that number and multiply it

151
0:05:59.375,000 --> 0:06:01,000
by any three-digit number that you want,

152
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but don't tell me what you're multiplying by --

153
0:06:04.423,000 --> 0:06:07,000
just multiply it by any random three-digit number.

154
0:06:07.726,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So you should have as an answer either

155
0:06:09.801,000 --> 0:06:12,000
a six-digit or probably a seven-digit number.

156
0:06:12.853,000 --> 0:06:14,000
How many digits do you have, six or seven?

157
0:06:14.927,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Seven, and yours?

158
0:06:16.205,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Seven? Seven?

159
0:06:20.022,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And, uncertain.

160
0:06:21.786,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Seven.

161
0:06:22.82,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Is there any possible way that I could know

162
0:06:24.9,000 --> 0:06:25,000
what seven-digit numbers you have?

163
0:06:26.6,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Say "No."

164
0:06:27.625,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Laughter)

165
0:06:28.964,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Good, then I shall attempt the impossible --

166
0:06:31.085,000 --> 0:06:33,000
or at least the improbable.

167
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
What I'd like each of you to do is to call out for me

168
0:06:35.708,000 --> 0:06:38,000
any six of your seven digits, any six of them,

169
0:06:38.744,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in any order you'd like.

170
0:06:40.891,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Laughter)

171
0:06:42.247,000 --> 0:06:43,000
One digit at a time,

172
0:06:43.694,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I shall try and determine the digit you've left out.

173
0:06:47.136,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Starting with your seven-digit number,

174
0:06:49.032,000 --> 0:06:5,000
call out any six of them please.

175
0:06:50.73,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Volunteer: 1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2.

176
0:06:56.105,000 --> 0:06:57,000
AB: Did you leave out the number 6?

177
0:06:57.819,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Good, OK, that's one.

178
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
You have a seven-digit number, call out any six of them please.

179
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Volunteer: 4, 4, 8, 7, 5.

180
0:07:05.533,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I think I only heard five numbers. I -- wait -- 44875 --

181
0:07:09.948,000 --> 0:07:1,000
did you leave out the number 6?

182
0:07:11.481,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Same as she did, OK.

183
0:07:12.595,000 --> 0:07:13,000
You've got a seven-digit number --

184
0:07:14.247,000 --> 0:07:16,000
call out any six of them loud and clear.

185
0:07:16.704,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Volunteer: 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4.

186
0:07:20.42,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I think you left out the number 3?

187
0:07:22.994,000 --> 0:07:23,000
AB: That's three.

188
0:07:24.125,000 --> 0:07:27,000
The odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing

189
0:07:27.311,000 --> 0:07:29,000
would be one in 10,000: 10 to the fourth power.

190
0:07:29.834,000 --> 0:07:3,000
OK, any six of them.

191
0:07:31.423,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Laughter)

192
0:07:32.501,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Really scramble them up this time, please.

193
0:07:34.794,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Volunteer: 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2.

194
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Did you leave out the number 7?

195
0:07:39.978,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And let's give all four of these people a nice round of applause.

196
0:07:43.222,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Thank you very much.

197
0:07:44.78,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Applause)

198
0:07:50.322,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Applause ends)

199
0:07:53.013,000 --> 0:07:54,000
For my next number --

200
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Laughter)

201
0:07:57.132,000 --> 0:07:59,000
while I mentally recharge my batteries,

202
0:08:00.02,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I have one more question for the audience.

203
0:08:02.692,000 --> 0:08:06,000
By any chance, does anybody here happen to know

204
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
the day of the week that they were born on?

205
0:08:10.518,000 --> 0:08:13,000
If you think you know your birth day, raise your hand.

206
0:08:14.462,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Let's see, starting with -- let's start with a gentleman first.

207
0:08:17.676,000 --> 0:08:18,000
What year was it, first of all?

208
0:08:19.351,000 --> 0:08:2,000
That's why I pick a gentleman first.

209
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Audience: 1953.

210
0:08:22.247,000 --> 0:08:23,000
1953, and the month?

211
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
November what?

212
0:08:26.35,000 --> 0:08:27,000
23rd -- was that a Monday?

213
0:08:28.094,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Audience: Yes.

214
0:08:29.119,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Good. Somebody else?

215
0:08:30.524,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I haven't seen any women's hands up.

216
0:08:32.365,000 --> 0:08:33,000
OK, how about you, what year?

217
0:08:34.904,000 --> 0:08:35,000
1949, and the month?

218
0:08:36.746,000 --> 0:08:37,000
October what?

219
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Fifth -- was that a Wednesday?

220
0:08:39.89,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Yes! I'll go way to the back right now, how about you?

221
0:08:42.438,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Yell it out, what year?

222
0:08:43.655,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Audience: 1959.

223
0:08:44.767,000 --> 0:08:46,000
1959, OK -- and the month?

224
0:08:47.555,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Audience: February.

225
0:08:48.674,000 --> 0:08:49,000
February what?

226
0:08:50.105,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Sixth -- was that a Friday? Audience: Yes.

227
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Good, how about the person behind her?

228
0:08:54.413,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Call out, what year was it?

229
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Audience: 1947. AB: 1947, and the month?

230
0:08:58.85,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Audience: May. AB: May what?

231
0:09:00.294,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday?

232
0:09:02.389,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Audience: Yes. AB: Thank you very much.

233
0:09:04.739,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Applause)

234
0:09:09.767,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Anybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born?

235
0:09:12.965,000 --> 0:09:13,000
We can do it that way.

236
0:09:14.133,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Of course, I could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know,

237
0:09:17.167,000 --> 0:09:18,000
so I come prepared for that.

238
0:09:18.532,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I brought with me a book of calendars.

239
0:09:21.714,000 --> 0:09:25,000
It goes as far back into the past as 1800, because you never know.

240
0:09:25.983,000 --> 0:09:26,000
(Laughter)

241
0:09:27.534,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I didn't mean to look at you, sir -- you were just sitting there.

242
0:09:30.675,000 --> 0:09:31,000
(Laughter)

243
0:09:31.773,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Anyway, Chris, you can help me out here, if you wouldn't mind.

244
0:09:34.749,000 --> 0:09:35,000
This is a book of calendars.

245
0:09:36.644,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Who wanted to know their birth day?

246
0:09:38.46,000 --> 0:09:39,000
What year was it, first of all?

247
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Audience: 1966.

248
0:09:41.215,000 --> 0:09:43,000
66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966.

249
0:09:43.929,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And what month?

250
0:09:45.477,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Audience: April. AB: April what?

251
0:09:47.136,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Audience: 17th.

252
0:09:48.181,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I believe that was a Sunday.

253
0:09:50.509,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Can you confirm, Chris?

254
0:09:53.043,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Chris Anderson: Yes.

255
0:09:54.117,000 --> 0:09:55,000
AB: I'll tell you what, Chris:

256
0:09:55.659,000 --> 0:09:57,000
as long as you have that book in front of you,

257
0:09:57.872,000 --> 0:10:,000
do me a favor, turn to a year outside of the 1900s,

258
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
either into the 1800s or way into the 2000s --

259
0:10:04.021,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that'll be a much greater challenge for me.

260
0:10:06.077,000 --> 0:10:08,000
AB: What year would you like? CA: 1824.

261
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
AB: 1824, OK.

262
0:10:11.389,000 --> 0:10:12,000
AB: And what month?

263
0:10:13.001,000 --> 0:10:14,000
CA: June.

264
0:10:14.088,000 --> 0:10:15,000
AB: June what? CA: Sixth.

265
0:10:15.36,000 --> 0:10:17,000
AB: Was that a Sunday?

266
0:10:17.744,000 --> 0:10:18,000
CA: It was. AB: And it was cloudy.

267
0:10:19.642,000 --> 0:10:2,000
(Laughter)

268
0:10:20.975,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Good, thank you very much.

269
0:10:22.705,000 --> 0:10:23,000
(Applause)

270
0:10:27.298,000 --> 0:10:28,000
(Applause ends)

271
0:10:28.831,000 --> 0:10:29,000
But I'd like to wrap things up now

272
0:10:30.479,000 --> 0:10:34,000
by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation.

273
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
There was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator.

274
0:10:38.507,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Where is he, would you stand up,

275
0:10:41.333,000 --> 0:10:42,000
10-digit guy?

276
0:10:44.94,000 --> 0:10:46,000
OK, stand up for me just for a second,

277
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
so I can see where you are.

278
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
You have a 10-digit calculator, sir, as well?

279
0:10:52.314,000 --> 0:10:55,000
OK, what I'm going to try and do, is to square in my head

280
0:10:55.868,000 --> 0:10:58,000
a five-digit number requiring a 10-digit calculator.

281
0:10:59.272,000 --> 0:11:03,000
But to make my job more interesting for you, as well as for me,

282
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I'm going to do this problem thinking out loud.

283
0:11:08.056,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So you can actually, honestly hear

284
0:11:10.945,000 --> 0:11:14,000
what's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size.

285
0:11:15.687,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Now, I have to apologize to our magician friend Lennart Green.

286
0:11:18.991,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I know as a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets,

287
0:11:22.087,000 --> 0:11:23,000
but I'm not too afraid

288
0:11:23.373,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that people are going to start doing my show next week, so --

289
0:11:26.28,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I think we're OK.

290
0:11:27.867,000 --> 0:11:28,000
(Laughter)

291
0:11:29.037,000 --> 0:11:3,000
(Applause)

292
0:11:30.317,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So, let's see,

293
0:11:32.992,000 --> 0:11:34,000
let's take a different row of people, starting with you.

294
0:11:35.959,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I'll get five digits: one, two, three, four.

295
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Oh, I did this row already.

296
0:11:39.502,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Let's do the row before you,

297
0:11:40.945,000 --> 0:11:42,000
starting with you: one, two, three, four, five.

298
0:11:43.238,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Call out a single digit --

299
0:11:44.573,000 --> 0:11:47,000
that will be the five-digit number that I will try to square, go ahead.

300
0:11:49.396,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Five.

301
0:11:50.983,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Seven.

302
0:11:52.033,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Six.

303
0:11:53.134,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Eight.

304
0:11:54.636,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Three.

305
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
57,683 --

306
0:12:00.739,000 --> 0:12:01,000
squared.

307
0:12:01.852,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Yuck.

308
0:12:03.496,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Let me explain to you how I'm going to attempt this problem.

309
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
I'm going to break the problem down into three parts.

310
0:12:11.054,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I'll do 57,000 squared,

311
0:12:13.726,000 --> 0:12:16,000
plus 683 squared,

312
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
plus 57,000 times 683 times two.

313
0:12:22.643,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Add all those numbers together,

314
0:12:24.761,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and with any luck, arrive at the answer.

315
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Now, let me recap.

316
0:12:30.006,000 --> 0:12:31,000
(Laughter)

317
0:12:31.5,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Thank you.

318
0:12:32.659,000 --> 0:12:33,000
(Laughter)

319
0:12:34.556,000 --> 0:12:35,000
While I explain something else --

320
0:12:36.453,000 --> 0:12:37,000
(Laughter)

321
0:12:37.707,000 --> 0:12:39,000
-- I know, that you can use, right?

322
0:12:39.842,000 --> 0:12:4,000
(Laughter)

323
0:12:40.871,000 --> 0:12:41,000
While I do these calculations,

324
0:12:42.642,000 --> 0:12:44,000
you might hear certain words,

325
0:12:45.145,000 --> 0:12:47,000
as opposed to numbers, creep into the calculation.

326
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Let me explain what that is.

327
0:12:49.582,000 --> 0:12:51,000
This is a phonetic code,

328
0:12:51.688,000 --> 0:12:53,000
a mnemonic device that I use,

329
0:12:53.788,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that allows me to convert numbers into words.

330
0:12:56.622,000 --> 0:12:59,000
I store them as words, and later on retrieve them as numbers.

331
0:12:59.788,000 --> 0:13:,000
I know it sounds complicated; it's not.

332
0:13:01.773,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I don't want you to think you're seeing something out of "Rain Man."

333
0:13:05.129,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Laughter)

334
0:13:06.2,000 --> 0:13:08,000
There's definitely a method to my madness --

335
0:13:08.28,000 --> 0:13:09,000
definitely, definitely.

336
0:13:09.532,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Sorry.

337
0:13:10.557,000 --> 0:13:13,000
(Laughter)

338
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
If you want to talk to me about ADHD afterwards,

339
0:13:16.429,000 --> 0:13:17,000
you can talk to me then.

340
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
By the way, one last instruction,

341
0:13:20.564,000 --> 0:13:22,000
for my judges with the calculators --

342
0:13:22.94,000 --> 0:13:23,000
you know who you are --

343
0:13:24.106,000 --> 0:13:29,000
there is at least a 50 percent chance that I will make a mistake here.

344
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
If I do, don't tell me what the mistake is;

345
0:13:32.612,000 --> 0:13:34,000
just say, "you're close," or something like that,

346
0:13:34.968,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and I'll try and figure out the answer --

347
0:13:36.968,000 --> 0:13:38,000
which could be pretty entertaining in itself.

348
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
If, however, I am right,

349
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
whatever you do, don't keep it to yourself, OK?

350
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
(Laughter)

351
0:13:45.39,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right,

352
0:13:48.628,000 --> 0:13:49,000
because this is my big finish, OK.

353
0:13:50.338,000 --> 0:13:53,000
So, without any more stalling,

354
0:13:53.552,000 --> 0:13:55,000
here we go.

355
0:13:56.527,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I'll start the problem in the middle, with 57 times 683.

356
0:13:59.241,000 --> 0:14:02,000
57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876,

357
0:14:02.407,000 --> 0:14:04,000
that's 38,760 plus 171,

358
0:14:04.701,000 --> 0:14:06,000
38,760 plus 171 is 38,931.

359
0:14:07.55,000 --> 0:14:1,000
38,931; double that to get 77,862.

360
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
77,862 becomes cookie fission,

361
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
cookie fission is 77,822.

362
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
That seems right, I'll go on. Cookie fission, OK.

363
0:14:19.518,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Next, I do 57 squared, which is 3,249, so I can say,

364
0:14:23.788,000 --> 0:14:24,000
three billion.

365
0:14:25.542,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249,

366
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
oops, but I see a carry coming --

367
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
249 --

368
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
add that to cookie, 250 plus 77,

369
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
is 327 million --

370
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
fission, fission, OK, finally, we do 683 squared,

371
0:14:41.167,000 --> 0:14:43,000
that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared

372
0:14:43.526,000 --> 0:14:45,000
is 466,489, rev up if I need it,

373
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
rev up, take the 466,

374
0:14:48.565,000 --> 0:14:51,000
add that to fission, to get,

375
0:14:51.716,000 --> 0:14:53,000
oh gee --

376
0:14:53.748,000 --> 0:14:57,000
328,489.

377
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Audience: Yeah! AB: Good.

378
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Thank you very much.

379
0:15:01.54,000 --> 0:15:02,000
(Applause)

380
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
I hope you enjoyed mathemagics.

381
0:15:04.673,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Thank you.

382
0:15:05.698,000 --> 0:15:07,000
(Applause)

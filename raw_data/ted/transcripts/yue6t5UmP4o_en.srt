0:00:13.44,000 --> 0:00:16,000
2014, July 5,

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the Ukrainian army entered Sloviansk city in eastern Ukraine.

3
0:00:21.88,000 --> 0:00:24,000
They gathered all the locals in Lenin Square.

4
0:00:25.84,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Then, they organized the public crucifixion

5
0:00:30.08,000 --> 0:00:33,000
of the son of a pro-Russia militant.

6
0:00:33.28,000 --> 0:00:35,000
He was only three years old.

7
0:00:36.44,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Refugee Galina Pyshnyak told this story to Russia's First TV channel.

8
0:00:42.96,000 --> 0:00:46,000
In fact, this incident never happened.

9
0:00:47.04,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I visited Sloviansk.

10
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
There is no Lenin Square.

11
0:00:51.52,000 --> 0:00:57,000
In reality, Galina's husband was an active pro-Russia militant in Donbass.

12
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:01,000
This is just one of many examples.

13
0:01:01.2,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Ukraine has been suffering from Russian propaganda and fake news

14
0:01:05.12,000 --> 0:01:07,000
for four years now,

15
0:01:07.56,000 --> 0:01:11,000
but Russia is not the only player in this space.

16
0:01:11.96,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Fake news is happening all around the world.

17
0:01:16.04,000 --> 0:01:17,000
We all know about fake news.

18
0:01:17.92,000 --> 0:01:2,000
We see it and read it all the time.

19
0:01:21.08,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But the thing about fake news

20
0:01:23.64,000 --> 0:01:27,000
is that we don't always know what is fake and what is real,

21
0:01:27.84,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but we base our decisions on facts we get from the press and social media.

22
0:01:33.8,000 --> 0:01:35,000
When facts are false,

23
0:01:35.88,000 --> 0:01:36,000
decisions are wrong.

24
0:01:38.56,000 --> 0:01:41,000
A lot of people stop believing anyone at all

25
0:01:42.08,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and this is even more dangerous.

26
0:01:44.84,000 --> 0:01:47,000
They easily become prey to populists in elections,

27
0:01:48.8,000 --> 0:01:49,000
or even take up arms.

28
0:01:51.76,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Fake news is not only bad for journalism.

29
0:01:54.32,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It's a threat for democracy and society.

30
0:01:58.96,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Four years ago, unmarked soldiers

31
0:02:02.44,000 --> 0:02:04,000
entered the Crimean Peninsula,

32
0:02:05.24,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and at the same time,

33
0:02:06.88,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Russian media was going crazy with fake news about Ukraine.

34
0:02:12.2,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So a group of journalists, including me,

35
0:02:15.72,000 --> 0:02:18,000
started a website to investigate this fake news.

36
0:02:19.68,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We called it StopFake.

37
0:02:22.6,000 --> 0:02:23,000
The idea was simple:

38
0:02:24.24,000 --> 0:02:28,000
take a piece of news, check it with verifiable proof

39
0:02:28.6,000 --> 0:02:31,000
like photos, videos and other strong evidence.

40
0:02:32.12,000 --> 0:02:35,000
If it turns out to be fake, we put it on our website.

41
0:02:36.6,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Now, StopFake is an informational hub

42
0:02:40.24,000 --> 0:02:43,000
which analyzes propaganda in all its phases.

43
0:02:44.6,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We have 11 language versions, we have millions of views,

44
0:02:49.44,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We have taught more than 10,000 people

45
0:02:52.6,000 --> 0:02:55,000
how to distinguish true from false.

46
0:02:55.64,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And we teach fact checkers all around the world.

47
0:03:00.76,000 --> 0:03:05,000
StopFake has uncovered more than 1,000 fakes about Ukraine.

48
0:03:06.88,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We've identified 18 narratives

49
0:03:10.84,000 --> 0:03:12,000
created using this fake news,

50
0:03:13.4,000 --> 0:03:16,000
such as Ukraine is a fascist state,

51
0:03:17.04,000 --> 0:03:18,000
a failed state,

52
0:03:18.56,000 --> 0:03:22,000
a state run by a junta who came to power as a result of a coup d'état.

53
0:03:23.44,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We proved that it's not bad journalism;

54
0:03:26.24,000 --> 0:03:28,000
it's a deliberate act of misinformation.

55
0:03:29.8,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Fake news is a powerful weapon in information warfare,

56
0:03:33.28,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but there is something we can do about it.

57
0:03:37.08,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We all have smartphones.

58
0:03:39.04,000 --> 0:03:42,000
When we see something interesting, it's often automatic.

59
0:03:42.52,000 --> 0:03:43,000
We just click and pass it along.

60
0:03:45.4,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But how can you not be a part of fake news?

61
0:03:48.68,000 --> 0:03:54,000
First, if it's too dramatic, too emotional, too clickbait,

62
0:03:56.24,000 --> 0:03:58,000
then it's very likely that it isn't true.

63
0:04:00.32,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The truth is boring sometimes.

64
0:04:02.68,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Laughter)

65
0:04:04.08,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Manipulations are always sexy.

66
0:04:07.04,000 --> 0:04:09,000
They are designed to captivate you.

67
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Do your research.

68
0:04:11.8,000 --> 0:04:13,000
This is the second point, very simple.

69
0:04:14.64,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Look at other sites.

70
0:04:16.48,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Check out alternative news sources.

71
0:04:19.12,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Google names, addresses, license plates, experts and authors.

72
0:04:24.56,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Don't just believe, check.

73
0:04:26.84,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It's the only way to stop this culture of fake news.

74
0:04:31.64,000 --> 0:04:34,000
This information warfare is not only about fake news.

75
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Our society depends on trust:

76
0:04:38.84,000 --> 0:04:39,000
trust in our institutions,

77
0:04:40.72,000 --> 0:04:41,000
in science,

78
0:04:42.12,000 --> 0:04:44,000
trust in our leaders,

79
0:04:44.2,000 --> 0:04:46,000
trust in our news outlets.

80
0:04:47.32,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And it's on us to find a way to rebuild trust,

81
0:04:52.4,000 --> 0:04:54,000
because fake news destroys it.

82
0:04:55.32,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So ask yourself,

83
0:04:57.44,000 --> 0:04:59,000
what have you lost your faith in?

84
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Where has trust been ruined for you?

85
0:05:04.6,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And what are you going to do about it?

86
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Thank you.

87
0:05:09.4,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Applause)

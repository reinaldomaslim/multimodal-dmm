2
0:00:13.451,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Human origins.

3
0:00:15.225,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Who are we?

4
0:00:16.741,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Where do we come from,

5
0:00:18.349,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and how do we know?

6
0:00:20.391,000 --> 0:00:22,000
In my field, paleoanthropology,

7
0:00:22.96,000 --> 0:00:23,000
we explore human origins --

8
0:00:24.756,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the "who" and "where" questions --

9
0:00:26.843,000 --> 0:00:29,000
by analyzing fossils that date back thousands and even millions of years.

10
0:00:32.085,000 --> 0:00:37,000
In 2015, a team of colleagues and I named a new species in the genus Homo --

11
0:00:37.705,000 --> 0:00:38,000
our genus --

12
0:00:39.329,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Homo naledi.

13
0:00:42.669,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Let's take a step back and put that into context.

14
0:00:47.019,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The last common ancestors between humans and chimps

15
0:00:50.004,000 --> 0:00:52,000
date somewhere between six and eight million years.

16
0:00:54.071,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The earliest hominins,

17
0:00:56.02,000 --> 0:00:57,000
or earliest human ancestors,

18
0:00:57.985,000 --> 0:00:59,000
evolved into a group known as the australopithecines.

19
0:01:01.844,000 --> 0:01:04,000
The australopithecines evolved into the genus Homo

20
0:01:05.211,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and eventually modern humans -- us.

21
0:01:09.152,000 --> 0:01:11,000
With each new fossil discovery,

22
0:01:11.52,000 --> 0:01:14,000
we get a little bit closer to better understanding who we are

23
0:01:15.533,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and where we came from.

24
0:01:17.653,000 --> 0:01:19,000
With these new fossil finds,

25
0:01:19.689,000 --> 0:01:21,000
we realize we now have to make changes to this tree.

26
0:01:24.835,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Until this discovery,

27
0:01:26.529,000 --> 0:01:29,000
we thought we had a pretty good idea about the patterns of evolutionary change.

28
0:01:31.389,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Current fossil evidence suggests

29
0:01:33.177,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that the earliest populations of the genus Homo evolved in Africa

30
0:01:36.952,000 --> 0:01:38,000
somewhere between two and three million years.

31
0:01:39.787,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Fast-forward to approximately 300,000 years to where we see the origins

32
0:01:43.774,000 --> 0:01:44,000
of the first modern humans.

33
0:01:46.106,000 --> 0:01:48,000
While the fossil record between these time frames in Africa

34
0:01:49.085,000 --> 0:01:51,000
is relatively sparse,

35
0:01:51.277,000 --> 0:01:54,000
the fossils nonetheless demonstrated certain trends

36
0:01:54.804,000 --> 0:01:56,000
from our earliest ancestors to modern humans.

37
0:01:58.822,000 --> 0:02:,000
For example, our brains were becoming larger

38
0:02:01.291,000 --> 0:02:02,000
relative the rest of our body.

39
0:02:03.417,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Our pelves were becoming more bowl-shaped,

40
0:02:06.161,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and our hand-wrist morphology, or form,

41
0:02:09.221,000 --> 0:02:13,000
suggested a change in our grip as we began to make and use stone tools

42
0:02:13.6,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and spend less time in the trees.

43
0:02:16.777,000 --> 0:02:21,000
These new fossils disrupt everything we thought we knew about these trends

44
0:02:22.424,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and force us to change the way that we think about human evolution.

45
0:02:28.745,000 --> 0:02:29,000
South Africa in general,

46
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
but the Cradle of Humankind in particular,

47
0:02:32.327,000 --> 0:02:35,000
contains numerous sites where hundreds of thousands of fossils have been found.

48
0:02:36.729,000 --> 0:02:39,000
As an undergraduate student, I fell in love with one of them ...

49
0:02:40.259,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Mrs. Ples.

50
0:02:41.436,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The skull of a 2.1-million-year-old early human ancestor.

51
0:02:45.561,000 --> 0:02:46,000
From that point on,

52
0:02:46.743,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I was determined to go to South Africa and study human evolution.

53
0:02:50.601,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I first traveled there in 2003,

54
0:02:52.823,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and I did get to see my beloved Mrs. Ples.

55
0:02:55.371,000 --> 0:02:56,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:56.535,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But words can hardly convey my excitement

57
0:02:59.56,000 --> 0:03:02,000
when I was chosen as an early career scientist

58
0:03:02.982,000 --> 0:03:03,000
by Lee Berger,

59
0:03:04.293,000 --> 0:03:06,000
a world-renowned paleoanthropologist,

60
0:03:06.744,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to be one of the primary analysts of recently excavated unpublished fossils.

61
0:03:13.76,000 --> 0:03:17,000
This treasure trove of fossils was being recovered from a new site

62
0:03:18.194,000 --> 0:03:21,000
called the Dinaledi Chamber in the Rising Star cave system.

63
0:03:23.094,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Species are often named based on a skull, a lower jaw,

64
0:03:27.133,000 --> 0:03:28,000
or, very rarely,

65
0:03:28.514,000 --> 0:03:31,000
a handful of postcranial, or below-the-neck, elements.

66
0:03:32.838,000 --> 0:03:34,000
The fossils from Dinaledi were another story altogether.

67
0:03:36.462,000 --> 0:03:39,000
An unprecedented approximately 1800 specimens --

68
0:03:40.08,000 --> 0:03:41,000
so far --

69
0:03:41.514,000 --> 0:03:43,000
have been excavated from the Rising Star system,

70
0:03:44.251,000 --> 0:03:46,000
representing at least 15 individual skeletons.

71
0:03:50.009,000 --> 0:03:52,000
The research team that I was invited to join

72
0:03:52.363,000 --> 0:03:55,000
was tasked with describing, comparing and analyzing the fossils,

73
0:03:56.155,000 --> 0:04:,000
with the difficult goal of identifying to what species the fossils belonged.

74
0:04:01.59,000 --> 0:04:03,000
We were divided up into our different areas of expertise.

75
0:04:04.925,000 --> 0:04:06,000
We were divided up in different areas of the lab, too.

76
0:04:07.492,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So there was "Hand Land," for the fossil hand people,

77
0:04:11.014,000 --> 0:04:12,000
"Hip Heaven" for the pelvis ...

78
0:04:13.457,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I was in the "Tooth Booth."

79
0:04:15.154,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:16.706,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And after long, intense days in the lab,

81
0:04:19.43,000 --> 0:04:22,000
the different teams would meet up at night and discuss our findings,

82
0:04:22.689,000 --> 0:04:25,000
still consumed by questions from our analyses.

83
0:04:25.789,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It was incredible how different the interpretations were.

84
0:04:29.137,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Each body part seemed to come from a different species,

85
0:04:32.347,000 --> 0:04:34,000
based on what we knew from the fossil record.

86
0:04:35.3,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The suite of characteristics we were seeing didn't match any known species.

87
0:04:40.63,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And if we had only recovered the skull, we might have called it one thing;

88
0:04:44.139,000 --> 0:04:47,000
if we had only recovered the pelvis, we might have called it another.

89
0:04:48.388,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The anatomy of the skeletons didn't make sense

90
0:04:51.293,000 --> 0:04:54,000
with the framework of what we thought we knew of human evolution.

91
0:04:55.898,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Did it belong in the genus Homo?

92
0:04:58.108,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Should it be an australopithecine?

93
0:05:00.041,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Those bipedal, more apelike ancestors?

94
0:05:03.036,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Or perhaps it should be its own species.

95
0:05:06.11,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Ultimately, after much deliberation,

96
0:05:09.082,000 --> 0:05:13,000
we decided the Rising Star specimens did indeed warrant a new species,

97
0:05:13.224,000 --> 0:05:14,000
which we called "Homo naledi."

98
0:05:16.934,000 --> 0:05:17,000
From the head to the feet,

99
0:05:18.514,000 --> 0:05:21,000
the fossils present a mosaic of primitive, or ancestral,

100
0:05:22.139,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and derived or more modern-like features.

101
0:05:25.039,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The skull is quite derived,

102
0:05:28.166,000 --> 0:05:31,000
appearing most similar to early representatives of the genus Homo,

103
0:05:31.83,000 --> 0:05:33,000
like Homo habilis and Homo erectus.

104
0:05:35.001,000 --> 0:05:39,000
However, the brain is scarcely half the size of a modern human one.

105
0:05:39.84,000 --> 0:05:42,000
One that is smaller than any other early Homo that has ever been found.

106
0:05:45.437,000 --> 0:05:46,000
As someone who studies teeth,

107
0:05:47.292,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I might argue these are the coolest fossils found at the site.

108
0:05:50.221,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Laughter)

109
0:05:51.295,000 --> 0:05:54,000
The assemblage consists of 190 whole or fragmentary teeth

110
0:05:54.583,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that range in age from very old to very young.

111
0:05:58.501,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Like the skeletons,

112
0:05:59.777,000 --> 0:06:01,000
the teeth present a mix of primitive and derived traits.

113
0:06:03.444,000 --> 0:06:04,000
In modern humans,

114
0:06:04.961,000 --> 0:06:08,000
the third molar is typically the smallest, while the first molar is the biggest,

115
0:06:09.624,000 --> 0:06:11,000
but Homo naledi has the primitive condition

116
0:06:11.789,000 --> 0:06:14,000
where the third molar is the biggest and the first molar is the smallest.

117
0:06:16.111,000 --> 0:06:17,000
The anterior teeth,

118
0:06:17.286,000 --> 0:06:19,000
or the incisors and canines,

119
0:06:19.411,000 --> 0:06:21,000
are small for the genus Homo,

120
0:06:22.308,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and the lower canine has a cuspulid on it --

121
0:06:25.471,000 --> 0:06:29,000
an extra cuspule that gives it a distinct mitten-like shape

122
0:06:29.551,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that it shares with some specimens of the early human, Homo erectus.

123
0:06:35.744,000 --> 0:06:38,000
The overall shape of the teeth looked odd to me,

124
0:06:38.994,000 --> 0:06:4,000
so I performed crown-shape analysis

125
0:06:41.544,000 --> 0:06:45,000
on the occlusal surfaces of deciduous teeth, or baby teeth --

126
0:06:46.115,000 --> 0:06:47,000
on your left --

127
0:06:47.554,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and the permanent premolars and molars on your right.

128
0:06:51.672,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The deciduous teeth are especially narrow,

129
0:06:55.006,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and the premolars are unique in their outline shape

130
0:06:58.442,000 --> 0:06:59,000
compared to other hominids.

131
0:07:00.577,000 --> 0:07:02,000
In fact, when I compare the outlines,

132
0:07:03.055,000 --> 0:07:04,000
when I lay them on top of each other,

133
0:07:04.967,000 --> 0:07:05,000
they look very similar.

134
0:07:07.203,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We say they have "low intraspecific variations,"

135
0:07:10.112,000 --> 0:07:12,000
so the variation within the species is low.

136
0:07:12.395,000 --> 0:07:14,000
When I compare this to groups like the australopithecines,

137
0:07:15.346,000 --> 0:07:17,000
the intraspecific variation is much larger.

138
0:07:20.172,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Postcranially, the team concluded

139
0:07:22.431,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that the position of the shoulders suggesting naledi was a climber;

140
0:07:25.845,000 --> 0:07:29,000
the flared pelvis and curved fingers are all primitive for the genus Homo.

141
0:07:31.554,000 --> 0:07:32,000
On the other hand,

142
0:07:33.039,000 --> 0:07:37,000
the humanlike wrist, long slender legs and modern feet

143
0:07:37.474,000 --> 0:07:39,000
are all consistent with other members of the genus.

144
0:07:42.992,000 --> 0:07:46,000
In 2017, we announced more specimens of Homo naledi

145
0:07:47.737,000 --> 0:07:48,000
from the nearby Lesedi Chamber,

146
0:07:49.757,000 --> 0:07:5,000
also in the Rising Star cave system.

147
0:07:52.439,000 --> 0:07:55,000
In addition, our geology team managed to produce an age estimate.

148
0:07:57.15,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The date's a big deal because, up until now,

149
0:08:00.168,000 --> 0:08:04,000
we had based our analysis solely on the morphology of the specimens,

150
0:08:04.952,000 --> 0:08:06,000
without previous knowledge of how old something is --

151
0:08:07.576,000 --> 0:08:1,000
something which could unconsciously bias our interpretations.

152
0:08:11.623,000 --> 0:08:14,000
With its small brain and flared pelvis,

153
0:08:14.672,000 --> 0:08:15,000
we would not have been surprised

154
0:08:16.221,000 --> 0:08:18,000
if the fossils turned out to be two million years old.

155
0:08:19.171,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Instead, the fossils dated

156
0:08:21.472,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to 235 to 336 thousand years,

157
0:08:26.302,000 --> 0:08:28,000
an incredibly young date for such a small-brained individual.

158
0:08:29.889,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So think back to what I said earlier:

159
0:08:31.676,000 --> 0:08:34,000
we thought that our brains were becoming larger relative to the rest of our body.

160
0:08:35.564,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Now we have a small-brained, young individual complicating this idea.

161
0:08:41.122,000 --> 0:08:42,000
What does all this mean?

162
0:08:44.097,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Homo naledi has taught us

163
0:08:45.491,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that we need to reassess what it means to be in the genus Homo.

164
0:08:49.217,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We need to rethink what it means to be human.

165
0:08:51.986,000 --> 0:08:55,000
In fact, most of the characteristics that we use to define the genus Homo,

166
0:08:56.254,000 --> 0:08:58,000
such as brain size and hip morphology,

167
0:08:58.927,000 --> 0:08:59,000
are no longer valid.

168
0:09:01.235,000 --> 0:09:05,000
No other species exists with this mix of primitive and derived traits.

169
0:09:07.127,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Why is there so much morphological variation in the genus Homo?

170
0:09:10.273,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And what force is driving that variation?

171
0:09:14.172,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Another implication for these fossils is that for the first time,

172
0:09:17.819,000 --> 0:09:2,000
we have concrete evidence of a species coexisting in Africa,

173
0:09:21.791,000 --> 0:09:22,000
at 300,000 years,

174
0:09:23.054,000 --> 0:09:24,000
with modern humans.

175
0:09:25.029,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Until this discovery,

176
0:09:26.375,000 --> 0:09:3,000
we only had large-brained modern humans that existed in Africa.

177
0:09:33.091,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Did they interbreed with each other?

178
0:09:35.208,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Did they compete with each other?

179
0:09:38.906,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Another implication that these fossils have

180
0:09:42.339,000 --> 0:09:45,000
is for the archaeologists studying stone tools in South Africa.

181
0:09:45.924,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Keep in mind that neither the Dinaledi nor the Lesedi Chambers

182
0:09:49.204,000 --> 0:09:5,000
have any artifacts in them.

183
0:09:51.489,000 --> 0:09:55,000
However, they do overlap in time with several stone-tool industries,

184
0:09:56.019,000 --> 0:09:59,000
the makers of which are considered to be either modern humans

185
0:09:59.936,000 --> 0:10:,000
or direct human ancestors.

186
0:10:02.645,000 --> 0:10:03,000
This begs the question:

187
0:10:04.261,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Who made the stone tools of South Africa?

188
0:10:07.369,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Brain size has historically played a key role

189
0:10:09.572,000 --> 0:10:11,000
in identifying a species as a tool user.

190
0:10:12.125,000 --> 0:10:14,000
The idea is that you need to have a large brain

191
0:10:14.34,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to have even the capacity to make stone tools.

192
0:10:17.053,000 --> 0:10:18,000
But that notion has been questioned.

193
0:10:19.66,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Furthermore, Homo naledi, even with its small brain size,

194
0:10:22.787,000 --> 0:10:25,000
has a hand-wrist morphology similar to other species

195
0:10:25.964,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that did make and use stone tools,

196
0:10:28.612,000 --> 0:10:29,000
suggesting it had the capability.

197
0:10:31.314,000 --> 0:10:35,000
With two species coexisting in Africa at 300,000 years,

198
0:10:35.945,000 --> 0:10:37,000
we can no longer assume we know the maker of tools

199
0:10:38.544,000 --> 0:10:41,000
at sites with no associated species.

200
0:10:43.771,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So where does Homo naledi fit in our human evolutionary lineage?

201
0:10:47.217,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Who is it most closely related to?

202
0:10:49.352,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Who did it evolve from?

203
0:10:51.255,000 --> 0:10:53,000
We're still trying to figure all that out.

204
0:10:53.778,000 --> 0:10:55,000
It's ironic, because paleoanthropologists are renowned

205
0:10:56.337,000 --> 0:10:58,000
for having small sample sizes.

206
0:10:58.361,000 --> 0:10:59,000
We now have a large sample size,

207
0:11:00.338,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and more questions than answers.

208
0:11:02.829,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Homo naledi has taught us,

209
0:11:04.62,000 --> 0:11:05,000
has brought us a little bit closer

210
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
to better understanding our evolutionary past.

211
0:11:10.466,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So while Mrs. Ples will always hold a special place in my heart,

212
0:11:14.329,000 --> 0:11:16,000
she now shares that space with several thousand others.

213
0:11:16.969,000 --> 0:11:17,000
(Laughter)

214
0:11:18.023,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Thank you.

215
0:11:19.199,000 --> 0:11:21,000
(Applause)

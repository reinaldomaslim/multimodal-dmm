1
0:00:12.68,000 --> 0:00:15,000
When I was in the sixth grade, I got into a fight at school.

2
0:00:16.88,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It wasn't the first time I'd been in a fight,

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but it was the first time one happened at school.

4
0:00:22.32,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It was with a boy who was about a foot taller than me,

5
0:00:25.88,000 --> 0:00:26,000
who was physically stronger than me

6
0:00:27.84,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and who'd been taunting me for weeks.

7
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:35,000
One day in PE, he stepped on my shoe and refused to apologize.

8
0:00:35.84,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So, filled with anger, I grabbed him and I threw him to the ground.

9
0:00:40.32,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I'd had some previous judo training.

10
0:00:42.08,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:46.92,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Our fight lasted less than two minutes,

12
0:00:49.96,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but it was a perfect reflection of the hurricane

13
0:00:52.24,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that was building inside of me

14
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
as a young survivor of sexual assault

15
0:00:56.24,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and as a girl who was grappling with abandonment

16
0:00:58.64,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and exposure to violence in other spaces in my life.

17
0:01:01.76,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I was fighting him,

18
0:01:03.32,000 --> 0:01:06,000
but I was also fighting the men and boys that had assaulted my body

19
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and the culture that told me I had to be silent about it.

20
0:01:11.24,000 --> 0:01:12,000
A teacher broke up the fight

21
0:01:12.84,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and my principal called me in her office.

22
0:01:15.4,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But she didn't say, "Monique, what's wrong with you?"

23
0:01:19.48,000 --> 0:01:22,000
She gave me a moment to collect my breath

24
0:01:22.64,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and asked, "What happened?"

25
0:01:26.44,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The educators working with me led with empathy.

26
0:01:29.44,000 --> 0:01:3,000
They knew me.

27
0:01:30.68,000 --> 0:01:33,000
They knew I loved to read, they knew I loved to draw,

28
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:35,000
they knew I adored Prince.

29
0:01:37.04,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And they used that information to help me understand

30
0:01:39.88,000 --> 0:01:41,000
why my actions, and those of my classmate, were disruptive

31
0:01:42.72,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to the learning community they were leading.

32
0:01:45.76,000 --> 0:01:47,000
They didn't place me on suspension;

33
0:01:48.32,000 --> 0:01:49,000
they didn't call the police.

34
0:01:50.68,000 --> 0:01:52,000
My fight didn't keep me from going to school the next day.

35
0:01:54.52,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It didn't keep me from graduating; it didn't keep me from teaching.

36
0:02:00.12,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But unfortunately, that's not a story that's shared by many black girls

37
0:02:03.96,000 --> 0:02:04,000
in the US and around the world today.

38
0:02:06.64,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We're living through a crisis in which black girls

39
0:02:09.04,000 --> 0:02:11,000
are being disproportionately pushed away from schools ---

40
0:02:11.8,000 --> 0:02:14,000
not because of an imminent threat they pose to the safety of a school,

41
0:02:15.4,000 --> 0:02:17,000
but because they're often experiencing schools

42
0:02:17.6,000 --> 0:02:19,000
as locations for punishment and marginalization.

43
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
That's something that I hear from black girls around the country.

44
0:02:25.68,000 --> 0:02:26,000
But it's not insurmountable.

45
0:02:27.68,000 --> 0:02:28,000
We can shift this narrative.

46
0:02:30.64,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Let's start with some data.

47
0:02:33.4,000 --> 0:02:36,000
According to a National Black Women's Justice Institute analysis

48
0:02:36.48,000 --> 0:02:37,000
of civil rights data

49
0:02:37.72,000 --> 0:02:39,000
collected by the US Department of Education,

50
0:02:40.72,000 --> 0:02:42,000
black girls are the only group of girls who are overrepresented

51
0:02:43.72,000 --> 0:02:45,000
along the entire continuum of discipline in schools.

52
0:02:47.36,000 --> 0:02:51,000
That doesn't mean that other girls aren't experiencing exclusionary discipline

53
0:02:51.48,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and it doesn't mean that other girls aren't overrepresented

54
0:02:55.12,000 --> 0:02:57,000
at other parts along that continuum.

55
0:02:57.44,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But black girls are the only group of girls

56
0:02:59.48,000 --> 0:03:01,000
who are overrepresented all along the way.

57
0:03:02.96,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Black girls are seven times more likely than their white counterparts

58
0:03:07.12,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to experience one or more out-of-school suspensions

59
0:03:09.84,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and they're nearly three times more likely than their white and Latinx counterparts

60
0:03:13.96,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to be referred to the juvenile court.

61
0:03:16.72,000 --> 0:03:19,000
A recent study by the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality

62
0:03:20.72,000 --> 0:03:23,000
partially explained why this disparity is taking place

63
0:03:23.88,000 --> 0:03:25,000
when they confirmed that black girls experience

64
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
a specific type of age compression,

65
0:03:28.56,000 --> 0:03:31,000
where they're seen as more adult-like than their white peers.

66
0:03:32.64,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Among other things, the study found

67
0:03:34.68,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that people perceive black girls to need less nurturing,

68
0:03:38.76,000 --> 0:03:41,000
less protection, to know more about sex

69
0:03:41.8,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and to be more independent than their white peers.

70
0:03:46.12,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The study also found

71
0:03:47.84,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that the perception disparity begins when girls are as young as five years old.

72
0:03:53.6,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And that this perception and the disparity increases over time

73
0:03:57.84,000 --> 0:04:,000
and peaks when girls are between the ages of 10 and 14.

74
0:04:01.92,000 --> 0:04:02,000
This is not without consequence.

75
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Believing that a girl is older than she is can lead to harsher treatment,

76
0:04:09.48,000 --> 0:04:11,000
immediate censure when she makes a mistake

77
0:04:12.12,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and victim blaming when she's harmed.

78
0:04:15.2,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It can also lead a girl to think that something is wrong with her,

79
0:04:18.52,000 --> 0:04:2,000
rather than the conditions in which she finds herself.

80
0:04:22.88,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Black girls are routinely seen as too loud, too aggressive,

81
0:04:26.8,000 --> 0:04:27,000
too angry, too visible.

82
0:04:29.56,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Qualities that are often measured in relation to nonblack girls

83
0:04:33.04,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and which don't take into consideration what's going on in this girl's life

84
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:39,000
or her cultural norms.

85
0:04:39.04,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And it's not just in the US.

86
0:04:41.04,000 --> 0:04:42,000
In South Africa,

87
0:04:42.64,000 --> 0:04:44,000
black girls at the Pretoria Girls High School

88
0:04:44.8,000 --> 0:04:47,000
were discouraged from attending school with their hair in its natural state,

89
0:04:48.44,000 --> 0:04:49,000
without chemical processing.

90
0:04:50.28,000 --> 0:04:51,000
What did those girls do?

91
0:04:51.92,000 --> 0:04:52,000
They protested.

92
0:04:54.08,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And it was a beautiful thing to see the global community for the most part

93
0:04:57.6,000 --> 0:04:59,000
wrap its arms around girls as they stood in their truths.

94
0:05:01.32,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But there were those who saw them as disruptive,

95
0:05:03.68,000 --> 0:05:05,000
largely because they dared to ask the question,

96
0:05:06.36,000 --> 0:05:09,000
"Where can we be black if we can't be black in Africa?"

97
0:05:09.4,000 --> 0:05:1,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:11.28,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Applause)

99
0:05:13.64,000 --> 0:05:14,000
It's a good question.

100
0:05:16.4,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Around the world,

101
0:05:18.6,000 --> 0:05:2,000
black girls are grappling with this question.

102
0:05:21.52,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And around the world,

103
0:05:23.36,000 --> 0:05:26,000
black girls are struggling to be seen, working to be free

104
0:05:26.88,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and fighting to be included

105
0:05:28.52,000 --> 0:05:31,000
in the landscape of promise that a safe space to learn provides.

106
0:05:32.8,000 --> 0:05:35,000
In the US, little girls, just past their toddler years,

107
0:05:36.08,000 --> 0:05:38,000
are being arrested in classrooms for having a tantrum.

108
0:05:39.52,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Middle school girls are being turned away from school

109
0:05:42.52,000 --> 0:05:44,000
because of the way they wear their hair naturally

110
0:05:45.32,000 --> 0:05:47,000
or because of the way the clothes fit their bodies.

111
0:05:48.52,000 --> 0:05:5,000
High school girls are experiencing violence

112
0:05:50.6,000 --> 0:05:52,000
at the hands of police officers in schools.

113
0:05:53.76,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Where can black girls be black without reprimand or punishment?

114
0:06:00.12,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And it's not just these incidents.

115
0:06:02.76,000 --> 0:06:04,000
In my work as a researcher and educator,

116
0:06:04.84,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I've had an opportunity to work with girls like Stacy,

117
0:06:08.24,000 --> 0:06:1,000
a girl who I profile in my book "Pushout,"

118
0:06:10.8,000 --> 0:06:12,000
who struggles with her participation in violence.

119
0:06:15.36,000 --> 0:06:19,000
She bypasses the neuroscientific and structural analyses

120
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that science has to offer

121
0:06:21.6,000 --> 0:06:24,000
about how her adverse childhood experiences inform

122
0:06:25.04,000 --> 0:06:27,000
why she's participating in violence

123
0:06:27.12,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and goes straight to describing herself as a "problem child,"

124
0:06:30.4,000 --> 0:06:32,000
largely because that's the language that educators were using

125
0:06:33.32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
as they routinely suspended her.

126
0:06:37.36,000 --> 0:06:38,000
But here's the thing.

127
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Disconnection and the internalization of harm grow stronger in isolation.

128
0:06:44.24,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So when girls get in trouble, we shouldn't be pushing them away,

129
0:06:47.32,000 --> 0:06:48,000
we should be bringing them in closer.

130
0:06:50.52,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Education is a critical protective factor

131
0:06:52.76,000 --> 0:06:54,000
against contact with the criminal legal system.

132
0:06:56.4,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So we should be building out policies and practices

133
0:06:58.84,000 --> 0:07:,000
that keep girls connected to their learning,

134
0:07:00.96,000 --> 0:07:01,000
rather than pushing them away from it.

135
0:07:02.84,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It's one of the reasons I like to say that education is freedom work.

136
0:07:08.68,000 --> 0:07:1,000
When girls feel safe, they can learn.

137
0:07:12.28,000 --> 0:07:14,000
When they don't feel safe, they fight,

138
0:07:14.92,000 --> 0:07:19,000
they protest, they argue, they flee, they freeze.

139
0:07:21.12,000 --> 0:07:24,000
The human brain is wired to protect us when we feel a threat.

140
0:07:24.36,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And so long as school feels like a threat,

141
0:07:26.44,000 --> 0:07:28,000
or part of the tapestry of harm in a girl's life,

142
0:07:29.2,000 --> 0:07:3,000
she'll be inclined to resist.

143
0:07:31.92,000 --> 0:07:34,000
But when schools become locations for healing,

144
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
they can also become locations for learning.

145
0:07:38.72,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So what does this mean for a school to become a location for healing?

146
0:07:42.48,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Well, for one thing, it means that we have to immediately discontinue

147
0:07:45.76,000 --> 0:07:49,000
the policies and practices that target black girls for their hairstyles or dress.

148
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Applause)

149
0:07:56.12,000 --> 0:08:,000
Let's focus on how and what a girl learns

150
0:08:00.2,000 --> 0:08:03,000
rather than policing her body in ways that facilitate rape culture

151
0:08:04.08,000 --> 0:08:07,000
or punish children for the conditions in which they were born.

152
0:08:08.96,000 --> 0:08:11,000
This is where parents and the community of concerned adults can enter this work.

153
0:08:13.68,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Start a conversation with the school

154
0:08:15.52,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and encourage them to address their dress code

155
0:08:18.24,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and other conduct-related policies as a collaborative project,

156
0:08:21.4,000 --> 0:08:22,000
with parents and students,

157
0:08:23.36,000 --> 0:08:26,000
so as to intentionally avoid bias and discrimination.

158
0:08:27.48,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Keep in mind, though,

159
0:08:28.72,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that some of the practices that harm black girls most are unwritten.

160
0:08:31.96,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So we have to continue to do the deep, internal work to address the biases

161
0:08:36.28,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that inform how, when and whether we see black girls for who they actually are,

162
0:08:40.96,000 --> 0:08:41,000
or what we've been told they are.

163
0:08:44.159,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Volunteer at a school

164
0:08:46.28,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and establish culturally competent and gender responsive discussion groups

165
0:08:51.12,000 --> 0:08:53,000
with black girls, Latinas, indigenous girls

166
0:08:54.12,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and other students who experience marginalization in schools

167
0:08:57.6,000 --> 0:08:58,000
to give them a safe space

168
0:08:58.88,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to process their identities and experiences in schools.

169
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And if schools are to become locations for healing,

170
0:09:05.76,000 --> 0:09:07,000
we have to remove police officers

171
0:09:07.96,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and increase the number of counselors in schools.

172
0:09:10.56,000 --> 0:09:16,000
(Applause)

173
0:09:18.52,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Education is freedom work.

174
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And whatever our point of entry is, we all have to be freedom fighters.

175
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
The good news is that there are schools

176
0:09:29.08,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that are actively working to establish themselves

177
0:09:31.68,000 --> 0:09:34,000
as locations for girls to see themselves as sacred and loved.

178
0:09:36.36,000 --> 0:09:41,000
The Columbus City Prep School for Girls in Columbus, Ohio, is an example of this.

179
0:09:41.52,000 --> 0:09:43,000
They became an example the moment their principal declared

180
0:09:44.28,000 --> 0:09:47,000
that they were no longer going to punish girls for having "a bad attitude."

181
0:09:49.32,000 --> 0:09:51,000
In addition to building --

182
0:09:51.8,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Essentially, what they did is they built out a robust continuum

183
0:09:54.8,000 --> 0:09:57,000
of alternatives to suspension, expulsion and arrest.

184
0:09:58.28,000 --> 0:10:02,000
In addition to establishing a restorative justice program,

185
0:10:02.36,000 --> 0:10:04,000
they improved their student and teacher relationships

186
0:10:04.88,000 --> 0:10:06,000
by ensuring that every girl has at least one adult on campus

187
0:10:07.84,000 --> 0:10:09,000
that she can go to when she's in a moment of crisis.

188
0:10:10.76,000 --> 0:10:13,000
They built out spaces along the corridors of the school and in classrooms

189
0:10:14.24,000 --> 0:10:16,000
for girls to regroup, if they need a minute to do so.

190
0:10:17.4,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And they established an advisory program that provides girls with an opportunity

191
0:10:21.24,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to start every single day with the promotion of self-worth,

192
0:10:25.48,000 --> 0:10:27,000
communication skills and goal setting.

193
0:10:28.44,000 --> 0:10:29,000
At this school,

194
0:10:29.72,000 --> 0:10:32,000
they're trying to respond to a girl's adverse childhood experiences

195
0:10:33.36,000 --> 0:10:34,000
rather than ignore them.

196
0:10:34.88,000 --> 0:10:36,000
They bring them in closer; they don't push them away.

197
0:10:38.52,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And as a result, their truancy and suspension rates have improved,

198
0:10:41.92,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and girls are arriving at school increasingly ready to learn

199
0:10:44.96,000 --> 0:10:46,000
because they know the teachers there care about them.

200
0:10:47.72,000 --> 0:10:48,000
That matters.

201
0:10:49.96,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Schools that integrate the arts and sports into their curriculum

202
0:10:53.32,000 --> 0:10:55,000
or that are building out tranformative programming,

203
0:10:56.12,000 --> 0:10:59,000
such as restorative justice, mindfulness and meditation,

204
0:10:59.88,000 --> 0:11:03,000
are providing an opportunity for girls to repair their relationships with others,

205
0:11:04.64,000 --> 0:11:05,000
but also with themselves.

206
0:11:07.36,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Responding to the lived, complex and historical trauma

207
0:11:10.92,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that our students face

208
0:11:12.44,000 --> 0:11:16,000
requires all of us who believe in the promise of children and adolescents

209
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:2,000
to build relationships, learning materials,

210
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
human and financial resources and other tools

211
0:11:23.76,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that provide children with an opportunity to heal, so that they can learn.

212
0:11:30.36,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Our schools should be places where we respond to our most vulnerable girls

213
0:11:34.92,000 --> 0:11:37,000
as essential to the creation of a positive school culture.

214
0:11:40.08,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Our ability to see her promise should be at its sharpest

215
0:11:43.72,000 --> 0:11:45,000
when she's in the throws of poverty and addiction;

216
0:11:46.6,000 --> 0:11:48,000
when she's reeling from having been sex-trafficked

217
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:51,000
or survived other forms of violence;

218
0:11:51.6,000 --> 0:11:53,000
when she's at her loudest,

219
0:11:54.28,000 --> 0:11:55,000
or her quietest.

220
0:11:57.28,000 --> 0:11:59,000
We should be able to support her intellectual

221
0:11:59.8,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and social-emotional well-being

222
0:12:01.84,000 --> 0:12:04,000
whether her shorts reach her knees or stop mid-thigh or higher.

223
0:12:08.68,000 --> 0:12:1,000
It might seem like a tall order in a world

224
0:12:11.08,000 --> 0:12:13,000
so deeply entrenched in the politics of fear

225
0:12:13.56,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to radically imagine schools as locations where girls can heal and thrive,

226
0:12:18.36,000 --> 0:12:2,000
but we have to be bold enough to set this as our intention.

227
0:12:22.4,000 --> 0:12:25,000
If we commit to this notion of education as freedom work,

228
0:12:26.32,000 --> 0:12:28,000
we can shift educational conditions

229
0:12:28.64,000 --> 0:12:31,000
so that no girl, even the most vulnerable among us,

230
0:12:32.32,000 --> 0:12:33,000
will get pushed out of school.

231
0:12:34.04,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And that's a win for all of us.

232
0:12:36.64,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Thank you.

233
0:12:37.92,000 --> 0:12:42,000
(Applause)

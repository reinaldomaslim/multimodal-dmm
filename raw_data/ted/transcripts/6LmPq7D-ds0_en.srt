1
0:00:12.727,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Thank you very much. Good evening.

2
0:00:14.382,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Some of you may have noticed that my last name is Nutt.

3
0:00:18.336,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And if you did, you are forgiven for wondering

4
0:00:21.163,000 --> 0:00:23,000
how a Nutt managed to end up in a war zone.

5
0:00:24.103,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I actually was offered, right out of medical school, and accepted

6
0:00:28.468,000 --> 0:00:31,000
a volunteer contract to work with UNICEF in war-torn Somalia,

7
0:00:32.329,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that was worth one dollar.

8
0:00:34.832,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And, you see, I had to be paid this dollar

9
0:00:37.267,000 --> 0:00:4,000
in the event that the UN needed to issue an evacuation order,

10
0:00:40.426,000 --> 0:00:42,000
so that I would be covered.

11
0:00:42.52,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I was, after all, heading into one of the world's most dangerous places.

12
0:00:47.34,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And by now, some of you may be asking yourselves,

13
0:00:50.499,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and I just want to reassure you,

14
0:00:52.055,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that I did get half the money up front.

15
0:00:54.378,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:56.717,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But you see, this is how, with 50 cents in my pocket,

17
0:00:59.593,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I ended up in Baidoa, Somalia.

18
0:01:02.615,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Journalists called it the "city of death."

19
0:01:05.299,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And they called it the city of death

20
0:01:07.147,000 --> 0:01:1,000
because 300,000 people had lost their lives there --

21
0:01:10.765,000 --> 0:01:13,000
300,000 people,

22
0:01:14.387,000 --> 0:01:18,000
mostly as a result of war-related famine and disease.

23
0:01:19.487,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I was part of a team that was tasked with trying to figure out

24
0:01:23.458,000 --> 0:01:25,000
how best to respond to this humanitarian catastrophe.

25
0:01:26.839,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It was right on the heels of the Rwandan genocide,

26
0:01:29.578,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and aid money to the region was drying up.

27
0:01:32.269,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Many aid organizations, unfortunately,

28
0:01:34.335,000 --> 0:01:36,000
had been forced to close their doors.

29
0:01:36.935,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And so the question that I was asked to specifically help answer,

30
0:01:40.669,000 --> 0:01:45,000
which is one that aid workers ask themselves in war zones the world over,

31
0:01:47.202,000 --> 0:01:49,000
is: What the hell do we do now?

32
0:01:50.131,000 --> 0:01:53,000
You know, the security environment in Somalia at that moment in time --

33
0:01:53.559,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and nothing has really changed too much --

34
0:01:55.614,000 --> 0:01:59,000
can best be described as "Mad Max" by way of "A Clockwork Orange."

35
0:02:01.477,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And I remember very distinctly a couple of days after my arrival,

36
0:02:06.632,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I went up to a feeding clinic.

37
0:02:09.967,000 --> 0:02:11,000
There were dozens of women who were standing in line,

38
0:02:12.529,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and they were clutching their infants very close.

39
0:02:16.309,000 --> 0:02:18,000
About 20 minutes into this conversation I was having

40
0:02:19.078,000 --> 0:02:21,000
with this one young woman,

41
0:02:21.126,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I leaned forward

42
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and tried to put my finger in the palm of her baby's hand.

43
0:02:28.225,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And when I did this,

44
0:02:29.56,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I discovered that her baby was already in rigor.

45
0:02:34.249,000 --> 0:02:35,000
She was stiff,

46
0:02:36.709,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and her little, lifeless hand was curled into itself.

47
0:02:40.986,000 --> 0:02:43,000
She had died hours before

48
0:02:44.759,000 --> 0:02:46,000
of malnutrition and dehydration.

49
0:02:48.242,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I later learned that as her baby was dying,

50
0:02:51.164,000 --> 0:02:55,000
this young woman had been held for two days

51
0:02:55.51,000 --> 0:02:59,000
by some teenage boys who were armed with Kalashnikov rifles,

52
0:03:00.27,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and they were trying to shake her down for more money,

53
0:03:02.824,000 --> 0:03:04,000
money she very clearly did not have.

54
0:03:05.807,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And this is a scene that I have confronted

55
0:03:09.172,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in war zones the world over;

56
0:03:12.435,000 --> 0:03:17,000
places where kids, some as young as eight -- they are this big --

57
0:03:18.345,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and those kids, they have never been to school.

58
0:03:21.049,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But they have fought and they have killed with automatic rifles.

59
0:03:28.589,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Is this just the way the world is?

60
0:03:32.451,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Some will you tell you that war is unavoidably human.

61
0:03:37.234,000 --> 0:03:4,000
After all, it is as old as existence itself.

62
0:03:41.419,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We say never again, and yet it happens again and again and again.

63
0:03:49.232,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But I will tell you that I have seen the absolute worst

64
0:03:55.671,000 --> 0:03:58,000
of what we as human beings are capable of doing to one another,

65
0:04:00.222,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and yet I still believe a different outcome is possible.

66
0:04:05.659,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Do you want to know why?

67
0:04:07.536,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Because over 20 years of doing this work,

68
0:04:09.878,000 --> 0:04:11,000
going in and out of war zones around the world,

69
0:04:12.613,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I have come to understand

70
0:04:14.78,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that there are aspects of this problem

71
0:04:16.724,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that we, all of us, as people occupying this shared space,

72
0:04:21.421,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that we can change --

73
0:04:23.628,000 --> 0:04:26,000
not through force or coercion or invasion,

74
0:04:27.586,000 --> 0:04:3,000
but by simply looking at all of the options available to us

75
0:04:31.94,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and choosing the ones that favor peace at the expense of war,

76
0:04:37.722,000 --> 0:04:41,000
instead of war at the expense of peace.

77
0:04:43.158,000 --> 0:04:44,000
How so?

78
0:04:44.444,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Well, I want you to consider this:

79
0:04:46.207,000 --> 0:04:51,000
there are at least 800 million small arms and light weapons

80
0:04:51.688,000 --> 0:04:53,000
in circulation in the world today.

81
0:04:54.788,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The vast majority of civilians, like that young baby,

82
0:04:58.301,000 --> 0:05:,000
who are dying in war zones around the world,

83
0:05:00.714,000 --> 0:05:02,000
are dying at the hands of various armed groups

84
0:05:03.713,000 --> 0:05:09,000
who rely on a near-infinite supply of cheap, easy and efficient weapons

85
0:05:10.063,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to rape, threaten, intimidate and brutalize those civilians

86
0:05:14.747,000 --> 0:05:15,000
at every turn.

87
0:05:16.937,000 --> 0:05:17,000
How cheap?

88
0:05:18.112,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Well, in some parts of the world,

89
0:05:19.752,000 --> 0:05:23,000
you can buy an AK-47 for as little as 10 dollars.

90
0:05:24.174,000 --> 0:05:26,000
In many places in which I have worked,

91
0:05:27.621,000 --> 0:05:31,000
it is easier to get access to an automatic rifle

92
0:05:32.142,000 --> 0:05:36,000
than it is to get access to clean drinking water.

93
0:05:37.04,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And so now the important part:

94
0:05:39.699,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Can anything be done about this?

95
0:05:43.922,000 --> 0:05:44,000
To answer that question,

96
0:05:45.826,000 --> 0:05:47,000
let's take a look at this map of the world.

97
0:05:48.246,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And now, let's add in all of the countries that are currently at war,

98
0:05:53.266,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and the number of people who have either died

99
0:05:55.624,000 --> 0:05:57,000
or have been displaced as a result of that violence.

100
0:05:58.116,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It is a staggering number --

101
0:05:59.536,000 --> 0:06:01,000
more than 40 million people.

102
0:06:02.764,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But you will also notice something else about this map.

103
0:06:05.455,000 --> 0:06:07,000
You will notice that most of those countries

104
0:06:07.599,000 --> 0:06:08,000
are in the Global South.

105
0:06:09.453,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Now, let's look at the countries

106
0:06:11.767,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that are the world's top 20 exporters of small arms in the world.

107
0:06:17.559,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And what do we notice?

108
0:06:19.331,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Well, you see them in green.

109
0:06:20.818,000 --> 0:06:23,000
You will notice that those are mostly countries in the Global North,

110
0:06:24.732,000 --> 0:06:25,000
primarily Western countries.

111
0:06:26.454,000 --> 0:06:27,000
What does this tell us?

112
0:06:27.694,000 --> 0:06:3,000
This tells us that most of the people who are dying in war

113
0:06:31.209,000 --> 0:06:32,000
are living in poor countries,

114
0:06:33.136,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and yet most of the people who are profiting from war

115
0:06:36.609,000 --> 0:06:4,000
are living in rich countries -- people like you and me.

116
0:06:41.804,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And then what if we go beyond small arms for a second.

117
0:06:44.63,000 --> 0:06:47,000
What if we look at all weapons in circulation in the world?

118
0:06:47.878,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Who does the biggest business?

119
0:06:49.686,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Well, roughly 80 percent of those weapons

120
0:06:52.185,000 --> 0:06:55,000
come from none other than the five permanent members

121
0:06:55.751,000 --> 0:06:56,000
of the United Nations Security Council,

122
0:06:57.666,000 --> 0:06:58,000
plus Germany.

123
0:06:59.769,000 --> 0:07:,000
It's shocking, isn't it?

124
0:07:01.515,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Now, some of you might be saying at this moment in time,

125
0:07:04.215,000 --> 0:07:07,000
"Oh yeah, but OK, hang on a second there ... Nutt."

126
0:07:07.49,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Laughter)

127
0:07:10.267,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Grade school was spectacular for me.

128
0:07:12.104,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It was, really, a wonderful experience.

129
0:07:14.072,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Laughter)

130
0:07:17.42,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But you might be saying to yourselves,

131
0:07:19.286,000 --> 0:07:22,000
You know, all of these weapons in war zones -- they're not a cause,

132
0:07:22.658,000 --> 0:07:24,000
but an effect of the violence that plagues them

133
0:07:25.104,000 --> 0:07:26,000
each and every single day.

134
0:07:26.612,000 --> 0:07:28,000
You know, places like Iraq and Afghanistan,

135
0:07:28.819,000 --> 0:07:31,000
where they need these weapons to be able to maintain law and order,

136
0:07:32.257,000 --> 0:07:35,000
promote peace and security, to combat terror groups --

137
0:07:35.902,000 --> 0:07:37,000
surely this is a good thing.

138
0:07:38.773,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Let's take a look at that assumption for just one moment,

139
0:07:41.485,000 --> 0:07:44,000
because you see there has been a boom in the small-arms trade

140
0:07:45.295,000 --> 0:07:46,000
since the start of the War on Terror.

141
0:07:47.103,000 --> 0:07:5,000
In fact, it is a business that has grown threefold

142
0:07:50.325,000 --> 0:07:51,000
over the past 15 years.

143
0:07:52.688,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And now let's compare that to the number of people

144
0:07:56.269,000 --> 0:07:59,000
who have directly died in armed conflict around the world

145
0:08:00.119,000 --> 0:08:01,000
in that same period.

146
0:08:01.627,000 --> 0:08:02,000
What do you notice?

147
0:08:03.096,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Well, you notice that, in fact, that also goes up

148
0:08:05.477,000 --> 0:08:06,000
roughly three- to fourfold.

149
0:08:07.112,000 --> 0:08:1,000
They basically go up and end at the same point.

150
0:08:11.31,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Now, we can have a circular argument here

151
0:08:14.104,000 --> 0:08:18,000
about whether this increase in fatalities is a response

152
0:08:18.2,000 --> 0:08:21,000
to the increase of small arms, or the other way around.

153
0:08:22.133,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But here's what we should really take away from this.

154
0:08:24.653,000 --> 0:08:25,000
What we should take away from this

155
0:08:26.337,000 --> 0:08:3,000
is that this is a relationship worth scrutinizing,

156
0:08:31.447,000 --> 0:08:35,000
especially when you consider that small arms that were shipped to Iraq

157
0:08:36.337,000 --> 0:08:37,000
for use by the Iraqi Army,

158
0:08:38.155,000 --> 0:08:41,000
or to Syria for so-called moderate opposition fighters,

159
0:08:41.426,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that those arms, many of them, are now in the hands of ISIS;

160
0:08:46.096,000 --> 0:08:48,000
or when you consider that arms that were shipped to Libya

161
0:08:48.86,000 --> 0:08:5,000
are now actively drifting across the Sahel,

162
0:08:51.597,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and ending up with groups like Boko Haram and al Qaeda

163
0:08:56.364,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and other militant groups.

164
0:08:59.95,000 --> 0:09:,000
And therein lies the problem.

165
0:09:02.466,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Because, you see,

166
0:09:03.642,000 --> 0:09:08,000
small arms anywhere are a menace everywhere,

167
0:09:09.831,000 --> 0:09:13,000
because their first stop is rarely their last.

168
0:09:14.904,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Spending on war per person per year

169
0:09:17.344,000 --> 0:09:21,000
now amounts to about 249 dollars --

170
0:09:21.413,000 --> 0:09:23,000
249 dollars per person,

171
0:09:23.838,000 --> 0:09:27,000
which is roughly 12 times what we spend on foreign aid,

172
0:09:28.801,000 --> 0:09:31,000
money that is used to educate and vaccinate children

173
0:09:32.262,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and combat malnutrition in the Global South.

174
0:09:35.814,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But we can shift that balance.

175
0:09:39.604,000 --> 0:09:4,000
How do we do this?

176
0:09:40.779,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Well, it is essentially a problem of both supply and demand,

177
0:09:43.645,000 --> 0:09:44,000
so we can tackle it from both sides.

178
0:09:45.993,000 --> 0:09:46,000
On the supply side,

179
0:09:47.687,000 --> 0:09:5,000
we can push our governments

180
0:09:50.885,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to adopt international arms transparency mechanisms

181
0:09:53.972,000 --> 0:09:54,000
like the Arms Trade Treaty,

182
0:09:55.797,000 --> 0:09:58,000
which makes it so that rich countries have to be more accountable

183
0:09:59.588,000 --> 0:10:,000
for where their arms are going

184
0:10:01.287,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and what their arms might be used for.

185
0:10:03.71,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Here in the United States,

186
0:10:04.999,000 --> 0:10:08,000
the largest arms-exporting country in the world by far,

187
0:10:09.64,000 --> 0:10:12,000
President Obama has rightly signed the Arms Trade Treaty,

188
0:10:13.589,000 --> 0:10:15,000
but none of it takes effect, it isn't binding,

189
0:10:16.174,000 --> 0:10:19,000
until it is approved and ratified by the Senate.

190
0:10:20.865,000 --> 0:10:22,000
This is where we need to make our voices heard.

191
0:10:23.843,000 --> 0:10:26,000
You know, the curbing of small arms --

192
0:10:27.581,000 --> 0:10:29,000
it's not going to solve the problem of war.

193
0:10:30.407,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Increased control mechanisms won't solve that problem.

194
0:10:33.713,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But it's an important step in the right direction.

195
0:10:36.984,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And it's up to all of us who live in those rich countries

196
0:10:39.881,000 --> 0:10:4,000
to make change here.

197
0:10:41.994,000 --> 0:10:44,000
What about on the demand side?

198
0:10:45.227,000 --> 0:10:47,000
You know, there are generations around the world

199
0:10:48.004,000 --> 0:10:5,000
who are being lost to war.

200
0:10:51.202,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It is possible to disrupt that cycle of violence

201
0:10:54.217,000 --> 0:10:57,000
with investments in education, in strengthening the rule of law

202
0:10:58.234,000 --> 0:11:,000
and in economic development, especially for women.

203
0:11:00.639,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I have personally seen

204
0:11:02.291,000 --> 0:11:05,000
just how incredibly powerful those kinds of efforts can be

205
0:11:05.356,000 --> 0:11:06,000
around the world.

206
0:11:07.458,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But here's the thing:

207
0:11:08.858,000 --> 0:11:09,000
they take time,

208
0:11:10.29,000 --> 0:11:14,000
which means for you as individuals, if you want to give,

209
0:11:14.353,000 --> 0:11:15,000
please, by all means do it.

210
0:11:16.084,000 --> 0:11:19,000
But know that how you give is just as important

211
0:11:19.671,000 --> 0:11:21,000
as how much you give.

212
0:11:22.147,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Regular contributions like monthly contributions

213
0:11:24.616,000 --> 0:11:27,000
are a far more effective way of giving,

214
0:11:27.928,000 --> 0:11:29,000
because they allow humanitarian organizations

215
0:11:30.665,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to properly plan and be invested over the long term,

216
0:11:35.014,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and to be present in the lives of families who have been affected by war,

217
0:11:40.663,000 --> 0:11:44,000
wars that many of us, frankly, all too quickly forget.

218
0:11:45.939,000 --> 0:11:5,000
When I first got on that plane for Somalia as a young doctor,

219
0:11:52.942,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I had no idea what it meant to live with war.

220
0:11:57.519,000 --> 0:11:59,000
But I can tell you that I know what it means now.

221
0:12:00.636,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And I know what it means

222
0:12:03.529,000 --> 0:12:07,000
to lie in bed in the pitch-black night

223
0:12:08.684,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and listen to that haunting "pop-pop-pop-pop-pop!"

224
0:12:13.295,000 --> 0:12:14,000
of automatic gunfire,

225
0:12:16.002,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and wonder with absolute dread

226
0:12:19.298,000 --> 0:12:22,000
how many minutes I have left until it will be right on top of me.

227
0:12:23.556,000 --> 0:12:28,000
I can tell you that it is a terrifying and agonizing fear,

228
0:12:28.617,000 --> 0:12:32,000
one that millions of people around the world are forced to confront

229
0:12:32.998,000 --> 0:12:34,000
each and every single day,

230
0:12:35.188,000 --> 0:12:36,000
especially children.

231
0:12:37.417,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Over the years of doing this work,

232
0:12:40.181,000 --> 0:12:45,000
unfortunately, war has killed far too many people close to me.

233
0:12:46.277,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And on at least a couple of occasions,

234
0:12:49.277,000 --> 0:12:51,000
war has very nearly killed me as well.

235
0:12:53.309,000 --> 0:12:57,000
But I firmly believe,

236
0:12:58.207,000 --> 0:13:,000
which is why I get up and do what I do every single day,

237
0:13:01.786,000 --> 0:13:03,000
that we can make different choices here.

238
0:13:05.284,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Because you see, war is ours,

239
0:13:08.127,000 --> 0:13:09,000
as human beings.

240
0:13:09.73,000 --> 0:13:12,000
We buy it, sell it, spread it and wage it.

241
0:13:13.96,000 --> 0:13:16,000
We are therefore not powerless to solve it.

242
0:13:18.569,000 --> 0:13:19,000
On the contrary,

243
0:13:20.264,000 --> 0:13:22,000
we are the only ones who can.

244
0:13:23.731,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Thank you very much, and I want to wish you the greatest success.

245
0:13:26.865,000 --> 0:13:32,000
(Applause)

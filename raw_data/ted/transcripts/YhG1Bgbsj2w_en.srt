1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Namaste. Good morning.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I'm very happy to be here in India.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And I've been thinking a lot about what I have learned

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
over these last particularly 11 years

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
with V-Day and "The Vagina Monologues,"

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
traveling the world,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to stop violence against women.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
What I want to talk about today

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
is this particular cell,

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
or grouping of cells, that is in each and every one of us.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And I want to call it the girl cell.

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And it's in men as well as in women.

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
is central to the evolution of our species

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and the continuation of the human race.

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
And I want you imagine that at some point in history

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
understood that the suppression of this particular cell,

20
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the oppression of these cells,

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the reinterpretation of these cells,

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
the undermining of these cells,

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and the crushing, eradicating, destroying,

25
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
reducing these cells,

26
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
basically began the process of killing off the girl cell,

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
which was, by the way, patriarchy.

28
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I want you to imagine that the girl is a chip

29
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness.

30
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And it is essential to balance, to wisdom

31
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and to actually the future of all of us.

32
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And then I want you to imagine that this girl cell

33
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
is compassion,

34
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and it's empathy, and it's passion itself,

35
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and it's vulnerability,

36
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and it's openness, and it's intensity,

37
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and it's association, and it's relationship,

38
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and it is intuitive.

39
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And then let's think how compassion informs wisdom,

40
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and that vulnerability is our greatest strength,

41
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and that emotions have inherent logic,

42
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
which lead to radical, appropriate, saving action.

43
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And then let's remember that we've been taught

44
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
the exact opposite by the powers that be,

45
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that compassion clouds your thinking,

46
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that it gets in the way,

47
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that vulnerability is weakness,

48
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that emotions are not to be trusted,

49
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and you're not supposed to take things personally,

50
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
which is one of my favorites.

51
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I think the whole world has essentially

52
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
been brought up not to be a girl.

53
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
How do we bring up boys? What does it mean to be a boy?

54
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
To be a boy really means not to be a girl.

55
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
To be a man means not to be a girl.

56
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
To be a woman means not to be a girl.

57
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
To be strong means not to be a girl.

58
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
To be a leader means not to be a girl.

59
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I actually think that

60
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
being a girl is so powerful

61
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that we've had to train everyone not to be that.

62
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And I'd also like to say that the irony

64
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
of course, is that denying girl,

65
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
suppressing girl, suppressing emotion,

66
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
refusing feeling has lead thus here.

67
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Where we have now come to live in a world where

68
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
the most extreme forms of violence,

69
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
the most horrific poverty,

70
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
genocide, mass rapes,

71
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
the destruction of the Earth, is completely out of control.

72
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And because we have suppressed our girl cells

73
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and suppressed our girl-ship,

74
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
we do not feel what is going on.

75
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So, we are not being charged with

76
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the adequate response to what is happening.

77
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I want to talk a little bit about

78
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the Democratic Republic of Congo.

79
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
For me, it was the turning point of my life.

80
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I have spent a lot of time there in the last three years.

81
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I feel up to that point I had seen a lot in the world,

82
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
a lot of violence.

83
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last 12 years.

84
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But the Democratic Republic of Congo

85
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
really was the turning point in my soul.

86
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I went and I spent time

87
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
in a place called Bukavu

88
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in a hospital called the Panzi Hospital,

89
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person I've ever met.

90
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege.

91
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
In the Congo, for those of you who don't know,

92
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
there has been a war raging for the last 12 years,

93
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
a war that has killed nearly six million people.

94
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It is estimated that somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 women

95
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
have been raped there.

96
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
When I spent my first weeks at Panzi hospital

97
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I sat with women

98
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories.

99
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Their stories were so horrific,

100
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and so mind-blowing and so on the other side of human existence,

101
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that to be perfectly honest with you, I was shattered.

102
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And I will tell you that what happened

103
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
is through that shattering,

104
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
listening to the stories of eight-year-old girls who had their insides eviscerated,

105
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them

106
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
so they had holes, literally, inside them

107
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
where their pee and poop came out of them.

108
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Listening to the story of 80-year-old women

109
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
who were tied to chains and circled,

110
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically,

111
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
all in the name of economic exploitation

112
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to steal the minerals so the West can have it and profit from them.

113
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
My mind was so shattered.

114
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But what happened for me is that that shattering

115
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
actually emboldened me

116
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
in a way I have never been emboldened.

117
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
That shattering, that opening of my girl cell,

118
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart

119
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
allowed me to become more courageous, and braver,

120
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and actually more clever

121
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
than I had been in the past in my life.

122
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I want to say that I think the powers that be

123
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
know that empire-building

124
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
is actually -- that feelings get in the way of empire-building.

125
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the Earth,

126
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and excavating the Earth, and destroying things.

127
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I remember, for example, when my father,

128
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
who was very, very violent, used to beat me.

129
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And he would actually say, while he was beating me,

130
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
"Don't you cry. Don't you dare cry."

131
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him.

132
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And even in the moment he didn't want to be reminded

133
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
of what he was doing.

134
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell.

135
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And I want to say we've annihilated it in men as well as in women.

136
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And I think in some ways

137
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
we've been much harsher to men

138
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
in the annihilation of their girl cell.

139
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Applause)

140
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I see how boys have been brought up, and I see this across the planet:

141
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to be tough, to be hardened,

142
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
to distance themselves from their tenderness, to not cry.

143
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I actually realized once in Kosovo,

144
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
when I watched a man break down,

145
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that bullets are actually hardened tears,

146
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that when we don't allow men to have their girl self

147
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and have their vulnerability, and have their compassion,

148
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and have their hearts, that they become hardened and hurtful

149
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and violent.

150
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And I think we have taught men to be secure

151
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
when they are insecure,

152
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to pretend they know things when they don't know things,

153
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
or why would we be where we are?

154
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
To pretend they're not a mess when they are a mess.

155
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And I will tell you a very funny story.

156
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
On my way here on the airplane, I was walking up and down the aisle of the plane.

157
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And all these men, literally at least 10 men,

158
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
were in their little seats watching chick flicks.

159
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And they were all alone, and I thought, "This is the secret life of men."

160
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Laughter)

161
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I've traveled, as I said,

162
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to many, many countries,

163
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and I've seen, if we do what we do to the girl inside us

164
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
then obviously it's horrific to think

165
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
what we do to girls in the world.

166
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And we heard from Sunitha yesterday,

167
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and Kavita about what we do to girls.

168
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But I just want to say that

169
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns,

170
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
who are literally being treated like ashtrays.

171
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I've seen girls be treated like garbage cans.

172
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers

173
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and brothers and fathers and uncles.

174
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
I've seen girls starving themselves to death in America

175
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves.

176
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I've seen that we cut girls and we control them

177
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and we keep them illiterate,

178
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
or we make them feel bad about being too smart.

179
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
We silence them. We make them feel guilty

180
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
for being smart. We get them to behave,

181
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
to tone it down, not to be too intense.

182
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
We sell them, we kill them as embryos,

183
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
we enslave them, we rape them.

184
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
We are so accustomed to robbing girls

185
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
of the subject of being the subjects of their lives

186
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
that we have now actually objectified them

187
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and turned them into commodities.

188
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
The selling of girls is rampant across the planet.

189
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And in many places they are worth less than goats and cows.

190
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
But I also want to talk about the fact that

191
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
if one in eight people on the planet

192
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
are girls between the ages of 10 to 24,

193
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
they are they key, really, in the developing world,

194
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
as well as in the whole world, to the future of humanity.

195
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages

196
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that keep them where society wants them to be,

197
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
including lack of access to healthcare,

198
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
education, healthy foods,

199
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
labor force participation.

200
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
The burden of all the household tasks

201
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
usually falls on girls and younger siblings,

202
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers.

203
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
The state of girls, the condition of girls,

204
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
will, in my belief -- and that's the girl inside us

205
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and the girl in the world -- determine whether

206
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
the species survives.

207
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And what I want to suggest is that,

208
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
having talked to girls, because I just finished a new book called

209
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
"I Am an Emotional Creature: The Secret Life of Girls Around the World,"

210
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I've been talking to girls for five years,

211
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and one of the things that I've seen is true everywhere

212
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
is that the verb that's been enforced on girl

213
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
is the verb "to please."

214
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Girls are trained to please.

215
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I want to change the verb.

216
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I want us all to change the verb.

217
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I want the verb to be "educate,"

218
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
or "activate," or "engage,"

219
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
or "confront," or "defy," or "create."

220
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
If we teach girls to change the verb

221
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
we will actually enforce the girl inside us

222
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and the girl inside them.

223
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And I have to now share a few stories

224
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
of girls I've seen across the planet

225
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
who have engaged their girl,

226
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
who have taken on their girl in spite of

227
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
all the circumstances around them.

228
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I know a 14-year-old girl in the Netherlands,

229
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
for example, who is demanding that she take a boat

230
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and go around the entire world by herself.

231
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
There is a teenage girl who just recently

232
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
went out and knew that she needed 56 stars

233
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
tattooed on the right side of her face.

234
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
There is a girl, Julia Butterfly Hill,

235
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
who lived for a year in a tree

236
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
because she wanted to protect the wild oaks.

237
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
There is a girl who I met 14 years ago in Afghanistan

238
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
who I have adopted as my daughter

239
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
because her mother was killed. Her mother was a revolutionary.

240
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And this girl, when she was 17 years old,

241
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
wore a burqa in Afghanistan,

242
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and went into the stadiums

243
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and documented the atrocities that were going on towards women,

244
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
underneath her burqa, with a video.

245
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And that video became the video that went out all over the world

246
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
after 9/11 to show what was going on in Afghanistan.

247
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
I want to talk about Rachel Corrie

248
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
who was in her teens when she stood in front of an Israeli tank

249
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
to say, "End the occupation."

250
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down

251
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and rolled over by that tank.

252
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And I want to talk about a girl that I just met recently

253
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
in Bukavu, who was impregnated by her rapist.

254
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And she was holding her baby.

255
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And I asked her if she loved her baby.

256
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And she looked into her baby's eyes and she said,

257
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
"Of course I love my baby. How could I not love my baby?

258
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
It's my baby and it's full of love."

259
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
The capacity for girls to overcome situations

260
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and to move on levels, to me, is mind-blowing.

261
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
There is a girl named Dorcas, and I just met her in Kenya.

262
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Dorcas is 15 years old,

263
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and she was trained in self-defense.

264
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
A few months ago she was picked up on the street

265
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
by three older men.

266
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
They kidnapped her, they put her in a car.

267
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And through her self-defense, she grabbed their Adam's apples,

268
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
she punched them in the eyes

269
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and she got herself free and out of the car.

270
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
In Kenya, in August,

271
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I went to visit one of the V-Day safe houses for girls,

272
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
a house we opened seven years ago

273
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
with an amazing woman named Agnes Pareyio.

274
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl,

275
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
she was female genitally mutilated.

276
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And she made a decision as many women do across this planet,

277
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
that what was done to her would not be enforced and done

278
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
to other women and girls.

279
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
So, for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley.

280
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
She taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like,

281
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and what a mutilated vagina looked like.

282
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And in that time she saved many girls. And when we met her

283
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
we asked her what we could do for her,

284
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster."

285
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So, we got her a Jeep. And then she saved 4,500 girls.

286
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And then we asked her, "Okay, what else do you need?"

287
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And she said, "Well, now, I need a house."

288
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
So, seven years ago Agnes built the first V-Day safe house

289
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
in Narok, Kenya, in the Masai land.

290
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And it was a house where girls could run away,

291
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
they could save their clitoris, they wouldn't be cut,

292
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
they could go to school.

293
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And in the years that Agnes has had the house,

294
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
she has changed the situation there.

295
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
She has literally become deputy mayor.

296
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
She's changed the rules.

297
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
The whole community has bought in to what she's doing.

298
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
When we were there she was doing a ritual

299
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
where she reconciles girls, who have run away, with their families.

300
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And there was a young girl named Jaclyn.

301
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Jaclyn was 14 years old and she was in her Masai family

302
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and there's a drought in Kenya.

303
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
So cows are dying, and cows are the most

304
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
valued possession.

305
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And Jaclyn overheard her father

306
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
talking to an old man about

307
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
how he was about to sell her for the cows.

308
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And she knew that meant she would be cut.

309
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
She knew that meant she wouldn't go to school.

310
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
She knew that meant she wouldn't have a future.

311
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
She knew she would have to marry that old man, and she was 14.

312
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
So, one afternoon, she'd heard about the safe house,

313
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Jaclyn left her father's house

314
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and she walked for two days, two days

315
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
through Masai land.

316
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
She slept with the hyenas. She hid at night.

317
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
She imagined her father killing her on one hand,

318
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and Mama Agnes greeting her,

319
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house.

320
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And when she got to the house she was greeted.

321
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Agnes took her in, and Agnes loved her,

322
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and Agnes supported her for the year.

323
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
She went to school and she found her voice,

324
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and she found her identity, and she found her heart.

325
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Then, her time was ready

326
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
when she had to go back to talk to her father

327
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
about the reconciliation, after a year.

328
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I had the privilege of being in the hut

329
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
when she was reunited with her father and reconciled.

330
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
In that hut, we walked in,

331
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and her father and his four wives were sitting there,

332
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and her sisters who had just returned because

333
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
they had all fled when she had fled,

334
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and her primary mother, who had been beaten

335
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
in standing up for her with the elders.

336
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
When her father saw her and saw who she had become,

337
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
in her full girl self,

338
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
he threw his arms around her and broke down crying.

339
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
He said, "You are beautiful. You have grown into a gorgeous woman.

340
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
We will not cut you.

341
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
And I give you my word, here and now,

342
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
that we will not cut your sisters either."

343
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And what she said to him was,

344
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
"You were willing to sell me for four cows,

345
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and a calf and some blankets.

346
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
But I promise you, now that I will be educated

347
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
I will always take care of you,

348
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and I will come back and I will build you a house.

349
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
And I will be in your corner for the rest of your life."

350
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
For me, that is the power of girls.

351
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And that is the power of transformation.

352
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
I want to close today

353
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
with a new piece from my book.

354
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And I want to do it tonight

355
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
for the girl in everybody here.

356
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
And I want to do it for Sunitha.

357
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday,

358
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
the girls who survive, the girls who can become somebody else.

359
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
But I really want to do it for each and every person here,

360
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
to value the girl in us,

361
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
to value the part that cries,

362
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
to value the part that's emotional,

363
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
to value the part that's vulnerable,

364
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
to understand that's where the future lies.

365
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
This is called "I'm An Emotional Creature."

366
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And it happened because I met a girl in Watts, L.A.

367
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
I was asking girls if they like being a girl,

368
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and all the girls were like, "No, I hate it. I can't stand it.

369
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
It's all bad. My brothers get everything."

370
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And this girl just sat up and went, "I love being a girl.

371
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
I'm an emotional creature!"

372
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
(Laughter)

373
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
This is for her:

374
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
I love being a girl.

375
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
I can feel what you're feeling

376
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
as you're feeling inside the feeling before.

377
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
I am an emotional creature.

378
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Things do not come to me as intellectual theories

379
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
or hard-pressed ideas.

380
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
They pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears.

381
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Oh, I know when your girlfriend's really pissed off,

382
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
even though she appears to give you what you want.

383
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
I know when a storm is coming.

384
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
I can feel the invisible stirrings in the air.

385
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
I can tell you he won't call back. It's a vibe I share.

386
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
I am an emotional creature.

387
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
I love that I do not take things lightly.

388
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Everything is intense to me,

389
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
the way I walk in the street, the way my momma wakes me up,

390
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
the way it's unbearable when I lose, the way I hear bad news.

391
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
I am an emotional creature.

392
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
I am connected to everything and everyone. I was born like that.

393
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Don't you say all negative

394
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
that it's only only a teenage thing,

395
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
or it's only because I'm a girl.

396
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
These feelings make me better.

397
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
They make me present. They make me ready. They make me strong.

398
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
I am an emotional creature.

399
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
There is a particular way of knowing.

400
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
It's like the older women somehow forgot.

401
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
I rejoice that it's still in my body.

402
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Oh, I know when the coconut's about to fall.

403
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
I know we have pushed the Earth too far.

404
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
I know my father isn't coming back,

405
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
and that no one's prepared for the fire.

406
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
I know that lipstick means more than show,

407
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
and boys are super insecure,

408
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
and so-called terrorists are made, not born.

409
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
I know that one kiss

410
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
could take away all my decision-making ability.

411
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
(Laughter)

412
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
And you know what? Sometimes it should.

413
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
This is not extreme. It's a girl thing,

414
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open.

415
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
Don't tell me not to cry, to calm it down,

416
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
not to be so extreme, to be reasonable.

417
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
I am an emotional creature.

418
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
It's how the earth got made, how the wind continues to pollinate.

419
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
You don't tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave.

420
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
I am an emotional creature.

421
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
Why would you want to shut me down or turn me off?

422
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:47,000
I am your remaining memory.

423
0:18:47.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
I can take you back.

424
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
Nothing's been diluted.

425
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
Nothing's leaked out.

426
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
I love, hear me, I love

427
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
that I can feel the feelings inside you,

428
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
even if they stop my life,

429
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
even if they break my heart,

430
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
even if they take me off track,

431
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:11,000
they make me responsible.

432
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
I am an emotional, I am an emotional,

433
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
incondotional, devotional creature.

434
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:21,000
And I love, hear me,

435
0:19:21.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
I love, love, love being a girl.

436
0:19:25.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
Can you say it with me?

437
0:19:27.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
I love, I love, love, love

438
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:33,000
being a girl!

439
0:19:33.26,000 --> 0:19:35,000
Thank you very much.

440
0:19:35.26,000 --> 0:19:48,000
(Applause)

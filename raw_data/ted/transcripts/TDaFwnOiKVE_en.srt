1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
This is a photograph

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
by the artist Michael Najjar,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and it's real,

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in the sense that he went there to Argentina

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
to take the photo.

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But it's also a fiction. There's a lot of work that went into it after that.

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And what he's done

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
is he's actually reshaped, digitally,

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
all of the contours of the mountains

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to follow the vicissitudes of the Dow Jones index.

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So what you see,

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that precipice, that high precipice with the valley,

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
is the 2008 financial crisis.

14
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The photo was made

15
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
when we were deep in the valley over there.

16
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I don't know where we are now.

17
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
This is the Hang Seng index

18
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
for Hong Kong.

19
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And similar topography.

20
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I wonder why.

21
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
And this is art. This is metaphor.

22
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But I think the point is

23
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that this is metaphor with teeth,

24
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and it's with those teeth that I want to propose today

25
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that we rethink a little bit

26
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
about the role of contemporary math --

27
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
not just financial math, but math in general.

28
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
That its transition

29
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
from being something that we extract and derive from the world

30
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
to something that actually starts to shape it --

31
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
the world around us and the world inside us.

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And it's specifically algorithms,

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
which are basically the math

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that computers use to decide stuff.

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
They acquire the sensibility of truth

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
because they repeat over and over again,

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and they ossify and calcify,

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and they become real.

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And I was thinking about this, of all places,

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
on a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago,

41
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
because I happened to be seated

42
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
next to a Hungarian physicist about my age

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and we were talking

44
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
about what life was like during the Cold War

45
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
for physicists in Hungary.

46
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
And I said, "So what were you doing?"

47
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And he said, "Well we were mostly breaking stealth."

48
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And I said, "That's a good job. That's interesting.

49
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
How does that work?"

50
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And to understand that,

51
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
you have to understand a little bit about how stealth works.

52
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And so -- this is an over-simplification --

53
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but basically, it's not like

54
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
you can just pass a radar signal

55
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
right through 156 tons of steel in the sky.

56
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It's not just going to disappear.

57
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But if you can take this big, massive thing,

58
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and you could turn it into

59
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
a million little things --

60
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
something like a flock of birds --

61
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
well then the radar that's looking for that

62
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
has to be able to see

63
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
every flock of birds in the sky.

64
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And if you're a radar, that's a really bad job.

65
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And he said, "Yeah." He said, "But that's if you're a radar.

66
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So we didn't use a radar;

67
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
we built a black box that was looking for electrical signals,

68
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
electronic communication.

69
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication,

70
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we thought, 'Probably has something to do with the Americans.'"

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And I said, "Yeah.

72
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
That's good.

73
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So you've effectively negated

74
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
60 years of aeronautic research.

75
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
What's your act two?

76
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
What do you do when you grow up?"

77
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And he said,

78
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
"Well, financial services."

79
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And I said, "Oh."

80
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Because those had been in the news lately.

81
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And I said, "How does that work?"

82
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And he said, "Well there's 2,000 physicists on Wall Street now,

83
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and I'm one of them."

84
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And I said, "What's the black box for Wall Street?"

85
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And he said, "It's funny you ask that,

86
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
because it's actually called black box trading.

87
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And it's also sometimes called algo trading,

88
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
algorithmic trading."

89
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And algorithmic trading evolved in part

90
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
because institutional traders have the same problems

91
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that the United States Air Force had,

92
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
which is that they're moving these positions --

93
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
whether it's Proctor & Gamble or Accenture, whatever --

94
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
they're moving a million shares of something

95
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
through the market.

96
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And if they do that all at once,

97
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
it's like playing poker and going all in right away.

98
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
You just tip your hand.

99
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And so they have to find a way --

100
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and they use algorithms to do this --

101
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to break up that big thing

102
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
into a million little transactions.

103
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And the magic and the horror of that

104
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
is that the same math

105
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that you use to break up the big thing

106
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
into a million little things

107
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
can be used to find a million little things

108
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and sew them back together

109
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and figure out what's actually happening in the market.

110
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So if you need to have some image

111
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
of what's happening in the stock market right now,

112
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms

113
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that are basically programmed to hide,

114
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and a bunch of algorithms that are programmed to go find them and act.

115
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And all of that's great, and it's fine.

116
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And that's 70 percent

117
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
of the United States stock market,

118
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
70 percent of the operating system

119
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
formerly known as your pension,

120
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
your mortgage.

121
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And what could go wrong?

122
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
What could go wrong

123
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
is that a year ago,

124
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
nine percent of the entire market just disappears in five minutes,

125
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and they called it the Flash Crash of 2:45.

126
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
All of a sudden, nine percent just goes away,

127
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and nobody to this day

128
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
can even agree on what happened

129
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
because nobody ordered it, nobody asked for it.

130
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Nobody had any control over what was actually happening.

131
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
All they had

132
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
was just a monitor in front of them

133
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that had the numbers on it

134
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and just a red button

135
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that said, "Stop."

136
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And that's the thing,

137
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
is that we're writing things,

138
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
we're writing these things that we can no longer read.

139
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And we've rendered something

140
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
illegible,

141
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and we've lost the sense

142
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
of what's actually happening

143
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
in this world that we've made.

144
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And we're starting to make our way.

145
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
There's a company in Boston called Nanex,

146
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and they use math and magic

147
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and I don't know what,

148
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and they reach into all the market data

149
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and they find, actually sometimes, some of these algorithms.

150
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And when they find them they pull them out

151
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and they pin them to the wall like butterflies.

152
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And they do what we've always done

153
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
when confronted with huge amounts of data that we don't understand --

154
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
which is that they give them a name

155
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and a story.

156
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So this is one that they found,

157
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
they called the Knife,

158
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
the Carnival,

159
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
the Boston Shuffler,

160
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Twilight.

161
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And the gag is

162
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that, of course, these aren't just running through the market.

163
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
You can find these kinds of things wherever you look,

164
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
once you learn how to look for them.

165
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
You can find it here: this book about flies

166
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that you may have been looking at on Amazon.

167
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
You may have noticed it

168
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
when its price started at 1.7 million dollars.

169
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
It's out of print -- still ...

170
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
(Laughter)

171
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
If you had bought it at 1.7, it would have been a bargain.

172
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
A few hours later, it had gone up

173
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to 23.6 million dollars,

174
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
plus shipping and handling.

175
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And the question is:

176
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Nobody was buying or selling anything; what was happening?

177
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And you see this behavior on Amazon

178
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
as surely as you see it on Wall Street.

179
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And when you see this kind of behavior,

180
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
what you see is the evidence

181
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
of algorithms in conflict,

182
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
algorithms locked in loops with each other,

183
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
without any human oversight,

184
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
without any adult supervision

185
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
to say, "Actually, 1.7 million is plenty."

186
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Laughter)

187
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And as with Amazon, so it is with Netflix.

188
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And so Netflix has gone through

189
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
several different algorithms over the years.

190
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
They started with Cinematch, and they've tried a bunch of others --

191
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
there's Dinosaur Planet; there's Gravity.

192
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
They're using Pragmatic Chaos now.

193
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Pragmatic Chaos is, like all of Netflix algorithms,

194
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
trying to do the same thing.

195
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It's trying to get a grasp on you,

196
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
on the firmware inside the human skull,

197
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
so that it can recommend what movie

198
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
you might want to watch next --

199
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
which is a very, very difficult problem.

200
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But the difficulty of the problem

201
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and the fact that we don't really quite have it down,

202
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
it doesn't take away

203
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
from the effects Pragmatic Chaos has.

204
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Pragmatic Chaos, like all Netflix algorithms,

205
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
determines, in the end,

206
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
60 percent

207
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
of what movies end up being rented.

208
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So one piece of code

209
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
with one idea about you

210
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
is responsible for 60 percent of those movies.

211
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But what if you could rate those movies

212
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
before they get made?

213
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Wouldn't that be handy?

214
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Well, a few data scientists from the U.K. are in Hollywood,

215
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and they have "story algorithms" --

216
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
a company called Epagogix.

217
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And you can run your script through there,

218
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and they can tell you, quantifiably,

219
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that that's a 30 million dollar movie

220
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
or a 200 million dollar movie.

221
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And the thing is, is that this isn't Google.

222
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
This isn't information.

223
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
These aren't financial stats; this is culture.

224
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And what you see here,

225
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
or what you don't really see normally,

226
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
is that these are the physics of culture.

227
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And if these algorithms,

228
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
like the algorithms on Wall Street,

229
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
just crashed one day and went awry,

230
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
how would we know?

231
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
What would it look like?

232
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And they're in your house. They're in your house.

233
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
These are two algorithms competing for your living room.

234
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
These are two different cleaning robots

235
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that have very different ideas about what clean means.

236
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And you can see it

237
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
if you slow it down and attach lights to them,

238
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and they're sort of like secret architects in your bedroom.

239
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And the idea that architecture itself

240
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
is somehow subject to algorithmic optimization

241
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
is not far-fetched.

242
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
It's super-real and it's happening around you.

243
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
You feel it most

244
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
when you're in a sealed metal box,

245
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
a new-style elevator;

246
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
they're called destination-control elevators.

247
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
These are the ones where you have to press what floor you're going to go to

248
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
before you get in the elevator.

249
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And it uses what's called a bin-packing algorithm.

250
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So none of this mishegas

251
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
of letting everybody go into whatever car they want.

252
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Everybody who wants to go to the 10th floor goes into car two,

253
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and everybody who wants to go to the third floor goes into car five.

254
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And the problem with that

255
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
is that people freak out.

256
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
People panic.

257
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And you see why. You see why.

258
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
It's because the elevator

259
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
is missing some important instrumentation, like the buttons.

260
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
(Laughter)

261
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Like the things that people use.

262
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
All it has

263
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
is just the number that moves up or down

264
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and that red button that says, "Stop."

265
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And this is what we're designing for.

266
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
We're designing

267
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
for this machine dialect.

268
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And how far can you take that? How far can you take it?

269
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
You can take it really, really far.

270
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So let me take it back to Wall Street.

271
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Because the algorithms of Wall Street

272
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
are dependent on one quality above all else,

273
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
which is speed.

274
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And they operate on milliseconds and microseconds.

275
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And just to give you a sense of what microseconds are,

276
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
it takes you 500,000 microseconds

277
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
just to click a mouse.

278
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
But if you're a Wall Street algorithm

279
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and you're five microseconds behind,

280
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
you're a loser.

281
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So if you were an algorithm,

282
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
you'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt

283
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
who was hollowing out a skyscraper --

284
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
throwing out all the furniture, all the infrastructure for human use,

285
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and just running steel on the floors

286
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in --

287
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
all so an algorithm

288
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
could get close to the Internet.

289
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system.

290
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And of course, it is, but it's distributed from places.

291
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
In New York, this is where it's distributed from:

292
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
the Carrier Hotel

293
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
located on Hudson Street.

294
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And this is really where the wires come right up into the city.

295
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And the reality is that the further away you are from that,

296
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
you're a few microseconds behind every time.

297
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
These guys down on Wall Street,

298
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Marco Polo and Cherokee Nation,

299
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
they're eight microseconds

300
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
behind all these guys

301
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
going into the empty buildings being hollowed out

302
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
up around the Carrier Hotel.

303
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And that's going to keep happening.

304
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
We're going to keep hollowing them out,

305
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
because you, inch for inch

306
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and pound for pound and dollar for dollar,

307
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
none of you could squeeze revenue out of that space

308
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
like the Boston Shuffler could.

309
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
But if you zoom out,

310
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
if you zoom out,

311
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
you would see an 825-mile trench

312
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
between New York City and Chicago

313
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
that's been built over the last few years

314
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
by a company called Spread Networks.

315
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
This is a fiber optic cable

316
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
that was laid between those two cities

317
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
to just be able to traffic one signal

318
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
37 times faster than you can click a mouse --

319
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
just for these algorithms,

320
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
just for the Carnival and the Knife.

321
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And when you think about this,

322
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that we're running through the United States

323
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
with dynamite and rock saws

324
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
so that an algorithm can close the deal

325
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
three microseconds faster,

326
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
all for a communications framework

327
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
that no human will ever know,

328
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that's a kind of manifest destiny;

329
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and we'll always look for a new frontier.

330
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Unfortunately, we have our work cut out for us.

331
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
This is just theoretical.

332
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
This is some mathematicians at MIT.

333
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And the truth is I don't really understand

334
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
a lot of what they're talking about.

335
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
It involves light cones and quantum entanglement,

336
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and I don't really understand any of that.

337
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
But I can read this map,

338
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and what this map says

339
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
is that, if you're trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are,

340
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
that's where people are, where the cities are,

341
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
you're going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are

342
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
to do that most effectively.

343
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And the thing that you might have noticed about those blue dots

344
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
is that a lot of them are in the middle of the ocean.

345
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
So that's what we'll do: we'll build bubbles or something,

346
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
or platforms.

347
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
We'll actually part the water

348
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
to pull money out of the air,

349
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
because it's a bright future

350
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
if you're an algorithm.

351
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
(Laughter)

352
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And it's not the money that's so interesting actually.

353
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
It's what the money motivates,

354
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that we're actually terraforming

355
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
the Earth itself

356
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
with this kind of algorithmic efficiency.

357
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And in that light,

358
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
you go back

359
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and you look at Michael Najjar's photographs,

360
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and you realize that they're not metaphor, they're prophecy.

361
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
They're prophecy

362
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
for the kind of seismic, terrestrial effects

363
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
of the math that we're making.

364
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And the landscape was always made

365
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
by this sort of weird, uneasy collaboration

366
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
between nature and man.

367
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
But now there's this third co-evolutionary force: algorithms --

368
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
the Boston Shuffler, the Carnival.

369
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And we will have to understand those as nature,

370
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and in a way, they are.

371
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Thank you.

372
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
(Applause)

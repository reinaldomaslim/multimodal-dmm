2
0:00:12.051,000 --> 0:00:14,000
What I'm going to do is, I'm going to explain to you

3
0:00:15.014,000 --> 0:00:17,000
an extreme green concept

4
0:00:17.066,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that was developed at NASA's Glenn Research Center

5
0:00:20.058,000 --> 0:00:22,000
in Cleveland, Ohio.

6
0:00:22.06,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But before I do that, we have to go over

7
0:00:24.49,000 --> 0:00:25,000
the definition of what green is,

8
0:00:26.027,000 --> 0:00:28,000
'cause a lot of us have a different definition of it.

9
0:00:29.024,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Green. The product is created through

10
0:00:31.017,000 --> 0:00:33,000
environmentally and socially conscious means.

11
0:00:33.48,000 --> 0:00:36,000
There's plenty of things that are being called green now.

12
0:00:36.668,000 --> 0:00:37,000
What does it actually mean?

13
0:00:38.28,000 --> 0:00:41,000
We use three metrics to determine green.

14
0:00:41.923,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The first metric is: Is it sustainable?

15
0:00:45.015,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Which means, are you preserving what you are doing for future use

16
0:00:48.539,000 --> 0:00:5,000
or for future generations?

17
0:00:51.034,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Is it alternative? Is it different than what is being used today,

18
0:00:55.007,000 --> 0:00:57,000
or does it have a lower carbon footprint

19
0:00:57.812,000 --> 0:00:59,000
than what's used conventionally?

20
0:01:00.396,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And three: Is it renewable?

21
0:01:03.231,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Does it come from Earth's natural replenishing resources,

22
0:01:06.987,000 --> 0:01:09,000
such as sun, wind and water?

23
0:01:10.087,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Now, my task at NASA is to develop

24
0:01:13.619,000 --> 0:01:16,000
the next generation of aviation fuels.

25
0:01:16.815,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Extreme green. Why aviation?

26
0:01:19.644,000 --> 0:01:22,000
The field of aviation uses more fuel than just about

27
0:01:23.001,000 --> 0:01:28,000
every other combined. We need to find an alternative.

28
0:01:28.017,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Also it's a national aeronautics directive.

29
0:01:31.017,000 --> 0:01:33,000
One of the national aeronautics goals is to develop

30
0:01:33.685,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the next generation of fuels, biofuels,

31
0:01:36.381,000 --> 0:01:39,000
using domestic and safe, friendly resources.

32
0:01:40.091,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Now, combating that challenge

33
0:01:42.959,000 --> 0:01:44,000
we have to also meet the big three metric —

34
0:01:45.849,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Actually, extreme green for us is all three together;

35
0:01:49.662,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that's why you see the plus there. I was told to say that.

36
0:01:52.052,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So it has to be the big three at GRC. That's another metric.

37
0:01:57.049,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Ninety-seven percent of the world's water is saltwater.

38
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:07,000
How about we use that? Combine that with number three.

39
0:02:07.01,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Do not use arable land.

40
0:02:10.042,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Because crops are already growing on that land

41
0:02:12.222,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that's very scarce around the world.

42
0:02:15.019,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Number two: Don't compete with food crops.

43
0:02:18.026,000 --> 0:02:22,000
That's already a well established entity, they don't need another entry.

44
0:02:22.443,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And lastly the most precious resource we have on this Earth

45
0:02:26.391,000 --> 0:02:3,000
is fresh water. Don't use fresh water.

46
0:02:31.051,000 --> 0:02:33,000
If 97.5 percent of the world's water is saltwater,

47
0:02:34.022,000 --> 0:02:37,000
2.5 percent is fresh water. Less than a half percent

48
0:02:37.299,000 --> 0:02:38,000
of that is accessible for human use.

49
0:02:39.06,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But 60 percent of the population lives within that one percent.

50
0:02:43.021,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So, combating my problem was, now I have to be extreme green

51
0:02:48.013,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and meet the big three. Ladies and gentlemen,

52
0:02:50.261,000 --> 0:02:53,000
welcome to the GreenLab Research Facility.

53
0:02:54.007,000 --> 0:02:56,000
This is a facility dedicated to the next generation

54
0:02:56.942,000 --> 0:02:59,000
of aviation fuels using halophytes.

55
0:03:00.087,000 --> 0:03:02,000
A halophyte is a salt-tolerating plant.

56
0:03:03.065,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Most plants don't like salt, but halophytes tolerate salt.

57
0:03:07.093,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We also are using weeds

58
0:03:10.088,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and we are also using algae.

59
0:03:13.019,000 --> 0:03:14,000
The good thing about our lab is, we've had

60
0:03:15.01,000 --> 0:03:18,000
3,600 visitors in the last two years.

61
0:03:18.02,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Why do you think that's so?

62
0:03:20.022,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Because we are on to something special.

63
0:03:24.028,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So, in the lower you see the GreenLab obviously,

64
0:03:26.597,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and on the right hand side you'll see algae.

65
0:03:29.049,000 --> 0:03:31,000
If you are into the business of the next generation

66
0:03:32.002,000 --> 0:03:34,000
of aviation fuels, algae is a viable option,

67
0:03:34.322,000 --> 0:03:35,000
there's a lot of funding right now,

68
0:03:36.001,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and we have an algae to fuels program.

69
0:03:38.022,000 --> 0:03:4,000
There's two types of algae growing.

70
0:03:40.022,000 --> 0:03:42,000
One is a closed photobioreactor that you see here,

71
0:03:43.015,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and what you see on the other side is our species —

72
0:03:47.036,000 --> 0:03:5,000
we are currently using a species called Scenedesmus dimorphus.

73
0:03:51.006,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Our job at NASA is to take the experimental and computational

74
0:03:55.312,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and make a better mixing for the closed photobioreactors.

75
0:04:00.007,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Now the problems with closed photobioreactors are:

76
0:04:02.044,000 --> 0:04:04,000
They are quite expensive, they are automated,

77
0:04:04.775,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and it's very difficult to get them in large scale.

78
0:04:07.803,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So on large scale what do they use?

79
0:04:09.428,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We use open pond systems. Now, around the world

80
0:04:12.921,000 --> 0:04:15,000
they are growing algae, with this racetrack design

81
0:04:16.442,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that you see here. Looks like an oval with

82
0:04:18.891,000 --> 0:04:2,000
a paddle wheel and mixes really well,

83
0:04:21.028,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but when it gets around the last turn, which I call turn four — it's stagnant.

84
0:04:25.086,000 --> 0:04:26,000
We actually have a solution for that.

85
0:04:27.076,000 --> 0:04:29,000
In the GreenLab in our open pond system

86
0:04:30.04,000 --> 0:04:33,000
we use something that happens in nature: waves.

87
0:04:33.055,000 --> 0:04:36,000
We actually use wave technology on our open pond systems.

88
0:04:36.747,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We have 95 percent mixing and our lipid content is higher

89
0:04:41.431,000 --> 0:04:43,000
than a closed photobioreactor system,

90
0:04:44.049,000 --> 0:04:45,000
which we think is significant.

91
0:04:46.03,000 --> 0:04:5,000
There is a drawback to algae, however: It's very expensive.

92
0:04:50.062,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Is there a way to produce algae inexpensively?

93
0:04:55.165,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And the answer is: yes.

94
0:04:57.026,000 --> 0:05:,000
We do the same thing we do with halophytes,

95
0:05:00.049,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and that is: climatic adaptation.

96
0:05:04.004,000 --> 0:05:06,000
In our GreenLab we have six primary ecosystems

97
0:05:06.816,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that range from freshwater all the way to saltwater.

98
0:05:10.787,000 --> 0:05:13,000
What we do: We take a potential species, we start at freshwater,

99
0:05:14.546,000 --> 0:05:16,000
we add a little bit more salt, when the second tank here

100
0:05:17.274,000 --> 0:05:19,000
will be the same ecosystem as Brazil —

101
0:05:19.406,000 --> 0:05:22,000
right next to the sugar cane fields you can have our plants —

102
0:05:22.502,000 --> 0:05:26,000
the next tank represents Africa, the next tank represents Arizona,

103
0:05:26.745,000 --> 0:05:28,000
the next tank represents Florida,

104
0:05:29.056,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and the next tank represents California or the open ocean.

105
0:05:32.919,000 --> 0:05:36,000
What we are trying to do is to come up with a single species

106
0:05:37.014,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that can survive anywhere in the world, where there's barren desert.

107
0:05:43.019,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We are being very successful so far.

108
0:05:45.057,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now, here's one of the problems.

109
0:05:47.701,000 --> 0:05:52,000
If you are a farmer, you need five things to be successful: You need seeds,

110
0:05:53.428,000 --> 0:05:56,000
you need soil, you need water and you need sun,

111
0:05:57.043,000 --> 0:06:,000
and the last thing that you need is fertilizer.

112
0:06:00.613,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Most people use chemical fertilizers. But guess what?

113
0:06:04.168,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We do not use chemical fertilizer.

114
0:06:06.868,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Wait a second! I just saw lots of greenery in your GreenLab. You have to use fertilizer.

115
0:06:12.023,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Believe it or not, in our analysis of our saltwater ecosystems

116
0:06:16.228,000 --> 0:06:19,000
80 percent of what we need are in these tanks themselves.

117
0:06:20.028,000 --> 0:06:23,000
The 20 percent that's missing is nitrogen and phosphorous.

118
0:06:24.027,000 --> 0:06:26,000
We have a natural solution: fish.

119
0:06:26.083,000 --> 0:06:29,000
No we don't cut up the fish and put them in there.

120
0:06:29.971,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Fish waste is what we use. As a matter of fact

121
0:06:33.854,000 --> 0:06:37,000
we use freshwater mollies, that we've used our climatic adaptation technique

122
0:06:38.019,000 --> 0:06:41,000
from freshwater all the way to seawater.

123
0:06:41.041,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Freshwater mollies: cheap, they love to make babies,

124
0:06:48.037,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and they love to go to the bathroom.

125
0:06:49.846,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And the more they go to the bathroom, the more fertilizer we get,

126
0:06:52.001,000 --> 0:06:54,000
the better off we are, believe it or not.

127
0:06:54.54,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It should be noted that we use sand as our soil,

128
0:06:59.805,000 --> 0:07:03,000
regular beach sand. Fossilized coral.

129
0:07:04.03,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So a lot of people ask me, "How did you get started?"

130
0:07:08.001,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Well, we got started in what we call the indoor biofuels lab.

131
0:07:13.006,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It's a seedling lab. We have 26 different species of halophytes,

132
0:07:17.412,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and five are winners. What we do here is —

133
0:07:20.684,000 --> 0:07:22,000
actually it should be called a death lab, 'cause we try to

134
0:07:23.509,000 --> 0:07:25,000
kill the seedlings, make them rough —

135
0:07:26.098,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and then we come to the GreenLab.

136
0:07:28.418,000 --> 0:07:29,000
What you see in the lower corner

137
0:07:30.176,000 --> 0:07:32,000
is a wastewater treatment plant experiment

138
0:07:32.364,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that we are growing, a macro-algae that I'll talk about in a minute.

139
0:07:36.057,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And lastly, it's me actually working in the lab to prove to you I do work,

140
0:07:40.043,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I don't just talk about what I do.

141
0:07:43.775,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Here's the plant species. Salicornia virginica.

142
0:07:47.005,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It's a wonderful plant. I love that plant.

143
0:07:50.564,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Everywhere we go we see it. It's all over the place, from Maine

144
0:07:54.03,000 --> 0:07:57,000
all the way to California. We love that plant.

145
0:07:57.041,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Second is Salicornia bigelovii. Very difficult to get around the world.

146
0:08:02.006,000 --> 0:08:04,000
It is the highest lipid content that we have,

147
0:08:04.052,000 --> 0:08:07,000
but it has a shortcoming: It's short.

148
0:08:08.042,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Now you take europaea, which is the largest or the tallest plant that we have.

149
0:08:13.163,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And what we are trying to do

150
0:08:15.081,000 --> 0:08:19,000
with natural selection or adaptive biology — combine all three

151
0:08:19.462,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to make a high-growth, high-lipid plant.

152
0:08:23.578,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Next, when a hurricane decimated the Delaware Bay — soybean fields gone —

153
0:08:30.842,000 --> 0:08:32,000
we came up with an idea: Can you have a plant

154
0:08:33.706,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that has a land reclamation positive in Delaware? And the answer is yes.

155
0:08:39.017,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It's called seashore mallow. Kosteletzkya virginica —

156
0:08:42.991,000 --> 0:08:45,000
say that five times fast if you can.

157
0:08:46.009,000 --> 0:08:53,000
This is a 100 percent usable plant. The seeds: biofuels. The rest: cattle feed.

158
0:08:53.597,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It's there for 10 years; it's working very well.

159
0:08:57.036,000 --> 0:09:,000
Now we get to Chaetomorpha.

160
0:09:00.363,000 --> 0:09:03,000
This is a macro-algae that loves

161
0:09:03.585,000 --> 0:09:05,000
excess nutrients. If you are in the aquarium industry

162
0:09:06.007,000 --> 0:09:08,000
you know we use it to clean up dirty tanks.

163
0:09:08.818,000 --> 0:09:12,000
This species is so significant to us.

164
0:09:13.029,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The properties are very close to plastic.

165
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:22,000
We are trying right now to convert this macro-algae into a bioplastic.

166
0:09:22.378,000 --> 0:09:26,000
If we are successful, we will revolutionize the plastics industry.

167
0:09:27.051,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So, we have a seed to fuel program.

168
0:09:30.573,000 --> 0:09:32,000
We have to do something with this biomass that we have.

169
0:09:33.53,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And so we do G.C. extraction, lipid optimization, so on and so forth,

170
0:09:38.039,000 --> 0:09:41,000
because our goal really is to come up with

171
0:09:41.726,000 --> 0:09:44,000
the next generation of aviation fuels, aviation specifics, so on and so forth.

172
0:09:45.636,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So far we talked about water and fuel,

173
0:09:50.056,000 --> 0:09:56,000
but along the way we found out something interesting about Salicornia:

174
0:09:57,000 --> 0:10:,000
It's a food product.

175
0:10:00.686,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So we talk about ideas worth spreading, right?

176
0:10:03.499,000 --> 0:10:09,000
How about this: In sub-Saharan Africa, next to the sea, saltwater,

177
0:10:10.353,000 --> 0:10:14,000
barren desert, how about we take that plant,

178
0:10:15.212,000 --> 0:10:19,000
plant it, half use for food, half use for fuel.

179
0:10:20.044,000 --> 0:10:23,000
We can make that happen, inexpensively.

180
0:10:23.845,000 --> 0:10:25,000
You can see there's a greenhouse in Germany

181
0:10:26.543,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that sells it as a health food product.

182
0:10:29.007,000 --> 0:10:34,000
This is harvested, and in the middle here is a shrimp dish, and it's being pickled.

183
0:10:34.233,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So I have to tell you a joke. Salicornia is known as sea beans,

184
0:10:38.846,000 --> 0:10:41,000
saltwater asparagus and pickle weed.

185
0:10:42.319,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So we are pickling pickle weed in the middle.

186
0:10:45.05,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Oh, I thought it was funny. (Laughter)

187
0:10:47.852,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And at the bottom is seaman's mustard. It does make sense,

188
0:10:51.225,000 --> 0:10:53,000
this is a logical snack. You have mustard,

189
0:10:53.612,000 --> 0:10:56,000
you are a seaman, you see the halophyte, you mix it together,

190
0:10:56.76,000 --> 0:10:58,000
it's a great snack with some crackers.

191
0:10:59.022,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And last, garlic with Salicornia, which is what I like.

192
0:11:06.022,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So, water, fuel and food.

193
0:11:10.997,000 --> 0:11:13,000
None of this is possible without the GreenLab team.

194
0:11:14.548,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Just like the Miami Heat has the big three, we have the big three at NASA GRC.

195
0:11:19.529,000 --> 0:11:24,000
That's myself, professor Bob Hendricks, our fearless leader, and Dr. Arnon Chait.

196
0:11:25.008,000 --> 0:11:29,000
The backbone of the GreenLab is students.

197
0:11:29.537,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Over the last two years we've had 35 different students

198
0:11:33.452,000 --> 0:11:36,000
from around the world working at GreenLab.

199
0:11:36.607,000 --> 0:11:4,000
As a matter fact my division chief says a lot, "You have a green university."

200
0:11:41.016,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I say, "I'm okay with that, 'cause we are nurturing

201
0:11:43.551,000 --> 0:11:48,000
the next generation of extreme green thinkers, which is significant."

202
0:11:48.575,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So, in first summary I presented to you what we think

203
0:11:53.896,000 --> 0:11:59,000
is a global solution for food, fuel and water.

204
0:12:00.023,000 --> 0:12:02,000
There's something missing to be complete.

205
0:12:03.017,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Clearly we use electricity. We have a solution for you —

206
0:12:07.808,000 --> 0:12:1,000
We're using clean energy sources here.

207
0:12:11.057,000 --> 0:12:15,000
So, we have two wind turbines connected to the GreenLab,

208
0:12:15.478,000 --> 0:12:18,000
we have four or five more hopefully coming soon.

209
0:12:19.005,000 --> 0:12:22,000
We are also using something that is quite interesting —

210
0:12:22.615,000 --> 0:12:26,000
there is a solar array field at NASA's Glenn Research Center,

211
0:12:27.238,000 --> 0:12:3,000
hasn't been used for 15 years.

212
0:12:30.38,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Along with some of my electrical engineering colleagues,

213
0:12:33.143,000 --> 0:12:35,000
we realized that they are still viable,

214
0:12:35.286,000 --> 0:12:37,000
so we are refurbishing them right now.

215
0:12:38.042,000 --> 0:12:43,000
In about 30 days or so they'll be connected to the GreenLab.

216
0:12:43.078,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And the reason why you see red, red and yellow, is

217
0:12:46.004,000 --> 0:12:49,000
a lot of people think NASA employees don't work on Saturday —

218
0:12:49.271,000 --> 0:12:51,000
This is a picture taken on Saturday.

219
0:12:52.189,000 --> 0:12:56,000
There are no cars around, but you see my truck in yellow. I work on Saturday. (Laughter)

220
0:12:56.814,000 --> 0:12:57,000
This is a proof to you that I'm working.

221
0:12:58.647,000 --> 0:13:01,000
'Cause we do what it takes to get the job done, most people know that.

222
0:13:02.547,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Here's a concept with this:

223
0:13:05.425,000 --> 0:13:1,000
We are using the GreenLab for a micro-grid test bed

224
0:13:10.981,000 --> 0:13:14,000
for the smart grid concept in Ohio.

225
0:13:15.044,000 --> 0:13:2,000
We have the ability to do that, and I think it's going to work.

226
0:13:20.951,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So, GreenLab Research Facility.

227
0:13:26.044,000 --> 0:13:31,000
A self-sustainable renewable energy ecosystem was presented today.

228
0:13:31.067,000 --> 0:13:36,000
We really, really hope this concept catches on worldwide.

229
0:13:37.014,000 --> 0:13:46,000
We think we have a solution for food, water, fuel and now energy. Complete.

230
0:13:46.064,000 --> 0:13:52,000
It's extreme green, it's sustainable, alternative and renewable

231
0:13:52.189,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and it meets the big three at GRC:

232
0:13:56.027,000 --> 0:14:,000
Don't use arable land, don't compete with food crops,

233
0:14:01.018,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and most of all, don't use fresh water.

234
0:14:04.08,000 --> 0:14:08,000
So I get a lot of questions about, "What are you doing in that lab?"

235
0:14:09.054,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And I usually say, "None of your business, that's what I'm doing in the lab." (Laughter)

236
0:14:14.807,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And believe it or not, my number one goal

237
0:14:18.35,000 --> 0:14:2,000
for working on this project is

238
0:14:21.06,000 --> 0:14:25,000
I want to help save the world.

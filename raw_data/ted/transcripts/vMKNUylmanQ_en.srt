1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
When you think about resilience and technology it's actually much easier.

2
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:32,000
You're going to see some other speakers today, I already know,

3
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:35,000
who are going to talk about breaking-bones stuff,

4
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and, of course, with technology it never is.

5
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So it's very easy, comparatively speaking, to be resilient.

6
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I think that, if we look at what happened on the Internet,

7
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:47,000
with such an incredible last half a dozen years,

8
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that it's hard to even get the right analogy for it.

9
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:54,000
A lot of how we decide, how we're supposed to react to things

10
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and what we're supposed to expect about the future

11
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:58,000
depends on how we bucket things

12
0:00:58,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and how we categorize them.

13
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And so I think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust

14
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush.

15
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It's easy to think of this analogy as very different

16
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:12,000
from some of the other things you might pick.

17
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:14,000
For one thing, both were very real.

18
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:18,000
In 1849, in that Gold Rush, they took over $700 million

19
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:2,000
worth of gold out of California. It was very real.

20
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:24,000
The Internet was also very real. This is a real way for humans to

21
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
communicate with each other. It's a big deal.

22
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Huge boom. Huge boom. Huge bust. Huge bust.

23
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:34,000
You keep going, and both things are lots of hype.

24
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I don't have to remind you of all the hype

25
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that was involved with the Internet -- like GetRich.com.

26
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But you had the same thing with the Gold Rush. "Gold. Gold. Gold."

27
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Sixty-eight rich men on the Steamer Portland. Stacks of yellow metal.

28
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Some have 5,000. Many have more.

29
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:53,000
A few bring out 100,000 dollars each.

30
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:57,000
People would get very excited about this when they read these articles.

31
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:,000
"The Eldorado of the United States of America:

32
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in California."

33
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And the parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly.

34
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So many people left what they were doing.

35
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And what would happen is -- and the Gold Rush went on for years.

36
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
People on the East Coast in 1849, when they first started to get the news,

37
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:22,000
they thought, "Ah, this isn't real."

38
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But they keep hearing about people getting rich,

39
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and then in 1850 they still hear that. And they think it's not real.

40
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:33,000
By about 1852, they're thinking, "Am I the stupidest person on Earth

41
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
by not rushing to California?" And they start to decide they are.

42
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:39,000
These are community affairs, by the way.

43
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Local communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams

44
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:45,000
of 10, 20 people would caravan across the United States,

45
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and they would form companies.

46
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:5,000
These were typically not solitary efforts. But no matter what,

47
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:53,000
if you were a lawyer or a banker, people dropped what they were doing,

48
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:56,000
no matter what skill set they had, to go pan for gold.

49
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:,000
This guy on the left, Dr. Richard Beverley Cole,

50
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:03,000
he lived in Philadelphia and he took the Panama route.

51
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:06,000
They would take a ship down to Panama, across the isthmus,

52
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and then take another ship north.

53
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:12,000
This guy, Dr. Toland, went by covered wagon to California.

54
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:17,000
This has its parallels, too. Doctors leaving their practices.

55
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:19,000
These are both very successful -- a physician in one case,

56
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:2,000
a surgeon in the other.

57
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Same thing happened on the Internet. You get DrKoop.com.

58
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:25,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:28,000
In the Gold Rush, people literally jumped ship.

60
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:35,000
The San Francisco harbor was clogged with 600 ships at the peak

61
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:37,000
because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon

62
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to go search for gold.

63
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So there were literally 600 captains and 600 ships.

64
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
They turned the ships into hotels, because they couldn't sail them anywhere.

65
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:51,000
You had dotcom fever. And you had gold fever.

66
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And you saw some of the excesses

67
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened.

68
0:03:57,000 --> 0:04:01,000
The fort in San Francisco at the time had about 1,300 soldiers.

69
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Half of them deserted to go look for gold.

70
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half

71
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:1,000
because they were afraid they wouldn't come back.

72
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Laughter)

73
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And one of the soldiers wrote home, and this is the sentence that he put:

74
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:19,000
"The struggle between right and six dollars a month

75
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and wrong and 75 dollars a day is a rather severe one."

76
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:31,000
They had bad burn rate in the Gold Rush. A very bad burn rate.

77
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:35,000
This is actually from the Klondike Gold Rush. This is the White Pass Trail.

78
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:39,000
They loaded up their mules and their horses.

79
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And they didn't plan right.

80
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And they didn't know how far they would really have to go,

81
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff.

82
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:54,000
In fact it was so bad that most of the horses died

83
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:56,000
before they could get where they were going.

84
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It got renamed the "Dead Horse Trail."

85
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And the Canadian Minister of the Interior wrote this at the time:

86
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:05,000
"Thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way,

87
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:07,000
sometimes in bunches under the cliffs,

88
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:11,000
with pack saddles and packs where they've fallen from the rock above,

89
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:14,000
sometimes in tangled masses, filling the mud holes

90
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march,

91
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:21,000
often, I regret to say, exhausted, but still alive,

92
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:24,000
a fact we were unaware of, until after the miserable wretches

93
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:27,000
turned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade.

94
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:29,000
The eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere

95
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:32,000
account for the myriads of ravens along the road.

96
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:34,000
The inhumanity which this trail has been witness to,

97
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone,

98
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:41,000
cannot be imagined. They certainly cannot be described."

99
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And you know, without the smell that would have accompanied that,

100
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:52,000
we had the same thing on the Internet: very bad burn rate calculations.

101
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I'll just play one of these and you'll remember it.

102
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:59,000
This is a commercial that was played on the Super Bowl in the year 2000.

103
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Video): Bride #1: You said you had a large selection of invitations. Clerk: But we do.

104
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Bride #2: Then why does she have my invitation?

105
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Announcer: What may be a little thing to some ... Bride #3: You are mine, little man.

106
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Announcer: Could be a really big deal to you. Husband #1: Is that your wife?

107
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Husband #2: Not for another 15 minutes. Announcer: After all, it's your special day.

108
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:26,000
OurBeginning.com. Life's an event. Announce it to the world.

109
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Jeff Bezos: It's very difficult to figure out what that ad is for.

110
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Laughter)

111
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But they spent three and a half million dollars

112
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in the 2000 Super Bowl to air that ad,

113
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
even though, at the time, they only had a million dollars in annual revenue.

114
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Now, here's where our analogy with the Gold Rush starts to diverge,

115
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and I think rather severely.

116
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And that is, in a gold rush, when it's over, it's over.

117
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Here's this guy: "There are many men in Dawson

118
0:06:57,000 --> 0:06:59,000
at the present time who feel keenly disappointed.

119
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:04,000
They've come thousands of miles on a perilous trip, risked life, health and property,

120
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:07,000
spent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform

121
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and at length with expectations raised to the highest pitch

122
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:12,000
have reached the coveted goal only to discover

123
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:16,000
the fact that there is nothing here for them."

124
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And that was, of course, the very common story.

125
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Because when you take out that last piece of gold --

126
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and they did incredibly quickly. I mean, if you look at the 1849 Gold Rush --

127
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
the entire American river region, within two years --

128
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:33,000
every stone had been turned. And after that, only big companies

129
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
who used more sophisticated mining technologies

130
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:38,000
started to take gold out of there.

131
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic

132
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and that analogy is the electric industry.

133
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry.

134
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:56,000
With the electric industry you actually have to --

135
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:58,000
one of them is that they're both sort of thin,

136
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:01,000
horizontal, enabling layers that go across lots of different industries.

137
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:04,000
It's not a specific thing.

138
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:1,000
But electricity is also very, very broad, so you have to sort of narrow it down.

139
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:14,000
You know, it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power.

140
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It's an incredible means of coordinating,

141
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
in a very fine-grained way, information flows.

142
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:21,000
There's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity.

143
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on

144
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
is sort of the golden age of appliances.

145
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:34,000
The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb.

146
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So the light bulb is what wired the world.

147
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world.

148
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:42,000
They were really thinking about --

149
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:44,000
they weren't putting electricity into the home;

150
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:47,000
they were putting lighting into the home.

151
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And, but it really -- it got the electricity. It took a long time.

152
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:55,000
This was a huge -- as you would expect -- a huge capital build out.

153
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:58,000
All the streets had to be torn up.

154
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:02,000
This is work going on down in lower Manhattan

155
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:06,000
where they built some of the first electric power generating stations.

156
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And they're tearing up all the streets.

157
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:11,000
The Edison Electric Company, which became Edison General Electric,

158
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:13,000
which became General Electric,

159
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:18,000
paid for all of this digging up of the streets. It was incredibly expensive.

160
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:26,000
But that is not the -- and that's not the part that's really most similar to the Web.

161
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Because, remember, the Web got to stand

162
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:3,000
on top of all this heavy infrastructure

163
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network.

164
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure --

165
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I'm going back now to, sort of, the explosive part of the Web in 1994,

166
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:42,000
when it was growing 2,300 percent a year.

167
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:45,000
How could it grow at 2,300 percent a year in 1994

168
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:48,000
when people weren't really investing in the Web?

169
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Well, it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down.

170
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure,

171
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and then home appliances started coming into being.

172
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And this was huge. The first one was the electric fan --

173
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:04,000
this was the 1890 electric fan.

174
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And the appliances, the golden age of appliances really lasted --

175
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:1,000
it depends how you want to measure it --

176
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:13,000
but it's anywhere from 40 to 60 years. It goes on a long time.

177
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:18,000
It starts about 1890. And the electric fan was a big success.

178
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:22,000
The electric iron, also very big.

179
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:26,000
By the way, this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit.

180
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Laughter)

181
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:3,000
There's asbestos under that handle there.

182
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:35,000
This is the first vacuum cleaner, the 1905 Skinner Vacuum,

183
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:4,000
from the Hoover Company. And this one weighed 92 pounds

184
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car.

185
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So it wasn't a big seller.

186
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:51,000
This was truly, truly an early-adopter product --

187
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Laughter)

188
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the 1905 Skinner Vacuum.

189
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:57,000
But three years later, by 1908, it weighed 40 pounds.

190
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Now, not all these things were highly successful.

191
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:05,000
(Laughter)

192
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:08,000
This is the electric tie press, which never really did catch on.

193
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:13,000
People, I guess, decided that they would not wrinkle their ties.

194
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:17,000
These never really caught on either:

195
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:21,000
the electric shoe warmer and drier. Never a big seller.

196
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:23,000
This came in, like, six different colors.

197
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:24,000
(Laughter)

198
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:28,000
I don't know why. But I thought, you know,

199
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:32,000
sometimes it's just not the right time for an invention;

200
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:35,000
maybe it's time to give this one another shot.

201
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So I thought we could build a Super Bowl ad for this.

202
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:43,000
We'd need the right partner. And I thought that really --

203
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:45,000
(Laughter)

204
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I thought that would really work, to give that another shot.

205
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Now, the toaster was huge

206
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:54,000
because they used to make toast on open fires,

207
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and it took a lot of time and attention.

208
0:11:56,000 --> 0:12:02,000
I want to point out one thing. This is -- you guys know what this is.

209
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:05,000
They hadn't invented the electric socket yet.

210
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So this was -- remember, they didn't wire the houses for electricity.

211
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:12,000
They wired them for lighting. So your -- your appliances would plug in.

212
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:15,000
They would -- each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top.

213
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And you'd plug it in there.

214
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:2,000
In fact, if you've seen the Carousel of Progress at Disney World,

215
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:24,000
you've seen this. Here are the cables coming up into this light fixture.

216
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:28,000
All the appliances plug in there. And you would just unscrew your light bulb

217
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:3,000
if you wanted to plug in an appliance.

218
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:35,000
The next thing that really was a big, big deal was the washing machine.

219
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Now, this was an object of much envy and lust.

220
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines.

221
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:43,000
On the left-hand side, this was the soapy water.

222
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And there's a rotor there -- that this motor is spinning.

223
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And it would clean your clothes.

224
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:5,000
This is the clean rinse-water. So you'd take the clothes out of here,

225
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:54,000
put them in here, and then you'd run the clothes through this electric wringer.

226
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And this was a big deal.

227
0:12:56,000 --> 0:13:,000
You'd keep this on your porch. It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain.

228
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And you'd run a long cord into the house

229
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:06,000
where you could screw it into your light socket.

230
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:07,000
(Laughter)

231
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And that's actually kind of an important point in my presentation,

232
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:14,000
because they hadn't invented the off switch.

233
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:17,000
That was to come much later -- the off switch on appliances --

234
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:19,000
because it didn't make any sense.

235
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I mean, you didn't want this thing clogging up a light socket.

236
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So you know, when you were done with it, you unscrewed it.

237
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:27,000
That's what you did. You didn't turn it off.

238
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And as I said before, they hadn't invented the electric outlet either,

239
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:34,000
so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device.

240
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And there are --

241
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:39,000
when you research this, there are gruesome descriptions

242
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:44,000
of people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices.

243
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And they couldn't yank the cord out

244
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:5,000
because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house.

245
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:51,000
(Laughter)

246
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And there was no off switch, so it wasn't very good.

247
0:13:56,000 --> 0:14:,000
And you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors

248
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:03,000
to be plugging things into a light socket like this.

249
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:07,000
But, you know, before I get too far into condemning our ancestors,

250
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:1,000
I thought I'd show you: this is my conference room.

251
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:13,000
This is a total kludge, if you ask me.

252
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:16,000
First of all, this got installed upside down. This light socket --

253
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
(Laughter)

254
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and so the cord keeps falling out, so I taped it in.

255
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:21,000
(Laughter)

256
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:25,000
This is supposed -- don't even get me started. But that's not the worst one.

257
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:27,000
This is what it looks like under my desk.

258
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I took this picture just two days ago.

259
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:33,000
So we really haven't progressed that much since 1908.

260
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
(Laughter)

261
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:37,000
It's a total, total mess.

262
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And, you know, we think it's getting better,

263
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:44,000
but have you tried to install 802.11 yourself?

264
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:45,000
(Laughter)

265
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:47,000
I challenge you to try. It's very hard.

266
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:5,000
I know Ph.D.s in Computer Science --

267
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:53,000
this process has brought them to tears, absolute tears. (Laughter)

268
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And that's assuming you already have DSL in your house.

269
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Try to get DSL installed in your house.

270
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:05,000
The engineers who do it everyday can't do it.

271
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:08,000
They have to -- typically, they come three times.

272
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And one friend of mine was telling me a story:

273
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:13,000
not only did they get there and have to wait,

274
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:16,000
but then the engineers, when they finally did get there,

275
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
for the third time, they had to call somebody.

276
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone

277
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:23,000
because then they had to wait on hold for an hour

278
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:25,000
to talk to somebody to give them an access code

279
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:27,000
after they got there.

280
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:31,000
So we're not -- we're pretty kludge-y ourselves.

281
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:33,000
By the way, DSL is a kludge.

282
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
I mean, this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed

283
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:37,000
for the purpose it's being put to --

284
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:39,000
you know it's the whole thing --

285
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:43,000
we're very, very primitive. And that's kind of the point.

286
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Because, you know, resilience -- if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush,

287
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:49,000
then you'd be pretty depressed right now

288
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:52,000
because the last nugget of gold would be gone.

289
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:55,000
But the good thing is, with innovation, there isn't a last nugget.

290
0:15:55,000 --> 0:16:,000
Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities.

291
0:16:,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And if you believe that, then you believe that where we are --

292
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:08,000
this is what I think -- I believe that where we are with the incredible kludge --

293
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and I haven't even talked about user interfaces on the Web --

294
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:15,000
but there's so much kludge, so much terrible stuff --

295
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:19,000
we are at the 1908 Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet.

296
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:22,000
That's where we are. We don't get our hair caught in it,

297
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:25,000
but that's the level of primitiveness of where we are.

298
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:27,000
We're in 1908.

299
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:31,000
And if you believe that, then stuff like this doesn't bother you. This is 1996:

300
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:35,000
"All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble."

301
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:41,000
1998: "Amazon.toast." In 1999: "Amazon.bomb."

302
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:43,000
My mom hates this picture.

303
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:46,000
(Laughter)

304
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:5,000
She -- but you know, if you really do believe that it's the very,

305
0:16:5,000 --> 0:16:54,000
very beginning, if you believe it's the 1908 Hurley washing machine,

306
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:57,000
then you're incredibly optimistic. And I do think that that's where we are.

307
0:16:57,000 --> 0:17:,000
And I do think there's more innovation ahead of us

308
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:02,000
than there is behind us.

309
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:06,000
And in 1917, Sears -- I want to get this exactly right.

310
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:11,000
This was the advertisement that they ran in 1917.

311
0:17:11,000 --> 0:17:14,000
It says: "Use your electricity for more than light."

312
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:16,000
And I think that's where we are.

313
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
We're very, very early. Thank you very much.

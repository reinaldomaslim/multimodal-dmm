1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 times.

2
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I'm giving a short slide show this morning

3
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that I'm giving for the very first time, so --

4
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
well it's -- I don't want or need to raise the bar,

5
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I'm actually trying to lower the bar.

6
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Because I've cobbled this together

7
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to try to meet the challenge of this session.

8
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong's fantastic presentation

9
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
that religion really properly understood

10
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
is not about belief, but about behavior.

11
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism.

12
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
How dare we be optimistic?

13
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief, an intellectual posture.

14
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
As Mahatma Gandhi famously said,

15
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
"You must become the change you wish to see in the world."

16
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And the outcome about which

17
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created

18
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
by the belief alone, except to the extent that the belief

19
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
brings about new behavior. But the word "behavior"

20
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
is also, I think, sometimes misunderstood in this context.

21
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I'm a big advocate of changing

22
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the lightbulbs and buying hybrids,

23
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house,

24
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and dug the geothermal wells, and did all of that other stuff.

25
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
But, as important as it is to change the lightbulbs,

26
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
it is more important to change the laws.

27
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And when we change our behavior in our daily lives,

28
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
we sometimes leave out the citizenship part

29
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and the democracy part. In order to be optimistic about this,

30
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy.

31
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
In order to solve the climate crisis,

32
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
we have to solve the democracy crisis.

33
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And we have one.

34
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I have been trying to tell this story for a long time.

35
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I was reminded of that recently, by a woman

36
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
who walked past the table I was sitting at,

37
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
just staring at me as she walked past. She was in her 70s,

38
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
looked like she had a kind face. I thought nothing of it

39
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
until I saw from the corner of my eye

40
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
she was walking from the opposite direction,

41
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
also just staring at me. And so I said, "How do you do?"

42
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And she said, "You know, if you dyed your hair black,

43
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
you would look just like Al Gore." (Laughter)

44
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Many years ago, when I was a young congressman,

45
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge

46
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
of nuclear arms control -- the nuclear arms race.

47
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And the military historians taught me,

48
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
during that quest, that military conflicts are typically

49
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
put into three categories: local battles,

50
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
regional or theater wars, and the rare but all-important

51
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
global, world war -- strategic conflicts.

52
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources,

53
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
a different approach,

54
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
a different organizational model.

55
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Environmental challenges fall into the same three categories,

56
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and most of what we think about

57
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
are local environmental problems: air pollution, water pollution,

58
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
hazardous waste dumps. But there are also

59
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
regional environmental problems, like acid rain

60
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
from the Midwest to the Northeast, and from Western Europe

61
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to the Arctic, and from the Midwest

62
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico.

63
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And there are lots of those. But the climate crisis

64
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is the rare but all-important

65
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
global, or strategic, conflict.

66
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Everything is affected. And we have to organize our response

67
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
appropriately. We need a worldwide, global mobilization

68
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
for renewable energy, conservation, efficiency

69
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and a global transition to a low-carbon economy.

70
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We have work to do. And we can mobilize resources

71
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
and political will. But the political will

72
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
has to be mobilized, in order to mobilize the resources.

73
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Let me show you these slides here.

74
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I thought I would start with the logo. What's missing here,

75
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
of course, is the North Polar ice cap.

76
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Greenland remains. Twenty-eight years ago, this is what the

77
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
polar ice cap -- the North Polar ice cap -- looked like

78
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
at the end of the summer, at the fall equinox.

79
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
This last fall, I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center

80
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
in Boulder, Colorado, and talked to the researchers

81
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory.

82
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
This is what's happened in the last 28 years.

83
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
To put it in perspective, 2005 was the previous record.

84
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Here's what happened last fall

85
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that has really unnerved the researchers.

86
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically --

87
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
doesn't look quite the same size --

88
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
but it is exactly the same size as the United States,

89
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona.

90
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The amount that disappeared in 2005

91
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
was equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi.

92
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
The extra amount that disappeared last fall

93
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
was equivalent to this much. It comes back in the winter,

94
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
but not as permanent ice, as thin ice --

95
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
vulnerable. The amount remaining could be completely gone

96
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
in summer in as little as five years.

97
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland.

98
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Already, around the Arctic Circle --

99
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
this is a famous village in Alaska. This is a town

100
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
in Newfoundland. Antarctica. Latest studies from NASA.

101
0:07:10.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
The amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting

102
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
of an area equivalent to the size of California.

103
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
"They were the best of times,

104
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
they were the worst of times": the most famous opening sentence

105
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
in English literature. I want to share briefly

106
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
a tale of two planets. Earth and Venus

107
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
are exactly the same size. Earth's diameter

108
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
is about 400 kilometers larger, but essentially the same size.

109
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
They have exactly the same amount of carbon.

110
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But the difference is, on Earth, most of the carbon

111
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere,

112
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
deposited in the ground as coal, oil,

113
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
natural gas, etc. On Venus, most of it

114
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
is in the atmosphere. The difference is that our temperature

115
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
is 59 degrees on average. On Venus,

116
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
it's 855. This is relevant to our current strategy

117
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible,

118
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and putting it into the atmosphere.

119
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.

120
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It's three times hotter than Mercury,

121
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
which is right next to the Sun. Now, briefly,

122
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
here's an image you've seen, as one of the only old images,

123
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI: Climate.

124
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
The global scientific community says:

125
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
man-made global warming pollution, put into the atmosphere,

126
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
thickening this, is trapping more of the outgoing infrared.

127
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
You all know that. At the last

128
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
IPCC summary, the scientists wanted to say,

129
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
"How certain are you?" They wanted to answer that "99 percent."

130
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The Chinese objected, and so the compromise was

131
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
"more than 90 percent."

132
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Now, the skeptics say, "Oh, wait a minute,

133
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
this could be variations in this energy

134
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
coming in from the sun." If that were true,

135
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
the stratosphere would be heated as well as the

136
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
lower atmosphere, if it's more coming in.

137
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
If it's more being trapped on the way out, then you would

138
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
expect it to be warmer here and cooler here. Here is the lower atmosphere.

139
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Here's the stratosphere: cooler.

140
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
CSI: Climate.

141
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Now, here's the good news. Sixty-eight percent of Americans now believe

142
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that human activity is responsible

143
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
for global warming. Sixty-nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up

144
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
in a significant way. There has been progress,

145
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
but here is the key: when given a list

146
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
of challenges to confront, global warming is still listed at near the bottom.

147
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
What is missing is a sense of urgency.

148
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
If you agree with the factual analysis,

149
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but you don't feel the sense of urgency,

150
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
where does that leave you?

151
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Well, the Alliance for Climate Protection, which I head

152
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
in conjunction with Current TV -- who did this pro bono --

153
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this.

154
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
This is the winner.

155
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
NBC -- I'll show all of the networks here -- the top journalists

156
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
for NBC asked 956 questions in 2007

157
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
of the presidential candidates: two of them were about

158
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
the climate crisis. ABC: 844 questions, two about the climate crisis.

159
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Fox: two. CNN: two. CBS: zero.

160
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
From laughs to tears -- this is one of the older

161
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
tobacco commercials.

162
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
So here's what we're doing.

163
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries. And us.

164
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
But it's not just the developed nations.

165
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
The developing countries are now following us

166
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and accelerating their pace. And actually,

167
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent

168
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to where we were in 1965. And they're catching up

169
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
very dramatically. The total concentrations:

170
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
by 2025, they will be essentially where we were in 1985.

171
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
If the wealthy countries were completely missing

172
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
from the picture, we would still have this crisis.

173
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
But we have given to the developing countries

174
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
the technologies and the ways of thinking

175
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that are creating the crisis. This is in Bolivia --

176
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
over thirty years.

177
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
This is peak fishing in a few seconds. The '60s.

178
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
'70s. '80s. '90s. We have to stop this. And the good news is that we can.

179
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
We have the technologies.

180
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
We have to have a unified view of how to go about this:

181
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
the struggle against poverty in the world

182
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions,

183
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
all has a single, very simple solution.

184
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
People say, "What's the solution?" Here it is.

185
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Put a price on carbon. We need a CO2 tax, revenue neutral,

186
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
to replace taxation on employment, which was invented by Bismarck --

187
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and some things have changed

188
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
since the 19th century.

189
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
In the poor world, we have to integrate the responses

190
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
to poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis.

191
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Plans to fight poverty in Uganda

192
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
are mooted, if we do not solve the climate crisis.

193
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
But responses can actually make a huge difference

194
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
in the poor countries. This is a proposal

195
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
that has been talked about a lot in Europe.

196
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
This was from Nature magazine. These are concentrating

197
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
solar, renewable energy plants, linked in a so-called "supergrid"

198
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
to supply all of the electrical power

199
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
to Europe, largely from developing countries -- high-voltage DC currents.

200
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
This is not pie in the sky; this can be done.

201
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
We need to do it for our own economy.

202
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
The latest figures show that the old model

203
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
is not working. There are a lot of great investments

204
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
that you can make. If you are investing in tar sands

205
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
or shale oil, then you have a portfolio

206
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
that is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets.

207
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And it is based on an old model.

208
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones

209
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
in their arms and their legs collapse. Developing tar sands

210
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and coal shale is the equivalent. Here are just a few of the investments

211
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
that I personally think make sense.

212
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000
I have a stake in these, so I'll have a disclaimer there.

213
0:15:47.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
But geothermal, concentrating solar,

214
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
advanced photovoltaics, efficiency and conservation.

215
0:15:57.33,000 --> 0:16:,000
You've seen this slide before, but there's a change.

216
0:16:00.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
The only two countries that didn't ratify

217
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
-- and now there's only one. Australia had an election.

218
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And there was a campaign in Australia

219
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
that involved television and Internet and radio commercials

220
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
to lift the sense of urgency for the people there.

221
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And we trained 250 people to give the slide show

222
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
in every town and village and city in Australia.

223
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Lot of other things contributed to it,

224
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
but the new Prime Minister announced that

225
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
his very first priority would be to change Australia's position

226
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
on Kyoto, and he has. Now, they came to an awareness

227
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:46,000
partly because of the horrible drought that they have had.

228
0:16:46.33,000 --> 0:16:5,000
This is Lake Lanier. My friend Heidi Cullen

229
0:16:50.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names,

230
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:57,000
we'd call the one in the southeast now Katrina,

231
0:16:57.33,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and we would say it's headed toward Atlanta.

232
0:16:59.33,000 --> 0:17:03,000
We can't wait for the kind of drought

233
0:17:03.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Australia had to change our political culture.

234
0:17:05.33,000 --> 0:17:14,000
Here's more good news. The cities supporting Kyoto in the U.S.

235
0:17:14.33,000 --> 0:17:17,000
are up to 780 -- and I thought I saw one go by there,

236
0:17:17.33,000 --> 0:17:23,000
just to localize this -- which is good news.

237
0:17:23.33,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Now, to close, we heard a couple of days ago

238
0:17:29.33,000 --> 0:17:38,000
about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace

239
0:17:38.33,000 --> 0:17:41,000
that it becomes banal or routine.

240
0:17:41.33,000 --> 0:17:5,000
What we need is another hero generation. Those of us who are alive

241
0:17:50.33,000 --> 0:17:52,000
in the United States of America

242
0:17:52.33,000 --> 0:17:54,000
today especially, but also the rest of the world,

243
0:17:55.33,000 --> 0:18:,000
have to somehow understand that history

244
0:18:00.33,000 --> 0:18:1,000
has presented us with a choice -- just as Jill [Bolte] Taylor was figuring out

245
0:18:10.33,000 --> 0:18:15,000
how to save her life while she was distracted

246
0:18:15.33,000 --> 0:18:19,000
by the amazing experience that she was going through.

247
0:18:19.33,000 --> 0:18:22,000
We now have a culture of distraction.

248
0:18:22.33,000 --> 0:18:27,000
But we have a planetary emergency.

249
0:18:27.33,000 --> 0:18:31,000
And we have to find a way to create,

250
0:18:31.33,000 --> 0:18:37,000
in the generation of those alive today, a sense of generational mission.

251
0:18:37.33,000 --> 0:18:4,000
I wish I could find the words to convey this.

252
0:18:43.33,000 --> 0:18:45,000
This was another hero generation

253
0:18:45.33,000 --> 0:18:48,000
that brought democracy to the planet.

254
0:18:48.33,000 --> 0:18:55,000
Another that ended slavery. And that gave women the right to vote.

255
0:18:55.33,000 --> 0:19:02,000
We can do this. Don't tell me that we don't have the capacity to do it.

256
0:19:02.33,000 --> 0:19:06,000
If we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq War,

257
0:19:06.33,000 --> 0:19:09,000
we could be well on the way to solving this challenge.

258
0:19:09.33,000 --> 0:19:13,000
We have the capacity to do it.

259
0:19:19.33,000 --> 0:19:32,000
One final point: I'm optimistic, because I believe

260
0:19:32.33,000 --> 0:19:36,000
we have the capacity, at moments of great challenge,

261
0:19:36.33,000 --> 0:19:42,000
to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge

262
0:19:42.33,000 --> 0:19:45,000
that history is presenting to us.

263
0:19:47.33,000 --> 0:19:59,000
Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis

264
0:19:59.33,000 --> 0:20:01,000
by saying, "Oh, this is so terrible.

265
0:20:01.33,000 --> 0:20:07,000
What a burden we have." I would like to ask you

266
0:20:07.33,000 --> 0:20:11,000
to reframe that. How many generations

267
0:20:11.33,000 --> 0:20:16,000
in all of human history have had the opportunity

268
0:20:16.33,000 --> 0:20:25,000
to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts?

269
0:20:25.33,000 --> 0:20:31,000
A challenge that can pull from us

270
0:20:31.33,000 --> 0:20:39,000
more than we knew we could do? I think we ought to approach

271
0:20:39.33,000 --> 0:20:43,000
this challenge with a sense of profound joy

272
0:20:43.33,000 --> 0:20:48,000
and gratitude that we are the generation

273
0:20:48.33,000 --> 0:20:52,000
about which, a thousand years from now,

274
0:20:52.33,000 --> 0:21:01,000
philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate

275
0:21:01.33,000 --> 0:21:08,000
by saying, they were the ones that found it within themselves

276
0:21:08.33,000 --> 0:21:13,000
to solve this crisis and lay the basis

277
0:21:13.33,000 --> 0:21:15,000
for a bright and optimistic human future.

278
0:21:15.33,000 --> 0:21:18,000
Let's do that. Thank you very much.

279
0:21:42.33,000 --> 0:21:48,000
Chris Anderson: For so many people at TED, there is deep pain

280
0:21:48.33,000 --> 0:21:5,000
that basically a design issue

281
0:21:50.33,000 --> 0:21:52,000
on a voting form --

282
0:21:52.33,000 --> 0:21:56,000
one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard

283
0:21:56.33,000 --> 0:21:57,000
like that in the last eight years in a position

284
0:21:57.33,000 --> 0:21:59,000
where you could make these things come true.

285
0:21:59.33,000 --> 0:22:01,000
That hurts.

286
0:22:01.33,000 --> 0:22:08,000
Al Gore: You have no idea. (Laughter)

287
0:22:11.33,000 --> 0:22:12,000
CA: When you look at what the leading candidates

288
0:22:12.33,000 --> 0:22:14,000
in your own party are doing now -- I mean, there's --

289
0:22:14.33,000 --> 0:22:19,000
are you excited by their plans on global warming?

290
0:22:28.33,000 --> 0:22:32,000
AG: The answer to the question is hard for me

291
0:22:32.33,000 --> 0:22:36,000
because, on the one hand, I think that

292
0:22:36.33,000 --> 0:22:4,000
we should feel really great about the fact

293
0:22:41.33,000 --> 0:22:47,000
that the Republican nominee -- certain nominee --

294
0:22:47.33,000 --> 0:22:51,000
John McCain, and both of the finalists

295
0:22:51.33,000 --> 0:22:56,000
for the Democratic nomination -- all three have a very different

296
0:22:56.33,000 --> 0:22:58,000
and forward-leaning position

297
0:22:58.33,000 --> 0:23:03,000
on the climate crisis. All three have offered leadership,

298
0:23:03.33,000 --> 0:23:07,000
and all three are very different from the approach taken

299
0:23:07.33,000 --> 0:23:1,000
by the current administration. And I think

300
0:23:10.33,000 --> 0:23:14,000
that all three have also been responsible in

301
0:23:14.33,000 --> 0:23:25,000
putting forward plans and proposals. But the campaign dialogue that --

302
0:23:25.33,000 --> 0:23:26,000
as illustrated by the questions --

303
0:23:26.33,000 --> 0:23:27,000
that was put together by the

304
0:23:27.33,000 --> 0:23:3,000
League of Conservation Voters, by the way, the analysis of all the questions --

305
0:23:30.33,000 --> 0:23:32,000
and, by the way, the debates have all been

306
0:23:34.33,000 --> 0:23:36,000
sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label,

307
0:23:36.33,000 --> 0:23:4,000
"Clean Coal." Has anybody noticed that?

308
0:23:40.33,000 --> 0:23:44,000
Every single debate has been sponsored by "Clean Coal."

309
0:23:44.33,000 --> 0:23:46,000
"Now, even lower emissions!"

310
0:23:46.33,000 --> 0:23:5,000
The richness and fullness of the dialogue

311
0:23:50.33,000 --> 0:23:53,000
in our democracy has not laid the basis

312
0:23:53.33,000 --> 0:23:57,000
for the kind of bold initiative that is really needed.

313
0:23:57.33,000 --> 0:24:,000
So they're saying the right things and they may --

314
0:24:00.33,000 --> 0:24:03,000
whichever of them is elected -- may do the right thing,

315
0:24:03.33,000 --> 0:24:07,000
but let me tell you: when I came back from Kyoto

316
0:24:07.33,000 --> 0:24:14,000
in 1997, with a feeling of great happiness

317
0:24:14.33,000 --> 0:24:16,000
that we'd gotten that breakthrough there,

318
0:24:16.33,000 --> 0:24:18,000
and then confronted the United States Senate,

319
0:24:18.33,000 --> 0:24:22,000
only one out of 100 senators was willing to vote

320
0:24:22.33,000 --> 0:24:29,000
to confirm, to ratify that treaty. Whatever the candidates say

321
0:24:29.33,000 --> 0:24:34,000
has to be laid alongside what the people say.

322
0:24:34.33,000 --> 0:24:38,000
This challenge is part of the fabric

323
0:24:38.33,000 --> 0:24:4,000
of our whole civilization.

324
0:24:40.33,000 --> 0:24:43,000
CO2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization, literally.

325
0:24:44.33,000 --> 0:24:47,000
And now we mechanized that process. Changing that pattern

326
0:24:47.33,000 --> 0:24:54,000
requires a scope, a scale, a speed of change

327
0:24:54.33,000 --> 0:24:57,000
that is beyond what we have done in the past.

328
0:24:57.33,000 --> 0:24:59,000
So that's why I began by saying,

329
0:24:59.33,000 --> 0:25:05,000
be optimistic in what you do, but be an active citizen.

330
0:25:06.33,000 --> 0:25:08,000
Demand -- change the light bulbs,

331
0:25:08.33,000 --> 0:25:11,000
but change the laws. Change the global treaties.

332
0:25:11.33,000 --> 0:25:17,000
We have to speak up. We have to solve this democracy -- this --

333
0:25:18.33,000 --> 0:25:24,000
We have sclerosis in our democracy. And we have to change that.

334
0:25:25.33,000 --> 0:25:26,000
Use the Internet. Go on the Internet.

335
0:25:26.33,000 --> 0:25:3,000
Connect with people. Become very active as citizens.

336
0:25:30.33,000 --> 0:25:32,000
Have a moratorium -- we shouldn't

337
0:25:32.33,000 --> 0:25:34,000
have any new coal-fired generating plants

338
0:25:34.33,000 --> 0:25:39,000
that aren't able to capture and store CO2, which means we have to

339
0:25:39.33,000 --> 0:25:41,000
quickly build these renewable sources.

340
0:25:41.33,000 --> 0:25:45,000
Now, nobody is talking on that scale. But I do believe

341
0:25:45.33,000 --> 0:25:49,000
that between now and November, it is possible.

342
0:25:49.33,000 --> 0:25:5,000
This Alliance for Climate Protection

343
0:25:51.33,000 --> 0:25:54,000
is going to launch a nationwide campaign --

344
0:25:54.33,000 --> 0:25:57,000
grassroots mobilization, television ads, Internet ads,

345
0:25:57.33,000 --> 0:26:,000
radio, newspaper -- with partnerships with everybody

346
0:26:00.33,000 --> 0:26:03,000
from the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen.

347
0:26:03.33,000 --> 0:26:07,000
We need help. We need help.

348
0:26:07.33,000 --> 0:26:11,000
CA: In terms of your own personal role going forward,

349
0:26:11.33,000 --> 0:26:13,000
Al, is there something more than that

350
0:26:13.33,000 --> 0:26:14,000
you would like to be doing?

351
0:26:14.33,000 --> 0:26:22,000
AG: I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer

352
0:26:22.33,000 --> 0:26:27,000
to that question. What can I do?

353
0:26:27.33,000 --> 0:26:31,000
Buckminster Fuller once wrote, "If the future

354
0:26:31.33,000 --> 0:26:36,000
of all human civilization depended on me, what would I do?

355
0:26:36.33,000 --> 0:26:41,000
How would I be?" It does depend on all of us,

356
0:26:41.33,000 --> 0:26:43,000
but again, not just with the light bulbs.

357
0:26:43.33,000 --> 0:26:51,000
We, most of us here, are Americans. We have a democracy.

358
0:26:51.33,000 --> 0:26:57,000
We can change things, but we have to actively change.

359
0:26:57.33,000 --> 0:27:02,000
What's needed really is a higher level of consciousness.

360
0:27:02.33,000 --> 0:27:04,000
And that's hard to --

361
0:27:04.33,000 --> 0:27:08,000
that's hard to create -- but it is coming.

362
0:27:08.33,000 --> 0:27:11,000
There's an old African proverb that some of you know

363
0:27:11.33,000 --> 0:27:15,000
that says, "If you want to go quickly, go alone;

364
0:27:15.33,000 --> 0:27:23,000
if you want to go far, go together." We have to go far, quickly.

365
0:27:23.33,000 --> 0:27:27,000
So we have to have a change in consciousness.

366
0:27:27.33,000 --> 0:27:31,000
A change in commitment. A new sense of urgency.

367
0:27:31.33,000 --> 0:27:34,000
A new appreciation for the privilege

368
0:27:34.33,000 --> 0:27:37,000
that we have of undertaking this challenge.

369
0:27:37.33,000 --> 0:27:41,000
CA: Al Gore, thank you so much for coming to TED.

370
0:27:41.33,000 --> 0:27:45,000
AG: Thank you. Thank you very much.

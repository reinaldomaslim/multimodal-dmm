1
0:00:16.069,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So the first robot to talk about is called STriDER.

2
0:00:19.267,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It stands for Self-excited Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot.

3
0:00:22.76,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's a robot that has three legs, which is inspired by nature.

4
0:00:27.76,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But have you seen anything in nature, an animal that has three legs?

5
0:00:31.195,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Probably not. So why do I call this a biologically inspired robot?

6
0:00:35.089,000 --> 0:00:36,000
How would it work?

7
0:00:36.275,000 --> 0:00:38,000
But before that, let's look at pop culture.

8
0:00:38.461,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So, you know H.G. Wells's "War of the Worlds," novel and movie.

9
0:00:41.953,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And what you see over here is a very popular video game,

10
0:00:45.298,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and in this fiction, they describe these alien creatures and robots

11
0:00:49.022,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that have three legs that terrorize Earth.

12
0:00:51.308,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But my robot, STriDER, does not move like this.

13
0:00:54.867,000 --> 0:00:57,000
This is an actual dynamic simulation animation.

14
0:00:57.942,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I'm going to show you how the robot works.

15
0:01:00.023,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It flips its body 180 degrees

16
0:01:02.439,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and it swings its leg between the two legs

17
0:01:04.521,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and catches the fall.

18
0:01:05.704,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So that's how it walks.

19
0:01:06.89,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But when you look at us human beings, bipedal walking,

20
0:01:09.626,000 --> 0:01:1,000
what you're doing is,

21
0:01:10.808,000 --> 0:01:14,000
you're not really using muscle to lift your leg and walk like a robot.

22
0:01:14.919,000 --> 0:01:17,000
What you're doing is, you swing your leg and catch the fall,

23
0:01:18.28,000 --> 0:01:2,000
stand up again, swing your leg and catch the fall.

24
0:01:20.76,000 --> 0:01:23,000
You're using your built-in dynamics, the physics of your body,

25
0:01:23.951,000 --> 0:01:24,000
just like a pendulum.

26
0:01:25.726,000 --> 0:01:28,000
We call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion.

27
0:01:29.108,000 --> 0:01:31,000
What you're doing is, when you stand up,

28
0:01:31.27,000 --> 0:01:33,000
potential energy to kinetic energy,

29
0:01:33.375,000 --> 0:01:34,000
potential energy to kinetic energy.

30
0:01:35.376,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It's a constantly falling process.

31
0:01:37.377,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this,

32
0:01:40.45,000 --> 0:01:44,000
really, we're inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking

33
0:01:44.603,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to this robot.

34
0:01:45.784,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Thus, it's a biologically inspired robot.

35
0:01:47.785,000 --> 0:01:49,000
What you see here, this is what we want to do next.

36
0:01:50.222,000 --> 0:01:53,000
We want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-range motion.

37
0:01:53.76,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And it deploys legs -- it looks almost like "Star Wars" --

38
0:01:56.578,000 --> 0:01:58,000
so when it lands, it absorbs the shock and starts walking.

39
0:01:59.466,000 --> 0:02:02,000
What you see over here, this yellow thing, this is not a death ray.

40
0:02:02.695,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:03.731,000 --> 0:02:04,000
This is just to show you

42
0:02:04.914,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that if you have cameras or different types of sensors,

43
0:02:07.625,000 --> 0:02:08,000
because it's 1.8 meters tall,

44
0:02:09.166,000 --> 0:02:12,000
you can see over obstacles like bushes and those kinds of things.

45
0:02:12.276,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So we have two prototypes.

46
0:02:13.647,000 --> 0:02:15,000
The first version, in the back, that's STriDER I.

47
0:02:16.614,000 --> 0:02:18,000
The one in front, the smaller, is STriDER II.

48
0:02:18.805,000 --> 0:02:21,000
The problem we had with STriDER I is, it was just too heavy in the body.

49
0:02:22.337,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We had so many motors aligning the joints

50
0:02:24.945,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and those kinds of things.

51
0:02:26.223,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So we decided to synthesize a mechanical mechanism

52
0:02:29.447,000 --> 0:02:32,000
so we could get rid of all the motors, and with a single motor,

53
0:02:32.54,000 --> 0:02:33,000
we can coordinate all the motions.

54
0:02:34.241,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It's a mechanical solution to a problem, instead of using mechatronics.

55
0:02:37.642,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So with this, now the top body is lighted up; it's walking in our lab.

56
0:02:41.078,000 --> 0:02:43,000
This was the very first successful step.

57
0:02:43.161,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It's still not perfected, its coffee falls down,

58
0:02:45.853,000 --> 0:02:46,000
so we still have a lot of work to do.

59
0:02:48.685,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The second robot I want to talk about is called IMPASS.

60
0:02:51.405,000 --> 0:02:55,000
It stands for Intelligent Mobility Platform with Actuated Spoke System.

61
0:02:55.888,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It's a wheel-leg hybrid robot.

62
0:02:58.507,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So think of a rimless wheel or a spoke wheel,

63
0:03:02.388,000 --> 0:03:04,000
but the spokes individually move in and out of the hub;

64
0:03:05.389,000 --> 0:03:07,000
so, it's a wheel-leg hybrid.

65
0:03:07.5,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We're literally reinventing the wheel here.

66
0:03:09.766,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Let me demonstrate how it works.

67
0:03:12.253,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So in this video we're using an approach called the reactive approach.

68
0:03:16.126,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Just simply using the tactile sensors on the feet,

69
0:03:19.127,000 --> 0:03:21,000
it's trying to walk over a changing terrain,

70
0:03:21.961,000 --> 0:03:23,000
a soft terrain where it pushes down and changes.

71
0:03:24.685,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And just by the tactile information,

72
0:03:26.906,000 --> 0:03:28,000
it successfully crosses over these types of terrains.

73
0:03:29.685,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But, when it encounters a very extreme terrain --

74
0:03:33.514,000 --> 0:03:36,000
in this case, this obstacle is more than three times the height

75
0:03:37.451,000 --> 0:03:38,000
of the robot --

76
0:03:38.645,000 --> 0:03:39,000
then it switches to a deliberate mode,

77
0:03:40.543,000 --> 0:03:42,000
where it uses a laser range finder and camera systems

78
0:03:43.381,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to identify the obstacle and the size.

79
0:03:45.231,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And it carefully plans the motion of the spokes

80
0:03:48.239,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and coordinates it so it can show this very impressive mobility.

81
0:03:51.972,000 --> 0:03:53,000
You probably haven't seen anything like this out there.

82
0:03:54.637,000 --> 0:03:57,000
This is a very high-mobility robot that we developed called IMPASS.

83
0:03:59.873,000 --> 0:04:,000
Ah, isn't that cool?

84
0:04:01.685,000 --> 0:04:04,000
When you drive your car,

85
0:04:05.003,000 --> 0:04:08,000
when you steer your car, you use a method called Ackermann steering.

86
0:04:08.949,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The front wheels rotate like this.

87
0:04:10.824,000 --> 0:04:12,000
For most small-wheeled robots,

88
0:04:13.363,000 --> 0:04:15,000
they use a method called differential steering

89
0:04:15.636,000 --> 0:04:17,000
where the left and right wheel turn the opposite direction.

90
0:04:18.517,000 --> 0:04:2,000
For IMPASS, we can do many, many different types of motion.

91
0:04:21.439,000 --> 0:04:22,000
For example, in this case,

92
0:04:22.732,000 --> 0:04:24,000
even though the left and right wheels are connected

93
0:04:25.156,000 --> 0:04:27,000
with a single axle rotating at the same angle of velocity,

94
0:04:27.946,000 --> 0:04:3,000
we simply change the length of the spoke, it affects the diameter,

95
0:04:31.104,000 --> 0:04:33,000
then can turn to the left and to the right.

96
0:04:33.215,000 --> 0:04:36,000
These are just some examples of the neat things we can do with IMPASS.

97
0:04:36.592,000 --> 0:04:37,000
This robot is called CLIMBeR:

98
0:04:38.39,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Cable-suspended Limbed Intelligent Matching Behavior Robot.

99
0:04:41.814,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I've been talking to a lot of NASA JPL scientists --

100
0:04:44.965,000 --> 0:04:46,000
at JPL, they are famous for the Mars rovers --

101
0:04:47.139,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and the scientists, geologists always tell me

102
0:04:49.534,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that the real interesting science, the science-rich sites,

103
0:04:52.685,000 --> 0:04:53,000
are always at the cliffs.

104
0:04:54.22,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But the current rovers cannot get there.

105
0:04:56.194,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So, inspired by that, we wanted to build a robot

106
0:04:58.701,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that can climb a structured cliff environment.

107
0:05:01.842,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So this is CLIMBeR.

108
0:05:03.09,000 --> 0:05:04,000
It has three legs.

109
0:05:04.625,000 --> 0:05:07,000
It's probably difficult to see, but it has a winch and a cable at the top.

110
0:05:08.232,000 --> 0:05:1,000
It tries to figure out the best place to put its foot.

111
0:05:10.837,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And then once it figures that out,

112
0:05:12.496,000 --> 0:05:14,000
in real time, it calculates the force distribution:

113
0:05:15.497,000 --> 0:05:17,000
how much force it needs to exert to the surface

114
0:05:18.044,000 --> 0:05:19,000
so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip.

115
0:05:20.045,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Once it stabilizes that, it lifts a foot,

116
0:05:22.21,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and then with the winch, it can climb up these kinds of cliffs.

117
0:05:26.045,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Also for search and rescue applications as well.

118
0:05:28.685,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Five years ago, I actually worked at NASA JPL

119
0:05:31.128,000 --> 0:05:32,000
during the summer as a faculty fellow.

120
0:05:33.002,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And they already had a six-legged robot called LEMUR.

121
0:05:36.476,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So this is actually based on that.

122
0:05:38.14,000 --> 0:05:39,000
This robot is called MARS:

123
0:05:39.455,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Multi-Appendage Robotic System.

124
0:05:41.096,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It's a hexapod robot.

125
0:05:42.358,000 --> 0:05:43,000
We developed our adaptive gait planner.

126
0:05:44.359,000 --> 0:05:46,000
We actually have a very interesting payload on there.

127
0:05:46.908,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The students like to have fun.

128
0:05:48.379,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And here you can see that it's walking over unstructured terrain.

129
0:05:51.498,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Motor sound)

130
0:05:52.639,000 --> 0:05:54,000
It's trying to walk on the coastal terrain, a sandy area,

131
0:05:55.46,000 --> 0:05:59,000
but depending on the moisture content or the grain size of the sand,

132
0:06:00.132,000 --> 0:06:03,000
the foot's soil sinkage model changes, so it tries to adapt its gait

133
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to successfully cross over these kind of things.

134
0:06:06.264,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It also does some fun stuff.

135
0:06:07.795,000 --> 0:06:1,000
As you can imagine, we get so many visitors visiting our lab.

136
0:06:11.304,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So when the visitors come, MARS walks up to the computer,

137
0:06:14.06,000 --> 0:06:16,000
starts typing, "Hello, my name is MARS.

138
0:06:16.132,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Welcome to RoMeLa,

139
0:06:17.685,000 --> 0:06:19,000
the Robotics Mechanisms Laboratory at Virginia Tech."

140
0:06:20.322,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Laughter)

141
0:06:21.816,000 --> 0:06:23,000
This robot is an amoeba robot.

142
0:06:23.965,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Now, we don't have enough time to go into technical details,

143
0:06:26.877,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I'll just show you some of the experiments.

144
0:06:28.958,000 --> 0:06:3,000
These are some of the early feasibility experiments.

145
0:06:31.494,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We store potential energy to the elastic skin to make it move,

146
0:06:34.603,000 --> 0:06:37,000
or use active tension cords to make it move forward and backward.

147
0:06:38.43,000 --> 0:06:39,000
It's called ChIMERA.

148
0:06:39.611,000 --> 0:06:42,000
We also have been working with some scientists and engineers

149
0:06:42.647,000 --> 0:06:43,000
from UPenn

150
0:06:43.822,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to come up with a chemically actuated version of this amoeba robot.

151
0:06:47.679,000 --> 0:06:48,000
We do something to something,

152
0:06:49.586,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and just like magic, it moves.

153
0:06:52.886,000 --> 0:06:53,000
"The Blob."

154
0:06:55.193,000 --> 0:06:56,000
This robot is a very recent project.

155
0:06:56.994,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It's called RAPHaEL:

156
0:06:58.169,000 --> 0:07:,000
Robotic Air-Powered Hand with Elastic Ligaments.

157
0:07:00.88,000 --> 0:07:02,000
There are a lot of really neat, very good robotic hands

158
0:07:03.903,000 --> 0:07:04,000
out there on the market.

159
0:07:05.09,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The problem is, they're just too expensive --

160
0:07:07.294,000 --> 0:07:08,000
tens of thousands of dollars.

161
0:07:08.723,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So for prosthesis applications it's probably not too practical,

162
0:07:11.768,000 --> 0:07:12,000
because it's not affordable.

163
0:07:13.137,000 --> 0:07:16,000
We wanted to tackle this problem in a very different direction.

164
0:07:16.635,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Instead of using electrical motors, electromechanical actuators,

165
0:07:19.708,000 --> 0:07:2,000
we're using compressed air.

166
0:07:21.488,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We developed these novel actuators for the joints, so it's compliant.

167
0:07:24.959,000 --> 0:07:25,000
You can actually change the force,

168
0:07:26.685,000 --> 0:07:27,000
simply just changing the air pressure.

169
0:07:28.535,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And it can actually crush an empty soda can.

170
0:07:30.749,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It can pick up very delicate objects like a raw egg,

171
0:07:33.823,000 --> 0:07:34,000
or in this case, a lightbulb.

172
0:07:36.05,000 --> 0:07:39,000
The best part: it took only 200 dollars to make the first prototype.

173
0:07:41.166,000 --> 0:07:43,000
This robot is actually a family of snake robots

174
0:07:43.938,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that we call HyDRAS,

175
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Hyper Degrees-of-freedom Robotic Articulated Serpentine.

176
0:07:48.065,000 --> 0:07:5,000
This is a robot that can climb structures.

177
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
This is a HyDRAS's arm.

178
0:07:52.367,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It's a 12-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm.

179
0:07:54.4,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But the cool part is the user interface.

180
0:07:56.772,000 --> 0:07:58,000
The cable over there, that's an optical fiber.

181
0:07:59.539,000 --> 0:08:01,000
This student, it's probably her first time using it,

182
0:08:01.999,000 --> 0:08:03,000
but she can articulate it in many different ways.

183
0:08:04.38,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So, for example, in Iraq, the war zone, there are roadside bombs.

184
0:08:07.867,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Currently, you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed.

185
0:08:11.902,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It takes really a lot of time and it's expensive to train the operator

186
0:08:15.465,000 --> 0:08:16,000
to operate this complex arm.

187
0:08:17.227,000 --> 0:08:18,000
In this case, it's very intuitive;

188
0:08:19.218,000 --> 0:08:21,000
this student, probably his first time using it,

189
0:08:21.51,000 --> 0:08:22,000
is doing very complex manipulation tasks,

190
0:08:23.512,000 --> 0:08:26,000
picking up objects and doing manipulation, just like that.

191
0:08:26.897,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Very intuitive.

192
0:08:30.025,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Now, this robot is currently our star robot.

193
0:08:32.646,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We actually have a fan club for the robot, DARwIn:

194
0:08:35.655,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Dynamic Anthropomorphic Robot with Intelligence.

195
0:08:38.58,000 --> 0:08:41,000
As you know, we're very interested in human walking,

196
0:08:42.487,000 --> 0:08:44,000
so we decided to build a small humanoid robot.

197
0:08:44.703,000 --> 0:08:45,000
This was in 2004; at that time,

198
0:08:46.489,000 --> 0:08:48,000
this was something really, really revolutionary.

199
0:08:48.783,000 --> 0:08:49,000
This was more of a feasibility study:

200
0:08:50.608,000 --> 0:08:52,000
What kind of motors should we use? Is it even possible?

201
0:08:53.283,000 --> 0:08:54,000
What kinds of controls should we do?

202
0:08:55.041,000 --> 0:08:58,000
This does not have any sensors, so it's an open-loop control.

203
0:08:58.585,000 --> 0:09:,000
For those who probably know, if you don't have any sensors

204
0:09:01.379,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and there's any disturbances, you know what happens.

205
0:09:03.976,000 --> 0:09:05,000
(Laughter)

206
0:09:06.113,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Based on that success, the following year we did the proper mechanical design,

207
0:09:11.361,000 --> 0:09:12,000
starting from kinematics.

208
0:09:12.609,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And thus, DARwIn I was born in 2005.

209
0:09:15.543,000 --> 0:09:17,000
It stands up, it walks -- very impressive.

210
0:09:17.878,000 --> 0:09:2,000
However, still, as you can see, it has a cord, an umbilical cord.

211
0:09:21.259,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So we're still using an external power source

212
0:09:23.455,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and external computation.

213
0:09:26.002,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So in 2006, now it's really time to have fun.

214
0:09:29.337,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Let's give it intelligence.

215
0:09:30.82,000 --> 0:09:32,000
We give it all the computing power it needs:

216
0:09:32.965,000 --> 0:09:34,000
a 1.5 gigahertz Pentium M chip, two FireWire cameras,

217
0:09:35.519,000 --> 0:09:37,000
rate gyros, accelerometers, four forced sensors on the foot,

218
0:09:38.389,000 --> 0:09:39,000
lithium polymer batteries --

219
0:09:39.763,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and now DARwIn II is completely autonomous.

220
0:09:43.406,000 --> 0:09:45,000
It is not remote controlled. There's no tethers.

221
0:09:46.121,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It looks around, searches for the ball ... looks around, searches for the ball,

222
0:09:49.878,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and it tries to play a game of soccer autonomously -- artificial intelligence.

223
0:09:54.831,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Let's see how it does.

224
0:09:56.009,000 --> 0:09:57,000
This was our very first trial, and ...

225
0:09:57.98,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Video) Spectators: Goal!

226
0:10:03.498,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Dennis Hong: There is actually a competition called RoboCup.

227
0:10:06.472,000 --> 0:10:08,000
I don't know how many of you have heard about RoboCup.

228
0:10:09.083,000 --> 0:10:13,000
It's an international autonomous robot soccer competition.

229
0:10:13.481,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And the actual goal of RoboCup is,

230
0:10:16.253,000 --> 0:10:18,000
by the year 2050,

231
0:10:18.47,000 --> 0:10:21,000
we want to have full-size, autonomous humanoid robots

232
0:10:22.225,000 --> 0:10:25,000
play soccer against the human World Cup champions

233
0:10:25.323,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and win.

234
0:10:26.5,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Laughter)

235
0:10:27.556,000 --> 0:10:28,000
It's a true, actual goal.

236
0:10:28.798,000 --> 0:10:31,000
It's a very ambitious goal, but we truly believe we can do it.

237
0:10:32.719,000 --> 0:10:33,000
This is last year in China.

238
0:10:34.477,000 --> 0:10:37,000
We were the very first team in the United States that qualified

239
0:10:37.514,000 --> 0:10:38,000
in the humanoid RoboCup competition.

240
0:10:39.338,000 --> 0:10:41,000
This is this year in Austria.

241
0:10:41.542,000 --> 0:10:43,000
You're going to see the action is three against three,

242
0:10:44.133,000 --> 0:10:45,000
completely autonomous.

243
0:10:45.348,000 --> 0:10:46,000
(Video) (Crowd groans)

244
0:10:46.463,000 --> 0:10:47,000
DH: There you go. Yes!

245
0:10:48.591,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The robots track and they team-play amongst themselves.

246
0:10:53.194,000 --> 0:10:54,000
It's very impressive.

247
0:10:54.369,000 --> 0:10:55,000
It's really a research event,

248
0:10:55.869,000 --> 0:10:59,000
packaged in a more exciting competition event.

249
0:11:00.133,000 --> 0:11:03,000
What you see here is the beautiful Louis Vuitton Cup trophy.

250
0:11:03.685,000 --> 0:11:04,000
This is for the best humanoid.

251
0:11:05.228,000 --> 0:11:08,000
We'd like to bring this, for the first time, to the United States next year,

252
0:11:08.921,000 --> 0:11:09,000
so wish us luck.

253
0:11:10.1,000 --> 0:11:11,000
(Applause)

254
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Thank you.

255
0:11:12.336,000 --> 0:11:14,000
(Applause)

256
0:11:14.441,000 --> 0:11:16,000
DARwIn also has a lot of other talents.

257
0:11:16.533,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Last year, it actually conducted the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra

258
0:11:20.273,000 --> 0:11:22,000
for the holiday concert.

259
0:11:22.685,000 --> 0:11:24,000
This is the next generation robot, DARwIn IV,

260
0:11:25.685,000 --> 0:11:27,000
much smarter, faster, stronger.

261
0:11:28.685,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And it's trying to show off its ability:

262
0:11:30.686,000 --> 0:11:31,000
"I'm macho, I'm strong."

263
0:11:32.507,000 --> 0:11:33,000
(Laughter)

264
0:11:33.975,000 --> 0:11:37,000
"I can also do some Jackie Chan-motion, martial art movements."

265
0:11:38.224,000 --> 0:11:4,000
(Laughter)

266
0:11:41.685,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And it walks away. So this is DARwIn IV.

267
0:11:43.644,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Again, you'll be able to see it in the lobby.

268
0:11:45.803,000 --> 0:11:48,000
We truly believe this will be the very first running humanoid robot

269
0:11:49.019,000 --> 0:11:5,000
in the United States.

270
0:11:50.194,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So stay tuned.

271
0:11:51.372,000 --> 0:11:54,000
All right. So I showed you some of our exciting robots at work.

272
0:11:54.397,000 --> 0:11:56,000
So, what is the secret of our success?

273
0:11:56.609,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Where do we come up with these ideas?

274
0:11:58.45,000 --> 0:11:59,000
How do we develop these kinds of ideas?

275
0:12:00.367,000 --> 0:12:01,000
We have a fully autonomous vehicle

276
0:12:02.181,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that can drive into urban environments.

277
0:12:04.081,000 --> 0:12:06,000
We won a half a million dollars in the DARPA Urban Challenge.

278
0:12:07.004,000 --> 0:12:1,000
We also have the world's very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind.

279
0:12:10.685,000 --> 0:12:12,000
We call it the Blind Driver Challenge, very exciting.

280
0:12:13.233,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And many, many other robotics projects I want to talk about.

281
0:12:16.429,000 --> 0:12:18,000
These are just the awards that we won in 2007 fall

282
0:12:19.09,000 --> 0:12:21,000
from robotics competitions and those kinds of things.

283
0:12:21.685,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So really, we have five secrets.

284
0:12:23.602,000 --> 0:12:25,000
First is: Where do we get inspiration?

285
0:12:26.062,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Where do we get this spark of imagination?

286
0:12:28.165,000 --> 0:12:3,000
This is a true story, my personal story.

287
0:12:30.21,000 --> 0:12:32,000
At night, when I go to bed, at three, four in the morning,

288
0:12:33.011,000 --> 0:12:35,000
I lie down, close my eyes, and I see these lines and circles

289
0:12:35.924,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and different shapes floating around.

290
0:12:37.742,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And they assemble, and they form these kinds of mechanisms.

291
0:12:40.529,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And I think, "Ah, this is cool."

292
0:12:42.161,000 --> 0:12:44,000
So right next to my bed I keep a notebook, a journal,

293
0:12:45.062,000 --> 0:12:47,000
with a special pen that has an LED light on it,

294
0:12:47.442,000 --> 0:12:5,000
because I don't want to turn on the light and wake up my wife.

295
0:12:50.503,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So I see this, scribble everything down, draw things, and go to bed.

296
0:12:53.796,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Every day in the morning, the first thing I do,

297
0:12:56.21,000 --> 0:12:58,000
before my first cup of coffee, before I brush my teeth,

298
0:12:58.841,000 --> 0:12:59,000
I open my notebook.

299
0:13:00.027,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Many times it's empty; sometimes I have something there.

300
0:13:02.714,000 --> 0:13:04,000
If something's there, sometimes it's junk.

301
0:13:04.804,000 --> 0:13:06,000
But most of the time, I can't read my handwriting.

302
0:13:07.185,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Four in the morning -- what do you expect, right?

303
0:13:09.533,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So I need to decipher what I wrote.

304
0:13:11.461,000 --> 0:13:14,000
But sometimes I see this ingenious idea in there,

305
0:13:14.685,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and I have this eureka moment.

306
0:13:16.194,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I directly run to my home office, sit at my computer,

307
0:13:18.734,000 --> 0:13:19,000
I type in the ideas, I sketch things out

308
0:13:20.735,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and I keep a database of ideas.

309
0:13:23.288,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So when we have these calls for proposals,

310
0:13:25.673,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I try to find a match between my potential ideas

311
0:13:29.267,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and the problem.

312
0:13:30.451,000 --> 0:13:32,000
If there's a match, we write a research proposal,

313
0:13:32.792,000 --> 0:13:33,000
get the research funding in,

314
0:13:34.163,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and that's how we start our research programs.

315
0:13:36.347,000 --> 0:13:38,000
But just a spark of imagination is not good enough.

316
0:13:38.864,000 --> 0:13:39,000
How do we develop these kinds of ideas?

317
0:13:40.768,000 --> 0:13:42,000
At our lab RoMeLa, the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory,

318
0:13:43.572,000 --> 0:13:45,000
we have these fantastic brainstorming sessions.

319
0:13:46.208,000 --> 0:13:5,000
So we gather around, we discuss problems and solutions and talk about it.

320
0:13:50.567,000 --> 0:13:52,000
But before we start, we set this golden rule.

321
0:13:53.568,000 --> 0:13:54,000
The rule is:

322
0:13:55.241,000 --> 0:13:57,000
nobody criticizes anybody's ideas.

323
0:13:58.242,000 --> 0:14:,000
Nobody criticizes any opinion.

324
0:14:00.685,000 --> 0:14:03,000
This is important, because many times, students fear or feel uncomfortable

325
0:14:04.256,000 --> 0:14:07,000
about how others might think about their opinions and thoughts.

326
0:14:07.549,000 --> 0:14:1,000
So once you do this, it is amazing how the students open up.

327
0:14:11.363,000 --> 0:14:14,000
They have these wacky, cool, crazy, brilliant ideas,

328
0:14:14.685,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and the whole room is just electrified with creative energy.

329
0:14:18.138,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And this is how we develop our ideas.

330
0:14:20.998,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Well, we're running out of time.

331
0:14:22.579,000 --> 0:14:23,000
One more thing I want to talk about is,

332
0:14:24.505,000 --> 0:14:27,000
you know, just a spark of idea and development is not good enough.

333
0:14:27.685,000 --> 0:14:31,000
There was a great TED moment -- I think it was Sir Ken Robinson, was it?

334
0:14:32.42,000 --> 0:14:36,000
He gave a talk about how education and school kill creativity.

335
0:14:36.882,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Well, actually, there's two sides to the story.

336
0:14:39.685,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So there is only so much one can do with just ingenious ideas

337
0:14:44.922,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and creativity and good engineering intuition.

338
0:14:47.962,000 --> 0:14:48,000
If you want to go beyond a tinkering,

339
0:14:49.78,000 --> 0:14:51,000
if you want to go beyond a hobby of robotics

340
0:14:51.954,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and really tackle the grand challenges of robotics

341
0:14:55.419,000 --> 0:14:56,000
through rigorous research,

342
0:14:56.685,000 --> 0:14:57,000
we need more than that.

343
0:14:57.864,000 --> 0:14:59,000
This is where school comes in.

344
0:14:59.902,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Batman, fighting against the bad guys,

345
0:15:02.42,000 --> 0:15:04,000
he has his utility belt, he has his grappling hook,

346
0:15:04.837,000 --> 0:15:05,000
he has all different kinds of gadgets.

347
0:15:06.685,000 --> 0:15:08,000
For us roboticists, engineers and scientists,

348
0:15:09.122,000 --> 0:15:13,000
these tools are the courses and classes you take in class.

349
0:15:13.303,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Math, differential equations.

350
0:15:15.329,000 --> 0:15:17,000
I have linear algebra, science, physics --

351
0:15:18.093,000 --> 0:15:2,000
even, nowadays, chemistry and biology, as you've seen.

352
0:15:21.085,000 --> 0:15:22,000
These are all the tools we need.

353
0:15:22.867,000 --> 0:15:23,000
So the more tools you have, for Batman,

354
0:15:24.767,000 --> 0:15:25,000
more effective at fighting the bad guys,

355
0:15:26.768,000 --> 0:15:28,000
for us, more tools to attack these kinds of big problems.

356
0:15:30.842,000 --> 0:15:31,000
So education is very important.

357
0:15:33.828,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Also -- it's not only about that.

358
0:15:36.449,000 --> 0:15:38,000
You also have to work really, really hard.

359
0:15:38.541,000 --> 0:15:39,000
So I always tell my students,

360
0:15:40.018,000 --> 0:15:42,000
"Work smart, then work hard."

361
0:15:42.093,000 --> 0:15:44,000
This picture in the back -- this is three in the morning.

362
0:15:44.841,000 --> 0:15:46,000
I guarantee if you come to our lab at 3, 4am,

363
0:15:47.194,000 --> 0:15:48,000
we have students working there,

364
0:15:48.774,000 --> 0:15:51,000
not because I tell them to, but because we are having too much fun.

365
0:15:52.007,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Which leads to the last topic:

366
0:15:53.685,000 --> 0:15:54,000
do not forget to have fun.

367
0:15:55.578,000 --> 0:15:58,000
That's really the secret of our success, we're having too much fun.

368
0:15:58.815,000 --> 0:16:01,000
I truly believe that highest productivity comes when you're having fun,

369
0:16:02.305,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and that's what we're doing.

370
0:16:03.685,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And there you go.

371
0:16:04.863,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Thank you so much.

372
0:16:06.054,000 --> 0:16:1,000
(Applause)

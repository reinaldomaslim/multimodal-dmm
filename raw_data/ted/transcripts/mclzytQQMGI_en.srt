1
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you so much, Prime Minister,

2
0:00:28.735,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that was both fascinating and quite inspiring.

3
0:00:30.95,000 --> 0:00:32,000
So, you're calling for a global ethic.

4
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Would you describe that as global citizenship?

5
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Is that an idea that you believe in, and how would you define that?

6
0:00:41.545,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Gordon Brown: It is about global citizenship

7
0:00:43.695,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and recognizing our responsibilities to others.

8
0:00:45.916,000 --> 0:00:48,000
There is so much to do over the next few years

9
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that is obvious to so many of us

10
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to build a better world.

11
0:00:54.506,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And there is so much shared sense of what we need to do,

12
0:00:58.896,000 --> 0:01:,000
that it is vital that we all come together.

13
0:01:00.926,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But we don't necessarily have the means to do so.

14
0:01:03.652,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So there are challenges to be met.

15
0:01:05.89,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I believe the concept of global citizenship

16
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents.

17
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But of course the task is to create the institutions

18
0:01:14.788,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that make that global society work.

19
0:01:16.748,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But I don't think we should underestimate

20
0:01:18.733,000 --> 0:01:2,000
the extent to which massive changes in technology

21
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
make possible the linking up of people across the world.

22
0:01:24.539,000 --> 0:01:27,000
CA: But people get excited about this idea of global citizenship,

23
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but then they get confused a bit again

24
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
when they start thinking about patriotism,

25
0:01:32.354,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and how to combine these two.

26
0:01:34.092,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I mean, you're elected as Prime Minister

27
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
with a brief to bat for Britain.

28
0:01:39.646,000 --> 0:01:42,000
How do you reconcile the two things?

29
0:01:43.251,000 --> 0:01:45,000
GB: Well, of course national identity remains important.

30
0:01:46.252,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But it's not at the expense of people accepting their global responsibilities.

31
0:01:49.992,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And I think one of the problems of recession

32
0:01:53.07,000 --> 0:01:56,000
is that people become more protectionist,

33
0:01:56.197,000 --> 0:01:57,000
they look in on themselves,

34
0:01:58.006,000 --> 0:02:,000
they try to protect their own nation,

35
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
perhaps at the expense of other nations.

36
0:02:03.602,000 --> 0:02:05,000
When you actually look at the motor of the world economy,

37
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
it cannot move forward

38
0:02:08.091,000 --> 0:02:1,000
unless there is trade between the different countries.

39
0:02:11.01,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And any nation that would become protectionist over the next few years

40
0:02:14.549,000 --> 0:02:16,000
would deprive itself of the chance of getting the benefits

41
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
of growth in the world economy.

42
0:02:19.43,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So, you've got to have a healthy sense of patriotism;

43
0:02:22.692,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that's absolutely important.

44
0:02:24.096,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But you've got to realize that this world has changed fundamentally,

45
0:02:27.406,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and the problems we have cannot be solved by one nation and one nation alone.

46
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
CA: Well, indeed.

47
0:02:32.491,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But what do you do when the two come into conflict

48
0:02:35.83,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and you're forced to make a decision

49
0:02:37.855,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that either is in Britain's interest, or the interest of Britons,

50
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
or citizens elsewhere in the world?

51
0:02:44.713,000 --> 0:02:46,000
GB: Well I think we can persuade people

52
0:02:46.74,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that what is necessary for Britain's long-term interests,

53
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
what is necessary for America's long-term interests,

54
0:02:52.783,000 --> 0:02:54,000
is proper engagement with the rest of the world,

55
0:02:55.093,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and taking the action that is necessary.

56
0:03:00.024,000 --> 0:03:04,000
There is a great story, again, told about Richard Nixon.

57
0:03:04.821,000 --> 0:03:07,000
1958, Ghana becomes independent,

58
0:03:08.796,000 --> 0:03:09,000
so it is just over 50 years ago.

59
0:03:11.203,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Richard Nixon goes to represent the United States government

60
0:03:15.218,000 --> 0:03:17,000
at the celebrations for independence in Ghana.

61
0:03:18.661,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And it's one of his first outings as Vice President to an African country.

62
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
He doesn't quite know what to do,

63
0:03:24.994,000 --> 0:03:25,000
so he starts going around the crowd

64
0:03:26.767,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and starts talking to people

65
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and he says to people in this rather unique way,

66
0:03:30.64,000 --> 0:03:32,000
"How does it feel to be free?"

67
0:03:32.881,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And he's going around, "How does it feel to be free?"

68
0:03:35.627,000 --> 0:03:36,000
"How does it feel to be free?"

69
0:03:37.238,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And then someone says,

70
0:03:38.364,000 --> 0:03:4,000
"How should I know? I come from Alabama."

71
0:03:40.535,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And that was the 1950s.

73
0:03:46.758,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Now, what is remarkable

74
0:03:51.052,000 --> 0:03:54,000
is that civil rights in America were achieved in the 1960s.

75
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
But what is equally remarkable

76
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
is socioeconomic rights in Africa have not moved forward very fast

77
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
even since the age of colonialism.

78
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And yet, America and Africa have got a common interest.

79
0:04:09.56,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And we have got to realize that if we don't link up

80
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
with those people who are sensible voices and democratic voices in Africa,

81
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to work together for common causes,

82
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
then the danger of Al Qaeda and related groups

83
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
making progress in Africa is very big.

84
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So, I would say that what seems sometimes

85
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to be altruism, in relation to Africa, or in relation to developing countries,

86
0:04:30.172,000 --> 0:04:31,000
is more than that.

87
0:04:31.345,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It is enlightened self-interest for us to work with other countries.

88
0:04:34.663,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And I would say that national interest

89
0:04:36.537,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and, if you like, what is the global interest

90
0:04:38.67,000 --> 0:04:4,000
to tackle poverty and climate change

91
0:04:40.774,000 --> 0:04:42,000
do, in the long run, come together.

92
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And whatever the short-run price for taking action on climate change

93
0:04:46.593,000 --> 0:04:48,000
or on security, or taking action to provide opportunities

94
0:04:49.3,000 --> 0:04:5,000
for people for education,

95
0:04:50.589,000 --> 0:04:52,000
these are prices that are worth paying

96
0:04:52.815,000 --> 0:04:54,000
so that you build a stronger global society

97
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
where people feel able to feel comfortable with each other

98
0:04:58.739,000 --> 0:05:,000
and are able to communicate with each other in such a way

99
0:05:01.445,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that you can actually build stronger links between different countries.

100
0:05:04.81,000 --> 0:05:06,000
CA: I still just want to draw out on this issue.

101
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So, you're on vacation at a nice beach,

102
0:05:10.751,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and word comes through that there's been a massive earthquake

103
0:05:13.982,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and that there is a tsunami advancing on the beach.

104
0:05:16.426,000 --> 0:05:2,000
One end of the beach, there is a house containing a family of five Nigerians.

105
0:05:21.207,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And at the other end of the beach there is a single Brit.

106
0:05:24.487,000 --> 0:05:25,000
You have time to --

107
0:05:25.892,000 --> 0:05:26,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:27.837,000 --> 0:05:29,000
you have time to alert one house.

109
0:05:30.195,000 --> 0:05:31,000
What do you do?

110
0:05:31.22,000 --> 0:05:33,000
(Laughter)

111
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
GB: Modern communications.

112
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Applause)

113
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Alert both.

114
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Applause)

115
0:05:43.79,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I do agree that my responsibility

116
0:05:47.259,000 --> 0:05:5,000
is first of all to make sure that people in our country are safe.

117
0:05:50.45,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And I wouldn't like anything that is said today to suggest

118
0:05:53.784,000 --> 0:05:55,000
that I am diminishing the importance of the responsibility

119
0:05:56.537,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that each leader has for their own country.

120
0:05:58.957,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But I'm trying to suggest that there is a huge opportunity

121
0:06:02.133,000 --> 0:06:04,000
open to us that was never open to us before.

122
0:06:04.45,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But the power to communicate across borders

123
0:06:06.522,000 --> 0:06:09,000
allows us to organize the world in a different way.

124
0:06:10.282,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And I think, look at the tsunami, it's a classic example.

125
0:06:13.878,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Where was the early warning systems?

126
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Where was the world acting together

127
0:06:19.14,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to deal with the problems that they knew arose

128
0:06:21.399,000 --> 0:06:23,000
from the potential for earthquakes,

129
0:06:23.856,000 --> 0:06:25,000
as well as the potential for climate change?

130
0:06:25.977,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And when the world starts to work together,

131
0:06:28.05,000 --> 0:06:29,000
with better early-warning systems,

132
0:06:29.763,000 --> 0:06:31,000
you can deal with some of these problems in a better way.

133
0:06:32.469,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I just think we're not seeing, at the moment,

134
0:06:34.616,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the huge opportunities open to us by the ability of people to cooperate

135
0:06:38.57,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in a world where either there was isolationism before

136
0:06:41.571,000 --> 0:06:44,000
or there was limited alliances based on convenience

137
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
which never actually took you to deal with some of the central problems.

138
0:06:48.82,000 --> 0:06:49,000
CA: But I think this is the frustration

139
0:06:50.822,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that perhaps a lot of people have, like people in the audience here,

140
0:06:54.066,000 --> 0:06:56,000
where we love the kind of language that you're talking about.

141
0:06:56.979,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It is inspiring.

142
0:06:58.012,000 --> 0:07:01,000
A lot of us believe that that has to be the world's future.

143
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And yet, when the situation changes,

144
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
you suddenly hear politicians talking as if,

145
0:07:07.136,000 --> 0:07:1,000
you know, for example, the life of one American soldier

146
0:07:10.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
is worth countless numbers of Iraqi civilians.

147
0:07:13.01,000 --> 0:07:16,000
When the pedal hits the metal,

148
0:07:16.589,000 --> 0:07:18,000
the idealism can get moved away.

149
0:07:19.956,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I'm just wondering whether you can see that changing over time,

150
0:07:25.45,000 --> 0:07:26,000
whether you see in Britain

151
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that there are changing attitudes,

152
0:07:29.014,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and that people are actually more supportive

153
0:07:31.167,000 --> 0:07:33,000
of the kind of global ethic that you talk about.

154
0:07:34.761,000 --> 0:07:36,000
GB: I think every religion, every faith,

155
0:07:37.634,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and I'm not just talking here to people of faith or religion --

156
0:07:40.763,000 --> 0:07:43,000
it has this global ethic at the center of its credo.

157
0:07:44.78,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And whether it's Jewish or whether it's Muslim

158
0:07:48.137,000 --> 0:07:5,000
or whether it's Hindu, or whether it's Sikh,

159
0:07:50.994,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the same global ethic is at the heart of each of these religions.

160
0:07:56.013,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So, I think you're dealing with something

161
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that people instinctively see as part of their moral sense.

162
0:08:03.145,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So you're building on something that is not pure self-interest.

163
0:08:06.931,000 --> 0:08:09,000
You're building on people's ideas and values --

164
0:08:10.932,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that perhaps they're candles that burn very dimly on certain occasions.

165
0:08:17.06,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But it is a set of values that cannot, in my view, be extinguished.

166
0:08:21.232,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Then the question is,

167
0:08:22.811,000 --> 0:08:24,000
how do you make that change happen?

168
0:08:25.493,000 --> 0:08:28,000
How do you persuade people that it is in their interest

169
0:08:29.405,000 --> 0:08:3,000
to build strong --

170
0:08:31.168,000 --> 0:08:32,000
After the Second World War,

171
0:08:32.696,000 --> 0:08:34,000
we built institutions, the United Nations,

172
0:08:35.697,000 --> 0:08:36,000
the IMF, the World Bank,

173
0:08:37.084,000 --> 0:08:39,000
the World Trade Organization, the Marshall Plan.

174
0:08:39.942,000 --> 0:08:43,000
There was a period in which people talked about an act of creation,

175
0:08:43.999,000 --> 0:08:44,000
because these institutions were so new.

176
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But they are now out of date. They don't deal with the problems.

177
0:08:49.135,000 --> 0:08:51,000
You can't deal with the environmental problem

178
0:08:51.294,000 --> 0:08:52,000
through existing institutions.

179
0:08:52.793,000 --> 0:08:55,000
You can't deal with the security problem in the way that you need to.

180
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
You can't deal with the economic and financial problem.

181
0:08:58.926,000 --> 0:09:,000
So we have got to rebuild our global institutions,

182
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
build them in a way that is suitable to the challenges of this time.

183
0:09:04.573,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And I believe that if you look at the biggest challenge we face,

184
0:09:07.665,000 --> 0:09:09,000
it is to persuade people to have the confidence

185
0:09:10.331,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that we can build a truly global society

186
0:09:12.836,000 --> 0:09:15,000
with the institutions that are founded on these rules.

187
0:09:15.94,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So, I come back to my initial point.

188
0:09:18.281,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Sometimes you think things are impossible.

189
0:09:20.306,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Nobody would have said 50 years ago

190
0:09:22.283,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that apartheid would have gone in 1990,

191
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
or that the Berlin wall would have fallen at the turn of the '80s and '90s,

192
0:09:28.753,000 --> 0:09:29,000
or that polio could be eradicated,

193
0:09:30.551,000 --> 0:09:31,000
or perhaps 60 years ago,

194
0:09:32.016,000 --> 0:09:34,000
nobody would have said a man could gone to the Moon.

195
0:09:34.508,000 --> 0:09:35,000
All these things have happened.

196
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
By tackling the impossible, you make the impossible possible.

197
0:09:39.746,000 --> 0:09:42,000
CA: And we have had a speaker who said that very thing,

198
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and swallowed a sword right after that, which was quite dramatic.

199
0:09:46.773,000 --> 0:09:47,000
(Laughter)

200
0:09:47.93,000 --> 0:09:49,000
GB: Followed my sword and swallow.

201
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
CA: But, surely a true global ethic is for someone to say,

202
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
"I believe that the life of every human on the planet

203
0:09:58.016,000 --> 0:10:,000
is worth the same, equal consideration,

204
0:10:01.017,000 --> 0:10:04,000
regardless of nationality and religion."

205
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And you have politicians who have --

206
0:10:07.331,000 --> 0:10:08,000
you're elected.

207
0:10:08.408,000 --> 0:10:09,000
In a way, you can't say that.

208
0:10:09.847,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Even if, as a human being, you believe that,

209
0:10:11.957,000 --> 0:10:12,000
you can't say that.

210
0:10:13.35,000 --> 0:10:15,000
You're elected for Britain's interests.

211
0:10:15.726,000 --> 0:10:17,000
GB: We have a responsibility to protect.

212
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I mean look, 1918, the Treaty of Versailles,

213
0:10:21.63,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and all the treaties before that,

214
0:10:23.466,000 --> 0:10:25,000
the Treaty of Westphalia and everything else,

215
0:10:25.617,000 --> 0:10:27,000
were about protecting the sovereign right of countries

216
0:10:28.261,000 --> 0:10:29,000
to do what they want.

217
0:10:29.604,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Since then, the world has moved forward,

218
0:10:31.88,000 --> 0:10:33,000
partly as a result of what happened with the Holocaust,

219
0:10:34.881,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and people's concern about the rights of individuals

220
0:10:37.752,000 --> 0:10:4,000
within territories where they need protection,

221
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
partly because of what we saw in Rwanda,

222
0:10:44.155,000 --> 0:10:45,000
partly because of what we saw in Bosnia.

223
0:10:46.156,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The idea of the responsibility to protect

224
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
all individuals who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk

225
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
is now being established as a principle which governs the world.

226
0:10:55.402,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So, while I can't automatically say

227
0:10:59.045,000 --> 0:11:05,000
that Britain will rush to the aid of any citizen of any country, in danger,

228
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I can say that Britain is in a position

229
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
where we're working with other countries

230
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
so that this idea that you have a responsibility

231
0:11:12.64,000 --> 0:11:17,000
to protect people who are victims of either genocide or humanitarian attack,

232
0:11:17.942,000 --> 0:11:19,000
is something that is accepted by the whole world.

233
0:11:20.291,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Now, in the end, that can only be achieved

234
0:11:22.316,000 --> 0:11:25,000
if your international institutions work well enough to be able to do so.

235
0:11:25.918,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And that comes back to what the future role of the United Nations,

236
0:11:29.086,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and what it can do, actually is.

237
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But, the responsibility to protect is a new idea that is, in a sense,

238
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
taken over from the idea of self-determination

239
0:11:37.986,000 --> 0:11:39,000
as the principle governing the international community.

240
0:11:40.757,000 --> 0:11:42,000
CA: Can you picture, in our lifetimes,

241
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
a politician ever going out on a platform

242
0:11:46.774,000 --> 0:11:5,000
of the kind of full-form global ethic, global citizenship?

243
0:11:51.948,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And basically saying, "I believe that all people across the planet

244
0:11:56.64,000 --> 0:11:57,000
have equal consideration,

245
0:11:58.115,000 --> 0:12:,000
and if in power we will act in that way.

246
0:12:01.021,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And we believe that the people of this country

247
0:12:03.322,000 --> 0:12:05,000
are also now global citizens and will support that ethic."

248
0:12:06.323,000 --> 0:12:09,000
GB: Is that not what we're doing in the debate about climate change?

249
0:12:10.232,000 --> 0:12:12,000
We're saying that you cannot solve

250
0:12:13.002,000 --> 0:12:15,000
the problem of climate change in one country;

251
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
you've got to involve all countries.

252
0:12:17.177,000 --> 0:12:21,000
You're saying that you must, and you have a duty to help those countries

253
0:12:21.772,000 --> 0:12:24,000
that cannot afford to deal with the problems of climate change themselves.

254
0:12:25.468,000 --> 0:12:26,000
You're saying you want a deal

255
0:12:27.429,000 --> 0:12:29,000
with all the different countries of the world

256
0:12:29.564,000 --> 0:12:3,000
where we're all bound together

257
0:12:31.2,000 --> 0:12:35,000
to cutting carbon emissions in a way that is to the benefit of the whole world.

258
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
We've never had this before because Kyoto didn't work.

259
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
If you could get a deal at Copenhagen, where people agreed,

260
0:12:43.215,000 --> 0:12:46,000
A, that there was a long-term target for carbon emission cuts,

261
0:12:46.45,000 --> 0:12:48,000
B, that there was short-range targets that had to be met

262
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
so this wasn't just abstract;

263
0:12:51.141,000 --> 0:12:53,000
it was people actually making decisions now

264
0:12:53.402,000 --> 0:12:54,000
that would make a difference now,

265
0:12:55.19,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and if you could then find a financing mechanism

266
0:12:57.593,000 --> 0:12:59,000
that meant that the poorest countries that had been hurt

267
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
by our inability to deal with climate change

268
0:13:02.45,000 --> 0:13:03,000
over many, many years and decades

269
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
are given special help

270
0:13:06.236,000 --> 0:13:09,000
so that they can move to energy-efficient technologies,

271
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and they are in a position financially

272
0:13:12.148,000 --> 0:13:14,000
to be able to afford the long-term investment

273
0:13:14.497,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that is associated with cutting carbon emissions,

274
0:13:16.934,000 --> 0:13:19,000
then you are treating the world equally,

275
0:13:20.573,000 --> 0:13:23,000
by giving consideration to every part of the planet

276
0:13:24.049,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and the needs they have.

277
0:13:25.7,000 --> 0:13:27,000
It doesn't mean that everybody does exactly the same thing,

278
0:13:28.661,000 --> 0:13:3,000
because we've actually got to do more financially

279
0:13:30.993,000 --> 0:13:31,000
to help the poorest countries,

280
0:13:32.461,000 --> 0:13:34,000
but it does mean there is equal consideration

281
0:13:35.228,000 --> 0:13:38,000
for the needs of citizens in a single planet.

282
0:13:38.711,000 --> 0:13:39,000
CA: Yes.

283
0:13:39.75,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And then of course the theory is still that those talks get rent apart

284
0:13:43.239,000 --> 0:13:46,000
by different countries fighting over their own individual interests.

285
0:13:46.497,000 --> 0:13:48,000
GB: Yes, but I think Europe has got a position,

286
0:13:49.206,000 --> 0:13:52,000
which is 27 countries have already come together.

287
0:13:52.335,000 --> 0:13:53,000
I mean, the great difficulty in Europe

288
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
is if you're at a meeting and 27 people speak,

289
0:13:56.563,000 --> 0:13:57,000
it takes a very, very long time.

290
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
But we did get an agreement on climate change.

291
0:14:02.151,000 --> 0:14:05,000
America has made its first disposition on this

292
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
with the bill that President Obama should be congratulated

293
0:14:09.172,000 --> 0:14:1,000
for getting through Congress.

294
0:14:10.704,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Japan has made an announcement.

295
0:14:12.909,000 --> 0:14:15,000
China and India have signed up to the scientific evidence.

296
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And now we've got to move them to accept

297
0:14:19.198,000 --> 0:14:21,000
a long-term target, and then short-term targets.

298
0:14:21.87,000 --> 0:14:24,000
But more progress has been made, I think, in the last few weeks

299
0:14:24.953,000 --> 0:14:25,000
than had been made for some years.

300
0:14:26.677,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And I do believe that there is a strong possibility

301
0:14:29.981,000 --> 0:14:32,000
that if we work together, we can get that agreement to Copenhagen.

302
0:14:33.497,000 --> 0:14:35,000
I certainly have been putting forward proposals

303
0:14:35.76,000 --> 0:14:37,000
that would have allowed the poorest parts of the world

304
0:14:38.593,000 --> 0:14:42,000
to feel that we have taken into account their specific needs.

305
0:14:42.66,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And we would help them adapt.

306
0:14:44.661,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And we would help them make the transition to a low-carbon economy.

307
0:14:48.402,000 --> 0:14:51,000
I do think a reform of the international institutions is vital to this.

308
0:14:52.188,000 --> 0:14:54,000
When the IMF was created in the 1940s,

309
0:14:54.513,000 --> 0:14:57,000
it was created with resources that were five percent or so of the world's GDP.

310
0:14:58.205,000 --> 0:15:,000
The IMF now has limited resources, one percent.

311
0:15:00.539,000 --> 0:15:01,000
It can't really make the difference

312
0:15:02.262,000 --> 0:15:04,000
that ought to be made in a period of crisis.

313
0:15:04.435,000 --> 0:15:06,000
So, we've got to rebuild the world institutions.

314
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And that's a big task:

315
0:15:08.922,000 --> 0:15:09,000
persuading all the different countries

316
0:15:10.776,000 --> 0:15:13,000
with the different voting shares in these institutions to do so.

317
0:15:13.845,000 --> 0:15:16,000
There is a story told about the three world leaders

318
0:15:17.053,000 --> 0:15:21,000
of the day getting a chance to get some advice from God.

319
0:15:21.711,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And the story is told that Bill Clinton went to God

320
0:15:25.734,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and he asked when there will be successful climate change

321
0:15:30.924,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and a low-carbon economy.

322
0:15:32.497,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And God shook his head and said,

323
0:15:34.108,000 --> 0:15:38,000
"Not this year, not this decade, perhaps not even in [your] lifetime."

324
0:15:38.251,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And Bill Clinton walked away in tears

325
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
because he had failed to get what he wanted.

326
0:15:43.45,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And then the story is that Barroso, the president of the European Commission,

327
0:15:47.099,000 --> 0:15:48,000
went to God and he asked,

328
0:15:48.58,000 --> 0:15:52,000
"When will we get a recovery of global growth?"

329
0:15:52.949,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And God said, "Not this year, not in this decade,

330
0:15:55.308,000 --> 0:15:56,000
perhaps not in your lifetime."

331
0:15:56.951,000 --> 0:15:58,000
So Barroso walked away crying and in tears.

332
0:16:00.707,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And then the Secretary-General of the United Nations

333
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
came up to speak to God and said,

334
0:16:07.818,000 --> 0:16:09,000
"When will our international institutions work?"

335
0:16:11.06,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And God cried.

336
0:16:12.277,000 --> 0:16:15,000
(Laughter)

337
0:16:16.059,000 --> 0:16:22,000
It is very important to recognize that this reform of institutions

338
0:16:22.729,000 --> 0:16:26,000
is the next stage after agreeing upon ourselves

339
0:16:26.753,000 --> 0:16:28,000
that there is a clear ethic upon which we can build.

340
0:16:29.964,000 --> 0:16:31,000
CA: Prime Minister, I think there are many in the audience

341
0:16:32.719,000 --> 0:16:34,000
who are truly appreciative of the efforts you made

342
0:16:35.105,000 --> 0:16:37,000
in terms of the financial mess we got ourselves into.

343
0:16:37.63,000 --> 0:16:39,000
And there are certainly many people in the audience

344
0:16:40.283,000 --> 0:16:43,000
who will be cheering you on as you seek to advance this global ethic.

345
0:16:43.591,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Thank you so much for coming to TED.

346
0:16:45.546,000 --> 0:16:46,000
GB: Well, thank you.

347
0:16:46.879,000 --> 0:16:49,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.934,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies.

2
0:00:16.268,000 --> 0:00:17,000
They're exactly what they sound like.

3
0:00:18.101,000 --> 0:00:2,000
They are these huge collections of galaxies,

4
0:00:20.654,000 --> 0:00:22,000
bound together by their mutual gravity.

5
0:00:22.909,000 --> 0:00:24,000
So most of the points that you see on the screen

6
0:00:25.571,000 --> 0:00:27,000
are not individual stars,

7
0:00:28.1,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but collections of stars, or galaxies.

8
0:00:30.936,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Now, by showing you some of these images,

9
0:00:33.267,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I hope that you will quickly see that

10
0:00:35.014,000 --> 0:00:37,000
galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects,

11
0:00:37.694,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but more than that,

12
0:00:39.187,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I think galaxy clusters are mysterious,

13
0:00:41.85,000 --> 0:00:42,000
they are surprising,

14
0:00:43.403,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and they're useful.

15
0:00:44.82,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories.

16
0:00:48.351,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters

17
0:00:51.987,000 --> 0:00:52,000
is to describe the experiments

18
0:00:53.852,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that you can do with them.

19
0:00:55.405,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And I think there are four major types,

20
0:00:57.685,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and the first type that I want to describe

21
0:01:00.269,000 --> 0:01:02,000
is probing the very big.

22
0:01:02.488,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So, how big?

23
0:01:04.183,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster.

24
0:01:08.434,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It is so massive that the light passing through it

25
0:01:11.403,000 --> 0:01:13,000
is being bent, it's being distorted

26
0:01:14.018,000 --> 0:01:16,000
by the extreme gravity of this cluster.

27
0:01:16.527,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And, in fact, if you look very carefully

28
0:01:18.331,000 --> 0:01:2,000
you'll be able to see rings around this cluster.

29
0:01:21.031,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Now, to give you a number,

30
0:01:22.58,000 --> 0:01:23,000
this particular galaxy cluster

31
0:01:24.363,000 --> 0:01:28,000
has a mass of over one million billion suns.

32
0:01:28.571,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It's just mind-boggling how massive these systems can get.

33
0:01:31.884,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But more than their mass,

34
0:01:33.385,000 --> 0:01:34,000
they have this additional feature.

35
0:01:35.359,000 --> 0:01:37,000
They are essentially isolated systems,

36
0:01:37.703,000 --> 0:01:39,000
so if we like, we can think of them

37
0:01:39.925,000 --> 0:01:42,000
as a scaled-down version of the entire universe.

38
0:01:43.195,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And many of the questions that we might have

39
0:01:45.197,000 --> 0:01:46,000
about the universe at large scales,

40
0:01:47.165,000 --> 0:01:48,000
such as, how does gravity work?

41
0:01:49.08,000 --> 0:01:52,000
might be answered by studying these systems.

42
0:01:52.112,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So that was very big.

43
0:01:53.445,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The second things is very hot.

44
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster,

45
0:01:58.113,000 --> 0:02:,000
and I subtract away all of the starlight,

46
0:02:01.03,000 --> 0:02:03,000
what I'm left with is this big, blue blob.

47
0:02:03.825,000 --> 0:02:04,000
This is in false color.

48
0:02:05.31,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It's actually X-ray light that we're seeing.

49
0:02:07.659,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And the question is, if it's not galaxies,

50
0:02:10.32,000 --> 0:02:12,000
what is emitting this light?

51
0:02:12.519,000 --> 0:02:13,000
The answer is hot gas,

52
0:02:14.419,000 --> 0:02:15,000
million-degree gas --

53
0:02:16.242,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in fact, it's plasma.

54
0:02:17.899,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And the reason why it's so hot

55
0:02:19.558,000 --> 0:02:2,000
goes back to the previous slide.

56
0:02:21.538,000 --> 0:02:23,000
The extreme gravity of these systems

57
0:02:24.278,000 --> 0:02:27,000
is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds,

58
0:02:27.32,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and great speeds means great temperatures.

59
0:02:29.902,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So this is the main idea,

60
0:02:31.621,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but science is a rough draft.

61
0:02:33.987,000 --> 0:02:35,000
There are many basic properties about this plasma

62
0:02:36.538,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that still confuse us,

63
0:02:38.236,000 --> 0:02:39,000
still puzzle us,

64
0:02:39.569,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and still push our understanding

65
0:02:41.655,000 --> 0:02:43,000
of the physics of the very hot.

66
0:02:43.694,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Third thing: probing the very small.

67
0:02:47.121,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Now, to explain this, I need to tell you

68
0:02:49.967,000 --> 0:02:51,000
a very disturbing fact.

69
0:02:51.987,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Most of the universe's matter

70
0:02:54.777,000 --> 0:02:55,000
is not made up of atoms.

71
0:02:56.588,000 --> 0:02:57,000
You were lied to.

72
0:02:58.538,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Most of it is made up of something very, very mysterious,

73
0:03:01.665,000 --> 0:03:03,000
which we call dark matter.

74
0:03:03.787,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Dark matter is something that doesn't like to interact very much,

75
0:03:07.454,000 --> 0:03:08,000
except through gravity,

76
0:03:09.122,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and of course we would like to learn more about it.

77
0:03:10.734,000 --> 0:03:11,000
If you're a particle physicist,

78
0:03:12.277,000 --> 0:03:14,000
you want to know what happens when we smash things together.

79
0:03:14.786,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And dark matter is no exception.

80
0:03:16.776,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Well, how do we do this?

81
0:03:18.436,000 --> 0:03:19,000
To answer that question,

82
0:03:19.927,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I'm going to have to ask another one,

83
0:03:21.32,000 --> 0:03:24,000
which is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide?

84
0:03:24.486,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Here is an image.

85
0:03:26.796,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Since galaxy clusters are representative

86
0:03:29.987,000 --> 0:03:32,000
slices of the universe, scaled-down versions.

87
0:03:33.111,000 --> 0:03:35,000
They are mostly made up of dark matter,

88
0:03:35.234,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and that's what you see in this bluish purple.

89
0:03:37.787,000 --> 0:03:38,000
The red represents the hot gas,

90
0:03:39.404,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and, of course, you can see many galaxies.

91
0:03:41.371,000 --> 0:03:43,000
What's happened is a particle accelerator

92
0:03:43.736,000 --> 0:03:44,000
at a huge, huge scale.

93
0:03:45.627,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And this is very important,

94
0:03:47.404,000 --> 0:03:48,000
because what it means is that very, very small

95
0:03:49.287,000 --> 0:03:52,000
effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab,

96
0:03:52.371,000 --> 0:03:54,000
might be compounded and compounded

97
0:03:54.55,000 --> 0:03:57,000
into something that we could possibly observe in nature.

98
0:03:58.359,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So, it's very funny.

99
0:03:59.871,000 --> 0:04:,000
The reason why galaxy clusters

100
0:04:01.819,000 --> 0:04:02,000
can teach us about dark matter,

101
0:04:03.485,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the reason why galaxy clusters

102
0:04:05.235,000 --> 0:04:07,000
can teach us about the physics of the very small,

103
0:04:07.788,000 --> 0:04:1,000
is precisely because they are so very big.

104
0:04:10.819,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange.

105
0:04:14.904,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Certainly what I've said so far is crazy.

106
0:04:17.954,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Okay, if there's anything stranger

107
0:04:20.237,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I think it has to be dark energy.

108
0:04:22.654,000 --> 0:04:23,000
If I throw a ball into the air,

109
0:04:24.371,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I expect it to go up.

110
0:04:26.169,000 --> 0:04:28,000
What I don't expect is that it go up

111
0:04:28.293,000 --> 0:04:3,000
at an ever-increasing rate.

112
0:04:30.459,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Similarly, cosmologists understand why

113
0:04:33.204,000 --> 0:04:34,000
the universe is expanding.

114
0:04:34.786,000 --> 0:04:36,000
They don't understand why it's expanding

115
0:04:36.954,000 --> 0:04:37,000
at an ever-increasing rate.

116
0:04:38.892,000 --> 0:04:39,000
They give the cause of this

117
0:04:40.57,000 --> 0:04:41,000
accelerated expansion a name,

118
0:04:42.162,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and they call it dark energy.

119
0:04:44.046,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And, again, we want to learn more about it.

120
0:04:46.734,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So, one particular question that we have is,

121
0:04:49.121,000 --> 0:04:51,000
how does dark energy affect the universe

122
0:04:51.816,000 --> 0:04:52,000
at the largest scales?

123
0:04:53.434,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Depending on how strong it is,

124
0:04:54.893,000 --> 0:04:57,000
maybe structure forms faster or slower.

125
0:04:58.154,000 --> 0:05:,000
Well, the problem with the large-scale structure

126
0:05:00.703,000 --> 0:05:02,000
of the universe is that it's horribly complicated.

127
0:05:03.041,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Here is a computer simulation.

128
0:05:05.37,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And we need a way to simplify it.

129
0:05:07.498,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Well, I like to think about this using an analogy.

130
0:05:11.069,000 --> 0:05:13,000
If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic,

131
0:05:13.787,000 --> 0:05:14,000
the most important thing to do

132
0:05:15.453,000 --> 0:05:16,000
is not to model the little positions

133
0:05:17.234,000 --> 0:05:19,000
of every single little piece of the boat that broke off.

134
0:05:20.155,000 --> 0:05:21,000
The most important thing to do is

135
0:05:21.82,000 --> 0:05:23,000
to track the two biggest parts.

136
0:05:23.821,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Similarly, I can learn a lot about the universe

137
0:05:27.653,000 --> 0:05:28,000
at the largest scales

138
0:05:29.12,000 --> 0:05:3,000
by tracking its biggest pieces

139
0:05:30.871,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies.

140
0:05:34.862,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So, as I come to a close,

141
0:05:37.818,000 --> 0:05:39,000
you might feel slightly cheated.

142
0:05:39.82,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I mean, I began by talking about

143
0:05:42.07,000 --> 0:05:44,000
how galaxy clusters are useful,

144
0:05:44.153,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and I've given some reasons,

145
0:05:45.653,000 --> 0:05:47,000
but what is their use really?

146
0:05:48.253,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Well, to answer this,

147
0:05:50.37,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford

148
0:05:52.986,000 --> 0:05:53,000
when he was asked about cars.

149
0:05:54.472,000 --> 0:05:55,000
He had this to say:

150
0:05:55.831,000 --> 0:05:57,000
"If I had asked people what they wanted,

151
0:05:58.12,000 --> 0:06:,000
they would have said faster horses."

152
0:06:00.903,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Today, we as a society are faced

153
0:06:03.404,000 --> 0:06:05,000
with many, many difficult problems.

154
0:06:05.622,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And the solutions to these problems are not obvious.

155
0:06:09.453,000 --> 0:06:11,000
They are not faster horses.

156
0:06:11.62,000 --> 0:06:13,000
They will require an enormous amount of

157
0:06:13.862,000 --> 0:06:14,000
scientific ingenuity.

158
0:06:15.568,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So, yes, we need to focus,

159
0:06:17.154,000 --> 0:06:18,000
yes, we need to concentrate,

160
0:06:18.904,000 --> 0:06:19,000
but we also need to remember that

161
0:06:20.87,000 --> 0:06:22,000
innovation, ingenuity, inspiration --

162
0:06:23.705,000 --> 0:06:24,000
these things come

163
0:06:25.037,000 --> 0:06:26,000
when we broaden our field of vision

164
0:06:26.725,000 --> 0:06:27,000
when we step back

165
0:06:28.065,000 --> 0:06:29,000
when we zoom out.

166
0:06:29.414,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And I can't think of a better way to do this than

167
0:06:31.237,000 --> 0:06:34,000
by studying the universe around us. Thanks.

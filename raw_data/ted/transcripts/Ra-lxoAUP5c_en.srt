0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
My journey to become a polar specialist,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
photographing, specializing in the polar regions,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
began when I was four years old,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
when my family moved from southern Canada

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
to Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland.

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
There we lived with the Inuit

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people,

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
where [we] were one of three non-Inuit families.

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And in this community, we didn't have a television;

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
we didn't have computers, obviously, radio.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We didn't even have a telephone.

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
All of my time was spent outside

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
with the Inuit, playing.

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
The snow and the ice were my sandbox,

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and the Inuit were my teachers.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And that's where I became

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
truly obsessed with this polar realm.

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And I knew someday that I was going to do something

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
that had to do with trying to share news about it

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and protect it.

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I'd like to share with you, for just two minutes only,

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
some images, a cross-section of my work,

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile, "Have You Ever."

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before,

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
but they're allowing me to show you a few images

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet.

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
National Geographic doesn't do this,

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you.

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And what these images are --

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
you'll see them at the start of the slide show -- there's only about four images --

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest.

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
It's pure white, but it's not a polar bear.

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
There are only 200 of these bears left.

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
They're more rare than the panda bear.

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one.

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I thought, my career's over.

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic.

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
What in the heck was I thinking?

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So I had two months to sit there

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life,

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
after I was a photographer, because they were going to fire me.

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time:

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
they publish pictures, not excuses.

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And after two months of sitting there --

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
one day, thinking that it was all over,

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
this incredible big white male came down,

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
right beside me, three feet away from me,

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it.

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
of walking around with this bear through the forest.

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
He went through this old-growth forest

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep.

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him,

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
just in the forest, and photograph him.

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images

58
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and a cross-section of my work that I've done on the polar regions.

59
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Please enjoy.

60
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Music)

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000

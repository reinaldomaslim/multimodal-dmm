1
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I was thinking about my place in the universe,

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and about my first thought about what infinity might mean,

3
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
when I was a child.

4
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And I thought that if time could reach

5
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
forwards and backwards infinitely,

6
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
doesn't that mean that

7
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
every point in time is really infinitely small,

8
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and therefore somewhat meaningless.

9
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So we don't really have a place in the universe,

10
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
as far as on a time line.

11
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
But nothing else does either.

12
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Therefore every moment really is the most important moment

13
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that's ever happened, including this moment right now.

14
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And so therefore this music you're about to hear

15
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
is maybe the most important music

16
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
you'll ever hear in your life.

17
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Applause)

19
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
(Applause)

20
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Thank you.

21
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Applause)

22
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
(Applause)

23
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
For those of you who I'll be fortunate enough to meet afterwards,

24
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
you could please refrain from saying,

25
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
"Oh my god, you're so much shorter in real life."

26
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Laughter)

27
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Because it's like the stage is an optical illusion,

28
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
for some reason.

29
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
(Laughter)

30
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Somewhat like the curving of the universe.

31
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I don't know what it is. I get asked in interviews a lot,

32
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
"My god, you're guitars are so gigantic!"

33
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Laughter)

34
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
"You must get them custom made -- special, humongous guitars."

35
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
(Laughter)

36
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
(Applause)

37
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Thank you very much.

38
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
(Applause)

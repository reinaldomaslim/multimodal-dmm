1
0:00:12.645,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So in college,

2
0:00:15.349,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I was a government major,

3
0:00:16.937,000 --> 0:00:18,000
which means I had to write a lot of papers.

4
0:00:19.423,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Now, when a normal student writes a paper,

5
0:00:21.495,000 --> 0:00:23,000
they might spread the work out a little like this.

6
0:00:23.892,000 --> 0:00:24,000
So, you know --

7
0:00:25.067,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:26.748,000 --> 0:00:27,000
you get started maybe a little slowly,

9
0:00:28.599,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but you get enough done in the first week

10
0:00:30.591,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that, with some heavier days later on,

11
0:00:32.446,000 --> 0:00:34,000
everything gets done, things stay civil.

12
0:00:34.627,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:35.853,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And I would want to do that like that.

14
0:00:38.148,000 --> 0:00:39,000
That would be the plan.

15
0:00:39.366,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I would have it all ready to go,

16
0:00:41.88,000 --> 0:00:43,000
but then, actually, the paper would come along,

17
0:00:44.398,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and then I would kind of do this.

18
0:00:46.363,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Laughter)

19
0:00:48.757,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And that would happen every single paper.

20
0:00:51.638,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But then came my 90-page senior thesis,

21
0:00:55.544,000 --> 0:00:57,000
a paper you're supposed to spend a year on.

22
0:00:57.855,000 --> 0:01:,000
And I knew for a paper like that, my normal work flow was not an option.

23
0:01:01.498,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It was way too big a project.

24
0:01:02.923,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So I planned things out,

25
0:01:04.1,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and I decided I kind of had to go something like this.

26
0:01:07.781,000 --> 0:01:08,000
This is how the year would go.

27
0:01:09.257,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So I'd start off light,

28
0:01:11.248,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and I'd bump it up in the middle months,

29
0:01:13.59,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear

30
0:01:16.24,000 --> 0:01:17,000
just like a little staircase.

31
0:01:17.703,000 --> 0:01:19,000
How hard could it be to walk up the stairs?

32
0:01:20.233,000 --> 0:01:21,000
No big deal, right?

33
0:01:23.09,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But then, the funniest thing happened.

34
0:01:24.924,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Those first few months?

35
0:01:26.791,000 --> 0:01:27,000
They came and went,

36
0:01:27.982,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and I couldn't quite do stuff.

37
0:01:29.591,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So we had an awesome new revised plan.

38
0:01:31.464,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Laughter)

39
0:01:32.655,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And then --

40
0:01:33.838,000 --> 0:01:34,000
(Laughter)

41
0:01:35.744,000 --> 0:01:37,000
But then those middle months actually went by,

42
0:01:38.552,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and I didn't really write words,

43
0:01:40.758,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and so we were here.

44
0:01:43.5,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And then two months turned into one month,

45
0:01:46.1,000 --> 0:01:47,000
which turned into two weeks.

46
0:01:47.749,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And one day I woke up

47
0:01:49.724,000 --> 0:01:51,000
with three days until the deadline,

48
0:01:53.502,000 --> 0:01:54,000
still not having written a word,

49
0:01:55.457,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and so I did the only thing I could:

50
0:01:57.54,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours,

51
0:02:00.171,000 --> 0:02:02,000
pulling not one but two all-nighters --

52
0:02:02.471,000 --> 0:02:04,000
humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters --

53
0:02:06.373,000 --> 0:02:07,000
sprinted across campus,

54
0:02:08.39,000 --> 0:02:09,000
dove in slow motion,

55
0:02:09.9,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and got it in just at the deadline.

56
0:02:11.98,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I thought that was the end of everything.

57
0:02:14.028,000 --> 0:02:15,000
But a week later I get a call,

58
0:02:15.611,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and it's the school.

59
0:02:17.757,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And they say, "Is this Tim Urban?"

60
0:02:19.42,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And I say, "Yeah."

61
0:02:20.912,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And they say, "We need to talk about your thesis."

62
0:02:23.276,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And I say, "OK."

63
0:02:25.468,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And they say,

64
0:02:27.23,000 --> 0:02:28,000
"It's the best one we've ever seen."

65
0:02:29.15,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Laughter)

66
0:02:32.014,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Applause)

67
0:02:36.945,000 --> 0:02:37,000
That did not happen.

68
0:02:38.271,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

69
0:02:40.433,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It was a very, very bad thesis.

70
0:02:43.08,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Laughter)

71
0:02:45.378,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought,

72
0:02:49.502,000 --> 0:02:5,000
"This guy is amazing!"

73
0:02:51.431,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Laughter)

74
0:02:52.803,000 --> 0:02:53,000
No, no, it was very, very bad.

75
0:02:55.343,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy.

76
0:02:58.775,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I write the blog Wait But Why.

77
0:03:00.542,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.

78
0:03:04.302,000 --> 0:03:07,000
My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me,

79
0:03:07.61,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world

80
0:03:11.322,000 --> 0:03:13,000
what goes on in the heads of procrastinators,

81
0:03:13.453,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and why we are the way we are.

82
0:03:14.917,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Now, I had a hypothesis

83
0:03:16.097,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that the brains of procrastinators were actually different

84
0:03:18.976,000 --> 0:03:19,000
than the brains of other people.

85
0:03:21.698,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And to test this, I found an MRI lab

86
0:03:23.913,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that actually let me scan both my brain

87
0:03:26.369,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator,

88
0:03:29.048,000 --> 0:03:3,000
so I could compare them.

89
0:03:30.507,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I actually brought them here to show you today.

90
0:03:32.732,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference.

91
0:03:36.293,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I know that if you're not a trained brain expert,

92
0:03:38.631,000 --> 0:03:4,000
it's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK?

93
0:03:40.918,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator.

94
0:03:43.835,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

95
0:03:46.133,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Now ...

96
0:03:48.325,000 --> 0:03:49,000
here's my brain.

97
0:03:50.28,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Laughter)

98
0:03:55.713,000 --> 0:03:56,000
There is a difference.

99
0:03:57.904,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them,

100
0:04:00.316,000 --> 0:04:01,000
but the procrastinator's brain

101
0:04:01.992,000 --> 0:04:03,000
also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.

102
0:04:05.002,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator?

103
0:04:07.328,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Well, it means everything's fine until this happens.

104
0:04:09.793,000 --> 0:04:11,000
[This is a perfect time to get some work done.] [Nope!]

105
0:04:12.439,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision

106
0:04:15.396,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to do something productive,

107
0:04:17.316,000 --> 0:04:18,000
but the Monkey doesn't like that plan,

108
0:04:19.29,000 --> 0:04:2,000
so he actually takes the wheel,

109
0:04:20.822,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and he says, "Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page

110
0:04:23.727,000 --> 0:04:25,000
of the Nancy Kerrigan/ Tonya Harding scandal,

111
0:04:25.887,000 --> 0:04:27,000
because I just remembered that that happened.

112
0:04:28.042,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Laughter)

113
0:04:29.082,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Then --

114
0:04:30.264,000 --> 0:04:31,000
(Laughter)

115
0:04:31.551,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Then we're going to go over to the fridge,

116
0:04:33.613,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago.

117
0:04:36.503,000 --> 0:04:38,000
After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral

118
0:04:39.165,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets

119
0:04:42.439,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and ends much, much later with us watching interviews

120
0:04:45.179,000 --> 0:04:46,000
with Justin Bieber's mom.

121
0:04:47.083,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Laughter)

122
0:04:49.295,000 --> 0:04:5,000
"All of that's going to take a while,

123
0:04:51.082,000 --> 0:04:54,000
so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today.

124
0:04:54.608,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Sorry!"

125
0:04:55.795,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Sigh)

126
0:04:58.325,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Now, what is going on here?

127
0:05:03.481,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy

128
0:05:06.196,000 --> 0:05:07,000
you want behind the wheel.

129
0:05:07.474,000 --> 0:05:08,000
He lives entirely in the present moment.

130
0:05:09.443,000 --> 0:05:11,000
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future,

131
0:05:12.295,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and he only cares about two things:

132
0:05:14.016,000 --> 0:05:15,000
easy and fun.

133
0:05:16.338,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Now, in the animal world, that works fine.

134
0:05:19.454,000 --> 0:05:2,000
If you're a dog

135
0:05:20.686,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things,

136
0:05:24.281,000 --> 0:05:25,000
you're a huge success!

137
0:05:25.47,000 --> 0:05:26,000
(Laughter)

138
0:05:27.405,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And to the Monkey,

139
0:05:29.969,000 --> 0:05:31,000
humans are just another animal species.

140
0:05:32.087,000 --> 0:05:36,000
You have to keep well-slept, well-fed and propagating into the next generation,

141
0:05:36.617,000 --> 0:05:38,000
which in tribal times might have worked OK.

142
0:05:38.927,000 --> 0:05:4,000
But, if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times.

143
0:05:41.801,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We're in an advanced civilization, and the Monkey does not know what that is.

144
0:05:45.958,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Which is why we have another guy in our brain,

145
0:05:48.263,000 --> 0:05:5,000
the Rational Decision-Maker,

146
0:05:50.652,000 --> 0:05:53,000
who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do.

147
0:05:53.703,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We can visualize the future.

148
0:05:55.648,000 --> 0:05:56,000
We can see the big picture.

149
0:05:57.424,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We can make long-term plans.

150
0:05:58.798,000 --> 0:06:,000
And he wants to take all of that into account.

151
0:06:02.138,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And he wants to just have us do

152
0:06:03.853,000 --> 0:06:05,000
whatever makes sense to be doing right now.

153
0:06:06.825,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Now, sometimes it makes sense

154
0:06:08.238,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to be doing things that are easy and fun,

155
0:06:10.291,000 --> 0:06:12,000
like when you're having dinner or going to bed

156
0:06:12.466,000 --> 0:06:13,000
or enjoying well-earned leisure time.

157
0:06:14.318,000 --> 0:06:15,000
That's why there's an overlap.

158
0:06:15.792,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Sometimes they agree.

159
0:06:17.56,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But other times, it makes much more sense

160
0:06:20.406,000 --> 0:06:23,000
to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant,

161
0:06:24.032,000 --> 0:06:25,000
for the sake of the big picture.

162
0:06:25.596,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And that's when we have a conflict.

163
0:06:28.017,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And for the procrastinator,

164
0:06:29.356,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that conflict tends to end a certain way every time,

165
0:06:31.889,000 --> 0:06:34,000
leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone,

166
0:06:35.633,000 --> 0:06:39,000
an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the Makes Sense circle.

167
0:06:39.984,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I call it the Dark Playground.

168
0:06:42.287,000 --> 0:06:43,000
(Laughter)

169
0:06:43.935,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Now, the Dark Playground is a place

170
0:06:47.087,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that all of you procrastinators out there know very well.

171
0:06:50.892,000 --> 0:06:51,000
It's where leisure activities happen

172
0:06:52.72,000 --> 0:06:55,000
at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening.

173
0:06:56.418,000 --> 0:06:57,000
The fun you have in the Dark Playground

174
0:06:58.332,000 --> 0:07:,000
isn't actually fun, because it's completely unearned,

175
0:07:00.839,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred --

176
0:07:04.078,000 --> 0:07:06,000
all of those good procrastinator feelings.

177
0:07:06.703,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And the question is, in this situation, with the Monkey behind the wheel,

178
0:07:10.203,000 --> 0:07:13,000
how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone,

179
0:07:13.82,000 --> 0:07:16,000
a less pleasant place, but where really important things happen?

180
0:07:17.125,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Well, turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel,

181
0:07:22.186,000 --> 0:07:25,000
someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him

182
0:07:25.418,000 --> 0:07:26,000
in his darkest moments --

183
0:07:26.872,000 --> 0:07:28,000
someone called the Panic Monster.

184
0:07:28.991,000 --> 0:07:31,000
(Laughter)

185
0:07:34.386,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Now, the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time,

186
0:07:39.27,000 --> 0:07:42,000
but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close

187
0:07:43.196,000 --> 0:07:45,000
or there's danger of public embarrassment,

188
0:07:45.265,000 --> 0:07:47,000
a career disaster or some other scary consequence.

189
0:07:47.8,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And importantly, he's the only thing the Monkey is terrified of.

190
0:07:51.996,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently,

191
0:07:56.598,000 --> 0:07:59,000
because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago

192
0:07:59.868,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and invited me to do a TED Talk.

193
0:08:01.913,000 --> 0:08:03,000
(Laughter)

194
0:08:07.058,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Now, of course, I said yes.

195
0:08:08.989,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past.

196
0:08:12.818,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Laughter)

197
0:08:16.814,000 --> 0:08:19,000
(Applause)

198
0:08:24.203,000 --> 0:08:25,000
But in the middle of all this excitement,

199
0:08:26.196,000 --> 0:08:29,000
the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind.

200
0:08:29.521,000 --> 0:08:31,000
He was saying, "Are we clear on what we just accepted?

201
0:08:32.093,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future?

202
0:08:35.366,000 --> 0:08:37,000
We need to sit down and work on this right now."

203
0:08:37.657,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And the Monkey said, "Totally agree, but let's just open Google Earth

204
0:08:40.946,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and zoom in to the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground,

205
0:08:44.13,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country,

206
0:08:47.775,000 --> 0:08:48,000
so we can get a better feel for India."

207
0:08:49.777,000 --> 0:08:53,000
(Laughter)

208
0:08:55.149,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So that's what we did that day.

209
0:08:56.658,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Laughter)

210
0:09:00.604,000 --> 0:09:03,000
As six months turned into four and then two and then one,

211
0:09:04.524,000 --> 0:09:07,000
the people of TED decided to release the speakers.

212
0:09:07.643,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And I opened up the website, and there was my face

213
0:09:10.279,000 --> 0:09:11,000
staring right back at me.

214
0:09:11.659,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And guess who woke up?

215
0:09:13.283,000 --> 0:09:16,000
(Laughter)

216
0:09:17.43,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind,

217
0:09:19.904,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem.

218
0:09:22.674,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(Laughter)

219
0:09:27.511,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And the Monkey -- remember, he's terrified of the Panic Monster --

220
0:09:30.636,000 --> 0:09:31,000
boom, he's up the tree!

221
0:09:31.818,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And finally,

222
0:09:32.993,000 --> 0:09:34,000
finally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel

223
0:09:35.613,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and I can start working on the talk.

224
0:09:37.355,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Now, the Panic Monster explains

225
0:09:39.667,000 --> 0:09:42,000
all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior,

226
0:09:43.172,000 --> 0:09:45,000
like how someone like me could spend two weeks

227
0:09:45.53,000 --> 0:09:48,000
unable to start the opening sentence of a paper,

228
0:09:49.398,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic

229
0:09:52.193,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to stay up all night and write eight pages.

230
0:09:56.385,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And this entire situation, with the three characters --

231
0:09:59.391,000 --> 0:10:01,000
this is the procrastinator's system.

232
0:10:02.096,000 --> 0:10:05,000
It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.

233
0:10:05.545,000 --> 0:10:09,000
This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago.

234
0:10:09.631,000 --> 0:10:11,000
When I did, I was amazed by the response.

235
0:10:12.626,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Literally thousands of emails came in,

236
0:10:14.803,000 --> 0:10:16,000
from all different kinds of people from all over the world,

237
0:10:17.604,000 --> 0:10:18,000
doing all different kinds of things.

238
0:10:19.366,000 --> 0:10:21,000
These are people who were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers

239
0:10:22.356,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and lots and lots of PhD students.

240
0:10:24.702,000 --> 0:10:26,000
(Laughter)

241
0:10:26.727,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And they were all writing, saying the same thing:

242
0:10:29.039,000 --> 0:10:3,000
"I have this problem too."

243
0:10:31.015,000 --> 0:10:34,000
But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post

244
0:10:34.868,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and the heaviness of these emails.

245
0:10:36.987,000 --> 0:10:39,000
These people were writing with intense frustration

246
0:10:40.094,000 --> 0:10:42,000
about what procrastination had done to their lives,

247
0:10:42.88,000 --> 0:10:44,000
about what this Monkey had done to them.

248
0:10:46.902,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And I thought about this, and I said,

249
0:10:49.892,000 --> 0:10:52,000
well, if the procrastinator's system works, then what's going on?

250
0:10:53.028,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Why are all of these people in such a dark place?

251
0:10:55.538,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination.

252
0:10:59.987,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given,

253
0:11:02.845,000 --> 0:11:03,000
they all have deadlines.

254
0:11:04.02,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And when there's deadlines,

255
0:11:05.342,000 --> 0:11:07,000
the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term

256
0:11:08.291,000 --> 0:11:09,000
because the Panic Monster gets involved.

257
0:11:10.228,000 --> 0:11:12,000
But there's a second kind of procrastination

258
0:11:12.306,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that happens in situations when there is no deadline.

259
0:11:14.817,000 --> 0:11:16,000
So if you wanted a career where you're a self-starter --

260
0:11:17.531,000 --> 0:11:19,000
something in the arts, something entrepreneurial --

261
0:11:19.968,000 --> 0:11:22,000
there's no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing's happening,

262
0:11:23.517,000 --> 0:11:25,000
not until you've gone out and done the hard work

263
0:11:25.785,000 --> 0:11:26,000
to get momentum, get things going.

264
0:11:27.435,000 --> 0:11:3,000
There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career

265
0:11:30.537,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that don't involve any deadlines,

266
0:11:32.166,000 --> 0:11:35,000
like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health,

267
0:11:35.455,000 --> 0:11:36,000
working on your relationship

268
0:11:36.883,000 --> 0:11:38,000
or getting out of a relationship that isn't working.

269
0:11:39.588,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things

270
0:11:44.76,000 --> 0:11:45,000
is the Panic Monster, that's a problem,

271
0:11:46.669,000 --> 0:11:48,000
because in all of these non-deadline situations,

272
0:11:49.493,000 --> 0:11:5,000
the Panic Monster doesn't show up.

273
0:11:51.145,000 --> 0:11:52,000
He has nothing to wake up for,

274
0:11:52.621,000 --> 0:11:54,000
so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained;

275
0:11:55.343,000 --> 0:11:56,000
they just extend outward forever.

276
0:11:57.953,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And it's this long-term kind of procrastination

277
0:12:00.717,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that's much less visible and much less talked about

278
0:12:03.822,000 --> 0:12:05,000
than the funnier, short-term deadline-based kind.

279
0:12:06.747,000 --> 0:12:09,000
It's usually suffered quietly and privately.

280
0:12:10.816,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And it can be the source

281
0:12:11.994,000 --> 0:12:14,000
of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and regrets.

282
0:12:16.576,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And I thought, that's why those people are emailing,

283
0:12:19.472,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and that's why they're in such a bad place.

284
0:12:21.998,000 --> 0:12:23,000
It's not that they're cramming for some project.

285
0:12:24.766,000 --> 0:12:27,000
It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator,

286
0:12:28.211,000 --> 0:12:3,000
at times, in their own lives.

287
0:12:30.594,000 --> 0:12:32,000
The frustration is not that they couldn't achieve their dreams;

288
0:12:33.6,000 --> 0:12:36,000
it's that they weren't even able to start chasing them.

289
0:12:36.713,000 --> 0:12:4,000
So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany --

290
0:12:42.182,000 --> 0:12:45,000
that I don't think non-procrastinators exist.

291
0:12:45.979,000 --> 0:12:48,000
That's right -- I think all of you are procrastinators.

292
0:12:49.898,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Now, you might not all be a mess,

293
0:12:51.836,000 --> 0:12:52,000
like some of us,

294
0:12:53.21,000 --> 0:12:54,000
(Laughter)

295
0:12:54.763,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines,

296
0:12:58.103,000 --> 0:13:,000
but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick

297
0:13:00.651,000 --> 0:13:01,000
is when the deadlines aren't there.

298
0:13:03.249,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Now, I want to show you one last thing.

299
0:13:05.305,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I call this a Life Calendar.

300
0:13:08.352,000 --> 0:13:12,000
That's one box for every week of a 90-year life.

301
0:13:13.345,000 --> 0:13:14,000
That's not that many boxes,

302
0:13:14.958,000 --> 0:13:16,000
especially since we've already used a bunch of those.

303
0:13:18.607,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar.

304
0:13:24.977,000 --> 0:13:27,000
We need to think about what we're really procrastinating on,

305
0:13:28.014,000 --> 0:13:31,000
because everyone is procrastinating on something in life.

306
0:13:32.782,000 --> 0:13:35,000
We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey.

307
0:13:37.455,000 --> 0:13:39,000
That's a job for all of us.

308
0:13:40.669,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And because there's not that many boxes on there,

309
0:13:42.993,000 --> 0:13:44,000
it's a job that should probably start today.

310
0:13:45.307,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Well, maybe not today, but ...

311
0:13:48.331,000 --> 0:13:49,000
(Laughter)

312
0:13:49.996,000 --> 0:13:5,000
You know.

313
0:13:51.576,000 --> 0:13:52,000

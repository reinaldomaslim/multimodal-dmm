1
0:00:14.048,000 --> 0:00:15,000
This one's personal.

2
0:00:17.309,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I know what it's like to have the government say,

3
0:00:20.62,000 --> 0:00:22,000
"We're going to kill you in the morning."

4
0:00:24.314,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I know what it's like to leave a country on six hours' notice

5
0:00:27.909,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and land on someone's couch.

6
0:00:29.781,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Because of that, I wrote a book

7
0:00:31.306,000 --> 0:00:34,000
on why countries do well and why they don't.

8
0:00:35.246,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Let me summarize 250 pages.

9
0:00:37.809,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Countries have to be compassionate,

10
0:00:39.548,000 --> 0:00:4,000
they have to be kind,

11
0:00:40.722,000 --> 0:00:42,000
they have to be smart, they have to be brave.

12
0:00:43.539,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Want to know what doesn't work?

13
0:00:45.085,000 --> 0:00:48,000
When you govern through fear and you govern through cruelty,

14
0:00:48.133,000 --> 0:00:49,000
it just doesn't work.

15
0:00:50.117,000 --> 0:00:51,000
You can play Genghis Khan for a while,

16
0:00:51.962,000 --> 0:00:52,000
you can play Stalin for a while,

17
0:00:53.536,000 --> 0:00:54,000
you can play Pinochet for a while.

18
0:00:55.521,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It does not work in the long run.

19
0:00:58.776,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And it doesn't work in the long run

20
0:01:00.482,000 --> 0:01:02,000
because to govern through fear and cruelty,

21
0:01:03.196,000 --> 0:01:05,000
you have to create a division.

22
0:01:05.855,000 --> 0:01:07,000
You have to take big chunks of the country and convince them

23
0:01:08.847,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that they're not like them.

24
0:01:11.862,000 --> 0:01:12,000
That they shouldn't associate with them,

25
0:01:13.8,000 --> 0:01:14,000
they shouldn't talk to them.

26
0:01:15.212,000 --> 0:01:16,000
That those people are nasty,

27
0:01:16.593,000 --> 0:01:18,000
those people are criminals, those people are rapists.

28
0:01:20.701,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And the country is in danger because of them.

29
0:01:24.551,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And if you spend millions of dollars doing that in your country,

30
0:01:28.416,000 --> 0:01:29,000
you will make enemies abroad,

31
0:01:32.097,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and you will create divisions within.

32
0:01:35.149,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And that has consequences.

33
0:01:37.355,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Three quarters of the flags and the borders and the anthems

34
0:01:40.285,000 --> 0:01:41,000
around the United Nations today,

35
0:01:41.856,000 --> 0:01:43,000
they were not there a few decades ago.

36
0:01:45.577,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Those lines that are there today,

37
0:01:47.188,000 --> 0:01:49,000
those flags were created because somebody said,

38
0:01:49.966,000 --> 0:01:5,000
"the Scotts are not like us,"

39
0:01:51.482,000 --> 0:01:52,000
"the Welsh are not like us,"

40
0:01:52.847,000 --> 0:01:53,000
"the Basques are not like us,"

41
0:01:54.312,000 --> 0:01:55,000
"the northern Italians are not like us,"

42
0:01:56.257,000 --> 0:01:57,000
"the Muslims are not like us,"

43
0:01:57.76,000 --> 0:01:59,000
the blacks, the whites, the Christians.

44
0:02:01.442,000 --> 0:02:02,000
You create "us versus them" ...

45
0:02:04.347,000 --> 0:02:05,000
you destroy nations.

46
0:02:07.173,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Part of the problem from creating us versus them

47
0:02:09.45,000 --> 0:02:1,000
is it's hard to do.

48
0:02:12.109,000 --> 0:02:13,000
What you have to do

49
0:02:13.307,000 --> 0:02:15,000
is you have to make people believe absurdities.

50
0:02:17.096,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And once people believe absurdities,

51
0:02:19.611,000 --> 0:02:21,000
then they start to commit atrocities.

52
0:02:22.239,000 --> 0:02:23,000
That's the dynamic of this thing.

53
0:02:23.858,000 --> 0:02:25,000
You can't create "us versus them" --

54
0:02:26.236,000 --> 0:02:28,000
you can't have the massacres you had in Rwanda,

55
0:02:28.458,000 --> 0:02:3,000
you can't have the massacres you had in Yugoslavia --

56
0:02:31.839,000 --> 0:02:33,000
unless if you create this dynamic.

57
0:02:34.339,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Let me summarize current immigration policy.

58
0:02:36.656,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Let's deter "Them"

59
0:02:38.498,000 --> 0:02:41,000
by being as cruel as we can possibly be,

60
0:02:41.863,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and let's target their children.

61
0:02:45.474,000 --> 0:02:47,000
They are going after the children.

62
0:02:49.252,000 --> 0:02:52,000
You have US lawyers arguing that kids do not need

63
0:02:52.434,000 --> 0:02:54,000
soap or hugs or showers,

64
0:02:54.974,000 --> 0:02:55,000
adult help or a release date.

65
0:02:57.293,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Somebody gets pulled over for a broken tail light,

66
0:02:59.678,000 --> 0:03:01,000
who's worked here for 20 years,

67
0:03:02.459,000 --> 0:03:03,000
gets thrown into jail,

68
0:03:04.158,000 --> 0:03:05,000
maybe for life,

69
0:03:05.705,000 --> 0:03:06,000
with no legal representation.

70
0:03:07.53,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The terrorists that blew up the World Trade Center get lawyers.

71
0:03:11.514,000 --> 0:03:14,000
These kids, these parents, they don't get lawyers.

72
0:03:15.966,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Governments are telling

73
0:03:17.189,000 --> 0:03:19,000
some of the most desperate, hurt people on earth,

74
0:03:19.522,000 --> 0:03:22,000
"I took your child, pay me 800 dollars for a DNA test before you get it back."

75
0:03:24.784,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Three-year-olds are appearing in court.

76
0:03:27.649,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Look, we've all watched these courtroom dramas.

77
0:03:31.769,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And it's exciting,

78
0:03:32.968,000 --> 0:03:34,000
because the wise judge sits up there,

79
0:03:35.801,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and the defense lawyer attacks

80
0:03:37.821,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and the prosecutor counterattacks,

81
0:03:39.807,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and then you figure out how it's going to happen.

82
0:03:42.212,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I want you to understand what is happening right now.

83
0:03:47.22,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Prosecutor's there -- it's the tough prosecutor.

84
0:03:52.45,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Accusing, attacking, on behalf of we the people.

85
0:03:57.436,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The judge is up there, Judge Muckety-muck,

86
0:03:59.632,000 --> 0:04:,000
with his black robes,

87
0:04:02.381,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and he's questioning the defendant

88
0:04:04.032,000 --> 0:04:06,000
from up there.

89
0:04:07.569,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And the defendant is three years old

90
0:04:09.379,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and the eyes don't reach the side of the table.

91
0:04:14.514,000 --> 0:04:16,000
The defendant does not speak the language.

92
0:04:17.911,000 --> 0:04:21,000
The earphones for the translator have fallen off the defendant's head,

93
0:04:22.228,000 --> 0:04:27,000
because there are no headphones for three-year-olds in US courtrooms,

94
0:04:28.498,000 --> 0:04:3,000
because they are not supposed to defend themselves.

95
0:04:33.223,000 --> 0:04:34,000
This makes a mockery of justice,

96
0:04:34.913,000 --> 0:04:36,000
it makes a mockery of the prosecution system,

97
0:04:37.04,000 --> 0:04:39,000
it makes a mockery of who we are as a nation.

98
0:04:40.143,000 --> 0:04:41,000
These are absurdities.

99
0:04:42.443,000 --> 0:04:43,000
These are atrocities.

100
0:04:43.65,000 --> 0:04:44,000
This is unbelievable.

101
0:04:45.586,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And we're looking at a bunch of statistics,

102
0:04:47.625,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but I want you to understand,

103
0:04:49.983,000 --> 0:04:53,000
this is happening to the housekeeper who brought up your kids.

104
0:04:55.529,000 --> 0:04:58,000
This is happening to the gardener who took care of your house.

105
0:05:00.291,000 --> 0:05:02,000
This is happening to the guy who washed the dishes

106
0:05:02.863,000 --> 0:05:04,000
in the fancy restaurant you went to last week.

107
0:05:07.049,000 --> 0:05:1,000
This is happening to the people who deliver the newspaper in the mornings.

108
0:05:10.559,000 --> 0:05:11,000
This is your community,

109
0:05:12.072,000 --> 0:05:16,000
these are the people who have lived side by side with you.

110
0:05:17.467,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Treated you well,

111
0:05:18.657,000 --> 0:05:19,000
treated you with respect,

112
0:05:19.88,000 --> 0:05:2,000
taken care of your kids,

113
0:05:21.15,000 --> 0:05:22,000
taken care of your grandparents.

114
0:05:22.753,000 --> 0:05:24,000
This is Luis, this is Laura,

115
0:05:25.15,000 --> 0:05:26,000
this is Jaime.

116
0:05:26.918,000 --> 0:05:27,000
This isn't some abstract,

117
0:05:28.633,000 --> 0:05:29,000
"Oh, it's happening at the border" --

118
0:05:30.452,000 --> 0:05:32,000
this is happening in our community, right now.

119
0:05:35.765,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And the danger in this stuff

120
0:05:37.138,000 --> 0:05:4,000
is once you start normalizing absurdities and atrocities,

121
0:05:40.797,000 --> 0:05:42,000
people think that those instruments are legitimate.

122
0:05:43.416,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So you get school boards sending out letters like this:

123
0:05:46.41,000 --> 0:05:47,000
"Dear Parent,

124
0:05:47.894,000 --> 0:05:51,000
because your kid owes lunch money to the cafeteria,

125
0:05:52.068,000 --> 0:05:54,000
the result may be that your child will be taken away

126
0:05:54.62,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and put in foster care."

127
0:05:56.355,000 --> 0:05:57,000
This is going out from school boards

128
0:05:58.155,000 --> 0:05:59,000
because people think,

129
0:05:59.346,000 --> 0:06:02,000
"Well, that seems to be an instrument of deterrence."

130
0:06:05.219,000 --> 0:06:06,000
When you board an airplane,

131
0:06:08.147,000 --> 0:06:11,000
before kids, before first class,

132
0:06:12.164,000 --> 0:06:13,000
soldiers in uniform board.

133
0:06:15.981,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Some of them are immigrants.

134
0:06:18.545,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Here's a contract: join the army,

135
0:06:21.402,000 --> 0:06:23,000
serve your term, be honorably discharged,

136
0:06:23.703,000 --> 0:06:24,000
get citizenship.

137
0:06:26.243,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We are rescinding those contracts

138
0:06:28.387,000 --> 0:06:29,000
after they have been signed.

139
0:06:31.442,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And if those soldiers are killed in action,

140
0:06:33.862,000 --> 0:06:36,000
we are deporting their wives, and sometimes, their children.

141
0:06:37.823,000 --> 0:06:39,000
These are the people who protect us.

142
0:06:39.919,000 --> 0:06:41,000
These are the people that we honor.

143
0:06:42.617,000 --> 0:06:43,000
These are the brave.

144
0:06:43.871,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And this is how we're treating them.

145
0:06:45.617,000 --> 0:06:47,000
These are not the people who cross the border illegally.

146
0:06:48.585,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Once you start allowing this kind of behavior,

147
0:06:51.942,000 --> 0:06:55,000
it normalizes into a society, and it rips the society apart.

148
0:06:57.045,000 --> 0:07:,000
Countries are built on the hard work and grit of immigrants;

149
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
we are all immigrants.

150
0:07:02.165,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We just came at different times.

151
0:07:04.546,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Fifty-five percent of this country's main businesses,

152
0:07:09.578,000 --> 0:07:12,000
the most successful businesses in this country, the unicorns,

153
0:07:13.149,000 --> 0:07:16,000
are built by people who came as foreign students or as immigrants,

154
0:07:17.125,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and they're the founders or the cofounders.

155
0:07:19.919,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Well, here's what's happened over the last three years

156
0:07:22.704,000 --> 0:07:24,000
to the best brains in the world.

157
0:07:24.784,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Forty-two percent of them did not get visas

158
0:07:27.117,000 --> 0:07:28,000
or chose not to get visas.

159
0:07:29.411,000 --> 0:07:31,000
This is how you wipe out an economy.

160
0:07:31.927,000 --> 0:07:33,000
This isn't about kids and borders.

161
0:07:34.863,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It's about us.

162
0:07:37.696,000 --> 0:07:39,000
This is about who we are, who we the people are,

163
0:07:41.387,000 --> 0:07:43,000
as a nation and as individuals.

164
0:07:44.601,000 --> 0:07:46,000
This is not an abstract debate.

165
0:07:49.852,000 --> 0:07:5,000
A lot of us like to think

166
0:07:52.732,000 --> 0:07:55,000
if we had been back when Hitler was rising to power,

167
0:07:56.095,000 --> 0:07:57,000
we would have been out in the street,

168
0:07:57.927,000 --> 0:07:59,000
we would have opposed him, we would have stopped Mengele.

169
0:08:00.665,000 --> 0:08:01,000
A lot of us like to think,

170
0:08:03.276,000 --> 0:08:04,000
if we had been around during the '60s,

171
0:08:05.252,000 --> 0:08:07,000
we would have been with the Freedom Riders.

172
0:08:07.379,000 --> 0:08:09,000
We would have been at that bridge in Selma.

173
0:08:09.934,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Well, guess what?

174
0:08:11.661,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Here's your chance.

175
0:08:13.241,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It's now.

176
0:08:14.606,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And as you're thinking about this stuff,

177
0:08:17.765,000 --> 0:08:18,000
it's not just the giant acts,

178
0:08:19.193,000 --> 0:08:21,000
it's not just go and block the bridge

179
0:08:21.352,000 --> 0:08:23,000
or chain yourself to something.

180
0:08:24.148,000 --> 0:08:26,000
It's what you do in your daily lives.

181
0:08:26.775,000 --> 0:08:31,000
The Harvard Art Museum just opened a show

182
0:08:31.942,000 --> 0:08:34,000
on how artists think about immigration and building a home somewhere else.

183
0:08:35.48,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And people come out of that show and they're pretty shaken.

184
0:08:38.434,000 --> 0:08:39,000
There was a blank wall at the end.

185
0:08:41.658,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And the curators did something that usually doesn't happen --

186
0:08:44.777,000 --> 0:08:45,000
they improvised.

187
0:08:46.554,000 --> 0:08:48,000
They drew four lines, and put in two words:

188
0:08:49.515,000 --> 0:08:5,000
"I belong."

189
0:08:50.727,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So you come out of this exhibit,

190
0:08:52.323,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and you can take a picture in front of it.

191
0:08:54.395,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I can't tell you the impact that has on people --

192
0:08:56.839,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I watched people come out of this,

193
0:08:59.116,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and some of them sat in front of that picture,

194
0:09:01.561,000 --> 0:09:03,000
took a picture, and they had a great, big grin on their face,

195
0:09:04.514,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and some people just had tears.

196
0:09:07.173,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Some people hugged and brought in strangers,

197
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
others brought in their family.

198
0:09:13.796,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Small acts of kindness go a long, long, long way.

199
0:09:18.677,000 --> 0:09:19,000
There is pain going on in your community

200
0:09:20.645,000 --> 0:09:21,000
like you cannot believe.

201
0:09:23.025,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So next time you're with a cab driver who may be one of "Them,"

202
0:09:26.113,000 --> 0:09:28,000
according to certain people,

203
0:09:28.462,000 --> 0:09:3,000
give that person an extra five bucks.

204
0:09:32.025,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Next time you see a hotel maid,

205
0:09:34.651,000 --> 0:09:35,000
thank her and tip her double.

206
0:09:37.895,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Next time you see your gardener,

207
0:09:40.307,000 --> 0:09:42,000
you see your nanny,

208
0:09:42.355,000 --> 0:09:43,000
you see somebody like this,

209
0:09:43.736,000 --> 0:09:45,000
give them a great, big hug, and tell them they belong.

210
0:09:46.315,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Make them feel like they belong.

211
0:09:48.856,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It's time for big policies,

212
0:09:50.213,000 --> 0:09:53,000
but it's also time for big acts of kindness.

213
0:09:55.206,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Because we have to reclaim who we are,

214
0:09:57.134,000 --> 0:09:59,000
we have to reclaim this nation.

215
0:09:59.712,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Voice breaking) And we cannot sit there

216
0:10:02.617,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and watch this shit going on.

217
0:10:05.791,000 --> 0:10:07,000
This has got to stop, it's got to stop now.

218
0:10:09.196,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Thank you.

219
0:10:10.397,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Applause)

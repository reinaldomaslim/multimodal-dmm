1
0:00:12.84,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Architecture is a profession with many rules,

2
0:00:16.04,000 --> 0:00:18,000
some written, some not,

3
0:00:18.48,000 --> 0:00:2,000
some relevant and others not.

4
0:00:21.32,000 --> 0:00:23,000
As architects, we're constantly gravitating

5
0:00:24.08,000 --> 0:00:28,000
between following these rules by the book

6
0:00:28.2,000 --> 0:00:3,000
or making a space for imagination --

7
0:00:30.6,000 --> 0:00:32,000
for experimentation.

8
0:00:32.92,000 --> 0:00:33,000
This is a difficult balance.

9
0:00:34.48,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Especially through architecture,

10
0:00:36.08,000 --> 0:00:4,000
you're trying to challenge preconceptions and push boundaries and innovate,

11
0:00:40.92,000 --> 0:00:44,000
even if just using what we have around and we overlook all the time.

12
0:00:45.72,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And this is what I've been doing along with my team,

13
0:00:48.2,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Ensamble Studio,

14
0:00:49.48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and from our very early works

15
0:00:51.6,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that happened in strict historic contexts,

16
0:00:54.4,000 --> 0:00:56,000
like the city of Santiago de Compostela.

17
0:00:57.08,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Here we built the General Society of Authors and Editors,

18
0:01:01.6,000 --> 0:01:02,000
a cultural building.

19
0:01:03.6,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And on top of all the regulations,

20
0:01:05.44,000 --> 0:01:08,000
we had to use stone by code

21
0:01:08.48,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and our experience was limited,

22
0:01:10.56,000 --> 0:01:13,000
but we had incredible references to learn from,

23
0:01:13.92,000 --> 0:01:15,000
some coming from the city itself

24
0:01:16.44,000 --> 0:01:18,000
or from nearby landscapes

25
0:01:19.08,000 --> 0:01:2,000
or other remote places

26
0:01:20.64,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that had impacted our education as architects,

27
0:01:23.4,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and maybe you recognize here.

28
0:01:25.96,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But somehow the finished products that industry made available

29
0:01:30.6,000 --> 0:01:33,000
for us as architects to use in our buildings

30
0:01:34.48,000 --> 0:01:35,000
seemed to have lost their soul.

31
0:01:36.64,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And so we decided to go to the nearby quarries

32
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to better understand the process that transforms a mountain

33
0:01:44.04,000 --> 0:01:47,000
into a perfectly square tile that you buy from a supplier.

34
0:01:47.84,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And we were taken by the monumental scale of the material

35
0:01:51.64,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and the actions to extract it.

36
0:01:54.56,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And looking carefully,

37
0:01:55.8,000 --> 0:01:58,000
we noticed hundreds of irregular blocks piling up everywhere.

38
0:01:59.36,000 --> 0:02:01,000
They are the leftovers of an extraction sequence:

39
0:02:01.8,000 --> 0:02:03,000
the ugly parts that nobody wants.

40
0:02:04.68,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But we wanted them.

41
0:02:06.24,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We were inspired.

42
0:02:08.04,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And it was a win-win situation

43
0:02:09.68,000 --> 0:02:13,000
where we could get this residual material of great quality,

44
0:02:14.52,000 --> 0:02:15,000
doomed to be crushed,

45
0:02:15.8,000 --> 0:02:16,000
at a very low cost.

46
0:02:17.92,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Now, we had to convince our clients that this was a good idea;

47
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:25,000
but foremost, we had to come up with a design process

48
0:02:25.68,000 --> 0:02:27,000
to reuse these randomly shaped rocks,

49
0:02:28.08,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and we had not done this before.

50
0:02:30.6,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Today everything would be much easier

51
0:02:32.64,000 --> 0:02:33,000
because we would go to the quarry

52
0:02:34.6,000 --> 0:02:37,000
with our smartphones equipped with 3-D scanners

53
0:02:38.08,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and we would document each rock,

54
0:02:40.44,000 --> 0:02:42,000
turn that into a digital model --

55
0:02:42.68,000 --> 0:02:44,000
highly engineer the whole process.

56
0:02:44.92,000 --> 0:02:45,000
But more than a decade ago,

57
0:02:46.6,000 --> 0:02:48,000
we had to embrace uncertainty

58
0:02:48.92,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and put on our boots, roll up our sleeves

59
0:02:52.08,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and move to the quarry for a hands-on experience.

60
0:02:56.08,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And we also had to become the contractors

61
0:02:58.68,000 --> 0:03:02,000
because we failed at finding somebody willing to share the risk with us.

62
0:03:05.88,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Now, luckily, we convinced the quarry team to help us build a few prototypes

63
0:03:11.08,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to resolve some of the technical details.

64
0:03:13.72,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And we agreed on a few mock-ups,

65
0:03:16.6,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but we got excited,

66
0:03:18.12,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and one stone led to another

67
0:03:20.4,000 --> 0:03:21,000
until we succeeded to build

68
0:03:22.28,000 --> 0:03:26,000
an 18-meter-long by eight-meter-high structure

69
0:03:27.72,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that recycled all the amorphous material of the quarry,

70
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:32,000
just supported by gravity --

71
0:03:32.76,000 --> 0:03:34,000
no mortar and no ties.

72
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And once built and tested,

73
0:03:38.32,000 --> 0:03:41,000
moving it to the final site in the city center

74
0:03:41.76,000 --> 0:03:43,000
to unite it with the rest of the building

75
0:03:44.28,000 --> 0:03:45,000
was a piece of cake,

76
0:03:45.64,000 --> 0:03:48,000
because by having isolated uncertainty

77
0:03:48.8,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and managed risk in the controlled environment of the quarry,

78
0:03:52.56,000 --> 0:03:54,000
we were able to complete the whole building in time

79
0:03:55.12,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and on budget,

80
0:03:56.36,000 --> 0:03:59,000
even if using nonconventional means and methods.

81
0:04:00.08,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And I still get goosebumps

82
0:04:01.64,000 --> 0:04:04,000
when I see this big chunk of the industrial landscape

83
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
in the city,

84
0:04:06.64,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in a building,

85
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:11,000
experienced by the visitors and the neighbors.

86
0:04:12.88,000 --> 0:04:15,000
This building gave us quite a few headaches,

87
0:04:16.36,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and so it could have well been an exception in our work,

88
0:04:20.52,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but instead it started to inform a modus operandi

89
0:04:24.84,000 --> 0:04:26,000
where every project becomes this opportunity

90
0:04:27.24,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to test the limits of a discipline we believe has to be urgently reimagined.

91
0:04:32.76,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So what you see here are four homes

92
0:04:34.72,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that we have designed, built and inhabited.

93
0:04:39.4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Four manifestos where we are using the small scale

94
0:04:42.76,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to ask ourselves big questions.

95
0:04:45.8,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And we are trying to discover the architectures

96
0:04:48.24,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that result from unconventional applications of pretty mundane materials

97
0:04:53.44,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and technologies,

98
0:04:54.96,000 --> 0:04:57,000
like concrete in different forms in the top row,

99
0:04:58.24,000 --> 0:05:01,000
or steel and foam in the bottom row.

100
0:05:01.28,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Take, for instance, these precast concrete beams.

101
0:05:03.48,000 --> 0:05:04,000
You have probably seen them

102
0:05:05.28,000 --> 0:05:08,000
building bridges, highways, water channels --

103
0:05:08.92,000 --> 0:05:11,000
we found them on one of our visits to a precast concrete factory.

104
0:05:13.96,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And they might not seem especially homey or beautiful,

105
0:05:17.96,000 --> 0:05:21,000
but we decided to use them to build our first house.

106
0:05:22.08,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And this was an incredible moment

107
0:05:24.08,000 --> 0:05:27,000
because we got to be architects as always,

108
0:05:27.52,000 --> 0:05:28,000
builders once more

109
0:05:28.84,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and, for the first time, we could be our own clients.

110
0:05:33.56,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So, here we are trying to figure out how we can take these huge catalogue beams

111
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:41,000
of about 20 tons each

112
0:05:41.24,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and stack them progressively around a courtyard space ...

113
0:05:46.36,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the heart of the house.

114
0:05:49.4,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And due to the dimensions and their material quality,

115
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
these big parts are the structure that carry the loads to the ground,

116
0:05:57.56,000 --> 0:05:59,000
but they are much more than that.

117
0:05:59.6,000 --> 0:06:,000
They are the swimming pool;

118
0:06:01.56,000 --> 0:06:04,000
they are the walls that divide interior from exterior;

119
0:06:05.48,000 --> 0:06:07,000
they are the windows that frame the views;

120
0:06:08.2,000 --> 0:06:09,000
they are the finishes;

121
0:06:09.64,000 --> 0:06:11,000
they are the very spirit of this house.

122
0:06:12.64,000 --> 0:06:14,000
A house that is for us a laboratory

123
0:06:15.12,000 --> 0:06:2,000
where we are testing how we can use standard elements in nonstandard ways.

124
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And we are observing that the results are intriguing.

125
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And we are learning by doing

126
0:06:26.4,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that prefabrication can be much more than stacking boxes

127
0:06:30.48,000 --> 0:06:33,000
or that heavy parts can be airy and transparent.

128
0:06:35.2,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And on top of designing and building this house,

129
0:06:38.12,000 --> 0:06:39,000
we get invaluable feedback,

130
0:06:39.48,000 --> 0:06:42,000
sharing it with our family and our friends

131
0:06:42.6,000 --> 0:06:43,000
because this is our life

132
0:06:44.52,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and our work in progress.

133
0:06:47.6,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The lessons that we learn here get translated into other projects

134
0:06:52.52,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and other programs

135
0:06:54.52,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and other scales as well,

136
0:06:57.8,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and they inspire new work.

137
0:06:59.92,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Here again we are looking at very standard products:

138
0:07:03.08,000 --> 0:07:06,000
galvanized steel studs that can be easily cut and screwed,

139
0:07:06.88,000 --> 0:07:09,000
insulating foams, cement boards --

140
0:07:10.2,000 --> 0:07:13,000
all materials that you can find hidden in partition walls

141
0:07:13.84,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and that we are exposing;

142
0:07:15.8,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and we are using them to build a very lightweight construction system

143
0:07:19.56,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that can be built almost by anyone.

144
0:07:23.4,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And we are doing it ourselves with our hands in our shop,

145
0:07:26.12,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and we are architects. We're not professional builders

146
0:07:29.32,000 --> 0:07:31,000
but we want to make sure it's possible.

147
0:07:31.64,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And it's so nice that Antón can move it with his hands

148
0:07:35.12,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and Javier can put it in a container,

149
0:07:37.76,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and we can ship it

150
0:07:39.36,000 --> 0:07:42,000
like you would ship your belongings if you were moving abroad ...

151
0:07:42.6,000 --> 0:07:43,000
which is what we did five years ago.

152
0:07:44.48,000 --> 0:07:45,000
We moved our gravity center from Madrid

153
0:07:46.44,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and the house of the concrete beams to Brookline.

154
0:07:50.08,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And we found the ugly duckling of a very nice neighborhood:

155
0:07:55.24,000 --> 0:07:57,000
a one-story garage and the only thing we could afford.

156
0:07:59.64,000 --> 0:08:02,000
But it was OK because we wanted to transform it into a swan,

157
0:08:03.2,000 --> 0:08:07,000
installing on top our just-delivered kit of parts,

158
0:08:07.88,000 --> 0:08:11,000
once more becoming the scientists and the guinea pigs.

159
0:08:14.04,000 --> 0:08:16,000
So this is a house that uses some of the cheapest

160
0:08:16.6,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and most normal materials that you can find in the market

161
0:08:20.24,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that applies the ubiquitous four-by-eight modulation

162
0:08:23.2,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that governs the construction industry.

163
0:08:26.6,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And yet a different organization of the spaces

164
0:08:30.12,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and a different assembly of the parts

165
0:08:32.52,000 --> 0:08:35,000
is able to transform an economically built home

166
0:08:36.04,000 --> 0:08:38,000
into a luxurious space.

167
0:08:40.04,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And now, we're dreaming and we're actively working with developers,

168
0:08:44.799,000 --> 0:08:45,000
with builders,

169
0:08:46.039,000 --> 0:08:47,000
with communities

170
0:08:47.72,000 --> 0:08:5,000
to try to make this a reality for many more homes

171
0:08:51.28,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and many more families.

172
0:08:54.72,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And you see, the world around us is an infinite source of inspiration

173
0:08:59.96,000 --> 0:09:03,000
if we are curious enough to see beneath the surface of things.

174
0:09:04.24,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Now I'm going to take you to the other side of the moon:

175
0:09:06.92,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to the sublime landscape of Montana,

176
0:09:10.28,000 --> 0:09:13,000
where a few years ago we joined Cathy and Peter Halstead

177
0:09:13.4,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to imagine Tippet Rise Art Center on a 10,000-acre working ranch.

178
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And when we first visited the site,

179
0:09:21.88,000 --> 0:09:25,000
we realized that all we knew about what an art center is

180
0:09:26.24,000 --> 0:09:29,000
was absolutely pointless for that client,

181
0:09:29.44,000 --> 0:09:31,000
for that community, for that landscape.

182
0:09:32.96,000 --> 0:09:36,000
The kind of white-box museum type had no fit here.

183
0:09:37.36,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So we decided to explode the center into a constellation of fragments,

184
0:09:42.88,000 --> 0:09:45,000
of spaces spread across the vast territory

185
0:09:46.6,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that would immerse the visitors into the wilderness of this amazing place.

186
0:09:52.96,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So back in the office, we are thinking through making,

187
0:09:55.84,000 --> 0:09:58,000
using the land both as support and as material,

188
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
learning from its geological processes of sedimentation, erosion,

189
0:10:03.08,000 --> 0:10:05,000
fragmentation, crystallization --

190
0:10:05.4,000 --> 0:10:06,000
explosion --

191
0:10:07.28,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to discover architectures that are born from the land,

192
0:10:11.8,000 --> 0:10:14,000
that are visceral extensions of the landscape,

193
0:10:16.36,000 --> 0:10:19,000
like this bridge that crosses Murphy Canyon.

194
0:10:20.44,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Or this fountain.

195
0:10:22.84,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Like this space topping a hill ...

196
0:10:26.72,000 --> 0:10:3,000
or this theatre that brings to us the space of the mountains

197
0:10:31.28,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and its sound.

198
0:10:33.72,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And in order to realize this idea,

199
0:10:35.52,000 --> 0:10:37,000
construction cannot be perfectly planned.

200
0:10:38.44,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We need to embrace the drastic weather and the local craft.

201
0:10:42.2,000 --> 0:10:45,000
We need to control just those aspects that are critical,

202
0:10:45.88,000 --> 0:10:46,000
like the structural, the thermal,

203
0:10:47.64,000 --> 0:10:5,000
the acoustical properties embedded in the form.

204
0:10:50.84,000 --> 0:10:54,000
But otherwise, improvisation is welcome and is provoked.

205
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And the moment of construction is still a moment of design

206
0:10:57.76,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and a moment of celebration

207
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
where different hands, hearts, minds come together to perform a final dance.

208
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And the result then cannot be anticipated.

209
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
It comes as a surprise.

210
0:11:13.04,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And we unwrap architecture like you would unwrap a birthday gift.

211
0:11:18.56,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Architecture isn't uncovered:

212
0:11:20.96,000 --> 0:11:21,000
it's discovered.

213
0:11:23.24,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It's extracted from the guts of the earth to build a shelter,

214
0:11:27.8,000 --> 0:11:29,000
one of the most basic human needs.

215
0:11:32.08,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Architecture, art, landscape,

216
0:11:35.08,000 --> 0:11:37,000
archaeology, geology -- all made one.

217
0:11:40.04,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And by using the resources at our disposal in radical ways,

218
0:11:43.8,000 --> 0:11:45,000
by making a space for experimentation,

219
0:11:46.52,000 --> 0:11:51,000
we are able to bring to light architectures that find the beauty latent

220
0:11:52.24,000 --> 0:11:55,000
in the raw and imperfect things that surround us,

221
0:11:56.28,000 --> 0:11:57,000
that elevate them

222
0:11:58.2,000 --> 0:12:,000
and let them speak their own language.

223
0:12:02.76,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Thank you.

224
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:07,000
(Applause)

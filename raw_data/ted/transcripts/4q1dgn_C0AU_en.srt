[Music]

2
0:00:14.91,000 --> 0:00:18,000
when you have 21 minutes to speak two

3
0:00:17.86,000 --> 0:00:21,000
million years seems like a really long

4
0:00:19.63,000 --> 0:00:23,000
time but evolutionarily two million

5
0:00:22.45,000 --> 0:00:26,000
years is nothing and yet in two million

6
0:00:24.04,000 --> 0:00:3,000
years the human brain has nearly tripled

7
0:00:26.86,000 --> 0:00:31,000
in mass going from the one and a quarter

8
0:00:30.189,000 --> 0:00:34,000
pound brain of our ancestor here habilis

9
0:00:32.8,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to the almost three pound meatloaf that

10
0:00:34.93,000 --> 0:00:41,000
everybody here has between their ears

11
0:00:37.92,000 --> 0:00:44,000
what is it about a big brain that nature

12
0:00:42.46,000 --> 0:00:47,000
was so eager for Everyone us to have one

13
0:00:45.1,000 --> 0:00:48,000
well it turns out when brings triple in

14
0:00:47.59,000 --> 0:00:51,000
size they don't just get three times

15
0:00:49.09,000 --> 0:00:53,000
bigger they gain new structures and one

16
0:00:52.09,000 --> 0:00:56,000
of the main reasons that our brain got

17
0:00:53.62,000 --> 0:00:57,000
so big is because it got a new part

18
0:00:56.17,000 --> 0:01:,000
called the frontal lobe and particularly

19
0:00:58.45,000 --> 0:01:02,000
a part called the prefrontal cortex now

20
0:01:01.15,000 --> 0:01:04,000
what does the prefrontal cortex do for

21
0:01:02.83,000 --> 0:01:06,000
you that should justify the entire

22
0:01:05.14,000 --> 0:01:09,000
architectural overhaul of the human

23
0:01:07.15,000 --> 0:01:11,000
skull in the blink of evolutionary time

24
0:01:09.58,000 --> 0:01:13,000
well turns out the prefrontal cortex

25
0:01:11.35,000 --> 0:01:15,000
does lots of things but one of the most

26
0:01:13.84,000 --> 0:01:17,000
important things it does is it is an

27
0:01:16.329,000 --> 0:01:2,000
experience simulator

28
0:01:18.52,000 --> 0:01:22,000
you know flight pilots practice in

29
0:01:21.31,000 --> 0:01:25,000
flight simulators so that they don't

30
0:01:23.109,000 --> 0:01:27,000
make real mistakes and planes human

31
0:01:25.869,000 --> 0:01:29,000
beings have this marvelous adaptation

32
0:01:27.999,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that they can actually have experiences

33
0:01:30.28,000 --> 0:01:34,000
in their heads before they try them out

34
0:01:33.46,000 --> 0:01:36,000
in real life this is a trick that none

35
0:01:35.079,000 --> 0:01:4,000
of our ancestors could do that no other

36
0:01:37.359,000 --> 0:01:41,000
animal can do quite like we can it's a

37
0:01:40.149,000 --> 0:01:44,000
marvellous adaptation it's up there with

38
0:01:42.34,000 --> 0:01:45,000
opposable thumbs and standing upright

39
0:01:44.2,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and language as one of the things that

40
0:01:46.299,000 --> 0:01:53,000
got our species out of the trees and

41
0:01:48.34,000 --> 0:01:54,000
into the shopping mall now all of you

42
0:01:53.38,000 --> 0:01:56,000
have done this I mean you know Ben and

43
0:01:55.209,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Jerry's doesn't have liver in onion ice

44
0:01:57.249,000 --> 0:02:01,000
cream and it's not because they whipped

45
0:01:59.38,000 --> 0:02:03,000
some up tried it and went yuck

46
0:02:01.299,000 --> 0:02:05,000
it's because from without leaving your

47
0:02:03.759,000 --> 0:02:1,000
armchair you can simulate that flavor

48
0:02:06.189,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and say yuck before you make it let's

49
0:02:11.35,000 --> 0:02:14,000
see how your experience simulators are

50
0:02:13.51,000 --> 0:02:16,000
working let's just run a quick

51
0:02:14.68,000 --> 0:02:17,000
diagnostic before I proceed with the

52
0:02:16.72,000 --> 0:02:2,000
rest of the talk here's two different

53
0:02:18.64,000 --> 0:02:22,000
futures that I invite you to contemplate

54
0:02:20.98,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and you can try to simulate them and

55
0:02:23.17,000 --> 0:02:27,000
tell me which one you think you

56
0:02:24.43,000 --> 0:02:29,000
might prefer one of them is winning the

57
0:02:27.549,000 --> 0:02:32,000
lottery this is about 314 million

58
0:02:30.25,000 --> 0:02:33,000
dollars and the other is becoming

59
0:02:32.709,000 --> 0:02:36,000
paraplegic

60
0:02:33.959,000 --> 0:02:37,000
so just given a moment of thought you

61
0:02:36.879,000 --> 0:02:39,000
probably don't feel like you need a

62
0:02:38.17,000 --> 0:02:43,000
moment of thought and interestingly

63
0:02:39.989,000 --> 0:02:44,000
there are data on these two groups of

64
0:02:43.329,000 --> 0:02:47,000
people data on how happy they are and

65
0:02:45.579,000 --> 0:02:49,000
this is exactly what you expected isn't

66
0:02:47.95,000 --> 0:02:51,000
it but these aren't the data

67
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I made these up these are the data you

68
0:02:52.9,000 --> 0:02:55,000
failed the pop quiz in your hardly five

69
0:02:55.12,000 --> 0:02:59,000
minutes into the lecture because the

70
0:02:56.65,000 --> 0:03:01,000
fact is that a year after losing the use

71
0:02:59.439,000 --> 0:03:03,000
of their legs and a year after winning

72
0:03:01.81,000 --> 0:03:06,000
the lotto lottery winners and

73
0:03:03.849,000 --> 0:03:08,000
paraplegics are equally happy with their

74
0:03:07.09,000 --> 0:03:1,000
lives now don't feel too bad about

75
0:03:09.219,000 --> 0:03:12,000
failing the first pop quiz because

76
0:03:11.049,000 --> 0:03:15,000
everybody fails all of the pop quizzes

77
0:03:13.12,000 --> 0:03:17,000
all of the time the research that my

78
0:03:15.76,000 --> 0:03:18,000
laboratory has been doing that

79
0:03:17.29,000 --> 0:03:2,000
economists and psychologists around the

80
0:03:18.969,000 --> 0:03:21,000
country have been doing have revealed

81
0:03:20.709,000 --> 0:03:24,000
something really quite startling to us

82
0:03:22.769,000 --> 0:03:26,000
something we call the impact bias which

83
0:03:25.329,000 --> 0:03:3,000
is the tendency for the simulator to

84
0:03:27.159,000 --> 0:03:33,000
work badly for the simulator to make you

85
0:03:30.37,000 --> 0:03:34,000
believe that different outcomes are more

86
0:03:33.489,000 --> 0:03:36,000
different than in fact they really are

87
0:03:35.139,000 --> 0:03:39,000
from field studies to laboratory studies

88
0:03:37.419,000 --> 0:03:41,000
we see that winning or losing an

89
0:03:39.519,000 --> 0:03:43,000
election gaining or losing a romantic

90
0:03:41.709,000 --> 0:03:44,000
partner getting or not getting a

91
0:03:43.54,000 --> 0:03:48,000
promotion passing or not passing a

92
0:03:45.459,000 --> 0:03:5,000
college test on and on have far less

93
0:03:48.819,000 --> 0:03:53,000
impact less intensity and much less

94
0:03:51.25,000 --> 0:03:57,000
duration that people expect them to have

95
0:03:54.459,000 --> 0:04:,000
effect a recent study this almost fleurs

96
0:03:57.459,000 --> 0:04:03,000
me a recent study showing how major life

97
0:04:00.97,000 --> 0:04:04,000
traumas affect people suggests that if

98
0:04:03.729,000 --> 0:04:07,000
it happened over three months ago with

99
0:04:05.59,000 --> 0:04:12,000
only a few exceptions it has no impact

100
0:04:07.75,000 --> 0:04:15,000
whatsoever on your happiness why because

101
0:04:13.54,000 --> 0:04:19,000
happiness can be synthesized

102
0:04:16.72,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Sir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642 I am the

103
0:04:19.63,000 --> 0:04:23,000
happiest man alive I have that in me

104
0:04:22.12,000 --> 0:04:26,000
that can convert poverty to riches

105
0:04:23.94,000 --> 0:04:28,000
adversity to prosperity I am more in

106
0:04:26.979,000 --> 0:04:3,000
vulnerable than Achilles fortune hath

107
0:04:29.44,000 --> 0:04:32,000
not one place to hit me kind of

108
0:04:31.539,000 --> 0:04:35,000
remarkable machinery does this guy have

109
0:04:33.25,000 --> 0:04:37,000
in his head well it turns out it's

110
0:04:35.56,000 --> 0:04:41,000
precisely the same remarkable motion

111
0:04:37.759,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that all of us have human beings have

112
0:04:41.569,000 --> 0:04:45,000
something that we might think of as a

113
0:04:43.339,000 --> 0:04:47,000
psychological immune system a system of

114
0:04:46.279,000 --> 0:04:5,000
cognitive processes largely non

115
0:04:48.139,000 --> 0:04:53,000
conscious cognitive processes that help

116
0:04:50.93,000 --> 0:04:54,000
them change their views of the world so

117
0:04:54.05,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that they can feel better about the

118
0:04:55.729,000 --> 0:05:,000
worlds in which they find themselves

119
0:04:57.789,000 --> 0:05:03,000
like Sir Thomas you have this machine on

120
0:05:00.979,000 --> 0:05:07,000
like Sir Thomas you seem not to know it

121
0:05:04.569,000 --> 0:05:1,000
we synthesize happiness but we think

122
0:05:08.18,000 --> 0:05:12,000
happiness is a thing to be found now you

123
0:05:10.819,000 --> 0:05:14,000
don't need me to tell you give you too

124
0:05:12.8,000 --> 0:05:15,000
many examples of people synthesizing

125
0:05:15.169,000 --> 0:05:18,000
happiness I suspect though I'm gonna

126
0:05:16.669,000 --> 0:05:19,000
show you some experimental evidence you

127
0:05:18.589,000 --> 0:05:22,000
don't have to look very far for evidence

128
0:05:20.36,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I as a challenge to myself since I say

129
0:05:23.149,000 --> 0:05:26,000
this once in a while in lectures I took

130
0:05:24.86,000 --> 0:05:26,000
a copy of the New York Times and tried

131
0:05:26.539,000 --> 0:05:28,000
to find some instances of people

132
0:05:27.71,000 --> 0:05:3,000
synthesizing happiness and here are

133
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
three guys synthesizing happiness I'm so

134
0:05:31.61,000 --> 0:05:34,000
much better off physically financially

135
0:05:33.349,000 --> 0:05:36,000
emotionally in almost every other way

136
0:05:34.909,000 --> 0:05:37,000
mentally almost every other way and I'm

137
0:05:37.279,000 --> 0:05:4,000
a 1 minutes regret it was a glorious

138
0:05:38.779,000 --> 0:05:41,000
experience I believe it turned out for

139
0:05:40.37,000 --> 0:05:43,000
the best who are these characters who

140
0:05:42.02,000 --> 0:05:45,000
are so damn happy well the first one is

141
0:05:44.029,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Jim Wright some of you are old enough to

142
0:05:45.77,000 --> 0:05:49,000
remember he was the chairman of the

143
0:05:47.749,000 --> 0:05:51,000
House of Representatives and he resigned

144
0:05:50.569,000 --> 0:05:53,000
in disgrace when this young Republican

145
0:05:52.31,000 --> 0:05:55,000
named Newt Gingrich found out about a

146
0:05:53.81,000 --> 0:05:56,000
shady book deal he had done he lost

147
0:05:55.639,000 --> 0:05:59,000
everything most powerful Democrat in the

148
0:05:57.409,000 --> 0:06:01,000
country lost everything lost his money

149
0:05:59.689,000 --> 0:06:03,000
lost his power what does he have to say

150
0:06:02.209,000 --> 0:06:06,000
all these years later about it I am so

151
0:06:04.399,000 --> 0:06:07,000
much better off physically financially

152
0:06:06.469,000 --> 0:06:09,000
mentally in almost every other way what

153
0:06:08.18,000 --> 0:06:13,000
other way would there be to be better

154
0:06:10.099,000 --> 0:06:14,000
off vegetable e minerally animal e he's

155
0:06:13.49,000 --> 0:06:16,000
pretty much covered in there

156
0:06:14.779,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Maurice victim is somebody you've never

157
0:06:16.849,000 --> 0:06:2,000
heard of Maurice victim uttered these

158
0:06:18.439,000 --> 0:06:22,000
words upon being released he was 78

159
0:06:21.259,000 --> 0:06:24,000
years old he'd spent 37 years in

160
0:06:23.029,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Louisiana State Penitentiary for a crime

161
0:06:24.949,000 --> 0:06:28,000
he didn't commit he was ultimately

162
0:06:26.629,000 --> 0:06:3,000
exonerated at the age of 78 through DNA

163
0:06:29.599,000 --> 0:06:32,000
evidence and what did he have to say

164
0:06:31.309,000 --> 0:06:33,000
about his experience I don't have one

165
0:06:32.659,000 --> 0:06:35,000
minutes regret it was a glorious

166
0:06:33.74,000 --> 0:06:37,000
experience glorious this guy is not

167
0:06:36.409,000 --> 0:06:39,000
saying why are some nice guys there too

168
0:06:38.419,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Jim its glorious a word we usually

169
0:06:40.37,000 --> 0:06:45,000
reserved for something like a religious

170
0:06:42.08,000 --> 0:06:47,000
experience Harriet's Langerman uttered

171
0:06:45.439,000 --> 0:06:47,000
these words and he's somebody you might

172
0:06:47.419,000 --> 0:06:5,000
have known but

173
0:06:48.389,000 --> 0:06:52,000
because in 1949 he read a little article

174
0:06:50.43,000 --> 0:06:53,000
in the paper about a hamburger stand

175
0:06:52.65,000 --> 0:06:55,000
owned by these two brothers named

176
0:06:54.3,000 --> 0:06:57,000
McDonald's and he thought that's a

177
0:06:55.889,000 --> 0:06:59,000
really neat idea so he went to find them

178
0:06:57.9,000 --> 0:07:,000
they said we'd give you a franchise on

179
0:06:59.939,000 --> 0:07:02,000
this for three thousand bucks Harry went

180
0:07:01.56,000 --> 0:07:04,000
back to New York asked his brother who

181
0:07:03.27,000 --> 0:07:06,000
was an investment banker to loan him the

182
0:07:04.949,000 --> 0:07:07,000
three thousand dollars and his brothers

183
0:07:06.36,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and mortal words were you idiot nobody

184
0:07:08.189,000 --> 0:07:11,000
eats hamburgers he wouldn't land in the

185
0:07:09.96,000 --> 0:07:13,000
money and of course six months later Ray

186
0:07:11.819,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Kroc had exactly the same idea it turns

187
0:07:14.099,000 --> 0:07:18,000
out people do eat hamburgers and Ray

188
0:07:16.62,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Kroc for a while became the richest man

189
0:07:18.599,000 --> 0:07:22,000
in America oh and then finally you know

190
0:07:21.569,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the best of all possible worlds some of

191
0:07:23.34,000 --> 0:07:27,000
you recognize this young photo of Pete

192
0:07:25.59,000 --> 0:07:29,000
best who was the original drummer for

193
0:07:27.75,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The Beatles until they you know kind of

194
0:07:30.15,000 --> 0:07:34,000
like sent him out on an errand and snuck

195
0:07:31.71,000 --> 0:07:36,000
away and picked up Ringo on a tour well

196
0:07:34.71,000 --> 0:07:37,000
in 1994 when Pete best was interviewed

197
0:07:36.93,000 --> 0:07:4,000
yes he's still a drummer yes he's a

198
0:07:38.58,000 --> 0:07:42,000
studio musician he this to say I'm

199
0:07:40.949,000 --> 0:07:44,000
happier than I would have been with the

200
0:07:42.629,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Beatles okay there's something important

201
0:07:45.12,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to be learned from these people and it

202
0:07:46.74,000 --> 0:07:49,000
is the secret of happiness here it is

203
0:07:49.02,000 --> 0:07:52,000
finally to be revealed

204
0:07:50.46,000 --> 0:07:57,000
first accrue wealth power and prestige

205
0:07:52.979,000 --> 0:07:57,000
than losing second spend as much of your

206
0:07:57.99,000 --> 0:08:01,000
life in prison

207
0:07:58.8,000 --> 0:08:04,000
as you possibly can third make somebody

208
0:08:02.19,000 --> 0:08:07,000
else really really rich and finally

209
0:08:04.919,000 --> 0:08:12,000
never ever join the Beatles

210
0:08:08.18,000 --> 0:08:15,000
okay no I like zefrank can predict your

211
0:08:13.31,000 --> 0:08:17,000
next thought which is yeah right because

212
0:08:15.86,000 --> 0:08:19,000
when people synthesize happiness is

213
0:08:17.99,000 --> 0:08:21,000
these gentlemen seem to have done we all

214
0:08:20.39,000 --> 0:08:24,000
smile at them but we kind of roll our

215
0:08:22.76,000 --> 0:08:26,000
eyes and say yeah right you never really

216
0:08:25.37,000 --> 0:08:28,000
wanted the job oh yeah right

217
0:08:27.44,000 --> 0:08:3,000
she you really didn't have that much in

218
0:08:29.24,000 --> 0:08:32,000
common with her and you figured that out

219
0:08:30.89,000 --> 0:08:33,000
just about the time she threw the

220
0:08:32.72,000 --> 0:08:35,000
engagement ring in your face

221
0:08:34.25,000 --> 0:08:38,000
we smirk because we believe that

222
0:08:36.65,000 --> 0:08:4,000
synthetic happiness is not of the same

223
0:08:38.9,000 --> 0:08:42,000
quality as what we might call natural

224
0:08:41.09,000 --> 0:08:45,000
happiness what are these terms natural

225
0:08:43.85,000 --> 0:08:47,000
happiness is what we get when we get

226
0:08:45.89,000 --> 0:08:49,000
what we wanted and synthetic happiness

227
0:08:48.11,000 --> 0:08:53,000
is what we make when we don't get what

228
0:08:50.84,000 --> 0:08:55,000
we wanted and in our society we have a

229
0:08:53.51,000 --> 0:08:58,000
strong belief that synthetic happiness

230
0:08:56.21,000 --> 0:09:01,000
is of an inferior kind why do we have

231
0:08:58.55,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that belief well it's very simple what

232
0:09:01.88,000 --> 0:09:06,000
kind of economic engine would keep

233
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
churning if we believe that not getting

234
0:09:07.46,000 --> 0:09:12,000
what we want could make us just as happy

235
0:09:09.59,000 --> 0:09:15,000
as getting it with all apologies to my

236
0:09:13.19,000 --> 0:09:17,000
friend matthieu ricard a shopping mall

237
0:09:15.83,000 --> 0:09:18,000
full of Zen monks is not going to be

238
0:09:18.17,000 --> 0:09:23,000
particularly profitable because they

239
0:09:19.64,000 --> 0:09:25,000
don't want stuff enough I want to

240
0:09:23.48,000 --> 0:09:28,000
suggest to you that synthetic happiness

241
0:09:25.79,000 --> 0:09:3,000
is every bit as real and enduring as the

242
0:09:29.12,000 --> 0:09:32,000
kind of happiness you stumble upon when

243
0:09:31.22,000 --> 0:09:34,000
you get exactly what you were aiming for

244
0:09:32.86,000 --> 0:09:35,000
now in a scientist so I'm gonna do this

245
0:09:35.09,000 --> 0:09:39,000
not with a rhetoric but by marinating

246
0:09:36.77,000 --> 0:09:4,000
you in a little bit of data let me first

247
0:09:39.14,000 --> 0:09:44,000
show you an experimental paradigm that

248
0:09:41.06,000 --> 0:09:46,000
is used to demonstrate the synthesis of

249
0:09:44.27,000 --> 0:09:47,000
happiness among regular old folks and

250
0:09:46.25,000 --> 0:09:49,000
this isn't mine there's a 50 year old

251
0:09:47.69,000 --> 0:09:51,000
paradigm called the free choice paradigm

252
0:09:49.82,000 --> 0:09:54,000
it's very simple you bring in say six

253
0:09:52.49,000 --> 0:09:56,000
objects and you ask a subject to rank

254
0:09:55.55,000 --> 0:09:58,000
them for the most of the least liked in

255
0:09:57.14,000 --> 0:09:59,000
this case because the experiment I'm

256
0:09:58.55,000 --> 0:10:01,000
going to tell you about uses them

257
0:09:59.78,000 --> 0:10:03,000
these are Monet prints so everybody can

258
0:10:02.51,000 --> 0:10:04,000
rank these Monet prints from the one

259
0:10:04.07,000 --> 0:10:07,000
they liked the most to the one they

260
0:10:05.3,000 --> 0:10:09,000
liked the least now we give you a choice

261
0:10:07.43,000 --> 0:10:11,000
we happen to have some extra prints in

262
0:10:10.13,000 --> 0:10:13,000
the closet we're gonna give you one as

263
0:10:11.75,000 --> 0:10:15,000
your prize to take home we happen to

264
0:10:13.73,000 --> 0:10:17,000
have number three and number four we

265
0:10:16.04,000 --> 0:10:19,000
tell the subject there's a bit of a

266
0:10:18.11,000 --> 0:10:21,000
difficult choice because neither one is

267
0:10:19.79,000 --> 0:10:22,000
preferred strongly to the

268
0:10:21.27,000 --> 0:10:25,000
there but naturally people tend to pick

269
0:10:23.43,000 --> 0:10:27,000
number three because they liked it a

270
0:10:25.29,000 --> 0:10:29,000
little better than number four sometime

271
0:10:28.17,000 --> 0:10:32,000
later it could be 15 minutes it could be

272
0:10:29.94,000 --> 0:10:33,000
15 days the same stimuli or put before

273
0:10:32.58,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the subject and the subject is asked to

274
0:10:34.59,000 --> 0:10:37,000
rewrite the stimuli

275
0:10:35.82,000 --> 0:10:39,000
tell us how much you like them now what

276
0:10:38.34,000 --> 0:10:42,000
happens watch as happiness is

277
0:10:40.44,000 --> 0:10:43,000
synthesized this is the result that has

278
0:10:42.39,000 --> 0:10:45,000
been replicated over and over again

279
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
you're watching happiness be synthesized

280
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
would you like to see it again happiness

281
0:10:49.53,000 --> 0:10:52,000
the one I got is really better than I

282
0:10:51.81,000 --> 0:10:53,000
thought that other one I didn't get

283
0:10:53.46,000 --> 0:10:57,000
sucks

284
0:10:54.63,000 --> 0:11:,000
that's the synthesis of happiness now

285
0:10:57.86,000 --> 0:11:04,000
what's the right response to that yeah

286
0:11:01.02,000 --> 0:11:06,000
right now here's the experiment we did

287
0:11:04.95,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and I hope this is gonna convince you

288
0:11:06.75,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that yeah right was not the right

289
0:11:08.28,000 --> 0:11:12,000
response we did this experiment with a

290
0:11:10.95,000 --> 0:11:13,000
group of patients who had antara grade

291
0:11:12.6,000 --> 0:11:16,000
amnesia these are hospitalized patients

292
0:11:14.7,000 --> 0:11:19,000
most of them have korsakoff's syndrome

293
0:11:16.64,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Paulina attic psychosis that they they

294
0:11:20.13,000 --> 0:11:24,000
drank way too much and they can't make

295
0:11:22.47,000 --> 0:11:25,000
new memories okay they remember their

296
0:11:24.54,000 --> 0:11:27,000
childhood but if you walk in and

297
0:11:26.25,000 --> 0:11:29,000
introduce yourself and then leave the

298
0:11:27.84,000 --> 0:11:3,000
room when you come back they don't know

299
0:11:29.79,000 --> 0:11:33,000
who you are

300
0:11:31.07,000 --> 0:11:38,000
we took our Monet prints to the hospital

301
0:11:34.65,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and we asked these patients to rank them

302
0:11:38.64,000 --> 0:11:41,000
from the one they liked the most to the

303
0:11:40.23,000 --> 0:11:44,000
one they liked the least we then gave

304
0:11:42.6,000 --> 0:11:46,000
them the choice between number three and

305
0:11:44.7,000 --> 0:11:48,000
number four like everybody else they

306
0:11:47.1,000 --> 0:11:5,000
said gee thanks doc that's great I can

307
0:11:49.05,000 --> 0:11:54,000
use a new print I'll take number three

308
0:11:50.96,000 --> 0:11:55,000
we explained we would have number three

309
0:11:54.09,000 --> 0:11:58,000
mailed to them we gathered up our

310
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
materials and we went out of the room

311
0:11:58.14,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and counted to a half-hour back into the

312
0:12:01.5,000 --> 0:12:07,000
room we say hi we're back the patients

313
0:12:04.83,000 --> 0:12:09,000
bless them say doc I'm sorry I kind of

314
0:12:08.31,000 --> 0:12:12,000
memory problems one here if I've met you

315
0:12:10.77,000 --> 0:12:13,000
before I don't remember really Jim you

316
0:12:12.36,000 --> 0:12:17,000
don't remember I was just here with the

317
0:12:14.07,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Monet prints sorry doc I just don't have

318
0:12:17.58,000 --> 0:12:21,000
a clue no problem Jim all I want you to

319
0:12:20.22,000 --> 0:12:24,000
do is rank these for me from the one you

320
0:12:22.41,000 --> 0:12:25,000
like the most to the one you like the

321
0:12:24.66,000 --> 0:12:26,000
least

322
0:12:25.47,000 --> 0:12:29,000
what do they do well let's first check

323
0:12:27.42,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and make sure they're really amnesiac we

324
0:12:29.7,000 --> 0:12:34,000
ask these amnesiac patients to tell us

325
0:12:31.77,000 --> 0:12:37,000
which one they own which one they chose

326
0:12:35.67,000 --> 0:12:39,000
which one is theirs and what we find is

327
0:12:38.31,000 --> 0:12:42,000
have music patience just guess these are

328
0:12:40.65,000 --> 0:12:43,000
normal controls with I did this with you

329
0:12:42.63,000 --> 0:12:45,000
all of you would know which print you

330
0:12:44.25,000 --> 0:12:48,000
chose but if I do this with amnesia

331
0:12:46.11,000 --> 0:12:51,000
patients they don't have a clue they

332
0:12:49.08,000 --> 0:12:55,000
can't pick their print out of a lineup

333
0:12:51.92,000 --> 0:12:56,000
here's what normal controls do they

334
0:12:55.32,000 --> 0:12:59,000
synthesize happiness right this is the

335
0:12:57.66,000 --> 0:13:,000
change in liking score the change for

336
0:12:59.67,000 --> 0:13:02,000
the first time they ranked - the second

337
0:13:01.35,000 --> 0:13:04,000
time they're ranked normal controls show

338
0:13:03.54,000 --> 0:13:07,000
that was the magic I showed you now I'm

339
0:13:05.31,000 --> 0:13:09,000
showing it to you in graphical form the

340
0:13:07.62,000 --> 0:13:1,000
one I own is better than I thought the

341
0:13:09.42,000 --> 0:13:14,000
one I didn't own the one I left behind

342
0:13:11.61,000 --> 0:13:17,000
is not as good as I thought and Nix do

343
0:13:15.24,000 --> 0:13:2,000
exactly the same thing think about this

344
0:13:18.09,000 --> 0:13:24,000
result these people liked better the one

345
0:13:20.79,000 --> 0:13:25,000
they own but they don't know they own it

346
0:13:24.74,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Yeah right

347
0:13:26.19,000 --> 0:13:32,000
is not the right response what these

348
0:13:30.21,000 --> 0:13:35,000
people did when they synthesized

349
0:13:32.34,000 --> 0:13:37,000
happiness is they really truly change

350
0:13:35.22,000 --> 0:13:41,000
their affective hedonic aesthetic

351
0:13:38.28,000 --> 0:13:42,000
reactions to that poster they're not

352
0:13:41.31,000 --> 0:13:47,000
just singing it because they own it

353
0:13:43.14,000 --> 0:13:5,000
because they don't know they own it now

354
0:13:47.58,000 --> 0:13:52,000
when psychologists show you bars you

355
0:13:50.88,000 --> 0:13:55,000
know that they are showing you averages

356
0:13:52.59,000 --> 0:13:57,000
of lots of people and yet all of us have

357
0:13:55.98,000 --> 0:13:59,000
this psychological immune system this

358
0:13:57.87,000 --> 0:14:01,000
capacity to synthesize happiness but

359
0:14:00.24,000 --> 0:14:05,000
some of us do this trick better than

360
0:14:02.52,000 --> 0:14:07,000
others and some situations allow anybody

361
0:14:05.34,000 --> 0:14:12,000
to do it more effectively than other

362
0:14:07.83,000 --> 0:14:14,000
situations do it turns out that freedom

363
0:14:13.1,000 --> 0:14:18,000
the ability to make up your mind and

364
0:14:15.51,000 --> 0:14:19,000
change your mind is the friend of

365
0:14:18.39,000 --> 0:14:21,000
natural happiness because it allows you

366
0:14:20.28,000 --> 0:14:24,000
to choose among all those delicious

367
0:14:21.87,000 --> 0:14:26,000
futures that and find the one that you

368
0:14:24.69,000 --> 0:14:28,000
would most enjoy but freedom to choose

369
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:32,000
to change and make up your mind is the

370
0:14:29.55,000 --> 0:14:32,000
enemy of synthetic happiness and I'm

371
0:14:32.22,000 --> 0:14:35,000
gonna show you why

372
0:14:33.18,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Dilbert already knows of course you're

373
0:14:35.28,000 --> 0:14:37,000
reading the cartoon as I'm talking

374
0:14:36.42,000 --> 0:14:4,000
dogbert's tech-support how come eh I

375
0:14:38.13,000 --> 0:14:41,000
abuse you my printer prints a blank page

376
0:14:40.5,000 --> 0:14:43,000
after every document why would you

377
0:14:41.82,000 --> 0:14:45,000
complain about getting free paper freeze

378
0:14:43.74,000 --> 0:14:46,000
the other users giving my own paper egad

379
0:14:45.84,000 --> 0:14:47,000
man look at the quality of the free

380
0:14:47.1,000 --> 0:14:49,000
paper compared to your lousy

381
0:14:48.23,000 --> 0:14:52,000
regular paper only fool or a liar would

382
0:14:49.88,000 --> 0:14:53,000
say that they look the same now that you

383
0:14:52.55,000 --> 0:14:56,000
mention it it does seem a little silkier

384
0:14:54.29,000 --> 0:14:58,000
what are you doing I'm helping people

385
0:14:57.2,000 --> 0:15:01,000
accept the things they cannot change

386
0:14:58.66,000 --> 0:15:04,000
indeed the psychological immune system

387
0:15:02.18,000 --> 0:15:07,000
works best when we are totally stuck

388
0:15:04.91,000 --> 0:15:07,000
when we are trapped this is this is the

389
0:15:07.25,000 --> 0:15:1,000
difference from dating in marriage right

390
0:15:08.75,000 --> 0:15:1,000
I mean you go out on a date with a guy

391
0:15:10.25,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and he picks his nose you don't go out

392
0:15:11.63,000 --> 0:15:15,000
on another date you're married to a guy

393
0:15:13.61,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and he picks his nose you know he has a

394
0:15:15.8,000 --> 0:15:19,000
heart of gold don't touch the fruitcake

395
0:15:17.18,000 --> 0:15:23,000
right you find a way to be happy with

396
0:15:20.45,000 --> 0:15:24,000
what's happened now what I want to show

397
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
you is that people don't know this about

398
0:15:25.4,000 --> 0:15:3,000
themselves and not knowing this can work

399
0:15:27.86,000 --> 0:15:32,000
to our supreme disadvantage here's an

400
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
experiment we did it Harvard we created

401
0:15:32.93,000 --> 0:15:35,000
a photography course a black-and-white

402
0:15:34.61,000 --> 0:15:37,000
photography course and we allowed

403
0:15:36.44,000 --> 0:15:4,000
students to come in and learn how to use

404
0:15:37.79,000 --> 0:15:41,000
a darkroom so we gave them cameras they

405
0:15:40.61,000 --> 0:15:43,000
went around campus they took 12 pictures

406
0:15:42.29,000 --> 0:15:45,000
of their favorite professors in their

407
0:15:44.15,000 --> 0:15:47,000
dorm room and their you know their dog

408
0:15:46.1,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and all the other things they wanted to

409
0:15:47.3,000 --> 0:15:5,000
have Harvard memories of they bring us

410
0:15:49.79,000 --> 0:15:52,000
the camera we make up a contact sheet

411
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
they figure out which are the two best

412
0:15:53.03,000 --> 0:15:56,000
pictures and we now spend six hours

413
0:15:54.62,000 --> 0:15:57,000
teaching them about dark rooms and they

414
0:15:56.45,000 --> 0:15:59,000
blow two of them up and they have two

415
0:15:58.13,000 --> 0:16:01,000
gorgeous eight-by-ten glossies of

416
0:15:59.78,000 --> 0:16:03,000
meaningful things to them and we say

417
0:16:01.37,000 --> 0:16:05,000
which one would you like to give up I

418
0:16:04.43,000 --> 0:16:08,000
have to give one up oh yes we need one

419
0:16:06.23,000 --> 0:16:1,000
is evidence of the class project so you

420
0:16:09.11,000 --> 0:16:13,000
have to give me one you have to make a

421
0:16:10.82,000 --> 0:16:15,000
choice you get to keep one and I get to

422
0:16:13.7,000 --> 0:16:18,000
keep one now there are two conditions in

423
0:16:16.64,000 --> 0:16:2,000
this experiment in one case the students

424
0:16:18.8,000 --> 0:16:21,000
are told but you know if you want to

425
0:16:20.75,000 --> 0:16:24,000
change your mind I'll always have the

426
0:16:22.4,000 --> 0:16:26,000
other one here and in the next four days

427
0:16:25.4,000 --> 0:16:29,000
before I actually mail it to

428
0:16:26.81,000 --> 0:16:32,000
headquarters I'd be glad to headquarters

429
0:16:30.32,000 --> 0:16:34,000
I'll be glad to swap it out with you in

430
0:16:32.99,000 --> 0:16:35,000
fact I'll come to your dorm room and

431
0:16:34.85,000 --> 0:16:37,000
give just give me an email better yet

432
0:16:36.59,000 --> 0:16:4,000
I'll check with you you ever want to

433
0:16:38.84,000 --> 0:16:41,000
change your mind it's totally returnable

434
0:16:40.7,000 --> 0:16:43,000
the other half of the students are told

435
0:16:42.32,000 --> 0:16:46,000
exactly the opposite make your choice

436
0:16:44.69,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and by the way the mail is going out

437
0:16:46.82,000 --> 0:16:49,000
gosh in two minutes to England your

438
0:16:48.98,000 --> 0:16:51,000
picture will be winging its way over the

439
0:16:50.51,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Atlantic you will never see it again

440
0:16:52.52,000 --> 0:16:56,000
now half of the students in each of

441
0:16:55.31,000 --> 0:16:58,000
these conditions are asked to make

442
0:16:56.78,000 --> 0:16:58,000
predictions about how much they're going

443
0:16:58.52,000 --> 0:17:,000
to come to

444
0:16:59.46,000 --> 0:17:03,000
the picture that they keep in the

445
0:17:01.29,000 --> 0:17:04,000
picture they leave behind other students

446
0:17:03.63,000 --> 0:17:06,000
are just sent back to their little dorm

447
0:17:05.13,000 --> 0:17:11,000
rooms and they are measured over the

448
0:17:07.38,000 --> 0:17:12,000
next 6 to 3 to 6 days on their liking

449
0:17:11.22,000 --> 0:17:14,000
satisfaction with the pictures and look

450
0:17:12.63,000 --> 0:17:16,000
at what we find first of all here's what

451
0:17:14.699,000 --> 0:17:18,000
students think is going to happen they

452
0:17:17.37,000 --> 0:17:21,000
think they're gonna maybe come to like

453
0:17:19.079,000 --> 0:17:24,000
the picture they chose a little more

454
0:17:21.689,000 --> 0:17:25,000
than the one they left behind but these

455
0:17:24.6,000 --> 0:17:27,000
are not statistically significant

456
0:17:26.069,000 --> 0:17:29,000
differences it really it's this very

457
0:17:27.72,000 --> 0:17:3,000
small increase and it doesn't much

458
0:17:29.49,000 --> 0:17:32,000
matter whether they were in the

459
0:17:31.14,000 --> 0:17:36,000
reversible or irreversible condition

460
0:17:32.64,000 --> 0:17:37,000
wrong Oh bad simulators because here's

461
0:17:36.179,000 --> 0:17:4,000
what's really happening both right

462
0:17:38.25,000 --> 0:17:42,000
before the swap and five days later

463
0:17:40.34,000 --> 0:17:44,000
people who are stuck with that picture

464
0:17:43.11,000 --> 0:17:49,000
who have no choice who can never change

465
0:17:44.79,000 --> 0:17:5,000
their mind liked it a lot and people who

466
0:17:49.32,000 --> 0:17:52,000
are deliberating should I return it have

467
0:17:51.75,000 --> 0:17:53,000
I gotten the right one maybe this isn't

468
0:17:53.1,000 --> 0:17:56,000
the good one maybe I left the good one

469
0:17:54.54,000 --> 0:17:58,000
have killed themselves they don't like

470
0:17:56.94,000 --> 0:17:59,000
their picture and in fact even after the

471
0:17:58.59,000 --> 0:18:03,000
opportunity to swap has expired they

472
0:18:00.36,000 --> 0:18:06,000
still don't like their picture why

473
0:18:04.05,000 --> 0:18:09,000
because the irreversible condition is

474
0:18:07.32,000 --> 0:18:12,000
not conducive to the synthesis of

475
0:18:09.24,000 --> 0:18:14,000
happiness so here's the final piece of

476
0:18:12.51,000 --> 0:18:17,000
this experiment we bring in a whole new

477
0:18:14.7,000 --> 0:18:19,000
group of naive Harvard students and we

478
0:18:17.64,000 --> 0:18:21,000
say you know we're doing a photography

479
0:18:20.04,000 --> 0:18:24,000
course and we can do it one of two ways

480
0:18:22.34,000 --> 0:18:26,000
we could do it so that when you take the

481
0:18:24.54,000 --> 0:18:27,000
two pictures you'd have four days to

482
0:18:26.4,000 --> 0:18:29,000
change your mind oh we're doing another

483
0:18:28.17,000 --> 0:18:31,000
course where you take the two pictures

484
0:18:29.7,000 --> 0:18:32,000
and you make up your mind right away and

485
0:18:31.47,000 --> 0:18:35,000
you can never change it which course

486
0:18:32.76,000 --> 0:18:37,000
would you like to be in sixty-six

487
0:18:36.24,000 --> 0:18:4,000
percent of the students two-thirds

488
0:18:38.1,000 --> 0:18:41,000
prefer to be in the course where they

489
0:18:40.44,000 --> 0:18:43,000
have the opportunity to change their

490
0:18:41.94,000 --> 0:18:45,000
mind hello sixty-six percent of the

491
0:18:44.37,000 --> 0:18:47,000
students choose to be in the course in

492
0:18:46.05,000 --> 0:18:5,000
which they will ultimately be deeply

493
0:18:47.85,000 --> 0:18:52,000
dissatisfied with the picture because

494
0:18:50.88,000 --> 0:18:56,000
they do not know the conditions under

495
0:18:53.429,000 --> 0:19:,000
which synthetic happiness grows the Bard

496
0:18:57.84,000 --> 0:19:02,000
said everything best of course and he's

497
0:19:00.6,000 --> 0:19:05,000
making my point here but he's making it

498
0:19:03.45,000 --> 0:19:06,000
hyperbolically it is nothing good or bad

499
0:19:05.61,000 --> 0:19:09,000
but thinking makes it so

500
0:19:07.02,000 --> 0:19:12,000
it's nice poetry but that can't exist

501
0:19:09.98,000 --> 0:19:13,000
we be right is there really nothing good

502
0:19:12.32,000 --> 0:19:16,000
or bad is it really the case that

503
0:19:14.21,000 --> 0:19:19,000
gallbladder surgery and a trip to Paris

504
0:19:16.94,000 --> 0:19:22,000
are just the same thing yeah there that

505
0:19:20.09,000 --> 0:19:25,000
seems like a one-question IQ test

506
0:19:23.21,000 --> 0:19:28,000
they can't be exactly the same in more

507
0:19:25.88,000 --> 0:19:29,000
turgid pros but closer to the truth was

508
0:19:28.7,000 --> 0:19:32,000
the father of modern capitalism Adam

509
0:19:30.769,000 --> 0:19:34,000
Smith and he said this this is worth

510
0:19:32.779,000 --> 0:19:36,000
contemplating the great source of both

511
0:19:35.269,000 --> 0:19:39,000
the misery and disorders of human life

512
0:19:37.279,000 --> 0:19:41,000
seems to arise from overrating the

513
0:19:40.1,000 --> 0:19:44,000
difference between one permanent

514
0:19:41.779,000 --> 0:19:45,000
situation and another some of these

515
0:19:44.21,000 --> 0:19:49,000
situations may no doubt deserve to be

516
0:19:46.7,000 --> 0:19:52,000
preferred to others but none of them can

517
0:19:50.09,000 --> 0:19:56,000
be desert none of them can deserve to be

518
0:19:53.45,000 --> 0:19:58,000
pursued with that passionate ardor which

519
0:19:56.51,000 --> 0:20:01,000
drives us to violate the rules either of

520
0:19:59.24,000 --> 0:20:03,000
prudence or of justice or to corrupt the

521
0:20:02.24,000 --> 0:20:06,000
future tranquillity of our minds either

522
0:20:04.22,000 --> 0:20:09,000
by shame from the remembrance of our own

523
0:20:06.649,000 --> 0:20:12,000
folly or by remorse for the horror of

524
0:20:09.919,000 --> 0:20:15,000
our own injustice in other words yes

525
0:20:13.19,000 --> 0:20:18,000
some things are better than others we

526
0:20:16.7,000 --> 0:20:21,000
should have preferences that lead us

527
0:20:19.07,000 --> 0:20:24,000
into one future over another but when

528
0:20:22.519,000 --> 0:20:26,000
those preferences drive us too hard and

529
0:20:24.919,000 --> 0:20:29,000
too fast because we have overrated the

530
0:20:27.409,000 --> 0:20:33,000
difference between these futures we are

531
0:20:30.11,000 --> 0:20:36,000
at risk when our ambition is bounded it

532
0:20:34.159,000 --> 0:20:38,000
leads us to work joyfully when our

533
0:20:36.2,000 --> 0:20:42,000
ambition is unbounded it leads us to lie

534
0:20:38.69,000 --> 0:20:43,000
to cheat to steal to hurt others to

535
0:20:42.38,000 --> 0:20:47,000
sacrifice things of real value when our

536
0:20:44.57,000 --> 0:20:47,000
fears are bounded we're prudent we're

537
0:20:47.45,000 --> 0:20:49,000
cautious

538
0:20:48.139,000 --> 0:20:53,000
we're thoughtful when our fears are

539
0:20:49.97,000 --> 0:20:55,000
unbounded and overblown we're reckless

540
0:20:53.389,000 --> 0:20:58,000
and we're cowardly the lesson I want to

541
0:20:56.69,000 --> 0:21:01,000
leave you with from these data is that

542
0:20:59.33,000 --> 0:21:03,000
our longings and our worries are both to

543
0:21:01.73,000 --> 0:21:06,000
some degree overblown because we have

544
0:21:03.95,000 --> 0:21:09,000
within us the capacity to manufacture

545
0:21:06.94,000 --> 0:21:13,000
the very commodity we are constantly

546
0:21:10.399,000 --> 0:21:14,000
chasing when we choose experience thank

547
0:21:14.059,000 --> 0:21:17,000
you

548
0:21:15.309,000 --> 0:21:17,000
you

1
0:00:12.262,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'd like you to take a moment

2
0:00:13.736,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and consider what you are wearing right now.

3
0:00:17.675,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I have a deep, philosophical question for you.

4
0:00:21.079,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Why are we not all wearing comfortable pajamas right now?

5
0:00:23.785,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:24.809,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Well, I'm a psychologist and not a mind reader,

7
0:00:27.371,000 --> 0:00:29,000
although many people think that's the same thing.

8
0:00:30.069,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I can bet you that your response is somewhere along the lines of,

9
0:00:33.76,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"I'm expected to not wear pj's in public"

10
0:00:36.458,000 --> 0:00:38,000
or "I don't want people to think I am a slob."

11
0:00:39.665,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Either way, the fact that we all chose to wear business casual clothing,

12
0:00:43.74,000 --> 0:00:45,000
as opposed to our favorite pair of sweatpants,

13
0:00:45.915,000 --> 0:00:46,000
is not a silly coincidence.

14
0:00:48.311,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Instead, it reveals two defining human characteristics.

15
0:00:52.704,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The first is that we are cognizant of what other people value,

16
0:00:56.323,000 --> 0:00:58,000
like what they will approve or disapprove of,

17
0:00:58.974,000 --> 0:01:01,000
such as not wearing pj's to these sorts of settings.

18
0:01:02.49,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And two, we've readily used this information to guide our behavior.

19
0:01:07.149,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Unlike many other species,

20
0:01:08.872,000 --> 0:01:12,000
humans are prone to tailor their behavior in the presence of others

21
0:01:12.936,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to garner approval.

22
0:01:14.766,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We spend valuable time putting on make up,

23
0:01:17.108,000 --> 0:01:19,000
choosing the right picture and Instagram filter,

24
0:01:20.036,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and composing ideas that will undoubtedly change the world

25
0:01:22.822,000 --> 0:01:23,000
in 140 characters or less.

26
0:01:25.561,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Clearly, our concern with how other people will evaluate us

27
0:01:28.609,000 --> 0:01:29,000
is a big part of being human.

28
0:01:31.53,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Despite this being a big human trait, however,

29
0:01:34.244,000 --> 0:01:36,000
we know relatively little about when and how

30
0:01:37.038,000 --> 0:01:39,000
we come to care about the opinion of others.

31
0:01:39.649,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Now, this is a big question that requires many studies.

32
0:01:43.269,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But the first step to uncovering this question

33
0:01:45.594,000 --> 0:01:47,000
is to investigate when in development

34
0:01:47.793,000 --> 0:01:49,000
we become sensitive to others' evaluations.

35
0:01:51.245,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I have spent the past four years at Emory University

36
0:01:54.149,000 --> 0:01:56,000
investigating how an infant,

37
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
who has no problem walking around the grocery store in her onesie,

38
0:02:00.57,000 --> 0:02:02,000
develops into an adult that fears public speaking

39
0:02:03.445,000 --> 0:02:05,000
for fear of being negatively judged.

40
0:02:06.472,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:08.133,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now, this is usually a point when people ask me,

42
0:02:10.498,000 --> 0:02:12,000
"How do you investigate this question, exactly?

43
0:02:13.101,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Infants can't talk, right?"

44
0:02:15.53,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Well, if my husband were up here right now,

45
0:02:17.704,000 --> 0:02:19,000
he would tell you that I interview babies,

46
0:02:20.395,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because he would rather not say that his wife experiments on children.

47
0:02:24.851,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:27.427,000 --> 0:02:3,000
In reality, I design experiments for children,

49
0:02:30.682,000 --> 0:02:31,000
usually in the form of games.

50
0:02:33.269,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Developmental psychologist Dr. Philippe Rochat and I

51
0:02:36.038,000 --> 0:02:39,000
designed a "game" called "The Robot Task"

52
0:02:39.173,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to explore when children would begin to be sensitive

53
0:02:41.84,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to the evaluation of others.

54
0:02:44.442,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Specifically, the robot task captures when children, like adults,

55
0:02:48.958,000 --> 0:02:51,000
strategically modify their behavior when others are watching.

56
0:02:53.03,000 --> 0:02:56,000
To do this, we showed 14 to 24-month-old infants

57
0:02:56.268,000 --> 0:02:58,000
how to activate a toy robot,

58
0:02:58.467,000 --> 0:03:,000
and importantly, we either assigned a positive value,

59
0:03:00.974,000 --> 0:03:02,000
saying "Wow, isn't that great!"

60
0:03:03.244,000 --> 0:03:05,000
or a negative value, saying, "Oh, oh. Oops, oh no,"

61
0:03:05.942,000 --> 0:03:06,000
after pressing the remote.

62
0:03:08.22,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Following this toy demonstration,

63
0:03:09.821,000 --> 0:03:11,000
we invited the infants to play with the remote,

64
0:03:12.393,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and then either watched them

65
0:03:13.839,000 --> 0:03:15,000
or turned around and pretended to read a magazine.

66
0:03:17.212,000 --> 0:03:19,000
The idea was that if by 24 months,

67
0:03:19.665,000 --> 0:03:22,000
children are indeed sensitive to the evaluation of others,

68
0:03:22.966,000 --> 0:03:24,000
then their button-pressing behavior should be influenced

69
0:03:25.665,000 --> 0:03:27,000
not only by whether or not they're being watched

70
0:03:28.07,000 --> 0:03:3,000
but also by the values that the experimenter expressed

71
0:03:30.784,000 --> 0:03:31,000
towards pressing the remote.

72
0:03:33.173,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So for example,

73
0:03:34.403,000 --> 0:03:37,000
we would expect children to play with the positive remote significantly more

74
0:03:38.055,000 --> 0:03:39,000
if they were being observed

75
0:03:39.444,000 --> 0:03:41,000
but then choose to explore the negative remote

76
0:03:41.611,000 --> 0:03:42,000
once no one was watching.

77
0:03:43.952,000 --> 0:03:46,000
To really capture this phenomenon, we did three variations of the study.

78
0:03:47.871,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Study one explored how infants would engage with a novel toy

79
0:03:51.244,000 --> 0:03:53,000
if there were no values or instructions provided.

80
0:03:53.871,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So we simply showed infants how to activate the toy robot,

81
0:03:56.625,000 --> 0:03:57,000
but didn't assign any values,

82
0:03:58.236,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and we also didn't tell them that they could play with the remote,

83
0:04:01.371,000 --> 0:04:03,000
providing them with a really ambiguous situation.

84
0:04:03.958,000 --> 0:04:04,000
In study two,

85
0:04:05.165,000 --> 0:04:09,000
we incorporated the two values, a positive and a negative.

86
0:04:10.609,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And in the last study, we had two experimenters and one remote.

87
0:04:14.196,000 --> 0:04:17,000
One experimenter expressed a negative value towards pressing the remote,

88
0:04:17.649,000 --> 0:04:18,000
saying, "Yuck, the toy moved,"

89
0:04:19.18,000 --> 0:04:22,000
while the other experimenter expressed a positive value, saying,

90
0:04:22.221,000 --> 0:04:23,000
"Yay, the toy moved."

91
0:04:23.927,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And this is how the children reacted to these three different scenarios.

92
0:04:27.482,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So in study one, the ambiguous situation,

93
0:04:30.346,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I'm currently watching the child.

94
0:04:32.781,000 --> 0:04:34,000
She doesn't seem to be too interested in pressing the remote.

95
0:04:36.622,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Once I turned around --

96
0:04:39.061,000 --> 0:04:4,000
now she's ready to play.

97
0:04:40.696,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:43.903,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Currently, I'm not watching the child.

99
0:04:45.837,000 --> 0:04:46,000
She's really focused.

100
0:04:47.012,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I turn around.

101
0:04:49.588,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:50.644,000 --> 0:04:52,000
She wasn't doing anything, right?

103
0:04:55.596,000 --> 0:04:56,000
In study two, it's the two remotes,

104
0:04:57.371,000 --> 0:04:59,000
one with the positive and one with the negative value.

105
0:04:59.942,000 --> 0:05:,000
I'm currently observing the child.

106
0:05:01.633,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And the orange remote is a negative remote.

107
0:05:05.259,000 --> 0:05:07,000
She's just looking around, looking at me, hanging out.

108
0:05:08.494,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Then I turn around ...

109
0:05:12.081,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Laughter)

110
0:05:15.072,000 --> 0:05:16,000
That's what she's going for.

111
0:05:19.875,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I'm not watching the child.

112
0:05:21.436,000 --> 0:05:23,000
He wants the mom to play with it, right?

113
0:05:23.704,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Take a safer route.

114
0:05:25.736,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I turn around ...

115
0:05:28.093,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:29.784,000 --> 0:05:31,000
He wasn't doing anything, either.

117
0:05:36.371,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Yeah, he feels awkward.

118
0:05:37.927,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

119
0:05:38.958,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Everyone knows that side-eyed glance, right?

120
0:05:41.807,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Study three, the two experimenters, one remote.

121
0:05:44.292,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The experimenter that reacted negatively towards pressing the remote

122
0:05:47.577,000 --> 0:05:48,000
is watching the child right now.

123
0:05:49.228,000 --> 0:05:53,000
She feels a little awkward, doesn't know what to do, relying on Mom.

124
0:05:56.307,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And then, she's going to turn around

125
0:05:58.752,000 --> 0:06:01,000
so that the experimenter that expressed a positive response is watching.

126
0:06:04.109,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Coast is clear -- now she's ready to play.

127
0:06:06.363,000 --> 0:06:07,000
(Laughter)

128
0:06:07.45,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So, as the data suggests,

129
0:06:09.379,000 --> 0:06:11,000
we found that children's button-pressing behavior

130
0:06:11.736,000 --> 0:06:15,000
was indeed influenced by the values and the instructions of the experimenter.

131
0:06:16.934,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Because in study one, children did not know

132
0:06:19.499,000 --> 0:06:21,000
what would be positively or negatively evaluated,

133
0:06:22.411,000 --> 0:06:23,000
they tended to take the safest route

134
0:06:24.379,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and wait until I turned my back to press the remote.

135
0:06:27.083,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Children in study two

136
0:06:28.495,000 --> 0:06:31,000
chose to press the positive remote significantly more when I was watching,

137
0:06:32.321,000 --> 0:06:33,000
but then once I turned my back,

138
0:06:33.916,000 --> 0:06:36,000
they immediately took the negative remote and started playing with it.

139
0:06:37.363,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Importantly, in a control study,

140
0:06:38.977,000 --> 0:06:4,000
where we removed the different values of the remotes --

141
0:06:41.942,000 --> 0:06:44,000
so we simply said, "Oh, wow" after pressing either of the remotes --

142
0:06:45.204,000 --> 0:06:48,000
children's button-pressing behavior no longer differed across conditions,

143
0:06:48.679,000 --> 0:06:51,000
suggesting that it was really the values that we gave the two remotes

144
0:06:52.434,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that drove the behavior in the previous study.

145
0:06:55.188,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Last but not least,

146
0:06:56.38,000 --> 0:06:59,000
children in study three chose to press a remote significantly more

147
0:07:00.204,000 --> 0:07:03,000
when the experimenter that expressed a positive value was watching,

148
0:07:03.538,000 --> 0:07:06,000
as opposed to the experimenter that had expressed a negative value.

149
0:07:07.553,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Not coincidentally,

150
0:07:08.855,000 --> 0:07:11,000
it is also around this age that children begin to show embarrassment

151
0:07:12.522,000 --> 0:07:14,000
in situations that might elicit a negative evaluation,

152
0:07:15.539,000 --> 0:07:17,000
such as looking at themselves in the mirror

153
0:07:17.57,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and noticing a mark on their nose.

154
0:07:19.245,000 --> 0:07:21,000
The equivalent of finding spinach in your teeth, for adults.

155
0:07:22.079,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

156
0:07:23.277,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So what can we say, based on these findings?

157
0:07:26.349,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Besides the fact that babies are actually really, really sneaky.

158
0:07:29.825,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Laughter)

159
0:07:30.905,000 --> 0:07:33,000
From very early on, children, like adults,

160
0:07:34.222,000 --> 0:07:37,000
are sensitive to the values that we place on objects and behaviors.

161
0:07:38.354,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And importantly, they use these values to guide their behavior.

162
0:07:42.425,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Whether we're aware of it or not,

163
0:07:44.156,000 --> 0:07:47,000
we're constantly communicating values to those around us.

164
0:07:47.522,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Now, I don't mean values like "be kind" or "don't steal,"

165
0:07:51.03,000 --> 0:07:53,000
although those are certainly values.

166
0:07:53.45,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I mean that we are constantly showing others, specifically our children,

167
0:07:57.077,000 --> 0:08:,000
what is likeable, valuable and praiseworthy, and what is not.

168
0:08:01.307,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And a lot of the times,

169
0:08:02.507,000 --> 0:08:04,000
we actually do this without even noticing it.

170
0:08:05.601,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Psychologists study behavior to explore the contents of the mind,

171
0:08:09.473,000 --> 0:08:11,000
because our behavior often reflects our beliefs,

172
0:08:12.427,000 --> 0:08:14,000
our values and our desires.

173
0:08:15.471,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Here in Atlanta, we all believe the same thing.

174
0:08:18.963,000 --> 0:08:19,000
That Coke is better than Pepsi.

175
0:08:20.725,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Applause)

176
0:08:22.543,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Now, this might have to do with the fact that Coke was invented in Atlanta.

177
0:08:27.307,000 --> 0:08:28,000
But regardless,

178
0:08:28.505,000 --> 0:08:32,000
this belief is expressed in the fact that most people will chose to drink Coke.

179
0:08:33.323,000 --> 0:08:34,000
In the same way,

180
0:08:34.719,000 --> 0:08:35,000
we are communicating a value

181
0:08:36.611,000 --> 0:08:37,000
when we mostly complement girls

182
0:08:38.158,000 --> 0:08:4,000
for their pretty hair or their pretty dress,

183
0:08:40.688,000 --> 0:08:42,000
but boys, for their intelligence.

184
0:08:43.101,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Or when we chose to offer candy, as opposed to nutritious food,

185
0:08:46.868,000 --> 0:08:48,000
as a reward for good behavior.

186
0:08:49.466,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Adults and children are incredibly effective

187
0:08:52.232,000 --> 0:08:54,000
at picking up values from these subtle behaviors.

188
0:08:55.061,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And in turn, this ends up shaping their own behavior.

189
0:08:59.196,000 --> 0:09:01,000
The research I have shared with you today

190
0:09:01.458,000 --> 0:09:04,000
suggests that this ability emerges very early in development,

191
0:09:05.022,000 --> 0:09:07,000
before we can even utter a complete sentence

192
0:09:07.101,000 --> 0:09:08,000
or are even potty-trained.

193
0:09:09.014,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And it becomes an integral part of who we grow up to be.

194
0:09:12.942,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So before I go,

195
0:09:14.522,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I'd like to invite you to contemplate on the values

196
0:09:17.419,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that we broadcast in day-to-day interactions,

197
0:09:20.125,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and how these values might be shaping the behavior of those around you.

198
0:09:24.222,000 --> 0:09:27,000
For example, what value is being broadcasted

199
0:09:27.321,000 --> 0:09:29,000
when we spend more time smiling at our phone

200
0:09:30.088,000 --> 0:09:31,000
than smiling with other people?

201
0:09:32.683,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Likewise, consider how your own behavior has been shaped by those around you,

202
0:09:36.662,000 --> 0:09:38,000
in ways you might not have considered before.

203
0:09:39.543,000 --> 0:09:41,000
To go back to our simple illustration,

204
0:09:41.654,000 --> 0:09:43,000
do you really prefer Coke over Pepsi?

205
0:09:44.05,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Or was this preference simply driven by what others around you valued?

206
0:09:48.461,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Parents and teachers certainly have the privilege

207
0:09:51.239,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to shape children's behavior.

208
0:09:53.977,000 --> 0:09:55,000
But it is important to remember

209
0:09:56.192,000 --> 0:10:,000
that through the values we convey in simple day-to-day interactions,

210
0:10:00.475,000 --> 0:10:03,000
we all have the power to shape the behavior of those around us.

211
0:10:04.451,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Thank you.

212
0:10:05.626,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Applause)

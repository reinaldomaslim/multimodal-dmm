1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
How do you explain when things don't go as we assume?

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Or better, how do you explain

3
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions?

4
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
For example:

5
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Why is Apple so innovative?

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Year after year, after year,

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
they're more innovative than all their competition.

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And yet, they're just a computer company.

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
They're just like everyone else.

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
They have the same access to the same talent,

11
0:00:42.474,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the same agencies,

12
0:00:43.499,000 --> 0:00:44,000
the same consultants, the same media.

13
0:00:45.379,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Then why is it that they seem to have something different?

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement?

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
He wasn't the only man who suffered in pre-civil rights America,

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
and he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day.

17
0:01:01.029,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Why him?

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And why is it that the Wright brothers

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
were able to figure out controlled, powered man flight

20
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
when there were certainly other teams

21
0:01:10.434,000 --> 0:01:12,000
who were better qualified, better funded --

22
0:01:13.331,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and they didn't achieve powered man flight,

23
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and the Wright brothers beat them to it.

24
0:01:18.259,000 --> 0:01:19,000
There's something else at play here.

25
0:01:21.385,000 --> 0:01:24,000
About three and a half years ago, I made a discovery.

26
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked,

27
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it.

28
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
As it turns out, there's a pattern.

29
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
As it turns out, all the great inspiring leaders and organizations in the world,

30
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
whether it's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers,

31
0:01:47.299,000 --> 0:01:5,000
they all think, act and communicate the exact same way.

32
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And it's the complete opposite to everyone else.

33
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
All I did was codify it,

34
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
and it's probably the world's simplest idea.

35
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I call it the golden circle.

36
0:02:11.556,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Why? How? What?

37
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This little idea explains

38
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't.

39
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Let me define the terms really quickly.

40
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Every single person, every single organization on the planet

41
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
knows what they do, 100 percent.

42
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Some know how they do it,

43
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
whether you call it your differentiated value proposition

44
0:02:33.968,000 --> 0:02:35,000
or your proprietary process or your USP.

45
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But very, very few people or organizations know why they do what they do.

46
0:02:41.031,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And by "why" I don't mean "to make a profit."

47
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
That's a result. It's always a result.

48
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
By "why," I mean: What's your purpose?

49
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
What's your cause? What's your belief?

50
0:02:49.723,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Why does your organization exist?

51
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Why do you get out of bed in the morning?

52
0:02:55.652,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And why should anyone care?

53
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
As a result, the way we think, we act,

54
0:03:00.189,000 --> 0:03:02,000
the way we communicate is from the outside in, it's obvious.

55
0:03:03.029,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing.

56
0:03:05.744,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations --

57
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
regardless of their size, regardless of their industry --

58
0:03:12.879,000 --> 0:03:15,000
all think, act and communicate from the inside out.

59
0:03:17.807,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Let me give you an example.

60
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I use Apple because they're easy to understand and everybody gets it.

61
0:03:22.672,000 --> 0:03:24,000
If Apple were like everyone else,

62
0:03:25.267,000 --> 0:03:28,000
a marketing message from them might sound like this:

63
0:03:28.771,000 --> 0:03:29,000
"We make great computers.

64
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
They're beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly.

65
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Want to buy one?"

66
0:03:37.454,000 --> 0:03:38,000
"Meh."

67
0:03:38.479,000 --> 0:03:39,000
That's how most of us communicate.

68
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
That's how most marketing and sales are done,

69
0:03:42.772,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that's how we communicate interpersonally.

70
0:03:44.891,000 --> 0:03:45,000
We say what we do,

71
0:03:46.686,000 --> 0:03:47,000
we say how we're different or better

72
0:03:48.479,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and we expect some sort of a behavior,

73
0:03:50.36,000 --> 0:03:51,000
a purchase, a vote, something like that.

74
0:03:52.36,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Here's our new law firm:

75
0:03:53.66,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients,

76
0:03:56.106,000 --> 0:03:57,000
we always perform for our clients.

77
0:03:57.752,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Here's our new car:

78
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It gets great gas mileage, it has leather seats.

79
0:04:01.916,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Buy our car.

80
0:04:03.129,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But it's uninspiring.

81
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Here's how Apple actually communicates.

82
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
"Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo.

83
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We believe in thinking differently.

84
0:04:16.93,000 --> 0:04:17,000
The way we challenge the status quo

85
0:04:18.715,000 --> 0:04:2,000
is by making our products beautifully designed,

86
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
simple to use and user friendly.

87
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
We just happen to make great computers.

88
0:04:25.923,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Want to buy one?"

89
0:04:28.152,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Totally different, right?

90
0:04:29.479,000 --> 0:04:3,000
You're ready to buy a computer from me.

91
0:04:31.46,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I just reversed the order of the information.

92
0:04:33.682,000 --> 0:04:36,000
What it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do;

93
0:04:37.578,000 --> 0:04:39,000
people buy why you do it.

94
0:04:40.007,000 --> 0:04:44,000
This explains why every single person in this room

95
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple.

96
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
But we're also perfectly comfortable

97
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
buying an MP3 player from Apple, or a phone from Apple,

98
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
or a DVR from Apple.

99
0:04:54.261,000 --> 0:04:56,000
As I said before, Apple's just a computer company.

100
0:04:56.812,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Nothing distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors.

101
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products.

102
0:05:03.732,000 --> 0:05:04,000
In fact, they tried.

103
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
A few years ago, Gateway came out with flat-screen TVs.

104
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
They're eminently qualified to make flat-screen TVs.

105
0:05:10.713,000 --> 0:05:12,000
They've been making flat-screen monitors for years.

106
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Nobody bought one.

107
0:05:17.917,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs,

108
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and they make great quality products,

109
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and they can make perfectly well-designed products --

110
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and nobody bought one.

111
0:05:30.084,000 --> 0:05:32,000
In fact, talking about it now, we can't even imagine

112
0:05:32.56,000 --> 0:05:33,000
buying an MP3 player from Dell.

113
0:05:34.132,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Why would you buy one from a computer company?

114
0:05:36.36,000 --> 0:05:37,000
But we do it every day.

115
0:05:37.981,000 --> 0:05:39,000
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.

116
0:05:40.496,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have.

117
0:05:46.045,000 --> 0:05:5,000
The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe.

118
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Here's the best part:

119
0:05:52.911,000 --> 0:05:54,000
None of what I'm telling you is my opinion.

120
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It's all grounded in the tenets of biology.

121
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Not psychology, biology.

122
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
If you look at a cross-section of the human brain,

123
0:06:03.023,000 --> 0:06:05,000
from the top down, the human brain is actually broken

124
0:06:05.68,000 --> 0:06:06,000
into three major components

125
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that correlate perfectly with the golden circle.

126
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain,

127
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
our neocortex,

128
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
corresponds with the "what" level.

129
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The neocortex is responsible

130
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
for all of our rational and analytical thought and language.

131
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The middle two sections make up our limbic brains,

132
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings,

133
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
like trust and loyalty.

134
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It's also responsible for all human behavior,

135
0:06:34.427,000 --> 0:06:35,000
all decision-making,

136
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and it has no capacity for language.

137
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
In other words, when we communicate from the outside in,

138
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
yes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated information

139
0:06:45.427,000 --> 0:06:47,000
like features and benefits and facts and figures.

140
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It just doesn't drive behavior.

141
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
When we can communicate from the inside out,

142
0:06:52.38,000 --> 0:06:54,000
we're talking directly to the part of the brain

143
0:06:54.643,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that controls behavior,

144
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do.

145
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
This is where gut decisions come from.

146
0:07:02.834,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures,

147
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and they say, "I know what all the facts and details say,

148
0:07:09.006,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but it just doesn't feel right."

149
0:07:10.56,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Why would we use that verb, it doesn't "feel" right?

150
0:07:13.124,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Because the part of the brain that controls decision-making

151
0:07:15.923,000 --> 0:07:16,000
doesn't control language.

152
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
The best we can muster up is,

153
0:07:18.745,000 --> 0:07:2,000
"I don't know. It just doesn't feel right."

154
0:07:20.822,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Or sometimes you say you're leading with your heart or soul.

155
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I hate to break it to you, those aren't other body parts

156
0:07:26.956,000 --> 0:07:27,000
controlling your behavior.

157
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It's all happening here in your limbic brain,

158
0:07:30.427,000 --> 0:07:33,000
the part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language.

159
0:07:33.737,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But if you don't know why you do what you do,

160
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and people respond to why you do what you do,

161
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
then how will you ever get people

162
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to vote for you, or buy something from you,

163
0:07:44.332,000 --> 0:07:45,000
or, more importantly, be loyal

164
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and want to be a part of what it is that you do.

165
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have;

166
0:07:52.334,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe.

167
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
The goal is not just to hire people who need a job;

168
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
it's to hire people who believe what you believe.

169
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I always say that, you know,

170
0:08:04.404,000 --> 0:08:09,000
if you hire people just because they can do a job, they'll work for your money,

171
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
but if they believe what you believe,

172
0:08:12.075,000 --> 0:08:14,000
they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears.

173
0:08:14.534,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Nowhere else is there a better example than with the Wright brothers.

174
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Most people don't know about Samuel Pierpont Langley.

175
0:08:21.898,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And back in the early 20th century,

176
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day.

177
0:08:27.427,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Everybody was trying it.

178
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And Samuel Pierpont Langley had, what we assume,

179
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
to be the recipe for success.

180
0:08:34.957,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Even now, you ask people,

181
0:08:36.68,000 --> 0:08:38,000
"Why did your product or why did your company fail?"

182
0:08:39.323,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and people always give you the same permutation

183
0:08:41.608,000 --> 0:08:42,000
of the same three things:

184
0:08:43.053,000 --> 0:08:45,000
under-capitalized, the wrong people, bad market conditions.

185
0:08:46.054,000 --> 0:08:48,000
It's always the same three things, so let's explore that.

186
0:08:49.682,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Samuel Pierpont Langley

187
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
was given 50,000 dollars by the War Department

188
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
to figure out this flying machine.

189
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Money was no problem.

190
0:08:57.855,000 --> 0:08:59,000
He held a seat at Harvard

191
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected;

192
0:09:03.284,000 --> 0:09:04,000
he knew all the big minds of the day.

193
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
He hired the best minds money could find

194
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and the market conditions were fantastic.

195
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
The New York Times followed him around everywhere,

196
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and everyone was rooting for Langley.

197
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Then how come we've never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley?

198
0:09:19.745,000 --> 0:09:21,000
A few hundred miles away in Dayton, Ohio,

199
0:09:22.839,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Orville and Wilbur Wright,

200
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success.

201
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
They had no money;

202
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop.

203
0:09:33.523,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Not a single person on the Wright brothers' team

204
0:09:35.833,000 --> 0:09:36,000
had a college education,

205
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
not even Orville or Wilbur.

206
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And The New York Times followed them around nowhere.

207
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
The difference was,

208
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause, by a purpose, by a belief.

209
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine,

210
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
it'll change the course of the world.

211
0:09:55.644,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Samuel Pierpont Langley was different.

212
0:09:57.617,000 --> 0:09:59,000
He wanted to be rich, and he wanted to be famous.

213
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
He was in pursuit of the result.

214
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
He was in pursuit of the riches.

215
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And lo and behold, look what happened.

216
0:10:06.238,000 --> 0:10:09,000
The people who believed in the Wright brothers' dream

217
0:10:09.808,000 --> 0:10:11,000
worked with them with blood and sweat and tears.

218
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
The others just worked for the paycheck.

219
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
They tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out,

220
0:10:17.479,000 --> 0:10:19,000
they would have to take five sets of parts,

221
0:10:19.51,000 --> 0:10:22,000
because that's how many times they would crash before supper.

222
0:10:23.926,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And, eventually, on December 17th, 1903,

223
0:10:27.967,000 --> 0:10:29,000
the Wright brothers took flight,

224
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and no one was there to even experience it.

225
0:10:32.332,000 --> 0:10:34,000
We found out about it a few days later.

226
0:10:36.014,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing:

227
0:10:40.061,000 --> 0:10:42,000
the day the Wright brothers took flight,

228
0:10:42.419,000 --> 0:10:43,000
he quit.

229
0:10:43.444,000 --> 0:10:44,000
He could have said,

230
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
"That's an amazing discovery, guys,

231
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and I will improve upon your technology," but he didn't.

232
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
He wasn't first, he didn't get rich, he didn't get famous, so he quit.

233
0:10:54.97,000 --> 0:10:56,000
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.

234
0:10:57.494,000 --> 0:10:58,000
If you talk about what you believe,

235
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
you will attract those who believe what you believe.

236
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe?

237
0:11:07.664,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Something called the law of diffusion of innovation,

238
0:11:10.241,000 --> 0:11:12,000
if you don't know the law, you know the terminology.

239
0:11:12.775,000 --> 0:11:16,000
The first 2.5% of our population are our innovators.

240
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
The next 13.5% of our population are our early adopters.

241
0:11:22.512,000 --> 0:11:23,000
The next 34% are your early majority,

242
0:11:24.38,000 --> 0:11:26,000
your late majority and your laggards.

243
0:11:27.705,000 --> 0:11:29,000
The only reason these people buy touch-tone phones

244
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
is because you can't buy rotary phones anymore.

245
0:11:32.523,000 --> 0:11:33,000
(Laughter)

246
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
We all sit at various places at various times on this scale,

247
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us

248
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
is that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea,

249
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point

250
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
between 15 and 18 percent market penetration,

251
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and then the system tips.

252
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
I love asking businesses, "What's your conversion on new business?"

253
0:11:58.529,000 --> 0:12:,000
They love to tell you, "It's about 10 percent," proudly.

254
0:12:01.186,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Well, you can trip over 10% of the customers.

255
0:12:03.353,000 --> 0:12:04,000
We all have about 10% who just "get it."

256
0:12:05.323,000 --> 0:12:06,000
That's how we describe them, right?

257
0:12:07.06,000 --> 0:12:09,000
That's like that gut feeling, "Oh, they just get it."

258
0:12:09.561,000 --> 0:12:11,000
The problem is: How do you find the ones that get it

259
0:12:12.021,000 --> 0:12:14,000
before doing business versus the ones who don't get it?

260
0:12:14.689,000 --> 0:12:17,000
So it's this here, this little gap that you have to close,

261
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
as Jeffrey Moore calls it, "Crossing the Chasm" --

262
0:12:20.665,000 --> 0:12:23,000
because, you see, the early majority will not try something

263
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
until someone else has tried it first.

264
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And these guys, the innovators and the early adopters,

265
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
they're comfortable making those gut decisions.

266
0:12:33.475,000 --> 0:12:35,000
They're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions

267
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
that are driven by what they believe about the world

268
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and not just what product is available.

269
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
These are the people who stood in line for six hours

270
0:12:44.931,000 --> 0:12:46,000
to buy an iPhone when they first came out,

271
0:12:47.091,000 --> 0:12:5,000
when you could have bought one off the shelf the next week.

272
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
These are the people who spent 40,000 dollars

273
0:12:52.427,000 --> 0:12:54,000
on flat-screen TVs when they first came out,

274
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
even though the technology was substandard.

275
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And, by the way, they didn't do it because the technology was so great;

276
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
they did it for themselves.

277
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
It's because they wanted to be first.

278
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it

279
0:13:08.761,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and what you do simply proves what you believe.

280
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
In fact, people will do the things that prove what they believe.

281
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
The reason that person bought the iPhone in the first six hours,

282
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
stood in line for six hours,

283
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
was because of what they believed about the world,

284
0:13:25.665,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and how they wanted everybody to see them:

285
0:13:27.689,000 --> 0:13:28,000
they were first.

286
0:13:28.745,000 --> 0:13:3,000
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.

287
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So let me give you a famous example,

288
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation.

289
0:13:37.847,000 --> 0:13:38,000
First, the famous failure.

290
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
It's a commercial example.

291
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
As we said before, the recipe for success

292
0:13:43.521,000 --> 0:13:46,000
is money and the right people and the right market conditions.

293
0:13:46.937,000 --> 0:13:47,000
You should have success then.

294
0:13:48.706,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Look at TiVo.

295
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
From the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago

296
0:13:52.999,000 --> 0:13:53,000
to this current day,

297
0:13:54.261,000 --> 0:13:57,000
they are the single highest-quality product on the market,

298
0:13:57.935,000 --> 0:13:58,000
hands down, there is no dispute.

299
0:14:00.855,000 --> 0:14:01,000
They were extremely well-funded.

300
0:14:02.686,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Market conditions were fantastic.

301
0:14:04.409,000 --> 0:14:05,000
I mean, we use TiVo as verb.

302
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
I TiVo stuff on my piece-of-junk Time Warner DVR all the time.

303
0:14:09.543,000 --> 0:14:11,000
(Laughter)

304
0:14:12.059,000 --> 0:14:14,000
But TiVo's a commercial failure.

305
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
They've never made money.

306
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And when they went IPO,

307
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars

308
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and then plummeted, and it's never traded above 10.

309
0:14:22.713,000 --> 0:14:24,000
In fact, I don't think it's even traded above six,

310
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
except for a couple of little spikes.

311
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Because you see, when TiVo launched their product,

312
0:14:29.618,000 --> 0:14:31,000
they told us all what they had.

313
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
They said, "We have a product that pauses live TV,

314
0:14:35.738,000 --> 0:14:39,000
skips commercials, rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits

315
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
without you even asking."

316
0:14:43.435,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And the cynical majority said,

317
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
"We don't believe you.

318
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
We don't need it. We don't like it.

319
0:14:49.832,000 --> 0:14:5,000
You're scaring us."

320
0:14:51.951,000 --> 0:14:52,000
What if they had said,

321
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
"If you're the kind of person who likes to have total control

322
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
over every aspect of your life,

323
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
boy, do we have a product for you.

324
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
It pauses live TV, skips commercials,

325
0:15:06.262,000 --> 0:15:08,000
memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc."

326
0:15:09.118,000 --> 0:15:11,000
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it,

327
0:15:11.656,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe.

328
0:15:15.819,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation.

329
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
In the summer of 1963,

330
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
250,000 people showed up on the mall in Washington

331
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
to hear Dr. King speak.

332
0:15:31.414,000 --> 0:15:33,000
They sent out no invitations,

333
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and there was no website to check the date.

334
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
How do you do that?

335
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Well, Dr. King wasn't the only man in America

336
0:15:41.427,000 --> 0:15:43,000
who was a great orator.

337
0:15:43.854,000 --> 0:15:45,000
He wasn't the only man in America who suffered

338
0:15:46.044,000 --> 0:15:47,000
in a pre-civil rights America.

339
0:15:47.846,000 --> 0:15:49,000
In fact, some of his ideas were bad.

340
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
But he had a gift.

341
0:15:52.22,000 --> 0:15:55,000
He didn't go around telling people what needed to change in America.

342
0:15:55.515,000 --> 0:15:57,000
He went around and told people what he believed.

343
0:15:57.856,000 --> 0:16:,000
"I believe, I believe, I believe," he told people.

344
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And people who believed what he believed

345
0:16:03.815,000 --> 0:16:06,000
took his cause, and they made it their own, and they told people.

346
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And some of those people created structures

347
0:16:09.332,000 --> 0:16:11,000
to get the word out to even more people.

348
0:16:11.851,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And lo and behold, 250,000 people showed up

349
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
on the right day at the right time to hear him speak.

350
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
How many of them showed up for him?

351
0:16:24.579,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Zero.

352
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
They showed up for themselves.

353
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
It's what they believed about America

354
0:16:30.986,000 --> 0:16:32,000
that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours

355
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August.

356
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
It's what they believed, and it wasn't about black versus white:

357
0:16:39.332,000 --> 0:16:41,000
25% of the audience was white.

358
0:16:42.657,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Dr. King believed that there are two types of laws in this world:

359
0:16:46.284,000 --> 0:16:49,000
those that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by men.

360
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
And not until all the laws that are made by men

361
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
are consistent with the laws made by the higher authority

362
0:16:56.077,000 --> 0:16:57,000
will we live in a just world.

363
0:16:58.037,000 --> 0:17:,000
It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement

364
0:17:00.476,000 --> 0:17:03,000
was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life.

365
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
We followed, not for him, but for ourselves.

366
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
By the way, he gave the "I have a dream" speech,

367
0:17:09.585,000 --> 0:17:1,000
not the "I have a plan" speech.

368
0:17:11.594,000 --> 0:17:14,000
(Laughter)

369
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
Listen to politicians now, with their comprehensive 12-point plans.

370
0:17:18.475,000 --> 0:17:19,000
They're not inspiring anybody.

371
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Because there are leaders and there are those who lead.

372
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Leaders hold a position of power or authority,

373
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
but those who lead inspire us.

374
0:17:31.793,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Whether they're individuals or organizations,

375
0:17:34.168,000 --> 0:17:37,000
we follow those who lead, not because we have to,

376
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
but because we want to.

377
0:17:40.045,000 --> 0:17:44,000
We follow those who lead, not for them, but for ourselves.

378
0:17:45.744,000 --> 0:17:47,000
And it's those who start with "why"

379
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
that have the ability to inspire those around them

380
0:17:53.024,000 --> 0:17:55,000
or find others who inspire them.

381
0:17:56.476,000 --> 0:17:57,000
Thank you very much.

382
0:17:57.664,000 --> 0:17:58,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.8,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Let's go back to 1957.

2
0:00:18.68,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Representatives from six European countries

3
0:00:22.72,000 --> 0:00:23,000
had come to Rome

4
0:00:24.48,000 --> 0:00:27,000
to sign the treaty that was to create the European Union.

5
0:00:29.84,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Europe was destroyed.

6
0:00:32.56,000 --> 0:00:35,000
A world war had emerged from Europe.

7
0:00:37.28,000 --> 0:00:39,000
The human suffering was unbelievable

8
0:00:39.96,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and unprecedented.

9
0:00:43.72,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Those men

10
0:00:45.72,000 --> 0:00:49,000
wanted to create a peaceful,

11
0:00:49.88,000 --> 0:00:51,000
democratic Europe,

12
0:00:52.12,000 --> 0:00:54,000
a Europe that works for its people.

13
0:00:55.76,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And one of the many building blocks

14
0:00:58.6,000 --> 0:01:,000
in that peace project

15
0:01:00.88,000 --> 0:01:02,000
was a common European market.

16
0:01:05.08,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Already back then,

17
0:01:07.24,000 --> 0:01:08,000
they saw how markets,

18
0:01:09.08,000 --> 0:01:11,000
when left to themselves,

19
0:01:11.44,000 --> 0:01:16,000
can sort of slip into being just the private property

20
0:01:16.519,000 --> 0:01:18,000
of big businesses and cartels,

21
0:01:20.36,000 --> 0:01:22,000
meeting the needs of some businesses

22
0:01:23.52,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and not the needs of customers.

23
0:01:27.84,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So from our very first day,

24
0:01:30.68,000 --> 0:01:31,000
in 1957,

25
0:01:33.36,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the European Union had rules

26
0:01:36.24,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to defend fair competition.

27
0:01:39.68,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And that means competition on the merits,

28
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that you compete on the quality of your products,

29
0:01:46.24,000 --> 0:01:47,000
the prices you can offer,

30
0:01:48.2,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the services, the innovation that you produce.

31
0:01:52.4,000 --> 0:01:54,000
That's competition on the merits.

32
0:01:55.24,000 --> 0:01:58,000
You have a fair chance of making it on such a market.

33
0:01:59.32,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And it's my job,

34
0:02:01.36,000 --> 0:02:03,000
as Commissioner for Competition,

35
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to make sure that companies who do business in Europe

36
0:02:07.88,000 --> 0:02:09,000
live by those rules.

37
0:02:12.36,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But let's take a step back.

38
0:02:16.32,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Why do we need rules on competition at all?

39
0:02:20.88,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Why not just let businesses compete?

40
0:02:24.6,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Isn't that also the best for us

41
0:02:27.32,000 --> 0:02:29,000
if they compete freely,

42
0:02:29.64,000 --> 0:02:31,000
since more competition

43
0:02:31.92,000 --> 0:02:33,000
drives more quality,

44
0:02:34.12,000 --> 0:02:36,000
lower prices, more innovation?

45
0:02:39.08,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Well, mostly it is.

46
0:02:43.52,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But the problem is that sometimes, for businesses,

47
0:02:48.32,000 --> 0:02:51,000
competition can be inconvenient,

48
0:02:55.12,000 --> 0:02:58,000
because competition means that the race is never over,

49
0:02:59.76,000 --> 0:03:,000
the game is never won.

50
0:03:02.4,000 --> 0:03:04,000
No matter how well you were doing in the past,

51
0:03:05.08,000 --> 0:03:06,000
there's always someone

52
0:03:06.92,000 --> 0:03:09,000
who are out there wanting to take your place.

53
0:03:12.36,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So the temptation to avoid competition

54
0:03:15.56,000 --> 0:03:16,000
is powerful.

55
0:03:18.32,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It's rooted in motives as old as Adam and Eve:

56
0:03:23.8,000 --> 0:03:25,000
in greed for yet more money,

57
0:03:27.64,000 --> 0:03:3,000
in fear of losing your position in the market

58
0:03:31.12,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and all the benefits it brings.

59
0:03:35.96,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And when greed and fear

60
0:03:38.92,000 --> 0:03:39,000
are linked to power,

61
0:03:40.8,000 --> 0:03:41,000
you have a dangerous mix.

62
0:03:44.28,000 --> 0:03:45,000
We see that in political life.

63
0:03:47.36,000 --> 0:03:48,000
In part of the world,

64
0:03:49.24,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the mix of greed and fear

65
0:03:51.64,000 --> 0:03:53,000
means that those who get power

66
0:03:54.28,000 --> 0:03:58,000
become reluctant to give it back.

67
0:04:00.92,000 --> 0:04:01,000
One of the many things

68
0:04:02.48,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I like and admire in our democracies

69
0:04:07.24,000 --> 0:04:08,000
are the norms

70
0:04:09.08,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that make our leaders hand over power

71
0:04:12.28,000 --> 0:04:13,000
when voters tell them to.

72
0:04:16.72,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And competition rules can do a similar thing in the market,

73
0:04:20.92,000 --> 0:04:24,000
making sure that greed and fear doesn't overcome fairness.

74
0:04:27.6,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Because those rules mean

75
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that companies cannot misuse their power to undermine competition.

76
0:04:36.04,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Think for a moment about your car.

77
0:04:40.72,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It has thousands of parts,

78
0:04:44.28,000 --> 0:04:47,000
from the foam that makes the seats

79
0:04:47.68,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to the electrical wiring to the light bulbs.

80
0:04:51.68,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And for many of those parts,

81
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:55,000
the world's carmakers,

82
0:04:55.6,000 --> 0:04:58,000
they are dependent on only a few suppliers.

83
0:05:01.12,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So it's hardly surprising

84
0:05:03.68,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that it is kind of tempting for those suppliers

85
0:05:07.76,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to come together and fix prices.

86
0:05:11.92,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But just imagine what that could do

87
0:05:13.84,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to the final price of your new car in the market.

88
0:05:20.52,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Except, it's not imaginary.

89
0:05:24.4,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The European Commission

90
0:05:26.6,000 --> 0:05:31,000
has dealt with already seven different car parts cartels,

91
0:05:32.48,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and we're still investigating some.

92
0:05:36.32,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Here, the Department of Justice

93
0:05:39.52,000 --> 0:05:41,000
are also looking into the market for car parts,

94
0:05:42.92,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and it has called it the biggest criminal investigation

95
0:05:46.48,000 --> 0:05:47,000
it has ever pursued.

96
0:05:49.32,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But without competition rules,

97
0:05:51.76,000 --> 0:05:53,000
there would be no investigation,

98
0:05:54.24,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and there would be nothing to stop this collusion from happening

99
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
and the prices of your car to go up.

100
0:06:03.6,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Yet it's not only companies

101
0:06:05.96,000 --> 0:06:06,000
who can undermine fair competition.

102
0:06:08.96,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Governments can do it, too.

103
0:06:11.72,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And governments do that when they hand out subsidies

104
0:06:15.92,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to just the favorite few, the selected.

105
0:06:21.24,000 --> 0:06:24,000
They may do that when they hand out subsidies --

106
0:06:24.32,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and, of course, all financed by taxpayers --

107
0:06:28.68,000 --> 0:06:29,000
to companies.

108
0:06:30.76,000 --> 0:06:34,000
That may be in the form of special tax treatments,

109
0:06:35.72,000 --> 0:06:36,000
like the tax benefits

110
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that firms like Fiat, Starbucks and Apple got

111
0:06:42.08,000 --> 0:06:43,000
from some governments in Europe.

112
0:06:46.12,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Those subsidies stop companies from competing on equal terms.

113
0:06:51.24,000 --> 0:06:54,000
They can mean that the companies that succeed,

114
0:06:54.84,000 --> 0:06:56,000
well, they are the companies that got the most subsidy,

115
0:06:58.4,000 --> 0:07:,000
the ones that are the best-connected,

116
0:07:00.72,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and not, as it should be,

117
0:07:02.88,000 --> 0:07:04,000
the companies that serve consumers the best.

118
0:07:07.56,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So there are times when we need to step in

119
0:07:10.72,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to make sure that competition works the way it should.

120
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
By doing that, we help the market to work fairly,

121
0:07:19.72,000 --> 0:07:23,000
because competition gives consumers the power to demand a fair deal.

122
0:07:25.84,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It means that companies know that if they cannot offer good prices

123
0:07:30.36,000 --> 0:07:32,000
or the service that's expected,

124
0:07:32.96,000 --> 0:07:35,000
well, the customers will go somewhere else.

125
0:07:38.68,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And that sort of fairness is more important

126
0:07:41.36,000 --> 0:07:43,000
than we may sometimes realize.

127
0:07:47.56,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Very few people think about politics all the time.

128
0:07:51.6,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Some even skip it at election time.

129
0:07:55.88,000 --> 0:07:57,000
But we are all in the market.

130
0:07:58.4,000 --> 0:08:,000
Every day, we are in the market.

131
0:08:02.28,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And we don't want businesses to agree on prices in the back office.

132
0:08:07.52,000 --> 0:08:09,000
We don't want them to divide the market between them.

133
0:08:11.64,000 --> 0:08:12,000
We don't want one big company

134
0:08:13.56,000 --> 0:08:15,000
just to shut out competitors

135
0:08:16.24,000 --> 0:08:18,000
from ever showing us what they can do.

136
0:08:20.44,000 --> 0:08:21,000
If that happens,

137
0:08:22.76,000 --> 0:08:25,000
well, obviously, we feel that someone has cheated us,

138
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that we are being ignored or taken for granted by the market.

139
0:08:31.68,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And that may undermine not only our trust in the market

140
0:08:35.28,000 --> 0:08:37,000
but also our trust in the society.

141
0:08:39.68,000 --> 0:08:4,000
In a recent survey,

142
0:08:41.64,000 --> 0:08:43,000
more than two-thirds of Europeans

143
0:08:44.08,000 --> 0:08:48,000
said that they had felt the effects of lack of competition:

144
0:08:49.88,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that the price for electricity was too high,

145
0:08:53.28,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that the price for the medicines they needed was too high,

146
0:08:57.56,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that they had no real choice

147
0:08:59.08,000 --> 0:09:02,000
if they wanted to travel by bus or by plane,

148
0:09:02.44,000 --> 0:09:04,000
or they got poor service from their internet provider.

149
0:09:06.24,000 --> 0:09:09,000
In short, they found that the market didn't treat them fairly.

150
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And that might seem like very small things,

151
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
but they can give you this sense

152
0:09:19.72,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that the world isn't really fair.

153
0:09:23.72,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And they see the market, which was supposed to serve everyone,

154
0:09:28.6,000 --> 0:09:33,000
become more like the private property of a few powerful companies.

155
0:09:35.68,000 --> 0:09:36,000
The market is not the society.

156
0:09:38.08,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Our societies are, of course, much, much more than the market.

157
0:09:43.72,000 --> 0:09:45,000
But lack of trust in the market

158
0:09:46.4,000 --> 0:09:48,000
can rub off on society

159
0:09:49.28,000 --> 0:09:51,000
so we lose trust in our society as well.

160
0:09:55.48,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And it may be the most important thing we have, trust.

161
0:10:01.88,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We can trust each other if we are treated as equals.

162
0:10:08.08,000 --> 0:10:12,000
If we are all to have the same chances,

163
0:10:12.52,000 --> 0:10:15,000
well, we all have to follow the same fundamental rules.

164
0:10:17.56,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Of course, some people and some businesses are more successful than others,

165
0:10:23.36,000 --> 0:10:25,000
but we do not trust in a society

166
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
if the prizes are handed out

167
0:10:28.08,000 --> 0:10:3,000
even before the contest begins.

168
0:10:33.28,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And this is where competition rules come in,

169
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
because when we make sure that markets work fairly,

170
0:10:40.68,000 --> 0:10:43,000
then businesses compete on the merits,

171
0:10:43.92,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and that helps to build the trust that we need as citizens

172
0:10:49.2,000 --> 0:10:52,000
to feel comfortable and in control,

173
0:10:52.88,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and the trust that allows our society to work.

174
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Because without trust, everything becomes harder.

175
0:11:02.64,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Just to live our daily lives, we need to trust in strangers,

176
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:09,000
to trust the banks who keep our money,

177
0:11:10.8,000 --> 0:11:11,000
the builders who build our home,

178
0:11:14.2,000 --> 0:11:17,000
the electrician who comes to fix the wiring,

179
0:11:17.28,000 --> 0:11:19,000
the doctor who treats us when we're ill,

180
0:11:19.64,000 --> 0:11:21,000
not to mention the other drivers on the road,

181
0:11:22.48,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and everyone knows that they are crazy.

182
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And yet, we have to trust them

183
0:11:29.12,000 --> 0:11:3,000
to do the right thing.

184
0:11:32.12,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And the thing is that the more our societies grow,

185
0:11:36.88,000 --> 0:11:39,000
the more important trust becomes

186
0:11:39.92,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and the harder it is to build.

187
0:11:43.24,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And that is a paradox of modern societies.

188
0:11:48.96,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And this is especially true

189
0:11:51.32,000 --> 0:11:53,000
when technology changes the way that we interact.

190
0:11:55.84,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Of course, to some degree, technology can help us

191
0:11:58.2,000 --> 0:12:02,000
to build trust in one another with ratings systems and other systems

192
0:12:02.56,000 --> 0:12:04,000
that enable the sharing economy.

193
0:12:06.36,000 --> 0:12:09,000
But technology also creates completely new challenges

194
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
when they ask us not to trust in other people

195
0:12:14.12,000 --> 0:12:17,000
but to trust in algorithms and computers.

196
0:12:19.92,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Of course, we all see and share and appreciate

197
0:12:23.8,000 --> 0:12:26,000
all the good that new technology can do us.

198
0:12:27.8,000 --> 0:12:28,000
It's a lot of good.

199
0:12:30.24,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Autonomous cars can give people with disabilities new independence.

200
0:12:35.4,000 --> 0:12:36,000
It can save us all time,

201
0:12:36.84,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and it can make a much, much better use of resources.

202
0:12:41.24,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Algorithms that rely on crunching enormous amounts of data

203
0:12:46.2,000 --> 0:12:5,000
can enable our doctors to give us a much better treatment,

204
0:12:50.28,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and many other things.

205
0:12:54.44,000 --> 0:12:58,000
But no one is going to hand over their medical data

206
0:12:59.72,000 --> 0:13:02,000
or step into a car that's driven by an algorithm

207
0:13:03.88,000 --> 0:13:06,000
unless they trust the companies that they are dealing with.

208
0:13:09.56,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And that trust isn't always there.

209
0:13:13.24,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Today, for example, less than a quarter of Europeans

210
0:13:17.44,000 --> 0:13:21,000
trust online businesses to protect their personal information.

211
0:13:24.72,000 --> 0:13:25,000
But what if people knew

212
0:13:27.44,000 --> 0:13:3,000
that they could rely on technology companies

213
0:13:30.8,000 --> 0:13:31,000
to treat them fairly?

214
0:13:34.28,000 --> 0:13:36,000
What if they knew that those companies

215
0:13:36.72,000 --> 0:13:39,000
respond to competition by trying to do better,

216
0:13:41.4,000 --> 0:13:43,000
by trying to serve consumers better,

217
0:13:45.12,000 --> 0:13:47,000
not by using their power

218
0:13:47.48,000 --> 0:13:49,000
to shut out competitors,

219
0:13:49.88,000 --> 0:13:51,000
say, by pushing their services

220
0:13:52.28,000 --> 0:13:55,000
far, far down the list of search results

221
0:13:56.04,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and promoting themselves?

222
0:13:59.92,000 --> 0:14:03,000
What if they knew that compliance with the rules

223
0:14:04.2,000 --> 0:14:07,000
was built into the algorithms by design,

224
0:14:09.08,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that the algorithm had to go to competition rules school

225
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:13,000
before they were ever allowed to work,

226
0:14:16.12,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that those algorithms were designed

227
0:14:18.88,000 --> 0:14:21,000
in a way that meant that they couldn't collude,

228
0:14:22.52,000 --> 0:14:25,000
that they couldn't form their own little cartel

229
0:14:25.56,000 --> 0:14:26,000
in the black box they're working in?

230
0:14:29.48,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Together with regulation,

231
0:14:32.28,000 --> 0:14:33,000
competition rules can do that.

232
0:14:35.24,000 --> 0:14:36,000
They can help us to make sure

233
0:14:37.04,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that new technology treats people fairly

234
0:14:41.68,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and that everyone can compete on a level playing field.

235
0:14:46.8,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And that can help us build the trust

236
0:14:50.08,000 --> 0:14:52,000
that we need for real innovation

237
0:14:52.52,000 --> 0:14:53,000
to flourish

238
0:14:53.84,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and for societies to develop for citizens.

239
0:14:59.92,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Because trust cannot be imposed.

240
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:04,000
It has to be earned.

241
0:15:06.28,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Since the very first days of the European Union,

242
0:15:10.28,000 --> 0:15:11,000
60 years ago,

243
0:15:12.8,000 --> 0:15:14,000
our competition rules have helped

244
0:15:15.76,000 --> 0:15:16,000
to build that trust.

245
0:15:19.12,000 --> 0:15:2,000
A lot of things have changed.

246
0:15:22.44,000 --> 0:15:25,000
It's hard to say what those six representatives

247
0:15:25.8,000 --> 0:15:26,000
would have made of a smartphone.

248
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:3,000
But in today's world,

249
0:15:30.64,000 --> 0:15:32,000
as well as in their world,

250
0:15:33.28,000 --> 0:15:36,000
competition makes the market work for everyone.

251
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And that is why I am convinced

252
0:15:40.28,000 --> 0:15:43,000
that real and fair competition

253
0:15:43.48,000 --> 0:15:45,000
has a vital role to play

254
0:15:45.56,000 --> 0:15:47,000
in building the trust we need

255
0:15:47.76,000 --> 0:15:5,000
to get the best of our societies,

256
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and that starts with enforcing our rules,

257
0:15:57,000 --> 0:16:,000
actually just to make the market work for everyone.

258
0:16:00.84,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Thank you.

259
0:16:02.24,000 --> 0:16:05,000
(Applause)

260
0:16:07.76,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Bruno Giussani: Thank you.

261
0:16:11.36,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Thank you, Commissioner.

262
0:16:12.64,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Margrethe Vestager: It was a pleasure.

263
0:16:14.52,000 --> 0:16:15,000
BG: I want to ask you two questions.

264
0:16:16.28,000 --> 0:16:18,000
The first one is about data, because I have the impression

265
0:16:19.04,000 --> 0:16:22,000
that technology and data are changing the way competition takes place

266
0:16:22.48,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and the way competition regulation is designed and enforced.

267
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Can you maybe comment on that?

268
0:16:28.84,000 --> 0:16:31,000
MV: Well, yes, it is definitely challenging us,

269
0:16:32.2,000 --> 0:16:35,000
because we both have to sharpen our tools

270
0:16:35.44,000 --> 0:16:36,000
but also to develop new tools.

271
0:16:38.12,000 --> 0:16:4,000
When we were going through the Google responses

272
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:43,000
to our statement of objection,

273
0:16:43.76,000 --> 0:16:47,000
we were going through 5.2 terabytes of data.

274
0:16:49.08,000 --> 0:16:5,000
It's quite a lot.

275
0:16:51.32,000 --> 0:16:54,000
So we had to set up new systems.

276
0:16:54.64,000 --> 0:16:56,000
We had to figure out how to do this,

277
0:16:57.28,000 --> 0:17:01,000
because you cannot work the way you did just a few years ago.

278
0:17:01.4,000 --> 0:17:04,000
So we are definitely sharpening up our working methods.

279
0:17:05.88,000 --> 0:17:07,000
The other thing is that we try to distinguish

280
0:17:08.04,000 --> 0:17:09,000
between different kinds of data,

281
0:17:09.76,000 --> 0:17:11,000
because some data is extremely valuable

282
0:17:12.36,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and they will form, like, a barrier to entry in a market.

283
0:17:15.64,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Other things you can just -- it loses its value tomorrow.

284
0:17:20.56,000 --> 0:17:21,000
So we try to make sure

285
0:17:22.119,000 --> 0:17:25,000
that we never, ever underestimate the fact

286
0:17:25.599,000 --> 0:17:28,000
that data works as a currency in the market

287
0:17:29.599,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and as an asset that can be a real barrier for competition.

288
0:17:35.56,000 --> 0:17:39,000
BG: Google. You fined them 2.8 billion euros a few months ago.

289
0:17:40.119,000 --> 0:17:42,000
MV: No, that was dollars. It's not so strong these days.

290
0:17:42.8,000 --> 0:17:43,000
BG: Ah, well, depends on the --

291
0:17:44.32,000 --> 0:17:45,000
(Laughter)

292
0:17:45.36,000 --> 0:17:47,000
Google appealed the case. The case is going to court.

293
0:17:47.88,000 --> 0:17:48,000
It will last a while.

294
0:17:50.24,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Earlier, last year, you asked Apple to pay 13 billion in back taxes,

295
0:17:55,000 --> 0:17:58,000
and you have also investigated other companies,

296
0:17:58.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
including European and Russian companies,

297
0:18:00.24,000 --> 0:18:02,000
not only American companies, by far.

298
0:18:02.36,000 --> 0:18:06,000
Yet the investigations against the American companies

299
0:18:06.68,000 --> 0:18:08,000
are the ones that have attracted the most attention

300
0:18:09.12,000 --> 0:18:12,000
and they have also attracted some accusations.

301
0:18:12.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
You have been accused, essentially, of protectionism, of jealousy,

302
0:18:15.32,000 --> 0:18:17,000
or using legislation to hit back at American companies

303
0:18:18.24,000 --> 0:18:2,000
that have conquered European markets.

304
0:18:20.56,000 --> 0:18:23,000
"The Economist" just this week on the front page writes,

305
0:18:24.04,000 --> 0:18:25,000
"Vestager Versus The Valley."

306
0:18:25.96,000 --> 0:18:26,000
How do you react to that?

307
0:18:28.6,000 --> 0:18:31,000
MV: Well, first of all, I take it very seriously,

308
0:18:31.84,000 --> 0:18:36,000
because bias has no room in law enforcement.

309
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
We have to prove our cases with the evidence and the facts

310
0:18:41.36,000 --> 0:18:43,000
and the jurisprudence

311
0:18:43.4,000 --> 0:18:45,000
in order also to present it to the courts.

312
0:18:46.76,000 --> 0:18:49,000
The second thing is that Europe is open for business,

313
0:18:50.72,000 --> 0:18:51,000
but not for tax evasion.

314
0:18:52.48,000 --> 0:18:55,000
(Applause)

315
0:18:58.8,000 --> 0:19:01,000
The thing is that we are changing,

316
0:19:02.56,000 --> 0:19:04,000
and for instance, when I ask my daughters --

317
0:19:04.8,000 --> 0:19:05,000
they use Google as well --

318
0:19:06.36,000 --> 0:19:07,000
"Why do you do that?"

319
0:19:07.88,000 --> 0:19:09,000
They say, "Well, because it works. It's a very good product."

320
0:19:10.88,000 --> 0:19:12,000
They would never, ever, come up with the answer,

321
0:19:13.36,000 --> 0:19:14,000
"It's because it's a US product."

322
0:19:15.96,000 --> 0:19:16,000
It's just because it works.

323
0:19:17.84,000 --> 0:19:19,000
And that is of course how it should be.

324
0:19:19.92,000 --> 0:19:22,000
But just the same, it is important that someone is looking after to say,

325
0:19:23.36,000 --> 0:19:25,000
"Well, we congratulate you

326
0:19:25.72,000 --> 0:19:27,000
while you grow and grow and grow,

327
0:19:28.28,000 --> 0:19:29,000

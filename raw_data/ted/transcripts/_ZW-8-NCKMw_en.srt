1
0:00:12.499,000 --> 0:00:14,000
In the spring of 2016,

2
0:00:15.046,000 --> 0:00:19,000
a legal battle between Apple and the Federal Bureau of Investigation

3
0:00:19.474,000 --> 0:00:2,000
captured the world's attention.

4
0:00:21.633,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Apple has built security features into its mobile products

5
0:00:24.996,000 --> 0:00:27,000
which protect data on its devices from everyone but the owner.

6
0:00:28.853,000 --> 0:00:32,000
That means that criminals, hackers and yes, even governments

7
0:00:33.522,000 --> 0:00:34,000
are all locked out.

8
0:00:35.58,000 --> 0:00:37,000
For Apple's customers, this is a great thing.

9
0:00:38.581,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But governments are not so happy.

10
0:00:41.152,000 --> 0:00:43,000
You see, Apple has made a conscious decision

11
0:00:43.493,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to get out of the surveillance business.

12
0:00:46.077,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Apple has tried to make surveillance as difficult as possible

13
0:00:49.312,000 --> 0:00:51,000
for governments and any other actors.

14
0:00:53.676,000 --> 0:00:55,000
There are really two smartphone operating systems

15
0:00:56.03,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in the global smartphone market:

16
0:00:57.682,000 --> 0:00:58,000
iOS and Android.

17
0:00:59.749,000 --> 0:01:02,000
iOS is made by Apple. Android is made by Google.

18
0:01:03.446,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Apple has spent a lot of time and money

19
0:01:06.594,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to make sure that its products are as secure as possible.

20
0:01:10.458,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Apple encrypts all data stored on iPhones by default,

21
0:01:13.916,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and text messages sent from one Apple customer to another Apple customer

22
0:01:17.946,000 --> 0:01:18,000
are encrypted by default

23
0:01:19.672,000 --> 0:01:21,000
without the user having to take any actions.

24
0:01:22.769,000 --> 0:01:23,000
What this means is that,

25
0:01:24.404,000 --> 0:01:27,000
if the police seize an iPhone and it has a password,

26
0:01:28.724,000 --> 0:01:31,000
they'll have a difficult time getting any data off of it,

27
0:01:32.39,000 --> 0:01:33,000
if they can do it at all.

28
0:01:34.374,000 --> 0:01:38,000
In contrast, the security of Android just really isn't as good.

29
0:01:38.536,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Android phones, or at least most of the Android phones

30
0:01:41.606,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that have been sold to consumers,

31
0:01:43.236,000 --> 0:01:45,000
do not encrypt data stored on the device by default,

32
0:01:46.115,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and the built-in text messaging app in Android does not use encryption.

33
0:01:51.555,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So if the police seize an Android phone,

34
0:01:54.273,000 --> 0:01:57,000
chances are, they'll be able to get all the data they want

35
0:01:57.654,000 --> 0:01:58,000
off of that device.

36
0:01:59.858,000 --> 0:02:,000
Two smartphones

37
0:02:01.568,000 --> 0:02:03,000
from two of the biggest companies in the world;

38
0:02:04.497,000 --> 0:02:05,000
one that protects data by default,

39
0:02:06.948,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and one that doesn't.

40
0:02:08.84,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Apple is a seller of luxury goods.

41
0:02:12.006,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It dominates the high end of the market.

42
0:02:14.71,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And we would expect a manufacturer of luxury goods to have products

43
0:02:19.088,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that include more features.

44
0:02:21.567,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But not everyone can afford an iPhone.

45
0:02:23.998,000 --> 0:02:25,000
That's where Android really, really dominates:

46
0:02:26.609,000 --> 0:02:28,000
at the middle and low end of the market,

47
0:02:29.384,000 --> 0:02:31,000
smartphones for the billion and a half people

48
0:02:32.034,000 --> 0:02:34,000
who cannot or will not spend

49
0:02:34.928,000 --> 0:02:36,000
600 dollars on a phone.

50
0:02:41.275,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But the dominance of Android has led to what I call

51
0:02:47.129,000 --> 0:02:49,000
the "digital security divide."

52
0:02:49.365,000 --> 0:02:51,000
That is, there is now increasingly a gap

53
0:02:52.374,000 --> 0:02:56,000
between the privacy and security of the rich,

54
0:02:56.523,000 --> 0:02:58,000
who can afford devices that secure their data by default,

55
0:03:00.036,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and of the poor,

56
0:03:01.851,000 --> 0:03:05,000
whose devices do very little to protect them by default.

57
0:03:07.667,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So, think of the average Apple customer:

58
0:03:12.013,000 --> 0:03:16,000
a banker, a lawyer, a doctor, a politician.

59
0:03:17.387,000 --> 0:03:22,000
These individuals now increasingly have smartphones in their pockets

60
0:03:22.665,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that encrypt their calls, their text messages,

61
0:03:26.162,000 --> 0:03:27,000
all the data on the device,

62
0:03:27.721,000 --> 0:03:31,000
without them doing really anything to secure their information.

63
0:03:32.904,000 --> 0:03:36,000
In contrast, the poor and the most vulnerable in our societies

64
0:03:36.973,000 --> 0:03:41,000
are using devices that leave them completely vulnerable to surveillance.

65
0:03:43.065,000 --> 0:03:44,000
In the United States, where I live,

66
0:03:45.078,000 --> 0:03:48,000
African-Americans are more likely to be seen as suspicious

67
0:03:49.051,000 --> 0:03:5,000
or more likely to be profiled,

68
0:03:51.64,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and are more likely to be targeted by the state with surveillance.

69
0:03:56.008,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But African-Americans are also disproportionately likely

70
0:03:58.821,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to use Android devices that do nothing at all

71
0:04:01.941,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to protect them from that surveillance.

72
0:04:04.974,000 --> 0:04:05,000
This is a problem.

73
0:04:07.536,000 --> 0:04:09,000
We must remember that surveillance is a tool.

74
0:04:10.81,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It's a tool used by those in power

75
0:04:13.934,000 --> 0:04:15,000
against those who have no power.

76
0:04:17.173,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And while I think it's absolutely great

77
0:04:21.947,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that companies like Apple are making it easy for people to encrypt,

78
0:04:26.355,000 --> 0:04:29,000
if the only people who can protect themselves

79
0:04:30.194,000 --> 0:04:31,000
from the gaze of the government

80
0:04:31.709,000 --> 0:04:32,000
are the rich and powerful,

81
0:04:33.741,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that's a problem.

82
0:04:35.549,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And it's not just a privacy or a cybersecurity problem.

83
0:04:39.739,000 --> 0:04:4,000
It's a civil rights problem.

84
0:04:42.806,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So the lack of default security in Android

85
0:04:45.697,000 --> 0:04:5,000
is not just a problem for the poor and vulnerable users

86
0:04:51.1,000 --> 0:04:53,000
who are depending on these devices.

87
0:04:53.342,000 --> 0:04:55,000
This is actually a problem for our democracy.

88
0:04:56.237,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I'll explain what I mean.

89
0:04:58.514,000 --> 0:05:,000
Modern social movements rely on technology --

90
0:05:01.413,000 --> 0:05:06,000
from Black Lives Matter to the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street.

91
0:05:07.238,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The organizers of these movements and the members of these movements

92
0:05:11.237,000 --> 0:05:14,000
increasingly communicate and coordinate with smartphones.

93
0:05:16.446,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And so, naturally governments that feel threatened by these movements

94
0:05:20.321,000 --> 0:05:23,000
will also target the organizers and their smartphones.

95
0:05:25.462,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Now, it's quite possible

96
0:05:27.56,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that a future Martin Luther King or a Mandela or a Gandhi

97
0:05:31.648,000 --> 0:05:34,000
will have an iPhone and be protected from government surveillance.

98
0:05:36.283,000 --> 0:05:37,000
But chances are,

99
0:05:37.854,000 --> 0:05:4,000
they'll probably have a cheap, $20 Android phone in their pocket.

100
0:05:42.676,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And so if we do nothing to address the digital security divide,

101
0:05:46.521,000 --> 0:05:49,000
if we do nothing to ensure that everyone in our society

102
0:05:51.167,000 --> 0:05:53,000
gets the same benefits of encryption

103
0:05:53.476,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and is equally able to protect themselves from surveillance by the state,

104
0:05:57.157,000 --> 0:06:01,000
not only will the poor and vulnerable be exposed to surveillance,

105
0:06:02.404,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but future civil rights movements may be crushed

106
0:06:05.369,000 --> 0:06:07,000
before they ever reach their full potential.

107
0:06:07.813,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Thank you.

108
0:06:09.004,000 --> 0:06:12,000
(Applause)

109
0:06:15.94,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Helen Walters: Chris, thank you so much.

110
0:06:17.89,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I have a question for you.

111
0:06:19.786,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We saw recently in the press

112
0:06:21.663,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook covers over his camera

113
0:06:27.191,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and does something with his headphone mic jack.

114
0:06:30.189,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So I wanted to ask you a personal question, which is:

115
0:06:32.758,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Do you do that?

116
0:06:33.934,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And, on behalf of everyone here, particularly myself,

117
0:06:36.537,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Should we be doing that?

118
0:06:37.886,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Should we be covering these things?

119
0:06:39.678,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Christopher Soghoian: Putting a sticker -- actually, I like Band-Aids,

120
0:06:43.863,000 --> 0:06:45,000
because you can remove them and put them back on

121
0:06:46.152,000 --> 0:06:48,000
whenever you want to make a call or a Skype call.

122
0:06:48.488,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Putting a sticker over your web cam

123
0:06:50.214,000 --> 0:06:52,000
is probably the best thing you can do for your privacy

124
0:06:52.914,000 --> 0:06:53,000
in terms of bang for buck.

125
0:06:54.444,000 --> 0:06:57,000
There really is malware, malicious software out there

126
0:06:58.365,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that can take over your web cam,

127
0:07:00.246,000 --> 0:07:01,000
even without the light turning on.

128
0:07:02.14,000 --> 0:07:05,000
This is used by criminals. This is used by stalkers.

129
0:07:05.333,000 --> 0:07:09,000
You can buy $19.99 "spy on your ex-girlfriend" software online.

130
0:07:10.295,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It's really terrifying.

131
0:07:11.47,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And then, of course, it's used by governments.

132
0:07:14.018,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And there's obviously a sexual violence component to this,

133
0:07:17.263,000 --> 0:07:2,000
which is that this kind of surveillance can be used most effectively

134
0:07:20.988,000 --> 0:07:26,000
against women and other people who can be shamed in our society.

135
0:07:28.417,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Even if you think you have nothing to hide,

136
0:07:30.549,000 --> 0:07:34,000
at the very least, if you have children, teenagers in your lives,

137
0:07:35.131,000 --> 0:07:38,000
make sure you put a sticker on their camera and protect them.

138
0:07:38.165,000 --> 0:07:39,000
HW: Wow. Thank you so much. CS: Thank you.

139
0:07:40.183,000 --> 0:07:41,000
HW: Thanks, Chris.

140
0:07:41.358,000 --> 0:07:43,000
(Applause)

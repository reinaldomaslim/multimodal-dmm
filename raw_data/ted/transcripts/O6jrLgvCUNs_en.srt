1
0:00:12.646,000 --> 0:00:15,000
My name is Harry Baker. Harry Baker is my name.

2
0:00:15.964,000 --> 0:00:19,000
If your name was Harry Baker, then our names would be the same.

3
0:00:20.867,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:22.307,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It's a short introductory part.

5
0:00:24.954,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Yeah, I'm Harry.

6
0:00:26.486,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I study maths. I write poetry.

7
0:00:29.063,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So I thought I'd start with a love poem about prime numbers.

8
0:00:33.266,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:36.055,000 --> 0:00:38,000
This is called "59."

10
0:00:38.281,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I was going to call it "Prime Time Loving."

11
0:00:41.171,000 --> 0:00:42,000
That reaction is why I didn't.

12
0:00:43.071,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:44.56,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So, "59."

14
0:00:48.736,000 --> 0:00:5,000
59 wakes up on the wrong side of the bed.

15
0:00:51.359,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Realizes all his hair is on one side of his head.

16
0:00:53.91,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Takes just under a minute to work out that it’s because of the way that he slept.

17
0:00:57.797,000 --> 0:00:58,000
He finds some clothes and gets dressed.

18
0:00:59.713,000 --> 0:01:01,000
He can’t help but look in the mirror and be subtly impressed

19
0:01:02.539,000 --> 0:01:04,000
How he looks rough around the edges and yet casually messed.

20
0:01:05.372,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And as he glances out the window, he sees the sight that he gets blessed with

21
0:01:08.993,000 --> 0:01:09,000
of 60 from across the street.

22
0:01:10.495,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Now 60 was beautiful.

23
0:01:12.288,000 --> 0:01:15,000
With perfectly trimmed cuticles, dressed in something suitable.

24
0:01:15.316,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Never rude or crude at all.

25
0:01:16.753,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Unimprovable, right on time as usual, more on cue than a snooker ball

26
0:01:20.036,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but liked to play it super cool.

27
0:01:22.183,000 --> 0:01:25,000
59 wanted to tell her that he knew her favorite flower.

28
0:01:25.49,000 --> 0:01:27,000
He thought of her every second, every minute, every hour.

29
0:01:28.162,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But he knew it wouldn’t work, he’d never get the girl.

30
0:01:30.801,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Because although she lived across the street

31
0:01:32.911,000 --> 0:01:33,000
they came from different worlds.

32
0:01:34.451,000 --> 0:01:36,000
While 59 admired 60’s perfectly round figure,

33
0:01:36.881,000 --> 0:01:4,000
60 thought 59 was odd. (Laughter)

34
0:01:43.957,000 --> 0:01:46,000
One of his favorite films was "101 Dalmatians."

35
0:01:47.752,000 --> 0:01:5,000
She preferred the sequel.

36
0:01:50.754,000 --> 0:01:53,000
He romanticized the idea they were star-crossed lovers.

37
0:01:53.87,000 --> 0:01:56,000
They could overcome the odds and evens because they had each other.

38
0:01:57.043,000 --> 0:02:,000
While she maintained the strict views imposed on her by her mother

39
0:02:00.243,000 --> 0:02:01,000
That separate could not be equal.

40
0:02:02.04,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And though at the time he felt stupid and dumb

41
0:02:04.208,000 --> 0:02:06,000
For trying to love a girl controlled by her stupid mum,

42
0:02:06.85,000 --> 0:02:08,000
He should have been comforted by the simple sum.

43
0:02:09.239,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Take 59 away from 60, and you’re left with the one.

44
0:02:11.669,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Sure enough after two months of moping around,

45
0:02:14.197,000 --> 0:02:16,000
61 days later, 61 was who he found,

46
0:02:16.649,000 --> 0:02:18,000
He had lost his keys and his parents were out.

47
0:02:18.871,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So one day after school he went into a house

48
0:02:20.993,000 --> 0:02:22,000
As he noticed the slightly wonky numbers on the door,

49
0:02:23.506,000 --> 0:02:25,000
He wondered why he’d never introduced himself before,

50
0:02:25.991,000 --> 0:02:27,000
As she let him in, his jaw dropped in awe.

51
0:02:28.119,000 --> 0:02:31,000
61 was like 60, but a little bit more. (Laughter)

52
0:02:31.308,000 --> 0:02:34,000
She had prettier eyes, and an approachable smile,

53
0:02:34.71,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And like him, rough around the edges, casual style,

54
0:02:37.136,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And like him, everything was in disorganized piles,

55
0:02:39.512,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And like him, her mum didn’t mind if friends stayed a while.

56
0:02:42.345,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Because she was like him, and he liked her.

57
0:02:44.44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
He reckoned she would like him if she knew he was like her,

58
0:02:47.198,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And it was different this time. I mean, this girl was wicked,

59
0:02:50.076,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So he plucked up the courage and asked for her digits.

60
0:02:52.636,000 --> 0:02:56,000
She said, "I'm 61." He grinned, said, "I'm 59."

61
0:02:57.35,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Today I’ve had a really nice time,

62
0:02:58.983,000 --> 0:03:,000
So tomorrow if you wanted you could come over to mine?

63
0:03:01.556,000 --> 0:03:01,000
She said, "Sure."

64
0:03:02.419,000 --> 0:03:04,000
She loved talking to someone just as quirky,

65
0:03:04.603,000 --> 0:03:05,000
She agreed to this unofficial first date.

66
0:03:06.551,000 --> 0:03:08,000
In the end he was only ready one minute early,

67
0:03:08.711,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But it didn’t matter because she arrived one minute late.

68
0:03:11.435,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And from that moment on there was nonstop chatter,

69
0:03:13.879,000 --> 0:03:15,000
How they loved "X Factor," how they had two factors,

70
0:03:16.354,000 --> 0:03:2,000
How that did not matter, distinctiveness made them better,

71
0:03:20.454,000 --> 0:03:22,000
By the end of the night they knew they were meant together.

72
0:03:23.239,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And one day she was talking about stuck-up 60,

73
0:03:26.213,000 --> 0:03:27,000
She noticed that 59 looked a bit shifty.

74
0:03:28.14,000 --> 0:03:29,000
He blushed, told her of his crush:

75
0:03:29.837,000 --> 0:03:31,000
“The best thing that never happened because it led to us.”

76
0:03:32.604,000 --> 0:03:34,000
61 was clever, see, not prone to jealousy,

77
0:03:35.446,000 --> 0:03:37,000
She looked him in the eyes and told him quite tenderly,

78
0:03:38.148,000 --> 0:03:42,000
"You’re 59, I’m 61, together we combine to become twice what 60 could ever be."

79
0:03:43.14,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:46.483,000 --> 0:03:48,000
At this point 59 had tears in his eyes,

81
0:03:48.77,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Was so glad to have this one-of-a-kind girl in his life.

82
0:03:51.388,000 --> 0:03:53,000
He told her the very definition of being prime

83
0:03:53.588,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Was that with only one and himself could his heart divide,

84
0:03:56.345,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And she was the one he wanted to give his heart to,

85
0:03:58.769,000 --> 0:04:01,000
She said she felt the same and now she knew the films were half true.

86
0:04:02.098,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Because that wasn't real love, that love was just a sample,

87
0:04:04.919,000 --> 0:04:07,000
When it came to real love, they were a prime example.

88
0:04:08.193,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Cheers.

89
0:04:09.888,000 --> 0:04:13,000
(Applause)

90
0:04:20.522,000 --> 0:04:21,000
That was the first poem that I wrote

91
0:04:22.334,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and it was for a prime number-themed poetry night -- (Laughter) --

92
0:04:26.753,000 --> 0:04:29,000
which turned out to be a prime number-themed poetry competition.

93
0:04:29.973,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And I became a prime number-themed poetry competition winner,

94
0:04:33.2,000 --> 0:04:36,000
or as I like to call it, a prime minister. (Laughter)

95
0:04:36.709,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And this is how I discovered these things called poetry slams,

96
0:04:39.657,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and if you don't know what a poetry slam is,

97
0:04:41.791,000 --> 0:04:43,000
it was a format come up with in America 30 years ago

98
0:04:44.485,000 --> 0:04:46,000
as a way of tricking people into going to poetry events

99
0:04:47.457,000 --> 0:04:49,000
by putting an exciting word like "slam" on the end.

100
0:04:50.312,000 --> 0:04:51,000
(Laughter)

101
0:04:51.706,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And each performer got three minutes to perform

102
0:04:54.608,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and then random audience members would hold up scorecards,

103
0:04:57.403,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and they would end up with a numerical score,

104
0:04:59.53,000 --> 0:05:,000
and what this meant is,

105
0:05:00.738,000 --> 0:05:03,000
it kind of broke down the barrier between performer and audience

106
0:05:03.943,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and encouraged the kind of connection with the listener.

107
0:05:06.653,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And what it also means is you can win.

108
0:05:08.681,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And if you win a poetry slam, you can call yourself a slam champion

109
0:05:13.021,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and pretend you're a wrestler,

110
0:05:15.412,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and if you lose a poetry slam you can say, "Oh, what? Poetry's a subjective art form,

111
0:05:19.476,000 --> 0:05:21,000
you can't put numbers on such things."

112
0:05:21.774,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Laughter)

113
0:05:23.467,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But I loved it, and I got involved in these slams,

114
0:05:25.814,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and I became the U.K. slam champion

115
0:05:28.113,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and got invited to the Poetry World Cup in Paris,

116
0:05:31.178,000 --> 0:05:32,000
which was unbelievable.

117
0:05:32.617,000 --> 0:05:35,000
It was people from all around the world speaking in their native languages

118
0:05:36.133,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to be judged by five French strangers.

119
0:05:38.585,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:40.744,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And somehow, I won, which was great,

121
0:05:44.715,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and I've been able to travel the world since doing it,

122
0:05:47.849,000 --> 0:05:49,000
but it also means that this next piece

123
0:05:49.892,000 --> 0:05:52,000
is technically the best poem in the world.

124
0:05:53.375,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

125
0:05:57.369,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So...

126
0:05:58.785,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Applause)

127
0:06:03.638,000 --> 0:06:05,000
According to five French strangers.

128
0:06:06.633,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So this is "Paper People."

129
0:06:10.557,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I like people.

130
0:06:12.636,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I'd like some paper people.

131
0:06:14.992,000 --> 0:06:17,000
They’d be purple paper people. Maybe pop-up purple paper people.

132
0:06:18.173,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Proper pop-up purple paper people.

133
0:06:20.913,000 --> 0:06:22,000
"How do you prop up pop-up purple paper people?"

134
0:06:23.839,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I hear you cry. Well I ...

135
0:06:26.253,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I’d probably prop up proper pop-up purple paper people

136
0:06:29.011,000 --> 0:06:32,000
with a proper pop-up purple people paperclip,

137
0:06:32.662,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but I’d pre-prepare appropriate adhesives as alternatives,

138
0:06:35.399,000 --> 0:06:37,000
a cheeky pack of Blu Tack just in case the paper slipped.

139
0:06:38.171,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Because I could build a pop-up metropolis.

140
0:06:40.254,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but I wouldn’t wanna deal with all the paper people politics.

141
0:06:43.135,000 --> 0:06:45,000
paper politicians with their paper-thin policies,

142
0:06:45.496,000 --> 0:06:47,000
broken promises without appropriate apologies.

143
0:06:47.72,000 --> 0:06:5,000
There’d be a little paper me. And a little paper you.

144
0:06:51.575,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And we could watch paper TV and it would all be pay-per-view.

145
0:06:54.799,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Laughter)

146
0:06:56.273,000 --> 0:06:59,000
We’d see the poppy paper rappers rap about their paper package

147
0:06:59.539,000 --> 0:07:03,000
or watch paper people carriers get stuck in paper traffic on the A4.

148
0:07:04.509,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Laughter) Paper.

149
0:07:07.248,000 --> 0:07:12,000
There’d be a paper princess Kate but we’d all stare at paper Pippa,

150
0:07:12.402,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and then we’d all live in fear of killer Jack the Paper-Ripper,

151
0:07:15.385,000 --> 0:07:18,000
because the paper propaganda propagates the people's prejudices,

152
0:07:18.439,000 --> 0:07:2,000
papers printing pictures of the photogenic terrorists.

153
0:07:21.095,000 --> 0:07:23,000
A little paper me. And a little paper you.

154
0:07:23.615,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And in a pop-up population people’s problems pop up too.

155
0:07:26.288,000 --> 0:07:29,000
There’d be a pompous paper parliament who remained out of touch,

156
0:07:29.295,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and who ignored the people's protests about all the paper cuts,

157
0:07:32.282,000 --> 0:07:35,000
then the peaceful paper protests would get blown to paper pieces,

158
0:07:35.524,000 --> 0:07:37,000
by the confetti cannons manned by pre-emptive police.

159
0:07:38.064,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And yes there’d still be paper money, so there’d still be paper greed,

160
0:07:41.639,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and the paper piggy bankers pocketing more than they need,

161
0:07:44.358,000 --> 0:07:46,000
purchasing the potpourri to pepper their paper properties,

162
0:07:47.106,000 --> 0:07:49,000
others live in poverty and ain’t acknowledged properly.

163
0:07:49.776,000 --> 0:07:51,000
A proper poor economy where so many are proper poor,

164
0:07:52.248,000 --> 0:07:54,000
but while their needs are ignored the money goes to big wars.

165
0:07:55.153,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Origami armies unfold plans for paper planes

166
0:07:57.245,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and we remain imprisoned in our own paper chains,

167
0:07:59.605,000 --> 0:08:02,000
but the greater shame is that it always seems to stay the same,

168
0:08:03.264,000 --> 0:08:05,000
what changes is who’s in power choosing how to lay the blame,

169
0:08:06.172,000 --> 0:08:09,000
they’re naming names, forgetting these are names of people,

170
0:08:09.611,000 --> 0:08:12,000
because in the end it all comes down to people.

171
0:08:12.697,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I like people.

172
0:08:14.144,000 --> 0:08:15,000
'Cause even when the situation’s dire,

173
0:08:15.965,000 --> 0:08:17,000
it is only ever people who are able to inspire,

174
0:08:18.224,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and on paper, it’s hard to see how we all cope.

175
0:08:21.459,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But in the bottom of Pandora’s box there’s still hope,

176
0:08:24.12,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and I still hope 'cause I believe in people.

177
0:08:26.953,000 --> 0:08:28,000
People like my grandparents.

178
0:08:29.275,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Who every single day since I was born,

179
0:08:31.09,000 --> 0:08:34,000
have taken time out of their morning to pray for me.

180
0:08:34.305,000 --> 0:08:37,000
That’s 7892 days straight of someone checking I’m okay,

181
0:08:37.719,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and that’s amazing.

182
0:08:39.713,000 --> 0:08:41,000
People like my aunt who puts on plays with prisoners.

183
0:08:42.417,000 --> 0:08:44,000
People who are capable of genuine forgiveness.

184
0:08:44.601,000 --> 0:08:45,000
People like the persecuted Palestinians.

185
0:08:46.52,000 --> 0:08:48,000
People who go out of their way to make your life better,

186
0:08:49.174,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and expect nothing in return.

187
0:08:50.868,000 --> 0:08:52,000
You see, people have potential to be powerful.

188
0:08:53.043,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Just because the people in power tend to pretend to be victims

189
0:08:56.198,000 --> 0:08:58,000
we don’t need to succumb to that system.

190
0:08:58.25,000 --> 0:09:,000
And a paper population is no different.

191
0:09:00.595,000 --> 0:09:03,000
There’s a little paper me. And a little paper you.

192
0:09:04.313,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And in a pop-up population people's problems pop up too,

193
0:09:06.941,000 --> 0:09:09,000
but even if the whole world fell apart then we’d still make it through.

194
0:09:10.324,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Because we’re people.

195
0:09:12.785,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Thank you.

196
0:09:15.247,000 --> 0:09:19,000
(Applause)

197
0:09:30.688,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Thank you very much. I've just got time for one more.

198
0:09:33.543,000 --> 0:09:36,000
For me, poetry has been the ultimate way of ideas without frontiers.

199
0:09:37.038,000 --> 0:09:38,000
When I first started,

200
0:09:38.04,000 --> 0:09:41,000
the people who inspired me were the ones with the amazing stories,

201
0:09:41.145,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and I thought, as an 18-year-old with a happy life, it was too normal,

202
0:09:45.281,000 --> 0:09:48,000
but I could create these worlds where I could talk about my experiences

203
0:09:49.007,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and dreams and beliefs.

204
0:09:50.331,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So it's amazing to be here in front of you today.

205
0:09:53.326,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Thank you for being here.

206
0:09:54.742,000 --> 0:09:55,000
If you weren't here,

207
0:09:56.019,000 --> 0:09:58,000
it would be pretty much like the sound check yesterday.

208
0:09:58.759,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Laughter)

209
0:10:00.826,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And this is more fun.

210
0:10:03.403,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So this last one is called "The Sunshine Kid."

211
0:10:05.563,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Thank you very much for listening.

212
0:10:08.697,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Old man sunshine was proud of his sun,

213
0:10:12.087,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And it brightened his day to see his little boy run,

214
0:10:14.553,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Not because of what he’d done, nor the problems overcome,

215
0:10:17.219,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But that despite that his disposition remained a sunny one.

216
0:10:20.134,000 --> 0:10:22,000
It hadn’t always been like this.

217
0:10:22.73,000 --> 0:10:24,000
There’d been times when he’d tried to hide his brightness,

218
0:10:25.461,000 --> 0:10:27,000
You see, every star hits periods of hardship,

219
0:10:27.597,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It takes a brighter light to inspire them through the darkness.

220
0:10:30.801,000 --> 0:10:32,000
If we go back to when he was born in a nebula,

221
0:10:33.155,000 --> 0:10:35,000
We know that he never was thought of as regular,

222
0:10:35.474,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Because he had a flair about him,

223
0:10:37.21,000 --> 0:10:38,000
To say the Midas touch is wrong

224
0:10:38.765,000 --> 0:10:4,000
But all he went near seemed to turn a little bronze,

225
0:10:41.203,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Yes this sun was loved by some more than others,

226
0:10:43.847,000 --> 0:10:45,000
It was a case of Joseph and his dreamcoat and his brothers

227
0:10:46.579,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Because standing out from the crowd had its pros and its cons,

228
0:10:49.516,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And jealousy created enemies in those he outshone

229
0:10:52.106,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Such as the Shadow People.

230
0:10:53.417,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Now the Shadow People didn’t like the Sunshine Kid,

231
0:10:55.818,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Because he showed up the dark things the Shadow People did,

232
0:10:58.585,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And when he shone he showed the places where the Shadow People hid,

233
0:11:01.735,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So the Shadow People had an evil plan to get rid of him,

234
0:11:04.353,000 --> 0:11:06,000
First up -- they made fun of his sunspots,

235
0:11:06.707,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Shooting his dreams from the sky, their words were gunshots,

236
0:11:09.525,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Designed to remind him he wasn’t very cool

237
0:11:12.103,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And he didn’t fit in with any popular kids at school.

238
0:11:14.587,000 --> 0:11:17,000
They said his head was up in space and they would bring him down to Earth,

239
0:11:18.152,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Essentially he came from nothing and that is what he was worth,

240
0:11:21.143,000 --> 0:11:23,000
He’d never get to go to university to learn,

241
0:11:23.277,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Only degrees he’d ever show would be the first degree burns

242
0:11:26.046,000 --> 0:11:27,000
From those that came too close,

243
0:11:27.754,000 --> 0:11:28,000
they told him he was too bright,

244
0:11:29.342,000 --> 0:11:31,000
That’s why no one ever looked him in the eyes,

245
0:11:31.519,000 --> 0:11:32,000
His judgment became clouded

246
0:11:32.991,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So did the sky, With evaporated tears

247
0:11:34.915,000 --> 0:11:35,000
as the sun started to cry.

248
0:11:36.158,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Because the sunshine kid was bright, with a warm personality,

249
0:11:41.405,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And inside he burned savagely

250
0:11:43.332,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Hurt by the words and curses of the shadowy folk

251
0:11:45.701,000 --> 0:11:47,000
who spoke holes in his soul and left cavities,

252
0:11:48.278,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And as his heart hardened, his spark darkened,

253
0:11:52.016,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Every time they called him names it cooled his flames,

254
0:11:54.6,000 --> 0:11:56,000
He thought they might like him if he kept his light dim

255
0:11:57.277,000 --> 0:12:,000
But they were busy telling lightning she had terrible aim,

256
0:12:00.468,000 --> 0:12:02,000
He couldn’t quite get to grips with what they said,

257
0:12:03.254,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So he let his light be eclipsed by what they said,

258
0:12:06.096,000 --> 0:12:08,000
He fell into a Lone Star State like Texas,

259
0:12:08.235,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And felt like he’d been punched in his solar plexus.

260
0:12:10.661,000 --> 0:12:14,000
But that’s when Little Miss Sunshine came along

261
0:12:14.718,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Singing her favorite song about how we’re made to be strong,

262
0:12:17.65,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And you don’t have to be wrong to belong, Just be true to who you are,

263
0:12:21.156,000 --> 0:12:23,000
because we are all stars at heart.

264
0:12:23.362,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Little Miss Sunshine was hot stuff,

265
0:12:27.193,000 --> 0:12:29,000
The kind of girl when you looked at her

266
0:12:29.458,000 --> 0:12:3,000
you forgot stuff,

267
0:12:31.174,000 --> 0:12:32,000
But for him, there was no forgetting her,

268
0:12:33.164,000 --> 0:12:35,000
The minute he saw her her image burned in his retina,

269
0:12:35.645,000 --> 0:12:37,000
She was out of this world, and she accepted him,

270
0:12:37.957,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Something about this girl meant he knew whenever she was next to him,

271
0:12:41.22,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Things weren’t as dark as they seemed, and he dared to dream,

272
0:12:44.121,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Shadows were nowhere to be seen; when she was there he beamed,

273
0:12:47.055,000 --> 0:12:49,000
His eyes would light up in ways that can’t be faked,

274
0:12:49.528,000 --> 0:12:52,000
When she grinned her rays erased the razor-tipped words of hate,

275
0:12:52.667,000 --> 0:12:55,000
They gave each other nicknames, they were "cool star" and "fun sun,"

276
0:12:55.865,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And gradually the shadowy damage became undone,

277
0:12:58.615,000 --> 0:13:01,000
She was one in a septillion, and she was brilliant,

278
0:13:02.552,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Could turn the coldest blooded reptilians vermillion,

279
0:13:05.371,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Loved by billions, from Chileans to Brazilians,

280
0:13:08.038,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And taught the Sunshine Kid the meaning of resilience.

281
0:13:10.73,000 --> 0:13:12,000
She said: “All the darkness in the world

282
0:13:13.562,000 --> 0:13:16,000
cannot put out the light from a single candle

283
0:13:16.836,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So how the hell can they handle your light?

284
0:13:18.946,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Only you can choose to dim it, and the sky is the limit,

285
0:13:21.875,000 --> 0:13:22,000
so silence the critics by burning.”

286
0:13:23.692,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And if eyes are windows to the soul then she drew back the curtains

287
0:13:26.861,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And let the sun shine through the hurting.

288
0:13:28.841,000 --> 0:13:3,000
In a universe of adversity these stars stuck together,

289
0:13:31.429,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And though days became nights the memories would last forever,

290
0:13:34.335,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Whether the weatherman said it or not, it would be fine,

291
0:13:37.031,000 --> 0:13:39,000
'Cause even behind the clouds the kid could still shine.

292
0:13:39.668,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Yes, the Sunshine Kid was bright, with a warm personality,

293
0:13:42.531,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And inside he burned savagely,

294
0:13:44.188,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Fueled by the fire inspired across galaxies

295
0:13:47.532,000 --> 0:13:49,000
By the girl who showed him belief.

296
0:13:50.318,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Thank you very much.

297
0:13:53.058,000 --> 0:13:59,000
(Applause)

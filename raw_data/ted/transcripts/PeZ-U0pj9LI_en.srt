2
0:00:12.53,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So let's start with some good news,

3
0:00:15.491,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and the good news has to do with what do we know

4
0:00:17.84,000 --> 0:00:19,000
based on biomedical research

5
0:00:20.107,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that actually has changed the outcomes

6
0:00:23.561,000 --> 0:00:26,000
for many very serious diseases?

7
0:00:26.66,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Let's start with leukemia,

8
0:00:28.907,000 --> 0:00:3,000
acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL,

9
0:00:31.435,000 --> 0:00:33,000
the most common cancer of children.

10
0:00:33.873,000 --> 0:00:34,000
When I was a student,

11
0:00:35.835,000 --> 0:00:38,000
the mortality rate was about 95 percent.

12
0:00:39.675,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Today, some 25, 30 years later, we're talking about

13
0:00:42.808,000 --> 0:00:45,000
a mortality rate that's reduced by 85 percent.

14
0:00:46.435,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Six thousand children each year

15
0:00:49.051,000 --> 0:00:53,000
who would have previously died of this disease are cured.

16
0:00:53.24,000 --> 0:00:54,000
If you want the really big numbers,

17
0:00:55.031,000 --> 0:00:57,000
look at these numbers for heart disease.

18
0:00:57.859,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Heart disease used to be the biggest killer,

19
0:00:59.651,000 --> 0:01:,000
particularly for men in their 40s.

20
0:01:01.155,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Today, we've seen a 63-percent reduction in mortality

21
0:01:04.649,000 --> 0:01:06,000
from heart disease --

22
0:01:06.71,000 --> 0:01:1,000
remarkably, 1.1 million deaths averted every year.

23
0:01:11.595,000 --> 0:01:13,000
AIDS, incredibly, has just been named,

24
0:01:14.316,000 --> 0:01:16,000
in the past month, a chronic disease,

25
0:01:16.597,000 --> 0:01:18,000
meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV

26
0:01:19.512,000 --> 0:01:23,000
is expected not to live weeks, months, or a couple of years,

27
0:01:23.583,000 --> 0:01:25,000
as we said only a decade ago,

28
0:01:25.853,000 --> 0:01:27,000
but is thought to live decades,

29
0:01:28.245,000 --> 0:01:32,000
probably to die in his '60s or '70s from other causes altogether.

30
0:01:32.741,000 --> 0:01:35,000
These are just remarkable, remarkable changes

31
0:01:35.766,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in the outlook for some of the biggest killers.

32
0:01:38.355,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And one in particular

33
0:01:40.434,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that you probably wouldn't know about, stroke,

34
0:01:42.479,000 --> 0:01:43,000
which has been, along with heart disease,

35
0:01:44.08,000 --> 0:01:46,000
one of the biggest killers in this country,

36
0:01:46.258,000 --> 0:01:47,000
is a disease in which now we know

37
0:01:48.049,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that if you can get people into the emergency room

38
0:01:50.978,000 --> 0:01:52,000
within three hours of the onset,

39
0:01:53.152,000 --> 0:01:55,000
some 30 percent of them will be able to leave the hospital

40
0:01:55.757,000 --> 0:01:58,000
without any disability whatsoever.

41
0:01:58.876,000 --> 0:02:,000
Remarkable stories,

42
0:02:01.133,000 --> 0:02:03,000
good-news stories,

43
0:02:03.164,000 --> 0:02:06,000
all of which boil down to understanding

44
0:02:06.229,000 --> 0:02:09,000
something about the diseases that has allowed us

45
0:02:09.581,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to detect early and intervene early.

46
0:02:12.904,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Early detection, early intervention,

47
0:02:15.039,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that's the story for these successes.

48
0:02:18.109,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Unfortunately, the news is not all good.

49
0:02:20.845,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Let's talk about one other story

50
0:02:23.194,000 --> 0:02:24,000
which has to do with suicide.

51
0:02:24.885,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Now this is, of course, not a disease, per se.

52
0:02:27.537,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It's a condition, or it's a situation

53
0:02:30.625,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that leads to mortality.

54
0:02:32.414,000 --> 0:02:35,000
What you may not realize is just how prevalent it is.

55
0:02:35.494,000 --> 0:02:39,000
There are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States.

56
0:02:39.703,000 --> 0:02:41,000
That means one about every 15 minutes.

57
0:02:42.461,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Third most common cause of death amongst people

58
0:02:45.237,000 --> 0:02:47,000
between the ages of 15 and 25.

59
0:02:48.013,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize

60
0:02:50.261,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that this is twice as common as homicide

61
0:02:52.773,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and actually more common as a source of death

62
0:02:55.422,000 --> 0:02:58,000
than traffic fatalities in this country.

63
0:02:58.757,000 --> 0:03:,000
Now, when we talk about suicide,

64
0:03:01.389,000 --> 0:03:04,000
there is also a medical contribution here,

65
0:03:04.501,000 --> 0:03:06,000
because 90 percent of suicides

66
0:03:06.933,000 --> 0:03:07,000
are related to a mental illness:

67
0:03:08.703,000 --> 0:03:11,000
depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,

68
0:03:11.749,000 --> 0:03:14,000
anorexia, borderline personality. There's a long list

69
0:03:14.808,000 --> 0:03:16,000
of disorders that contribute,

70
0:03:16.917,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and as I mentioned before, often early in life.

71
0:03:20.941,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But it's not just the mortality from these disorders.

72
0:03:24.145,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It's also morbidity.

73
0:03:25.787,000 --> 0:03:27,000
If you look at disability,

74
0:03:28.048,000 --> 0:03:3,000
as measured by the World Health Organization

75
0:03:30.2,000 --> 0:03:33,000
with something they call the Disability Adjusted Life Years,

76
0:03:33.725,000 --> 0:03:35,000
it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of

77
0:03:35.821,000 --> 0:03:36,000
except an economist,

78
0:03:37.135,000 --> 0:03:4,000
except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost

79
0:03:40.577,000 --> 0:03:43,000
in terms of disability from medical causes,

80
0:03:43.76,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and as you can see, virtually 30 percent

81
0:03:46.653,000 --> 0:03:48,000
of all disability from all medical causes

82
0:03:48.917,000 --> 0:03:5,000
can be attributed to mental disorders,

83
0:03:51.477,000 --> 0:03:53,000
neuropsychiatric syndromes.

84
0:03:53.861,000 --> 0:03:55,000
You're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense.

85
0:03:56.013,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I mean, cancer seems far more serious.

86
0:03:58.685,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Heart disease seems far more serious.

87
0:04:01.717,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But you can see actually they are further down this list,

88
0:04:04.757,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and that's because we're talking here about disability.

89
0:04:07.037,000 --> 0:04:09,000
What drives the disability for these disorders

90
0:04:09.829,000 --> 0:04:12,000
like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression?

91
0:04:13.733,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Why are they number one here?

92
0:04:16.708,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Well, there are probably three reasons.

93
0:04:18.217,000 --> 0:04:19,000
One is that they're highly prevalent.

94
0:04:20.189,000 --> 0:04:23,000
About one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders

95
0:04:23.484,000 --> 0:04:25,000
in the course of their lifetime.

96
0:04:26.061,000 --> 0:04:28,000
A second, of course, is that, for some people,

97
0:04:28.381,000 --> 0:04:29,000
these become truly disabling,

98
0:04:29.965,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and it's about four to five percent, perhaps one in 20.

99
0:04:33.093,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But what really drives these numbers, this high morbidity,

100
0:04:37.357,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and to some extent the high mortality,

101
0:04:39.786,000 --> 0:04:42,000
is the fact that these start very early in life.

102
0:04:43.734,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Fifty percent will have onset by age 14,

103
0:04:46.829,000 --> 0:04:49,000
75 percent by age 24,

104
0:04:49.949,000 --> 0:04:52,000
a picture that is very different than what one would see

105
0:04:53.414,000 --> 0:04:55,000
if you're talking about cancer or heart disease,

106
0:04:55.685,000 --> 0:04:58,000
diabetes, hypertension -- most of the major illnesses

107
0:04:59.085,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality.

108
0:05:03.181,000 --> 0:05:09,000
These are, indeed, the chronic disorders of young people.

109
0:05:09.491,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Now, I started by telling you that there were some good-news stories.

110
0:05:12.358,000 --> 0:05:13,000
This is obviously not one of them.

111
0:05:13.806,000 --> 0:05:15,000
This is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult,

112
0:05:16.685,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and in a sense this is a kind of confession for me.

113
0:05:19.269,000 --> 0:05:24,000
My job is to actually make sure that we make progress

114
0:05:24.621,000 --> 0:05:26,000
on all of these disorders.

115
0:05:26.973,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I work for the federal government.

116
0:05:28.683,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Actually, I work for you. You pay my salary.

117
0:05:30.701,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And maybe at this point, when you know what I do,

118
0:05:33.085,000 --> 0:05:35,000
or maybe what I've failed to do,

119
0:05:35.205,000 --> 0:05:37,000
you'll think that I probably ought to be fired,

120
0:05:37.414,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and I could certainly understand that.

121
0:05:39.569,000 --> 0:05:41,000
But what I want to suggest, and the reason I'm here

122
0:05:41.901,000 --> 0:05:44,000
is to tell you that I think we're about to be

123
0:05:45.156,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in a very different world as we think about these illnesses.

124
0:05:49.819,000 --> 0:05:52,000
What I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders,

125
0:05:52.925,000 --> 0:05:53,000
diseases of the mind.

126
0:05:54.641,000 --> 0:05:57,000
That's actually becoming a rather unpopular term these days,

127
0:05:58.037,000 --> 0:06:,000
and people feel that, for whatever reason,

128
0:06:00.237,000 --> 0:06:03,000
it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders

129
0:06:03.614,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and to talk about these as disorders of behavior.

130
0:06:07.525,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Fair enough. They are disorders of behavior,

131
0:06:09.792,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and they are disorders of the mind.

132
0:06:11.792,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But what I want to suggest to you

133
0:06:14.197,000 --> 0:06:15,000
is that both of those terms,

134
0:06:15.949,000 --> 0:06:18,000
which have been in play for a century or more,

135
0:06:18.967,000 --> 0:06:2,000
are actually now impediments to progress,

136
0:06:21.787,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that what we need conceptually to make progress here

137
0:06:26.117,000 --> 0:06:31,000
is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders.

138
0:06:31.325,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Now, for some of you, you're going to say,

139
0:06:33.187,000 --> 0:06:35,000
"Oh my goodness, here we go again.

140
0:06:35.406,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance

141
0:06:38.034,000 --> 0:06:39,000
or we're going to hear about drugs

142
0:06:39.769,000 --> 0:06:43,000
or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion

143
0:06:44.595,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that will take our subjective experience

144
0:06:47.535,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and turn it into molecules, or maybe into some sort of

145
0:06:53.607,000 --> 0:06:56,000
very flat, unidimensional understanding

146
0:06:56.825,000 --> 0:07:,000
of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia.

147
0:07:00.927,000 --> 0:07:04,000
When we talk about the brain, it is anything but

148
0:07:05.425,000 --> 0:07:08,000
unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic.

149
0:07:08.688,000 --> 0:07:1,000
It depends, of course, on what scale

150
0:07:11.647,000 --> 0:07:13,000
or what scope you want to think about,

151
0:07:13.943,000 --> 0:07:19,000
but this is an organ of surreal complexity,

152
0:07:20.223,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and we are just beginning to understand

153
0:07:23.694,000 --> 0:07:25,000
how to even study it, whether you're thinking about

154
0:07:25.867,000 --> 0:07:27,000
the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex

155
0:07:28.449,000 --> 0:07:3,000
or the 100 trillion synapses

156
0:07:30.594,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that make up all the connections.

157
0:07:32.953,000 --> 0:07:35,000
We have just begun to try to figure out

158
0:07:36.529,000 --> 0:07:39,000
how do we take this very complex machine

159
0:07:40.057,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that does extraordinary kinds of information processing

160
0:07:42.801,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and use our own minds to understand

161
0:07:45.518,000 --> 0:07:48,000
this very complex brain that supports our own minds.

162
0:07:49.049,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution

163
0:07:51.609,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that we simply don't have a brain

164
0:07:55.439,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that seems to be wired well enough to understand itself.

165
0:07:58.337,000 --> 0:08:,000
In a sense, it actually makes you feel that

166
0:08:00.651,000 --> 0:08:02,000
when you're in the safe zone of studying behavior or cognition,

167
0:08:03.489,000 --> 0:08:04,000
something you can observe,

168
0:08:04.812,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic

169
0:08:07.817,000 --> 0:08:11,000
than trying to engage this very complex, mysterious organ

170
0:08:12.785,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that we're beginning to try to understand.

171
0:08:15.213,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Now, already in the case of the brain disorders

172
0:08:18.869,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that I've been talking to you about,

173
0:08:20.597,000 --> 0:08:22,000
depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,

174
0:08:22.87,000 --> 0:08:24,000
post-traumatic stress disorder,

175
0:08:25.032,000 --> 0:08:27,000
while we don't have an in-depth understanding

176
0:08:27.974,000 --> 0:08:3,000
of how they are abnormally processed

177
0:08:31.7,000 --> 0:08:33,000
or what the brain is doing in these illnesses,

178
0:08:33.805,000 --> 0:08:36,000
we have been able to already identify

179
0:08:36.86,000 --> 0:08:38,000
some of the connectional differences, or some of the ways

180
0:08:39.436,000 --> 0:08:41,000
in which the circuitry is different

181
0:08:41.94,000 --> 0:08:42,000
for people who have these disorders.

182
0:08:43.756,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We call this the human connectome,

183
0:08:45.514,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and you can think about the connectome

184
0:08:47.895,000 --> 0:08:48,000
sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain.

185
0:08:49.767,000 --> 0:08:51,000
You'll hear more about this in a few minutes.

186
0:08:51.871,000 --> 0:08:53,000
The important piece here is that as you begin to look

187
0:08:54.822,000 --> 0:08:57,000
at people who have these disorders, the one in five of us

188
0:08:58.799,000 --> 0:08:59,000
who struggle in some way,

189
0:09:00.627,000 --> 0:09:02,000
you find that there's a lot of variation

190
0:09:02.915,000 --> 0:09:05,000
in the way that the brain is wired,

191
0:09:06.131,000 --> 0:09:08,000
but there are some predictable patterns, and those patterns

192
0:09:08.733,000 --> 0:09:11,000
are risk factors for developing one of these disorders.

193
0:09:12.547,000 --> 0:09:14,000
It's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders

194
0:09:15.539,000 --> 0:09:17,000
like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease

195
0:09:18.307,000 --> 0:09:2,000
where you have a bombed-out part of your cortex.

196
0:09:20.699,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Here we're talking about traffic jams, or sometimes detours,

197
0:09:23.959,000 --> 0:09:25,000
or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected

198
0:09:26.706,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and the way that the brain functions.

199
0:09:27.953,000 --> 0:09:3,000
You could, if you want, compare this to,

200
0:09:31.123,000 --> 0:09:34,000
on the one hand, a myocardial infarction, a heart attack,

201
0:09:34.172,000 --> 0:09:35,000
where you have dead tissue in the heart,

202
0:09:35.995,000 --> 0:09:38,000
versus an arrhythmia, where the organ simply isn't functioning

203
0:09:39.592,000 --> 0:09:41,000
because of the communication problems within it.

204
0:09:41.843,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Either one would kill you; in only one of them

205
0:09:43.812,000 --> 0:09:45,000
will you find a major lesion.

206
0:09:46.412,000 --> 0:09:48,000
As we think about this, probably it's better to actually go

207
0:09:49.244,000 --> 0:09:52,000
a little deeper into one particular disorder, and that would be schizophrenia,

208
0:09:52.467,000 --> 0:09:54,000
because I think that's a good case

209
0:09:54.603,000 --> 0:09:57,000
for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters.

210
0:09:58.128,000 --> 0:10:01,000
These are scans from Judy Rapoport and her colleagues

211
0:10:02.006,000 --> 0:10:04,000
at the National Institute of Mental Health

212
0:10:04.178,000 --> 0:10:07,000
in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia,

213
0:10:07.894,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and you can see already in the top

214
0:10:09.364,000 --> 0:10:11,000
there's areas that are red or orange, yellow,

215
0:10:11.901,000 --> 0:10:13,000
are places where there's less gray matter,

216
0:10:14.039,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and as they followed them over five years,

217
0:10:15.577,000 --> 0:10:17,000
comparing them to age match controls,

218
0:10:17.815,000 --> 0:10:18,000
you can see that, particularly in areas like

219
0:10:19.637,000 --> 0:10:21,000
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

220
0:10:21.953,000 --> 0:10:25,000
or the superior temporal gyrus, there's a profound loss of gray matter.

221
0:10:26.283,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And it's important, if you try to model this,

222
0:10:27.826,000 --> 0:10:28,000
you can think about normal development

223
0:10:29.782,000 --> 0:10:32,000
as a loss of cortical mass, loss of cortical gray matter,

224
0:10:33.035,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that mark,

225
0:10:36.699,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and at some point, when you overshoot,

226
0:10:38.268,000 --> 0:10:4,000
you cross a threshold, and it's that threshold

227
0:10:41.259,000 --> 0:10:44,000
where we say, this is a person who has this disease,

228
0:10:44.835,000 --> 0:10:46,000
because they have the behavioral symptoms

229
0:10:47.123,000 --> 0:10:49,000
of hallucinations and delusions.

230
0:10:49.244,000 --> 0:10:5,000
That's something we can observe.

231
0:10:50.721,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold.

232
0:10:56.363,000 --> 0:10:58,000
They've crossed a brain threshold much earlier,

233
0:10:59.359,000 --> 0:11:02,000
that perhaps not at age 22 or 20,

234
0:11:02.499,000 --> 0:11:04,000
but even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see

235
0:11:05.267,000 --> 0:11:07,000
the trajectory for development is quite different

236
0:11:07.627,000 --> 0:11:1,000
at the level of the brain, not at the level of behavior.

237
0:11:11.142,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Why does this matter? Well first because,

238
0:11:13.237,000 --> 0:11:16,000
for brain disorders, behavior is the last thing to change.

239
0:11:16.379,000 --> 0:11:18,000
We know that for Alzheimer's, for Parkinson's, for Huntington's.

240
0:11:19.289,000 --> 0:11:21,000
There are changes in the brain a decade or more

241
0:11:21.723,000 --> 0:11:26,000
before you see the first signs of a behavioral change.

242
0:11:26.763,000 --> 0:11:28,000
The tools that we have now allow us to detect

243
0:11:29.707,000 --> 0:11:33,000
these brain changes much earlier, long before the symptoms emerge.

244
0:11:34.004,000 --> 0:11:37,000
But most important, go back to where we started.

245
0:11:37.403,000 --> 0:11:4,000
The good-news stories in medicine

246
0:11:40.619,000 --> 0:11:42,000
are early detection, early intervention.

247
0:11:43.563,000 --> 0:11:46,000
If we waited until the heart attack,

248
0:11:47.227,000 --> 0:11:5,000
we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives

249
0:11:51.202,000 --> 0:11:53,000
every year in this country to heart disease.

250
0:11:53.611,000 --> 0:11:55,000
That is precisely what we do today

251
0:11:56.019,000 --> 0:12:,000
when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders,

252
0:12:00.531,000 --> 0:12:03,000
brain circuit disorders, has a behavioral disorder.

253
0:12:03.733,000 --> 0:12:06,000
We wait until the behavior becomes manifest.

254
0:12:06.957,000 --> 0:12:1,000
That's not early detection. That's not early intervention.

255
0:12:11.516,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Now to be clear, we're not quite ready to do this.

256
0:12:13.321,000 --> 0:12:16,000
We don't have all the facts. We don't actually even know

257
0:12:16.475,000 --> 0:12:18,000
what the tools will be,

258
0:12:19.024,000 --> 0:12:23,000
nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able

259
0:12:23.283,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to get there before the behavior emerges as different.

260
0:12:27.488,000 --> 0:12:29,000
But this tells us how we need to think about it,

261
0:12:30.425,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and where we need to go.

262
0:12:31.914,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Are we going to be there soon?

263
0:12:33.116,000 --> 0:12:35,000
I think that this is something that will happen

264
0:12:35.794,000 --> 0:12:37,000
over the course of the next few years, but I'd like to finish

265
0:12:38.625,000 --> 0:12:4,000
with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen

266
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
by somebody who's thought a lot about changes

267
0:12:43.521,000 --> 0:12:45,000
in concepts and changes in technology.

268
0:12:45.849,000 --> 0:12:47,000
"We always overestimate the change that will occur

269
0:12:48.113,000 --> 0:12:5,000
in the next two years and underestimate

270
0:12:50.336,000 --> 0:12:53,000
the change that will occur in the next 10." -- Bill Gates.

271
0:12:54.212,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Thanks very much.

272
0:12:55.575,000 --> 0:12:57,000

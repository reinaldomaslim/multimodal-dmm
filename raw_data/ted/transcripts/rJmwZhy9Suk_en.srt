1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I bet all of you are familiar with this view of the ocean,

2
0:00:17.28,000 --> 0:00:18,000
but the thing is,

3
0:00:18.56,000 --> 0:00:2,000
most of the ocean looks nothing like this.

4
0:00:21.48,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Below the sunlit surface waters,

5
0:00:23.88,000 --> 0:00:25,000
there's an otherworldly realm

6
0:00:25.92,000 --> 0:00:26,000
known as the twilight zone.

7
0:00:28.52,000 --> 0:00:31,000
At 200 to 1,000 meters below the surface,

8
0:00:31.8,000 --> 0:00:33,000
sunlight is barely a glimmer.

9
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Tiny particles swirl down through the darkness

10
0:00:37.28,000 --> 0:00:39,000
while flashes of bioluminescence

11
0:00:39.84,000 --> 0:00:43,000
give us a clue that these waters teem with life:

12
0:00:44.159,000 --> 0:00:46,000
microbes, plankton, fish.

13
0:00:46.6,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Everything that lives here has amazing adaptations

14
0:00:49.88,000 --> 0:00:52,000
for the challenges of such an extreme environment.

15
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
These animals help support top predators such as whales, tuna,

16
0:00:58,000 --> 0:00:59,000
swordfish and sharks.

17
0:01:00.72,000 --> 0:01:02,000
There could be 10 times more fish biomass here

18
0:01:03.52,000 --> 0:01:04,000
than previously thought.

19
0:01:05.2,000 --> 0:01:08,000
In fact, maybe more than all the rest of the ocean combined.

20
0:01:10.44,000 --> 0:01:14,000
There are countless undiscovered species in deep waters,

21
0:01:14.88,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and life in the twilight zone is intertwined with earth's climate.

22
0:01:20.76,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Yet the twilight zone is virtually unexplored.

23
0:01:24.28,000 --> 0:01:26,000
There are so many things we still don't know about it.

24
0:01:27.76,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I think we can change that.

25
0:01:30.32,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I was drawn to oceanography by just this kind of challenge.

26
0:01:34.32,000 --> 0:01:36,000
To me it represents the perfect intersection

27
0:01:36.52,000 --> 0:01:39,000
of science, technology and the unknown,

28
0:01:39.68,000 --> 0:01:43,000
the spark for so many breakthrough discoveries about life on our planet.

29
0:01:46.08,000 --> 0:01:47,000
As a college student,

30
0:01:47.84,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I went on an expedition across the Atlantic

31
0:01:50.56,000 --> 0:01:53,000
with a team of scientists using a high-powered laser

32
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
to measure microscopic algae.

33
0:01:57.2,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The wild thing that happened on that trip

34
0:01:59.44,000 --> 0:02:03,000
is that we discovered what everyone who looked before had completely missed:

35
0:02:04.76,000 --> 0:02:07,000
photosynthetic cells smaller than anyone thought possible.

36
0:02:09.68,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We now know those tiny cells are the most abundant

37
0:02:12.64,000 --> 0:02:14,000
photosynthetic organisms on earth.

38
0:02:15.88,000 --> 0:02:19,000
This amazing discovery happened because we used new technology

39
0:02:20.36,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to see life in the ocean in a new way.

40
0:02:24.28,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I am convinced that the discoveries awaiting us in the twilight zone

41
0:02:28.64,000 --> 0:02:3,000
will be just as breathtaking.

42
0:02:32.12,000 --> 0:02:36,000
We know so little about the twilight zone because it's difficult to study.

43
0:02:36.32,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It's exceedingly large,

44
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
spanning from the Arctic to the Southern Ocean

45
0:02:40.36,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and around the globe.

46
0:02:41.72,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It's different from place to place.

47
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It changes quickly as the water and animals move.

48
0:02:47.44,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And it's deep and dark and cold, and the pressures there are enormous.

49
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:55,000
What we do know is fascinating.

50
0:02:56.2,000 --> 0:03:,000
You may be imagining huge monsters lurking in the deep sea,

51
0:03:01.12,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but most of the animals are very small,

52
0:03:06.2,000 --> 0:03:08,000
like this lantern fish.

53
0:03:11.56,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And this fierce-looking fish is called a bristlemouth.

54
0:03:15.12,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Believe it or not, these are the most abundant vertebrates on earth

55
0:03:19.08,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and many are so small that a dozen could fit in this one tube.

56
0:03:25.08,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It gets even more interesting,

57
0:03:27.08,000 --> 0:03:32,000
because small size does not stop them from being powerful through sheer number.

58
0:03:32.8,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Deep, penetrating sonar shows us that the animals form dense layers.

59
0:03:37.4,000 --> 0:03:39,000
You can see what I mean by the red and yellow colors

60
0:03:39.88,000 --> 0:03:41,000
around 400 meters in these data.

61
0:03:42.6,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So much sound bounces off this layer,

62
0:03:44.6,000 --> 0:03:46,000
it's been mistaken for the ocean bottom.

63
0:03:48.2,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But if we look, it can't be, because the layer is deep during the day,

64
0:03:52.72,000 --> 0:03:54,000
it rises up at night

65
0:03:54.76,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and the pattern repeats day after day.

66
0:03:58.28,000 --> 0:04:02,000
This is actually the largest animal migration on earth.

67
0:04:02.68,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It happens around the globe every day,

68
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
sweeping through the world's oceans in a massive living wave

69
0:04:08.92,000 --> 0:04:1,000
as twilight zone inhabitants travel hundreds of meters

70
0:04:11.68,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to surface waters to feed at night

71
0:04:14.32,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and return to the relative safety of deeper, darker waters during the day.

72
0:04:19.4,000 --> 0:04:24,000
These animals and their movements help connect the surface and deep ocean

73
0:04:24.64,000 --> 0:04:25,000
in important ways.

74
0:04:26.96,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The animals feed near the surface,

75
0:04:29.72,000 --> 0:04:32,000
they bring carbon in their food into the deep waters,

76
0:04:33.519,000 --> 0:04:35,000
where some of that carbon can stay behind

77
0:04:36.36,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and remain isolated from the atmosphere for hundreds or even thousands of years.

78
0:04:43.72,000 --> 0:04:48,000
In this way, the migration may help keep carbon dioxide

79
0:04:48.8,000 --> 0:04:49,000
out of our atmosphere

80
0:04:50.48,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and limit the effects of global warming on our climate.

81
0:04:55.48,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But we still have many questions.

82
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We don't know which species are migrating,

83
0:04:59.44,000 --> 0:05:,000
what they're finding to eat,

84
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:02,000
who is trying to eat them

85
0:05:02.8,000 --> 0:05:05,000
or how much carbon they are able to transport.

86
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So I'm a scientist who studies life in the ocean.

87
0:05:11.96,000 --> 0:05:14,000
For me, curiosity about these things is a powerful driver,

88
0:05:16.6,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but there's more to the motivation here.

89
0:05:20.04,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We need to answer these questions and answer them quickly,

90
0:05:23.76,000 --> 0:05:25,000
because the twilight zone is under threat.

91
0:05:27.2,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Factory ships in the open ocean

92
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
have been vacuuming up

93
0:05:30.6,000 --> 0:05:33,000
hundreds of thousands of tons of small, shrimp-like animals called krill.

94
0:05:35.28,000 --> 0:05:36,000
The animals are ground into fish meal

95
0:05:37.2,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to support increasing demands for aquaculture

96
0:05:40.44,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and for nutraceuticals such as krill oil.

97
0:05:43.44,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Industry is on the brink of deepening fisheries such as these

98
0:05:46.76,000 --> 0:05:47,000
into the mid-water

99
0:05:48.48,000 --> 0:05:51,000
in what could start a kind of twilight zone gold rush

100
0:05:51.92,000 --> 0:05:55,000
operating outside the reach of national fishing regulations.

101
0:05:57.08,000 --> 0:06:,000
This could have irreversible global-scale impacts

102
0:06:00.68,000 --> 0:06:02,000
on marine life and food webs.

103
0:06:04.28,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We need to get out ahead of fishing impacts

104
0:06:07.04,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and work to understand this critical part of the ocean.

105
0:06:10.84,000 --> 0:06:11,000
At Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,

106
0:06:12.8,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I'm really fortunate to be surrounded by colleagues who share this passion.

107
0:06:17.64,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Together, we are ready to launch a large-scale exploration

108
0:06:21.36,000 --> 0:06:22,000
of the twilight zone.

109
0:06:23.2,000 --> 0:06:25,000
We have a plan to begin right away

110
0:06:25.24,000 --> 0:06:26,000
with expeditions in the North Atlantic,

111
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
where we'll tackle the big challenges

112
0:06:29.28,000 --> 0:06:33,000
of observing and studying the twilight zone's remarkable diversity.

113
0:06:34.36,000 --> 0:06:38,000
This kind of multiscale, multidimensional exploration

114
0:06:38.6,000 --> 0:06:4,000
means we need to integrate new technologies.

115
0:06:42.36,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Let me show you a recent example that has changed our thinking.

116
0:06:46.92,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Satellite tracking devices on animals such as sharks

117
0:06:50.64,000 --> 0:06:52,000
are now showing us that many top predators

118
0:06:53.52,000 --> 0:06:55,000
regularly dive deep into the twilight zone to feed.

119
0:06:57.24,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And when we map their swimming patterns and compare them to satellite data,

120
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
we find that their feeding hot spots

121
0:07:04.2,000 --> 0:07:06,000
are linked to ocean currents and other features.

122
0:07:08.48,000 --> 0:07:12,000
We used to think these animals found all of their food in surface waters.

123
0:07:13.48,000 --> 0:07:16,000
We now believe they depend on the twilight zone.

124
0:07:17.68,000 --> 0:07:2,000
But we still need to figure out how they find the best areas to feed,

125
0:07:21.48,000 --> 0:07:22,000
what they're eating there

126
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and how much their diets depend on twilight zone species.

127
0:07:28.24,000 --> 0:07:32,000
We will also need new technologies to explore the links with climate.

128
0:07:33.28,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Remember these particles?

129
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Some of them are produced by gelatinous animals called salps.

130
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Salps are like superefficient vacuum cleaners,

131
0:07:42.56,000 --> 0:07:47,000
slurping up plankton and producing fast-sinking pellets of poop --

132
0:07:48.28,000 --> 0:07:5,000
try saying that 10 times fast --

133
0:07:50.44,000 --> 0:07:53,000
pellets of poop that carry carbon deep into the ocean.

134
0:07:54.68,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We sometimes find salps in enormous swarms.

135
0:07:58.28,000 --> 0:08:01,000
We need to know where and when and why and whether

136
0:08:02.2,000 --> 0:08:05,000
this kind of carbon sink has a big impact on earth's climate.

137
0:08:07.4,000 --> 0:08:1,000
To meet these challenges, we will need to push the limits of technology.

138
0:08:11.92,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We will deploy cameras and samplers on smart robots

139
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to patrol the depths and help us track the secret lives of animals like salps.

140
0:08:20.52,000 --> 0:08:22,000
We will use advanced sonar

141
0:08:22.6,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to figure out how many fish and other animals are down there.

142
0:08:27.28,000 --> 0:08:31,000
We will sequence DNA from the environment in a kind of forensic analysis

143
0:08:31.72,000 --> 0:08:33,000
to figure out which species are there

144
0:08:33.96,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and what they are eating.

145
0:08:36.52,000 --> 0:08:39,000
With so much that's still unknown about the twilight zone,

146
0:08:39.96,000 --> 0:08:42,000
there's an almost unlimited opportunity for new discovery.

147
0:08:44.36,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Just look at these beautiful, fascinating creatures.

148
0:08:48.159,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We barely know them.

149
0:08:50.28,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And imagine how many more are just down there waiting

150
0:08:53.12,000 --> 0:08:55,000
for our new technologies to see them.

151
0:08:56.4,000 --> 0:08:59,000
The excitement level about this could not be higher on our team

152
0:08:59.84,000 --> 0:09:02,000
of ocean scientists, engineers and communicators.

153
0:09:04.8,000 --> 0:09:06,000
There is also a deep sense of urgency.

154
0:09:08.4,000 --> 0:09:12,000
We can't turn back the clock on decades of overfishing

155
0:09:12.72,000 --> 0:09:14,000
in countless regions of the ocean

156
0:09:15.28,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that once seemed inexhaustible.

157
0:09:18.24,000 --> 0:09:22,000
How amazing would it be to take a different path this time?

158
0:09:23.56,000 --> 0:09:26,000
The twilight zone is truly a global commons.

159
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
We need to first know and understand it

160
0:09:30.36,000 --> 0:09:32,000
before we can be responsible stewards

161
0:09:33.24,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and hope to fish it sustainably.

162
0:09:36.24,000 --> 0:09:38,000
This is not just a journey for scientists,

163
0:09:38.84,000 --> 0:09:39,000
it is for all of us,

164
0:09:40.8,000 --> 0:09:42,000
because the decisions we collectively make

165
0:09:43.76,000 --> 0:09:44,000
over the next decade

166
0:09:45.68,000 --> 0:09:47,000
will affect what the ocean looks like

167
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
for centuries to come.

168
0:09:50.6,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Thank you.

169
0:09:51.84,000 --> 0:09:56,000

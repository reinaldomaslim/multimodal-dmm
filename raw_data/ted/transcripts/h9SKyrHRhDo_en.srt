2
0:00:12.428,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The world's largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project

3
0:00:17.733,000 --> 0:00:2,000
is situated in the heart of the largest and most intact forest in the world,

4
0:00:21.598,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Canada's boreal forest.

5
0:00:23.426,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It stretches right across Northern Canada, in Labrador,

6
0:00:27.873,000 --> 0:00:3,000
it's home to the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world:

7
0:00:31.07,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the George River caribou herd,

8
0:00:32.565,000 --> 0:00:34,000
numbering approximately 400,000 animals.

9
0:00:34.758,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Unfortunately, when I was there, I couldn't find one of them,

10
0:00:37.64,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but you have the antlers as proof.

11
0:00:39.949,000 --> 0:00:4,000
All across the boreal,

12
0:00:41.351,000 --> 0:00:44,000
we're blessed with this incredible abundance of wetlands.

13
0:00:44.769,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Wetlands, globally, are one of the most endangered ecosystems.

14
0:00:49.126,000 --> 0:00:51,000
They're absolutely critical ecosystems,

15
0:00:52.032,000 --> 0:00:54,000
they clean air, they clean water,

16
0:00:54.637,000 --> 0:00:57,000
they sequester large amounts of greenhouse gases,

17
0:00:57.73,000 --> 0:01:,000
and they're home to a huge diversity of species.

18
0:01:01.155,000 --> 0:01:03,000
In the boreal, they are also the home

19
0:01:03.536,000 --> 0:01:07,000
where almost 50 percent of the 800 bird species found in North America

20
0:01:07.911,000 --> 0:01:09,000
migrate north to breed and raise their young.

21
0:01:12.571,000 --> 0:01:17,000
In Ontario, the boreal marches down south to the north shore of Lake Superior.

22
0:01:18.032,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And these incredibly beautiful boreal forests

23
0:01:21.569,000 --> 0:01:24,000
were the inspiration for some of the most famous art in Canadian history,

24
0:01:25.538,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the Group of Seven were very inspired by this landscape,

25
0:01:29.892,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and so the boreal is not just a really key part of our natural heritage,

26
0:01:35.274,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but also an important part of our cultural heritage.

27
0:01:38.566,000 --> 0:01:41,000
In Manitoba, this is an image from the east side of Lake Winnipeg,

28
0:01:42.538,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and this is the home of the newly designated UNESCO Cultural Heritage site.

29
0:01:48.531,000 --> 0:01:51,000
In Saskatchewan, as across all of the boreal,

30
0:01:51.573,000 --> 0:01:53,000
home to some of our most famous rivers,

31
0:01:54.01,000 --> 0:01:59,000
an incredible network of rivers and lakes that every school-age child learns about,

32
0:01:59.09,000 --> 0:02:02,000
the Peace, the Athabasca, the Churchill here, the Mackenzie,

33
0:02:03.019,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and these networks were the historical routes

34
0:02:06.874,000 --> 0:02:08,000
for the voyageur and the coureur de bois,

35
0:02:09.122,000 --> 0:02:12,000
the first non-aboriginal explorers of Northern Canada

36
0:02:12.453,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that, taking from the First Nations people,

37
0:02:15.236,000 --> 0:02:17,000
used canoes and paddled to explore

38
0:02:17.64,000 --> 0:02:2,000
for a trade route, a Northwest Passage for the fur trade.

39
0:02:21.954,000 --> 0:02:24,000
In the North, the boreal is bordered by the tundra,

40
0:02:25.609,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and just below that, in Yukon,

41
0:02:28.656,000 --> 0:02:31,000
we have this incredible valley, the Tombstone Valley.

42
0:02:32.158,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And the Tombstone Valley is home to the Porcupine caribou herd.

43
0:02:36.868,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Now you've probably heard about the Porcupine caribou herd

44
0:02:39.61,000 --> 0:02:42,000
in the context of its breeding ground in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

45
0:02:43.186,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Well, the wintering ground is also critical

46
0:02:45.432,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and it also is not protected,

47
0:02:48.057,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and is potentially, could be potentially, exploited for gas and mineral rights.

48
0:02:54.855,000 --> 0:02:56,000
The western border of the boreal in British Columbia

49
0:02:57.333,000 --> 0:02:58,000
is marked by the Coast Mountains,

50
0:02:58.974,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and on the other side of those mountains

51
0:03:00.969,000 --> 0:03:02,000
is the greatest remaining temperate rainforest in the world,

52
0:03:03.821,000 --> 0:03:04,000
the Great Bear Rainforest,

53
0:03:05.187,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and we'll discuss that in a few minutes in a bit more detail.

54
0:03:08.071,000 --> 0:03:09,000
All across the boreal,

55
0:03:09.525,000 --> 0:03:13,000
it's home for a huge incredible range of indigenous peoples,

56
0:03:14.543,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and a rich and varied culture.

57
0:03:17.616,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And I think that one of the reasons

58
0:03:20.146,000 --> 0:03:23,000
why so many of these groups have retained a link to the past,

59
0:03:23.644,000 --> 0:03:25,000
know their native languages,

60
0:03:25.68,000 --> 0:03:27,000
the songs, the dances, the traditions,

61
0:03:28.042,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I think part of that reason is because of the remoteness,

62
0:03:31.577,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the span and the wilderness

63
0:03:32.903,000 --> 0:03:35,000
of this almost 95 percent intact ecosystem.

64
0:03:37.033,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And I think particularly now,

65
0:03:38.667,000 --> 0:03:41,000
as we see ourselves in a time of environmental crisis,

66
0:03:41.823,000 --> 0:03:42,000
we can learn so much from these people

67
0:03:43.76,000 --> 0:03:45,000
who have lived so sustainably in this ecosystem

68
0:03:46.009,000 --> 0:03:47,000
for over 10,000 years.

69
0:03:49.496,000 --> 0:03:52,000
In the heart of this ecosystem is the very antithesis

70
0:03:52.557,000 --> 0:03:54,000
of all of these values that we've been talking about,

71
0:03:55.06,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and I think these are some of the core values

72
0:03:57.222,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that make us proud to be Canadians.

73
0:03:58.924,000 --> 0:03:59,000
This is the Alberta tar sands,

74
0:04:00.764,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the largest oil reserves on the planet outside of Saudi Arabia.

75
0:04:05.39,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Trapped underneath the boreal forest and wetlands of northern Alberta

76
0:04:09.31,000 --> 0:04:12,000
are these vast reserves of this sticky, tar-like bitumen.

77
0:04:13.631,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And the mining and the exploitation of that

78
0:04:16.241,000 --> 0:04:2,000
is creating devastation on a scale that the planet has never seen before.

79
0:04:22.715,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I want to try to convey some sort of a sense of the size of this.

80
0:04:26.889,000 --> 0:04:27,000
If you look at that truck there,

81
0:04:28.86,000 --> 0:04:3,000
it is the largest truck of its kind on the planet.

82
0:04:31.3,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It is a 400-ton-capacity dump truck

83
0:04:34.07,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and its dimensions are 45 feet long by 35 feet wide and 25 feet high.

84
0:04:41.254,000 --> 0:04:42,000
If I stand beside that truck,

85
0:04:42.714,000 --> 0:04:45,000
my head comes to around the bottom of the yellow part of that hubcap.

86
0:04:46.616,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Within the dimensions of that truck,

87
0:04:48.709,000 --> 0:04:52,000
you could build a 3,000-square-foot two-story home quite easily.

88
0:04:52.998,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I did the math.

89
0:04:54.553,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So instead of thinking of that as a truck, think of that as a 3,000-square-foot home.

90
0:04:59.802,000 --> 0:05:,000
That's not a bad size home.

91
0:05:01.722,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And line those trucks / homes back and forth

92
0:05:05.103,000 --> 0:05:09,000
across there from the bottom all the way to the top.

93
0:05:09.993,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And then think of how large that very small section of one mine is.

94
0:05:15.9,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Now, you can apply that same kind of thinking here as well.

95
0:05:19.492,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Now, here you see -- of course, as you go further on,

96
0:05:22.225,000 --> 0:05:23,000
these trucks become like a pixel.

97
0:05:24.505,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Again, imagine those all back and forth there.

98
0:05:27.921,000 --> 0:05:29,000
How large is that one portion of a mine?

99
0:05:31.79,000 --> 0:05:35,000
That would be a huge, vast metropolitan area,

100
0:05:36.15,000 --> 0:05:38,000
probably much larger than the city of Victoria.

101
0:05:38.526,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And this is just one of a number of mines,

102
0:05:42.376,000 --> 0:05:44,000
10 mines so far right now.

103
0:05:44.584,000 --> 0:05:46,000
This is one section of one mining complex,

104
0:05:47.214,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and there are about another 40 or 50 in the approval process.

105
0:05:51.077,000 --> 0:05:53,000
No tar sands mine has actually ever been denied approval,

106
0:05:53.861,000 --> 0:05:55,000
so it is essentially a rubber stamp.

107
0:05:57.498,000 --> 0:05:59,000
The other method of extraction is what's called the in situ.

108
0:06:00.463,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And here, massive amounts of water

109
0:06:02.459,000 --> 0:06:05,000
are superheated and pumped through the ground,

110
0:06:05.49,000 --> 0:06:07,000
through these vasts networks of pipelines,

111
0:06:07.602,000 --> 0:06:1,000
seismic lines, drill paths, compressor stations.

112
0:06:11.316,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And even though this looks maybe not quite as repugnant as the mines,

113
0:06:15.483,000 --> 0:06:17,000
it's even more damaging in some ways.

114
0:06:17.684,000 --> 0:06:22,000
It impacts and fragments a larger part of the wilderness,

115
0:06:23.083,000 --> 0:06:25,000
where there is 90 percent reduction of key species,

116
0:06:25.569,000 --> 0:06:27,000
like woodland caribou and grizzly bears,

117
0:06:27.91,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and it consumes even more energy, more water,

118
0:06:31.442,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and produces at least as much greenhouse gas.

119
0:06:34.019,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So these in situ developments are at least as ecologically damaging as the mines.

120
0:06:41.717,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The oil produced from either method

121
0:06:44.382,000 --> 0:06:48,000
produces more greenhouse gas emissions than any other oil.

122
0:06:48.958,000 --> 0:06:51,000
This is one of the reasons why it's called the world's dirtiest oil.

123
0:06:52.596,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It's also one of the reasons

124
0:06:53.973,000 --> 0:06:58,000
why it is the largest and fastest-growing single source of carbon in Canada,

125
0:06:59.193,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and it is also a reason why Canada is now number three

126
0:07:04.139,000 --> 0:07:06,000
in terms of producing carbon per person.

127
0:07:08.778,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The tailings ponds are the largest toxic impoundments on the planet.

128
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Oil sands -- or rather, I should say tar sands --

129
0:07:16.896,000 --> 0:07:18,000
oil sands is a PR-created term

130
0:07:19.205,000 --> 0:07:22,000
so that the oil companies wouldn't be trying to promote something

131
0:07:22.288,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that sounds like a sticky tar-like substance that's the world's dirtiest oil.

132
0:07:26.709,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So they decided to call it oil sands.

133
0:07:29.106,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The tar sands consume more water than any other oil process,

134
0:07:32.952,000 --> 0:07:35,000
three to five barrels of water are taken, polluted

135
0:07:36.263,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and then returned into tailings ponds,

136
0:07:38.583,000 --> 0:07:4,000
the largest toxic impoundments on the planet.

137
0:07:41.084,000 --> 0:07:45,000
SemCrude, just one of the licensees, in just one of their tailings ponds,

138
0:07:45.188,000 --> 0:07:49,000
dumps 250,000 tons of this toxic gunk every single day.

139
0:07:50.739,000 --> 0:07:53,000
That's creating the largest toxic impoundments in the history of the planet.

140
0:07:54.756,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So far, this is enough toxin to cover the face of Lake Erie a foot deep.

141
0:08:01.685,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And the tailings ponds range in size up to 9,000 acres.

142
0:08:06.592,000 --> 0:08:09,000
That's two-thirds the size of the entire island of Manhattan.

143
0:08:10.565,000 --> 0:08:12,000
That's like from Wall Street at the southern edge of Manhattan

144
0:08:13.558,000 --> 0:08:14,000
up to maybe 120th Street.

145
0:08:16.171,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So this is one of the larger tailings ponds.

146
0:08:20.198,000 --> 0:08:23,000
This might be, what? I don't know, half the size of Manhattan.

147
0:08:23.265,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And you can see in the context,

148
0:08:24.782,000 --> 0:08:28,000
it's just a relatively small section of one of 10 mining complexes

149
0:08:29.152,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and another 40 to 50 on stream to be approved soon.

150
0:08:34.398,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And of course, these tailings ponds --

151
0:08:36.978,000 --> 0:08:38,000
well, you can't see many ponds from outer space

152
0:08:39.557,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and you can see these, so maybe we should stop calling them ponds --

153
0:08:43.412,000 --> 0:08:46,000
these massive toxic wastelands are built

154
0:08:47.24,000 --> 0:08:49,000
unlined and on the banks of the Athabasca River.

155
0:08:50.562,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And the Athabasca River drains downstream to a range of aboriginal communities.

156
0:08:54.971,000 --> 0:08:58,000
In Fort Chipewyan, the 800 people there, are finding toxins in the food chain,

157
0:08:59.309,000 --> 0:09:,000
this has been scientifically proven.

158
0:09:01.719,000 --> 0:09:03,000
The tar sands toxins are in the food chain,

159
0:09:03.762,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and this is causing cancer rates up to 10 times

160
0:09:06.697,000 --> 0:09:08,000
what they are in the rest of Canada.

161
0:09:09.767,000 --> 0:09:14,000
In spite of that, people have to live, have to eat this food in order to survive.

162
0:09:15.264,000 --> 0:09:18,000
The incredibly high price of flying food

163
0:09:18.303,000 --> 0:09:2,000
into these remote Northern aboriginal communities

164
0:09:20.916,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and the high rate of unemployment

165
0:09:22.615,000 --> 0:09:24,000
makes this an absolute necessity for survival.

166
0:09:25.709,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And not that many years ago, I was lent a boat by a First Nations man,

167
0:09:29.813,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and he said, "When you go out on the river,

168
0:09:32.064,000 --> 0:09:35,000
do not under any circumstances eat the fish.

169
0:09:35.733,000 --> 0:09:36,000
It's carcinogenic."

170
0:09:37.417,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And yet, on the front porch of that man's cabin,

171
0:09:41.962,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I saw four fish.

172
0:09:43.393,000 --> 0:09:45,000
He had to feed his family to survive.

173
0:09:46.193,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And as a parent, I just can't imagine what that does to your soul.

174
0:09:52.354,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And that's what we're doing.

175
0:09:55.893,000 --> 0:09:59,000
The boreal forest is also perhaps our best defense

176
0:10:00.319,000 --> 0:10:02,000
against global warming and climate change.

177
0:10:03.443,000 --> 0:10:07,000
The boreal forest sequesters more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem.

178
0:10:09.322,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And this is absolutely key.

179
0:10:11.934,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So what we're doing is,

180
0:10:13.828,000 --> 0:10:17,000
we're taking the most concentrated greenhouse gas sink --

181
0:10:19.517,000 --> 0:10:21,000
twice as much greenhouse gases are sequestered

182
0:10:22.074,000 --> 0:10:25,000
in the boreal per acre than the tropical rainforests.

183
0:10:26.088,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And what we're doing is we're destroying

184
0:10:28.589,000 --> 0:10:3,000
this carbon sink, turning it into a carbon bomb.

185
0:10:31.645,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And we're replacing that with the largest industrial project

186
0:10:34.781,000 --> 0:10:35,000
in the history of the world,

187
0:10:36.176,000 --> 0:10:41,000
which is producing the most high-carbon greenhouse-gas emitting oil in the world.

188
0:10:42.976,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And we're doing this on the second largest oil reserves on the planet.

189
0:10:48.183,000 --> 0:10:51,000
This is one of the reasons why Canada, originally a climate change hero --

190
0:10:51.984,000 --> 0:10:54,000
we were one of the first signatories of the Kyoto Accord.

191
0:10:55.372,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Now we're the country that has full-time lobbyists

192
0:10:57.816,000 --> 0:10:59,000
in the European Union and Washington DC,

193
0:11:00.875,000 --> 0:11:01,000
threatening trade wars

194
0:11:02.798,000 --> 0:11:06,000
when these countries talk about wanting to bring in positive legislation

195
0:11:07.548,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to limit the import of high-carbon fuels,

196
0:11:10.583,000 --> 0:11:13,000
of greenhouse gas emissions, anything like this,

197
0:11:13.87,000 --> 0:11:17,000
at international conferences, whether they're in Copenhagen or Cancun,

198
0:11:18.408,000 --> 0:11:2,000
international conferences on climate change,

199
0:11:20.928,000 --> 0:11:23,000
we're the country that gets the dinosaur award every single day,

200
0:11:24.091,000 --> 0:11:27,000
as being the biggest obstacle to progress on this issue.

201
0:11:29.317,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Just 70 miles downstream

202
0:11:31.747,000 --> 0:11:34,000
is the world's largest freshwater delta, the Peace-Athabasca Delta,

203
0:11:35.466,000 --> 0:11:38,000
the only one at the juncture of all four migratory flyways.

204
0:11:39.293,000 --> 0:11:42,000
This is a globally significant wetland, perhaps the greatest on the planet.

205
0:11:43.234,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Incredible habitat for half the bird species

206
0:11:46.967,000 --> 0:11:48,000
you find in North America, migrating here.

207
0:11:50.611,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And also the last refuge for the largest herd of wild bison,

208
0:11:54.869,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and also, of course, critical habitat for another whole range of other species.

209
0:11:59.82,000 --> 0:12:01,000
But it too is being threatened

210
0:12:01.973,000 --> 0:12:04,000
by the massive amount of water being drawn from the Athabasca,

211
0:12:05.637,000 --> 0:12:06,000
which feeds these wetlands,

212
0:12:07.643,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and also the incredible toxic burden

213
0:12:09.76,000 --> 0:12:11,000
of the largest toxic unlined impoundments on the planet,

214
0:12:12.557,000 --> 0:12:15,000
which are leaching in to the food chain for all the species downstream.

215
0:12:17.683,000 --> 0:12:2,000
So as bad as all that is, things are going to get much worse -- much, much worse.

216
0:12:21.652,000 --> 0:12:23,000
This is the infrastructure as we see it about now.

217
0:12:25.141,000 --> 0:12:27,000
This is what's planned for 2015.

218
0:12:28.11,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And you can see here the Keystone Pipeline,

219
0:12:32.168,000 --> 0:12:36,000
which would take tar sands raw down to the Gulf Coast,

220
0:12:36.419,000 --> 0:12:4,000
punching a pipeline through the agricultural heart of North America,

221
0:12:40.726,000 --> 0:12:42,000
of the United States,

222
0:12:43.106,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and securing the contract with the dirtiest fuel in the world

223
0:12:48.435,000 --> 0:12:5,000
by consumption of the United States,

224
0:12:51.403,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and promoting a huge disincentive

225
0:12:54.288,000 --> 0:12:56,000
to a sustainable clean-energy future for America.

226
0:12:58.14,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Here you see the route down the Mackenzie valley.

227
0:13:03.677,000 --> 0:13:06,000
This would put a pipeline to take natural gas from the Beaufort Sea

228
0:13:07.363,000 --> 0:13:11,000
through the heart of the third largest watershed basin in the world,

229
0:13:12.051,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and the only one which is 95 percent intact.

230
0:13:15.231,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And building a pipeline with an industrial highway

231
0:13:18.639,000 --> 0:13:21,000
would change forever this incredible wilderness,

232
0:13:22.151,000 --> 0:13:24,000
which is a true rarity on the planet today.

233
0:13:27.306,000 --> 0:13:31,000
So the Great Bear Rainforest is just over the hill there,

234
0:13:31.575,000 --> 0:13:34,000
within a few miles, we go from these dry boreal forests

235
0:13:34.726,000 --> 0:13:37,000
of 100-year-old trees, maybe 10 inches across,

236
0:13:38.139,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and soon, we're in the coastal temperate rainforest,

237
0:13:40.6,000 --> 0:13:43,000
rain-drenched, 1,000-year-old trees,

238
0:13:44.2,000 --> 0:13:47,000
20 feet across, a completely different ecosystem.

239
0:13:47.278,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And the Great Bear Rainforest is generally considered to be

240
0:13:50.071,000 --> 0:13:53,000
the largest coastal temperate rainforest ecosystem in the world.

241
0:13:54.014,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Some of the greatest densities

242
0:13:55.844,000 --> 0:13:58,000
of some of the most iconic and threatened species on the planet.

243
0:13:59.881,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And yet there's a proposal, of course, to build a pipeline

244
0:14:04.476,000 --> 0:14:07,000
to take huge tankers, 10 times the size of the Exxon Valdez,

245
0:14:08.359,000 --> 0:14:11,000
through some of the most difficult-to-navigate waters in the world,

246
0:14:11.838,000 --> 0:14:14,000
where only just a few years ago, a BC ferry ran aground.

247
0:14:16.202,000 --> 0:14:18,000
When one of these tar sands tankers,

248
0:14:18.579,000 --> 0:14:21,000
carrying the dirtiest oil, 10 times as much as the Exxon Valdez,

249
0:14:21.965,000 --> 0:14:23,000
eventually hits a rock and goes down,

250
0:14:24.298,000 --> 0:14:26,000
we're going to have one of the worst ecological disasters

251
0:14:27.232,000 --> 0:14:28,000
this planet has ever seen.

252
0:14:29.799,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And here we have the plan out to 2030.

253
0:14:32.903,000 --> 0:14:36,000
What they're proposing is an almost four-times increase in production,

254
0:14:37.48,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and that would industrialize an area the size of Florida.

255
0:14:42.271,000 --> 0:14:46,000
In doing so, we'll be removing a large part of our greatest carbon sink

256
0:14:47.127,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and replacing it with the most high greenhouse-gas emission oil in the future.

257
0:14:53.581,000 --> 0:14:56,000
The world does not need any more tar mines.

258
0:14:57.697,000 --> 0:14:59,000
The world does not need any more pipelines

259
0:15:00.661,000 --> 0:15:02,000
to wed our addiction to fossil fuels.

260
0:15:03.841,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And the world certainly does not need

261
0:15:05.857,000 --> 0:15:08,000
the largest toxic impoundments to grow and multiply

262
0:15:08.934,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and further threaten the downstream communities.

263
0:15:11.211,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And let's face it, we all live downstream

264
0:15:13.231,000 --> 0:15:15,000
in an era of global warming and climate change.

265
0:15:17.043,000 --> 0:15:19,000
What we need, is we all need to act

266
0:15:19.825,000 --> 0:15:23,000
to ensure that Canada respects the massive amounts of freshwater

267
0:15:24.521,000 --> 0:15:25,000
that we hold in this country.

268
0:15:26.956,000 --> 0:15:28,000
We need to ensure that these wetlands and forests

269
0:15:29.305,000 --> 0:15:32,000
that are our best and greatest and most critical defense

270
0:15:32.611,000 --> 0:15:34,000
against global warming are protected,

271
0:15:35.097,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and we are not releasing that carbon bomb into the atmosphere.

272
0:15:39.557,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And we need to all gather together and say no to the tar sands.

273
0:15:44.712,000 --> 0:15:45,000
And we can do that.

274
0:15:45.887,000 --> 0:15:47,000
there is a huge network all over the world,

275
0:15:48.794,000 --> 0:15:49,000
fighting to stop this project.

276
0:15:51.04,000 --> 0:15:52,000
And I quite simply think

277
0:15:52.858,000 --> 0:15:55,000
that this is not something that should be decided just in Canada.

278
0:15:56.748,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Everyone in this room, everyone across Canada,

279
0:15:59.052,000 --> 0:16:,000
everyone listening to this presentation

280
0:16:01.037,000 --> 0:16:03,000
has a role to play and, I think, a responsibility.

281
0:16:03.863,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Because what we do here is going to change our history,

282
0:16:09.522,000 --> 0:16:11,000
it's going to color our possibility to survive,

283
0:16:12.239,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and for our children to survive and have a rich future.

284
0:16:17.749,000 --> 0:16:18,000
We have an incredible gift in the boreal,

285
0:16:19.735,000 --> 0:16:24,000
an incredible opportunity to preserve our best defense against global warming,

286
0:16:24.987,000 --> 0:16:25,000
but we could let that slip away.

287
0:16:27.715,000 --> 0:16:3,000
The tar sands could threaten not just a large section of the boreal.

288
0:16:31.717,000 --> 0:16:33,000
It compromises the life and the health

289
0:16:34.714,000 --> 0:16:38,000
of some of our most underprivileged and vulnerable people,

290
0:16:39.262,000 --> 0:16:42,000
the aboriginal communities that have so much to teach us.

291
0:16:43.131,000 --> 0:16:45,000
It could destroy the Athabasca Delta,

292
0:16:45.733,000 --> 0:16:48,000
the largest and possibly greatest freshwater delta in the planet.

293
0:16:50.389,000 --> 0:16:53,000
It could destroy the Great Bear Rainforest,

294
0:16:53.982,000 --> 0:16:55,000
the largest temperate rainforest in the world.

295
0:16:56.817,000 --> 0:16:58,000
And it could have huge impacts

296
0:16:58.849,000 --> 0:17:01,000
on the future of the agricultural heartland of North America.

297
0:17:03.337,000 --> 0:17:06,000
I hope that you will all, if you've been moved by this presentation,

298
0:17:06.555,000 --> 0:17:08,000
join with the growing international community

299
0:17:09.358,000 --> 0:17:12,000
to get Canada to step up to its responsibilities,

300
0:17:12.828,000 --> 0:17:16,000
to convince Canada to go back to being a climate change champion

301
0:17:17.238,000 --> 0:17:18,000
instead of a climate change villain,

302
0:17:18.995,000 --> 0:17:19,000
and to say no to the tar sands,

303
0:17:20.676,000 --> 0:17:22,000
and yes to a clean energy future for all.

304
0:17:23.369,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Thank you so much.

305
0:17:24.717,000 --> 0:17:27,000
(Applause)

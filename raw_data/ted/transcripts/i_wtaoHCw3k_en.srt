1
0:00:13.65,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Come with me to Agbogbloshie,

2
0:00:16.334,000 --> 0:00:18,000
a neighborhood in the heart of Accra,

3
0:00:19.144,000 --> 0:00:22,000
named after a god that lives in the Odaw River.

4
0:00:23.503,000 --> 0:00:25,000
There's a slum, Old Fadama,

5
0:00:26.341,000 --> 0:00:29,000
built on land reclaimed from the Korle Lagoon,

6
0:00:30.14,000 --> 0:00:32,000
just before it opens into the Gulf of Guinea.

7
0:00:33.908,000 --> 0:00:37,000
There's a scrapyard here where people take apart all kinds of things,

8
0:00:38.04,000 --> 0:00:4,000
from mobile phones to computers,

9
0:00:40.394,000 --> 0:00:42,000
automobiles to even entire airplanes.

10
0:00:43.936,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Agbogbloshie's scrapyard is famous

11
0:00:46.499,000 --> 0:00:5,000
because it has become a symbol of the downside of technology:

12
0:00:51.002,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the problem of planned obsolescence.

13
0:00:54.203,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It's seen as a place where devices from around the world end their life,

14
0:00:59.366,000 --> 0:01:01,000
where your data comes to die.

15
0:01:03.754,000 --> 0:01:05,000
These are the images that the media loves to show,

16
0:01:06.548,000 --> 0:01:1,000
of young men and boys burning wires and cables

17
0:01:11.394,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to recover copper and aluminum,

18
0:01:14.139,000 --> 0:01:17,000
using Styrofoam and old tires as fuel,

19
0:01:17.562,000 --> 0:01:2,000
seriously hurting themselves and the environment.

20
0:01:21.993,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It's a super-toxic process,

21
0:01:24.108,000 --> 0:01:27,000
producing pollutants that enter the global ecosystem,

22
0:01:28.009,000 --> 0:01:3,000
build up in fatty tissue

23
0:01:30.149,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and threaten the top of the food chain.

24
0:01:33.95,000 --> 0:01:35,000
But this story is incomplete.

25
0:01:38.943,000 --> 0:01:4,000
There's a lot we can learn from Agbogbloshie,

26
0:01:41.826,000 --> 0:01:45,000
where scrap collected from city- and nationwide is brought.

27
0:01:46.727,000 --> 0:01:47,000
For so many of us,

28
0:01:48.473,000 --> 0:01:5,000
our devices are black boxes.

29
0:01:50.718,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We know what they do,

30
0:01:52.157,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but not how they work or what's inside.

31
0:01:55.792,000 --> 0:01:57,000
In Agbogbloshie, people make it their business

32
0:01:58.301,000 --> 0:02:,000
to know exactly what's inside.

33
0:02:00.382,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Scrap dealers recover copper, aluminum, steel, glass, plastic

34
0:02:05.942,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and printed circuit boards.

35
0:02:07.906,000 --> 0:02:08,000
It's called "urban mining."

36
0:02:09.852,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's now more efficient for us to mine materials from our waste.

37
0:02:16.31,000 --> 0:02:2,000
There is 10 times more gold, silver, platinum, palladium

38
0:02:20.854,000 --> 0:02:22,000
in one ton of our electronics

39
0:02:23.234,000 --> 0:02:26,000
than in one ton of ore mined from beneath the surface of the earth.

40
0:02:29.6,000 --> 0:02:3,000
In Agbogbloshie,

41
0:02:31.195,000 --> 0:02:33,000
weight is a form of currency.

42
0:02:33.918,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Devices are dissected to recover materials, parts and components

43
0:02:38.948,000 --> 0:02:39,000
with incredible attention to detail,

44
0:02:40.788,000 --> 0:02:43,000
down to the aluminum tips of electric plugs.

45
0:02:45.759,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But scrap dealers don't destroy components that are still functional.

46
0:02:49.908,000 --> 0:02:53,000
They supply them to repair workshops like this one in Agbogbloshie

47
0:02:53.95,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and the tens of thousands of technicians across the country

48
0:02:58.467,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that refurbish electrical and electronic equipment,

49
0:03:02.582,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and sell them as used products to consumers that may not be able to buy

50
0:03:06.394,000 --> 0:03:08,000
a new television or a new computer.

51
0:03:10.463,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Make no mistake about it, there are young hackers in Agbogbloshie --

52
0:03:13.701,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and I mean that in the very best sense of that word --

53
0:03:17.315,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that know not only how to take apart computers

54
0:03:20.035,000 --> 0:03:23,000
but how to put them back together, how to give them new life.

55
0:03:23.817,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Agbogbloshie reminds us that making is a cycle.

56
0:03:27.62,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It extends to remaking and unmaking

57
0:03:30.896,000 --> 0:03:33,000
in order to recover the materials that enable us to make something anew.

58
0:03:35.472,000 --> 0:03:36,000
We can learn from Agbogbloshie,

59
0:03:37.424,000 --> 0:03:4,000
where cobblers remake work boots,

60
0:03:41.299,000 --> 0:03:44,000
where women collect plastic from all over the city,

61
0:03:44.663,000 --> 0:03:45,000
sort it by type,

62
0:03:46.185,000 --> 0:03:47,000
shred it, wash it

63
0:03:48.158,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and ultimately sell it back as feedstock to factories

64
0:03:51.272,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to make new clothing,

65
0:03:52.664,000 --> 0:03:53,000
new plastic buckets

66
0:03:54.455,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and chairs.

67
0:03:56.444,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Steel is stockpiled separately,

68
0:03:58.901,000 --> 0:04:01,000
where the carcasses of cars and microwaves and washing machines

69
0:04:02.855,000 --> 0:04:04,000
become iron rods for new construction;

70
0:04:05.173,000 --> 0:04:07,000
where roofing sheets become cookstoves;

71
0:04:07.748,000 --> 0:04:1,000
where shafts from cars become chisels

72
0:04:11.323,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that are used to scrap more objects;

73
0:04:14.854,000 --> 0:04:18,000
where aluminum recovered from the radiators of fridges

74
0:04:19.151,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and air conditioners

75
0:04:21.898,000 --> 0:04:22,000
are melted down

76
0:04:23.258,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and use sand casting to make ornaments for the building industry,

77
0:04:27.336,000 --> 0:04:3,000
for pots which are sold just down the street in the Agbogbloshie market

78
0:04:31.291,000 --> 0:04:37,000
with a full array of locally made ovens, stoves and smokers,

79
0:04:37.651,000 --> 0:04:38,000
which are used every day

80
0:04:39.213,000 --> 0:04:42,000
to make the majority of palm nut soups,

81
0:04:42.643,000 --> 0:04:43,000
of tea and sugar breads,

82
0:04:44.544,000 --> 0:04:45,000
of grilled tilapia in the city.

83
0:04:47.322,000 --> 0:04:51,000
They're made in roadside workshops like this one by welders like Mohammed,

84
0:04:52.173,000 --> 0:04:54,000
who recover materials from the waste stream

85
0:04:54.716,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and use them to make all kinds of things,

86
0:04:56.748,000 --> 0:04:58,000
like dumbbells for working out out of old car parts.

87
0:04:59.732,000 --> 0:05:,000
But here's what's really cool:

88
0:05:01.248,000 --> 0:05:03,000
the welding machines they use look like this,

89
0:05:03.611,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and they're made by specially coiling copper

90
0:05:07.87,000 --> 0:05:13,000
around electrical steel recovered from old transformer scrap.

91
0:05:14.63,000 --> 0:05:17,000
There's an entire industry just next to Agbogbloshie

92
0:05:18.074,000 --> 0:05:22,000
making locally fabricated welding machines that power local fabrication.

93
0:05:23.549,000 --> 0:05:26,000
What's really cool as well is that there's a transfer of skills and knowledge

94
0:05:27.382,000 --> 0:05:28,000
across generations,

95
0:05:28.836,000 --> 0:05:29,000
from masters to apprentices,

96
0:05:30.834,000 --> 0:05:33,000
but it's done through active learning, through heuristic learning,

97
0:05:34.577,000 --> 0:05:35,000
learning by doing and by making.

98
0:05:36.548,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And this stands in sharp contrast

99
0:05:38.789,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to the experience of many students in school,

100
0:05:41.222,000 --> 0:05:42,000
where lecturers lecture,

101
0:05:42.855,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and students write things down and memorize them.

102
0:05:46.099,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It's boring, but the real problem is

103
0:05:48.998,000 --> 0:05:54,000
this somehow preempts their latent or their inherent entrepreneurial power.

104
0:05:55.525,000 --> 0:05:57,000
They know books but not how to make stuff.

105
0:05:58.872,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Four years ago, my cofounder Yasmine Abbas and I asked:

106
0:06:02.99,000 --> 0:06:04,000
What would happen if we could couple

107
0:06:05.373,000 --> 0:06:08,000
the practical know-how of makers in the informal sector

108
0:06:09.033,000 --> 0:06:13,000
with the technical knowledge of students and young professionals

109
0:06:13.803,000 --> 0:06:14,000
in STEAM fields --

110
0:06:15.22,000 --> 0:06:18,000
science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics --

111
0:06:19.041,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to build a STEAM-powered innovation engine

112
0:06:22.43,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to drive what we call "Sankofa Innovation," which I'll explain.

113
0:06:27.656,000 --> 0:06:3,000
We took forays into the scrapyard

114
0:06:31.437,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to look for what could be repurposed,

115
0:06:34.305,000 --> 0:06:36,000
like DVD writers that could become laser etchers,

116
0:06:37.25,000 --> 0:06:4,000
or the power supplies of old servers

117
0:06:40.936,000 --> 0:06:43,000
for a start-up in Kumasi making 3D printers out of e-waste.

118
0:06:45.453,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The key was to bring together young people from different backgrounds

119
0:06:49.211,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that ordinarily never have anything to do with each other,

120
0:06:52.742,000 --> 0:06:55,000
to have a conversation about how they could collaborate

121
0:06:56.486,000 --> 0:07:,000
and to test and develop new machines and tools

122
0:07:00.619,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that could allow them to shred and strip copper instead of burning it,

123
0:07:04.554,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to mold plastic bricks and tiles,

124
0:07:07.732,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to build new computers out of components recovered from dead electronics,

125
0:07:13.31,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to build a drone.

126
0:07:16.142,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And here you can see it flying for the first time in Agbogbloshie.

127
0:07:22.46,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Applause)

128
0:07:27.129,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Yasmine and I have collaborated with over 1,500 young people,

129
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
750 from STEAM fields,

130
0:07:34.705,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and over 750 grassroots makers and scrap dealers

131
0:07:39.282,000 --> 0:07:41,000
from Agbogbloshie and beyond.

132
0:07:41.351,000 --> 0:07:45,000
They've joined hands together to develop a platform

133
0:07:46.665,000 --> 0:07:48,000
which they call Spacecraft,

134
0:07:49.645,000 --> 0:07:52,000
a hybrid physical and digital space for crafting,

135
0:07:53.286,000 --> 0:07:55,000
more of a process than a product,

136
0:07:56.251,000 --> 0:07:59,000
an open architecture for making,

137
0:08:00.159,000 --> 0:08:01,000
which involves three parts:

138
0:08:01.864,000 --> 0:08:04,000
a makerspace kiosk, which is prefab and modular;

139
0:08:04.892,000 --> 0:08:08,000
tool kits which can be customized based on what makers want to make;

140
0:08:09.118,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and a trading app.

141
0:08:10.674,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We built the app specifically with the needs of the scrap dealers

142
0:08:14.39,000 --> 0:08:15,000
in mind first,

143
0:08:15.835,000 --> 0:08:19,000
because we realized that it was not enough to arm them with information

144
0:08:20.333,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and upgraded technology

145
0:08:21.971,000 --> 0:08:24,000
if we wanted them to green their recycling processes;

146
0:08:25.215,000 --> 0:08:26,000
they needed incentives.

147
0:08:27.151,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Scrap dealers are always looking for new scrap and new buyers

148
0:08:30.818,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and what interests them is finding buyers who will pay more

149
0:08:35.023,000 --> 0:08:37,000
for clean copper than for burnt.

150
0:08:38.213,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We realized that in the entire ecosystem,

151
0:08:40.987,000 --> 0:08:42,000
everyone was searching for something.

152
0:08:43.48,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Makers are searching for materials, parts, components, tools, blueprints

153
0:08:49.548,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to make what it is they want to make.

154
0:08:51.962,000 --> 0:08:54,000
They're also finding a way to let customers and clientele

155
0:08:55.621,000 --> 0:08:57,000
find out that they can repair a blender

156
0:08:57.836,000 --> 0:08:58,000
or fix an iron

157
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
or, as we learned yesterday, to make a french fry machine.

158
0:09:03.496,000 --> 0:09:06,000
On the flip side, you find that there are end users

159
0:09:06.806,000 --> 0:09:09,000
that are desperately looking for someone that can make them a french fry machine,

160
0:09:10.748,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and you have scrap dealers who are looking how they can collect this scrap,

161
0:09:14.485,000 --> 0:09:17,000
process it, and turn it back into an input for new making.

162
0:09:18.461,000 --> 0:09:21,000
We tried to untangle that knot of not knowing

163
0:09:21.527,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to allow people to find what they need to make what they want to make.

164
0:09:24.982,000 --> 0:09:27,000
We prototyped the makerspace kiosk in Agbogbloshie,

165
0:09:28.668,000 --> 0:09:3,000
conceived as the opposite of a school:

166
0:09:31.49,000 --> 0:09:34,000
a portal into experiential and experimental making

167
0:09:35.348,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that connects local and global

168
0:09:37.449,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and connects making with remaking and unmaking.

169
0:09:41.831,000 --> 0:09:44,000
We made a rule that everything had to be made from scratch

170
0:09:45.159,000 --> 0:09:47,000
using only materials made in Ghana

171
0:09:47.59,000 --> 0:09:48,000
or sourced from the scrapyard.

172
0:09:50.136,000 --> 0:09:54,000
The structures essentially are simple trusses which bolt together.

173
0:09:54.774,000 --> 0:09:58,000
It takes about two hours to assemble one module with semi-skilled labor,

174
0:09:59.601,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and by developing tooling and jigs and rigs,

175
0:10:02.739,000 --> 0:10:05,000
we were able to actually build these standardized parts

176
0:10:06.306,000 --> 0:10:09,000
within this ecosystem of artisanal welders

177
0:10:09.674,000 --> 0:10:1,000
with the precision of one millimeter --

178
0:10:12.637,000 --> 0:10:15,000
of course, using made-in-Agbogbloshie welding machines,

179
0:10:15.696,000 --> 0:10:16,000
as well as for the tools,

180
0:10:17.163,000 --> 0:10:2,000
which can lock, the toolboxes, and stack to make workbenches,

181
0:10:20.802,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and again, customized based on what you want to make.

182
0:10:23.827,000 --> 0:10:26,000
We've tested the app in Agbogbloshie

183
0:10:26.903,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and are getting ready to open it up to other maker ecosystems.

184
0:10:30.826,000 --> 0:10:33,000
In six months, we'll have finished three years of testing

185
0:10:34.539,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the makerspace kiosk,

186
0:10:36.225,000 --> 0:10:4,000
which I have to admit, we've subjected to some pretty horrific abuse.

187
0:10:40.346,000 --> 0:10:41,000
But it's for a good cause,

188
0:10:42.299,000 --> 0:10:44,000
because based on the results of that testing,

189
0:10:44.568,000 --> 0:10:49,000
we've been able to redesign an upgraded version of this makerspace.

190
0:10:49.907,000 --> 0:10:54,000
If a fab lab is large, expensive, and fixed in place,

191
0:10:55.55,000 --> 0:10:57,000
think of this as the counterpoint:

192
0:10:58.273,000 --> 0:10:59,000
something low-cost,

193
0:11:00.828,000 --> 0:11:03,000
which can be locally manufactured,

194
0:11:04.015,000 --> 0:11:07,000
which can be expanded and kitted out incrementally

195
0:11:07.634,000 --> 0:11:09,000
as makers acquire resources.

196
0:11:09.953,000 --> 0:11:11,000
You can think of it as a toolshed,

197
0:11:12.827,000 --> 0:11:15,000
where makers can come and check out tools

198
0:11:15.976,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and take them via handcart

199
0:11:18.362,000 --> 0:11:21,000
to wherever they want in the city to make what it is they want to make.

200
0:11:21.745,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And moving into the next phase, we're planning to also add

201
0:11:24.716,000 --> 0:11:26,000
ceiling-mounted CNC bots,

202
0:11:27.604,000 --> 0:11:3,000
which allow makers to cocreate together with robots.

203
0:11:31.405,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Ultimately, this is a kit of parts,

204
0:11:33.687,000 --> 0:11:36,000
which can be assembled locally within the informal sector

205
0:11:37.08,000 --> 0:11:38,000
using standardized parts

206
0:11:38.935,000 --> 0:11:41,000
which can be upgraded collectively through an open-source process.

207
0:11:46.8,000 --> 0:11:48,000
In totality, this entire makerspace system

208
0:11:49.191,000 --> 0:11:5,000
tries to do five things:

209
0:11:50.929,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to enable emerging makers to gather the resources they need

210
0:11:56.153,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and the tools to make what they want to make;

211
0:11:58.341,000 --> 0:12:,000
to learn by doing and from others;

212
0:12:01.223,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to produce more and better products;

213
0:12:04.218,000 --> 0:12:06,000
to be able to trade to generate steady income;

214
0:12:06.966,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and ultimately, to amplify not only their reputation as a maker,

215
0:12:10.827,000 --> 0:12:11,000
but their maker potential.

216
0:12:13.266,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Sankofa is one of the most powerful Adinkra symbols of the Akan peoples

217
0:12:17.818,000 --> 0:12:18,000
in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire,

218
0:12:19.19,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and it can be represented as a bird reaching onto its back to collect an egg,

219
0:12:24.526,000 --> 0:12:25,000
a symbol of power.

220
0:12:27.331,000 --> 0:12:3,000
It translates literally from the Twi as "return and get it,"

221
0:12:30.493,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and what this means is that if an individual or a community or a society

222
0:12:35.25,000 --> 0:12:39,000
wants to have a successful future, they have to draw on the past.

223
0:12:40.03,000 --> 0:12:43,000
To acquire and master existing ways of doing,

224
0:12:43.596,000 --> 0:12:45,000
access the knowledge of their ancestors.

225
0:12:45.938,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And this is very relevant

226
0:12:47.177,000 --> 0:12:51,000
if we want to think about an inclusive future for Africa today.

227
0:12:51.587,000 --> 0:12:53,000
We have to start from the ground up,

228
0:12:54.014,000 --> 0:12:58,000
mining what already works for methods and for models,

229
0:12:58.041,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and to think about how might we be able to connect,

230
0:13:02.197,000 --> 0:13:06,000
in a kind of "both-and," not "either-or" paradigm,

231
0:13:06.333,000 --> 0:13:09,000
the innovation capacity of this growing network

232
0:13:09.943,000 --> 0:13:12,000
of tech hubs and incubators across the continent

233
0:13:13.212,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and to rethink beyond national boundaries and political boundaries,

234
0:13:17.827,000 --> 0:13:21,000
to think about how we can network innovation in Africa

235
0:13:22.141,000 --> 0:13:24,000
with the spirit of Sankofa

236
0:13:24.684,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and the existing capacity of makers at the grassroots.

237
0:13:30.033,000 --> 0:13:31,000
If, in the future, someone tells you

238
0:13:31.845,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Agbogbloshie is the largest e-waste dump in the world,

239
0:13:35.409,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I hope you can correct them

240
0:13:37.665,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and explain to them that a dump is a place where you throw things away

241
0:13:42.233,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and leave them forever;

242
0:13:43.625,000 --> 0:13:45,000
a scrapyard is where you take things apart.

243
0:13:45.86,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Waste is something that no longer has any value,

244
0:13:49.101,000 --> 0:13:51,000
whereas scrap is something that you recover

245
0:13:51.759,000 --> 0:13:54,000
specifically to use it to remake something new.

246
0:13:57.523,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Making is a cycle,

247
0:13:59.676,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and African makerspaces are already pioneering and leading

248
0:14:05.969,000 --> 0:14:07,000
circular economy at the grassroots.

249
0:14:09.128,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Let's make more and better together.

250
0:14:11.397,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Thank you.

251
0:14:12.588,000 --> 0:14:15,000
(Applause)

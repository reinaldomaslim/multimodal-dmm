Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union,

2
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object

3
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
through a desolate countryside.

4
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
With it, they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere

5
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
by being the first to conquer outer space.

6
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
The rocket was huge.

7
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And packed in its nose was a silver ball

8
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
with two radios inside.

9
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
On October 4, 1957, they launched their rocket.

10
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time:

11
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
"We are about to create a new planet

12
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that we will call Sputnik.

13
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
In the olden days, explorers

14
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
like Vasco da Gama and Columbus

15
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe.

16
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now we have the good fortune to open up space.

17
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy."

18
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
You're watching snippets from "Sputnik," my fifth documentary feature,

19
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
which is just about completed.

20
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It tells the story of Sputnik,

21
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and the story of what happened to America as a result.

22
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
For days after the launch,

23
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity.

24
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens,

25
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
it inspired awe and pride

26
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that humans had finally launched an object into space.

27
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But just three days later, on a day they called Red Monday,

28
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
the media and the politicians told us,

29
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and we believed, that Sputnik was proof

30
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that our enemy had beaten us

31
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in science and technology,

32
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs,

33
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile.

34
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
All hell broke loose.

35
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America --

36
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9/11.

37
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It provoked the missile gap.

38
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It exploded an arms race.

39
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It began the space race.

40
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Within a year, Congress funded huge weapons increases,

41
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons

42
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to 20,000.

43
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases.

44
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
For example, some here will remember

45
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
this day, June 1958,

46
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
the National Civil Defense Drill,

47
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground.

48
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans

49
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
believed that a nuclear war would happen,

50
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and that at least 50 percent of our population

51
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
was going to be killed.

52
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well.

53
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
For example, some in this room went to school on scholarship

54
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
because of Sputnik.

55
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Support for engineering, math and science --

56
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
education in general -- boomed.

57
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik

58
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
led directly to ARPA, and the Internet,

59
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and, of course, NASA.

60
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
My feature documentary shows how a free society

61
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
can be stampeded by those who know how to use media.

62
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But it also shows how we can turn

63
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
what appears at first to be a bad situation,

64
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
into something that was overall very good for America.

65
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
"Sputnik" will soon be released.

66
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
In closing, I would like to take a moment to thank

67
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
one of my investors:

68
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
longtime TEDster, Jay Walker.

69
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And I'd like to thank you all.

70
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
(Applause).

71
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Thank you, Chris.

2
0:00:12.913,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Growing up in central Wisconsin, I spent a lot of time outside.

3
0:00:16.04,000 --> 0:00:19,000
In the spring, I'd smell the heady fragrance of lilacs.

4
0:00:19.666,000 --> 0:00:21,000
In the summer, I loved the electric glow of fireflies

5
0:00:22.355,000 --> 0:00:24,000
as they would zip around on muggy nights.

6
0:00:24.553,000 --> 0:00:27,000
In the fall, the bogs were brimming with the bright red of cranberries.

7
0:00:28.776,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Even winter had its charms,

8
0:00:30.577,000 --> 0:00:32,000
with the Christmassy bouquet emanating from pine trees.

9
0:00:33.173,000 --> 0:00:36,000
For me, nature has always been a source of wonder and inspiration.

10
0:00:37.292,000 --> 0:00:4,000
As I went on to graduate school in chemistry, and in later years,

11
0:00:40.371,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I came to better understand the natural world in molecular detail.

12
0:00:43.521,000 --> 0:00:44,000
All the things that I just mentioned,

13
0:00:45.315,000 --> 0:00:47,000
from the scents of lilacs and pines

14
0:00:47.538,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to the bright red of cranberries and the glow of fireflies,

15
0:00:50.331,000 --> 0:00:51,000
have at least one thing in common:

16
0:00:52.482,000 --> 0:00:54,000
they're manufactured by enzymes.

17
0:00:55.18,000 --> 0:00:58,000
As I said, I grew up in Wisconsin, so of course, I like cheese

18
0:00:58.354,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and the Green Bay Packers.

19
0:01:00.093,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But let's talk about cheese for a minute.

20
0:01:02.085,000 --> 0:01:03,000
For at least the last 7,000 years,

21
0:01:03.736,000 --> 0:01:05,000
humans have extracted a mixture of enzymes

22
0:01:06.038,000 --> 0:01:08,000
from the stomachs of cows and sheep and goats

23
0:01:08.784,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and added it to milk.

24
0:01:10.022,000 --> 0:01:13,000
This causes the milk to curdle -- it's part of the cheese-making process.

25
0:01:13.475,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The key enzyme in this mixture is called chymosin.

26
0:01:15.879,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I want to show you how that works.

27
0:01:17.728,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Right here, I've got two tubes,

28
0:01:19.65,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and I'm going to add chymosin to one of these.

29
0:01:21.88,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Just a second here.

30
0:01:23.744,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Now my son Anthony, who is eight years old,

31
0:01:27.23,000 --> 0:01:3,000
was very interested in helping me figure out a demo for the TED Talk,

32
0:01:30.532,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and so we were in the kitchen, we were slicing up pineapples,

33
0:01:34.676,000 --> 0:01:37,000
extracting enzymes from red potatoes

34
0:01:38.634,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and doing all kinds of demos in the kitchen.

35
0:01:40.737,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And in the end, though,

36
0:01:41.92,000 --> 0:01:43,000
we thought the chymosin demo was pretty cool.

37
0:01:44.11,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And so what's happening here

38
0:01:45.53,000 --> 0:01:48,000
is the chymosin is swimming around in the milk,

39
0:01:49.553,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and it's binding to a protein there called casein.

40
0:01:52.696,000 --> 0:01:54,000
What it does then is it clips the casein --

41
0:01:54.998,000 --> 0:01:55,000
it's like a molecular scissors.

42
0:01:57.102,000 --> 0:02:01,000
It's that clipping action that causes the milk to curdle.

43
0:02:01.165,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So here we are in the kitchen, working on this.

44
0:02:04.332,000 --> 0:02:05,000
OK.

45
0:02:05.53,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So let me give this a quick zip.

46
0:02:08.18,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And then we'll set these to the side and let these simmer for a minute.

47
0:02:11.681,000 --> 0:02:12,000
OK.

48
0:02:15.506,000 --> 0:02:16,000
If DNA is the blueprint of life,

49
0:02:17.109,000 --> 0:02:19,000
enzymes are the laborers that carry out its instructions.

50
0:02:20.009,000 --> 0:02:22,000
An enzyme is a protein that's a catalyst,

51
0:02:22.079,000 --> 0:02:24,000
it speeds up or accelerates a chemical reaction,

52
0:02:24.922,000 --> 0:02:27,000
just as the chymosin over here is accelerating the curdling of the milk.

53
0:02:28.914,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But it's not just about cheese.

54
0:02:30.693,000 --> 0:02:33,000
While enzymes do play an important role in the foods that we eat,

55
0:02:34.034,000 --> 0:02:37,000
they also are involved in everything from the health of an infant

56
0:02:37.502,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to attacking the biggest environmental challenges

57
0:02:39.836,000 --> 0:02:4,000
we have today.

58
0:02:41.72,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The basic building blocks of enzymes are called amino acids.

59
0:02:45.482,000 --> 0:02:46,000
There are 20 common amino acids,

60
0:02:47.078,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and we typically designate them with single-letter abbreviations,

61
0:02:50.459,000 --> 0:02:52,000
so it's really an alphabet of amino acids.

62
0:02:53.236,000 --> 0:02:55,000
In an enzyme, these amino acids are strung together,

63
0:02:55.8,000 --> 0:02:56,000
like pearls on a necklace.

64
0:02:57.263,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And it's really the identity of the amino acids,

65
0:02:59.839,000 --> 0:03:,000
which letters are in that necklace,

66
0:03:01.549,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and in what order they are, what they spell out,

67
0:03:03.843,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that gives an enzyme its unique properties and differentiates it from other enzymes.

68
0:03:07.95,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Now, this string of amino acids,

69
0:03:10.29,000 --> 0:03:11,000
this necklace,

70
0:03:11.48,000 --> 0:03:12,000
folds up into a higher-order structure.

71
0:03:13.38,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And if you were to zoom in at the molecular level

72
0:03:15.712,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and take a look at chymosin, which is the enzyme working over here,

73
0:03:18.932,000 --> 0:03:19,000
you would see it looks like this.

74
0:03:20.569,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It's all these strands and loops and helices and twists and turns,

75
0:03:23.704,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and it has to be in just this conformation to work properly.

76
0:03:27.038,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Nowadays, we can make enzymes in microbes,

77
0:03:29.792,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and that can be like a bacteria or a yeast, for example.

78
0:03:32.982,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And the way we do this is we get a piece of DNA

79
0:03:35.435,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that codes for an enzyme that we're interested in,

80
0:03:37.824,000 --> 0:03:38,000
we insert that into the microbe,

81
0:03:39.411,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and we let the microbe use its own machinery, its own wherewithal,

82
0:03:42.895,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to produce that enzyme for us.

83
0:03:45.053,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So if you wanted chymosin, you wouldn't need a calf, nowadays --

84
0:03:48.484,000 --> 0:03:49,000
you could get this from a microbe.

85
0:03:50.222,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And what's even cooler, I think,

86
0:03:51.785,000 --> 0:03:53,000
is we can now dial in completely custom DNA sequences

87
0:03:54.301,000 --> 0:03:55,000
to make whatever enzymes we want,

88
0:03:55.912,000 --> 0:03:56,000
stuff that's not out there in nature.

89
0:03:57.756,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And, to me, what's really the fun part

90
0:03:59.632,000 --> 0:04:01,000
is trying to design an enzyme for a new application,

91
0:04:02.307,000 --> 0:04:04,000
arranging the atoms just so.

92
0:04:05.45,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The act of taking an enzyme from nature and playing with those amino acids,

93
0:04:09.594,000 --> 0:04:1,000
tinkering with those letters,

94
0:04:11.03,000 --> 0:04:13,000
putting some letters in, taking some letters out,

95
0:04:13.395,000 --> 0:04:14,000
maybe rearranging them a little bit,

96
0:04:15.164,000 --> 0:04:16,000
is a little bit like finding a book

97
0:04:16.879,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and editing a few chapters or changing the ending.

98
0:04:20.72,000 --> 0:04:21,000
In 2018, the Nobel prize in chemistry

99
0:04:22.72,000 --> 0:04:24,000
was given for the development of this approach,

100
0:04:24.935,000 --> 0:04:26,000
which is known as directed evolution.

101
0:04:27.966,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Nowadays, we can harness the powers of directed evolution

102
0:04:31.823,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to design enzymes for custom purposes,

103
0:04:33.934,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and one of these is designing enzymes for doing applications in new areas,

104
0:04:38.911,000 --> 0:04:39,000
like laundry.

105
0:04:40.093,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So just as enzymes in your body

106
0:04:41.616,000 --> 0:04:43,000
can help you to break down the food that you eat,

107
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
enzymes in your laundry detergent

108
0:04:45.88,000 --> 0:04:48,000
can help you to break down the stains on your clothes.

109
0:04:49.515,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It turns out that about 90 percent of the energy

110
0:04:52.149,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that goes into doing the wash

111
0:04:53.65,000 --> 0:04:54,000
is from water heating.

112
0:04:55.165,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And that's for good reason --

113
0:04:56.615,000 --> 0:04:58,000
the warmer water helps to get your clothes clean.

114
0:04:58.971,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But what if you were able to do the wash in cold water instead?

115
0:05:02.022,000 --> 0:05:03,000
You certainly would save some money,

116
0:05:03.792,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and in addition to that,

117
0:05:04.991,000 --> 0:05:06,000
according to some calculations done by Procter and Gamble,

118
0:05:07.744,000 --> 0:05:1,000
if all households in the US were to do the laundry in cold water,

119
0:05:10.855,000 --> 0:05:15,000
we would save the emissions of 32 metric tons of CO2 each year.

120
0:05:15.894,000 --> 0:05:16,000
That's a lot,

121
0:05:17.101,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that's about the equivalent

122
0:05:18.441,000 --> 0:05:21,000
of the carbon dioxide emitted by 6.3 million cars.

123
0:05:21.64,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So, how would we go about designing an enzyme

124
0:05:24.02,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to realize these changes?

125
0:05:25.362,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Enzymes didn't evolve to clean dirty laundry,

126
0:05:28.147,000 --> 0:05:29,000
much less in cold water.

127
0:05:30.282,000 --> 0:05:33,000
But we can go to nature, and we can find a starting point.

128
0:05:33.371,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We can find an enzyme that has some starting activity,

129
0:05:36.006,000 --> 0:05:37,000
some clay that we can work with.

130
0:05:37.711,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So this is an example of such an enzyme, right here on the screen.

131
0:05:40.831,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And we can start playing with those amino acids, as I said,

132
0:05:43.712,000 --> 0:05:45,000
putting some letters in, taking some letters out,

133
0:05:46.173,000 --> 0:05:47,000
rearranging those.

134
0:05:47.364,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And in doing so, we can generate thousands of enzymes.

135
0:05:50.458,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And we can take those enzymes,

136
0:05:52.99,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and we can test them in little plates like this.

137
0:05:56.339,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So this plate that I'm holding in my hands

138
0:05:59.244,000 --> 0:06:,000
contains 96 wells,

139
0:06:00.879,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and in each well is a piece of fabric with a stain on it.

140
0:06:04.99,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And we can measure how well each of these enzymes

141
0:06:07.355,000 --> 0:06:09,000
are able to remove the stains from the pieces of fabric,

142
0:06:10.038,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and in that way see how well it's working.

143
0:06:12.084,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And we can do this using robotics,

144
0:06:13.831,000 --> 0:06:15,000
like you'll see in just a second on the screen.

145
0:06:19.427,000 --> 0:06:21,000
OK, so we do this, and it turns out

146
0:06:21.768,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that some of the enzymes are sort of in the ballpark

147
0:06:24.244,000 --> 0:06:25,000
of the starting enzyme.

148
0:06:25.458,000 --> 0:06:26,000
That's nothing to write home about.

149
0:06:27.173,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Some are worse, so we get rid of those.

150
0:06:29.585,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And then some are better.

151
0:06:30.934,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Those improved ones become our version 1.0s.

152
0:06:33.593,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Those are the enzymes that we want to carry forward,

153
0:06:36.037,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and we can repeat this cycle again and again.

154
0:06:38.157,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And it's the repetition of this cycle that lets us come up with a new enzyme,

155
0:06:41.96,000 --> 0:06:42,000
something that can do what we want.

156
0:06:43.806,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And after several cycles of this,

157
0:06:45.418,000 --> 0:06:46,000
we did come up with something new.

158
0:06:47.092,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So you can go to the supermarket today, and you can buy a laundry detergent

159
0:06:50.656,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that lets you do the wash in cold water because of enzymes like this here.

160
0:06:54.577,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And I want to show you how this one works too.

161
0:06:57.061,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So I've got two more tubes here,

162
0:06:59.785,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and these are both milk again.

163
0:07:02.518,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And let me show you,

164
0:07:03.693,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I've got one that I'm going to add this enzyme to

165
0:07:06.034,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and one that I'm going to add some water to.

166
0:07:08.367,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And that's the control,

167
0:07:09.543,000 --> 0:07:1,000
so nothing should happen in that tube.

168
0:07:11.395,000 --> 0:07:14,000
You might find it curious that I'm doing this with milk.

169
0:07:14.641,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But the reason that I'm doing this

170
0:07:16.307,000 --> 0:07:18,000
is because milk is just loaded with proteins,

171
0:07:19.22,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and it's very easy to see this enzyme working in a protein solution,

172
0:07:22.963,000 --> 0:07:24,000
because it's a master protein chopper,

173
0:07:25.625,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that's its job.

174
0:07:27.133,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So let me get this in here.

175
0:07:30.323,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And you know, as I said, it's a master protein chopper

176
0:07:34.331,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and what you can do is you can extrapolate what it's doing in this milk

177
0:07:38.267,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to what it would be doing in your laundry.

178
0:07:40.307,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So this is kind of a way to visualize what would be happening.

179
0:07:43.31,000 --> 0:07:44,000
OK, so those both went in.

180
0:07:46.081,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And I'm going to give this a quick zip as well.

181
0:07:55.017,000 --> 0:07:58,000
OK, so we'll let these sit over here with the chymosin sample,

182
0:07:58.811,000 --> 0:08:,000
so I'm going to come back to those toward the end.

183
0:08:03.152,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Well, what's on the horizon for enzyme design?

184
0:08:06.109,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Certainly, it will get it faster --

185
0:08:07.813,000 --> 0:08:09,000
there are now approaches for evolving enzymes

186
0:08:09.948,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that allow researchers to go through far more samples

187
0:08:12.464,000 --> 0:08:13,000
than I just showed you.

188
0:08:14.108,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And in addition to tinkering with natural enzymes,

189
0:08:16.518,000 --> 0:08:17,000
like we've been talking about,

190
0:08:17.974,000 --> 0:08:19,000
some scientists are now trying to design enzymes from scratch,

191
0:08:20.942,000 --> 0:08:23,000
using machine learning, an approach from artificial intelligence,

192
0:08:24.706,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to inform their enzyme designs.

193
0:08:26.688,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Still others are adding unnatural amino acids to the mix.

194
0:08:30.815,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We talked about the 20 natural amino acids,

195
0:08:33.054,000 --> 0:08:34,000
the common amino acids, before --

196
0:08:34.661,000 --> 0:08:35,000
they're adding unnatural amino acids

197
0:08:36.44,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to make enzymes with properties unlike those that could be found in nature.

198
0:08:40.074,000 --> 0:08:41,000
That's a pretty neat area.

199
0:08:42.211,000 --> 0:08:46,000
How will designed enzymes affect you in years to come?

200
0:08:46.872,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Well, I want to focus on two areas:

201
0:08:48.896,000 --> 0:08:5,000
human health and the environment.

202
0:08:52.142,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Some pharmaceutical companies

203
0:08:53.587,000 --> 0:08:56,000
now have teams that are dedicated to designing enzymes

204
0:08:56.957,000 --> 0:08:59,000
to make drugs more efficiently and with fewer toxic catalysts.

205
0:09:00.849,000 --> 0:09:01,000
For example, Januvia,

206
0:09:02.469,000 --> 0:09:04,000
which is a medication to treat type 2 diabetes,

207
0:09:04.731,000 --> 0:09:05,000
is made partially with enzymes.

208
0:09:06.286,000 --> 0:09:09,000
The number of drugs made with enzymes is sure to grow in the future.

209
0:09:10.536,000 --> 0:09:11,000
In another area,

210
0:09:11.718,000 --> 0:09:12,000
there are certain disorders

211
0:09:13.028,000 --> 0:09:16,000
in which a single enzyme in a person's body doesn't work properly.

212
0:09:16.171,000 --> 0:09:18,000
An example of this is called phenylketonuria,

213
0:09:18.417,000 --> 0:09:19,000
or PKU for short.

214
0:09:20.18,000 --> 0:09:24,000
People with PKU are unable to properly metabolize or digest phenylalanine,

215
0:09:24.327,000 --> 0:09:27,000
which is one of the 20 common amino acids that we've been talking about.

216
0:09:27.985,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The consequence of ingesting phenylalanine for people with PKU

217
0:09:31.826,000 --> 0:09:35,000
is that they are subject to permanent intellectual disabilities,

218
0:09:36.381,000 --> 0:09:37,000
so it's a scary thing to have.

219
0:09:38.252,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Now, those of you with kids --

220
0:09:40.07,000 --> 0:09:42,000
do you guys have kids, here, which ones have kids?

221
0:09:42.641,000 --> 0:09:43,000
A lot of you.

222
0:09:43.823,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So may be familiar with PKUs,

223
0:09:45.633,000 --> 0:09:49,000
because all infants in the US are required to be tested for PKU.

224
0:09:50.577,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I remember when Anthony, my son, had his heel pricked to test for it.

225
0:09:54.639,000 --> 0:09:56,000
The big challenge with this is: What do you eat?

226
0:09:57.243,000 --> 0:10:,000
Phenylalanine is in so many foods, it's incredibly hard to avoid.

227
0:10:00.767,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Now, Anthony has a nut allergy, and I thought that was tough,

228
0:10:03.712,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but PKU's on another level of toughness.

229
0:10:06.196,000 --> 0:10:09,000
However, new enzymes may soon enable PKU patients

230
0:10:09.347,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to eat whatever they want.

231
0:10:11.165,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Recently, the FDA approved an enzyme designed to treat PKU.

232
0:10:15.379,000 --> 0:10:16,000
This is big news for patients,

233
0:10:17.03,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and it's actually very big news

234
0:10:18.546,000 --> 0:10:2,000
for the field of enzyme-replacement therapy more generally,

235
0:10:21.363,000 --> 0:10:24,000
because there are other targets out there where this would be a good approach.

236
0:10:26.726,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So that was a little bit about health.

237
0:10:28.568,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Now I'm going to move to the environment.

238
0:10:31.155,000 --> 0:10:33,000
When I read about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch --

239
0:10:33.869,000 --> 0:10:36,000
by the way, that's, like, this huge island of plastic,

240
0:10:37.141,000 --> 0:10:39,000
somewhere between California and Hawaii --

241
0:10:39.434,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and about microplastics pretty much everywhere,

242
0:10:42.706,000 --> 0:10:43,000
it's upsetting.

243
0:10:43.896,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Plastics aren't going away anytime soon.

244
0:10:45.942,000 --> 0:10:47,000
But enzymes may help us in this area as well.

245
0:10:48.498,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Recently, bacteria producing plastic-degrading enzymes were discovered.

246
0:10:52.387,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Efforts are already underway to design improved versions

247
0:10:55.046,000 --> 0:10:56,000
of these enzymes.

248
0:10:56.585,000 --> 0:10:58,000
At the same time, there are enzymes that have been discovered

249
0:10:59.474,000 --> 0:11:,000
and that are being optimized

250
0:11:00.863,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to make non-petroleum-derived biodegradable plastics.

251
0:11:05.171,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Enzymes may also offer some help in capturing greenhouse gases,

252
0:11:08.869,000 --> 0:11:11,000
such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.

253
0:11:12.536,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Now, there is no doubt, these are major challenges,

254
0:11:14.972,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and none of them are easy.

255
0:11:16.839,000 --> 0:11:2,000
But our ability to harness enzymes may help us to tackle these in the future,

256
0:11:21.014,000 --> 0:11:23,000
so I think that's another area to be looking forward.

257
0:11:23.554,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So now I'm going to get back to the demo --

258
0:11:25.585,000 --> 0:11:26,000
this is the fun part.

259
0:11:26.823,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So we'll start with the chymosin samples.

260
0:11:31.863,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So let me get these over here.

261
0:11:33.617,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And you can see here,

262
0:11:35.046,000 --> 0:11:36,000
this is the one that got the water,

263
0:11:36.975,000 --> 0:11:37,000
so nothing should happen to this milk.

264
0:11:38.839,000 --> 0:11:4,000
This is the one that got the chymosin.

265
0:11:41.014,000 --> 0:11:43,000
So you can see that it totally clarified up here.

266
0:11:43.665,000 --> 0:11:45,000
There's all this curdled stuff, that's cheese,

267
0:11:45.864,000 --> 0:11:47,000
we just made cheese in the last few minutes.

268
0:11:48.171,000 --> 0:11:49,000
So this is that reaction

269
0:11:49.348,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that people have been doing for thousands and thousands of years.

270
0:11:52.688,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I'm thinking about doing this one at our next Kids to Work Day demo

271
0:11:55.875,000 --> 0:11:57,000
but they can be a tough crowd, so we'll see.

272
0:11:57.967,000 --> 0:11:58,000
(Laughter)

273
0:11:59.03,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And then the other one I want to look at is this one.

274
0:12:02.363,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So this is the enzyme for doing your laundry.

275
0:12:06.347,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And you can see that it's different than the one that has the water added.

276
0:12:09.879,000 --> 0:12:1,000
It's kind of clarifying,

277
0:12:11.119,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and that's just what you want for an enzyme in your laundry,

278
0:12:13.958,000 --> 0:12:15,000
because you want to be able to have an enzyme

279
0:12:16.165,000 --> 0:12:18,000
that can be a protein chowhound, just chew them up,

280
0:12:19.141,000 --> 0:12:22,000
because you're going to get different protein stains on your clothes,

281
0:12:22.421,000 --> 0:12:24,000
like chocolate milk or grass stains, for example,

282
0:12:24.758,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and something like this is going to help you get them off.

283
0:12:27.576,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And this is also going to be the thing that allows you

284
0:12:30.189,000 --> 0:12:32,000
to do the wash in cold water, reduce your carbon footprint

285
0:12:32.985,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and save you some money.

286
0:12:36.713,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Well, we've come a long way,

287
0:12:38.332,000 --> 0:12:42,000
considering this 7,000-year journey from enzymes in cheese making

288
0:12:43.102,000 --> 0:12:45,000
to the present day and enzyme design.

289
0:12:45.689,000 --> 0:12:46,000
We're really at a creative crossroads,

290
0:12:47.594,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and with enzymes, can edit what nature wrote

291
0:12:51.88,000 --> 0:12:53,000
or write our own stories with amino acids.

292
0:12:54.88,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So next time you're outdoors on a muggy night

293
0:12:58.065,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and you see a firefly,

294
0:12:59.502,000 --> 0:13:,000
I hope you think of enzymes.

295
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
They're doing amazing things for us today.

296
0:13:03.557,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And by design,

297
0:13:05.184,000 --> 0:13:07,000
they could be doing even more amazing things tomorrow.

298
0:13:07.738,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Thank you.

299
0:13:08.913,000 --> 0:13:1,000
(Applause)

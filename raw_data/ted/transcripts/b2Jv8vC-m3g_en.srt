1
0:00:13.754,000 --> 0:00:17,000
There are 200 million clinical cases

2
0:00:18.444,000 --> 0:00:22,000
of falciparum malaria in Africa every year,

3
0:00:22.871,000 --> 0:00:24,000
resulting in half a million deaths.

4
0:00:26.395,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I would like to talk to you about malaria vaccines.

5
0:00:30.807,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The ones that we have made to date are simply not good enough.

6
0:00:36.998,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Why?

7
0:00:38.474,000 --> 0:00:41,000
We've been working at it for 100 plus years.

8
0:00:42.95,000 --> 0:00:45,000
When we started, technology was limited.

9
0:00:46.966,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We could see just a tiny fraction of what the parasite really looked like.

10
0:00:54.466,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Today, we are awash with technology,

11
0:00:57.855,000 --> 0:01:01,000
advanced imaging and omics platforms --

12
0:01:01.934,000 --> 0:01:05,000
genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics.

13
0:01:06.62,000 --> 0:01:09,000
These tools have given us a clearer view

14
0:01:10.517,000 --> 0:01:14,000
of just how complex the parasite really is.

15
0:01:15.365,000 --> 0:01:17,000
However, in spite of this,

16
0:01:18.016,000 --> 0:01:23,000
our approach to vaccine design has remained pretty rudimentary.

17
0:01:24.04,000 --> 0:01:28,000
To make a good vaccine, we must go back to basics

18
0:01:28.484,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to understand how our bodies handle this complexity.

19
0:01:34.46,000 --> 0:01:38,000
People who are frequently infected with malaria

20
0:01:38.681,000 --> 0:01:39,000
learn to deal with it.

21
0:01:40.689,000 --> 0:01:43,000
They get the infection, but they don't get ill.

22
0:01:44.688,000 --> 0:01:47,000
The recipe is encoded in antibodies.

23
0:01:48.903,000 --> 0:01:51,000
My team went back to our complex parasite,

24
0:01:52.911,000 --> 0:01:56,000
probed it with samples from Africans who had overcome malaria

25
0:01:57.863,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to answer the question:

26
0:01:59.712,000 --> 0:02:03,000
"What does a successful antibody response look like?"

27
0:02:04.212,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We found over 200 proteins,

28
0:02:07.538,000 --> 0:02:11,000
many of which are not on the radar for malaria vaccines.

29
0:02:12.141,000 --> 0:02:17,000
My research community may be missing out important parts of the parasite.

30
0:02:18.283,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Until recently, when one had identified a protein of interest,

31
0:02:23.572,000 --> 0:02:26,000
they tested whether it might be important for a vaccine

32
0:02:27.199,000 --> 0:02:29,000
by conducting a cohort study.

33
0:02:30.307,000 --> 0:02:35,000
This typically involved about 300 participants in a village in Africa,

34
0:02:35.903,000 --> 0:02:37,000
whose samples were analyzed to see

35
0:02:38.736,000 --> 0:02:43,000
whether antibodies to the protein would predict who got malaria

36
0:02:44.466,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and who did not.

37
0:02:46.323,000 --> 0:02:48,000
In the past 30 years,

38
0:02:48.45,000 --> 0:02:52,000
these studies have tested a small number of proteins

39
0:02:53.252,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in relatively few samples

40
0:02:55.648,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and usually in single locations.

41
0:02:58.782,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The results have not been consistent.

42
0:03:02.956,000 --> 0:03:08,000
My team essentially collapsed 30 years of this type of research

43
0:03:09.061,000 --> 0:03:13,000
into one exciting experiment, conducted over just three months.

44
0:03:14.609,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Innovatively, we assembled 10,000 samples

45
0:03:18.855,000 --> 0:03:22,000
from 15 locations in seven African countries,

46
0:03:23.292,000 --> 0:03:27,000
spanning time, age and the variable intensity

47
0:03:27.538,000 --> 0:03:29,000
of malaria experienced in Africa.

48
0:03:30.585,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We used omics intelligence to prioritize our parasite proteins,

49
0:03:36.268,000 --> 0:03:38,000
synthesize them in the lab

50
0:03:38.292,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and in short, recreated the malaria parasite on a chip.

51
0:03:43.585,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We did this in Africa, and we're very proud of that.

52
0:03:47.379,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Applause)

53
0:03:53.578,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The chip is a small glass slide,

54
0:03:56.713,000 --> 0:03:58,000
but it gives us incredible power.

55
0:04:00.007,000 --> 0:04:06,000
We simultaneously gathered data on over 100 antibody responses.

56
0:04:06.592,000 --> 0:04:07,000
What are we looking for?

57
0:04:08.679,000 --> 0:04:12,000
The recipe behind a successful antibody response,

58
0:04:13.338,000 --> 0:04:17,000
so that we can predict what might make a good malaria vaccine.

59
0:04:18.68,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We're also trying to figure out

60
0:04:20.577,000 --> 0:04:23,000
exactly what antibodies do to the parasite.

61
0:04:24.482,000 --> 0:04:25,000
How do they kill it?

62
0:04:26.061,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Do they attack from multiple angles? Is there synergy?

63
0:04:29.807,000 --> 0:04:31,000
How much antibody do you need?

64
0:04:32.188,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Our studies suggest that having a bit of one antibody won't be enough.

65
0:04:38.458,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It might take high concentrations of antibodies

66
0:04:41.665,000 --> 0:04:43,000
against multiple parasite proteins.

67
0:04:44.673,000 --> 0:04:49,000
We're also learning that antibodies kill the parasite in multiple ways,

68
0:04:49.712,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and studying any one of these in isolation may not adequately reflect reality.

69
0:04:56.454,000 --> 0:05:,000
Just like we can now see the parasite in greater definition,

70
0:05:00.954,000 --> 0:05:01,000
my team and I are focused

71
0:05:02.97,000 --> 0:05:06,000
on understanding how our bodies overcome this complexity.

72
0:05:08.012,000 --> 0:05:12,000
We believe that this could provide the breakthroughs that we need

73
0:05:12.473,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to make malaria history through vaccination.

74
0:05:16.719,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Thank you.

75
0:05:17.894,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Applause)

76
0:05:19.621,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Cheers)

77
0:05:22.041,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Applause)

78
0:05:27.817,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Shoham Arad: OK, how close are we actually to a malaria vaccine?

79
0:05:32.281,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Faith Osier: We're just at the beginning of a process

80
0:05:35.162,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to try and understand what we need to put in the vaccine

81
0:05:39.17,000 --> 0:05:41,000
before we actually start making it.

82
0:05:41.727,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So, we're not really close to the vaccine, but we're getting there.

83
0:05:45.584,000 --> 0:05:46,000
SA: And we're hopeful.

84
0:05:46.849,000 --> 0:05:47,000
FO: And we're very hopeful.

85
0:05:49.323,000 --> 0:05:52,000
SA: Tell me about SMART, tell me what does it stand for

86
0:05:52.593,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and why is it important to you?

87
0:05:54.657,000 --> 0:06:,000
FO: So SMART stands for South-South Malaria Antigen Research Partnership.

88
0:06:01.477,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The South-South is referring to us in Africa,

89
0:06:05.763,000 --> 0:06:09,000
looking sideways to each other in collaboration,

90
0:06:10.292,000 --> 0:06:14,000
in contrast to always looking to America and looking to Europe,

91
0:06:14.522,000 --> 0:06:17,000
when there is quite some strength within Africa.

92
0:06:17.997,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So in SMART,

93
0:06:19.185,000 --> 0:06:22,000
apart from the goal that we have, to develop a malaria vaccine,

94
0:06:23.149,000 --> 0:06:25,000
we are also training African scientists,

95
0:06:25.618,000 --> 0:06:28,000
because the burden of disease in Africa is high,

96
0:06:28.871,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and you need people who will continue to push the boundaries

97
0:06:32.858,000 --> 0:06:33,000
in science, in Africa.

98
0:06:34.54,000 --> 0:06:36,000
SA: Yes, yes, correct.

99
0:06:36.61,000 --> 0:06:39,000
(Applause)

100
0:06:40.053,000 --> 0:06:41,000
OK, one last question.

101
0:06:41.625,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Tell me, I know you mentioned this a little bit,

102
0:06:44.403,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but how would things actually change if there were a malaria vaccine?

103
0:06:48.732,000 --> 0:06:51,000
FO: We would save half a million lives every year.

104
0:06:53.256,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Two hundred million cases.

105
0:06:55.106,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It's estimated that malaria costs Africa 12 billion US dollars a year.

106
0:07:02.278,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So this is economics.

107
0:07:03.698,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Africa would simply thrive.

108
0:07:06.626,000 --> 0:07:07,000
SA: OK. Thank you, Faith.

109
0:07:08.151,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Thank you so much.

110
0:07:09.373,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Applause)

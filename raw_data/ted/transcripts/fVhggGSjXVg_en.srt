1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Up until now, our communication with machines

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
has always been limited

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to conscious and direct forms.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Whether it's something simple

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
like turning on the lights with a switch,

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
or even as complex as programming robotics,

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
we have always had to give a command to a machine,

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
or even a series of commands,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
in order for it to do something for us.

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Communication between people, on the other hand,

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
is far more complex and a lot more interesting

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
because we take into account

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
so much more than what is explicitly expressed.

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We observe facial expressions, body language,

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and we can intuit feelings and emotions

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
from our dialogue with one another.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
This actually forms a large part

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
of our decision-making process.

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Our vision is to introduce

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
this whole new realm of human interaction

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
into human-computer interaction

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
so that computers can understand

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
not only what you direct it to do,

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
but it can also respond

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to your facial expressions

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and emotional experiences.

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And what better way to do this

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
than by interpreting the signals

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
naturally produced by our brain,

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
our center for control and experience.

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Well, it sounds like a pretty good idea,

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but this task, as Bruno mentioned,

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
isn't an easy one for two main reasons:

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
First, the detection algorithms.

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Our brain is made up of

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
billions of active neurons,

37
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
around 170,000 km

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
of combined axon length.

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
When these neurons interact,

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
the chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse,

41
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
which can be measured.

42
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
The majority of our functional brain

43
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
is distributed over

44
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the outer surface layer of the brain,

45
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
and to increase the area that's available for mental capacity,

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
the brain surface is highly folded.

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Now this cortical folding

48
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
presents a significant challenge

49
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
for interpreting surface electrical impulses.

50
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Each individual's cortex

51
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
is folded differently,

52
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
very much like a fingerprint.

53
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So even though a signal

54
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
may come from the same functional part of the brain,

55
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
by the time the structure has been folded,

56
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
its physical location

57
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
is very different between individuals,

58
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
even identical twins.

59
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
There is no longer any consistency

60
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
in the surface signals.

61
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Our breakthrough was to create an algorithm

62
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that unfolds the cortex,

63
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
so that we can map the signals

64
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
closer to its source,

65
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population.

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The second challenge

67
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
is the actual device for observing brainwaves.

68
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
EEG measurements typically involve

69
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
a hairnet with an array of sensors,

70
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
like the one that you can see here in the photo.

71
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
A technician will put the electrodes

72
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
onto the scalp

73
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
using a conductive gel or paste

74
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and usually after a procedure of preparing the scalp

75
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
by light abrasion.

76
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Now this is quite time consuming

77
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and isn't the most comfortable process.

78
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And on top of that, these systems

79
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
actually cost in the tens of thousands of dollars.

80
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So with that, I'd like to invite onstage

81
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Evan Grant, who is one of last year's speakers,

82
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
who's kindly agreed

83
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to help me to demonstrate

84
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
what we've been able to develop.

85
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Applause)

86
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So the device that you see

87
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
is a 14-channel, high-fidelity

88
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
EEG acquisition system.

89
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It doesn't require any scalp preparation,

90
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
no conductive gel or paste.

91
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It only takes a few minutes to put on

92
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and for the signals to settle.

93
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
It's also wireless,

94
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
so it gives you the freedom to move around.

95
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And compared to the tens of thousands of dollars

96
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
for a traditional EEG system,

97
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
this headset only costs

98
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
a few hundred dollars.

99
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Now on to the detection algorithms.

100
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So facial expressions --

101
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
as I mentioned before in emotional experiences --

102
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
are actually designed to work out of the box

103
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
with some sensitivity adjustments

104
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
available for personalization.

105
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But with the limited time we have available,

106
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I'd like to show you the cognitive suite,

107
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
which is the ability for you

108
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to basically move virtual objects with your mind.

109
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Now, Evan is new to this system,

110
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
so what we have to do first

111
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
is create a new profile for him.

112
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
He's obviously not Joanne -- so we'll "add user."

113
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Evan. Okay.

114
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite

115
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
is to start with training

116
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
a neutral signal.

117
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
With neutral, there's nothing in particular

118
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that Evan needs to do.

119
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
He just hangs out. He's relaxed.

120
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And the idea is to establish a baseline

121
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
or normal state for his brain,

122
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
because every brain is different.

123
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
It takes eight seconds to do this,

124
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and now that that's done,

125
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
we can choose a movement-based action.

126
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So Evan, choose something

127
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that you can visualize clearly in your mind.

128
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Evan Grant: Let's do "pull."

129
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Tan Le: Okay, so let's choose "pull."

130
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So the idea here now

131
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
is that Evan needs to

132
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
imagine the object coming forward

133
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
into the screen,

134
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen

135
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
while he's doing that.

136
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
The first time, nothing will happen,

137
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
because the system has no idea how he thinks about "pull."

138
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But maintain that thought

139
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
for the entire duration of the eight seconds.

140
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So: one, two, three, go.

141
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Okay.

142
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So once we accept this,

143
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
the cube is live.

144
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So let's see if Evan

145
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
can actually try and imagine pulling.

146
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Ah, good job!

147
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Applause)

148
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
That's really amazing.

149
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Applause)

150
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So we have a little bit of time available,

151
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
so I'm going to ask Evan

152
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to do a really difficult task.

153
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And this one is difficult

154
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
because it's all about being able to visualize something

155
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that doesn't exist in our physical world.

156
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
This is "disappear."

157
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So what you want to do -- at least with movement-based actions,

158
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
we do that all the time, so you can visualize it.

159
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
But with "disappear," there's really no analogies --

160
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
so Evan, what you want to do here

161
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
is to imagine the cube slowly fading out, okay.

162
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Same sort of drill. So: one, two, three, go.

163
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Okay. Let's try that.

164
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Oh, my goodness. He's just too good.

165
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Let's try that again.

166
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
EG: Losing concentration.

167
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Laughter)

168
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
TL: But we can see that it actually works,

169
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
even though you can only hold it

170
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
for a little bit of time.

171
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
As I said, it's a very difficult process

172
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
to imagine this.

173
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And the great thing about it is that

174
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
we've only given the software one instance

175
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
of how he thinks about "disappear."

176
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
As there is a machine learning algorithm in this --

177
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Applause)

178
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Thank you.

179
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Good job. Good job.

180
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
(Applause)

181
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Thank you, Evan, you're a wonderful, wonderful

182
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
example of the technology.

183
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So, as you can see, before,

184
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
there is a leveling system built into this software

185
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
so that as Evan, or any user,

186
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
becomes more familiar with the system,

187
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
they can continue to add more and more detections,

188
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
so that the system begins to differentiate

189
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
between different distinct thoughts.

190
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And once you've trained up the detections,

191
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
these thoughts can be assigned or mapped

192
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
to any computing platform,

193
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
application or device.

194
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So I'd like to show you a few examples,

195
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
because there are many possible applications

196
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
for this new interface.

197
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
In games and virtual worlds, for example,

198
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
your facial expressions

199
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
can naturally and intuitively be used

200
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
to control an avatar or virtual character.

201
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Obviously, you can experience the fantasy of magic

202
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and control the world with your mind.

203
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And also, colors, lighting,

204
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
sound and effects

205
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
can dynamically respond to your emotional state

206
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to heighten the experience that you're having, in real time.

207
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And moving on to some applications

208
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
developed by developers and researchers around the world,

209
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
with robots and simple machines, for example --

210
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
in this case, flying a toy helicopter

211
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
simply by thinking "lift" with your mind.

212
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
The technology can also be applied

213
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to real world applications --

214
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
in this example, a smart home.

215
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
You know, from the user interface of the control system

216
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
to opening curtains

217
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
or closing curtains.

218
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And of course, also to the lighting --

219
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
turning them on

220
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
or off.

221
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And finally,

222
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
to real life-changing applications,

223
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
such as being able to control an electric wheelchair.

224
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
In this example,

225
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
facial expressions are mapped to the movement commands.

226
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Man: Now blink right to go right.

227
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Now blink left to turn back left.

228
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Now smile to go straight.

229
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
TL: We really -- Thank you.

230
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
(Applause)

231
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
We are really only scratching the surface of what is possible today,

232
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and with the community's input,

233
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and also with the involvement of developers

234
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and researchers from around the world,

235
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
we hope that you can help us to shape

236
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
where the technology goes from here. Thank you so much.

2
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So when you look out at the stars at night,

3
0:00:15.76,000 --> 0:00:16,000
it's amazing what you can see.

4
0:00:17.24,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It's beautiful.

5
0:00:18.72,000 --> 0:00:21,000
But what's more amazing is what you can't see,

6
0:00:21.84,000 --> 0:00:22,000
because what we know now

7
0:00:23.24,000 --> 0:00:26,000
is that around every star or almost every star,

8
0:00:26.64,000 --> 0:00:27,000
there's a planet,

9
0:00:27.92,000 --> 0:00:28,000
or probably a few.

10
0:00:30.12,000 --> 0:00:32,000
So what this picture isn't showing you

11
0:00:32.24,000 --> 0:00:34,000
are all the planets that we know about

12
0:00:34.4,000 --> 0:00:35,000
out there in space.

13
0:00:36.28,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But when we think about planets, we tend to think of faraway things

14
0:00:39.52,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that are very different from our own.

15
0:00:41.4,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But here we are on a planet,

16
0:00:43.84,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and there are so many things that are amazing about Earth

17
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that we're searching far and wide to find things that are like that.

18
0:00:51.36,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And when we're searching, we're finding amazing things.

19
0:00:54.88,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But I want to tell you about an amazing thing here on Earth.

20
0:00:59.12,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And that is that every minute,

21
0:01:01.88,000 --> 0:01:03,000
400 pounds of hydrogen

22
0:01:04.32,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and almost seven pounds of helium

23
0:01:06.96,000 --> 0:01:08,000
escape from Earth into space.

24
0:01:10.8,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And this is gas that is going off and never coming back.

25
0:01:15.44,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So hydrogen, helium and many other things

26
0:01:18.48,000 --> 0:01:2,000
make up what's known as the Earth's atmosphere.

27
0:01:21.36,000 --> 0:01:24,000
The atmosphere is just these gases that form a thin blue line

28
0:01:25.2,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that's seen here from the International Space Station,

29
0:01:28.44,000 --> 0:01:3,000
a photograph that some astronauts took.

30
0:01:31.2,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And this tenuous veneer around our planet

31
0:01:34.6,000 --> 0:01:36,000
is what allows life to flourish.

32
0:01:36.96,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It protects our planet from too many impacts,

33
0:01:39.84,000 --> 0:01:41,000
from meteorites and the like.

34
0:01:41.88,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And it's such an amazing phenomenon

35
0:01:45.68,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that the fact that it's disappearing

36
0:01:48.52,000 --> 0:01:5,000
should frighten you, at least a little bit.

37
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So this process is something that I study

38
0:01:55.48,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and it's called atmospheric escape.

39
0:01:58.68,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So atmospheric escape is not specific to planet Earth.

40
0:02:03.28,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It's part of what it means to be a planet, if you ask me,

41
0:02:07.04,000 --> 0:02:11,000
because planets, not just here on Earth but throughout the universe,

42
0:02:11.4,000 --> 0:02:13,000
can undergo atmospheric escape.

43
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And the way it happens actually tells us about planets themselves.

44
0:02:19.92,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Because when you think about the solar system,

45
0:02:22.6,000 --> 0:02:24,000
you might think about this picture here.

46
0:02:25.8,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And you would say, well, there are eight planets, maybe nine.

47
0:02:29.24,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So for those of you who are stressed by this picture,

48
0:02:31.76,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I will add somebody for you.

49
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:34.4,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Courtesy of New Horizons, we're including Pluto.

51
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And the thing here is,

52
0:02:39.4,000 --> 0:02:41,000
for the purposes of this talk and atmospheric escape,

53
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Pluto is a planet in my mind,

54
0:02:44.2,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in the same way that planets around other stars that we can't see

55
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
are also planets.

56
0:02:49.96,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So fundamental characteristics of planets

57
0:02:52.68,000 --> 0:02:55,000
include the fact that they are bodies

58
0:02:55.72,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that are bound together by gravity.

59
0:02:57.56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So it's a lot of material just stuck together

60
0:03:00.08,000 --> 0:03:01,000
with this attractive force.

61
0:03:02.24,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And these bodies are so big and have so much gravity.

62
0:03:05.12,000 --> 0:03:06,000
That's why they're round.

63
0:03:06.44,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So when you look at all of these,

64
0:03:08.08,000 --> 0:03:09,000
including Pluto,

65
0:03:09.32,000 --> 0:03:1,000
they're round.

66
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So you can see that gravity is really at play here.

67
0:03:13.76,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But another fundamental characteristic about planets

68
0:03:17.08,000 --> 0:03:18,000
is what you don't see here,

69
0:03:18.84,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and that's the star, the Sun,

70
0:03:21.44,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that all of the planets in the solar system are orbiting around.

71
0:03:25.2,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And that's fundamentally driving atmospheric escape.

72
0:03:29.76,000 --> 0:03:34,000
The reason that fundamentally stars drive atmospheric escape from planets

73
0:03:35.12,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is because stars offer planets particles and light and heat

74
0:03:40.52,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that can cause the atmospheres to go away.

75
0:03:43.64,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So if you think of a hot-air balloon,

76
0:03:45.48,000 --> 0:03:49,000
or you look at this picture of lanterns in Thailand at a festival,

77
0:03:49.64,000 --> 0:03:52,000
you can see that hot air can propel gasses upward.

78
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And if you have enough energy and heating,

79
0:03:55.44,000 --> 0:03:56,000
which our Sun does,

80
0:03:56.8,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that gas, which is so light and only bound by gravity,

81
0:04:00.72,000 --> 0:04:01,000
it can escape into space.

82
0:04:03.6,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And so this is what's actually causing atmospheric escape

83
0:04:07.56,000 --> 0:04:09,000
here on Earth and also on other planets --

84
0:04:10.28,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that interplay between heating from the star

85
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and overcoming the force of gravity on the planet.

86
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So I've told you that it happens

87
0:04:18.76,000 --> 0:04:21,000
at the rate of 400 pounds a minute for hydrogen

88
0:04:22.12,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and almost seven pounds for helium.

89
0:04:25.04,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But what does that look like?

90
0:04:26.72,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Well, even in the '80s,

91
0:04:28.56,000 --> 0:04:29,000
we took pictures of the Earth

92
0:04:30.32,000 --> 0:04:31,000
in the ultraviolet

93
0:04:31.8,000 --> 0:04:33,000
using NASA's Dynamic Explorer spacecraft.

94
0:04:34.72,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So these two images of the Earth

95
0:04:36.56,000 --> 0:04:39,000
show you what that glow of escaping hydrogen looks like,

96
0:04:40.32,000 --> 0:04:41,000
shown in red.

97
0:04:41.6,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And you can also see other features like oxygen and nitrogen

98
0:04:45.24,000 --> 0:04:46,000
in that white glimmer

99
0:04:46.72,000 --> 0:04:48,000
in the circle showing you the auroras

100
0:04:49.08,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and also some wisps around the tropics.

101
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So these are pictures that conclusively show us

102
0:04:55.04,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that our atmosphere isn't just tightly bound to us here on Earth

103
0:04:58.76,000 --> 0:05:01,000
but it's actually reaching out far into space,

104
0:05:02.4,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and at an alarming rate, I might add.

105
0:05:05.08,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But the Earth is not alone in undergoing atmospheric escape.

106
0:05:08.92,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Mars, our nearest neighbor, is much smaller than Earth,

107
0:05:12.4,000 --> 0:05:15,000
so it has much less gravity with which to hold on to its atmosphere.

108
0:05:16.2,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And so even though Mars has an atmosphere,

109
0:05:18.44,000 --> 0:05:2,000
we can see it's much thinner than the Earth's.

110
0:05:20.68,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Just look at the surface.

111
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
You see craters indicating that it didn't have an atmosphere

112
0:05:25.64,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that could stop those impacts.

113
0:05:27.52,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Also, we see that it's the "red planet,"

114
0:05:30.32,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and atmospheric escape plays a role

115
0:05:32.88,000 --> 0:05:33,000
in Mars being red.

116
0:05:34.48,000 --> 0:05:37,000
That's because we think Mars used to have a wetter past,

117
0:05:38.08,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and when water had enough energy, it broke up into hydrogen and oxygen,

118
0:05:42.68,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and hydrogen being so light, it escaped into space,

119
0:05:46.44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and the oxygen that was left

120
0:05:48.4,000 --> 0:05:49,000
oxidized or rusted the ground,

121
0:05:50.24,000 --> 0:05:53,000
making that familiar rusty red color that we see.

122
0:05:54.96,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So it's fine to look at pictures of Mars

123
0:05:56.92,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and say that atmospheric escape probably happened,

124
0:05:59.4,000 --> 0:06:03,000
but NASA has a probe that's currently at Mars called the MAVEN satellite,

125
0:06:03.52,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and its actual job is to study atmospheric escape.

126
0:06:07.08,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It's the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution spacecraft.

127
0:06:11.68,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And results from it have already shown pictures very similar

128
0:06:15.36,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to what you've seen here on Earth.

129
0:06:17.28,000 --> 0:06:19,000
We've long known that Mars was losing its atmosphere,

130
0:06:19.8,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but we have some stunning pictures.

131
0:06:21.6,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Here, for example, you can see in the red circle

132
0:06:24.76,000 --> 0:06:25,000
is the size of Mars,

133
0:06:26.28,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and in blue you can see the hydrogen escaping away from the planet.

134
0:06:30.48,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So it's reaching out more than 10 times the size of the planet,

135
0:06:34.04,000 --> 0:06:36,000
far enough away that it's no longer bound to that planet.

136
0:06:36.76,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It's escaping off into space.

137
0:06:38.76,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And this helps us confirm ideas,

138
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:43,000
like why Mars is red, from that lost hydrogen.

139
0:06:44.52,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But hydrogen isn't the only gas that's lost.

140
0:06:47.12,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I mentioned helium on Earth and some oxygen and nitrogen,

141
0:06:50.32,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and from MAVEN we can also look at the oxygen being lost from Mars.

142
0:06:54.12,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And you can see that because oxygen is heavier,

143
0:06:56.6,000 --> 0:06:59,000
it can't get as far as the hydrogen,

144
0:06:59.76,000 --> 0:07:01,000
but it's still escaping away from the planet.

145
0:07:01.96,000 --> 0:07:04,000
You don't see it all confined into that red circle.

146
0:07:05.8,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So the fact that we not only see atmospheric escape on our own planet

147
0:07:09.84,000 --> 0:07:12,000
but we can study it elsewhere and send spacecraft

148
0:07:13.48,000 --> 0:07:16,000
allows us to learn about the past of planets

149
0:07:16.6,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but also about planets in general

150
0:07:18.88,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and Earth's future.

151
0:07:20.68,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So one way we actually can learn about the future

152
0:07:23.36,000 --> 0:07:26,000
is by planets so far away that we can't see.

153
0:07:27.44,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And I should just note though, before I go on to that,

154
0:07:30.52,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I'm not going to show you photos like this of Pluto,

155
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
which might be disappointing,

156
0:07:34.44,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but that's because we don't have them yet.

157
0:07:36.48,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But the New Horizons mission is currently studying atmospheric escape

158
0:07:39.76,000 --> 0:07:4,000
being lost from the planet.

159
0:07:41.12,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So stay tuned and look out for that.

160
0:07:43.56,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But the planets that I did want to talk about

161
0:07:45.72,000 --> 0:07:47,000
are known as transiting exoplanets.

162
0:07:48.04,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So any planet orbiting a star that's not our Sun

163
0:07:51.84,000 --> 0:07:53,000
is called an exoplanet, or extrasolar planet.

164
0:07:54.8,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And these planets that we call transiting

165
0:07:57.28,000 --> 0:07:58,000
have the special feature

166
0:07:58.56,000 --> 0:08:,000
that if you look at that star in the middle,

167
0:08:00.68,000 --> 0:08:02,000
you'll see that actually it's blinking.

168
0:08:03.08,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And the reason that it's blinking

169
0:08:04.96,000 --> 0:08:08,000
is because there are planets that are going past it all the time,

170
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and it's that special orientation

171
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
where the planets are blocking the light from the star

172
0:08:13.96,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that allows us to see that light blinking.

173
0:08:16.96,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And by surveying the stars in the night sky

174
0:08:19.84,000 --> 0:08:2,000
for this blinking motion,

175
0:08:21.28,000 --> 0:08:22,000
we are able to find planets.

176
0:08:22.96,000 --> 0:08:26,000
This is how we've now been able to detect over 5,000 planets

177
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
in our own Milky Way,

178
0:08:28.4,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and we know there are many more out there, like I mentioned.

179
0:08:31.28,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So when we look at the light from these stars,

180
0:08:34.2,000 --> 0:08:37,000
what we see, like I said, is not the planet itself,

181
0:08:37.72,000 --> 0:08:39,000
but you actually see a dimming of the light

182
0:08:39.8,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that we can record in time.

183
0:08:41.48,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So the light drops as the planet decreases in front of the star,

184
0:08:44.919,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and that's that blinking that you saw before.

185
0:08:47.36,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So not only do we detect the planets

186
0:08:49.2,000 --> 0:08:51,000
but we can look at this light in different wavelengths.

187
0:08:52.039,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So I mentioned looking at the Earth and Mars in ultraviolet light.

188
0:08:56.159,000 --> 0:08:59,000
If we look at transiting exoplanets with the Hubble Space Telescope,

189
0:08:59.8,000 --> 0:09:01,000
we find that in the ultraviolet,

190
0:09:01.92,000 --> 0:09:04,000
you see much bigger blinking, much less light from the star,

191
0:09:05.6,000 --> 0:09:06,000
when the planet is passing in front.

192
0:09:07.4,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And we think this is because you have an extended atmosphere of hydrogen

193
0:09:10.84,000 --> 0:09:11,000
all around the planet

194
0:09:12.08,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that's making it look puffier

195
0:09:13.6,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and thus blocking more of the light that you see.

196
0:09:16.88,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So using this technique, we've actually been able to discover

197
0:09:19.8,000 --> 0:09:23,000
a few transiting exoplanets that are undergoing atmospheric escape.

198
0:09:24.08,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And these planets can be called hot Jupiters,

199
0:09:26.92,000 --> 0:09:27,000
for some of the ones we've found.

200
0:09:28.56,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And that's because they're gas planets like Jupiter,

201
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
but they're so close to their star,

202
0:09:32.96,000 --> 0:09:34,000
about a hundred times closer than Jupiter.

203
0:09:35.24,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And because there's all this lightweight gas that's ready to escape,

204
0:09:38.72,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and all this heating from the star,

205
0:09:40.44,000 --> 0:09:43,000
you have completely catastrophic rates of atmospheric escape.

206
0:09:44.28,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So unlike our 400 pounds per minute of hydrogen being lost on Earth,

207
0:09:48.92,000 --> 0:09:49,000
for these planets,

208
0:09:50.2,000 --> 0:09:54,000
you're losing 1.3 billion pounds of hydrogen every minute.

209
0:09:55.32,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So you might think, well, does this make the planet cease to exist?

210
0:09:59.68,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And this is a question that people wondered

211
0:10:01.72,000 --> 0:10:02,000
when they looked at our solar system,

212
0:10:03.56,000 --> 0:10:05,000
because planets closer to the Sun are rocky,

213
0:10:05.92,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and planets further away are bigger and more gaseous.

214
0:10:08.88,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Could you have started with something like Jupiter

215
0:10:11.28,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that was actually close to the Sun,

216
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and get rid of all the gas in it?

217
0:10:14.64,000 --> 0:10:17,000
We now think that if you start with something like a hot Jupiter,

218
0:10:17.72,000 --> 0:10:19,000
you actually can't end up with Mercury or the Earth.

219
0:10:20.56,000 --> 0:10:22,000
But if you started with something smaller,

220
0:10:22.76,000 --> 0:10:24,000
it's possible that enough gas would have gotten away

221
0:10:25.56,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that it would have significantly impacted it

222
0:10:27.72,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and left you with something very different than what you started with.

223
0:10:31.08,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So all of this sounds sort of general,

224
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and we might think about the solar system,

225
0:10:35.56,000 --> 0:10:37,000
but what does this have to do with us here on Earth?

226
0:10:38.36,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Well, in the far future,

227
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
the Sun is going to get brighter.

228
0:10:42.32,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And as that happens,

229
0:10:43.56,000 --> 0:10:46,000
the heating that we find from the Sun is going to become very intense.

230
0:10:47.6,000 --> 0:10:51,000
In the same way that you see gas streaming off from a hot Jupiter,

231
0:10:51.96,000 --> 0:10:53,000
gas is going to stream off from the Earth.

232
0:10:54.32,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And so what we can look forward to,

233
0:10:56.52,000 --> 0:10:58,000
or at least prepare for,

234
0:10:58.6,000 --> 0:10:59,000
is the fact that in the far future,

235
0:11:00.44,000 --> 0:11:02,000
the Earth is going to look more like Mars.

236
0:11:03.24,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Our hydrogen, from water that is broken down,

237
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:08,000
is going to escape into space more rapidly,

238
0:11:08.44,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and we're going to be left with this dry, reddish planet.

239
0:11:12.96,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So don't fear, it's not for a few billion years,

240
0:11:15.48,000 --> 0:11:16,000
so there's some time to prepare.

241
0:11:17.08,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Laughter)

242
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
But I wanted you to be aware of what's going on,

243
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:22,000
not just in the future,

244
0:11:22.28,000 --> 0:11:25,000
but atmospheric escape is happening as we speak.

245
0:11:25.52,000 --> 0:11:28,000
So there's a lot of amazing science that you hear about happening in space

246
0:11:29.04,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and planets that are far away,

247
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and we are studying these planets to learn about these worlds.

248
0:11:34.24,000 --> 0:11:38,000
But as we learn about Mars or exoplanets like hot Jupiters,

249
0:11:38.96,000 --> 0:11:41,000
we find things like atmospheric escape

250
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:45,000
that tell us a lot more about our planet here on Earth.

251
0:11:45.76,000 --> 0:11:49,000
So consider that the next time you think that space is far away.

252
0:11:49.84,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Thank you.

253
0:11:51.08,000 --> 0:11:54,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm a visual artist,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and I'm also one of the co-founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I've been working with plastic bags,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
for the last 20 years.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and sculptures and installations.

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Upon working with the plastic, after about the first eight years,

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
some of my work started to fissure

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and break down into smaller little bits of plastic.

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And I thought, "Great.

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It's ephemeral just like us."

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Upon educating myself a little further about plastics,

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I actually realized this was a bad thing.

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits,

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
because it's always still plastic.

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And what we're finding

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
is that a lot of it is in the marine environment.

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I then, in the last few years,

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre.

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And my initial reaction --

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and I think this is a lot of people's first reaction

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to learning about it --

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
is, "Oh my God!

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
We've got to go out there and clean this thing up."

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So I actually developed a proposal

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
to go out with a cargo ship

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and two decommissioned fishing trawlers,

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
a crane, a chipping machine

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and a cold-molding machine.

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And my intention was to go out to the gyre,

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
raise awareness about this issue

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and begin to pick up the plastic,

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that could potentially be used as building materials

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
in underdeveloped communities.

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I began talking with people

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
who actually had been out to the gyre

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and upon doing so,

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I realized actually that cleaning it up

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
would be a very small drop in the bucket

43
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
relative to how much is being generated

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
every day around the world,

45
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture.

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And the bigger picture is:

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
we need to find a way to turn off the faucet.

48
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
We need to cut the spigot

49
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
of single-use and disposable plastics,

50
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
which are entering the marine environment every day

51
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
on a global scale.

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So in looking at that, I also realized that I was really angry.

53
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I wasn't just concerned about plastic

54
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean --

55
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
of which I have learned there are now

56
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
11 gyres, potentially, of plastic

57
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
in five major oceans in the world.

58
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about --

59
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket.

60
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic.

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
All of my beverages are packaged in plastic,

62
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
even at the health food market.

63
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator,

64
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic

65
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
into us and into our bodies.

66
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
So I came together with a group of other people

67
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
who were all looking at this issue,

68
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition.

69
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We have many initiatives that we're working on,

70
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but some of them are very basic.

71
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
One is: if 80 to 90 percent

72
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
of what we're finding in the ocean --

73
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
of the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean -- is plastic,

74
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
then why don't we call it what it is.

75
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It's plastic pollution.

76
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Recycling -- everybody kind of ends their books

77
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling.

78
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
You put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again.

79
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
What is the reality of that?

80
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
In the United States, less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled.

81
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And if you really look into it,

82
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
particularly when it comes to plastic bottles,

83
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
most of it is only down-cycled,

84
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
or incinerated, or shipped to China.

85
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It is down-cycled and turned into lesser things,

86
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again

87
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
or can be used again --

88
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again.

89
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So this is a big issue for us.

90
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Another thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about

91
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
is we've added a fourth R

92
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
onto the front

93
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
of the "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle," three R's,

94
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and that is refuse.

95
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Whenever possible, refuse single-use and disposable plastics.

96
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Alternatives exist;

97
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
some of them are very old-school.

98
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers

99
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers

100
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to store food in.

101
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And I know that I am doing a service

102
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to myself and my family.

103
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It's very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle

104
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
or a glass bottle,

105
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle

106
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and fill that up with water or filtered water,

107
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
versus purchasing plastic bottled water.

108
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I guess what I want to say to everybody here --

109
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue --

110
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
is that this is a huge problem in the oceans,

111
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but this is a problem that we've created as consumers

112
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and we can solve.

113
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We can solve this by raising awareness of the issue

114
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and teaching people to choose alternatives.

115
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So whenever possible, to choose alternatives

116
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to single-use plastics.

117
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this

118
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
into our oceans

119
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and in doing so,

120
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
save our oceans, save our planet, save ourselves.

121
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Thank you. (Applause)

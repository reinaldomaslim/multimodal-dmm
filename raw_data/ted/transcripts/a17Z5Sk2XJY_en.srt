1
0:00:12.794,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I love fashion.

2
0:00:14.693,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I actually go to bed every night thinking about what I'm going to wear

3
0:00:18.646,000 --> 0:00:19,000
the next day.

4
0:00:20.549,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Clothing transforms me,

5
0:00:23.016,000 --> 0:00:24,000
defines me,

6
0:00:24.602,000 --> 0:00:25,000
gives me confidence.

7
0:00:26.769,000 --> 0:00:28,000
You may not feel the same way about fashion,

8
0:00:29.38,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but I bet you have a favorite T-shirt or a pair of jeans that transforms you --

9
0:00:35.726,000 --> 0:00:36,000
makes you feel good,

10
0:00:37.277,000 --> 0:00:38,000
makes you feel confident,

11
0:00:39.03,000 --> 0:00:4,000
makes you feel like you.

12
0:00:41.48,000 --> 0:00:42,000
When I was younger,

13
0:00:43.226,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I wanted to be Betsey Johnson.

14
0:00:45.463,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I thought we were kindred, crazy-hair spirits together.

15
0:00:49.415,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I did go to fashion design,

16
0:00:51.397,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I worked in the industry for years

17
0:00:53.98,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and loved it.

18
0:00:55.666,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I married,

19
0:00:57.136,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I had three kids.

20
0:00:59.746,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But life can be heartbreakingly ironic.

21
0:01:05.779,000 --> 0:01:09,000
My middle child, Oliver, was born with a rare form of muscular dystrophy,

22
0:01:10.573,000 --> 0:01:11,000
or MD.

23
0:01:12.173,000 --> 0:01:15,000
MD affects his muscle strength,

24
0:01:15.754,000 --> 0:01:16,000
his pulmonary system,

25
0:01:17.281,000 --> 0:01:18,000
distorts his body

26
0:01:18.818,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and makes everyday life more challenging than most.

27
0:01:22.439,000 --> 0:01:23,000
From the time he could walk,

28
0:01:23.924,000 --> 0:01:24,000
which wasn't until about two and a half,

29
0:01:25.91,000 --> 0:01:27,000
he had to wear leg braces for stability.

30
0:01:28.606,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Because he wasn't growing appropriately,

31
0:01:30.917,000 --> 0:01:33,000
he had to wear a feeding tube that was placed on his face.

32
0:01:34.751,000 --> 0:01:36,000
He endured stares, and so did I.

33
0:01:38.691,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But my husband Greg and I told him

34
0:01:41.722,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that no matter what,

35
0:01:43.636,000 --> 0:01:44,000
he was just like everybody else.

36
0:01:46.916,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But everyday tasks for Oliver

37
0:01:49.604,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that we all take for granted

38
0:01:51.7,000 --> 0:01:52,000
were incredibly challenging.

39
0:01:54.803,000 --> 0:01:58,000
That simple act of dressing yourself -- the very thing that I adore --

40
0:02:00.64,000 --> 0:02:01,000
was a nightmare for him.

41
0:02:03.359,000 --> 0:02:05,000
His form of MD does not affect his mind.

42
0:02:07.083,000 --> 0:02:08,000
His brain is an A-plus,

43
0:02:09.083,000 --> 0:02:11,000
which means he's acutely aware of his shortcomings.

44
0:02:12.418,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This became very evident when he started school,

45
0:02:16.369,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and that daily act of dressing yourself was a constant reminder

46
0:02:21.107,000 --> 0:02:23,000
of what he could and could not do.

47
0:02:26.171,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So our solution was for Oliver to wear sweatpants every day:

48
0:02:30.493,000 --> 0:02:31,000
to school,

49
0:02:31.685,000 --> 0:02:32,000
to parties,

50
0:02:32.86,000 --> 0:02:33,000
on vacations --

51
0:02:34.293,000 --> 0:02:35,000
his uniform.

52
0:02:36.331,000 --> 0:02:39,000
For special occasions, he would wear proper pants.

53
0:02:39.994,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But many times, because he couldn't manage the button and zipper,

54
0:02:43.842,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I would have to take him to the men's room,

55
0:02:46.572,000 --> 0:02:48,000
which was incredibly embarrassing for him

56
0:02:49.112,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and the other men that were in there.

57
0:02:51.238,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But them -- I said, "Oh, please. There's nothing I haven't seen before."

58
0:02:54.857,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:56.245,000 --> 0:02:58,000
For years we muddled through.

60
0:02:58.652,000 --> 0:03:,000
But when Oliver was in third grade,

61
0:03:01.267,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I found out he was more like me than I ever imagined.

62
0:03:06.437,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Oliver, too, cared about fashion.

63
0:03:09.49,000 --> 0:03:13,000
He came home from school one day and said very definitively

64
0:03:13.552,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that he was going to wear jeans to school like everybody else gets to wear.

65
0:03:17.4,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Well, I certainly couldn't go to class with him

66
0:03:20.074,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and take him to the boys' room,

67
0:03:21.924,000 --> 0:03:24,000
but there was no way I was telling my eight-year-old

68
0:03:25.784,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that he couldn't wear what he wanted to wear.

69
0:03:28.628,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So that night,

70
0:03:30.035,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I MacGyvered the hell out of his jeans.

71
0:03:33.8,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I remembered when I was pregnant

72
0:03:36.37,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and unwilling to stop wearing my own favorite pants,

73
0:03:39.658,000 --> 0:03:41,000
even though I was busting out of them,

74
0:03:41.702,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that rubber-band trick.

75
0:03:43.346,000 --> 0:03:45,000
You moms remember what I'm talking about?

76
0:03:45.993,000 --> 0:03:46,000
The rubber band through the buttonhole,

77
0:03:47.876,000 --> 0:03:48,000
around the button and back?

78
0:03:49.457,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Instant stretch.

79
0:03:51.358,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So I removed the zipper

80
0:03:53.837,000 --> 0:03:55,000
so he could pull it up and down on his own.

81
0:03:56.225,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I cut up the side seam of the bottom of his pants

82
0:04:00.097,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to accommodate for his leg braces,

83
0:04:02.142,000 --> 0:04:03,000
applied Velcro --

84
0:04:03.687,000 --> 0:04:06,000
hold your ears, everybody: peel and stick, mind you --

85
0:04:07.332,000 --> 0:04:08,000
so that it would close around it.

86
0:04:10.237,000 --> 0:04:13,000
When I showed Oliver my arts and crafts project,

87
0:04:14.101,000 --> 0:04:16,000
he absolutely beamed.

88
0:04:16.939,000 --> 0:04:19,000
He went into school with his head held so high.

89
0:04:20.807,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Those jeans transformed him.

90
0:04:23.392,000 --> 0:04:25,000
He was able to get dressed on his own,

91
0:04:26.134,000 --> 0:04:28,000
he was able to go to the bathroom on his own;

92
0:04:28.578,000 --> 0:04:3,000
those jeans gave him confidence.

93
0:04:31.816,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I didn't realize it at the time,

94
0:04:33.613,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but this was my first foray into the world of adaptive clothing.

95
0:04:38.563,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Adaptive clothing is defined as clothing designed for people with disabilities,

96
0:04:43.985,000 --> 0:04:44,000
the elderly

97
0:04:45.193,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and anyone who struggles with dressing themselves.

98
0:04:49.694,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Adaptive clothing did exist,

99
0:04:52.771,000 --> 0:04:55,000
but it was missing that mainstream fashion component.

100
0:04:56.361,000 --> 0:04:59,000
It was very medicinal and very functional

101
0:04:59.475,000 --> 0:05:,000
but not stylish.

102
0:05:01.816,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And that's a huge problem,

103
0:05:03.806,000 --> 0:05:05,000
because what you wear matters.

104
0:05:06.987,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Clothing can affect your mood,

105
0:05:09.261,000 --> 0:05:1,000
your health

106
0:05:10.436,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and your self-esteem.

107
0:05:12.354,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now, being a fashion lover, I've known this forever,

108
0:05:15.202,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but scientists actually have a name for it.

109
0:05:18.339,000 --> 0:05:2,000
It's called "Enclothed Cognition,"

110
0:05:21.801,000 --> 0:05:23,000
the co-occurrence of two factors:

111
0:05:23.928,000 --> 0:05:25,000
the symbolic meaning of clothing

112
0:05:26.322,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and the physical experience of wearing the clothing,

113
0:05:30.441,000 --> 0:05:34,000
both of which have a direct correlation to how you feel about yourself.

114
0:05:35.476,000 --> 0:05:39,000
There's actually a professor in the UK by the name of Karen J. Pine.

115
0:05:40.07,000 --> 0:05:43,000
She wrote a book called "Mind What You Wear:

116
0:05:43.145,000 --> 0:05:44,000
The Psychology of Fashion."

117
0:05:45.396,000 --> 0:05:46,000
She states in her book

118
0:05:47.944,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that when you put clothes on,

119
0:05:50.353,000 --> 0:05:53,000
you adapt the characteristics of what you're wearing,

120
0:05:53.561,000 --> 0:05:55,000
whether you realize it or not.

121
0:05:56.386,000 --> 0:05:58,000
That's why you feel like a rock star

122
0:06:00.216,000 --> 0:06:03,000
when you put on those perfect-fitting jeans.

123
0:06:03.381,000 --> 0:06:07,000
That's why you feel invincible when you put on that power suit,

124
0:06:07.897,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and that's why you feel beautiful

125
0:06:10.493,000 --> 0:06:11,000
in that little black dress.

126
0:06:12.166,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But that's exactly why Oliver felt so isolated

127
0:06:16.193,000 --> 0:06:18,000
when he couldn't wear what he wanted to wear.

128
0:06:18.439,000 --> 0:06:19,000
He even said to me one time,

129
0:06:19.912,000 --> 0:06:21,000
"Mom, wearing sweatpants every day

130
0:06:22.607,000 --> 0:06:26,000
makes me feel like I'm dressing disabled."

131
0:06:28.109,000 --> 0:06:32,000
There are one billion people on our planet

132
0:06:32.526,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that experience some type of disability.

133
0:06:34.615,000 --> 0:06:35,000
One billion.

134
0:06:37.067,000 --> 0:06:42,000
If 10 percent of that billion experience clothing challenges,

135
0:06:42.602,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that's an enormous amount of people that may not be as confident,

136
0:06:46.893,000 --> 0:06:47,000
as successful

137
0:06:48.627,000 --> 0:06:5,000
or even as happy as they could be.

138
0:06:52.42,000 --> 0:06:56,000
The morning after Oliver left for school wearing those jeans,

139
0:06:56.604,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I realized that I could do something about that.

140
0:07:00.976,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And so I did.

141
0:07:02.746,000 --> 0:07:06,000
In 2013, I founded an organization called Runway of Dreams.

142
0:07:08.565,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The mission was to educate the fashion industry

143
0:07:12.353,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that modifications could be made to mainstream clothing

144
0:07:16.284,000 --> 0:07:19,000
for this community that has never been served.

145
0:07:20.509,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And it began with an entire year of research.

146
0:07:24.721,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I went to schools, I went to facilities, I went to hospitals.

147
0:07:28.341,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I literally chased down people on the street who were in wheelchairs

148
0:07:32.08,000 --> 0:07:33,000
or if they had walkers

149
0:07:33.346,000 --> 0:07:35,000
or even if they had a slight limp.

150
0:07:35.446,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Laughter)

151
0:07:36.667,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I know I must have looked insane,

152
0:07:38.443,000 --> 0:07:41,000
but I knew that if I was really going to make a difference,

153
0:07:41.73,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I had to truly understand the clothing challenges

154
0:07:45.327,000 --> 0:07:47,000
of as many different people as I possibly could.

155
0:07:48.989,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I met a young man who was 18 who has cerebral palsy.

156
0:07:53.73,000 --> 0:07:54,000
He was going to Harvard University.

157
0:07:56.371,000 --> 0:07:58,000
He said to me, "Can you imagine?

158
0:07:58.766,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I got myself into Harvard,

159
0:08:01.256,000 --> 0:08:05,000
but my dream is to be able to wear jeans on campus,

160
0:08:05.549,000 --> 0:08:06,000
like the other freshmen will wear."

161
0:08:07.785,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I met a little girl named Gianna,

162
0:08:10.789,000 --> 0:08:13,000
who was missing her left forearm and her hand.

163
0:08:14.479,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Her mother told me

164
0:08:16.03,000 --> 0:08:19,000
she could not bear to see her daughter's difference magnified

165
0:08:19.713,000 --> 0:08:2,000
by a dangling sleeve,

166
0:08:21.489,000 --> 0:08:24,000
so she had every single long-sleeve shirt professionally tailored.

167
0:08:25.881,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Can you imagine the time and money she spent?

168
0:08:29.613,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I also had the great privilege of spending time with Eric LeGrand,

169
0:08:33.845,000 --> 0:08:38,000
former Rutgers football player who was paralyzed during a tackle in 2010.

170
0:08:39.701,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I had, at this point, seen some unfathomable things,

171
0:08:43.749,000 --> 0:08:45,000
but this, by far, was the most heart-stopping.

172
0:08:47.055,000 --> 0:08:49,000
You see, Eric is a really big guy,

173
0:08:49.325,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and it took two aides and a lifting machine

174
0:08:53.677,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to get him dressed.

175
0:08:55.498,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I sat and watched this process for over two hours.

176
0:08:59.214,000 --> 0:09:01,000
When I expressed my shock to Eric,

177
0:09:02.217,000 --> 0:09:03,000
he looked at me and said,

178
0:09:03.474,000 --> 0:09:05,000
"Mindy, this is every single day.

179
0:09:06.433,000 --> 0:09:07,000
What can I say?

180
0:09:07.772,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I like to look sharp."

181
0:09:10.29,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Research done.

182
0:09:12.387,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I knew that if I was going to make a change in the industry,

183
0:09:15.619,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I had to use my background

184
0:09:18.261,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and really figure out how to make these clothes modified.

185
0:09:23.441,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So I took the information I gathered over that past year,

186
0:09:27.762,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and I figured out that there were actually three categories

187
0:09:30.66,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that were affected across the board.

188
0:09:32.841,000 --> 0:09:34,000
The first were closures.

189
0:09:35.2,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Buttons, snaps, zippers, hook-and-eyes were a challenge for almost everybody.

190
0:09:40.276,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So I replaced them with a more manageable technology:

191
0:09:44.11,000 --> 0:09:45,000
magnets.

192
0:09:45.461,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Magnets made our Harvard freshman able to wear jeans on campus,

193
0:09:50.616,000 --> 0:09:51,000
because he could dress himself.

194
0:09:52.811,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Second: adjustability.

195
0:09:55.015,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Pant lengths, sleeve lengths, waistbands

196
0:09:57.987,000 --> 0:09:59,000
were a challenge for so many different-shaped bodies.

197
0:10:00.75,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So I added elastic,

198
0:10:02.827,000 --> 0:10:03,000
an internal hemming system.

199
0:10:05.325,000 --> 0:10:08,000
This way, Gianna could wear a shirt right off the rack

200
0:10:08.608,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and just adjust the one sleeve.

201
0:10:11.123,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Last: alternate ways to get the clothing on and off the body,

202
0:10:14.606,000 --> 0:10:16,000
outside the traditional way of over your head.

203
0:10:17.866,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So I designed a way to go in arms first.

204
0:10:20.958,000 --> 0:10:21,000
This, for somebody like Eric,

205
0:10:22.838,000 --> 0:10:26,000
could actually take five steps off his dressing process

206
0:10:27.047,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and give him back the gift of time.

207
0:10:31.725,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So I went out,

208
0:10:33.568,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I bought clothing right off the rack,

209
0:10:35.787,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I sat at my kitchen table, ripped them apart,

210
0:10:39.566,000 --> 0:10:43,000
did prototype after prototype, until I felt I had great modifications.

211
0:10:45.085,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And then I was ready for the big leagues:

212
0:10:48.417,000 --> 0:10:49,000
the fashion industry.

213
0:10:51.205,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Rather than designing my own collection,

214
0:10:53.729,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I knew if I was really going to make a difference,

215
0:10:56.336,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I had to go mainstream.

216
0:10:59.116,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I believed that I just needed to educate the industry

217
0:11:04.014,000 --> 0:11:06,000
of the enormity of this population

218
0:11:06.766,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and the fact that these were consumers

219
0:11:10.379,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that simply weren't being considered.

220
0:11:13.237,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And I am thrilled to say that the industry heard me.

221
0:11:18.124,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Runway of Dreams collaborated with the most amazing,

222
0:11:23.424,000 --> 0:11:26,000
forward-thinking brand on our planet --

223
0:11:27.442,000 --> 0:11:29,000
(Applause)

224
0:11:36.294,000 --> 0:11:38,000
who took my vision to market

225
0:11:38.887,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and made fashion history

226
0:11:41.496,000 --> 0:11:45,000
by launching the first mainstream adaptive collection.

227
0:11:45.79,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And the rest is yet to come.

228
0:11:49.549,000 --> 0:11:51,000
(Applause)

229
0:11:51.784,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So --

230
0:11:52.985,000 --> 0:11:53,000
(Applause)

231
0:11:55.415,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Fashion holds the key to a vital lifeline.

232
0:11:59.279,000 --> 0:12:,000
Clothing can be transformative.

233
0:12:01.582,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Clothing equals confidence.

234
0:12:06.062,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So tomorrow,

235
0:12:07.736,000 --> 0:12:09,000
when you are starting your day

236
0:12:09.976,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and you're thinking about what you're going to wear,

237
0:12:12.511,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I hope you appreciate the process

238
0:12:15.351,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and think about how what you chose

239
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
makes you feel.

240
0:12:19.994,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Today, Oliver is 13.

241
0:12:22.596,000 --> 0:12:24,000
He wears his adaptive khakis,

242
0:12:24.789,000 --> 0:12:26,000
his magnetic button-front shirt --

243
0:12:27.038,000 --> 0:12:28,000
feels like the coolest kid around.

244
0:12:29.37,000 --> 0:12:31,000
My boy has total swagger.

245
0:12:32.282,000 --> 0:12:33,000
(Laughter)

246
0:12:35.966,000 --> 0:12:36,000
As I mentioned,

247
0:12:39.557,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Oliver's disease is degenerative,

248
0:12:42.974,000 --> 0:12:45,000
which means his muscles are going to break down over time.

249
0:12:47.594,000 --> 0:12:5,000
This, by far, is the most devastating part for me.

250
0:12:52.039,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I have to sit on the sidelines

251
0:12:56.373,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and watch my boy deteriorate.

252
0:12:59.092,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And there's nothing I can do about it.

253
0:13:03.203,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So I am looking up from the things that I cannot control

254
0:13:09.922,000 --> 0:13:1,000
to the things that I can,

255
0:13:11.61,000 --> 0:13:12,000
because I have no option.

256
0:13:14.929,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And so, I am looking up.

257
0:13:17.608,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And I'm asking the fashion industry to look up.

258
0:13:21.291,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And now, I'm asking all of you

259
0:13:24.628,000 --> 0:13:26,000
to look up, too.

260
0:13:27.753,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Thank you.

261
0:13:28.928,000 --> 0:13:31,000
(Applause)

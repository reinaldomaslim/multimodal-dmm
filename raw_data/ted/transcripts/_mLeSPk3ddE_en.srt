1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I want to help you re-perceive what philanthropy is,

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
what it could be,

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and what your relationship to it is.

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And in doing that, I want to offer you a vision,

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
an imagined future, if you will,

6
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
of how, as the poet Seamus Heaney has put it,

7
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
"Once in a lifetime

8
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up,

9
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and hope and history rhyme."

10
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I want to start with these word pairs here.

11
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
We all know which side of these we'd like to be on.

12
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
When philanthropy was reinvented a century ago,

13
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
when the foundation form was actually invented,

14
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
they didn't think of themselves on the wrong side of these either.

15
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
In fact they would never have thought of themselves

16
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
as closed and set in their ways,

17
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
as slow to respond to new challenges,

18
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
as small and risk-averse.

19
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And in fact they weren't. They were reinventing charity in those times,

20
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
what Rockefeller called "the business of benevolence."

21
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But by the end of the 20th century,

22
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
a new generation of critics and reformers

23
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
had come to see philanthropy just this way.

24
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The thing to watch for

25
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
as a global philanthropy industry comes about --

26
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and that's exactly what is happening --

27
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is how the aspiration is to flip

28
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
these old assumptions,

29
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
for philanthropy to become open and big

30
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and fast and connected, in service of the long term.

31
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
This entrepreneurial energy

32
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
is emerging from many quarters.

33
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders, like many of the people here,

34
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
by new tools, like the ones we've seen here,

35
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and by new pressures.

36
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I've been following this change for quite a while now, and participating in it.

37
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
This report is our main public report.

38
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
What it tells is the story of how today

39
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
actually could be as historic

40
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
as 100 years ago.

41
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
What I want to do is share some of the coolest things

42
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that are going on with you.

43
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And as I do that, I'm not going to dwell much

44
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about --

45
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
the Gates or the Soros or the Google.

46
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Instead, what I want to do

47
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
is talk about the philanthropy of all of us:

48
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
the democratization of philanthropy.

49
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
This is a moment in history when the average person

50
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
has more power than at any time.

51
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
What I'm going to do is look at five categories of experiments,

52
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy.

53
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The first is mass collaboration, represented here by Wikipedia.

54
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Now, this may surprise you.

55
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But remember, philanthropy is about giving of time and talent, not just money.

56
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Clay Shirky, that great chronicler of everything networked,

57
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
has captured the assumption that this challenges

58
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
in such a beautiful way.

59
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
He said, "We have lived in this world

60
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
where little things are done for love

61
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and big things for money.

62
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Now we have Wikipedia.

63
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Suddenly big things can be done for love."

64
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Watch, this spring, for Paul Hawken's new book --

65
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Author and entrepreneur many of you may know about.

66
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
The book is called "Blessed Unrest."

67
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And when it comes out, a series of wiki sites

68
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
under the label WISER, are going to launch at the same time.

69
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
WISER stands for World Index

70
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
for Social and Environmental Responsibility.

71
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
WISER sets out to document, link and empower

72
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
what Paul calls the largest movement,

73
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and fastest-growing movement in human history:

74
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
humanity's collective immune response

75
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to today's threats.

76
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Now, all of these big things for love -- experiments --

77
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
aren't going to take off.

78
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But the ones that do

79
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
are going to be the biggest, the most open,

80
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
the fastest, the most connected form of philanthropy in human history.

81
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Second category is online philanthropy marketplaces.

82
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
This is, of course, to philanthropy

83
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
what eBay and Amazon are to commerce.

84
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy.

85
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And this challenges yet another assumption,

86
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy.

87
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Take a look, if you haven't, at DonorsChoose.

88
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Omidyar Network has made a big investment in DonorsChoose.

89
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It's one of the best known of these new marketplaces

90
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
where a donor can go straight into a classroom

91
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and connect with what a teacher says they need.

92
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Take a look at Changing the Present,

93
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
started by a TEDster, next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present.

94
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
GiveIndia is for a whole country.

95
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And it goes on and on.

96
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
The third category is represented by Warren Buffet,

97
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
which I call aggregated giving.

98
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It's not just that Warren Buffet was so amazingly generous

99
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
in that historic act last summer.

100
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's that he challenged another assumption,

101
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that every giver should have his or her own

102
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
fund or foundation.

103
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
There are now, today, so many new funds

104
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that are aggregating giving and investing,

105
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
bringing together people

106
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
around a common goal, to think bigger.

107
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
One of the best known is Acumen Fund, led by Jacqueline Novogratz,

108
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
a TEDster who got a big boost here at TED.

109
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But there are many others: New Profit in Cambridge,

110
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
New School's Venture Fund in Silicon Valley,

111
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Venture Philanthropy Partners in Washington,

112
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Global Fund for Women in San Francisco.

113
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Take a look at these.

114
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
These funds are to philanthropy

115
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
what venture capital, private equity, and eventually mutual funds

116
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
are to investing,

117
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but with a twist --

118
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
because often a community forms around these funds,

119
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
as it has at Acumen and other places.

120
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Now, imagine for a second

121
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
these first three types of experiments:

122
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
mass collaboration, online marketplaces, aggregated giving.

123
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And understand how they help us re-perceive

124
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
what organized philanthropy is.

125
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
It's not about foundations necessarily; it's about the rest of us.

126
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And imagine the mash-up, if you will, of these things, in the future,

127
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
when these things come together in the experiments of the future --

128
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
imagine that somebody puts up, say,

129
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
100 million dollars

130
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
for an inspiring goal --

131
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
there were 21 gifts of 100 million dollars or more in the US last year,

132
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
not out of the question --

133
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but only puts it up if it's matched

134
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
by millions of small gifts from around the globe,

135
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
thereby engaging lots of people,

136
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and building visibility and engaging people

137
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
in the goal that's stated.

138
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I'm going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories,

139
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
which are innovation, competitions and social investing.

140
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
They're betting a visible competition, a prize,

141
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
can attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues,

142
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and thereby speed the solution.

143
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
This tackles yet another assumption,

144
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that the giver and the organization is at the center,

145
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
as opposed to putting the problem at the center.

146
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
You can look to these innovators

147
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to help us especially with things that require

148
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
technological or scientific solution.

149
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
That leaves the final category, social investing,

150
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
which is really, anyway, the biggest of them all,

151
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
represented here by Xigi.net.

152
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And this, of course, tackles the biggest assumption of all,

153
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that business is business,

154
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world.

155
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Xigi is a new community site

156
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that's built by the community,

157
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
linking and mapping this new social capital market.

158
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It lists already 1,000 entities

159
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise.

160
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So we can look to these innovators

161
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to help us remember

162
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital

163
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that seeks a return,

164
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
the good that can be driven could be astonishing.

165
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
Now, what's really interesting here

166
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
is that we're not thinking our way

167
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
into a new way of acting;

168
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
we're acting our way into a new way of thinking.

169
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Philanthropy is reorganizing itself

170
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
before our very eyes.

171
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers

172
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
don't yet fulfill this aspiration,

173
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I think this is the new zeitgeist:

174
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
open, big, fast, connected,

175
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and, let us also hope, long.

176
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things.

177
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
If we don't develop the stamina to stick with things --

178
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
whatever it is you pick, stick with it --

179
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
all of this stuff is just going to be, you know, a fad.

180
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
But I'm really hopeful.

181
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And I'm hopeful because it's not only philanthropy

182
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that's reorganizing itself,

183
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
it's also whole other portions of the social sector,

184
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and of business,

185
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that are busy challenging "business as usual."

186
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
And everywhere I go, including here at TED,

187
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I feel that there is a new moral hunger

188
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
that is growing.

189
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
What we're seeing is people really wrestling

190
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
to describe what is this new thing that's happening.

191
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Words like "philanthrocapitalism,"

192
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and "natural capitalism," and "philanthroentrepreneur,"

193
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and "venture philanthropy."

194
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
We don't have a language for it yet.

195
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Whatever we call it,

196
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
it's new, it's beginning,

197
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and I think it's gong to quite significant.

198
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And that's where my imagined future comes in,

199
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
which I am going to call the social singularity.

200
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Many of you will realize that I'm ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer

201
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Vernor Vinge's notion of a technological singularity,

202
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
where a number of trends accelerate and converge

203
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and come together to create, really, a shockingly new reality.

204
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It may be that the social singularity

205
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
ahead is the one that we fear the most:

206
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
a convergence of catastrophes,

207
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
of environmental degradation,

208
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
of weapons of mass destruction, of pandemics,

209
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
of poverty.

210
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
That's because

211
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
our ability to confront the problems that we face

212
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
has not kept pace with our ability to create them.

213
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And as we've heard here,

214
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
it is no exaggeration to say

215
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands

216
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
as never before.

217
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
The question is, is there a positive social singularity?

218
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Is there a frontier for us

219
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
of how we live together?

220
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Our future doesn't have to be imagined.

221
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
We can create a future where hope and history rhyme.

222
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But we have a problem.

223
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Our experience to date, both individually and collectively,

224
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
hasn't prepared us for what we're going to need to do,

225
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
or who we're going to need to be.

226
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
We are going to need

227
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
a new generation of citizen leaders

228
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning

229
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
as rapidly as possible.

230
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
That's why I have one last thing I want to show you.

231
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
This is a photograph taken about 100 years ago

232
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
of my grandfather and great-grandfather.

233
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
This is a newspaper publisher and a banker.

234
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And they were great community leaders.

235
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And, yes, they were great philanthropists.

236
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I keep this photograph close by to me --

237
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
it's in my office --

238
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
because I've always felt a mystical connection to these two men,

239
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
both of whom I never knew.

240
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And so, in their honor,

241
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I want to offer you this blank slide.

242
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And I want you to imagine

243
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that this a photograph of you.

244
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And I want you to think about the community

245
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that you want to be part of creating.

246
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Whatever that means to you.

247
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And I want you to imagine

248
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that it's 100 years from now,

249
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and your grandchild, or great-grandchild,

250
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
or niece or nephew or god-child,

251
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
is looking at this photograph of you.

252
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
What is the story you most want for them to tell?

253
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Thank you very much.

254
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
(Applause)

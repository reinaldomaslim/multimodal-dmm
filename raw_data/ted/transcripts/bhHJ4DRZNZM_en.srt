1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
For years I've been feeling frustrated,

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
because as a religious historian,

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I've become acutely aware

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
of the centrality of compassion

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in all the major world faiths.

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Every single one of them

7
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
has evolved their own version

8
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
of what's been called the Golden Rule.

9
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Sometimes it comes in a positive version --

10
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
"Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself."

11
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And equally important

12
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
is the negative version --

13
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
"Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you."

14
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Look into your own heart,

15
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
discover what it is that gives you pain

16
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
and then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever,

17
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to inflict that pain on anybody else.

18
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And people have emphasized the importance of compassion,

19
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
not just because it sounds good,

20
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
but because it works.

21
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
People have found that when they have

22
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
implemented the Golden Rule

23
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
as Confucius said, "all day and every day,"

24
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
not just a question of doing your good deed for the day

25
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and then returning to a life of greed

26
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and egotism,

27
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but to do it all day and every day,

28
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
you dethrone yourself from the center of your world,

29
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
put another there, and you transcend yourself.

30
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And it brings you into the presence

31
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
of what's been called God, Nirvana, Rama, Tao.

32
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Something that goes beyond

33
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
what we know in our ego-bound existence.

34
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But you know you'd never know it a lot of the time,

35
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that this was so central to the religious life.

36
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Because with a few wonderful exceptions,

37
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
very often when religious people come together,

38
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
religious leaders come together, they're arguing about abstruse doctrines

39
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
or uttering a council of hatred

40
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort.

41
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Often people don't really want to be compassionate.

42
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I sometimes see

43
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
when I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people

44
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces

45
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
because people often want to be right instead.

46
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And that of course defeats the object of the exercise.

47
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Now why was I so grateful to TED?

48
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Because they took me very gently

49
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
from my book-lined study

50
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and brought me into the 21st century,

51
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
enabling me to speak to a much, much wider audience

52
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
than I could have ever conceived.

53
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Because I feel an urgency about this.

54
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
If we don't manage to implement

55
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
the Golden Rule globally,

56
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
so that we treat all peoples, wherever and whoever they may be,

57
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
as though they were as important as ourselves,

58
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I doubt that we'll have

59
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
a viable world to hand on to the next generation.

60
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The task of our time,

61
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
one of the great tasks of our time,

62
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
is to build a global society, as I said,

63
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
where people can live together in peace.

64
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And the religions that should be making a major contribution

65
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
are instead seen as part of the problem.

66
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule.

67
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
This is the source of all morality,

68
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
this imaginative act of empathy,

69
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
putting yourself in the place of another.

70
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And so we have a choice, it seems to me.

71
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
We can either go on bringing out or emphasizing

72
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith,

73
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
or we can go back to

74
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
the rabbis. Rabbi Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus,

75
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
who, when asked by a pagan

76
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg,

77
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
said, "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor.

78
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary."

79
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that

80
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
any interpretation of scripture

81
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate.

82
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And we need to revive that spirit.

83
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And it's not just going to happen

84
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
because a spirit of love wafts us down.

85
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We have to make this happen,

86
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and we can do it

87
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
with the modern communications

88
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
that TED has introduced.

89
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Already I've been tremendously heartened

90
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
at the response of all our partners.

91
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
In Singapore, we have a group

92
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
going to use the Charter to heal divisions

93
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
recently that have sprung up in Singaporean society,

94
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and some members of the parliament want

95
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to implement it politically.

96
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
In Malaysia, there is going to be an art exhibition

97
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
in which leading artists are going to be

98
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
taking people, young people,

99
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and showing them that compassion also lies

100
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
at the root of all art.

101
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Throughout Europe, the Muslim communities

102
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
are holding events and discussions,

103
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
are discussing the centrality of compassion

104
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
in Islam and in all faiths.

105
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But it can't stop there. It can't stop with the launch.

106
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Religious teaching, this is where we've gone so wrong,

107
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines.

108
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Religious teaching must always lead to action.

109
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And I intend to work on this till my dying day.

110
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And I want to continue with our partners

111
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to do two things --

112
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
educate and stimulate compassionate thinking.

113
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Education because we've so

114
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
dropped out of compassion.

115
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
People often think it simply means

116
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
feeling sorry for somebody.

117
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But of course you don't understand compassion

118
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
if you're just going to think about it.

119
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
You also have to do it.

120
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I want them to get the media involved

121
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
because the media are crucial

122
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views

123
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
we have of other people,

124
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
which are dividing us from one another.

125
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
The same applies to educators.

126
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
I'd like youth to get a sense of

127
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
the dynamism, the dynamic and challenge

128
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
of a compassionate lifestyle.

129
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And also see that it demands acute intelligence,

130
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
not just a gooey feeling.

131
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I'd like to call upon scholars to explore

132
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
the compassionate theme

133
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
in their own and in other people's traditions.

134
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And perhaps above all,

135
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
to encourage a sensitivity about

136
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
uncompassionate speaking,

137
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
so that because people have this Charter,

138
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
whatever their beliefs or lack of them,

139
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
they feel empowered

140
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to challenge uncompassionate speech,

141
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
disdainful remarks

142
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
from their religious leaders, their political leaders,

143
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
from the captains of industry.

144
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Because we can change the world,

145
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
we have the ability.

146
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I would never have thought of putting the Charter online.

147
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I was still stuck in the old world

148
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room

149
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and issuing yet another arcane statement.

150
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And TED introduced me to a whole new way

151
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
of thinking and presenting ideas.

152
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Because that is what is so wonderful about TED.

153
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
In this room, all this expertise,

154
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
if we joined it all together,

155
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
we could change the world.

156
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable.

157
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
But I'd just like to quote, finish at the end

158
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
with a reference to a British author, an Oxford author

159
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
whom I don't quote very often,

160
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
C.S. Lewis.

161
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind

162
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl.

163
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It's in his book "The Four Loves."

164
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
He said that he distinguished between erotic love,

165
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
when two people gaze, spellbound, into each other's eyes.

166
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And then he compared that to friendship,

167
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
when two people stand side by side, as it were, shoulder to shoulder,

168
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
with their eyes fixed on a common goal.

169
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
We don't have to fall in love with each other,

170
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
but we can become friends.

171
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And I am convinced.

172
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I felt it very strongly

173
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
during our little deliberations at Vevey,

174
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that when people of all different persuasions

175
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
come together, working side by side

176
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
for a common goal,

177
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
differences melt away.

178
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And we learn amity.

179
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And we learn to live together and to get to know one another.

180
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Thank you very much.

181
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.995,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Cities are like siblings in a large polygamous family.

2
0:00:18.193,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Each one has a unique personality and is headed in a distinct direction.

3
0:00:23.029,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But they all have somewhat shared origins.

4
0:00:26.497,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Sometimes I think postcolonial cities are like the children

5
0:00:29.568,000 --> 0:00:3,000
of the two least-favorite wives,

6
0:00:31.291,000 --> 0:00:32,000
who are constantly being asked,

7
0:00:32.899,000 --> 0:00:34,000
"Ah, why can't you be more like your sister?"

8
0:00:35.126,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:38.101,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The "why" of cities is largely the same, no matter where they are:

10
0:00:42.312,000 --> 0:00:46,000
an advantageous location that makes trade and administration possible;

11
0:00:46.456,000 --> 0:00:48,000
the potential for scalable opportunities

12
0:00:48.672,000 --> 0:00:5,000
for the skilled and unskilled alike;

13
0:00:51.073,000 --> 0:00:54,000
a popular willingness to be in constant flux

14
0:00:54.116,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and, of course, resilience.

15
0:00:56.587,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The "how" of cities, however, is a whole other story.

16
0:00:59.995,000 --> 0:01:,000
How are they run?

17
0:01:01.722,000 --> 0:01:02,000
How do they grow?

18
0:01:03.539,000 --> 0:01:05,000
How do they decide who belongs and who doesn't?

19
0:01:07.571,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Lagos is my home.

20
0:01:10.36,000 --> 0:01:11,000
You can always find the Nigerians

21
0:01:12.055,000 --> 0:01:14,000
by following the noise and the dancing, right?

22
0:01:14.309,000 --> 0:01:15,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:15.469,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Like any major city, that place is a lot of things,

24
0:01:19.333,000 --> 0:01:21,000
many of which are highly contradictory.

25
0:01:22.37,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Our public transportation doesn't quite work,

26
0:01:24.49,000 --> 0:01:27,000
so we have these privately owned bright yellow buses

27
0:01:27.669,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that regularly cause accidents.

28
0:01:30.555,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Luxury car showrooms line badly maintained and often flooded roads.

29
0:01:35.558,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Street evangelism is only slightly less ubiquitous

30
0:01:38.401,000 --> 0:01:39,000
than street harassment.

31
0:01:40.525,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Sex workers sometimes have two degrees, a bank job

32
0:01:43.771,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and a prominent role in church.

33
0:01:45.603,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:46.631,000 --> 0:01:47,000
On any given day,

35
0:01:47.817,000 --> 0:01:5,000
there can be either a party or a burned body

36
0:01:51.17,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in the middle of a street.

37
0:01:54.544,000 --> 0:01:56,000
There is so much that is possible in Lagos

38
0:01:57.349,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and so much that isn't,

39
0:01:58.563,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and very often the difference between possibility and impossibility

40
0:02:01.8,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is simply who you are,

41
0:02:03.438,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and if you're lucky enough, who you're connected to.

42
0:02:06.672,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Belonging in Lagos is a fluid concept

43
0:02:08.885,000 --> 0:02:12,000
determined by ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender,

44
0:02:13.037,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but most visibly and often most violently,

45
0:02:16.396,000 --> 0:02:17,000
class.

46
0:02:18.312,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Before Nigeria became a country,

47
0:02:20.937,000 --> 0:02:23,000
fisherpeople from the inland creeks started to come down the Lagos lagoon

48
0:02:24.872,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and establish villages along the coast.

49
0:02:27.84,000 --> 0:02:31,000
About 60 years later, my grandfather, Oludotun Adekunle Kukoyi,

50
0:02:32.298,000 --> 0:02:33,000
also arrived in Lagos.

51
0:02:34.487,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Like me, he was an alumnus of the University of Ibadan,

52
0:02:37.927,000 --> 0:02:4,000
a young member of the educated elite in the independence era.

53
0:02:42.082,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Over time, he built an illustrious career as a land surveyor,

54
0:02:45.699,000 --> 0:02:47,000
mapping out now-bustling neighborhoods

55
0:02:47.789,000 --> 0:02:49,000
when they were just waist-high wild grass.

56
0:02:51.173,000 --> 0:02:52,000
He died when I was nine.

57
0:02:52.603,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And by that time, my family, like the families of those fisherpeople,

58
0:02:56.414,000 --> 0:02:57,000
knew Lagos as home.

59
0:02:59.953,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Among the Yoruba, we have a saying,

60
0:03:02.208,000 --> 0:03:04,000

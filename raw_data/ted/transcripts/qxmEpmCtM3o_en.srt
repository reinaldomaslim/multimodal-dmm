1
0:00:12.58,000 --> 0:00:16,000
When I was a kid, I was obsessed with the Guinness Book of World Records,

2
0:00:17.14,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and I really wanted to set a world record myself.

3
0:00:20.62,000 --> 0:00:22,000
But there was just one small problem:

4
0:00:23.34,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I had absolutely no talent.

5
0:00:26.34,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So I decided to set a world record in something

6
0:00:29.78,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that demanded absolutely no skill at all.

7
0:00:33.66,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I decided to set a world record

8
0:00:36.42,000 --> 0:00:37,000
in crawling.

9
0:00:39.5,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:42.5,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Now, the record at the time was 12 and a half miles,

11
0:00:47.66,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and for some reason, this seemed totally manageable.

12
0:00:50.86,000 --> 0:00:52,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:54.46,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I recruited my friend Anne,

14
0:00:55.98,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and together we decided, we didn't even need to train.

15
0:00:59.58,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

16
0:01:02.86,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And on the day of our record attempt,

17
0:01:04.7,000 --> 0:01:07,000
we put furniture pads on the outside of our good luck jeans

18
0:01:08.38,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and we set off,

19
0:01:10.54,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and right away, we were in trouble,

20
0:01:13.62,000 --> 0:01:15,000
because the denim was against our skin

21
0:01:15.74,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and it began to chafe,

22
0:01:17.339,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and soon our knees were being chewed up.

23
0:01:20.74,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Hours in,

24
0:01:22.98,000 --> 0:01:23,000
it began to rain.

25
0:01:25.34,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Then, Anne dropped out.

26
0:01:29.22,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Then, it got dark.

27
0:01:32.5,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Now, by now, my knees were bleeding through my jeans,

28
0:01:35.34,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and I was hallucinating from the cold

29
0:01:37.58,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and the pain and the monotony.

30
0:01:40.3,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And to give you an idea of the suffer-fest that I was undergoing,

31
0:01:44.94,000 --> 0:01:48,000
the first lap around the high school track took 10 minutes.

32
0:01:49.7,000 --> 0:01:51,000
The last lap took almost 30.

33
0:01:53.82,000 --> 0:01:57,000
After 12 hours of crawling,

34
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I stopped,

35
0:01:59.62,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and I had gone eight and a half miles.

36
0:02:03.7,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So I was short of the 12-and-a-half-mile record.

37
0:02:07.38,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now, for many years, I thought this was a story of abject failure,

38
0:02:11.94,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but today I see it differently,

39
0:02:14.46,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because when I was attempting the world record,

40
0:02:17.34,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I was doing three things.

41
0:02:18.86,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I was getting outside my comfort zone,

42
0:02:21.22,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I was calling upon my resilience,

43
0:02:23.5,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and I was finding confidence in myself

44
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and my own decisions.

45
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I didn't know it then,

46
0:02:29.54,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but those are not the attributes of failure.

47
0:02:33.3,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Those are the attributes of bravery.

48
0:02:37.1,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Now, in 1989, at the age of 26,

49
0:02:39.7,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I became a San Francisco firefighter,

50
0:02:42.62,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and I was the 15th woman in a department of 1,500 men.

51
0:02:46.82,000 --> 0:02:49,000
(Applause)

52
0:02:53.06,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And as you can imagine, when I arrived

53
0:02:54.94,000 --> 0:02:56,000
there were many doubts about whether we could do the job.

54
0:02:57.66,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So even though I was a 5'10", 150-pound collegiate rower,

55
0:03:03.02,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and someone who could endure 12 hours of searing knee pain --

56
0:03:07.42,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:09.06,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I knew I still had to prove my strength and fitness.

58
0:03:12.1,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So one day a call came in for a fire,

59
0:03:13.94,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and sure enough, when my engine group pulled up,

60
0:03:16.203,000 --> 0:03:2,000
there was black smoke billowing from a building off an alleyway.

61
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And I was with a big guy named Skip,

62
0:03:22.5,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and he was on the nozzle, and I was right behind,

63
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and it was a typical sort of fire.

64
0:03:27.1,000 --> 0:03:29,000
It was smoky, it was hot,

65
0:03:30.5,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and all of a sudden,

66
0:03:32.22,000 --> 0:03:33,000
there was an explosion,

67
0:03:34.02,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and Skip and I were blown backwards,

68
0:03:36.22,000 --> 0:03:38,000
my mask was knocked sideways,

69
0:03:38.38,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and there was this moment of confusion.

70
0:03:40.66,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And then I picked myself up,

71
0:03:44.1,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I groped for the nozzle,

72
0:03:45.94,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and I did what a firefighter was supposed to do:

73
0:03:48.46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I lunged forward,

74
0:03:50.22,000 --> 0:03:51,000
opened up the water

75
0:03:51.7,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and I tackled the fire myself.

76
0:03:54.54,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The explosion had been caused by a water heater,

77
0:03:56.82,000 --> 0:03:58,000
so nobody was hurt, and ultimately it was not a big deal,

78
0:03:59.54,000 --> 0:04:02,000
but later Skip came up to me and said,

79
0:04:02.82,000 --> 0:04:03,000
"Nice job, Caroline,"

80
0:04:04.58,000 --> 0:04:06,000
in this surprised sort of voice.

81
0:04:06.9,000 --> 0:04:07,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:09.42,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And I was confused, because the fire hadn't been difficult physically,

83
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
so why was he looking at me with something like astonishment?

84
0:04:18.3,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And then it became clear:

85
0:04:19.98,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Skip, who was by the way a really nice guy

86
0:04:23.14,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and an excellent firefighter,

87
0:04:25.38,000 --> 0:04:28,000
not only thought that women could not be strong,

88
0:04:28.779,000 --> 0:04:31,000
he thought that they could not be brave either.

89
0:04:32.58,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And he wasn't the only one.

90
0:04:35.38,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Friends, acquaintances and strangers,

91
0:04:37.66,000 --> 0:04:39,000
men and women throughout my career

92
0:04:39.74,000 --> 0:04:4,000
ask me over and over,

93
0:04:41.22,000 --> 0:04:44,000
"Caroline, all that fire, all that danger,

94
0:04:45.18,000 --> 0:04:46,000
aren't you scared?"

95
0:04:47.14,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Honestly, I never heard a male firefighter asked this.

96
0:04:50.74,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And I became curious.

97
0:04:53.02,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Why wasn't bravery expected of women?

98
0:04:57.58,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Now, the answer began to come

99
0:04:59.38,000 --> 0:05:,000
when a friend of mine lamented to me

100
0:05:01.14,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that her young daughter was a big scaredy-cat,

101
0:05:03.62,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and so I began to notice,

102
0:05:05.58,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and yes, the daughter was anxious,

103
0:05:08.3,000 --> 0:05:1,000
but more than that, the parents were anxious.

104
0:05:11.94,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Most of what they said to her when she was outside began with,

105
0:05:15.22,000 --> 0:05:18,000
"Be careful," "Watch out," or "No."

106
0:05:20.74,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Now, my friends were not bad parents.

107
0:05:23.42,000 --> 0:05:25,000
They were just doing what most parents do,

108
0:05:26.14,000 --> 0:05:3,000
which is cautioning their daughters much more than they caution their sons.

109
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
There was a study involving a playground fire pole, ironically,

110
0:05:36.3,000 --> 0:05:4,000
in which researchers saw that little girls were very likely to be warned

111
0:05:40.42,000 --> 0:05:43,000
by both their moms and dads about the fire pole's risk,

112
0:05:44.14,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and if the little girls still wanted to play on the fire pole,

113
0:05:47.62,000 --> 0:05:49,000
a parent was very likely to assist her.

114
0:05:51.1,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But the little boys?

115
0:05:52.98,000 --> 0:05:54,000
They were encouraged to play on the fire pole

116
0:05:55.78,000 --> 0:05:57,000
despite any trepidations that they might have,

117
0:05:58.74,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and often the parents offered guidance on how to use it on their own.

118
0:06:05.3,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So what message does this send to both boys and girls?

119
0:06:09.74,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Well, that girls are fragile and more in need of help,

120
0:06:13.7,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and that boys can and should master difficult tasks by themselves.

121
0:06:18.34,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It says that girls should be fearful

122
0:06:21.1,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and boys should be gutsy.

123
0:06:24.98,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Now, the irony is that at this young age,

124
0:06:27.5,000 --> 0:06:29,000
girls and boys are actually very alike physically.

125
0:06:30.02,000 --> 0:06:32,000
In fact, girls are often stronger until puberty,

126
0:06:32.7,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and more mature.

127
0:06:34.3,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And yet we adults act

128
0:06:36.3,000 --> 0:06:38,000
as if girls are more fragile

129
0:06:38.66,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and more in need of help,

130
0:06:40.62,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and they can't handle as much.

131
0:06:42.98,000 --> 0:06:44,000
This is the message that we absorb as kids,

132
0:06:45.58,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and this is the message that fully permeates as we grow up.

133
0:06:49.3,000 --> 0:06:51,000
We women believe it, men believe it,

134
0:06:51.78,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and guess what?

135
0:06:53.34,000 --> 0:06:56,000
As we become parents, we pass it on to our children,

136
0:06:56.7,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and so it goes.

137
0:06:58.54,000 --> 0:07:,000
Well, so now I had my answer.

138
0:07:01.06,000 --> 0:07:03,000
This is why women, even firewomen,

139
0:07:03.66,000 --> 0:07:05,000
were expected to be scared.

140
0:07:05.78,000 --> 0:07:08,000
This is why women often are scared.

141
0:07:09.74,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Now, I know some of you won't believe me when I tell you this,

142
0:07:12.9,000 --> 0:07:14,000
but I am not against fear.

143
0:07:16.02,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I know it's an important emotion, and it's there to keep us safe.

144
0:07:19.86,000 --> 0:07:22,000
But the problem is when fear is the primary reaction

145
0:07:23.06,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that we teach and encourage in girls

146
0:07:25.42,000 --> 0:07:27,000
whenever they face something outside their comfort zone.

147
0:07:29.58,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So I was a paraglider pilot for many years --

148
0:07:33.62,000 --> 0:07:34,000
(Applause)

149
0:07:35.54,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and a paraglider is a parachute-like wing,

150
0:07:37.98,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and it does fly very well,

151
0:07:41.74,000 --> 0:07:43,000
but to many people I realize it looks just like a bedsheet

152
0:07:44.66,000 --> 0:07:45,000
with strings attached.

153
0:07:46.18,000 --> 0:07:47,000
(Laughter)

154
0:07:47.38,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And I spent a lot of time on mountaintops

155
0:07:49.86,000 --> 0:07:5,000
inflating this bedsheet,

156
0:07:51.46,000 --> 0:07:52,000
running off and flying.

157
0:07:54.38,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And I know what you're thinking.

158
0:07:55.98,000 --> 0:07:58,000
You're like, Caroline, a little fear would make sense here.

159
0:08:00.62,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And you're right, it does.

160
0:08:02.5,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I assure you, I did feel fear.

161
0:08:05.02,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But on that mountaintop,

162
0:08:06.3,000 --> 0:08:08,000
waiting for the wind to come in just right,

163
0:08:08.38,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I felt so many other things, too:

164
0:08:10.62,000 --> 0:08:12,000
exhilaration, confidence.

165
0:08:13.82,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I knew I was a good pilot.

166
0:08:15.62,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I knew the conditions were good, or I wouldn't be there.

167
0:08:18.66,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I knew how great it was going to be a thousand feet in the air.

168
0:08:22.22,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So yes, fear was there,

169
0:08:24.86,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but I would take a good hard look at it,

170
0:08:27.06,000 --> 0:08:29,000
assess just how relevant it was

171
0:08:29.74,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and then put it where it belonged,

172
0:08:32.1,000 --> 0:08:33,000
which was more often than not

173
0:08:33.54,000 --> 0:08:36,000
behind my exhilaration, my anticipation

174
0:08:37.54,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and my confidence.

175
0:08:39.22,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So I'm not against fear.

176
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I'm just pro-bravery.

177
0:08:46.34,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Now, I'm not saying your girls must be firefighters

178
0:08:49.58,000 --> 0:08:51,000
or that they should be paragliders,

179
0:08:51.82,000 --> 0:08:55,000
but I am saying that we are raising our girls to be timid, even helpless,

180
0:08:57.42,000 --> 0:09:,000
and it begins when we caution them against physical risk.

181
0:09:01.06,000 --> 0:09:03,000
The fear we learn and the experiences we don't

182
0:09:03.7,000 --> 0:09:04,000
stay with us as we become women

183
0:09:05.54,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and morphs into all those things that we face and try to shed:

184
0:09:09.82,000 --> 0:09:11,000
our hesitation in speaking out,

185
0:09:12.14,000 --> 0:09:14,000
our deference so that we can be liked

186
0:09:14.82,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and our lack of confidence in our own decisions.

187
0:09:18.78,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So how do we become brave?

188
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Well, here's the good news.

189
0:09:24.06,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Bravery is learned,

190
0:09:26.06,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and like anything learned,

191
0:09:27.5,000 --> 0:09:28,000
it just needs to be practiced.

192
0:09:29.86,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So first,

193
0:09:31.46,000 --> 0:09:32,000
we have to take a deep breath

194
0:09:33.18,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and encourage our girls

195
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
to skateboard, climb trees

196
0:09:37.98,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and clamber around on that playground fire pole.

197
0:09:41.3,000 --> 0:09:43,000
This is what my own mother did.

198
0:09:43.5,000 --> 0:09:44,000
She didn't know it then,

199
0:09:45.3,000 --> 0:09:47,000
but researchers have a name for this.

200
0:09:47.62,000 --> 0:09:49,000
They call it risky play,

201
0:09:49.74,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and studies show that risky play is really important for kids, all kids,

202
0:09:54.22,000 --> 0:09:56,000
because it teaches hazard assessment,

203
0:09:56.82,000 --> 0:09:58,000
it teaches delayed gratification,

204
0:09:59.02,000 --> 0:10:,000
it teaches resilience,

205
0:10:00.82,000 --> 0:10:01,000
it teaches confidence.

206
0:10:02.9,000 --> 0:10:03,000
In other words,

207
0:10:04.38,000 --> 0:10:07,000
when kids get outside and practice bravery,

208
0:10:07.7,000 --> 0:10:1,000
they learn valuable life lessons.

209
0:10:12.42,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Second, we have to stop cautioning our girls willy-nilly.

210
0:10:17.18,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So notice next time you say,

211
0:10:19.62,000 --> 0:10:2,000
"Watch out, you're going to get hurt,"

212
0:10:21.5,000 --> 0:10:23,000
or, "Don't do that, it's dangerous."

213
0:10:24.3,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And remember that often what you're really telling her

214
0:10:27.9,000 --> 0:10:29,000
is that she shouldn't be pushing herself,

215
0:10:30.34,000 --> 0:10:32,000
that she's really not good enough,

216
0:10:32.54,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that she should be afraid.

217
0:10:36.14,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Third,

218
0:10:37.9,000 --> 0:10:4,000
we women have to start practicing bravery, too.

219
0:10:41.7,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We cannot teach our girls until we teach ourselves.

220
0:10:45.78,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So here's another thing:

221
0:10:47.7,000 --> 0:10:5,000
fear and exhilaration

222
0:10:50.82,000 --> 0:10:51,000
feel very similar --

223
0:10:53.58,000 --> 0:10:55,000
the shaky hands, the heightened heart rate,

224
0:10:56.18,000 --> 0:10:57,000
the nervous tension,

225
0:10:57.58,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and I'm betting that for many of you

226
0:10:59.34,000 --> 0:11:01,000
the last time you thought you were scared out of your wits,

227
0:11:02.18,000 --> 0:11:04,000
you may have been feeling mostly exhilaration,

228
0:11:05.14,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and now you've missed an opportunity.

229
0:11:07.54,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So practice.

230
0:11:09.38,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And while girls should be getting outside to learn to be gutsy,

231
0:11:12.38,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I get that adults don't want to get on hoverboards or climb trees,

232
0:11:18.5,000 --> 0:11:21,000
so we all should be practicing

233
0:11:21.98,000 --> 0:11:23,000
at home, in the office

234
0:11:24.22,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and even right here getting up the guts

235
0:11:26.34,000 --> 0:11:28,000
to talk to someone that you really admire.

236
0:11:30.18,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Finally, when your girl is, let's say,

237
0:11:34.22,000 --> 0:11:36,000
on her bike on the top of the steep hill

238
0:11:36.34,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that she insists she's too scared to go down,

239
0:11:39.78,000 --> 0:11:41,000
guide her to access her bravery.

240
0:11:42.54,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Ultimately, maybe that hill really is too steep,

241
0:11:46.82,000 --> 0:11:49,000
but she'll come to that conclusion through courage, not fear.

242
0:11:51.74,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Because this is not about the steep hill in front of her.

243
0:11:55.66,000 --> 0:11:56,000
This is about the life ahead of her

244
0:11:58.22,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and that she has the tools

245
0:12:00.02,000 --> 0:12:02,000
to handle and assess

246
0:12:02.14,000 --> 0:12:05,000
all the dangers that we cannot protect her from,

247
0:12:05.42,000 --> 0:12:08,000
all the challenges that we won't be there to guide her through,

248
0:12:09.98,000 --> 0:12:11,000
everything that our girls here

249
0:12:12.46,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and around the world

250
0:12:13.86,000 --> 0:12:14,000
face in their future.

251
0:12:18.02,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So by the way,

252
0:12:20.22,000 --> 0:12:22,000
the world record for crawling today --

253
0:12:23.02,000 --> 0:12:25,000
(Laughter)

254
0:12:25.42,000 --> 0:12:28,000
is 35.18 miles,

255
0:12:30.34,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and I would really love to see a girl go break that.

256
0:12:33.82,000 --> 0:12:39,000
(Applause)

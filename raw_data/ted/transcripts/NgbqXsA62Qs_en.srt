0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
"When the crisis came,

3
0:00:18.521,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the serious limitations of existing economic and financial models

4
0:00:23.231,000 --> 0:00:24,000
immediately became apparent."

5
0:00:27.455,000 --> 0:00:31,000
"There is also a strong belief, which I share,

6
0:00:31.633,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that bad or oversimplistic and overconfident economics

7
0:00:36.621,000 --> 0:00:37,000
helped create the crisis."

8
0:00:38.55,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Now, you've probably all heard of similar criticism

9
0:00:41.131,000 --> 0:00:44,000
coming from people who are skeptical of capitalism.

10
0:00:44.806,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But this is different.

11
0:00:46.001,000 --> 0:00:49,000
This is coming from the heart of finance.

12
0:00:49.704,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The first quote is from Jean-Claude Trichet

13
0:00:52.628,000 --> 0:00:54,000
when he was governor of the European Central Bank.

14
0:00:56.44,000 --> 0:01:,000
The second quote is from the head of the UK Financial Services Authority.

15
0:01:02.275,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Are these people implying

16
0:01:03.846,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that we don't understand the economic systems

17
0:01:06.61,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that drive our modern societies?

18
0:01:09.779,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It gets worse.

19
0:01:11.704,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"We spend billions of dollars

20
0:01:13.917,000 --> 0:01:16,000
trying to understand the origins of the universe,

21
0:01:17.903,000 --> 0:01:22,000
while we still don't understand the conditions for a stable society,

22
0:01:23.797,000 --> 0:01:26,000
a functioning economy, or peace."

23
0:01:29.437,000 --> 0:01:31,000
What's happening here? How can this be possible?

24
0:01:32.233,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Do we really understand more about the fabric of reality

25
0:01:35.504,000 --> 0:01:38,000
than we do about the fabric which emerges from our human interactions?

26
0:01:39.99,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Unfortunately, the answer is yes.

27
0:01:42.517,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But there's an intriguing solution

28
0:01:45.258,000 --> 0:01:49,000
which is coming from what is known as the science of complexity.

29
0:01:51.045,000 --> 0:01:53,000
To explain what this means and what this thing is,

30
0:01:53.756,000 --> 0:01:55,000
please let me quickly take a couple of steps back.

31
0:01:57.231,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I ended up in physics by accident.

32
0:01:59.473,000 --> 0:02:02,000
It was a random encounter when I was young,

33
0:02:02.611,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and since then, I've often wondered about the amazing success of physics

34
0:02:07.229,000 --> 0:02:09,000
in describing the reality we wake up in every day.

35
0:02:11.401,000 --> 0:02:13,000
In a nutshell, you can think of physics as follows.

36
0:02:14.164,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So you take a chunk of reality you want to understand

37
0:02:17.782,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and you translate it into mathematics.

38
0:02:21.411,000 --> 0:02:22,000
You encode it into equations.

39
0:02:24.402,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Then, predictions can be made and tested.

40
0:02:28.384,000 --> 0:02:3,000
We're actually really lucky that this works,

41
0:02:30.896,000 --> 0:02:32,000
because no one really knows why the thoughts in our heads

42
0:02:33.808,000 --> 0:02:36,000
should actually relate to the fundamental workings of the universe.

43
0:02:39.538,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Despite the success, physics has its limits.

44
0:02:42.948,000 --> 0:02:45,000
As Dirk Helbing pointed out in the last quote,

45
0:02:46.022,000 --> 0:02:5,000
we don't really understand the complexity that relates to us, that surrounds us.

46
0:02:51.861,000 --> 0:02:55,000
This paradox is what got me interested in complex systems.

47
0:02:55.989,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So these are systems which are made up

48
0:02:57.889,000 --> 0:03:,000
of many interconnected or interacting parts:

49
0:03:01.373,000 --> 0:03:03,000
swarms of birds or fish,

50
0:03:04.206,000 --> 0:03:08,000
ant colonies, ecosystems, brains, financial markets.

51
0:03:08.781,000 --> 0:03:09,000
These are just a few examples.

52
0:03:12.947,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Interestingly, complex systems are very hard to map

53
0:03:18.19,000 --> 0:03:19,000
into mathematical equations,

54
0:03:20.213,000 --> 0:03:23,000
so the usual physics approach doesn't really work here.

55
0:03:24.543,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So what do we know about complex systems?

56
0:03:26.736,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Well, it turns out that what looks like complex behavior from the outside

57
0:03:32.792,000 --> 0:03:35,000
is actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction.

58
0:03:38.255,000 --> 0:03:41,000
This means you can forget about the equations

59
0:03:42.119,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and just start to understand the system

60
0:03:44.869,000 --> 0:03:45,000
by looking at the interactions,

61
0:03:46.612,000 --> 0:03:48,000
so you can actually forget about the equations

62
0:03:49.006,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and you just start to look at the interactions.

63
0:03:51.582,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And it gets even better, because most complex systems

64
0:03:54.94,000 --> 0:03:56,000
have this amazing property called emergence.

65
0:03:57.958,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior

66
0:04:02.173,000 --> 0:04:04,000
which cannot be understood or predicted

67
0:04:05.069,000 --> 0:04:07,000
by looking at the components of the system.

68
0:04:07.646,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts.

69
0:04:11.919,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And all of this also means

70
0:04:13.217,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that you can forget about the individual parts of the system,

71
0:04:18.105,000 --> 0:04:19,000
how complex they are.

72
0:04:19.45,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So if it's a cell or a termite or a bird,

73
0:04:24.462,000 --> 0:04:26,000
you just focus on the rules of interaction.

74
0:04:29.21,000 --> 0:04:34,000
As a result, networks are ideal representations of complex systems.

75
0:04:36.362,000 --> 0:04:4,000
The nodes in the network are the system's components,

76
0:04:42.109,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and the links are given by the interactions.

77
0:04:45.874,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So what equations are for physics,

78
0:04:48.177,000 --> 0:04:51,000
complex networks are for the study of complex systems.

79
0:04:52.924,000 --> 0:04:55,000
This approach has been very successfully applied

80
0:04:56.158,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to many complex systems in physics, biology,

81
0:04:59.776,000 --> 0:05:01,000
computer science, the social sciences,

82
0:05:02.52,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but what about economics?

83
0:05:04.817,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Where are economic networks?

84
0:05:07.373,000 --> 0:05:1,000
This is a surprising and prominent gap in the literature.

85
0:05:12.243,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The study we published last year, called "The Network of Global Corporate Control,"

86
0:05:18.097,000 --> 0:05:22,000
was the first extensive analysis of economic networks.

87
0:05:23.914,000 --> 0:05:25,000
The study went viral on the Internet

88
0:05:26.5,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and it attracted a lot of attention from the international media.

89
0:05:31.506,000 --> 0:05:35,000
This is quite remarkable, because, again, why did no one look at this before?

90
0:05:35.749,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Similar data has been around for quite some time.

91
0:05:38.832,000 --> 0:05:41,000
What we looked at in detail was ownership networks.

92
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So here the nodes are companies, people, governments, foundations, etc.

93
0:05:51.384,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And the links represent the shareholding relations,

94
0:05:54.292,000 --> 0:05:59,000
so shareholder A has x percent of the shares in company B.

95
0:05:59.48,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue.

96
0:06:05.038,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So ownership networks reveal the patterns of shareholding relations.

97
0:06:11.305,000 --> 0:06:15,000
In this little example, you can see a few financial institutions

98
0:06:15.454,000 --> 0:06:17,000
with some of the many links highlighted.

99
0:06:19.105,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Now, you may think that no one looked at this before

100
0:06:21.974,000 --> 0:06:25,000
because ownership networks are really, really boring to study.

101
0:06:27.201,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Well, as ownership is related to control,

102
0:06:31.291,000 --> 0:06:32,000
as I shall explain later,

103
0:06:32.848,000 --> 0:06:33,000
looking at ownership networks

104
0:06:34.289,000 --> 0:06:36,000
actually can give you answers to questions like,

105
0:06:36.991,000 --> 0:06:37,000
who are the key players?

106
0:06:38.464,000 --> 0:06:4,000
How are they organized? Are they isolated?

107
0:06:40.814,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Are they interconnected?

108
0:06:42.483,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And what is the overall distribution of control?

109
0:06:46.413,000 --> 0:06:49,000
In other words, who controls the world?

110
0:06:49.675,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I think this is an interesting question.

111
0:06:52.041,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And it has implications for systemic risk.

112
0:06:56.608,000 --> 0:07:,000
This is a measure of how vulnerable a system is overall.

113
0:07:02.122,000 --> 0:07:05,000
A high degree of interconnectivity can be bad for stability,

114
0:07:06.784,000 --> 0:07:1,000
because then the stress can spread through the system like an epidemic.

115
0:07:13.592,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Scientists have sometimes criticized economists

116
0:07:16.149,000 --> 0:07:2,000
who believe ideas and concepts are more important than empirical data,

117
0:07:21.68,000 --> 0:07:23,000
because a foundational guideline in science is:

118
0:07:25.218,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Let the data speak. OK. Let's do that.

119
0:07:27.875,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So we started with a database containing 13 million ownership relations from 2007.

120
0:07:34.841,000 --> 0:07:37,000
This is a lot of data, and because we wanted to find out

121
0:07:38.152,000 --> 0:07:4,000
"who rules the world,"

122
0:07:40.284,000 --> 0:07:43,000
we decided to focus on transnational corporations,

123
0:07:43.712,000 --> 0:07:44,000
or "TNCs," for short.

124
0:07:45.06,000 --> 0:07:48,000
These are companies that operate in more than one country,

125
0:07:48.656,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and we found 43,000.

126
0:07:52.408,000 --> 0:07:54,000
In the next step, we built the network around these companies,

127
0:07:55.393,000 --> 0:07:57,000
so we took all the TNCs' shareholders,

128
0:07:57.773,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and the shareholders' shareholders, etc.,

129
0:07:59.756,000 --> 0:08:01,000
all the way upstream, and we did the same downstream,

130
0:08:02.632,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and ended up with a network containing 600,000 nodes

131
0:08:06.784,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and one million links.

132
0:08:08.57,000 --> 0:08:1,000
This is the TNC network which we analyzed.

133
0:08:12.511,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And it turns out to be structured as follows.

134
0:08:14.644,000 --> 0:08:16,000
So you have a periphery and a center

135
0:08:17.195,000 --> 0:08:21,000
which contains about 75 percent of all the players,

136
0:08:22.199,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and in the center, there's this tiny but dominant core

137
0:08:26.274,000 --> 0:08:29,000
which is made up of highly interconnected companies.

138
0:08:30.376,000 --> 0:08:32,000
To give you a better picture,

139
0:08:32.666,000 --> 0:08:33,000
think about a metropolitan area.

140
0:08:34.331,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So you have the suburbs and the periphery,

141
0:08:36.361,000 --> 0:08:38,000
you have a center, like a financial district,

142
0:08:39.218,000 --> 0:08:4,000
then the core will be something like

143
0:08:40.968,000 --> 0:08:42,000
the tallest high-rise building in the center.

144
0:08:44.992,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And we already see signs of organization going on here.

145
0:08:49.61,000 --> 0:08:54,000
36 percent of the TNCs are in the core only,

146
0:08:54.848,000 --> 0:09:,000
but they make up 95 percent of the total operating revenue of all TNCs.

147
0:09:02.014,000 --> 0:09:04,000
OK, so now we analyzed the structure,

148
0:09:04.64,000 --> 0:09:06,000
so how does this relate to the control?

149
0:09:08.777,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Well, ownership gives voting rights to shareholders.

150
0:09:12.447,000 --> 0:09:14,000
This is the normal notion of control.

151
0:09:15.221,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And there are different models

152
0:09:16.713,000 --> 0:09:19,000
which allow you to compute the control you get from ownership.

153
0:09:21.178,000 --> 0:09:23,000
If you have more than 50 percent of the shares in a company,

154
0:09:24.026,000 --> 0:09:25,000
you get control,

155
0:09:25.375,000 --> 0:09:28,000
but usually, it depends on the relative distribution of shares.

156
0:09:30.352,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And the network really matters.

157
0:09:33.575,000 --> 0:09:35,000
About 10 years ago, Mr. Tronchetti Provera

158
0:09:36.524,000 --> 0:09:39,000
had ownership and control in a small company,

159
0:09:39.959,000 --> 0:09:41,000
which had ownership and control in a bigger company.

160
0:09:43.146,000 --> 0:09:44,000
You get the idea.

161
0:09:44.714,000 --> 0:09:49,000
This ended up giving him control in Telecom Italia with a leverage of 26.

162
0:09:51.75,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So this means that, with each euro he invested,

163
0:09:55.047,000 --> 0:09:58,000
he was able to move 26 euros of market value

164
0:09:59.015,000 --> 0:10:01,000
through the chain of ownership relations.

165
0:10:02.435,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Now what we actually computed in our study was the control over the TNCs' value.

166
0:10:09.295,000 --> 0:10:13,000
This allowed us to assign a degree of influence to each shareholder.

167
0:10:15.025,000 --> 0:10:19,000
This is very much in the sense of Max Weber's idea of potential power,

168
0:10:20.124,000 --> 0:10:23,000
which is the probability of imposing one's own will

169
0:10:23.615,000 --> 0:10:24,000
despite the opposition of others.

170
0:10:27.666,000 --> 0:10:31,000
If you want to compute the flow in an ownership network,

171
0:10:32.447,000 --> 0:10:33,000
this is what you have to do.

172
0:10:33.828,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It's actually not that hard to understand.

173
0:10:36.046,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Let me explain by giving you this analogy.

174
0:10:39.077,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So think about water flowing in pipes, where the pipes have different thickness.

175
0:10:44.851,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So similarly, the control is flowing in the ownership networks

176
0:10:50.229,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and is accumulating at the nodes.

177
0:10:54.333,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So what did we find after computing all this network control?

178
0:10:58.385,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Well, it turns out that the 737 top shareholders

179
0:11:03.77,000 --> 0:11:08,000
have the potential to collectively control 80 percent of the TNCs' value.

180
0:11:10.988,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Now remember, we started out with 600,000 nodes,

181
0:11:13.717,000 --> 0:11:19,000
so these 737 top players make up a bit more than 0.1 percent.

182
0:11:21.434,000 --> 0:11:25,000
They're mostly financial institutions in the US and the UK.

183
0:11:26.345,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And it gets even more extreme.

184
0:11:29.312,000 --> 0:11:32,000
There are 146 top players in the core,

185
0:11:34.239,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and they together have the potential to collectively control

186
0:11:37.465,000 --> 0:11:4,000
40 percent of the TNCs' value.

187
0:11:43.341,000 --> 0:11:45,000
What should you take home from all of this?

188
0:11:45.639,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Well, the high degree of control you saw is very extreme by any standard.

189
0:11:54.545,000 --> 0:11:58,000
The high degree of interconnectivity of the top players in the core

190
0:11:59.527,000 --> 0:12:03,000
could pose a significant systemic risk to the global economy.

191
0:12:05.22,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And we could easily reproduce the TNC network

192
0:12:07.726,000 --> 0:12:08,000
with a few simple rules.

193
0:12:10.026,000 --> 0:12:13,000
This means that its structure is probably the result of self-organization.

194
0:12:14.09,000 --> 0:12:19,000
It's an emergent property which depends on the rules of interaction in the system,

195
0:12:19.957,000 --> 0:12:22,000
so it's probably not the result of a top-down approach

196
0:12:23.796,000 --> 0:12:24,000
like a global conspiracy.

197
0:12:27.359,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Our study "is an impression of the moon's surface.

198
0:12:29.982,000 --> 0:12:3,000
It's not a street map."

199
0:12:31.315,000 --> 0:12:34,000
So you should take the exact numbers in our study with a grain of salt,

200
0:12:35.149,000 --> 0:12:41,000
yet it "gave us a tantalizing glimpse of a brave new world of finance."

201
0:12:43.448,000 --> 0:12:47,000
We hope to have opened the door for more such research in this direction,

202
0:12:47.501,000 --> 0:12:51,000
so the remaining unknown terrain will be charted in the future.

203
0:12:52.296,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And this is slowly starting.

204
0:12:53.901,000 --> 0:12:58,000
We're seeing the emergence of long-term and highly-funded programs

205
0:12:59.016,000 --> 0:13:02,000
which aim at understanding our networked world

206
0:13:02.667,000 --> 0:13:03,000
from a complexity point of view.

207
0:13:05.121,000 --> 0:13:06,000
But this journey has only just begun,

208
0:13:06.943,000 --> 0:13:09,000
so we will have to wait before we see the first results.

209
0:13:12.67,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Now there is still a big problem, in my opinion.

210
0:13:16.801,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Ideas relating to finance, economics, politics, society,

211
0:13:22.75,000 --> 0:13:25,000
are very often tainted by people's personal ideologies.

212
0:13:28.708,000 --> 0:13:31,000
I really hope that this complexity perspective

213
0:13:32.857,000 --> 0:13:35,000
allows for some common ground to be found.

214
0:13:38.237,000 --> 0:13:4,000
It would be really great if it has the power

215
0:13:40.498,000 --> 0:13:45,000
to help end the gridlock created by conflicting ideas,

216
0:13:45.651,000 --> 0:13:48,000
which appears to be paralyzing our globalized world.

217
0:13:50.832,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Reality is so complex, we need to move away from dogma.

218
0:13:55.62,000 --> 0:13:57,000
But this is just my own personal ideology.

219
0:13:58.201,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Thank you.

220
0:13:59.376,000 --> 0:14:05,000
(Applause)

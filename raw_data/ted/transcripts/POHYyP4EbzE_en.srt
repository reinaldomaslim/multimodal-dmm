0:00:12.912,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Kashmir Hill: So for my birthday last year,

2
0:00:15.071,000 --> 0:00:16,000
my husband got me an Amazon Echo.

3
0:00:17.595,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I was kind of shocked, actually,

4
0:00:19.159,000 --> 0:00:22,000
because we both work in privacy and security.

5
0:00:22.417,000 --> 0:00:23,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:24.688,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And this was a device that would sit in the middle of our home

7
0:00:28.101,000 --> 0:00:29,000
with a microphone on,

8
0:00:29.561,000 --> 0:00:3,000
constantly listening.

9
0:00:31.696,000 --> 0:00:32,000
We're not alone, though.

10
0:00:32.974,000 --> 0:00:34,000
According to a survey by NPR and Edison Research,

11
0:00:35.879,000 --> 0:00:39,000
one in six American adults now has a smart speaker,

12
0:00:39.982,000 --> 0:00:41,000
which means that they have a virtual assistant at home.

13
0:00:42.887,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Like, that's wild.

14
0:00:44.109,000 --> 0:00:48,000
The future, or the future dystopia, is getting here fast.

15
0:00:48.778,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Beyond that, companies are offering us all kinds of internet-connected devices.

16
0:00:53.309,000 --> 0:00:57,000
There are smart lights, smart locks, smart toilets, smart toys,

17
0:00:58.301,000 --> 0:00:59,000
smart sex toys.

18
0:01:00.323,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Being smart means the device can connect to the internet,

19
0:01:03.038,000 --> 0:01:04,000
it can gather data,

20
0:01:04.238,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and it can talk to its owner.

21
0:01:06.966,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But once your appliances can talk to you,

22
0:01:09.704,000 --> 0:01:11,000
who else are they going to be talking to?

23
0:01:12.331,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I wanted to find out,

24
0:01:13.72,000 --> 0:01:16,000
so I went all-in and turned my one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco

25
0:01:17.132,000 --> 0:01:18,000
into a smart home.

26
0:01:18.8,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I even connected our bed to the internet.

27
0:01:22.505,000 --> 0:01:25,000
As far as I know, it was just measuring our sleeping habits.

28
0:01:26.49,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I can now tell you that the only thing worse

29
0:01:28.595,000 --> 0:01:29,000
than getting a terrible night's sleep

30
0:01:30.406,000 --> 0:01:32,000
is to have your smart bed tell you the next day

31
0:01:32.847,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that you "missed your goal and got a low sleep score."

32
0:01:35.927,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:37.331,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It's like, "Thanks, smart bed.

34
0:01:38.792,000 --> 0:01:4,000
As if I didn't already feel like shit today."

35
0:01:41.332,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:42.509,000 --> 0:01:46,000
All together, I installed 18 internet-connected devices in my home.

37
0:01:47.069,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I also installed a Surya.

38
0:01:49.331,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Surya Mattu: Hi, I'm Surya.

39
0:01:50.736,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:51.958,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I monitored everything the smart home did.

41
0:01:54.926,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I built a special router that let me look at all the network activity.

42
0:01:58.879,000 --> 0:02:,000
You can think of my router sort of like a security guard,

43
0:02:01.833,000 --> 0:02:03,000
compulsively logging all the network packets

44
0:02:03.99,000 --> 0:02:05,000
as they entered and left the smart home.

45
0:02:06.061,000 --> 0:02:08,000
KH: Surya and I are both journalists, he's not my husband,

46
0:02:08.839,000 --> 0:02:09,000
we just work together at Gizmodo.

47
0:02:10.539,000 --> 0:02:11,000
SM: Thank you for clarifying.

48
0:02:11.952,000 --> 0:02:12,000
The devices Kashmir bought --

49
0:02:13.378,000 --> 0:02:14,000
we were interested in understanding

50
0:02:15.094,000 --> 0:02:17,000
what they were saying to their manufacturers.

51
0:02:17.229,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But we were also interested in understanding

52
0:02:19.315,000 --> 0:02:21,000
what the home's digital emissions look like

53
0:02:21.709,000 --> 0:02:23,000
to the internet service provider.

54
0:02:23.998,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We were seeing what the ISP could see, but more importantly,

55
0:02:26.864,000 --> 0:02:27,000
what they could sell.

56
0:02:28.069,000 --> 0:02:3,000
KH: We ran the experiment for two months.

57
0:02:30.236,000 --> 0:02:31,000
In that two months,

58
0:02:31.427,000 --> 0:02:33,000
there wasn't a single hour of digital silence in the house --

59
0:02:34.328,000 --> 0:02:35,000
not even when we went away for a week.

60
0:02:36.284,000 --> 0:02:37,000
SM: Yeah, it's so true.

61
0:02:37.482,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Based on the data, I knew when you guys woke up and went to bed.

62
0:02:40.522,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I even knew when Kashmir brushed her teeth.

63
0:02:42.585,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I'm not going to out your brushing habits,

64
0:02:44.633,000 --> 0:02:47,000
but let's just say it was very clear to me when you were working from home.

65
0:02:48.286,000 --> 0:02:51,000
KH: Uh, I think you just outed them to, like, a lot of people here.

66
0:02:51.522,000 --> 0:02:53,000
SM: Don't be embarrassed, it's just metadata.

67
0:02:54.472,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I knew when you turned on your TV and how long you watched it for.

68
0:02:57.639,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Fun fact about the Hill household:

69
0:02:59.292,000 --> 0:03:,000
they don't watch a lot of television,

70
0:03:01.11,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but when they do, it's usually in binge mode.

71
0:03:03.402,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Favorite shows include "Difficult People" and "Party Down."

72
0:03:06.205,000 --> 0:03:08,000
KH: OK, you're right, I loved "Party Down."

73
0:03:08.268,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It's a great show, and you should definitely watch it.

74
0:03:10.839,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But "Difficult People" was all my husband, Trevor.

75
0:03:13.307,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And Trevor was actually a little upset that you knew about his binges,

76
0:03:16.934,000 --> 0:03:19,000
because even though he'd been the one to connect the TV to the router,

77
0:03:20.292,000 --> 0:03:22,000
he forgot that the TV was watching us.

78
0:03:23.109,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It's actually not the first time that our TV has spied on us.

79
0:03:26.426,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The company that made it, VIZIO,

80
0:03:28.149,000 --> 0:03:32,000
paid a 2.2 million-dollar settlement to the government just last year,

81
0:03:32.506,000 --> 0:03:35,000
because it had been collecting second-by-second information

82
0:03:35.887,000 --> 0:03:38,000
about what millions of people were watching on TV, including us,

83
0:03:39.379,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and then it was selling that information to data brokers and advertisers.

84
0:03:43.108,000 --> 0:03:46,000
SM: Ah, classic surveillance economy move.

85
0:03:46.775,000 --> 0:03:49,000
The devices Kashmir bought almost all pinged their servers daily.

86
0:03:50.665,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But do you know which device was especially chatty?

87
0:03:53.085,000 --> 0:03:54,000
The Amazon Echo.

88
0:03:54.403,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It contacted its servers every three minutes,

89
0:03:56.855,000 --> 0:03:58,000
regardless of whether you were using it or not.

90
0:03:59.077,000 --> 0:04:01,000
KH: In general, it was disconcerting

91
0:04:01.284,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that all these devices were having ongoing conversations

92
0:04:04.292,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that were invisible to me.

93
0:04:05.942,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I mean, I would have had no idea, without your router.

94
0:04:08.553,000 --> 0:04:11,000
If you buy a smart device, you should probably know --

95
0:04:12.045,000 --> 0:04:14,000
you're going to own the device,

96
0:04:14.18,000 --> 0:04:17,000
but in general, the company is going to own your data.

97
0:04:17.624,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And you know, I mean, maybe that's to be expected --

98
0:04:20.22,000 --> 0:04:23,000
you buy an internet-connected device, it's going to use the internet.

99
0:04:24.189,000 --> 0:04:25,000
But it's strange to have these devices

100
0:04:26.055,000 --> 0:04:28,000
moving into the intimate space that is the home

101
0:04:28.737,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and allowing companies to track our really basic behavior there.

102
0:04:32.204,000 --> 0:04:33,000
SM: So true.

103
0:04:33.387,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Even the most banal-seeming data can be mined by the surveillance economy.

104
0:04:36.95,000 --> 0:04:38,000
For example, who cares how often you brush your teeth?

105
0:04:39.549,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Well, as it turns out, there's a dental insurance company called Beam.

106
0:04:43.099,000 --> 0:04:46,000
They've been monitoring their customers' smart toothbrushes since 2015 --

107
0:04:46.958,000 --> 0:04:48,000
for discounts on their premiums, of course.

108
0:04:49.561,000 --> 0:04:51,000
KH: We know what some of you are thinking:

109
0:04:51.844,000 --> 0:04:53,000
this is the contract of the modern world.

110
0:04:54.522,000 --> 0:04:55,000
You give up a little privacy,

111
0:04:55.973,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and you get some convenience or some price breaks in return.

112
0:04:59.514,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But that wasn't my experience in my smart home.

113
0:05:01.879,000 --> 0:05:04,000
It wasn't convenient, it was infuriating.

114
0:05:05.577,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I'll admit, I love my smart vacuum,

115
0:05:08.093,000 --> 0:05:1,000
but many other things in the house drove me insane:

116
0:05:10.522,000 --> 0:05:12,000
we ran out of electrical outlets,

117
0:05:12.942,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and I had to download over a dozen apps to my phone

118
0:05:16.345,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to control everything.

119
0:05:17.696,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And then every device had its own log-in,

120
0:05:19.809,000 --> 0:05:21,000
my toothbrush had a password ...

121
0:05:22.196,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:23.957,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And smart coffee, especially, was just a world of hell.

123
0:05:28.109,000 --> 0:05:31,000
SM: Wait, really? Cloud-powered coffee wasn't really working for you?

124
0:05:32.061,000 --> 0:05:35,000
KH: I mean, maybe I'm naive, but I thought it was going to be great.

125
0:05:35.323,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I thought we'd just wake up in the morning and we'd say, "Alexa, make us coffee."

126
0:05:39.366,000 --> 0:05:4,000
But that's not how it went down.

127
0:05:41.263,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We had to use this really particular, brand-specific phrase to make it work.

128
0:05:45.938,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It was, "Alexa, ask the Behmor to run quick start."

129
0:05:51.222,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And this was just, like, really hard to remember

130
0:05:54.588,000 --> 0:05:55,000
first thing in the morning,

131
0:05:55.946,000 --> 0:05:56,000
before you have had your caffeine.

132
0:05:57.673,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Laughter)

133
0:05:58.8,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And apparently, it was hard to say,

134
0:06:00.514,000 --> 0:06:03,000
because the Echo Dot that was right next to our bed

135
0:06:03.601,000 --> 0:06:04,000
just couldn't understand us.

136
0:06:05.704,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So we would basically start every day by screaming this phrase at the Echo Dot.

137
0:06:10.349,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Laughter)

138
0:06:11.546,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And Trevor hated this.

139
0:06:13.339,000 --> 0:06:14,000
He'd be like, "Please, Kashmir,

140
0:06:15.111,000 --> 0:06:18,000
just let me go to the kitchen and push the button to make the coffee run."

141
0:06:19.379,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And I'd be like, "No, you can't!

142
0:06:21.49,000 --> 0:06:23,000
We have to do it the smart way!"

143
0:06:23.923,000 --> 0:06:24,000
(Laughter)

144
0:06:25.863,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I'm happy to report that our marriage survived the experiment,

145
0:06:28.93,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but just barely.

146
0:06:30.514,000 --> 0:06:32,000
SM: If you decide to make your home smart,

147
0:06:32.585,000 --> 0:06:34,000
hopefully, you’ll find it less infuriating than Kashmir did.

148
0:06:35.458,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But regardless, the smart things you buy

149
0:06:37.569,000 --> 0:06:4,000
can and probably are used to target and profile you.

150
0:06:41.141,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Just the number of devices you have can be used to predict

151
0:06:44.205,000 --> 0:06:45,000
how rich or poor you are.

152
0:06:45.651,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Facebook's made this tech, and they've also patented it.

153
0:06:48.442,000 --> 0:06:51,000
KH: All the anxiety you currently feel every time you go online,

154
0:06:52.152,000 --> 0:06:53,000
about being tracked,

155
0:06:53.482,000 --> 0:06:55,000
is about to move into your living room.

156
0:06:55.807,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Or into your bedroom.

157
0:06:57.95,000 --> 0:06:59,000
There's this sex toy called the We-Vibe.

158
0:07:00.577,000 --> 0:07:02,000
You might wonder why a sex toy connects to the internet,

159
0:07:03.268,000 --> 0:07:06,000
but it's for two people who are in a long-distance relationship,

160
0:07:06.728,000 --> 0:07:08,000
so they can share their love from afar.

161
0:07:10.259,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Some hackers took a close look at this toy

162
0:07:12.399,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and saw it was sending a lot of information

163
0:07:14.498,000 --> 0:07:16,000
back to the company that made it --

164
0:07:16.984,000 --> 0:07:18,000
when it was used, how long it was used for,

165
0:07:19.974,000 --> 0:07:22,000
what the vibration settings were, how hot the toy got.

166
0:07:23.704,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It was all going into a database.

167
0:07:25.917,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So I reached out to the company,

168
0:07:28.69,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and I said, "Why are you collecting this really sensitive data?"

169
0:07:32.369,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And they said, "Well, it's great for market research."

170
0:07:36.592,000 --> 0:07:38,000
But they were data-mining their customers' orgasms.

171
0:07:39.545,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And they weren't telling them about it.

172
0:07:41.49,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I mean, even if you're cavalier about privacy,

173
0:07:43.736,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I hope that you would admit that's a step too far.

174
0:07:46.68,000 --> 0:07:48,000
SM: This is why I want to keep my sex toys dumb.

175
0:07:49.212,000 --> 0:07:5,000
KH: That's great.

176
0:07:50.402,000 --> 0:07:51,000
We're all very glad to know that.

177
0:07:52.092,000 --> 0:07:53,000
(Laughter)

178
0:07:53.564,000 --> 0:07:55,000
SM: A data point I'm willing to share.

179
0:07:55.622,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Laughter)

180
0:07:57.369,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The devices Kashmir bought range from useful to annoying.

181
0:08:00.363,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But the thing they all had in common

182
0:08:02.18,000 --> 0:08:04,000
was sharing data with the companies that made them.

183
0:08:04.903,000 --> 0:08:06,000
With email service providers and social media,

184
0:08:07.235,000 --> 0:08:09,000
we've long been told that if it's free, you're the product.

185
0:08:10.217,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But with the internet of things, it seems,

186
0:08:12.248,000 --> 0:08:14,000
even if you pay, you're still the product.

187
0:08:14.28,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So you really have to ask:

188
0:08:15.549,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Who's the true beneficiary of your smart home,

189
0:08:17.758,000 --> 0:08:18,000
you or the company mining you?

190
0:08:19.411,000 --> 0:08:2,000
KH: Look, we're a tech savvy crowd here.

191
0:08:21.387,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I think most of us know that these things connect to the internet

192
0:08:24.523,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and send data out.

193
0:08:25.71,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And fine, maybe you're OK with living in that commercial panopticon,

194
0:08:29.752,000 --> 0:08:3,000
but others aren't.

195
0:08:31.173,000 --> 0:08:33,000
We need the companies to rethink the design of these devices

196
0:08:34.038,000 --> 0:08:35,000
with our privacy in mind,

197
0:08:35.577,000 --> 0:08:38,000
because we're not all willing to participate in "market research,"

198
0:08:38.712,000 --> 0:08:4,000
just because a device we bought has a Wi-Fi connection.

199
0:08:42.014,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And I have to tell you,

200
0:08:43.236,000 --> 0:08:45,000
even when you're aware, generally, this is happening,

201
0:08:45.842,000 --> 0:08:49,000
it's really easy to forget that normal household items are spying on you.

202
0:08:50.664,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It's easy to forget these things are watching you,

203
0:08:53.038,000 --> 0:08:55,000
because they don't look like cameras.

204
0:08:55.109,000 --> 0:08:56,000
They could look like ...

205
0:08:56.562,000 --> 0:08:58,000
well, they could look like a dildo.

206
0:08:59.78,000 --> 0:09:,000
Thank you.

207
0:09:00.956,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Applause)

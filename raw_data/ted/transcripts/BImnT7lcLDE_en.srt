2
0:00:13.615,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So I grew up in East Los Angeles,

3
0:00:16.115,000 --> 0:00:18,000
not even realizing I was poor.

4
0:00:18.286,000 --> 0:00:22,000
My dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets.

5
0:00:22.403,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Everyone knew who I was,

6
0:00:23.702,000 --> 0:00:26,000
so I thought I was a pretty big deal, and I was protected,

7
0:00:27.152,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and even though my dad spent most of my life

8
0:00:29.721,000 --> 0:00:3,000
in and out of jail,

9
0:00:31.07,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent.

10
0:00:35.571,000 --> 0:00:36,000
She worked at the local high school

11
0:00:37.08,000 --> 0:00:39,000
as a secretary in the dean's office,

12
0:00:39.635,000 --> 0:00:41,000
so she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class,

13
0:00:42.325,000 --> 0:00:44,000
for whatever reason, who were waiting to be disciplined.

14
0:00:45.163,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Man, her office was packed.

15
0:00:48.954,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So, see, kids like us, we have a lot of things to deal with

16
0:00:52.751,000 --> 0:00:53,000
outside of school,

17
0:00:54.309,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and sometimes we're just not ready to focus.

18
0:00:57.226,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But that doesn't mean that we can't.

19
0:00:59.556,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It just takes a little bit more.

20
0:01:01.743,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Like, I remember one day I found my dad

21
0:01:04.848,000 --> 0:01:06,000
convulsing, foaming at the mouth,

22
0:01:07.192,000 --> 0:01:09,000
OD-ing on the bathroom floor.

23
0:01:09.406,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Really, do you think that doing my homework that night

24
0:01:11.879,000 --> 0:01:13,000
was at the top of my priority list?

25
0:01:14.391,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Not so much.

26
0:01:15.858,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But I really needed a support network,

27
0:01:18.991,000 --> 0:01:2,000
a group of people who were going to help me

28
0:01:21.316,000 --> 0:01:23,000
make sure that I wasn't going to be

29
0:01:23.536,000 --> 0:01:25,000
a victim of my own circumstance,

30
0:01:26.191,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that they were going to push me

31
0:01:27.805,000 --> 0:01:29,000
beyond what I even thought I could do.

32
0:01:30.37,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I needed teachers, in the classroom, every day,

33
0:01:33.839,000 --> 0:01:36,000
who were going to say, "You can move beyond that."

34
0:01:37.584,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And unfortunately, the local junior high

35
0:01:40.862,000 --> 0:01:42,000
was not going to offer that.

36
0:01:42.971,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It was gang-infested, huge teacher turnover rate.

37
0:01:46.805,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So my mom said, "You're going on a bus

38
0:01:49.978,000 --> 0:01:54,000
an hour and a half away from where we live every day."

39
0:01:55.191,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So for the next two years, that's what I did.

40
0:01:57.553,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I took a school bus to the fancy side of town.

41
0:02:02.04,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And eventually, I ended up at a school

42
0:02:04.965,000 --> 0:02:05,000
where there was a mixture.

43
0:02:06.529,000 --> 0:02:08,000
There were some people who were really gang-affiliated,

44
0:02:09.207,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and then there were those of us

45
0:02:10.672,000 --> 0:02:11,000
really trying to make it to high school.

46
0:02:12.666,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Well, trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable.

47
0:02:16.169,000 --> 0:02:17,000
You had to survive.

48
0:02:17.883,000 --> 0:02:19,000
You just had to do things sometimes.

49
0:02:20.536,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So there were a lot of teachers who were like,

50
0:02:22.889,000 --> 0:02:23,000
"She's never going to make it.

51
0:02:24.315,000 --> 0:02:25,000
She has an issue with authority.

52
0:02:25.906,000 --> 0:02:26,000
She's not going to go anywhere."

53
0:02:27.549,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause.

54
0:02:31.642,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But then, they were very surprised

55
0:02:34.809,000 --> 0:02:37,000
when I graduated from high school.

56
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I was accepted to Pepperdine University,

57
0:02:40.862,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and I came back to the same school that I attended

58
0:02:43.985,000 --> 0:02:44,000
to be a special ed assistant.

59
0:02:45.896,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And then I told them, "I want to be a teacher."

60
0:02:50.449,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And boy, they were like, "What? Why?

61
0:02:53.673,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Why would you want to do that?"

62
0:02:55.193,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So I began my teaching career

63
0:02:57.479,000 --> 0:03:,000
at the exact same middle school that I attended,

64
0:03:01.007,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and I really wanted to try to save more kids

65
0:03:04.438,000 --> 0:03:06,000
who were just like me.

66
0:03:06.515,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And so every year, I share my background with my kids,

67
0:03:09.715,000 --> 0:03:12,000
because they need to know that everyone has a story,

68
0:03:12.772,000 --> 0:03:14,000
everyone has a struggle,

69
0:03:15.139,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and everyone needs help along the way.

70
0:03:18.893,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And I am going to be their help along the way.

71
0:03:23.021,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So as a rookie teacher, I created opportunity.

72
0:03:29.089,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I had a kid one day come into my class

73
0:03:31.735,000 --> 0:03:34,000
having been stabbed the night before.

74
0:03:34.943,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I was like, "You need to go to a hospital,

75
0:03:37.439,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the school nurse, something."

76
0:03:40.714,000 --> 0:03:42,000
He's like, "No, Miss, I'm not going.

77
0:03:42.875,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I need to be in class because I need to graduate."

78
0:03:45.643,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So he knew that I was not going to let him be a victim

79
0:03:49.035,000 --> 0:03:5,000
of his circumstance,

80
0:03:50.812,000 --> 0:03:54,000
but we were going to push forward and keep moving on.

81
0:03:54.85,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids

82
0:03:58.74,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and getting to know exactly what they're going through,

83
0:04:02.856,000 --> 0:04:05,000
getting to know their families -- I wanted that,

84
0:04:06.112,000 --> 0:04:11,000
but I couldn't do it in a school with 1,600 kids,

85
0:04:11.592,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and teachers turning over year after year after year.

86
0:04:15.066,000 --> 0:04:19,000
How do you get to build those relationships?

87
0:04:19.118,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So we created a new school.

88
0:04:22.705,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And we created

89
0:04:24.184,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the San Fernando Institute for Applied Media.

90
0:04:27.722,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And we made sure that we were still attached

91
0:04:31.194,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to our school district for funding, for support.

92
0:04:35.232,000 --> 0:04:38,000
But with that, we were going to gain freedom:

93
0:04:38.349,000 --> 0:04:4,000
freedom to hire the teachers

94
0:04:40.602,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that we knew were going to be effective;

95
0:04:43.924,000 --> 0:04:45,000
freedom to control the curriculum

96
0:04:46.664,000 --> 0:04:51,000
so that we're not doing lesson 1.2 on page five, no;

97
0:04:52.302,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and freedom to control a budget,

98
0:04:55.022,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to spend money where it matters,

99
0:04:57.606,000 --> 0:05:01,000
not how a district or a state says you have to do it.

100
0:05:01.847,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We wanted those freedoms.

101
0:05:04.15,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But now, shifting an entire paradigm,

102
0:05:06.726,000 --> 0:05:1,000
it hasn't been an easy journey, nor is it even complete.

103
0:05:10.871,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But we had to do it.

104
0:05:13.221,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Our community deserved a new way of doing things.

105
0:05:17.342,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And as the very first pilot middle school

106
0:05:20.868,000 --> 0:05:23,000
in all of Los Angeles Unified School District,

107
0:05:24.093,000 --> 0:05:26,000
you better believe there was some opposition.

108
0:05:27.069,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And it was out of fear --

109
0:05:29.192,000 --> 0:05:32,000
fear of, well, what if they get it wrong?

110
0:05:32.415,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Yeah, what if we get it wrong?

111
0:05:34.6,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But what if we get it right?

112
0:05:36.854,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And we did.

113
0:05:38.929,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So even though teachers were against it

114
0:05:41.54,000 --> 0:05:43,000
because we employ one-year contracts --

115
0:05:44.121,000 --> 0:05:48,000
you can't teach, or you don't want to teach,

116
0:05:48.19,000 --> 0:05:51,000
you don't get to be at my school with my kids.

117
0:05:51.25,000 --> 0:05:57,000
(Applause)

118
0:05:58.014,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So in our third year, how did we do it?

119
0:06:01.686,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Well, we're making school worth coming to every day.

120
0:06:05.117,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We make our kids feel like they matter to us.

121
0:06:07.878,000 --> 0:06:1,000
We make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them,

122
0:06:11.766,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and they use all the technology that they're used to.

123
0:06:14.351,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Laptops, computers, tablets -- you name it, they have it.

124
0:06:17.278,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Animation, software, moviemaking software, they have it all.

125
0:06:21.196,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And because we connect it to what they're doing —

126
0:06:25.009,000 --> 0:06:28,000
For example, they made public service announcements

127
0:06:28.211,000 --> 0:06:29,000
for the Cancer Society.

128
0:06:29.837,000 --> 0:06:31,000
These were played in the local trolley system.

129
0:06:32.661,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Teaching elements of persuasion,

130
0:06:34.668,000 --> 0:06:36,000
it doesn't get any more real than that.

131
0:06:37.588,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Our state test scores have gone up

132
0:06:39.749,000 --> 0:06:41,000
more than 80 points since we've become our own school.

133
0:06:42.738,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But it's taken all stakeholders, working together --

134
0:06:45.833,000 --> 0:06:48,000
teachers and principals on one-year contracts,

135
0:06:49.017,000 --> 0:06:52,000
working over and above and beyond their contract hours

136
0:06:52.841,000 --> 0:06:55,000
without compensation.

137
0:06:55.877,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And it takes a school board member

138
0:06:58.096,000 --> 0:06:59,000
who is going to lobby for you and say,

139
0:07:00.048,000 --> 0:07:02,000
"Know, the district is trying to impose this,

140
0:07:02.476,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but you have the freedom to do otherwise."

141
0:07:05.509,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And it takes an active parent center

142
0:07:08.073,000 --> 0:07:12,000
who is not only there, showing a presence every day,

143
0:07:12.153,000 --> 0:07:14,000
but who is part of our governance,

144
0:07:15.02,000 --> 0:07:2,000
making decisions for their kids, our kids.

145
0:07:20.024,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Because why should our students have to go

146
0:07:22.629,000 --> 0:07:24,000
so far away from where they live?

147
0:07:25.608,000 --> 0:07:28,000
They deserve a quality school in their neighborhood,

148
0:07:29.332,000 --> 0:07:32,000
a school that they can be proud to say they attend,

149
0:07:32.505,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and a school that the community can be proud of as well,

150
0:07:36.173,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and they need teachers to fight for them every day

151
0:07:40.371,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and empower them to move beyond their circumstances.

152
0:07:45.704,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Because it's time that kids like me

153
0:07:48.42,000 --> 0:07:52,000
stop being the exception, and we become the norm.

154
0:07:53.142,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Thank you.

155
0:07:54.451,000 --> 0:07:58,000
(Applause)

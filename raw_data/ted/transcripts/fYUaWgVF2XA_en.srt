1
0:00:12.462,000 --> 0:00:13,000
As humans, it's in our nature

2
0:00:14.161,000 --> 0:00:17,000
to want to improve our health and minimize our suffering.

3
0:00:17.455,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Whatever life throws at us,

4
0:00:19.122,000 --> 0:00:21,000
whether it's cancer, diabetes, heart disease,

5
0:00:21.587,000 --> 0:00:24,000
or even broken bones, we want to try and get better.

6
0:00:24.779,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Now I'm head of a biomaterials lab,

7
0:00:27.262,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and I'm really fascinated by the way that humans

8
0:00:30.002,000 --> 0:00:32,000
have used materials in really creative ways

9
0:00:32.47,000 --> 0:00:34,000
in the body over time.

10
0:00:35.214,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Take, for example, this beautiful blue nacre shell.

11
0:00:38.86,000 --> 0:00:39,000
This was actually used by the Mayans

12
0:00:40.742,000 --> 0:00:43,000
as an artificial tooth replacement.

13
0:00:44.281,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We're not quite sure why they did it.

14
0:00:45.914,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It's hard. It's durable.

15
0:00:48.49,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But it also had other very nice properties.

16
0:00:52.608,000 --> 0:00:54,000
In fact, when they put it into the jawbone,

17
0:00:54.888,000 --> 0:00:56,000
it could integrate into the jaw,

18
0:00:57.795,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and we know now with very sophisticated

19
0:00:59.893,000 --> 0:01:,000
imaging technologies

20
0:01:01.566,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that part of that integration comes from the fact

21
0:01:03.915,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that this material is designed

22
0:01:05.602,000 --> 0:01:07,000
in a very specific way, has a beautiful chemistry,

23
0:01:08.421,000 --> 0:01:1,000
has a beautiful architecture.

24
0:01:10.649,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And I think in many ways we can sort of think

25
0:01:12.401,000 --> 0:01:15,000
of the use of the blue nacre shell and the Mayans

26
0:01:15.408,000 --> 0:01:16,000
as the first real application

27
0:01:16.928,000 --> 0:01:18,000
of the bluetooth technology.

28
0:01:19.223,000 --> 0:01:2,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:20.685,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But if we move on and think throughout history

30
0:01:25.078,000 --> 0:01:27,000
how people have used different materials in the body,

31
0:01:28.062,000 --> 0:01:29,000
very often it's been physicians

32
0:01:29.776,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that have been quite creative.

33
0:01:31.168,000 --> 0:01:32,000
They've taken things off the shelf.

34
0:01:33.136,000 --> 0:01:34,000
One of my favorite examples

35
0:01:35.036,000 --> 0:01:38,000
is that of Sir Harold Ridley,

36
0:01:38.278,000 --> 0:01:4,000
who was a famous ophthalmologist,

37
0:01:40.416,000 --> 0:01:42,000
or at least became a famous ophthalmologist.

38
0:01:42.984,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And during World War II, what he would see

39
0:01:44.911,000 --> 0:01:46,000
would be pilots coming back from their missions,

40
0:01:47.763,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and he noticed that within their eyes

41
0:01:49.515,000 --> 0:01:51,000
they had shards of small bits of material

42
0:01:52.455,000 --> 0:01:53,000
lodged within the eye,

43
0:01:53.975,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but the very interesting thing about it

44
0:01:55.674,000 --> 0:01:57,000
was that material, actually, wasn't causing

45
0:01:57.967,000 --> 0:01:59,000
any inflammatory response.

46
0:01:59.98,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So he looked into this, and he figured out

47
0:02:02.319,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that actually that material was little shards of plastic

48
0:02:04.923,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that were coming from the canopy of the Spitfires.

49
0:02:07.662,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And this led him to propose that material

50
0:02:10.063,000 --> 0:02:12,000
as a new material for intraocular lenses.

51
0:02:12.825,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's called PMMA, and it's now used

52
0:02:14.93,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in millions of people every year

53
0:02:16.732,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and helps in preventing cataracts.

54
0:02:19.501,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And that example, I think, is a really nice one,

55
0:02:21.81,000 --> 0:02:23,000
because it helps remind us that in the early days,

56
0:02:24.245,000 --> 0:02:25,000
people often chose materials

57
0:02:26.198,000 --> 0:02:27,000
because they were bioinert.

58
0:02:28.083,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Their very purpose was to perform a mechanical function.

59
0:02:31.595,000 --> 0:02:32,000
You'd put them in the body

60
0:02:33.045,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and you wouldn't get an adverse response.

61
0:02:35.209,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And what I want to show you is that

62
0:02:36.877,000 --> 0:02:37,000
in regenerative medicine,

63
0:02:38.258,000 --> 0:02:39,000
we've really shifted away from that idea

64
0:02:40.082,000 --> 0:02:41,000
of taking a bioinert material.

65
0:02:41.995,000 --> 0:02:43,000
We're actually actively looking for materials

66
0:02:44.284,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that will be bioactive, that will interact with the body,

67
0:02:47.252,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and that furthermore we can put in the body,

68
0:02:49.579,000 --> 0:02:5,000
they'll have their function,

69
0:02:51.028,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and then they'll dissolve away over time.

70
0:02:55.578,000 --> 0:02:56,000
If we look at this schematic,

71
0:02:57.511,000 --> 0:02:58,000
this is showing you what we think of

72
0:02:59.112,000 --> 0:03:01,000
as the typical tissue-engineering approach.

73
0:03:01.249,000 --> 0:03:03,000
We have cells there, typically from the patient.

74
0:03:04.093,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We can put those onto a material,

75
0:03:05.975,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and we can make that material very complex if we want to,

76
0:03:08.708,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and we can then grow that up in the lab

77
0:03:10.878,000 --> 0:03:12,000
or we can put it straight back into the patient.

78
0:03:13.393,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And this is an approach that's used all over the world,

79
0:03:15.844,000 --> 0:03:18,000
including in our lab.

80
0:03:19.367,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But one of the things that's really important

81
0:03:21.824,000 --> 0:03:22,000
when we're thinking about stem cells

82
0:03:23.702,000 --> 0:03:25,000
is that obviously stem cells can be many different things,

83
0:03:26.281,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and they want to be many different things,

84
0:03:28.045,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and so we want to make sure that the environment

85
0:03:29.921,000 --> 0:03:31,000
we put them into has enough information

86
0:03:32.271,000 --> 0:03:33,000
so that they can become the right sort

87
0:03:34.267,000 --> 0:03:36,000
of specialist tissue.

88
0:03:36.953,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And if we think about the different types of tissues

89
0:03:40.016,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that people are looking at regenerating

90
0:03:42.035,000 --> 0:03:44,000
all over the world, in all the different labs in the world,

91
0:03:44.346,000 --> 0:03:46,000
there's pretty much every tissue you can think of.

92
0:03:47.282,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And actually, the structure of those tissues

93
0:03:48.904,000 --> 0:03:5,000
is quite different, and it's going to really depend

94
0:03:51.518,000 --> 0:03:53,000
on whether your patient has any underlying disease,

95
0:03:53.936,000 --> 0:03:56,000
other conditions, in terms of how

96
0:03:56.986,000 --> 0:03:57,000
you're going to regenerate your tissue,

97
0:03:58.547,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and you're going to need to think about the materials

98
0:04:00.532,000 --> 0:04:02,000
you're going to use really carefully,

99
0:04:02.586,000 --> 0:04:03,000
their biochemistry, their mechanics,

100
0:04:04.311,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and many other properties as well.

101
0:04:08.049,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Our tissues all have very different abilities to regenerate,

102
0:04:11.349,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and here we see poor Prometheus,

103
0:04:13.091,000 --> 0:04:16,000
who made a rather tricky career choice

104
0:04:16.184,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and was punished by the Greek gods.

105
0:04:19.118,000 --> 0:04:21,000
He was tied to a rock, and an eagle would come

106
0:04:21.439,000 --> 0:04:22,000
every day to eat his liver.

107
0:04:23.042,000 --> 0:04:25,000
But of course his liver would regenerate every day,

108
0:04:25.309,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and so day after day he was punished

109
0:04:27.581,000 --> 0:04:32,000
for eternity by the gods.

110
0:04:33.378,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And liver will regenerate in this very nice way,

111
0:04:37.258,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but actually if we think of other tissues,

112
0:04:39.034,000 --> 0:04:4,000
like cartilage, for example,

113
0:04:40.803,000 --> 0:04:42,000
even the simplest nick and you're going to find it

114
0:04:42.859,000 --> 0:04:44,000
really difficult to regenerate your cartilage.

115
0:04:45.302,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So it's going to be very different from tissue to tissue.

116
0:04:48.416,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Now, bone is somewhere in between,

117
0:04:51.216,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and this is one of the tissues that we work on a lot in our lab.

118
0:04:54.116,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And bone is actually quite good at repairing.

119
0:04:56.1,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It has to be. We've probably all had fractures

120
0:04:58.113,000 --> 0:04:59,000
at some point or other.

121
0:04:59.925,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And one of the ways that you can think

122
0:05:02.082,000 --> 0:05:03,000
about repairing your fracture

123
0:05:03.771,000 --> 0:05:05,000
is this procedure here, called an iliac crest harvest.

124
0:05:06.598,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And what the surgeon might do

125
0:05:08.264,000 --> 0:05:11,000
is take some bone from your iliac crest,

126
0:05:11.459,000 --> 0:05:12,000
which is just here,

127
0:05:12.837,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and then transplant that somewhere else in the body.

128
0:05:15.361,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And it actually works really well,

129
0:05:16.961,000 --> 0:05:17,000
because it's your own bone,

130
0:05:18.46,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and it's well vascularized,

131
0:05:19.694,000 --> 0:05:21,000
which means it's got a really good blood supply.

132
0:05:22.063,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But the problem is, there's only so much you can take,

133
0:05:24.846,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and also when you do that operation,

134
0:05:27.769,000 --> 0:05:29,000
your patients might actually have significant pain

135
0:05:30.308,000 --> 0:05:33,000
in that defect site even two years after the operation.

136
0:05:33.549,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So what we were thinking is,

137
0:05:35.435,000 --> 0:05:38,000
there's a tremendous need for bone repair, of course,

138
0:05:38.584,000 --> 0:05:4,000
but this iliac crest-type approach

139
0:05:41.071,000 --> 0:05:43,000
really has a lot of limitations to it,

140
0:05:43.503,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and could we perhaps recreate

141
0:05:45.737,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the generation of bone within the body

142
0:05:47.906,000 --> 0:05:5,000
on demand and then be able to transplant it

143
0:05:51.221,000 --> 0:05:55,000
without these very, very painful aftereffects

144
0:05:56.126,000 --> 0:05:59,000
that you would have with the iliac crest harvest?

145
0:05:59.809,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And so this is what we did, and the way we did it

146
0:06:02.471,000 --> 0:06:05,000
was by coming back to this typical tissue-engineering approach

147
0:06:05.809,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but actually thinking about it rather differently.

148
0:06:08.196,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And we simplified it a lot,

149
0:06:10.115,000 --> 0:06:12,000
so we got rid of a lot of these steps.

150
0:06:12.166,000 --> 0:06:14,000
We got rid of the need to harvest cells from the patient,

151
0:06:14.54,000 --> 0:06:16,000
we got rid of the need to put in really fancy chemistries,

152
0:06:17.457,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and we got rid of the need

153
0:06:19.149,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to culture these scaffolds in the lab.

154
0:06:21.977,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And what we really focused on

155
0:06:24.156,000 --> 0:06:27,000
was our material system and making it quite simple,

156
0:06:27.905,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but because we used it in a really clever way,

157
0:06:30.23,000 --> 0:06:32,000
we were able to generate enormous amounts of bone

158
0:06:32.877,000 --> 0:06:33,000
using this approach.

159
0:06:34.523,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So we were using the body

160
0:06:36.276,000 --> 0:06:38,000
as really the catalyst to help us

161
0:06:38.396,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to make lots of new bone.

162
0:06:40.939,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And it's an approach that we call

163
0:06:42.522,000 --> 0:06:44,000
the in vivo bioreactor, and we were able to make

164
0:06:45.333,000 --> 0:06:47,000
enormous amounts of bone using this approach.

165
0:06:47.819,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And I'll talk you through this.

166
0:06:49.058,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So what we do is,

167
0:06:51.538,000 --> 0:06:53,000
in humans, we all have a layer of stem cells

168
0:06:53.881,000 --> 0:06:54,000
on the outside of our long bones.

169
0:06:55.769,000 --> 0:06:56,000
That layer is called the periosteum.

170
0:06:57.472,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And that layer is actually normally

171
0:06:59.76,000 --> 0:07:01,000
very, very tightly bound to the underlying bone,

172
0:07:02.409,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and it's got stem cells in it.

173
0:07:03.841,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Those stem cells are really important

174
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
in the embryo when it develops,

175
0:07:07.069,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and they also sort of wake up if you have a fracture

176
0:07:09.311,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to help you with repairing the bone.

177
0:07:12.172,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So we take that periosteum layer

178
0:07:14.265,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and we developed a way to inject underneath it

179
0:07:17.255,000 --> 0:07:19,000
a liquid that then, within 30 seconds,

180
0:07:20.071,000 --> 0:07:21,000
would turn into quite a rigid gel

181
0:07:21.816,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and can actually lift the periosteum away from the bone.

182
0:07:25.069,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So it creates, in essence, an artificial cavity

183
0:07:28.757,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that is right next to both the bone

184
0:07:32.304,000 --> 0:07:35,000
but also this really rich layer of stem cells.

185
0:07:36.005,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And we go in through a pinhole incision

186
0:07:37.617,000 --> 0:07:39,000
so that no other cells from the body can get in,

187
0:07:40.57,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and what happens is that that artificial in vivo bioreactor cavity

188
0:07:45.362,000 --> 0:07:47,000
can then lead to the proliferation of these stem cells,

189
0:07:48.038,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and they can form lots of new tissue,

190
0:07:50.124,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and then over time, you can harvest that tissue

191
0:07:52.442,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and use it elsewhere in the body.

192
0:07:55.39,000 --> 0:07:57,000
This is a histology slide

193
0:07:57.534,000 --> 0:07:59,000
of what we see when we do that,

194
0:07:59.704,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and essentially what we see

195
0:08:02.221,000 --> 0:08:03,000
is very large amounts of bone.

196
0:08:03.855,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So in this picture, you can see the middle of the leg,

197
0:08:06.335,000 --> 0:08:07,000
so the bone marrow,

198
0:08:07.836,000 --> 0:08:08,000
then you can see the original bone,

199
0:08:09.64,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and you can see where that original bone finishes,

200
0:08:12.496,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and just to the left of that is the new bone

201
0:08:15.007,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that's grown within that bioreactor cavity,

202
0:08:17.044,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and you can actually make it even larger.

203
0:08:19.475,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And that demarcation that you can see

204
0:08:22.102,000 --> 0:08:24,000
between the original bone and the new bone

205
0:08:24.453,000 --> 0:08:26,000
acts as a very slight point of weakness,

206
0:08:26.466,000 --> 0:08:28,000
so actually now the surgeon can come along,

207
0:08:28.6,000 --> 0:08:3,000
can harvest away that new bone,

208
0:08:30.624,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and the periosteum can grow back,

209
0:08:32.827,000 --> 0:08:33,000
so you're left with the leg

210
0:08:34.696,000 --> 0:08:35,000
in the same sort of state

211
0:08:36.246,000 --> 0:08:38,000
as if you hadn't operated on it in the first place.

212
0:08:38.248,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So it's very, very low in terms of after-pain

213
0:08:42.097,000 --> 0:08:45,000
compared to an iliac crest harvest.

214
0:08:45.952,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And you can grow different amounts of bone

215
0:08:48.056,000 --> 0:08:5,000
depending on how much gel you put in there,

216
0:08:50.075,000 --> 0:08:53,000
so it really is an on demand sort of procedure.

217
0:08:53.277,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Now, at the time that we did this,

218
0:08:55.479,000 --> 0:08:58,000
this received a lot of attention in the press,

219
0:08:58.816,000 --> 0:09:,000
because it was a really nice way

220
0:09:01.247,000 --> 0:09:02,000
of generating new bone,

221
0:09:02.713,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and we got many, many contacts

222
0:09:04.708,000 --> 0:09:06,000
from different people that were interested in using this.

223
0:09:07.326,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And I'm just going to tell you,

224
0:09:09.115,000 --> 0:09:11,000
sometimes those contacts are very strange,

225
0:09:12.068,000 --> 0:09:13,000
slightly unexpected,

226
0:09:13.928,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and the very most interesting,

227
0:09:16.99,000 --> 0:09:18,000
let me put it that way, contact that I had,

228
0:09:19.275,000 --> 0:09:22,000
was actually from a team of American footballers

229
0:09:22.486,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that all wanted to have double-thickness skulls

230
0:09:25.866,000 --> 0:09:29,000
made on their head.

231
0:09:30.156,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And so you do get these kinds of contacts,

232
0:09:32.88,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and of course, being British

233
0:09:35.497,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and also growing up in France,

234
0:09:37.251,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I tend to be very blunt,

235
0:09:39.393,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and so I had to explain to them very nicely

236
0:09:41.434,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that in their particular case,

237
0:09:42.909,000 --> 0:09:44,000
there probably wasn't that much in there

238
0:09:44.923,000 --> 0:09:46,000
to protect in the first place.

239
0:09:47.911,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Laughter)

240
0:09:49.481,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Applause)

241
0:09:50.734,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So this was our approach,

242
0:09:52.589,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and it was simple materials,

243
0:09:54.233,000 --> 0:09:55,000
but we thought about it carefully.

244
0:09:56.22,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And actually we know that those cells

245
0:09:57.84,000 --> 0:09:59,000
in the body, in the embryo, as they develop

246
0:09:59.978,000 --> 0:10:02,000
can form a different kind of tissue, cartilage,

247
0:10:03.207,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and so we developed a gel that was slightly different

248
0:10:05.762,000 --> 0:10:07,000
in nature and slightly different chemistry,

249
0:10:08.181,000 --> 0:10:1,000
put it in there, and we were able to get

250
0:10:10.328,000 --> 0:10:12,000
100 percent cartilage instead.

251
0:10:12.506,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And this approach works really well, I think,

252
0:10:14.514,000 --> 0:10:16,000
for pre-planned procedures,

253
0:10:16.996,000 --> 0:10:18,000
but it's something you do have to pre-plan.

254
0:10:19.868,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So for other kinds of operations,

255
0:10:22.136,000 --> 0:10:23,000
there's definitely a need for other

256
0:10:23.833,000 --> 0:10:25,000
scaffold-based approaches.

257
0:10:26.336,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And when you think about designing

258
0:10:28.705,000 --> 0:10:29,000
those other scaffolds, actually,

259
0:10:30.343,000 --> 0:10:31,000
you need a really multi-disciplinary team.

260
0:10:32.314,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And so our team has chemists,

261
0:10:34.379,000 --> 0:10:37,000
it has cell biologists, surgeons, physicists even,

262
0:10:37.756,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and those people all come together

263
0:10:39.786,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and we think really hard about designing the materials.

264
0:10:42.197,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But we want to make them have enough information

265
0:10:45.163,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that we can get the cells to do what we want,

266
0:10:47.317,000 --> 0:10:49,000
but not be so complex as to make it difficult

267
0:10:49.694,000 --> 0:10:5,000
to get to clinic.

268
0:10:51.437,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And so one of the things we think about a lot

269
0:10:54.188,000 --> 0:10:55,000
is really trying to understand

270
0:10:55.983,000 --> 0:10:57,000
the structure of the tissues in the body.

271
0:10:58.36,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And so if we think of bone,

272
0:11:00.02,000 --> 0:11:02,000
obviously my own favorite tissue,

273
0:11:02.644,000 --> 0:11:03,000
we zoom in, we can see,

274
0:11:04.201,000 --> 0:11:05,000
even if you don't know anything about bone structure,

275
0:11:06.083,000 --> 0:11:08,000
it's beautifully organized, really beautifully organized.

276
0:11:08.628,000 --> 0:11:09,000
We've lots of blood vessels in there.

277
0:11:10.515,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And if we zoom in again, we see that the cells

278
0:11:12.854,000 --> 0:11:14,000
are actually surrounded by a 3D matrix

279
0:11:15.826,000 --> 0:11:17,000
of nano-scale fibers, and they give a lot

280
0:11:17.997,000 --> 0:11:19,000
of information to the cells.

281
0:11:20.179,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And if we zoom in again,

282
0:11:21.793,000 --> 0:11:23,000
actually in the case of bone, the matrix

283
0:11:23.994,000 --> 0:11:25,000
around the cells is beautifully organized

284
0:11:26.145,000 --> 0:11:28,000
at the nano scale, and it's a hybrid material

285
0:11:28.612,000 --> 0:11:3,000
that's part organic, part inorganic.

286
0:11:31.196,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And that's led to a whole field, really,

287
0:11:33.268,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that has looked at developing materials

288
0:11:35.659,000 --> 0:11:37,000
that have this hybrid kind of structure.

289
0:11:38.407,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And so I'm showing here just two examples

290
0:11:41.685,000 --> 0:11:44,000
where we've made some materials that have that sort of structure,

291
0:11:44.805,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and you can really tailor it.

292
0:11:46.243,000 --> 0:11:48,000
You can see here a very squishy one

293
0:11:48.307,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and now a material that's also this hybrid sort of material

294
0:11:52.406,000 --> 0:11:53,000
but actually has remarkable toughness,

295
0:11:54.369,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and it's no longer brittle.

296
0:11:55.829,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And an inorganic material would normally be really brittle,

297
0:11:58.285,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and you wouldn't be able to have

298
0:11:59.725,000 --> 0:12:01,000
that sort of strength and toughness in it.

299
0:12:01.913,000 --> 0:12:03,000
One other thing I want to quickly mention is that

300
0:12:04.402,000 --> 0:12:06,000
many of the scaffolds we make are porous, and they have to be,

301
0:12:07.117,000 --> 0:12:09,000
because you want blood vessels to grow in there.

302
0:12:09.22,000 --> 0:12:1,000
But the pores are actually oftentimes

303
0:12:11.097,000 --> 0:12:12,000
much bigger than the cells,

304
0:12:12.39,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and so even though it's 3D,

305
0:12:14.101,000 --> 0:12:17,000
the cell might see it more as a slightly curved surface,

306
0:12:17.456,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and that's a little bit unnatural.

307
0:12:19.132,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And so one of the things you can think about doing

308
0:12:21.38,000 --> 0:12:24,000
is actually making scaffolds with slightly different dimensions

309
0:12:24.528,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that might be able to surround your cells in 3D

310
0:12:27.321,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and give them a little bit more information.

311
0:12:29.89,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And there's a lot of work going on in both of these areas.

312
0:12:33.471,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Now finally, I just want to talk a little bit about

313
0:12:37.44,000 --> 0:12:39,000
applying this sort of thing to cardiovascular disease,

314
0:12:40.148,000 --> 0:12:43,000
because this is a really big clinical problem.

315
0:12:43.411,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And one of the things that we know is that,

316
0:12:46.996,000 --> 0:12:48,000
unfortunately, if you have a heart attack,

317
0:12:49.235,000 --> 0:12:51,000
then that tissue can start to die,

318
0:12:52.137,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and your outcome may not be very good over time.

319
0:12:55.888,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And it would be really great, actually,

320
0:12:57.598,000 --> 0:12:58,000
if we could stop that dead tissue

321
0:12:59.517,000 --> 0:13:02,000
either from dying or help it to regenerate.

322
0:13:03.502,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And there's lots and lots of stem cell trials going on worldwide,

323
0:13:06.75,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and they use many different types of cells,

324
0:13:08.822,000 --> 0:13:1,000
but one common theme that seems to be coming out

325
0:13:11.174,000 --> 0:13:13,000
is that actually, very often, those cells will die

326
0:13:14.173,000 --> 0:13:15,000
once you've implanted them.

327
0:13:15.968,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And you can either put them into the heart

328
0:13:17.843,000 --> 0:13:19,000
or into the blood system,

329
0:13:19.863,000 --> 0:13:21,000
but either way, we don't seem to be able

330
0:13:22.225,000 --> 0:13:23,000
to get quite the right number of cells

331
0:13:24.092,000 --> 0:13:26,000
getting to the location we want them to

332
0:13:26.334,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and being able to deliver the sort of beautiful

333
0:13:30.828,000 --> 0:13:32,000
cell regeneration that we would like to have

334
0:13:33.568,000 --> 0:13:36,000
to get good clinical outcomes.

335
0:13:36.985,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And so some of the things that we're thinking of,

336
0:13:38.968,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and many other people in the field are thinking of,

337
0:13:42.089,000 --> 0:13:45,000
are actually developing materials for that.

338
0:13:45.095,000 --> 0:13:46,000
But there's a difference here.

339
0:13:46.714,000 --> 0:13:48,000
We still need chemistry, we still need mechanics,

340
0:13:48.924,000 --> 0:13:5,000
we still need really interesting topography,

341
0:13:51.595,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and we still need really interesting ways to surround the cells.

342
0:13:54.243,000 --> 0:13:56,000
But now, the cells also

343
0:13:56.754,000 --> 0:13:58,000
would probably quite like a material

344
0:13:58.779,000 --> 0:14:,000
that's going to be able to be conductive,

345
0:14:00.797,000 --> 0:14:04,000
because the cells themselves will respond very well

346
0:14:05.006,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and will actually conduct signals between themselves.

347
0:14:08.485,000 --> 0:14:09,000
You can see them now

348
0:14:10.001,000 --> 0:14:12,000
beating synchronously on these materials,

349
0:14:12.476,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and that's a very, very exciting development

350
0:14:15.255,000 --> 0:14:17,000
that's going on.

351
0:14:17.369,000 --> 0:14:21,000
So just to wrap up, I'd like to actually say that

352
0:14:22.193,000 --> 0:14:24,000
being able to work in this sort of field,

353
0:14:24.549,000 --> 0:14:25,000
all of us that work in this field

354
0:14:26.203,000 --> 0:14:28,000
that's not only super-exciting science,

355
0:14:28.712,000 --> 0:14:3,000
but also has the potential

356
0:14:30.758,000 --> 0:14:31,000
to impact on patients,

357
0:14:32.726,000 --> 0:14:34,000
however big or small they are,

358
0:14:35.156,000 --> 0:14:36,000
is really a great privilege.

359
0:14:36.709,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And so for that, I'd like to thank all of you as well.

360
0:14:39.853,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Thank you.

361
0:14:41.17,000 --> 0:14:45,000
(Applause)

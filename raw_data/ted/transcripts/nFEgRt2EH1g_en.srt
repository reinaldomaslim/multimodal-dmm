2
0:00:13.08,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Space, the final frontier.

3
0:00:17.88,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I first heard these words when I was just six years old,

4
0:00:21.36,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and I was completely inspired.

5
0:00:23.64,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I wanted to explore strange new worlds.

6
0:00:26.04,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I wanted to seek out new life.

7
0:00:27.56,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I wanted to see everything that the universe had to offer.

8
0:00:31.84,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And those dreams, those words, they took me on a journey,

9
0:00:35.56,000 --> 0:00:36,000
a journey of discovery,

10
0:00:37.04,000 --> 0:00:39,000
through school, through university,

11
0:00:39.24,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to do a PhD and finally to become a professional astronomer.

12
0:00:43.92,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Now, I learned two amazing things,

13
0:00:46.96,000 --> 0:00:47,000
one slightly unfortunate,

14
0:00:48.52,000 --> 0:00:5,000
when I was doing my PhD.

15
0:00:50.6,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I learned that the reality was

16
0:00:53.04,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I wouldn't be piloting a starship anytime soon.

17
0:00:57.44,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But I also learned that the universe is strange, wonderful and vast,

18
0:01:02.08,000 --> 0:01:04,000
actually too vast to be explored by spaceship.

19
0:01:05.72,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And so I turned my attention to astronomy, to using telescopes.

20
0:01:09.84,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Now, I show you before you an image of the night sky.

21
0:01:12.64,000 --> 0:01:13,000
You might see it anywhere in the world.

22
0:01:15.04,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And all of these stars are part of our local galaxy, the Milky Way.

23
0:01:19.56,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Now, if you were to go to a darker part of the sky,

24
0:01:22.28,000 --> 0:01:24,000
a nice dark site, perhaps in the desert,

25
0:01:24.84,000 --> 0:01:26,000
you might see the center of our Milky Way galaxy

26
0:01:27.28,000 --> 0:01:29,000
spread out before you, hundreds of billions of stars.

27
0:01:30.84,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And it's a very beautiful image.

28
0:01:32.44,000 --> 0:01:33,000
It's colorful.

29
0:01:33.8,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And again, this is just a local corner of our universe.

30
0:01:37.44,000 --> 0:01:4,000
You can see there's a sort of strange dark dust across it.

31
0:01:40.76,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Now, that is local dust

32
0:01:42.76,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that's obscuring the light of the stars.

33
0:01:45.44,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But we can do a pretty good job.

34
0:01:47.04,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Just with our own eyes, we can explore our little corner of the universe.

35
0:01:50.52,000 --> 0:01:51,000
It's possible to do better.

36
0:01:51.88,000 --> 0:01:54,000
You can use wonderful telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope.

37
0:01:56.2,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Now, astronomers have put together this image.

38
0:01:58.4,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It's called the Hubble Deep Field,

39
0:02:00.32,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and they've spent hundreds of hours observing just a tiny patch of the sky

40
0:02:04.68,000 --> 0:02:06,000
no larger than your thumbnail held at arm's length.

41
0:02:07.52,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And in this image

42
0:02:08.8,000 --> 0:02:09,000
you can see thousands of galaxies,

43
0:02:10.48,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and we know that there must be hundreds of millions, billions of galaxies

44
0:02:13.96,000 --> 0:02:14,000
in the entire universe,

45
0:02:15.36,000 --> 0:02:17,000
some like our own and some very different.

46
0:02:18.04,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So you think, OK, well, I can continue this journey.

47
0:02:20.72,000 --> 0:02:22,000
This is easy. I can just use a very powerful telescope

48
0:02:23.44,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and just look at the sky, no problem.

49
0:02:25.96,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It's actually really missing out if we just do that.

50
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Now, that's because everything I've talked about so far

51
0:02:32.76,000 --> 0:02:35,000
is just using the visible spectrum, just the thing that your eyes can see,

52
0:02:36.68,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and that's a tiny slice,

53
0:02:38.12,000 --> 0:02:41,000
a tiny, tiny slice of what the universe has to offer us.

54
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Now, there's also two very important problems with using visible light.

55
0:02:46.92,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Not only are we missing out on all the other processes

56
0:02:49.68,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that are emitting other kinds of light,

57
0:02:52.88,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but there's two issues.

58
0:02:54.32,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Now, the first is that dust that I mentioned earlier.

59
0:02:57.72,000 --> 0:02:59,000
The dust stops the visible light from getting to us.

60
0:03:00.68,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So as we look deeper into the universe, we see less light.

61
0:03:05.4,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The dust stops it getting to us.

62
0:03:07.52,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But there's a really strange problem with using visible light

63
0:03:10.96,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in order to try and explore the universe.

64
0:03:13.64,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Now take a break for a minute.

65
0:03:15.92,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Say you're standing on a corner, a busy street corner.

66
0:03:19.08,000 --> 0:03:2,000
There's cars going by.

67
0:03:20.6,000 --> 0:03:21,000
An ambulance approaches.

68
0:03:22.84,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It has a high-pitched siren.

69
0:03:24.24,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Imitates a siren passing by)

70
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:3,000
The siren appeared to change in pitch

71
0:03:30.36,000 --> 0:03:32,000
as it moved towards and away from you.

72
0:03:32.96,000 --> 0:03:35,000
The ambulance driver did not change the siren just to mess with you.

73
0:03:38.04,000 --> 0:03:4,000
That was a product of your perception.

74
0:03:40.64,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The sound waves, as the ambulance approached,

75
0:03:43.4,000 --> 0:03:44,000
were compressed,

76
0:03:44.64,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and they changed higher in pitch.

77
0:03:46.6,000 --> 0:03:48,000
As the ambulance receded, the sound waves were stretched,

78
0:03:49.4,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and they sounded lower in pitch.

79
0:03:51.48,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The same thing happens with light.

80
0:03:54.04,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Objects moving towards us,

81
0:03:56.44,000 --> 0:03:59,000
their light waves are compressed and they appear bluer.

82
0:03:59.64,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Objects moving away from us,

83
0:04:01.88,000 --> 0:04:03,000
their light waves are stretched, and they appear redder.

84
0:04:04.56,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So we call these effects blueshift and redshift.

85
0:04:08.44,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Now, our universe is expanding,

86
0:04:11.4,000 --> 0:04:15,000
so everything is moving away from everything else,

87
0:04:15.6,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and that means everything appears to be red.

88
0:04:19.04,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And oddly enough, as you look more deeply into the universe,

89
0:04:22.8,000 --> 0:04:26,000
more distant objects are moving away further and faster,

90
0:04:27.12,000 --> 0:04:28,000
so they appear more red.

91
0:04:29.56,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So if I come back to the Hubble Deep Field

92
0:04:32.519,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and we were to continue to peer deeply into the universe

93
0:04:35.24,000 --> 0:04:36,000
just using the Hubble,

94
0:04:36.8,000 --> 0:04:38,000
as we get to a certain distance away,

95
0:04:39.52,000 --> 0:04:4,000
everything becomes red,

96
0:04:41.92,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and that presents something of a problem.

97
0:04:43.92,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Eventually, we get so far away

98
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:48,000
everything is shifted into the infrared

99
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and we can't see anything at all.

100
0:04:51.68,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So there must be a way around this.

101
0:04:53.4,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Otherwise, I'm limited in my journey.

102
0:04:55.24,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I wanted to explore the whole universe,

103
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
not just whatever I can see, you know, before the redshift kicks in.

104
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
There is a technique.

105
0:05:03.44,000 --> 0:05:04,000
It's called radio astronomy.

106
0:05:04.84,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Astronomers have been using this for decades.

107
0:05:07.2,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It's a fantastic technique.

108
0:05:08.52,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I show you the Parkes Radio Telescope, affectionately known as "The Dish."

109
0:05:12.04,000 --> 0:05:13,000
You may have seen the movie.

110
0:05:13.84,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And radio is really brilliant.

111
0:05:15.44,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It allows us to peer much more deeply.

112
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:2,000
It doesn't get stopped by dust,

113
0:05:20.72,000 --> 0:05:22,000
so you can see everything in the universe,

114
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and redshift is less of a problem

115
0:05:24.88,000 --> 0:05:27,000
because we can build receivers that receive across a large band.

116
0:05:28.6,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So what does Parkes see when we turn it to the center of the Milky Way?

117
0:05:32.56,000 --> 0:05:33,000
We should see something fantastic, right?

118
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Well, we do see something interesting.

119
0:05:38.08,000 --> 0:05:39,000
All that dust has gone.

120
0:05:39.76,000 --> 0:05:42,000
As I mentioned, radio goes straight through dust, so not a problem.

121
0:05:43.84,000 --> 0:05:44,000
But the view is very different.

122
0:05:45.76,000 --> 0:05:48,000
We can see that the center of the Milky Way is aglow,

123
0:05:49.6,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and this isn't starlight.

124
0:05:51.96,000 --> 0:05:54,000
This is a light called synchrotron radiation,

125
0:05:55.12,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and it's formed from electrons spiraling around cosmic magnetic fields.

126
0:06:00.28,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So the plane is aglow with this light.

127
0:06:03.4,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And we can also see strange tufts coming off of it,

128
0:06:06.72,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and objects which don't appear to line up

129
0:06:09.24,000 --> 0:06:11,000
with anything that we can see with our own eyes.

130
0:06:12.52,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But it's hard to really interpret this image,

131
0:06:14.68,000 --> 0:06:16,000
because as you can see, it's very low resolution.

132
0:06:17.48,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Radio waves have a wavelength that's long,

133
0:06:19.68,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and that makes their resolution poorer.

134
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:24,000
This image is also black and white,

135
0:06:24.08,000 --> 0:06:27,000
so we don't really know what is the color of everything in here.

136
0:06:28.64,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Well, fast-forward to today.

137
0:06:30.04,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We can build telescopes

138
0:06:31.52,000 --> 0:06:33,000
which can get over these problems.

139
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Now, I'm showing you here an image of the Murchison Radio Observatory,

140
0:06:37.52,000 --> 0:06:39,000
a fantastic place to build radio telescopes.

141
0:06:40.32,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It's flat, it's dry,

142
0:06:42.64,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and most importantly, it's radio quiet:

143
0:06:45.64,000 --> 0:06:48,000
no mobile phones, no Wi-Fi, nothing,

144
0:06:48.76,000 --> 0:06:5,000
just very, very radio quiet,

145
0:06:51.28,000 --> 0:06:53,000
so a perfect place to build a radio telescope.

146
0:06:54.88,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Now, the telescope that I've been working on for a few years

147
0:06:57.76,000 --> 0:06:58,000
is called the Murchison Widefield Array,

148
0:06:59.72,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and I'm going to show you a little time lapse of it being built.

149
0:07:02.76,000 --> 0:07:05,000
This is a group of undergraduate and postgraduate students

150
0:07:06.04,000 --> 0:07:07,000
located in Perth.

151
0:07:07.32,000 --> 0:07:08,000
We call them the Student Army,

152
0:07:09.08,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and they volunteered their time to build a radio telescope.

153
0:07:11.92,000 --> 0:07:12,000
There's no course credit for this.

154
0:07:14.32,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And they're putting together these radio dipoles.

155
0:07:17.24,000 --> 0:07:21,000
They just receive at low frequencies, a bit like your FM radio or your TV.

156
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And here we are deploying them across the desert.

157
0:07:26.12,000 --> 0:07:28,000
The final telescope covers 10 square kilometers

158
0:07:28.56,000 --> 0:07:3,000
of the Western Australian desert.

159
0:07:30.72,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And the interesting thing is, there's no moving parts.

160
0:07:33.72,000 --> 0:07:35,000
We just deploy these little antennas

161
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:37,000
essentially on chicken mesh.

162
0:07:37.88,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It's fairly cheap.

163
0:07:39.32,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Cables take the signals

164
0:07:41.32,000 --> 0:07:43,000
from the antennas

165
0:07:43.4,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and bring them to central processing units.

166
0:07:45.96,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And it's the size of this telescope,

167
0:07:47.76,000 --> 0:07:49,000
the fact that we've built it over the entire desert

168
0:07:50.44,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that gives us a better resolution than Parkes.

169
0:07:53.88,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Now, eventually all those cables bring them to a unit

170
0:07:57.44,000 --> 0:08:,000
which sends it off to a supercomputer here in Perth,

171
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and that's where I come in.

172
0:08:03.32,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Sighs)

173
0:08:04.56,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Radio data.

174
0:08:05.8,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I have spent the last five years

175
0:08:07.64,000 --> 0:08:09,000
working with very difficult, very interesting data

176
0:08:10.52,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that no one had really looked at before.

177
0:08:12.52,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I've spent a long time calibrating it,

178
0:08:14.68,000 --> 0:08:17,000
running millions of CPU hours on supercomputers

179
0:08:18.6,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and really trying to understand that data.

180
0:08:21.36,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And with this telescope,

181
0:08:23.32,000 --> 0:08:24,000
with this data,

182
0:08:24.6,000 --> 0:08:27,000
we've performed a survey of the entire southern sky,

183
0:08:28.56,000 --> 0:08:33,000
the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA Survey,

184
0:08:33.68,000 --> 0:08:34,000
or GLEAM, as I call it.

185
0:08:36.44,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And I'm very excited.

186
0:08:37.92,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This survey is just about to be published, but it hasn't been shown yet,

187
0:08:41.325,000 --> 0:08:42,000
so you are literally the first people

188
0:08:43.28,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to see this southern survey of the entire sky.

189
0:08:46.799,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So I'm delighted to share with you some images from this survey.

190
0:08:50.88,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Now, imagine you went to the Murchison,

191
0:08:52.799,000 --> 0:08:54,000
you camped out underneath the stars

192
0:08:54.919,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and you looked towards the south.

193
0:08:56.56,000 --> 0:08:57,000
You saw the south's celestial pole,

194
0:08:58.251,000 --> 0:08:59,000
the galaxy rising.

195
0:08:59.48,000 --> 0:09:01,000
If I fade in the radio light,

196
0:09:02.12,000 --> 0:09:04,000
this is what we observe with our survey.

197
0:09:04.8,000 --> 0:09:07,000
You can see that the galactic plane is no longer dark with dust.

198
0:09:07.88,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It's alight with synchrotron radiation,

199
0:09:10.32,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and thousands of dots are in the sky.

200
0:09:12.84,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Our large Magellanic Cloud, our nearest galactic neighbor,

201
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
is orange instead of its more familiar blue-white.

202
0:09:19.4,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So there's a lot going on in this. Let's take a closer look.

203
0:09:22.8,000 --> 0:09:24,000
If we look back towards the galactic center,

204
0:09:25.24,000 --> 0:09:28,000
where we originally saw the Parkes image that I showed you earlier,

205
0:09:28.48,000 --> 0:09:3,000
low resolution, black and white,

206
0:09:30.88,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and we fade to the GLEAM view,

207
0:09:34.2,000 --> 0:09:37,000
you can see the resolution has gone up by a factor of a hundred.

208
0:09:38.08,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We now have a color view of the sky,

209
0:09:40.96,000 --> 0:09:41,000
a technicolor view.

210
0:09:42.32,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Now, it's not a false color view.

211
0:09:45.32,000 --> 0:09:47,000
These are real radio colors.

212
0:09:48.6,000 --> 0:09:5,000
What I've done is I've colored the lowest frequencies red

213
0:09:51.44,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and the highest frequencies blue,

214
0:09:53.08,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and the middle ones green.

215
0:09:54.68,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And that gives us this rainbow view.

216
0:09:56.92,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And this isn't just false color.

217
0:09:59.2,000 --> 0:10:01,000
The colors in this image tell us about the physical processes

218
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
going on in the universe.

219
0:10:03.974,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So for instance, if you look along the plane of the galaxy,

220
0:10:06.76,000 --> 0:10:07,000
it's alight with synchrotron,

221
0:10:08.24,000 --> 0:10:1,000
which is mostly reddish orange,

222
0:10:10.64,000 --> 0:10:13,000
but if we look very closely, we see little blue dots.

223
0:10:14.32,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Now, if we zoom in,

224
0:10:15.92,000 --> 0:10:17,000
these blue dots are ionized plasma

225
0:10:18.48,000 --> 0:10:19,000
around very bright stars,

226
0:10:20.68,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and what happens is that they block the red light,

227
0:10:23.48,000 --> 0:10:24,000
so they appear blue.

228
0:10:25.88,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And these can tell us about these star-forming regions

229
0:10:28.84,000 --> 0:10:29,000
in our galaxy.

230
0:10:30.12,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And we just see them immediately.

231
0:10:31.76,000 --> 0:10:34,000
We look at the galaxy, and the color tells us that they're there.

232
0:10:34.84,000 --> 0:10:35,000
You can see little soap bubbles,

233
0:10:36.44,000 --> 0:10:39,000
little circular images around the galactic plane,

234
0:10:39.88,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and these are supernova remnants.

235
0:10:42.6,000 --> 0:10:43,000
When a star explodes,

236
0:10:44.32,000 --> 0:10:46,000
its outer shell is cast off

237
0:10:46.8,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and it travels outward into space gathering up material,

238
0:10:50.12,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and it produces a little shell.

239
0:10:52.8,000 --> 0:10:55,000
It's been a long-standing mystery to astronomers

240
0:10:56.2,000 --> 0:10:58,000
where all the supernova remnants are.

241
0:10:58.96,000 --> 0:11:02,000
We know that there must be a lot of high-energy electrons in the plane

242
0:11:03.32,000 --> 0:11:05,000
to produce the synchrotron radiation that we see,

243
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and we think they're produced by supernova remnants,

244
0:11:08.6,000 --> 0:11:09,000
but there don't seem to be enough.

245
0:11:10.4,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Fortunately, GLEAM is really, really good at detecting supernova remnants,

246
0:11:14.32,000 --> 0:11:16,000
so we're hoping to have a new paper out on that soon.

247
0:11:17.8,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Now, that's fine.

248
0:11:19.08,000 --> 0:11:21,000
We've explored our little local universe,

249
0:11:21.44,000 --> 0:11:23,000
but I wanted to go deeper, I wanted to go further.

250
0:11:23.84,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I wanted to go beyond the Milky Way.

251
0:11:26.52,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Well, as it happens, we can see a very interesting object in the top right,

252
0:11:30.32,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and this is a local radio galaxy,

253
0:11:32.56,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Centaurus A.

254
0:11:34.24,000 --> 0:11:35,000
If we zoom in on this,

255
0:11:35.52,000 --> 0:11:38,000
we can see that there are two huge plumes going out into space.

256
0:11:39.6,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And if you look right in the center between those two plumes,

257
0:11:42.52,000 --> 0:11:44,000
you'll see a galaxy just like our own.

258
0:11:44.92,000 --> 0:11:46,000
It's a spiral. It has a dust lane.

259
0:11:47.4,000 --> 0:11:48,000
It's a normal galaxy.

260
0:11:49.04,000 --> 0:11:52,000
But these jets are only visible in the radio.

261
0:11:52.68,000 --> 0:11:55,000
If we looked in the visible, we wouldn't even know they were there,

262
0:11:55.88,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and they're thousands of times larger than the host galaxy.

263
0:11:59.48,000 --> 0:12:01,000
What's going on? What's producing these jets?

264
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
At the center of every galaxy that we know about

265
0:12:06.72,000 --> 0:12:08,000
is a supermassive black hole.

266
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Now, black holes are invisible. That's why they're called that.

267
0:12:12.44,000 --> 0:12:15,000
All you can see is the deflection of the light around them,

268
0:12:15.48,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and occasionally, when a star or a cloud of gas comes into their orbit,

269
0:12:19.8,000 --> 0:12:21,000
it is ripped apart by tidal forces,

270
0:12:22.56,000 --> 0:12:24,000
forming what we call an accretion disk.

271
0:12:25.64,000 --> 0:12:28,000
The accretion disk glows brightly in the x-rays,

272
0:12:28.88,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and huge magnetic fields can launch the material into space

273
0:12:33.32,000 --> 0:12:34,000
at nearly the speed of light.

274
0:12:35.52,000 --> 0:12:38,000
So these jets are visible in the radio

275
0:12:39.24,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and this is what we pick up in our survey.

276
0:12:42.04,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Well, very well, so we've seen one radio galaxy. That's nice.

277
0:12:46.08,000 --> 0:12:48,000
But if you just look at the top of that image,

278
0:12:48.28,000 --> 0:12:49,000
you'll see another radio galaxy.

279
0:12:50.04,000 --> 0:12:53,000
It's a little bit smaller, and that's just because it's further away.

280
0:12:53.8,000 --> 0:12:55,000
OK. Two radio galaxies.

281
0:12:56.48,000 --> 0:12:57,000
We can see this. This is fine.

282
0:12:58.08,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Well, what about all the other dots?

283
0:12:59.84,000 --> 0:13:,000
Presumably those are just stars.

284
0:13:01.88,000 --> 0:13:02,000
They're not.

285
0:13:03.12,000 --> 0:13:04,000
They're all radio galaxies.

286
0:13:05.32,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Every single one of the dots in this image

287
0:13:08.24,000 --> 0:13:09,000
is a distant galaxy,

288
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:12,000
millions to billions of light-years away

289
0:13:12.88,000 --> 0:13:14,000
with a supermassive black hole at its center

290
0:13:15.52,000 --> 0:13:18,000
pushing material into space at nearly the speed of light.

291
0:13:19.12,000 --> 0:13:2,000
It is mind-blowing.

292
0:13:21.68,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And this survey is even larger than what I've shown here.

293
0:13:25.44,000 --> 0:13:27,000
If we zoom out to the full extent of the survey,

294
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:32,000
you can see I found 300,000 of these radio galaxies.

295
0:13:32.12,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So it's truly an epic journey.

296
0:13:35.04,000 --> 0:13:37,000
We've discovered all of these galaxies

297
0:13:37.72,000 --> 0:13:4,000
right back to the very first supermassive black holes.

298
0:13:41.96,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I'm very proud of this, and it will be published next week.

299
0:13:45.28,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Now, that's not all.

300
0:13:48.12,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I've explored the furthest reaches of the galaxy with this survey,

301
0:13:52.48,000 --> 0:13:54,000
but there's something even more in this image.

302
0:13:56.32,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Now, I'll take you right back to the dawn of time.

303
0:13:59.64,000 --> 0:14:02,000
When the universe formed, it was a big bang,

304
0:14:03.32,000 --> 0:14:07,000
which left the universe as a sea of hydrogen,

305
0:14:07.4,000 --> 0:14:08,000
neutral hydrogen.

306
0:14:08.92,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And when the very first stars and galaxies switched on,

307
0:14:11.72,000 --> 0:14:13,000
they ionized that hydrogen.

308
0:14:13.84,000 --> 0:14:16,000
So the universe went from neutral to ionized.

309
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
That imprinted a signal all around us.

310
0:14:21.36,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Everywhere, it pervades us,

311
0:14:23.12,000 --> 0:14:24,000
like the Force.

312
0:14:24.56,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Now, because that happened so long ago,

313
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:3,000
the signal was redshifted,

314
0:14:31.56,000 --> 0:14:34,000
so now that signal is at very low frequencies.

315
0:14:34.88,000 --> 0:14:36,000
It's at the same frequency as my survey,

316
0:14:37.36,000 --> 0:14:38,000
but it's so faint.

317
0:14:38.76,000 --> 0:14:41,000
It's a billionth the size of any of the objects in my survey.

318
0:14:43.32,000 --> 0:14:47,000
So our telescope may not be quite sensitive enough to pick up this signal.

319
0:14:48.24,000 --> 0:14:5,000
However, there's a new radio telescope.

320
0:14:50.76,000 --> 0:14:51,000
So I can't have a starship,

321
0:14:52.44,000 --> 0:14:53,000
but I can hopefully have

322
0:14:53.72,000 --> 0:14:55,000
one of the biggest radio telescopes in the world.

323
0:14:56.6,000 --> 0:14:59,000
We're building the Square Kilometre Array, a new radio telescope,

324
0:15:00.24,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and it's going to be a thousand times bigger than the MWA,

325
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:06,000
a thousand times more sensitive, and have an even better resolution.

326
0:15:06.24,000 --> 0:15:08,000
So we should find tens of millions of galaxies.

327
0:15:08.48,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And perhaps, deep in that signal,

328
0:15:10.84,000 --> 0:15:14,000
I will get to look upon the very first stars and galaxies switching on,

329
0:15:15.04,000 --> 0:15:17,000
the beginning of time itself.

330
0:15:17.92,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Thank you.

331
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
From all outward appearances,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
John had everything going for him.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
He had just signed the contract

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
to sell his New York apartment

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
at a six-figure profit,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and he'd only owned it for five years.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
The school where he graduated from with his master's

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
had just offered him a teaching appointment,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
which meant not only a salary,

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but benefits for the first time in ages.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And yet, despite everything going really well for John,

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
he was struggling,

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
fighting addiction and a gripping depression.

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
On the night of June 11th, 2003,

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
he climbed up to the edge

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
of the fence on the Manhattan Bridge

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and he leaped to the treacherous waters below.

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Remarkably --

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
no, miraculously --

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
he lived.

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The fall shattered his right arm,

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
broke every rib that he had,

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
punctured his lung,

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and he drifted in and out of consciousness

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
as he drifted down the East River,

26
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
under the Brooklyn Bridge

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and out into the pathway of the Staten Island Ferry,

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
where passengers on the ferry

29
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
heard his cries of pain,

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
contacted the boat's captain

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
who contacted the Coast Guard

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
who fished him out of the East River

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and took him to Bellevue Hospital.

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And that's actually where our story begins.

35
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Because once John committed himself

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to putting his life back together --

37
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
first physically, then emotionally,

38
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and then spiritually --

39
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
he found that there were very few resources available

40
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to someone who has attempted to end their life

41
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
in the way that he did.

42
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Research shows

43
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that 19 out of 20 people

44
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
who attempt suicide

45
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
will fail.

46
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But the people who fail

47
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
are 37 times more likely to succeed

48
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the second time.

49
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
This truly is

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
an at-risk population

51
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
with very few resources to support them.

52
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And what happens

53
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
when people try to assemble themselves back into life,

54
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
because of our taboos around suicide,

55
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
we're not sure what to say,

56
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and so quite often we say nothing.

57
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And that furthers the isolation

58
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that people like John found themselves in.

59
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I know John's story very well

60
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
because I'm John.

61
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And this is, today,

62
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
the first time in any sort of public setting

63
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I've ever acknowledged

64
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
the journey that I have been on.

65
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006

66
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and a good friend last year to suicide,

67
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and sitting last year at TEDActive,

68
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I knew that I needed to step out of my silence

69
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and past my taboos

70
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to talk about an idea worth spreading --

71
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and that is that people

72
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
who have made the difficult choice

73
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to come back to life

74
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
need more resources and need our help.

75
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
As the Trevor Project says, it gets better.

76
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It gets way better.

77
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And I'm choosing to come out

78
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
of a totally different kind of closet today

79
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
to encourage you, to urge you,

80
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that if you are someone

81
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
who has contemplated or attempted suicide,

82
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
or you know somebody who has,

83
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
talk about it; get help.

84
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It's a conversation worth having

85
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and an idea worth spreading.

86
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Thank you.

87
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:29,000
As you pointed out, every time you come here, you learn something.

2
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:31,000
This morning, the world's experts

3
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:35,000
from I guess three or four different companies on building seats,

4
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I think concluded that ultimately, the solution is, people shouldn't sit down.

5
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I could have told them that.

6
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Yesterday, the automotive guys gave us some new insights.

8
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:56,000
They pointed out that, I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today,

9
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:59,000
they will be steering cars by wire,

10
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:01,000
without all that mechanical stuff.

11
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:03,000
(Laughter)

12
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:05,000
That's reassuring.

13
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Applause)

14
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:14,000
They then pointed out that there'd be, sort of, the other controls by wire,

15
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to get rid of all that mechanical stuff.

16
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
That's pretty good, but why not get rid of the wires?

17
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Then you don't need anything to control the car, except thinking about it.

18
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I would love to talk about the technology,

19
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and sometime, in what's past the 15 minutes,

20
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I'll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here

21
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:39,000
about what's in here.

22
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first,

23
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:5,000
it would be that from the time we started building this,

24
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the big idea wasn't the technology.

25
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it

26
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:58,000
in the iBOT for the disabled community.

27
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:04,000
The big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution

28
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to a fairly big problem in transportation.

29
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And maybe to put that in perspective: there's so much data on this,

30
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I'll be happy to give it to you in different forms.

31
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:18,000
You never know what strikes the fancy of whom,

32
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world.

33
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts.

34
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
What I don't think most people think about

35
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is the context of how technology is applied.

36
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
For instance, in that time, 91 percent of America

37
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
lived either on farms or in small towns.

38
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So, the car --

39
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal;

40
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage.

41
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It was half as long.

42
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And it was an environmental improvement, because, for instance,

43
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:59,000
in 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan,

44
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:02,000
because you can imagine what the roads look like

45
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:05,000
when you have a million horses,

46
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and a million of them urinating and doing other things,

47
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable.

48
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy.

49
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm,

50
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:26,000
or their farm to a town, or from a town to a city.

51
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It all made sense, with 91 percent of the people living there.

52
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:35,000
By the 1950s, we started connecting all the towns together

53
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:39,000
with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world, the highway system.

54
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And it is certainly a wonder.

55
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And by the way, as I take shots at old technologies,

56
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I want to assure everybody, and particularly the automotive industry --

57
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
who's been very supportive of us --

58
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that I don't think this in any way competes with airplanes, or cars.

59
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But think about where the world is today.

60
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:07,000
50 percent of the global population now lives in cities.

61
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
That's 3.2 billion people.

62
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:13,000
We've solved all the transportation problems

63
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that have changed the world to get it to where we are today.

64
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
500 years ago, sailing ships started getting reliable enough;

65
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:21,000
we found a new continent.

66
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:25,000
150 years ago, locomotives got efficient enough, steam power,

67
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that we turned the continent into a country.

68
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Over the last hundred years, we started building cars,

69
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and then over the 50 years we've connected every city to every other city

70
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:36,000
in an extraordinarily efficient way,

71
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that.

72
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But during that entire process, more and more people have been born,

73
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and more and more people are moving to cities.

74
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:5,000
China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people

75
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:53,000
into cities in the next decade and a half.

76
0:04:54,000 --> 0:05:,000
And so, nobody, I think, would argue that airplanes, in the last 50 years,

77
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:04,000
have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood.

78
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And if you just look at how technology has been applied,

79
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:1,000
we've solved all the long-range, high-speed, high-volume,

80
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
large-weight problems of moving things around.

81
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Nobody would want to give them up.

82
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And I certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane,

83
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:22,000
or my helicopter, or my Humvee, or my Porsche.

84
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I love them all. I don't keep any of them in my living room.

85
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:3,000
The fact is, the last mile is the problem,

86
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and half the world now lives in dense cities.

87
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And people spend, depending on who they are,

88
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:4,000
between 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot.

89
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I think there's -- I don't know what data would impress you,

90
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:49,000
but how about, 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the world

91
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:54,000
is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States.

92
0:05:55,000 --> 0:06:,000
Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air,

93
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and almost all particulate pollution on this planet

94
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:08,000
is produced by transportation devices, particularly sitting in cities.

95
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And again, I say that not to attack any industry,

96
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I think -- I really do -- I love my airplane,

97
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour

98
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:2,000
are extraordinarily efficient,

99
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:23,000
both from an engineering point of view,

100
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:26,000
an energy consumption point of view, and a utility point of view.

101
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And we all love our cars, and I do.

102
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The problem is, you get into the city and you want to go four blocks,

103
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
it's neither fun nor efficient nor productive.

104
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It's not sustainable.

105
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:44,000
If -- in China, in the year 1998, 417 million people used bicycles;

106
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:47,000
1.7 million people used cars.

107
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:52,000
If five percent of that population became, quote, middle class,

108
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years

109
0:06:57,000 --> 0:07:,000
at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities

110
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:04,000
of the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks --

111
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:06,000
it isn't sustainable environmentally;

112
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:1,000
it isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil --

113
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and it's not sustainable politically.

114
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I mean, what are we fighting over right now?

115
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We can make it complicated, but what's the world fighting over right now?

116
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile,

117
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and it was dumb luck. We were working on iBOTs,

118
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:3,000
but once we made this, we instantly decided

119
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:34,000
it could be a great alternative to jet skis. You don't need the water.

120
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Or snowmobiles. You don't need the snow.

121
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Or skiing. It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things.

122
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And every one of those industries, by the way --

123
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:48,000
just golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry.

124
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But rather than go license this off, which is what we normally do,

125
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:55,000
it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology,

126
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:59,000
but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems,

127
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:04,000
but has somehow come to accept that cities -- which,

128
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:07,000
right back from ancient Greece on, were meant to walk around,

129
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:1,000
cities that were architected and built for people --

130
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:12,000
now have a footprint that,

131
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:14,000
while we've solved every other transportation problem --

132
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and it's like Moore's law.

133
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I mean, look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon,

134
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:24,000
then on a railroad, then an airplane.

135
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Every other form of transportation's been improved.

136
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:32,000
In 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities.

137
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:35,000
They've gotten bigger; they're spread out.

138
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city --

139
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Wilshire Boulevard, or Fifth Avenue, or Tokyo, or Paris --

140
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:47,000
the most expensive real estate is their downtowns.

141
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:51,000
65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars.

142
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:53,000
The 20 largest cities in the world.

143
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians

144
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:02,000
what we take for granted as we now go between cities?

145
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:06,000
What if you could make them fun, attractive, clean,

146
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:08,000
environmentally friendly?

147
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:13,000
What if it would make it a little bit more palatable

148
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to have access via this, as that last link to mass transit,

149
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs

150
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and use our cars the way we want,

151
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and then have our cities energized again?

152
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:31,000
We thought it would be really neat to do that,

153
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and one of the problems we really were worried about

154
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
is: how do we get legal on the sidewalk?

155
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Because technically I've got motors; I've got wheels -- I'm a motor vehicle.

156
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I don't look like a motor vehicle.

157
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I have the same footprint as a pedestrian;

158
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I have the same unique capability

159
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:5,000
to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space.

160
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I took this down to Ground Zero,

161
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and knocked my way through crowds for an hour.

162
0:09:55,000 --> 0:10:,000
I'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two,

163
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices.

164
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:08,000
We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter,

165
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff.

166
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Or maybe we should be out in the street

167
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:18,000
in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle.

168
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:21,000
We've been so concerned about that,

169
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:23,000
we went to the Postmaster General of the United States,

170
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:26,000
as the first person we ever showed on the outside,

171
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and said, "Put your people on it. Everybody trusts their postman.

172
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And they belong on the sidewalks, and they'll use it seriously."

173
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:38,000
He agreed. We went to a number of police departments

174
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that want their police officers back in the neighborhood

175
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:44,000
on the beat, carrying 70 pounds of stuff. They love it.

176
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And I can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket.

177
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:51,000
(Laughter)

178
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So we've been working really, really hard,

179
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:56,000
but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop

180
0:10:56,000 --> 0:11:01,000
as an attitude about what's important, and how to apply the technology.

181
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:04,000
We went out and we found some visionary people

182
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:09,000
with enough money to let us design and build these things,

183
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted.

184
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:18,000
So, I'm happy, really, I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want.

185
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And yes, it's really fun, and yes, you should all go out and try it.

186
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:24,000
But if I could ask you to do one thing,

187
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:26,000
it's not to think about it as a piece of technology,

188
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
but just imagine that, although we all understand somehow

189
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that it's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine,

190
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:36,000
which can go 60 miles an hour,

191
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that can bring you everywhere you want to go,

192
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile,

193
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and it's broken, and it doesn't work.

194
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:5,000
One of the more exciting things that occurred to us

195
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:55,000
about why it might get accepted, happened out here in California.

196
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:57,000
A few weeks ago, after we launched it,

197
0:11:57,000 --> 0:12:02,000
we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach, zipping up and back,

198
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and he's marveling at the technology,

199
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by,

200
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and skateboarders are zipping by,

201
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and a little old lady -- I mean, if you looked in the dictionary,

202
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:15,000
a little old lady -- came by me --

203
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and now that I'm on this, I'm the height of a normal adult now --

204
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and she just stops, and the camera is there, and she looks up at me

205
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and says, "Can I try that?"

206
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And what was I -- you know, how are you going to say anything?

207
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And so I said, "Sure."

208
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So I get off, and she gets on, and with a little bit of the usual, ah,

209
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:44,000
then she turns around, and she goes about 20 feet,

210
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and she turns back around, and she's all smiles.

211
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And she comes back to me and she stops, and she says,

212
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:57,000
"Finally, they made something for us."

213
0:12:57,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And the camera is looking down at her.

214
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I'm thinking, "Wow, that was great --

215
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:02,000
(Laughter)

216
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:04,000
-- please lady, don't say another word."

217
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:07,000
(Laughter)

218
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And the camera is down at her,

219
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and this guy has to put the microphone in her face,

220
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:13,000
said, "What do you mean by that?"

221
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And I figured, "It's all over now,"

222
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and she looks up and she says, "Well,"

223
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:22,000
she's still watching these guys go; she says, "I can't ride a bike," no,

224
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:26,000
she says, "I can't use a skateboard, and I've never used roller blades,"

225
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
she knew them by name;

226
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:31,000
she says, "And it's been 50 years since I rode a bicycle."

227
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Then she looks up, she's looking up, and she says,

228
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:39,000
"And I'm 81 years old, and I don't drive a car anymore.

229
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I still have to get to the store, and I can't carry a lot of things."

230
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And it suddenly occurred to me, that among my many fears,

231
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:5,000
were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators

232
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and the legislators might not get it --

233
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:58,000
it was that, fundamentally, you believe there's pressure among the people

234
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:01,000
not to invade the most precious little bit of space left,

235
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:03,000
the sidewalks in these cities.

236
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:07,000
When you look at the 36 inches of legal requirement for sidewalk,

237
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:1,000
then the eight foot for the parked car, then the three lanes,

238
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and then the other eight feet -- it's --

239
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:16,000
that little piece is all that's there.

240
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
But she looks up and says this,

241
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and it occurs to me, well, kids aren't going to mind these things,

242
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and they don't vote, and business people and then young adults

243
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:26,000
aren't going to mind these things -- they're pretty cool --

244
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
so I guess subliminally I was worried

245
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that it's the older population that's going to worry.

246
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So, having seen this, and having worried about it for eight years,

247
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:4,000
the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys,

248
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:43,000
call AARP, get an appointment right away.

249
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:45,000
We've got to show them this thing.

250
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And they took it to Washington; they showed them;

251
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and they're going to be involved now,

252
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:54,000
watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities,

253
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:58,000
like Atlanta, where we're doing trials to see if it really can, in fact,

254
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:01,000
help re-energize their downtown.

255
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:08,000
(Applause)

256
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:13,000
The bottom line is, whether you believe the United Nations,

257
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:15,000
or any of the other think tanks --

258
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:19,000
in the next 20 years, all human population growth on this planet

259
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:21,000
will be in cities.

260
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:24,000
In Asia alone, it will be over a billion people.

261
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:28,000
They learned to start with cell phones.

262
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:31,000
They didn't have to take the 100-year trip we took.

263
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:34,000
They start at the top of the technology food chain.

264
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:37,000
We've got to start building cities and human environments

265
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:4,000
where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles

266
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:43,000
in a dense, rich, green-space environment,

267
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:47,000
without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it.

268
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Cars were not meant for parallel parking;

269
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:54,000
they're wonderful machines to go between cities, but just think about it:

270
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:59,000
we've solved all the long-range, high-speed problems.

271
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:04,000
The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals.

272
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:06,000
You do it in your sneakers.

273
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Not much has changed.

274
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:13,000
If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times --

275
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:15,000
a 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes.

276
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Your choice, when living in a city, if it's now 10 minutes --

277
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:24,000
because at 30 minutes you want an alternative, whether it's a bus, a train --

278
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:26,000
we've got to build an infrastructure -- a light rail --

279
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
or you're going to keep parking those cars.

280
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:31,000
But if you could put a pin in most cities,

281
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and imagine how far you could, if you had the time, walk in one half-hour, it's the city.

282
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:39,000
If you could make it fun, and make it eight or 10 minutes,

283
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:42,000
you can't find your car, un-park your car, move your car,

284
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:44,000
re-park your car and go somewhere;

285
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:47,000
you can't get to a cab or a subway.

286
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:5,000
We could change the way people allocate their resources,

287
0:16:5,000 --> 0:16:53,000
the way this planet uses its energy,

288
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:55,000
make it more fun.

289
0:16:55,000 --> 0:16:59,000
And we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right.

290
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:03,000
That's Segway. This is a Stirling cycle engine;

291
0:17:03,000 --> 0:17:07,000
this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing.

292
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:12,000
This little beast, right now, is producing a few hundred watts of electricity.

293
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:14,000
Yes, it could be attached to this,

294
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and yes, on a kilogram of propane,

295
0:17:17,000 --> 0:17:22,000
you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose.

296
0:17:22,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Perhaps more interesting about this little engine is it'll burn any fuel,

297
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
because some of you might be skeptical

298
0:17:28,000 --> 0:17:32,000
about the capability of this to have an impact,

299
0:17:32,000 --> 0:17:36,000
where most of the world you can't simply plug into your 120-volt outlet.

300
0:17:36,000 --> 0:17:38,000
We've been working on this,

301
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:4,000
actually, as an alternative energy source,

302
0:17:4,000 --> 0:17:42,000
starting way back with Johnson & Johnson, to run an iBOT,

303
0:17:42,000 --> 0:17:46,000
because the best batteries you could get --

304
0:17:46,000 --> 0:17:48,000
10 watt-hours per kilogram in lead,

305
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:5,000
20 watt-hours per kilogram nickel-cadmium,

306
0:17:5,000 --> 0:17:52,000
40 watt-hours per kilogram in nickel-metal hydride,

307
0:17:52,000 --> 0:17:55,000
60 watt-hours per kilogram in lithium,

308
0:17:55,000 --> 0:18:,000
8,750 watt-hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline --

309
0:18:,000 --> 0:18:02,000
which is why nobody drives electric cars.

310
0:18:02,000 --> 0:18:08,000
But, in any event, if you can burn it with the same efficiency --

311
0:18:08,000 --> 0:18:11,000
because it's external combustion -- as your kitchen stove,

312
0:18:11,000 --> 0:18:14,000
if you can burn any fuel, it turns out to be pretty neat.

313
0:18:14,000 --> 0:18:17,000
It makes just enough electricity to, for instance, do this,

314
0:18:17,000 --> 0:18:2,000
which at night is enough electricity, in the rest of the world,

315
0:18:2,000 --> 0:18:23,000
as Mr. Holly -- Dr. Holly -- pointed out,

316
0:18:23,000 --> 0:18:26,000
can run computers and a light bulb.

317
0:18:26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
But more interestingly, the thermodynamics of this say,

318
0:18:3,000 --> 0:18:33,000
you're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency.

319
0:18:33,000 --> 0:18:36,000
It doesn't matter much -- it says if you get 200 watts of electricity,

320
0:18:36,000 --> 0:18:39,000
you'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat.

321
0:18:39,000 --> 0:18:44,000
If you wanted to boil water and re-condense it at a rate of 10 gallons an hour,

322
0:18:44,000 --> 0:18:47,000
it takes about 25, a little over 25.3 kilowatt --

323
0:18:47,000 --> 0:18:51,000
25,000 watts of continuous power -- to do it.

324
0:18:51,000 --> 0:18:53,000
That's so much energy, you couldn't afford to desalinate

325
0:18:53,000 --> 0:18:55,000
or clean water in this country that way.

326
0:18:55,000 --> 0:18:59,000
Certainly, in the rest of the world, your choice is to devastate the place,

327
0:18:59,000 --> 0:19:04,000
turning everything that will burn into heat, or drink the water that's available.

328
0:19:04,000 --> 0:19:08,000
The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water.

329
0:19:08,000 --> 0:19:1,000
Depending on whose numbers you believe,

330
0:19:1,000 --> 0:19:13,000
it's between 60 and 85,000 people per day.

331
0:19:13,000 --> 0:19:16,000
We don't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world.

332
0:19:16,000 --> 0:19:18,000
We need water.

333
0:19:18,000 --> 0:19:21,000
And women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it,

334
0:19:21,000 --> 0:19:23,000
or watching their kids die.

335
0:19:23,000 --> 0:19:26,000
We figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing,

336
0:19:26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat,

337
0:19:29,000 --> 0:19:33,000
then using a little bit of the electricity control that process,

338
0:19:33,000 --> 0:19:39,000
and for 450 watts, which is a little more than half of its waste heat,

339
0:19:39,000 --> 0:19:41,000
it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water

340
0:19:41,000 --> 0:19:43,000
from anything that comes into it to cool it.

341
0:19:43,000 --> 0:19:46,000
So if we put this box on here in a few years,

342
0:19:46,000 --> 0:19:52,000
could we have a solution to transportation, electricity,

343
0:19:52,000 --> 0:19:56,000
and communication, and maybe drinkable water

344
0:19:56,000 --> 0:20:,000
in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds?

345
0:20:,000 --> 0:20:02,000
I don't know, but we'll try it.

346
0:20:02,000 --> 0:20:04,000
I better shut up.

347
0:20:04,000 --> 0:20:14,000
(Applause)

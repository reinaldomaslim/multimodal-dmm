1
0:00:12.988,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I've been thinking a lot about the world recently

2
0:00:16.045,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and how it's changed over the last 20, 30, 40 years.

3
0:00:19.732,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Twenty or 30 years ago,

4
0:00:22.151,000 --> 0:00:24,000
if a chicken caught a cold and sneezed and died

5
0:00:24.681,000 --> 0:00:25,000
in a remote village in East Asia,

6
0:00:26.65,000 --> 0:00:28,000
it would have been a tragedy for the chicken

7
0:00:29.02,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and its closest relatives,

8
0:00:30.217,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but I don't think there was much possibility

9
0:00:32.425,000 --> 0:00:34,000
of us fearing a global pandemic

10
0:00:35.1,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and the deaths of millions.

11
0:00:37.093,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Twenty or 30 years ago, if a bank in North America

12
0:00:39.821,000 --> 0:00:41,000
lent too much money to some people

13
0:00:41.966,000 --> 0:00:43,000
who couldn't afford to pay it back

14
0:00:43.987,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and the bank went bust,

15
0:00:45.719,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that was bad for the lender

16
0:00:46.736,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and bad for the borrower,

17
0:00:48.368,000 --> 0:00:49,000
but we didn't imagine it would bring

18
0:00:50.231,000 --> 0:00:52,000
the global economic system to its knees

19
0:00:52.446,000 --> 0:00:54,000
for nearly a decade.

20
0:00:55.248,000 --> 0:00:56,000
This is globalization.

21
0:00:56.834,000 --> 0:00:58,000
This is the miracle that has enabled us

22
0:00:59.32,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to transship our bodies and our minds

23
0:01:02.414,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and our words and our pictures and our ideas

24
0:01:04.776,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and our teaching and our learning around the planet

25
0:01:07.961,000 --> 0:01:1,000
ever faster and ever cheaper.

26
0:01:10.969,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It's brought a lot of bad stuff,

27
0:01:12.457,000 --> 0:01:13,000
like the stuff that I just described,

28
0:01:14.101,000 --> 0:01:16,000
but it's also brought a lot of good stuff.

29
0:01:16.703,000 --> 0:01:17,000
A lot of us are not aware

30
0:01:18.293,000 --> 0:01:21,000
of the extraordinary successes of the Millennium Development Goals,

31
0:01:22.27,000 --> 0:01:23,000
several of which have achieved their targets

32
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:25,000
long before the due date.

33
0:01:25.687,000 --> 0:01:28,000
That proves that this species of humanity

34
0:01:28.702,000 --> 0:01:31,000
is capable of achieving extraordinary progress

35
0:01:31.706,000 --> 0:01:35,000
if it really acts together and it really tries hard.

36
0:01:36.156,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But if I had to put it in a nutshell these days,

37
0:01:38.473,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I sort of feel that globalization

38
0:01:41.371,000 --> 0:01:42,000
has taken us by surprise,

39
0:01:43.214,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and we've been slow to respond to it.

40
0:01:45.994,000 --> 0:01:47,000
If you look at the downside of globalization,

41
0:01:48.225,000 --> 0:01:5,000
it really does seem to be sometimes overwhelming.

42
0:01:51.177,000 --> 0:01:53,000
All of the grand challenges that we face today,

43
0:01:53.286,000 --> 0:01:56,000
like climate change and human rights

44
0:01:56.443,000 --> 0:02:,000
and demographics and terrorism and pandemics

45
0:02:00.741,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and narco-trafficking and human slavery

46
0:02:03.384,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and species loss, I could go on,

47
0:02:06.104,000 --> 0:02:07,000
we're not making an awful lot of progress

48
0:02:08.06,000 --> 0:02:1,000
against an awful lot of those challenges.

49
0:02:10.442,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So in a nutshell, that's the challenge

50
0:02:12.305,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that we all face today

51
0:02:13.744,000 --> 0:02:15,000
at this interesting point in history.

52
0:02:16.242,000 --> 0:02:17,000
That's clearly what we've got to do next.

53
0:02:18.144,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We've somehow got to get our act together

54
0:02:21.19,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and we've got to figure out how to globalize

55
0:02:23.068,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the solutions better

56
0:02:25.003,000 --> 0:02:27,000
so that we don't simply become a species

57
0:02:27.547,000 --> 0:02:31,000
which is the victim of the globalization of problems.

58
0:02:32.463,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Why are we so slow at achieving these advances?

59
0:02:36.11,000 --> 0:02:38,000
What's the reason for it?

60
0:02:38.267,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Well, there are, of course, a number of reasons,

61
0:02:40.211,000 --> 0:02:42,000
but perhaps the primary reason

62
0:02:42.722,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is because we're still organized as a species

63
0:02:46.176,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in the same way that we were organized

64
0:02:47.778,000 --> 0:02:49,000
200 or 300 years ago.

65
0:02:50.45,000 --> 0:02:51,000
There's one superpower left on the planet

66
0:02:52.138,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and that is the seven billion people,

67
0:02:54.21,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the seven billion of us who cause all these problems,

68
0:02:56.6,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the same seven billion, by the way,

69
0:02:58.483,000 --> 0:02:59,000
who will resolve them all.

70
0:03:00.323,000 --> 0:03:02,000
But how are those seven billion organized?

71
0:03:02.762,000 --> 0:03:05,000
They're still organized in 200 or so nation-states,

72
0:03:06.452,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and the nations have governments

73
0:03:08.949,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that make rules

74
0:03:10.764,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and cause us to behave in certain ways.

75
0:03:13.696,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And that's a pretty efficient system,

76
0:03:15.586,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but the problem is that the way that those laws are made

77
0:03:18.567,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and the way those governments think

78
0:03:21.132,000 --> 0:03:23,000
is absolutely wrong for the solution of global problems,

79
0:03:23.618,000 --> 0:03:25,000
because it all looks inwards.

80
0:03:26.229,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The politicians that we elect

81
0:03:27.818,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and the politicians we don't elect, on the whole,

82
0:03:30.21,000 --> 0:03:31,000
have minds that microscope.

83
0:03:31.709,000 --> 0:03:33,000
They don't have minds that telescope.

84
0:03:34.409,000 --> 0:03:37,000
They look in. They pretend, they behave,

85
0:03:37.876,000 --> 0:03:41,000
as if they believed that every country was an island

86
0:03:42.27,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that existed quite happily, independently

87
0:03:44.251,000 --> 0:03:45,000
of all the others

88
0:03:45.726,000 --> 0:03:46,000
on its own little planet

89
0:03:47.543,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in its own little solar system.

90
0:03:49.495,000 --> 0:03:5,000
This is the problem:

91
0:03:51.298,000 --> 0:03:53,000
countries competing against each other,

92
0:03:53.416,000 --> 0:03:54,000
countries fighting against each other.

93
0:03:55.218,000 --> 0:03:56,000
This week, as any week you care to look at,

94
0:03:56.949,000 --> 0:03:59,000
you'll find people actually trying to kill each other from country to country,

95
0:04:00.382,000 --> 0:04:01,000
but even when that's not going on,

96
0:04:02.203,000 --> 0:04:03,000
there's competition between countries,

97
0:04:04.138,000 --> 0:04:06,000
each one trying to shaft the next.

98
0:04:06.75,000 --> 0:04:08,000
This is clearly not a good arrangement.

99
0:04:08.829,000 --> 0:04:09,000
We clearly need to change it.

100
0:04:10.79,000 --> 0:04:11,000
We clearly need to find ways

101
0:04:12.768,000 --> 0:04:14,000
of encouraging countries to start working together

102
0:04:15.413,000 --> 0:04:16,000
a little bit better.

103
0:04:17.024,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And why won't they do that?

104
0:04:19.294,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Why is it that our leaders still persist in looking inwards?

105
0:04:23.422,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Well, the first and most obvious reason

106
0:04:25.138,000 --> 0:04:26,000
is because that's what we ask them to do.

107
0:04:27.051,000 --> 0:04:28,000
That's what we tell them to do.

108
0:04:28.735,000 --> 0:04:29,000
When we elect governments

109
0:04:30.155,000 --> 0:04:32,000
or when we tolerate unelected governments,

110
0:04:32.686,000 --> 0:04:34,000
we're effectively telling them that what we want

111
0:04:35.162,000 --> 0:04:37,000
is for them to deliver us in our country

112
0:04:37.845,000 --> 0:04:38,000
a certain number of things.

113
0:04:39.578,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We want them to deliver prosperity,

114
0:04:42.533,000 --> 0:04:46,000
growth, competitiveness, transparency, justice

115
0:04:47.299,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and all of those things.

116
0:04:48.974,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So unless we start asking our governments

117
0:04:51.244,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to think outside a little bit,

118
0:04:53.525,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to consider the global problems that will finish us all

119
0:04:55.977,000 --> 0:04:56,000
if we don't start considering them,

120
0:04:57.936,000 --> 0:04:59,000
then we can hardly blame them

121
0:05:00.254,000 --> 0:05:02,000
if what they carry on doing is looking inwards,

122
0:05:02.969,000 --> 0:05:03,000
if they still have minds that microscope

123
0:05:04.781,000 --> 0:05:05,000
rather than minds that telescope.

124
0:05:06.707,000 --> 0:05:08,000
That's the first reason why things tend not to change.

125
0:05:09.645,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The second reason is that these governments,

126
0:05:12.899,000 --> 0:05:13,000
just like all the rest of us,

127
0:05:14.725,000 --> 0:05:16,000
are cultural psychopaths.

128
0:05:17.35,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I don't mean to be rude,

129
0:05:18.657,000 --> 0:05:19,000
but you know what a psychopath is.

130
0:05:20.064,000 --> 0:05:21,000
A psychopath is a person who,

131
0:05:21.792,000 --> 0:05:22,000
unfortunately for him or her,

132
0:05:23.329,000 --> 0:05:25,000
lacks the ability to really empathize

133
0:05:25.368,000 --> 0:05:26,000
with other human beings.

134
0:05:27.181,000 --> 0:05:28,000
When they look around,

135
0:05:28.32,000 --> 0:05:29,000
they don't see other human beings

136
0:05:29.982,000 --> 0:05:32,000
with deep, rich, three-dimensional personal lives

137
0:05:33.096,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and aims and ambitions.

138
0:05:34.224,000 --> 0:05:36,000
What they see is cardboard cutouts,

139
0:05:37.221,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and it's very sad and it's very lonely,

140
0:05:39.794,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and it's very rare, fortunately.

141
0:05:42.532,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But actually, aren't most of us

142
0:05:45.687,000 --> 0:05:47,000
not really so very good at empathy?

143
0:05:47.926,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Oh sure, we're very good at empathy

144
0:05:49.147,000 --> 0:05:5,000
when it's a question of dealing with people

145
0:05:50.9,000 --> 0:05:51,000
who kind of look like us

146
0:05:52.327,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and kind of walk and talk and eat and pray

147
0:05:54.809,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and wear like us,

148
0:05:56.491,000 --> 0:05:58,000
but when it comes to people who don't do that,

149
0:05:58.512,000 --> 0:05:59,000
who don't quite dress like us

150
0:05:59.929,000 --> 0:06:,000
and don't quite pray like us

151
0:06:01.776,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and don't quite talk like us,

152
0:06:04.181,000 --> 0:06:05,000
do we not also have a tendency to see them

153
0:06:06.06,000 --> 0:06:09,000
ever so slightly as cardboard cutouts too?

154
0:06:09.486,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And this is a question we need to ask ourselves.

155
0:06:11.194,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I think constantly we have to monitor it.

156
0:06:13.68,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Are we and our politicians to a degree

157
0:06:16.774,000 --> 0:06:18,000
cultural psychopaths?

158
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The third reason is hardly worth mentioning

159
0:06:20.808,000 --> 0:06:21,000
because it's so silly,

160
0:06:22.259,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but there's a belief amongst governments

161
0:06:24.199,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that the domestic agenda

162
0:06:25.713,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and the international agenda

163
0:06:27.22,000 --> 0:06:29,000
are incompatible and always will be.

164
0:06:29.92,000 --> 0:06:3,000
This is just nonsense.

165
0:06:31.83,000 --> 0:06:32,000
In my day job, I'm a policy adviser.

166
0:06:33.308,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I've spent the last 15 years or so

167
0:06:35.767,000 --> 0:06:36,000
advising governments around the world,

168
0:06:37.577,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and in all of that time I have never once seen

169
0:06:40.631,000 --> 0:06:42,000
a single domestic policy issue

170
0:06:42.995,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that could not be more imaginatively,

171
0:06:45.744,000 --> 0:06:47,000
effectively and rapidly resolved

172
0:06:48.128,000 --> 0:06:5,000
than by treating it as an international problem,

173
0:06:50.732,000 --> 0:06:51,000
looking at the international context,

174
0:06:52.523,000 --> 0:06:53,000
comparing what others have done,

175
0:06:54.318,000 --> 0:06:56,000
bringing in others, working externally

176
0:06:57.277,000 --> 0:07:,000
instead of working internally.

177
0:07:00.644,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And so you may say, well, given all of that,

178
0:07:03.866,000 --> 0:07:04,000
why then doesn't it work?

179
0:07:05.535,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Why can we not make our politicians change?

180
0:07:07.916,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Why can't we demand them?

181
0:07:10.238,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Well I, like a lot of us, spend a lot of time complaining

182
0:07:13.116,000 --> 0:07:15,000
about how hard it is to make people change,

183
0:07:15.469,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and I don't think we should fuss about it.

184
0:07:17.248,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I think we should just accept

185
0:07:18.844,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that we are an inherently conservative species.

186
0:07:21.615,000 --> 0:07:22,000
We don't like to change.

187
0:07:23.408,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It exists for very sensible evolutionary reasons.

188
0:07:26.352,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We probably wouldn't still be here today

189
0:07:29.119,000 --> 0:07:31,000
if we weren't so resistant to change.

190
0:07:31.189,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It's very simple: Many thousands of years ago,

191
0:07:33.742,000 --> 0:07:34,000
we discovered that if we carried on

192
0:07:35.688,000 --> 0:07:37,000
doing the same things, we wouldn't die,

193
0:07:38.118,000 --> 0:07:39,000
because the things that we've done before

194
0:07:39.96,000 --> 0:07:4,000
by definition didn't kill us,

195
0:07:41.538,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and therefore as long as we carry on doing them,

196
0:07:43.615,000 --> 0:07:44,000
we'll be okay,

197
0:07:45.022,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and it's very sensible not to do anything new,

198
0:07:46.69,000 --> 0:07:48,000
because it might kill you.

199
0:07:49.15,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But of course, there are exceptions to that.

200
0:07:51.432,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Otherwise, we'd never get anywhere.

201
0:07:53.934,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And one of the exceptions, the interesting exception,

202
0:07:55.7,000 --> 0:07:56,000
is when you can show to people

203
0:07:57.414,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that there might be some self-interest

204
0:07:59.762,000 --> 0:08:,000
in them making that leap of faith

205
0:08:01.449,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and changing a little bit.

206
0:08:03.716,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So I've spent a lot of the last 10 or 15 years

207
0:08:06.118,000 --> 0:08:09,000
trying to find out what could be that self-interest

208
0:08:09.256,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that would encourage not just politicians

209
0:08:11.405,000 --> 0:08:13,000
but also businesses and general populations,

210
0:08:13.958,000 --> 0:08:16,000
all of us, to start to think a little more outwardly,

211
0:08:16.973,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to think in a bigger picture,

212
0:08:19.212,000 --> 0:08:22,000
not always to look inwards, sometimes to look outwards.

213
0:08:22.554,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And this is where I discovered

214
0:08:24.645,000 --> 0:08:26,000
something quite important.

215
0:08:27.12,000 --> 0:08:3,000
In 2005, I launched a study

216
0:08:30.68,000 --> 0:08:32,000
called the Nation Brands Index.

217
0:08:33.27,000 --> 0:08:35,000
What it is, it's a very large-scale study that polls

218
0:08:35.778,000 --> 0:08:37,000
a very large sample of the world's population,

219
0:08:37.865,000 --> 0:08:39,000
a sample that represents about 70 percent

220
0:08:40.362,000 --> 0:08:43,000
of the planet's population,

221
0:08:43.591,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and I started asking them a series of questions

222
0:08:45.627,000 --> 0:08:47,000
about how they perceive other countries.

223
0:08:48.511,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And the Nation Brands Index over the years

224
0:08:50.155,000 --> 0:08:52,000
has grown to be a very, very large database.

225
0:08:52.658,000 --> 0:08:54,000
It's about 200 billion data points

226
0:08:55.09,000 --> 0:08:57,000
tracking what ordinary people think about other countries

227
0:08:57.666,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and why.

228
0:08:59.649,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Why did I do this? Well, because the governments that I advise

229
0:09:02.411,000 --> 0:09:03,000
are very, very keen on knowing

230
0:09:03.716,000 --> 0:09:04,000
how they are regarded.

231
0:09:05.331,000 --> 0:09:06,000
They've known, partly because

232
0:09:06.776,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I've encouraged them to realize it,

233
0:09:08.654,000 --> 0:09:09,000
that countries depend

234
0:09:10.252,000 --> 0:09:11,000
enormously on their reputations

235
0:09:11.808,000 --> 0:09:13,000
in order to survive and prosper in the world.

236
0:09:14.755,000 --> 0:09:16,000
If a country has a great, positive image,

237
0:09:17.004,000 --> 0:09:19,000
like Germany has or Sweden or Switzerland,

238
0:09:19.521,000 --> 0:09:21,000
everything is easy and everything is cheap.

239
0:09:21.616,000 --> 0:09:23,000
You get more tourists. You get more investors.

240
0:09:23.852,000 --> 0:09:25,000
You sell your products more expensively.

241
0:09:25.899,000 --> 0:09:26,000
If, on the other hand, you have a country

242
0:09:27.857,000 --> 0:09:29,000
with a very weak or a very negative image,

243
0:09:29.87,000 --> 0:09:31,000
everything is difficult and everything is expensive.

244
0:09:32.3,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So governments care desperately

245
0:09:34.201,000 --> 0:09:35,000
about the image of their country,

246
0:09:35.466,000 --> 0:09:37,000
because it makes a direct difference

247
0:09:37.6,000 --> 0:09:38,000
to how much money they can make,

248
0:09:39.241,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and that's what they've promised their populations

249
0:09:40.95,000 --> 0:09:42,000
they're going to deliver.

250
0:09:43.307,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So a couple of years ago, I thought I would take

251
0:09:45.27,000 --> 0:09:48,000
some time out and speak to that gigantic database

252
0:09:48.499,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and ask it,

253
0:09:50.706,000 --> 0:09:51,000
why do some people prefer one country

254
0:09:52.598,000 --> 0:09:53,000
more than another?

255
0:09:54.361,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And the answer that the database gave me

256
0:09:55.9,000 --> 0:09:56,000
completely staggered me.

257
0:09:57.596,000 --> 0:09:59,000
It was 6.8.

258
0:09:59.785,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I haven't got time to explain in detail.

259
0:10:01.874,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Basically what it told me was —

260
0:10:04.23,000 --> 0:10:08,000
(Laughter) (Applause) —

261
0:10:08.452,000 --> 0:10:12,000
the kinds of countries we prefer are good countries.

262
0:10:12.684,000 --> 0:10:14,000
We don't admire countries primarily because they're rich,

263
0:10:15.505,000 --> 0:10:17,000
because they're powerful, because they're successful,

264
0:10:17.529,000 --> 0:10:2,000
because they're modern, because they're technologically advanced.

265
0:10:20.893,000 --> 0:10:22,000
We primarily admire countries that are good.

266
0:10:23.746,000 --> 0:10:24,000
What do we mean by good?

267
0:10:25.109,000 --> 0:10:26,000
We mean countries that seem to contribute

268
0:10:26.78,000 --> 0:10:28,000
something to the world in which we live,

269
0:10:29.349,000 --> 0:10:31,000
countries that actually make the world safer

270
0:10:31.908,000 --> 0:10:33,000
or better or richer or fairer.

271
0:10:34.485,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Those are the countries we like.

272
0:10:35.95,000 --> 0:10:37,000
This is a discovery of significant importance —

273
0:10:38.471,000 --> 0:10:39,000
you see where I'm going —

274
0:10:39.824,000 --> 0:10:4,000
because it squares the circle.

275
0:10:41.691,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I can now say, and often do, to any government,

276
0:10:44.563,000 --> 0:10:46,000
in order to do well, you need to do good.

277
0:10:47.421,000 --> 0:10:48,000
If you want to sell more products,

278
0:10:48.916,000 --> 0:10:49,000
if you want to get more investment,

279
0:10:50.452,000 --> 0:10:52,000
if you want to become more competitive,

280
0:10:53.45,000 --> 0:10:54,000
then you need to start behaving,

281
0:10:55.115,000 --> 0:10:56,000
because that's why people will respect you

282
0:10:56.758,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and do business with you,

283
0:10:58.827,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and therefore, the more you collaborate,

284
0:11:01.91,000 --> 0:11:03,000
the more competitive you become.

285
0:11:04.755,000 --> 0:11:05,000
This is quite an important discovery,

286
0:11:06.533,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and as soon as I discovered this,

287
0:11:07.613,000 --> 0:11:09,000
I felt another index coming on.

288
0:11:09.858,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I swear that as I get older, my ideas become simpler

289
0:11:12.204,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and more and more childish.

290
0:11:13.5,000 --> 0:11:16,000
This one is called the Good Country Index,

291
0:11:17.468,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and it does exactly what it says on the tin.

292
0:11:21.521,000 --> 0:11:23,000
It measures, or at least it tries to measure,

293
0:11:23.875,000 --> 0:11:25,000
exactly how much each country on Earth contributes

294
0:11:26.638,000 --> 0:11:29,000
not to its own population but to the rest of humanity.

295
0:11:29.793,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Bizarrely, nobody had ever thought

296
0:11:31.06,000 --> 0:11:32,000
of measuring this before.

297
0:11:32.749,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So my colleague Dr. Robert Govers and I have spent

298
0:11:34.796,000 --> 0:11:35,000
the best part of the last two years,

299
0:11:36.539,000 --> 0:11:39,000
with the help of a large number of very serious and clever people,

300
0:11:40.193,000 --> 0:11:42,000
cramming together all the reliable data in the world

301
0:11:42.879,000 --> 0:11:44,000
we could find about what countries give

302
0:11:45.522,000 --> 0:11:46,000
to the world.

303
0:11:47.115,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And you're waiting for me to tell you which one comes top.

304
0:11:49.493,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And I'm going to tell you,

305
0:11:51.221,000 --> 0:11:52,000
but first of all I want to tell you

306
0:11:52.751,000 --> 0:11:54,000
precisely what I mean

307
0:11:55.456,000 --> 0:11:57,000
when I say a good country.

308
0:11:57.515,000 --> 0:11:59,000
I do not mean morally good.

309
0:11:59.739,000 --> 0:12:,000
When I say that Country X

310
0:12:01.701,000 --> 0:12:03,000
is the goodest country on Earth,

311
0:12:03.714,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and I mean goodest, I don't mean best.

312
0:12:05.023,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Best is something different.

313
0:12:06.476,000 --> 0:12:07,000
When you're talking about a good country,

314
0:12:07.77,000 --> 0:12:09,000
you can be good, gooder and goodest.

315
0:12:09.904,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It's not the same thing as good, better and best.

316
0:12:13.376,000 --> 0:12:15,000
This is a country which simply gives more

317
0:12:15.877,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to humanity than any other country.

318
0:12:18.203,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I don't talk about how they behave at home

319
0:12:19.945,000 --> 0:12:21,000
because that's measured elsewhere.

320
0:12:22.345,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And the winner is

321
0:12:24.405,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Ireland.

322
0:12:26.216,000 --> 0:12:31,000
(Applause)

323
0:12:31.89,000 --> 0:12:32,000
According to the data here,

324
0:12:33.795,000 --> 0:12:35,000
no country on Earth, per head of population,

325
0:12:36.685,000 --> 0:12:38,000
per dollar of GDP, contributes more

326
0:12:39.61,000 --> 0:12:4,000
to the world that we live in than Ireland.

327
0:12:41.246,000 --> 0:12:42,000
What does this mean?

328
0:12:42.341,000 --> 0:12:44,000
This means that as we go to sleep at night,

329
0:12:44.563,000 --> 0:12:47,000
all of us in the last 15 seconds before we drift off to sleep,

330
0:12:47.631,000 --> 0:12:48,000
our final thought should be,

331
0:12:49.626,000 --> 0:12:51,000
godammit, I'm glad that Ireland exists.

332
0:12:51.943,000 --> 0:12:53,000
(Laughter)

333
0:12:54.141,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And that — (Applause) —

334
0:13:01.238,000 --> 0:13:04,000
In the depths of a very severe economic recession,

335
0:13:04.238,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I think that there's a really important lesson there,

336
0:13:06.756,000 --> 0:13:08,000
that if you can remember your international obligations

337
0:13:08.872,000 --> 0:13:09,000
whilst you are trying to rebuild your own economy,

338
0:13:10.842,000 --> 0:13:11,000
that's really something.

339
0:13:11.88,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Finland ranks pretty much the same.

340
0:13:13.535,000 --> 0:13:14,000
The only reason why it's below Ireland

341
0:13:14.8,000 --> 0:13:17,000
is because its lowest score is lower than Ireland's lowest score.

342
0:13:17.883,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Now the other thing you'll notice about the top 10 there

343
0:13:19.68,000 --> 0:13:21,000
is, of course, they're all, apart from New Zealand,

344
0:13:22.54,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Western European nations.

345
0:13:24.25,000 --> 0:13:25,000
They're also all rich.

346
0:13:25.93,000 --> 0:13:26,000
This depressed me,

347
0:13:27.67,000 --> 0:13:28,000
because one of the things that I did not want

348
0:13:29.182,000 --> 0:13:3,000
to discover with this index

349
0:13:30.76,000 --> 0:13:32,000
is that it's purely the province of rich countries

350
0:13:33.116,000 --> 0:13:34,000
to help poor countries.

351
0:13:34.141,000 --> 0:13:36,000
This is not what it's all about.

352
0:13:36.197,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And indeed, if you look further down the list,

353
0:13:37.773,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I don't have the slide here, you will see

354
0:13:40.099,000 --> 0:13:42,000
something that made me very happy indeed,

355
0:13:42.388,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that Kenya is in the top 30,

356
0:13:44.919,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and that demonstrates one very, very important thing.

357
0:13:47.804,000 --> 0:13:48,000
This is not about money.

358
0:13:49.667,000 --> 0:13:5,000
This is about attitude.

359
0:13:51.064,000 --> 0:13:52,000
This is about culture.

360
0:13:52.53,000 --> 0:13:55,000
This is about a government and a people that care

361
0:13:55.977,000 --> 0:13:56,000
about the rest of the world

362
0:13:57.171,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and have the imagination and the courage

363
0:13:59.163,000 --> 0:14:02,000
to think outwards instead of only thinking selfishly.

364
0:14:02.4,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I'm going to whip through the other slides

365
0:14:04.18,000 --> 0:14:06,000
just so you can see some of the lower-lying countries.

366
0:14:07.128,000 --> 0:14:1,000
There's Germany at 13th, the U.S. comes 21st,

367
0:14:10.41,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Mexico comes 66th,

368
0:14:12.151,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and then we have some of the big developing countries,

369
0:14:14.269,000 --> 0:14:17,000
like Russia at 95th, China at 107th.

370
0:14:17.409,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Countries like China and Russia and India,

371
0:14:20.413,000 --> 0:14:22,000
which is down in the same part of the index,

372
0:14:22.966,000 --> 0:14:24,000
well, in some ways, it's not surprising.

373
0:14:25.319,000 --> 0:14:26,000
They've spent a great deal of time

374
0:14:26.858,000 --> 0:14:28,000
over the last decades building their own economy,

375
0:14:29.021,000 --> 0:14:31,000
building their own society and their own polity,

376
0:14:31.707,000 --> 0:14:32,000
but it is to be hoped

377
0:14:33.373,000 --> 0:14:34,000
that the second phase of their growth

378
0:14:34.74,000 --> 0:14:35,000
will be somewhat more outward-looking

379
0:14:36.725,000 --> 0:14:38,000
than the first phase has been so far.

380
0:14:39.252,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And then you can break down each country

381
0:14:41.36,000 --> 0:14:44,000
in terms of the actual datasets that build into it.

382
0:14:44.716,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I'll allow you to do that.

383
0:14:45.565,000 --> 0:14:47,000
From midnight tonight it's going to be on goodcountry.org,

384
0:14:48.227,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and you can look at the country.

385
0:14:49.41,000 --> 0:14:52,000
You can look right down to the level of the individual datasets.

386
0:14:53.278,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Now that's the Good Country Index.

387
0:14:55.496,000 --> 0:14:56,000
What's it there for?

388
0:14:56.865,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Well, it's there really because I want to try

389
0:14:59.15,000 --> 0:15:01,000
to introduce this word,

390
0:15:01.601,000 --> 0:15:05,000
or reintroduce this word, into the discourse.

391
0:15:05.924,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I've had enough hearing about competitive countries.

392
0:15:08.113,000 --> 0:15:09,000
I've had enough hearing about

393
0:15:09.908,000 --> 0:15:12,000
prosperous, wealthy, fast-growing countries.

394
0:15:13.694,000 --> 0:15:16,000
I've even had enough hearing about happy countries

395
0:15:16.942,000 --> 0:15:18,000
because in the end that's still selfish.

396
0:15:18.983,000 --> 0:15:19,000
That's still about us,

397
0:15:20.487,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and if we carry on thinking about us,

398
0:15:22.355,000 --> 0:15:24,000
we are in deep, deep trouble.

399
0:15:24.897,000 --> 0:15:25,000
I think we all know what it is

400
0:15:26.528,000 --> 0:15:27,000
that we want to hear about.

401
0:15:27.651,000 --> 0:15:3,000
We want to hear about good countries,

402
0:15:30.696,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and so I want to ask you all a favor.

403
0:15:34.326,000 --> 0:15:35,000
I'm not asking a lot.

404
0:15:35.922,000 --> 0:15:36,000
It's something that you might find easy to do

405
0:15:37.875,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and you might even find enjoyable

406
0:15:38.9,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and even helpful to do,

407
0:15:40.503,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and that's simply to start using the word "good"

408
0:15:43.785,000 --> 0:15:44,000
in this context.

409
0:15:45.467,000 --> 0:15:47,000
When you think about your own country,

410
0:15:47.654,000 --> 0:15:49,000
when you think about other people's countries,

411
0:15:49.783,000 --> 0:15:5,000
when you think about companies,

412
0:15:51.566,000 --> 0:15:53,000
when you talk about the world that we live in today,

413
0:15:53.777,000 --> 0:15:54,000
start using that word

414
0:15:55.675,000 --> 0:15:57,000
in the way that I've talked about this evening.

415
0:15:58.443,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Not good, the opposite of bad,

416
0:16:00.347,000 --> 0:16:02,000
because that's an argument that never finishes.

417
0:16:02.623,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Good, the opposite of selfish,

418
0:16:04.967,000 --> 0:16:07,000
good being a country that thinks about all of us.

419
0:16:08.15,000 --> 0:16:09,000
That's what I would like you to do,

420
0:16:09.56,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and I'd like you to use it as a stick

421
0:16:10.945,000 --> 0:16:12,000
with which to beat your politicians.

422
0:16:13.588,000 --> 0:16:15,000
When you elect them, when you reelect them,

423
0:16:15.895,000 --> 0:16:16,000
when you vote for them, when you listen

424
0:16:17.307,000 --> 0:16:19,000
to what they're offering you,

425
0:16:19.842,000 --> 0:16:2,000
use that word, "good,"

426
0:16:21.554,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and ask yourself,

427
0:16:23.038,000 --> 0:16:25,000
"Is that what a good country would do?"

428
0:16:25.111,000 --> 0:16:28,000
And if the answer is no, be very suspicious.

429
0:16:28.404,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Ask yourself, is that the behavior

430
0:16:30.829,000 --> 0:16:31,000
of my country?

431
0:16:32.265,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Do I want to come from a country

432
0:16:34.397,000 --> 0:16:35,000
where the government, in my name,

433
0:16:35.964,000 --> 0:16:36,000
is doing things like that?

434
0:16:37.826,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Or do I, on the other hand,

435
0:16:39.582,000 --> 0:16:4,000
prefer the idea of walking around the world

436
0:16:41.21,000 --> 0:16:43,000
with my head held high thinking, "Yeah,

437
0:16:43.364,000 --> 0:16:45,000
I'm proud to come from a good country"?

438
0:16:45.855,000 --> 0:16:46,000
And everybody will welcome you.

439
0:16:47.843,000 --> 0:16:48,000
And everybody in the last 15 seconds

440
0:16:49.467,000 --> 0:16:51,000
before they drift off to sleep at night will say,

441
0:16:52.137,000 --> 0:16:54,000
"Gosh, I'm glad that person's country exists."

442
0:16:55.018,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Ultimately, that, I think,

443
0:16:57.205,000 --> 0:16:58,000
is what will make the change.

444
0:16:58.959,000 --> 0:16:59,000
That word, "good,"

445
0:17:00.676,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and the number 6.8

446
0:17:02.323,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and the discovery that's behind it

447
0:17:04.581,000 --> 0:17:05,000
have changed my life.

448
0:17:06.249,000 --> 0:17:07,000
I think they can change your life,

449
0:17:08.136,000 --> 0:17:09,000
and I think we can use it to change

450
0:17:09.995,000 --> 0:17:11,000
the way that our politicians and our companies behave,

451
0:17:12.415,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and in doing so, we can change the world.

452
0:17:16.28,000 --> 0:17:17,000
I've started thinking very differently about

453
0:17:17.83,000 --> 0:17:19,000
my own country since I've been thinking about these things.

454
0:17:20.523,000 --> 0:17:22,000
I used to think that I wanted to live in a rich country,

455
0:17:22.61,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and then I started thinking I wanted to live in a happy country,

456
0:17:25.01,000 --> 0:17:27,000
but I began to realize, it's not enough.

457
0:17:27.624,000 --> 0:17:29,000
I don't want to live in a rich country.

458
0:17:29.669,000 --> 0:17:3,000
I don't want to live in a fast-growing

459
0:17:31.602,000 --> 0:17:33,000
or competitive country.

460
0:17:34.285,000 --> 0:17:37,000
I want to live in a good country,

461
0:17:37.403,000 --> 0:17:4,000
and I so, so hope that you do too.

462
0:17:40.896,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Thank you.

463
0:17:43.48,000 --> 0:17:47,000
(Applause)

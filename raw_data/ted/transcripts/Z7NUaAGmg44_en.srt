2
0:00:12.844,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm a biological oceanographer.

3
0:00:15.698,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I have the absolute privilege of studying microbial lives

4
0:00:20.349,000 --> 0:00:21,000
in the Pacific Ocean.

5
0:00:22.311,000 --> 0:00:23,000
So we'll talk about microbes in a minute,

6
0:00:24.311,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but I first want to give you a sense of place,

7
0:00:26.509,000 --> 0:00:27,000
a sense of scale.

8
0:00:28.193,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The Pacific Ocean is our largest, deepest ocean basin.

9
0:00:32.276,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It covers 60 million square miles.

10
0:00:35.179,000 --> 0:00:37,000
If you took all the continents and you put them together

11
0:00:37.899,000 --> 0:00:38,000
in a little Pangaea 2.0,

12
0:00:39.186,000 --> 0:00:42,000
they'd fit snug inside the Pacific, with room to spare.

13
0:00:42.561,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It's a massive ecosystem,

14
0:00:44.766,000 --> 0:00:47,000
from the blues of the open ocean to the green of the continental margins.

15
0:00:49.195,000 --> 0:00:5,000
In this place,

16
0:00:50.76,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I get to study the base of the food web:

17
0:00:53.11,000 --> 0:00:54,000
plankton.

18
0:00:54.838,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Now, in my research,

19
0:00:57.934,000 --> 0:01:,000
and really in the field of microbial oceanography as a whole,

20
0:01:01.759,000 --> 0:01:03,000
there's a theme that has emerged,

21
0:01:04.272,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and that theme is "change."

22
0:01:06.825,000 --> 0:01:1,000
These microbial ecosystems are changing in real and measurable ways,

23
0:01:11.381,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and it is not that hard to see it.

24
0:01:14.586,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Oceans cover 70 percent of our planet,

25
0:01:17.316,000 --> 0:01:2,000
so ocean change is planetary change,

26
0:01:20.466,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and it all starts with microbes.

27
0:01:23.568,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Now, I have two vignettes to share with you,

28
0:01:28.187,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and these are meant to be love stories to microbes.

29
0:01:33.647,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But I'll be honest that there's an aspect of it

30
0:01:36.966,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that's just a total bummer,

31
0:01:40.218,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and, beware, focus on the love.

32
0:01:42.453,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Right? That's where I'm coming from.

33
0:01:44.728,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So the first thing to know

34
0:01:48.355,000 --> 0:01:51,000
is that the forests of the sea are microbial.

35
0:01:51.736,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And what I mean by that is that, by and large,

36
0:01:55.061,000 --> 0:01:58,000
plants in the open ocean are microscopic,

37
0:01:58.434,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and they are much more abundant than we realize.

38
0:02:02.042,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So I'm going to show you some mug shots of these organisms

39
0:02:06.011,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that I've collected over the years.

40
0:02:08.035,000 --> 0:02:11,000
These are the lowest rungs of the ocean food web.

41
0:02:12.199,000 --> 0:02:14,000
These are tiny plants and animals

42
0:02:14.287,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that come in a variety of shapes and sizes and colors and metabolisms.

43
0:02:19.341,000 --> 0:02:22,000
There are hundreds of thousands in a single milliliter of seawater.

44
0:02:22.825,000 --> 0:02:25,000
You are definitely swimming with them when you're in the ocean.

45
0:02:26.356,000 --> 0:02:28,000
They produce oxygen, they consume CO2,

46
0:02:28.754,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and they form the base of the food web

47
0:02:30.61,000 --> 0:02:33,000
on which every other form of ocean life is reliant.

48
0:02:35.11,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Now, I've spent about 500 days of my scientific life at sea,

49
0:02:40.031,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and a lot more in front of a computer or in the lab,

50
0:02:43.312,000 --> 0:02:47,000
so I feel compelled to tell you some of their stories.

51
0:02:48.825,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Let's start in the Pacific Northwest.

52
0:02:52.253,000 --> 0:02:54,000
This place is green. It is beautiful.

53
0:02:55.235,000 --> 0:02:58,000
These are blooms of phytoplankton that you can see from space

54
0:02:58.278,000 --> 0:03:,000
along the West Coast of the United States.

55
0:03:00.868,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It's an incredibly productive ecosystem.

56
0:03:04.293,000 --> 0:03:07,000
This is where you go to salmon fish, halibut fish, whale watch.

57
0:03:08.088,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It's a beautiful part of our country.

58
0:03:10.331,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And here, for 10 years, among other things,

59
0:03:13.111,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I studied the uplifting topic of harmful algal blooms.

60
0:03:18.167,000 --> 0:03:2,000
These are blooms of toxin-producing phytoplankton

61
0:03:21.136,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that can contaminate food webs and accumulate in shellfish and fish

62
0:03:25.698,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that are harvested for human consumption.

63
0:03:28.925,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We were trying to understand why they bloom, where they bloom,

64
0:03:32.837,000 --> 0:03:33,000
when they bloom,

65
0:03:34.156,000 --> 0:03:35,000
so we could manage these harvests

66
0:03:36.156,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and protect human health.

67
0:03:38.178,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Now, the problem is the ocean's a moving target

68
0:03:41.043,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and, much like some people in our lives, toxicity varies among the plankton.

69
0:03:46.631,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:47.656,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Alright?

71
0:03:48.831,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So, to get around these challenges,

72
0:03:50.752,000 --> 0:03:53,000
we combined satellite remote sensing

73
0:03:54.394,000 --> 0:03:55,000
with drones and gliders,

74
0:03:56.085,000 --> 0:03:57,000
regular sampling of the surf zone

75
0:03:58.062,000 --> 0:04:,000
and a lot of time at sea

76
0:04:00.723,000 --> 0:04:02,000
in small boats off the Oregon coast.

77
0:04:03.731,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And I don't know if many of you have had the opportunity to do that,

78
0:04:06.959,000 --> 0:04:07,000
but it is not easy.

79
0:04:08.539,000 --> 0:04:09,000
[Even oceanographers get seasick]

80
0:04:10.53,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Here's some poor students.

81
0:04:12.301,000 --> 0:04:13,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:13.326,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I've hidden their faces to protect their identities.

83
0:04:15.99,000 --> 0:04:17,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:18.66,000 --> 0:04:19,000
This is a challenging place.

85
0:04:20.419,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So this is hard-won data I'm about to talk about, OK?

86
0:04:23.673,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:24.704,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So by combining all of our data with our collaborators,

88
0:04:27.846,000 --> 0:04:32,000
we had 20-year time series of toxins and phytoplankton cell counts.

89
0:04:32.998,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And that allowed us to understand the patterns of these blooms

90
0:04:37.062,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and to build models to predict them.

91
0:04:39.911,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And what we found

92
0:04:41.446,000 --> 0:04:46,000
was that the risk of harmful algal blooms was tightly linked to aspects of climate.

93
0:04:47.29,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Now when I say "climate," I don't mean weather day-to-day,

94
0:04:50.067,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I mean long-term changes.

95
0:04:53.146,000 --> 0:04:55,000
These oscillations that you may have heard of --

96
0:04:55.876,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, El Niño --

97
0:04:58.622,000 --> 0:05:01,000
they usually bring warm, dry winters to this region,

98
0:05:02.177,000 --> 0:05:04,000
but they also reduce the strength of the California Current,

99
0:05:05.122,000 --> 0:05:09,000
which runs from the north to the south along the Pacific Northwest,

100
0:05:09.557,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and they warm the coastal ocean.

101
0:05:11.55,000 --> 0:05:13,000
These are the reds you're seeing in this plot,

102
0:05:13.775,000 --> 0:05:14,000
warm anomalies,

103
0:05:14.973,000 --> 0:05:16,000
strong positive indices of the PDO.

104
0:05:17.758,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And when we have these changes in circulation

105
0:05:20.577,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and changes in temperature,

106
0:05:22.433,000 --> 0:05:24,000
the risk of harmful algal blooms is increased,

107
0:05:25.17,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but also salmon recruitment has decreased,

108
0:05:27.973,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and we see intrusions of invasive species like green crab.

109
0:05:31.805,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So these are ecological and economic impacts of climate.

110
0:05:36.535,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Now, if our models are right,

111
0:05:38.85,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the frequency and severity of these events are only going to get worse,

112
0:05:42.321,000 --> 0:05:44,000
right along with these warm anomalies.

113
0:05:44.883,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And, to illustrate that,

114
0:05:47.492,000 --> 0:05:51,000
2014 was probably one of the worst harmful algal blooms in Oregon history.

115
0:05:52.429,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It was also the hottest year in the modern climate record at that time,

116
0:05:58.137,000 --> 0:06:,000
that is until 2015,

117
0:06:01.05,000 --> 0:06:02,000
2016,

118
0:06:02.867,000 --> 0:06:04,000
2017, 2018.

119
0:06:05.727,000 --> 0:06:08,000
In fact, the five hottest years in the modern climate record

120
0:06:09.229,000 --> 0:06:1,000
have been the last five.

121
0:06:11.666,000 --> 0:06:13,000
That bodes really well for harmful algal blooms

122
0:06:14.021,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and poorly for ecosystem health.

123
0:06:17.427,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Now, you may not care about shellfish,

124
0:06:20.453,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but these changes impact economically important fisheries,

125
0:06:24.7,000 --> 0:06:25,000
like crab and salmon,

126
0:06:26.294,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and they can impact the health of marine mammals like whales.

127
0:06:29.597,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And that might matter a little bit more.

128
0:06:31.564,000 --> 0:06:32,000
That might resonate.

129
0:06:34.454,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So, there's your doomsday tale for the margins of the Pacific.

130
0:06:40.854,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Actually, these are really resilient ecosystems.

131
0:06:43.669,000 --> 0:06:45,000
They can absolutely bounce back if we give them a chance.

132
0:06:46.661,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The point is not to ignore the changes that we're seeing,

133
0:06:51.325,000 --> 0:06:52,000
which brings me to my second vignette.

134
0:06:54.879,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I have since moved to the most remote island chain on our planet,

135
0:06:59.763,000 --> 0:07:,000
the Hawaiian Islands,

136
0:07:01.412,000 --> 0:07:04,000
where I'm the new lead of a program called the Hawaiian Ocean Time-series.

137
0:07:05.403,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And this is a program that for 31 years

138
0:07:07.825,000 --> 0:07:1,000
has made this monthly pilgrimage to a spot called Station ALOHA.

139
0:07:11.933,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It's in the middle of the Pacific Ocean,

140
0:07:14.191,000 --> 0:07:17,000
in the center of this vast, swirling system of currents

141
0:07:17.303,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that we call the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre.

142
0:07:20.638,000 --> 0:07:22,000
It's our largest ocean ecosystem.

143
0:07:22.869,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It's four times the size of the Amazon rain forest.

144
0:07:25.937,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It is warm, in a good way.

145
0:07:28.072,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It is blue water,

146
0:07:29.311,000 --> 0:07:32,000
it's absolutely the type of place you want to dive in and swim.

147
0:07:32.392,000 --> 0:07:33,000
You cannot do that off of research boats,

148
0:07:34.38,000 --> 0:07:36,000
because, you know, sharks. Google it.

149
0:07:36.912,000 --> 0:07:39,000
(Laughter)

150
0:07:40.623,000 --> 0:07:42,000
This is a beautiful place.

151
0:07:43.427,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And here, since October of 1988,

152
0:07:46.265,000 --> 0:07:5,000
generations of researchers have made these monthly pilgrimages.

153
0:07:50.876,000 --> 0:07:53,000
We study the biology, the chemistry, the physics of the open ocean.

154
0:07:54.297,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We've measured the temperature from the surface to the seafloor.

155
0:07:57.928,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We've tracked the currents, traced the waves.

156
0:08:01.026,000 --> 0:08:04,000
People have discovered new organisms here.

157
0:08:04.258,000 --> 0:08:06,000
People have created vast genomic libraries

158
0:08:06.983,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that have revolutionized

159
0:08:08.34,000 --> 0:08:11,000
what we think about the diversity of marine microorganisms.

160
0:08:11.649,000 --> 0:08:12,000
It's not just a place of discovery,

161
0:08:13.408,000 --> 0:08:15,000
but the important part about time series

162
0:08:16.237,000 --> 0:08:18,000
are that they provide us a sense of history,

163
0:08:18.366,000 --> 0:08:19,000
a sense of context.

164
0:08:20.586,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And in 30 years of data,

165
0:08:22.087,000 --> 0:08:25,000
it's allowed us to separate the seasonal change

166
0:08:25.79,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and see the emergence of humanity's fingerprints

167
0:08:28.612,000 --> 0:08:29,000
on the natural world.

168
0:08:31.427,000 --> 0:08:33,000
There's another iconic time series in Hawaii,

169
0:08:34.324,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and that is the Keeling Curve.

170
0:08:35.825,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I hope you have all seen this.

171
0:08:37.995,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This time series has documented the rapid increase in carbon dioxide

172
0:08:41.972,000 --> 0:08:42,000
in the atmosphere.

173
0:08:43.354,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It's not just the number, it's the rate of increase.

174
0:08:46.647,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The rate of carbon dioxide increase in our atmosphere

175
0:08:49.393,000 --> 0:08:5,000
is unprecedented for our planet.

176
0:08:52.142,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And that has consequences for our oceans.

177
0:08:54.903,000 --> 0:08:57,000
In fact, oceans absorb about 90 percent of the heat that's generated

178
0:08:58.475,000 --> 0:08:59,000
by greenhouse gas emissions

179
0:08:59.968,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and about 40 percent of the carbon dioxide.

180
0:09:03.928,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And we have been able to measure that at Station ALOHA.

181
0:09:08.025,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Each one of these dots is a cruise.

182
0:09:10.841,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It represents people's lives over 30 years trying to make these measurements,

183
0:09:14.77,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and it took 30 years to be able to see this.

184
0:09:17.587,000 --> 0:09:18,000
CO2 rises in the atmosphere,

185
0:09:19.398,000 --> 0:09:2,000
CO2 rises in the ocean.

186
0:09:20.755,000 --> 0:09:21,000
That's the red line.

187
0:09:22.777,000 --> 0:09:23,000
A consequence of that

188
0:09:24.452,000 --> 0:09:26,000
is a fundamental change in the chemistry of seawater,

189
0:09:27.365,000 --> 0:09:28,000
a decline in pH --

190
0:09:29.208,000 --> 0:09:3,000
pH is on a log scale,

191
0:09:30.463,000 --> 0:09:31,000
here's your blue line.

192
0:09:31.993,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So we've seen a 30 percent decline in pH in the surface ocean

193
0:09:35.69,000 --> 0:09:36,000
in this time series.

194
0:09:37.589,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Now that has impacts for organisms that need to feed, build shells,

195
0:09:41.324,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that changes growth rates, metabolic interactions,

196
0:09:44.369,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and it doesn't just impact plankton --

197
0:09:46.266,000 --> 0:09:48,000
it impacts ecosystems as large as coral reefs.

198
0:09:50.294,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Now one of the things we've been able to show in this time series

199
0:09:53.477,000 --> 0:09:54,000
is this is just skimming the surface.

200
0:09:56.31,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Increases in CO2 and a decline in pH

201
0:09:59.496,000 --> 0:10:02,000
are measured over the top 500 meters of the water column.

202
0:10:03.738,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I really find that to be profound.

203
0:10:06.727,000 --> 0:10:1,000
This is genuinely one of the most remote places on our planet,

204
0:10:10.778,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and we've impacted the top 500 meters of the water column.

205
0:10:16.254,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Now, these two things --

206
0:10:18.097,000 --> 0:10:2,000
harmful algal blooms, ocean acidification --

207
0:10:20.677,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that's not all, of course.

208
0:10:21.991,000 --> 0:10:22,000
You've heard of the rest:

209
0:10:23.309,000 --> 0:10:26,000
sea-level rise, eutrophication, melting of the polar ice caps,

210
0:10:27.222,000 --> 0:10:3,000
expansion of oxygen minimum zones, pollution, loss of biodiversity,

211
0:10:31.039,000 --> 0:10:32,000
overfishing.

212
0:10:32.327,000 --> 0:10:33,000
It's hard for me to get a grad student --

213
0:10:34.328,000 --> 0:10:36,000
you can see this pitch is a difficult one, right?

214
0:10:36.764,000 --> 0:10:37,000
(Laughter)

215
0:10:39.447,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Sighs)

216
0:10:40.932,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Again, I think these systems, these microbial ecosystems,

217
0:10:44.955,000 --> 0:10:45,000
are immensely resilient.

218
0:10:47.126,000 --> 0:10:49,000
We just cannot go too far down this path.

219
0:10:51.087,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I personally believe that sustained observation of our oceans and our planet

220
0:10:54.858,000 --> 0:10:57,000
is the moral imperative for our generation of scientists.

221
0:10:58.706,000 --> 0:11:,000
We are bearing witness

222
0:11:00.944,000 --> 0:11:04,000
to the changes that are being inflicted upon our natural communities,

223
0:11:05.588,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and by doing so,

224
0:11:07.032,000 --> 0:11:12,000
it provides us the opportunity to adapt and enact global change,

225
0:11:12.828,000 --> 0:11:13,000
if we're willing.

226
0:11:14.406,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So the solutions to these problems are multitiered.

227
0:11:17.958,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It involves a portfolio of solutions,

228
0:11:19.745,000 --> 0:11:2,000
local change,

229
0:11:20.971,000 --> 0:11:23,000
but all the way up to voting for people who will protect our environment

230
0:11:24.407,000 --> 0:11:25,000
on a global scale.

231
0:11:26.027,000 --> 0:11:33,000
(Applause)

232
0:11:39.968,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Let's bring it back to the love.

233
0:11:41.548,000 --> 0:11:43,000
(Laughter)

234
0:11:44.341,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Microbes matter.

235
0:11:46.025,000 --> 0:11:48,000
These organisms are small,

236
0:11:48.478,000 --> 0:11:49,000
abundant, ancient,

237
0:11:50.176,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and they are critical to sustaining our population and our planet.

238
0:11:54.433,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Yet we are on track to double our carbon dioxide emissions

239
0:11:57.592,000 --> 0:11:58,000
in the next 50 years,

240
0:11:59.045,000 --> 0:12:,000
so the analogy that I use for that

241
0:12:00.965,000 --> 0:12:03,000
is like we are eating like we're still in our 20s,

242
0:12:04.849,000 --> 0:12:06,000
assuming there will be no consequences --

243
0:12:07.102,000 --> 0:12:08,000
but I'm a woman in her 40s,

244
0:12:08.428,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I know there are consequences for my fuel consumption. Right?

245
0:12:12.431,000 --> 0:12:14,000
(Laughter)

246
0:12:14.481,000 --> 0:12:15,000
These oceans are very much alive.

247
0:12:16.276,000 --> 0:12:18,000
These ecosystems have not collapsed.

248
0:12:20.019,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Well, except for the Arctic, we can talk about that.

249
0:12:23.013,000 --> 0:12:24,000
(Laughter)

250
0:12:24.456,000 --> 0:12:27,000
But the sustained observations that I've shared with you today,

251
0:12:27.902,000 --> 0:12:29,000
the work of generations of scientists,

252
0:12:30.534,000 --> 0:12:33,000
are pointing us to take better care of our oceans

253
0:12:33.83,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and to nurture the microbes that sustain us.

254
0:12:37.335,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And on that note,

255
0:12:38.536,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I want to end with a quote from one of my heroes,

256
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Jane Lubchenco.

257
0:12:43.992,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And this slide is appropriate.

258
0:12:46.509,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Jane has said that the oceans are not too big to fail,

259
0:12:51.991,000 --> 0:12:52,000
nor are they too big to fix,

260
0:12:55.181,000 --> 0:12:57,000
but the oceans are too big to ignore.

261
0:12:59.983,000 --> 0:13:,000
Thank you.

262
0:13:01.158,000 --> 0:13:04,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Our grandparents' generation created an amazing system

2
0:00:16.6,000 --> 0:00:18,000
of canals and reservoirs that made it possible

3
0:00:19.2,000 --> 0:00:22,000
for people to live in places where there wasn't a lot of water.

4
0:00:22.64,000 --> 0:00:24,000
For example, during the Great Depression,

5
0:00:25.2,000 --> 0:00:26,000
they created the Hoover Dam,

6
0:00:26.84,000 --> 0:00:28,000
which in turn, created Lake Mead

7
0:00:29.28,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and made it possible for the cities of Las Vegas and Phoenix

8
0:00:32.92,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and Los Angeles to provide water

9
0:00:34.68,000 --> 0:00:36,000
for people who lived in a really dry place.

10
0:00:37.76,000 --> 0:00:4,000
In the 20th century, we literally spent trillions of dollars

11
0:00:41.68,000 --> 0:00:44,000
building infrastructure to get water to our cities.

12
0:00:45.12,000 --> 0:00:48,000
In terms of economic development, it was a great investment.

13
0:00:49.08,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But in the last decade, we've seen the combined effects

14
0:00:52.08,000 --> 0:00:57,000
of climate change, population growth and competition for water resources

15
0:00:57.88,000 --> 0:01:,000
threaten these vital lifelines and water resources.

16
0:01:01.56,000 --> 0:01:05,000
This figure shows you the change in the lake level of Lake Mead

17
0:01:05.72,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that happened in the last 15 years.

18
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
You can see starting around the year 2000,

19
0:01:10.36,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the lake level started to drop.

20
0:01:12.28,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And it was dropping at such a rate

21
0:01:14.12,000 --> 0:01:17,000
that it would have left the drinking water intakes for Las Vegas high and dry.

22
0:01:18.72,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The city became so concerned about this

23
0:01:21.48,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that they recently constructed a new drinking water intake structure

24
0:01:25.44,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that they referred to as the "Third Straw"

25
0:01:27.52,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to pull water out of the greater depths of the lake.

26
0:01:31.08,000 --> 0:01:34,000
The challenges associated with providing water to a modern city

27
0:01:34.76,000 --> 0:01:37,000
are not restricted to the American Southwest.

28
0:01:37.84,000 --> 0:01:42,000
In the year 2007, the third largest city in Australia, Brisbane,

29
0:01:43.2,000 --> 0:01:45,000
came within 6 months of running out of water.

30
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
A similar drama is playing out today in São Paulo, Brazil,

31
0:01:50.44,000 --> 0:01:51,000
where the main reservoir for the city

32
0:01:52.28,000 --> 0:01:54,000
has gone from being completely full in 2010,

33
0:01:55.2,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to being nearly empty today

34
0:01:57.4,000 --> 0:02:,000
as the city approaches the 2016 Summer Olympics.

35
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:04,000
For those of us who are fortunate enough

36
0:02:04.56,000 --> 0:02:06,000
to live in one of the world's great cities,

37
0:02:06.64,000 --> 0:02:1,000
we've never truly experienced the effects of a catastrophic drought.

38
0:02:10.8,000 --> 0:02:13,000
We like to complain about the navy showers we have to take.

39
0:02:14.56,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We like our neighbors to see our dirty cars and our brown lawns.

40
0:02:18.96,000 --> 0:02:21,000
But we've never really faced the prospect of turning on the tap

41
0:02:22.52,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and having nothing come out.

42
0:02:24.92,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And that's because when things have gotten bad in the past,

43
0:02:27.76,000 --> 0:02:3,000
it's always been possible to expand a reservoir

44
0:02:30.84,000 --> 0:02:32,000
or dig a few more groundwater wells.

45
0:02:34.08,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Well, in a time when all of the water resources are spoken for,

46
0:02:37.96,000 --> 0:02:4,000
it's not going to be possible to rely on this tried and true way

47
0:02:41.36,000 --> 0:02:43,000
of providing ourselves with water.

48
0:02:43.72,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Some people think that we're going to solve the urban water problem

49
0:02:47.52,000 --> 0:02:49,000
by taking water from our rural neighbors.

50
0:02:50.4,000 --> 0:02:56,000
But that's an approach that's fraught with political, legal and social dangers.

51
0:02:56.68,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And even if we succeed in grabbing the water from our rural neighbors,

52
0:03:00.24,000 --> 0:03:02,000
we're just transferring the problem to someone else

53
0:03:02.76,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and there's a good chance it will come back and bite us

54
0:03:05.4,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in the form of higher food prices

55
0:03:07.32,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and damage to the aquatic ecosystems that already rely upon that water.

56
0:03:12.2,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I think that there's a better way to solve our urban water crisis

57
0:03:15.6,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and I think that's to open up four new local sources of water

58
0:03:20.04,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that I liken to faucets.

59
0:03:21.8,000 --> 0:03:25,000
If we can make smart investments in these new sources of water

60
0:03:25.92,000 --> 0:03:26,000
in the coming years,

61
0:03:27.24,000 --> 0:03:29,000
we can solve our urban water problem

62
0:03:29.6,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and decrease the likelihood that we'll ever run across

63
0:03:32.96,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the effects of a catastrophic drought.

64
0:03:36.28,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now, if you told me 20 years ago

65
0:03:38.36,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that a modern city could exist without a supply of imported water,

66
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I probably would have dismissed you as an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer.

67
0:03:47.48,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But my own experiences

68
0:03:49.04,000 --> 0:03:53,000
working with some of the world's most water-starved cities in the last decades

69
0:03:53.44,000 --> 0:03:56,000
have shown me that we have the technologies and the management skills

70
0:03:57.4,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to actually transition away from imported water,

71
0:04:00.32,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and that's what I want to tell you about tonight.

72
0:04:03.24,000 --> 0:04:07,000
The first source of local water supply that we need to develop

73
0:04:07.64,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to solve our urban water problem

74
0:04:09.8,000 --> 0:04:12,000
will flow with the rainwater that falls in our cities.

75
0:04:13.08,000 --> 0:04:16,000
One of the great tragedies of urban development

76
0:04:16.52,000 --> 0:04:17,000
is that as our cities grew,

77
0:04:18.52,000 --> 0:04:21,000
we started covering all the surfaces with concrete and asphalt.

78
0:04:22.2,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And when we did that, we had to build storm sewers

79
0:04:24.64,000 --> 0:04:26,000
to get the water that fell on the cities out

80
0:04:26.76,000 --> 0:04:27,000
before it could cause flooding,

81
0:04:28.72,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and that's a waste of a vital water resource.

82
0:04:32.2,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Let me give you an example.

83
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:37,000
This figure here shows you the volume of water

84
0:04:37.24,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that could be collected in the city of San Jose

85
0:04:39.88,000 --> 0:04:42,000
if they could harvest the stormwater that fell within the city limits.

86
0:04:43.68,000 --> 0:04:47,000
You can see from the intersection of the blue line and the black dotted line

87
0:04:48.48,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that if San Jose could just capture half of the water that fell within the city,

88
0:04:52.8,000 --> 0:04:55,000
they'd have enough water to get them through an entire year.

89
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Now, I know what some of you are probably thinking.

90
0:04:58.8,000 --> 0:05:01,000
"The answer to our problem is to start building great big tanks

91
0:05:02.4,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and attaching them to the downspouts of our roof gutters,

92
0:05:05.28,000 --> 0:05:06,000
rainwater harvesting."

93
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Now, that's an idea that might work in some places.

94
0:05:09.6,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But if you live in a place where it mainly rains in the winter time

95
0:05:12.88,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and most of the water demand is in the summertime,

96
0:05:15.32,000 --> 0:05:18,000
it's not a very cost-effective way to solve a water problem.

97
0:05:19.08,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And if you experience the effects of a multiyear drought,

98
0:05:22.12,000 --> 0:05:24,000
like California's currently experiencing,

99
0:05:24.32,000 --> 0:05:28,000
you just can't build a rainwater tank that's big enough to solve your problem.

100
0:05:28.56,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I think there's a lot more practical way

101
0:05:30.6,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to harvest the stormwater and the rainwater that falls in our cities,

102
0:05:34.12,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and that's to capture it and let it percolate into the ground.

103
0:05:37.92,000 --> 0:05:42,000
After all, many of our cities are sitting on top of a natural water storage system

104
0:05:43.12,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that can accommodate huge volumes of water.

105
0:05:46.24,000 --> 0:05:49,000
For example, historically, Los Angeles has obtained

106
0:05:49.92,000 --> 0:05:52,000
about a third of its water supply from a massive aquifer

107
0:05:52.96,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that underlies the San Fernando Valley.

108
0:05:56.4,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Now, when you look at the water that comes off of your roof

109
0:05:59.2,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and runs off of your lawn and flows down the gutter,

110
0:06:01.68,000 --> 0:06:04,000
you might say to yourself, "Do I really want to drink that stuff?"

111
0:06:05.52,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Well, the answer is you don't want to drink it

112
0:06:07.72,000 --> 0:06:08,000
until it's been treated a little bit.

113
0:06:09.56,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And so the challenge that we face in urban water harvesting

114
0:06:12.68,000 --> 0:06:14,000
is to capture the water, clean the water

115
0:06:15.44,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and get it underground.

116
0:06:17.52,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And that's exactly what the city of Los Angeles is doing

117
0:06:20.56,000 --> 0:06:24,000
with a new project that they're building in Burbank, California.

118
0:06:24.68,000 --> 0:06:28,000
This figure here shows the stormwater park that they're building

119
0:06:28.8,000 --> 0:06:33,000
by hooking a series of stormwater collection systems, or storm sewers,

120
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and routing that water into an abandoned gravel quarry.

121
0:06:37.6,000 --> 0:06:38,000
The water that's captured in the quarry

122
0:06:39.52,000 --> 0:06:41,000
is slowly passed through a man-made wetland,

123
0:06:42.32,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and then it goes into that ball field there

124
0:06:44.96,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and percolates into the ground,

125
0:06:46.92,000 --> 0:06:48,000
recharging the drinking water aquifer of the city.

126
0:06:49.96,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And in the process of passing through the wetland

127
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and percolating through the ground,

128
0:06:54.8,000 --> 0:06:57,000
the water encounters microbes that live on the surfaces of the plants

129
0:06:58.32,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and the surfaces of the soil,

130
0:06:59.92,000 --> 0:07:,000
and that purifies the water.

131
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And if the water's still not clean enough to drink

132
0:07:04.56,000 --> 0:07:06,000
after it's been through this natural treatment process,

133
0:07:07.28,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the city can treat it again

134
0:07:08.64,000 --> 0:07:1,000
when they pump if back out of the groundwater aquifers

135
0:07:11.24,000 --> 0:07:13,000
before they deliver it to people to drink.

136
0:07:14.44,000 --> 0:07:18,000
The second tap that we need to open up to solve our urban water problem

137
0:07:18.84,000 --> 0:07:19,000
will flow with the wastewater

138
0:07:20.32,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that comes out of our sewage treatment plants.

139
0:07:23.36,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Now, many of you are probably familiar with the concept of recycled water.

140
0:07:26.861,000 --> 0:07:27,000
You've probably seen signs like this

141
0:07:28.76,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that tell you that the shrubbery and the highway median

142
0:07:32.04,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and the local golf course

143
0:07:33.56,000 --> 0:07:34,000
is being watered with water

144
0:07:35.44,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that used to be in a sewage treatment plant.

145
0:07:38.4,000 --> 0:07:4,000
We've been doing this for a couple of decades now.

146
0:07:41.36,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But what we're learning from our experience

147
0:07:43.4,000 --> 0:07:47,000
is that this approach is much more expensive that we expected it to be.

148
0:07:47.52,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Because once we build the first few water recycling systems

149
0:07:50.64,000 --> 0:07:51,000
close to the sewage treatment plant,

150
0:07:52.44,000 --> 0:07:54,000
we have to build longer and longer pipe networks

151
0:07:54.703,000 --> 0:07:56,000
to get that water to where it needs to go.

152
0:07:57.6,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And that becomes prohibitive in terms of cost.

153
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:02,000
What we're finding is

154
0:08:02.24,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that a much more cost-effective and practical way of recycling wastewater

155
0:08:06.28,000 --> 0:08:08,000
is to turn treated wastewater into drinking water

156
0:08:08.88,000 --> 0:08:09,000
through a two-step process.

157
0:08:11.08,000 --> 0:08:14,000
In the first step in this process we pressurize the water

158
0:08:14.24,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and pass it through a reverse osmosis membrane:

159
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:19,000
a thin, permeable plastic membrane

160
0:08:19.44,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that allows water molecules to pass through

161
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but traps and retains the salts, the viruses and the organic chemicals

162
0:08:26.8,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that might be present in the wastewater.

163
0:08:29.52,000 --> 0:08:3,000
In the second step in the process,

164
0:08:31.48,000 --> 0:08:33,000
we add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide

165
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and shine ultraviolet light on the water.

166
0:08:36.72,000 --> 0:08:38,000
The ultraviolet light cleaves the hydrogen peroxide

167
0:08:39.64,000 --> 0:08:42,000
into two parts that are called hydroxyl radicals,

168
0:08:42.8,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and these hydroxyl radicals are very potent forms of oxygen

169
0:08:46.919,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that break down most organic chemicals.

170
0:08:50.12,000 --> 0:08:53,000
After the water's been through this two-stage process,

171
0:08:53.2,000 --> 0:08:54,000
it's safe to drink.

172
0:08:54.84,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I know,

173
0:08:56.12,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I've been studying recycled water

174
0:08:58.72,000 --> 0:09:01,000
using every measurement technique known to modern science

175
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
for the past 15 years.

176
0:09:04.32,000 --> 0:09:05,000
We've detected some chemicals

177
0:09:05.76,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that can make it through the first step in the process,

178
0:09:08.36,000 --> 0:09:1,000
but by the time we get to the second step,

179
0:09:10.384,000 --> 0:09:11,000
the advanced oxidation process,

180
0:09:12.32,000 --> 0:09:14,000
we rarely see any chemicals present.

181
0:09:14.76,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And that's in stark contrast to the taken-for-granted water supplies

182
0:09:18.96,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that we regularly drink all the time.

183
0:09:22.04,000 --> 0:09:24,000
There's another way we can recycle water.

184
0:09:24.44,000 --> 0:09:27,000
This is an engineered treatment wetland that we recently built

185
0:09:27.56,000 --> 0:09:29,000
on the Santa Ana River in Southern California.

186
0:09:30.36,000 --> 0:09:34,000
The treatment wetland receives water from a part of the Santa Ana River

187
0:09:34.48,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that in the summertime consists almost entirely of wastewater effluent

188
0:09:38.12,000 --> 0:09:41,000
from cities like Riverside and San Bernardino.

189
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
The water comes into our treatment wetland,

190
0:09:43.24,000 --> 0:09:45,000
it's exposed to sunlight and algae

191
0:09:45.6,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and those break down the organic chemicals,

192
0:09:48.12,000 --> 0:09:51,000
remove the nutrients and inactivate the waterborne pathogens.

193
0:09:51.68,000 --> 0:09:53,000
The water gets put back in the Santa Ana River,

194
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
it flows down to Anaheim,

195
0:09:56.08,000 --> 0:09:59,000
gets taken out at Anaheim and percolated into the ground,

196
0:09:59.36,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and becomes the drinking water of the city of Anaheim,

197
0:10:02.04,000 --> 0:10:05,000
completing the trip from the sewers of Riverside County

198
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:08,000
to the drinking water supply of Orange County.

199
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Now, you might think that this idea of drinking wastewater

200
0:10:13.44,000 --> 0:10:16,000
is some sort of futuristic fantasy or not commonly done.

201
0:10:16.88,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Well, in California, we already recycle about 40 billion gallons a year

202
0:10:21.28,000 --> 0:10:24,000
of wastewater through the two-stage advanced treatment process

203
0:10:24.4,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I was telling you about.

204
0:10:25.72,000 --> 0:10:28,000
That's enough water to be the supply of about a million people

205
0:10:29.48,000 --> 0:10:3,000
if it were their sole water supply.

206
0:10:32.28,000 --> 0:10:36,000
The third tap that we need to open up will not be a tap at all,

207
0:10:36.52,000 --> 0:10:37,000
it will be a kind of virtual tap,

208
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
it will be the water conservation that we manage to do.

209
0:10:41.28,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And the place where we need to think about water conservation is outdoors

210
0:10:44.76,000 --> 0:10:47,000
because in California and other modern American cities,

211
0:10:48.4,000 --> 0:10:5,000
about half of our water use happens outdoors.

212
0:10:51.76,000 --> 0:10:52,000
In the current drought,

213
0:10:53.24,000 --> 0:10:54,000
we've seen that it's possible

214
0:10:54.84,000 --> 0:10:56,000
to have our lawns survive and our plants survive

215
0:10:57.84,000 --> 0:10:58,000
with about half as much water.

216
0:10:59.76,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So there's no need to start painting concrete green

217
0:11:02.8,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and putting in Astroturf and buying cactuses.

218
0:11:05.92,000 --> 0:11:09,000
We can have California-friendly landscaping with soil moisture detectors

219
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and smart irrigation controllers

220
0:11:12.08,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and have beautiful green landscapes in our cities.

221
0:11:15.76,000 --> 0:11:18,000
The fourth and final water tap that we need to open up

222
0:11:18.8,000 --> 0:11:19,000
to solve our urban water problem

223
0:11:20.72,000 --> 0:11:22,000
will flow with desalinated seawater.

224
0:11:23.36,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Now, I know what you probably heard people say about seawater desalination.

225
0:11:27.36,000 --> 0:11:31,000
"It's a great thing to do if you have lots of oil, not a lot of water

226
0:11:31.56,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and you don't care about climate change."

227
0:11:33.96,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Seawater desalination is energy-intensive no matter how you slice it.

228
0:11:38.32,000 --> 0:11:4,000
But that characterization of seawater desalination

229
0:11:40.96,000 --> 0:11:43,000
as being a nonstarter is hopelessly out of date.

230
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:46,000
We've made tremendous progress in seawater desalination

231
0:11:46.8,000 --> 0:11:47,000
in the past two decades.

232
0:11:48.92,000 --> 0:11:49,000
This picture shows you

233
0:11:50.6,000 --> 0:11:53,000
the largest seawater desalination plant in the Western hemisphere

234
0:11:54.6,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that's currently being built north of San Diego.

235
0:11:57.44,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Compared to the seawater desalination plant

236
0:11:59.72,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that was built in Santa Barbara 25 years ago,

237
0:12:03.04,000 --> 0:12:05,000
this treatment plant will use about half the energy

238
0:12:05.72,000 --> 0:12:06,000
to produce a gallon of water.

239
0:12:07.84,000 --> 0:12:1,000
But just because seawater desalination has become less energy-intensive,

240
0:12:11.6,000 --> 0:12:14,000
doesn't mean we should start building desalination plants everywhere.

241
0:12:14.863,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Among the different choices we have,

242
0:12:16.623,000 --> 0:12:18,000
it's probably the most energy-intensive

243
0:12:18.76,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and potentially environmentally damaging

244
0:12:20.72,000 --> 0:12:22,000
of the options to create a local water supply.

245
0:12:24.56,000 --> 0:12:25,000
So there it is.

246
0:12:25.8,000 --> 0:12:26,000
With these four sources of water,

247
0:12:27.6,000 --> 0:12:3,000
we can move away from our reliance on imported water.

248
0:12:31.68,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Through reform in the way we landscape our surfaces and our properties,

249
0:12:36.2,000 --> 0:12:39,000
we can reduce outdoor water use by about 50 percent,

250
0:12:39.32,000 --> 0:12:42,000
thereby increasing the water supply by 25 percent.

251
0:12:42.8,000 --> 0:12:44,000
We can recycle the water that makes it into the sewer,

252
0:12:45.348,000 --> 0:12:48,000
thereby increasing our water supply by 40 percent.

253
0:12:48.88,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And we can make up the difference through a combination

254
0:12:51.52,000 --> 0:12:53,000
of stormwater harvesting and seawater desalination.

255
0:12:55.28,000 --> 0:12:58,000
So, let's create a water supply

256
0:12:59.12,000 --> 0:13:02,000
that will be able to withstand any of the challenges

257
0:13:02.8,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that climate change throws at us in the coming years.

258
0:13:05.4,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Let's create a water supply that uses local sources

259
0:13:08.76,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and leaves more water in the environment for fish and for food.

260
0:13:13.64,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Let's create a water system that's consistent with out environmental values.

261
0:13:18.68,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And let's do it for our children and our grandchildren

262
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and let's tell them this is the system

263
0:13:24.8,000 --> 0:13:26,000
that they have to take care of in the future

264
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
because it's our last chance to create a new kind of water system.

265
0:13:31.12,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Thank you very much for your attention.

266
0:13:33.002,000 --> 0:13:35,000
(Applause)

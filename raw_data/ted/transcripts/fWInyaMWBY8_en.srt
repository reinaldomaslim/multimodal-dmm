1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
What do I know

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that would cause me,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
a reticent, Midwestern scientist,

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
to get myself arrested

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in front of the White House protesting?

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And what would you do

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
if you knew what I know?

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Let's start with how I got to this point.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I was lucky to grow up

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
at a time when it was not difficult

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
for the child of a tenant farmer

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
to make his way to the state university.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And I was really lucky

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to go to the University of Iowa

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
where I could study under Professor James Van Allen

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
who built instruments

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
for the first U.S. satellites.

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Professor Van Allen told me

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
about observations of Venus,

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that there was intense microwave radiation.

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere?

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Or was Venus extremely hot?

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
The right answer,

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
confirmed by the Soviet Venera spacecraft,

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
was that Venus was very hot --

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
900 degrees Fahrenheit.

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And it was kept hot

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere.

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I was fortunate to join NASA

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and successfully propose

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
an experiment to fly to Venus.

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Our instrument took this image

33
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
of the veil of Venus,

34
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
which turned out to be

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
a smog of sulfuric acid.

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But while our instrument was being built,

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I became involved in calculations

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
of the greenhouse effect

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
here on Earth,

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
because we realized

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that our atmospheric composition was changing.

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Eventually, I resigned

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
as principal investigator

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
on our Venus experiment

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
because a planet changing before our eyes

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
is more interesting and important.

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Its changes will affect all of humanity.

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
The greenhouse effect had been well understood

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
for more than a century.

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
British physicist John Tyndall,

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
in the 1850's,

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
made laboratory measurements

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
of the infrared radiation,

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
which is heat.

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And he showed that gasses such as CO2 absorb heat,

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
thus acting like a blanket

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
warming Earth's surface.

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I worked with other scientists

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to analyze Earth climate observations.

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
In 1981,

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
we published an article in Science magazine

62
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
concluding that observed warming

63
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
of 0.4 degrees Celsius

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
in the prior century

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
was consistent with the greenhouse effect

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
of increasing CO2.

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
That Earth would likely warm in the 1980's,

68
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and warming would exceed

69
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
the noise level of random weather

70
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
by the end of the century.

71
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We also said that the 21st century

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
would see shifting climate zones,

73
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
creation of drought-prone regions

74
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in North America and Asia,

75
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
erosion of ice sheets, rising sea levels

76
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage.

77
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
All of these impacts

78
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
have since either happened

79
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
or are now well under way.

80
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
That paper was reported on the front page of the New York Times

81
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and led to me testifying to Congress

82
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
in the 1980's,

83
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
testimony in which I emphasized

84
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that global warming increases both extremes

85
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
of the Earth's water cycle.

86
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Heatwaves and droughts on one hand,

87
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
directly from the warming,

88
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
but also, because a warmer atmosphere

89
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
holds more water vapor

90
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
with its latent energy,

91
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
rainfall will become

92
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
in more extreme events.

93
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
There will be stronger storms and greater flooding.

94
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Global warming hoopla

95
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
became time-consuming

96
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and distracted me from doing science --

97
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
partly because I had complained

98
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that the White House altered my testimony.

99
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So I decided to go back

100
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to strictly doing science

101
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and leave the communication to others.

102
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
By 15 years later,

103
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
evidence of global warming was much stronger.

104
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper

105
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
were facts.

106
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I had the privilege to speak twice

107
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to the president's climate task force.

108
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But energy policies continued to focus

109
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
on finding more fossil fuels.

110
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
By then we had two grandchildren,

111
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Sophie and Connor.

112
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I decided

113
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that I did not want them in the future

114
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to say, "Opa understood what was happening,

115
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
but he didn't make it clear."

116
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So I decided to give a public talk

117
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy.

118
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I gave the talk at the University of Iowa in 2004

119
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and at the 2005 meeting

120
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
of the American Geophysical Union.

121
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
This led to calls

122
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
from the White House to NASA headquarters

123
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and I was told that I could not give any talks or speak with the media

124
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
without prior explicit approval

125
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
by NASA headquarters.

126
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
After I informed the New York Times

127
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
about these restrictions,

128
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
NASA was forced to end the censorship.

129
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But there were consequences.

130
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I had been using the first line

131
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
of the NASA mission statement,

132
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
"To understand and protect the home planet,"

133
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to justify my talks.

134
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Soon the first line of the mission statement

135
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
was deleted, never to appear again.

136
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Over the next few years

137
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I was drawn more and more

138
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
into trying to communicate the urgency

139
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
of a change in energy policies,

140
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
while still researching the physics of climate change.

141
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
Let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics --

142
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
first, from Earth's energy balance

143
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and, second, from Earth's climate history.

144
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Adding CO2 to the air

145
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
is like throwing another blanket on the bed.

146
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It reduces Earth's heat radiation to space,

147
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
so there's a temporary energy imbalance.

148
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
More energy is coming in

149
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
than going out,

150
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
until Earth warms up enough

151
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to again radiate to space

152
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
as much energy as it absorbs from the Sun.

153
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So the key quantity

154
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
is Earth's energy imbalance.

155
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Is there more energy coming in

156
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
than going out?

157
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
If so, more warming is in the pipeline.

158
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses.

159
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Now finally,

160
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
we can measure Earth's energy imbalance precisely

161
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
by measuring the heat content

162
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
in Earth's heat reservoirs.

163
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
The biggest reservoir, the ocean, was the least well measured,

164
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
until more than 3,000 Argo floats

165
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
were distributed around the world's ocean.

166
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
These floats reveal

167
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that the upper half of the ocean

168
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
is gaining heat at a substantial rate.

169
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate,

170
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and energy is going

171
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
into the net melting of ice all around the planet.

172
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And the land, to depths of tens of meters,

173
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
is also warming.

174
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
The total energy imbalance now

175
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
is about six-tenths of a watt per square meter.

176
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
That may not sound like much,

177
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but when added up over the whole world, it's enormous.

178
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It's about 20 times greater

179
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
than the rate of energy use by all of humanity.

180
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
It's equivalent to exploding

181
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day

182
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
365 days per year.

183
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
That's how much extra energy

184
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Earth is gaining each day.

185
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
This imbalance,

186
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
if we want to stabilize climate,

187
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
means that we must reduce CO2

188
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
from 391 ppm, parts per million,

189
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
back to 350 ppm.

190
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
That is the change needed to restore energy balance

191
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and prevent further warming.

192
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Climate change deniers argue

193
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that the Sun is the main cause of climate change.

194
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But the measured energy imbalance occurred

195
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
during the deepest solar minimum in the record,

196
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
when the Sun's energy reaching Earth was least.

197
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Yet, there was more energy coming in than going out.

198
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
This shows that the effect of the Sun's variations on climate

199
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses,

200
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
mainly from burning fossil fuels.

201
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Now consider Earth's climate history.

202
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
These curves for global temperature,

203
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
atmospheric CO2 and sea level

204
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
were derived from ocean cores and Antarctic ice cores,

205
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
from ocean sediments and snowflakes

206
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
that piled up year after year

207
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
over 800,000 years

208
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
forming a two-mile thick ice sheet.

209
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
As you see, there's a high correlation

210
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
between temperature, CO2 and sea level.

211
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Careful examination shows

212
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that the temperature changes

213
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
slightly lead the CO2 changes

214
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
by a few centuries.

215
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Climate change deniers like to use this fact

216
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to confuse and trick the public

217
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
by saying, "Look, the temperature causes CO2 to change,

218
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
not vice versa."

219
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
But that lag

220
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
is exactly what is expected.

221
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Small changes in Earth's orbit

222
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years

223
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
alter the distribution

224
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
of sunlight on Earth.

225
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
When there is more sunlight

226
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
at high latitudes in summer, ice sheets melt.

227
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Shrinking ice sheets

228
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
make the planet darker,

229
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
so it absorbs more sunlight

230
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and becomes warmer.

231
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
A warmer ocean releases CO2,

232
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
just as a warm Coca-Cola does.

233
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And more CO2 causes more warming.

234
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So CO2, methane, and ice sheets

235
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
were feedbacks

236
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
that amplified global temperature change

237
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge,

238
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
even though the climate change was initiated

239
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
by a very weak forcing.

240
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
The important point

241
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
is that these same amplifying feedbacks

242
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
will occur today.

243
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
The physics does not change.

244
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
As Earth warms,

245
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
now because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere,

246
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
ice will melt,

247
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and CO2 and methane will be released

248
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
by warming ocean and melting permafrost.

249
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
While we can't say exactly how fast

250
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
these amplifying feedbacks will occur,

251
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
it is certain they will occur,

252
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
unless we stop the warming.

253
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
There is evidence

254
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that feedbacks are already beginning.

255
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
Precise measurements

256
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
by GRACE, the gravity satellite,

257
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica

258
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
are now losing mass,

259
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
several hundred cubic kilometers per year.

260
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And the rate has accelerated

261
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
since the measurements began

262
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
nine years ago.

263
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Methane is also beginning

264
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
to escape from the permafrost.

265
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
What sea level rise

266
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
can we look forward to?

267
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
The last time CO2 was 390 ppm,

268
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
today's value,

269
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
sea level was higher

270
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
by at least 15 meters, 50 feet.

271
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Where you are sitting now

272
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
would be under water.

273
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Most estimates are that, this century,

274
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
we will get at least one meter.

275
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I think it will be more

276
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
if we keep burning fossil fuels,

277
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
perhaps even five meters, which is 18 feet,

278
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
this century or shortly thereafter.

279
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
The important point

280
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
is that we will have started a process

281
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that is out of humanity's control.

282
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries.

283
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
There would be no stable shoreline.

284
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
The economic consequences are almost unthinkable.

285
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Hundreds of New Orleans-like devastations

286
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
around the world.

287
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
What may be more reprehensible,

288
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
if climate denial continues,

289
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
is extermination of species.

290
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
The monarch butterfly

291
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
could be one of the 20 to 50 percent of all species

292
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates

293
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
will be ticketed for extinction

294
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
by the end of the century

295
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
if we stay on business-as-usual fossil fuel use.

296
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Global warming is already affecting people.

297
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
The Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico

298
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
heatwave and drought last year,

299
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Moscow the year before

300
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and Europe in 2003,

301
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
were all exceptional events,

302
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
more than three standard deviations outside the norm.

303
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Fifty years ago,

304
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
such anomalies

305
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
covered only two- to three-tenths

306
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
of one percent of the land area.

307
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
In recent years,

308
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
because of global warming,

309
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
they now cover about 10 percent --

310
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
an increase by a factor of 25 to 50.

311
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So we can say with a high degree of confidence

312
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
that the severe Texas and Moscow heatwaves

313
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
were not natural;

314
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
they were caused by global warming.

315
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
An important impact,

316
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
if global warming continues,

317
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world,

318
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
the Midwest and Great Plains,

319
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts,

320
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
worse than the Dust Bowl,

321
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
within just a few decades,

322
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
if we let global warming continue.

323
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
How did I get dragged deeper and deeper

324
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
into an attempt to communicate,

325
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
giving talks in 10 countries, getting arrested,

326
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
burning up the vacation time

327
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
that I had accumulated over 30 years?

328
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
More grandchildren helped me along.

329
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Jake is a super-positive,

330
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
enthusiastic boy.

331
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Here at age two and a half years,

332
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
he thinks he can protect

333
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
his two and a half-day-old little sister.

334
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
It would be immoral

335
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
to leave these young people

336
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
with a climate system

337
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
spiraling out of control.

338
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Now the tragedy about climate change

339
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
is that we can solve it

340
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
with a simple, honest approach

341
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
of a gradually rising carbon fee

342
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
collected from fossil fuel companies

343
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and distributed 100 percent electronically

344
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
every month to all legal residents

345
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
on a per capita basis,

346
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
with the government not keeping one dime.

347
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Most people would get more in the monthly dividend

348
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
than they'd pay in increased prices.

349
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
This fee and dividend

350
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
would stimulate the economy

351
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and innovations,

352
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
creating millions of jobs.

353
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
It is the principal requirement

354
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
for moving us rapidly

355
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
to a clean energy future.

356
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Several top economists

357
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
are coauthors on this proposition.

358
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Jim DiPeso of Republicans for Environmental Protection

359
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
describes it thusly:

360
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
"Transparent. Market-based.

361
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Does not enlarge government.

362
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Leaves energy decisions to individual choices.

363
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Sounds like a conservative climate plan."

364
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
But instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions

365
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
to make fossil fuels pay

366
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
their true cost to society,

367
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
our governments are forcing the public

368
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
to subsidize fossil fuels

369
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
by 400 to 500 billion dollars

370
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
per year worldwide,

371
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel --

372
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
mountaintop removal,

373
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
longwall mining, fracking,

374
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
tar sands, tar shale,

375
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
deep ocean Arctic drilling.

376
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
This path, if continued,

377
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
guarantees that we will pass tipping points

378
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
leading to ice sheet disintegration

379
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
that will accelerate out of control of future generations.

380
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
A large fraction of species

381
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
will be committed to extinction.

382
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And increasing intensity of droughts and floods

383
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
will severely impact breadbaskets of the world,

384
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
causing massive famines

385
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and economic decline.

386
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Imagine a giant asteroid

387
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
on a direct collision course with Earth.

388
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
That is the equivalent

389
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
of what we face now.

390
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Yet, we dither,

391
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
taking no action

392
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
to divert the asteroid,

393
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
even though the longer we wait,

394
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
the more difficult and expensive it becomes.

395
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
If we had started in 2005,

396
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
it would have required emission reductions of three percent per year

397
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
to restore planetary energy balance

398
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
and stabilize climate this century.

399
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
If we start next year,

400
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
it is six percent per year.

401
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
If we wait 10 years, it is 15 percent per year --

402
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
extremely difficult and expensive,

403
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
perhaps impossible.

404
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
But we aren't even starting.

405
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
So now you know what I know

406
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
that is moving me to sound this alarm.

407
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Clearly, I haven't gotten this message across.

408
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
The science is clear.

409
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
I need your help

410
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
to communicate the gravity and the urgency

411
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
of this situation

412
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and its solutions

413
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
more effectively.

414
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
We owe it to our children and grandchildren.

415
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
Thank you.

416
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
(Applause)

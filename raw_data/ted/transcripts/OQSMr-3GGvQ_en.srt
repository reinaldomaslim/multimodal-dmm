1
0:00:13.27,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So, on the day after the Brexit vote,

2
0:00:16.198,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in June 2016,

3
0:00:19.175,000 --> 0:00:2,000
when Britain woke up to the shock

4
0:00:21.196,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of discovering that we're leaving the European Union,

5
0:00:24.149,000 --> 0:00:26,000
my editor at the "Observer" newspaper in the UK

6
0:00:27.006,000 --> 0:00:31,000
asked me to go back to South Wales, where I grew up, and to write a report.

7
0:00:32.075,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And so I went to a town called Ebbw Vale.

8
0:00:35.178,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Here it is.

9
0:00:36.479,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It's in the South Wales Valleys, which is this quite special place.

10
0:00:40.133,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So it's had this very, sort of rich, working-class culture,

11
0:00:45.046,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and it's famous for its Welsh male voice choirs and rugby and its coal.

12
0:00:50.209,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But when I was a teenager, the coal mines and the steelworks closed,

13
0:00:54.677,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and the entire area was devastated.

14
0:00:57.78,000 --> 0:01:,000
And I went there because it had one of the highest "Leave" votes in the country.

15
0:01:01.774,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Sixty-two percent of the people here voted to leave the European Union.

16
0:01:06.671,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And I wanted to know why.

17
0:01:09.624,000 --> 0:01:11,000
When I got there, I was just a bit taken aback,

18
0:01:11.87,000 --> 0:01:13,000
because the last time I went to Ebbw Vale,

19
0:01:14.371,000 --> 0:01:15,000
it looked like this.

20
0:01:16.584,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And now, it looks like this.

21
0:01:19.521,000 --> 0:01:23,000
This is a new 33-million-pound college of further education

22
0:01:24.466,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that was mostly funded by the European Union.

23
0:01:28.598,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And this is the new sports center

24
0:01:31.693,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that's at the middle of 350-million-pound regeneration project

25
0:01:36.836,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that's being funded by the European Union.

26
0:01:40.805,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And this is the new 77-million-pound road-improvement scheme,

27
0:01:44.654,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and there's a new train line, a new railway station,

28
0:01:47.146,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and they're all being funded by the European Union.

29
0:01:49.574,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And it's not as if any of this is a secret,

30
0:01:51.612,000 --> 0:01:53,000
because there's big signs like this everywhere.

31
0:01:53.867,000 --> 0:01:54,000
[EU Funds: Investing in Wales]

32
0:01:55.348,000 --> 0:01:56,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:57.542,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I had this sort of weird sense of unreality,

34
0:01:59.824,000 --> 0:02:,000
walking around the town.

35
0:02:01.654,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And it came to a head

36
0:02:03.07,000 --> 0:02:06,000
when I met this young man in front of the sports center.

37
0:02:07.482,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And he told me that he had voted to leave,

38
0:02:11.141,000 --> 0:02:15,000
because the European Union had done nothing for him.

39
0:02:17.657,000 --> 0:02:18,000
He was fed up with it.

40
0:02:19.736,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And all around town, people told me the same thing.

41
0:02:23.895,000 --> 0:02:25,000
They said that they wanted to take back control,

42
0:02:26.673,000 --> 0:02:28,000
which was one of the slogans in the campaign.

43
0:02:29.665,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And they told me that they were most fed up

44
0:02:31.934,000 --> 0:02:33,000
with the immigrants and with the refugees.

45
0:02:34.244,000 --> 0:02:35,000
They'd had enough.

46
0:02:36.847,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Which was odd.

47
0:02:38.292,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Because walking around, I didn't meet any immigrants or refugees.

48
0:02:41.616,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I met one Polish woman who told me

49
0:02:43.316,000 --> 0:02:45,000
she was practically the only foreigner in town.

50
0:02:45.561,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And when I checked the figures,

51
0:02:47.227,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I discovered that Ebbw Vale actually has

52
0:02:49.332,000 --> 0:02:52,000
one of the lowest rates of immigration in the country.

53
0:02:53.395,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And so I was just a bit baffled,

54
0:02:54.998,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because I couldn't really understand

55
0:02:56.752,000 --> 0:02:58,000
where people were getting their information from.

56
0:02:59.093,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Because it was the right-wing tabloid newspapers

57
0:03:01.371,000 --> 0:03:03,000
which printed all these stories about immigration.

58
0:03:03.768,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And this is a very much left-wing Labour stronghold.

59
0:03:08.006,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But then after the article came out, this woman got in touch with me.

60
0:03:11.585,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And she was from Ebbw Vale,

61
0:03:13.829,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and she told me about all this stuff that she'd seen on Facebook.

62
0:03:16.916,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I was like, "What stuff?"

63
0:03:18.146,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And she said it was all this quite scary stuff about immigration,

64
0:03:21.276,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and especially about Turkey.

65
0:03:22.673,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So I tried to find it.

66
0:03:24.378,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But there was nothing there.

67
0:03:26.507,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Because there's no archive of ads that people had seen

68
0:03:30.404,000 --> 0:03:32,000
or what had been pushed into their news feeds.

69
0:03:34.491,000 --> 0:03:36,000
No trace of anything, gone completely dark.

70
0:03:38.956,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And this referendum that will have this profound effect forever on Britain --

71
0:03:44.845,000 --> 0:03:46,000
it's already had a profound effect:

72
0:03:47.187,000 --> 0:03:5,000
the Japanese car manufacturers that came to Wales and the north east

73
0:03:50.427,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to replace the mining jobs --

74
0:03:51.885,000 --> 0:03:52,000
they are already going because of Brexit.

75
0:03:54.316,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And this entire referendum took place in darkness,

76
0:03:59.244,000 --> 0:04:02,000
because it took place on Facebook.

77
0:04:03.974,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And what happens on Facebook stays on Facebook,

78
0:04:08.005,000 --> 0:04:11,000
because only you see your news feed, and then it vanishes,

79
0:04:11.196,000 --> 0:04:13,000
so it's impossible to research anything.

80
0:04:13.434,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So we have no idea who saw what ads

81
0:04:16.212,000 --> 0:04:18,000
or what impact they had,

82
0:04:18.482,000 --> 0:04:2,000
or what data was used to target these people.

83
0:04:21.323,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Or even who placed the ads, or how much money was spent,

84
0:04:24.6,000 --> 0:04:26,000
or even what nationality they were.

85
0:04:28.617,000 --> 0:04:29,000
But Facebook does.

86
0:04:31.291,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Facebook has these answers,

87
0:04:33.688,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and it's refused to give them to us.

88
0:04:36.911,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Our parliament has asked Mark Zuckerberg multiple times to come to Britain

89
0:04:41.601,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and to give us these answers.

90
0:04:43.442,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And every single time, he's refused.

91
0:04:47.244,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And you have to wonder why.

92
0:04:50.125,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Because what I and other journalists have uncovered

93
0:04:53.165,000 --> 0:04:56,000
is that multiple crimes took place during the referendum.

94
0:04:56.831,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And they took place on Facebook.

95
0:05:00.966,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It's because in Britain, we limit the amount of money

96
0:05:03.498,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that you can spend in an election.

97
0:05:05.902,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And it's because in the 19th century,

98
0:05:07.852,000 --> 0:05:1,000
people would walk around with literally wheelbarrows of cash

99
0:05:11.196,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and just buy voters.

100
0:05:13.617,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So we passed these strict laws to stop that from happening.

101
0:05:18.257,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But those laws don't work anymore.

102
0:05:20.663,000 --> 0:05:23,000
This referendum took place almost entirely online.

103
0:05:24.282,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And you can spend any amount of money on Facebook or on Google or on YouTube ads

104
0:05:28.891,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and nobody will know, because they're black boxes.

105
0:05:31.617,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And this is what happened.

106
0:05:34.22,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We've actually got no idea of the full extent of it.

107
0:05:37.046,000 --> 0:05:4,000
But we do know that in the last days before the Brexit vote,

108
0:05:40.191,000 --> 0:05:42,000
the official "Vote Leave" campaign

109
0:05:42.588,000 --> 0:05:46,000
laundered nearly three quarters of a million pounds

110
0:05:46.691,000 --> 0:05:49,000
through another campaign entity

111
0:05:49.792,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that our electoral commission has ruled was illegal,

112
0:05:52.871,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and it's referred it to the police.

113
0:05:55.315,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And with this illegal cash,

114
0:05:59.737,000 --> 0:06:04,000
"Vote Leave" unleashed a fire hose of disinformation.

115
0:06:05.503,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Ads like this.

116
0:06:06.71,000 --> 0:06:07,000
[Turkey's 76m people joining the EU]

117
0:06:08.495,000 --> 0:06:09,000
This is a lie, it's a total lie.

118
0:06:10.153,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Turkey is not joining the European Union.

119
0:06:12.559,000 --> 0:06:17,000
There's not even any discussions of it joining the European Union.

120
0:06:17.793,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And most of us, we never saw these ads,

121
0:06:20.254,000 --> 0:06:22,000
because we were not the target of them.

122
0:06:22.944,000 --> 0:06:25,000
"Vote Leave" identified a tiny sliver of people

123
0:06:26.649,000 --> 0:06:28,000
who it identified as persuadable, and they saw them.

124
0:06:29.522,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And the only reason we are seeing these now

125
0:06:32.006,000 --> 0:06:36,000
is because parliament forced Facebook to hand them over.

126
0:06:37.587,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And maybe you think,

127
0:06:38.785,000 --> 0:06:39,000
"Well, it was just a bit of overspending.

128
0:06:40.77,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It's a few lies."

129
0:06:42.611,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But this was the biggest electoral fraud in Britain for 100 years.

130
0:06:49.405,000 --> 0:06:52,000
In a once-in-a-generation vote

131
0:06:52.698,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that hinged upon just one percent of the electorate.

132
0:06:59.075,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And it was just one of the crimes that took place in the referendum.

133
0:07:03.027,000 --> 0:07:04,000
There was another group,

134
0:07:04.594,000 --> 0:07:07,000
which was headed by this man, Nigel Farage,

135
0:07:09.522,000 --> 0:07:1,000
the one to the right of Trump.

136
0:07:11.76,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And his group, "Leave.EU" -- it also broke the law.

137
0:07:15.672,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It broke British electoral laws and British data laws,

138
0:07:18.966,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and it's also being referred to the police.

139
0:07:22.879,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And this man, Arron Banks, he funded this campaign.

140
0:07:27.696,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And in a completely separate case,

141
0:07:30.458,000 --> 0:07:33,000
he's being referred to our National Crime Agency,

142
0:07:34.458,000 --> 0:07:36,000
our equivalent of the FBI,

143
0:07:36.656,000 --> 0:07:38,000
because our electoral commission

144
0:07:38.681,000 --> 0:07:41,000
has concluded they don't know where his money came from.

145
0:07:41.743,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Or if it was even British.

146
0:07:44.712,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And I'm not even going to go into the lies that Arron Banks has told

147
0:07:49.706,000 --> 0:07:52,000
about his covert relationship with the Russian government.

148
0:07:54.545,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Or the weird timing of Nigel Farage's meetings with Julian Assange

149
0:07:58.68,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and with Trump's buddy, Roger Stone, now indicted,

150
0:08:01.8,000 --> 0:08:04,000
immediately before two massive WikiLeaks dumps,

151
0:08:05.244,000 --> 0:08:07,000
both of which happened to benefit Donald Trump.

152
0:08:07.974,000 --> 0:08:11,000
But I will tell you that Brexit and Trump were intimately entwined.

153
0:08:12.773,000 --> 0:08:16,000
This man told me that Brexit was the petri dish for Trump.

154
0:08:18.099,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And we know it's the same people, the same companies,

155
0:08:20.634,000 --> 0:08:21,000
the same data, the same techniques,

156
0:08:22.34,000 --> 0:08:23,000
the same use of hate and fear.

157
0:08:24.188,000 --> 0:08:26,000
This is what they were posting on Facebook.

158
0:08:27.538,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And I don't even want to call this a lie,

159
0:08:30.221,000 --> 0:08:32,000
[Immigration without assimilation equals invasion]

160
0:08:32.627,000 --> 0:08:34,000
because it feels more like a hate crime to me.

161
0:08:38.033,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I don't have to tell you

162
0:08:40.072,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that hate and fear are being sown online all across the world.

163
0:08:46.45,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Not just in Britain and America, but in France and in Hungary

164
0:08:49.586,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and Brazil and Myanmar and New Zealand.

165
0:08:52.751,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And we know there is this dark undertow which is connecting us all globally.

166
0:08:57.973,000 --> 0:09:,000
And it is flowing via the technology platforms.

167
0:09:02.314,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But we only see a tiny amount of what's going on on the surface.

168
0:09:07.244,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And I only found out anything about this dark underbelly

169
0:09:12.125,000 --> 0:09:14,000
because I started looking into Trump's relationship to Farage,

170
0:09:15.063,000 --> 0:09:17,000
into a company called Cambridge Analytica.

171
0:09:18.853,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And I spent months tracking down an ex-employee, Christopher Wiley.

172
0:09:23.777,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And he told me how this company, that worked for both Trump and Brexit,

173
0:09:28.722,000 --> 0:09:3,000
had profiled people politically

174
0:09:31.664,000 --> 0:09:35,000
in order to understand their individual fears,

175
0:09:35.815,000 --> 0:09:38,000
to better target them with Facebook ads.

176
0:09:39.87,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And it did this by illicitly harvesting the profiles

177
0:09:44.868,000 --> 0:09:47,000
of 87 million people from Facebook.

178
0:09:50.2,000 --> 0:09:55,000
It took an entire year's work to get Christopher on the record.

179
0:09:55.243,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And I had to turn myself from a feature writer

180
0:09:57.496,000 --> 0:09:59,000
into an investigative reporter to do it.

181
0:10:00.483,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And he was extraordinarily brave,

182
0:10:02.102,000 --> 0:10:05,000
because the company is owned by Robert Mercer,

183
0:10:05.879,000 --> 0:10:06,000
the billionaire who bankrolled Trump,

184
0:10:07.72,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and he threatened to sue us multiple times,

185
0:10:10.977,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to stop us from publishing.

186
0:10:13.077,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But we finally got there, and we were one day ahead of publication.

187
0:10:16.831,000 --> 0:10:17,000
We got another legal threat.

188
0:10:19.329,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Not from Cambridge Analytica this time,

189
0:10:21.227,000 --> 0:10:22,000
but from Facebook.

190
0:10:24.416,000 --> 0:10:27,000
It told us that if we publish, they would sue us.

191
0:10:28.86,000 --> 0:10:29,000
We did it anyway.

192
0:10:30.804,000 --> 0:10:37,000
(Applause)

193
0:10:40.736,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Facebook, you were on the wrong side of history in that.

194
0:10:44.752,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And you were on the wrong side of history in this --

195
0:10:48.665,000 --> 0:10:51,000
in refusing to give us the answers that we need.

196
0:10:52.696,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And that is why I am here.

197
0:10:55.006,000 --> 0:10:59,000
To address you directly, the gods of Silicon Valley.

198
0:10:59.714,000 --> 0:11:03,000
(Applause)

199
0:11:03.982,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Mark Zuckerberg ...

200
0:11:05.275,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Applause)

201
0:11:06.926,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and Sheryl Sandberg and Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Jack Dorsey,

202
0:11:15.125,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and your employees and your investors, too.

203
0:11:19.43,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Because 100 years ago,

204
0:11:21.422,000 --> 0:11:23,000
the biggest danger in the South Wales coal mines was gas.

205
0:11:24.223,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Silent and deadly and invisible.

206
0:11:26.651,000 --> 0:11:29,000
It's why they sent the canaries down first to check the air.

207
0:11:29.707,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And in this massive, global, online experiment that we are all living through,

208
0:11:33.82,000 --> 0:11:35,000
we in Britain are the canary.

209
0:11:36.668,000 --> 0:11:38,000
We are what happens to a western democracy

210
0:11:39.482,000 --> 0:11:43,000
when a hundred years of electoral laws are disrupted by technology.

211
0:11:45.117,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Our democracy is broken, our laws don't work anymore,

212
0:11:48.966,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and it's not me saying this,

213
0:11:50.688,000 --> 0:11:53,000
it's our parliament published a report saying this.

214
0:11:55.18,000 --> 0:11:59,000
This technology that you have invented has been amazing.

215
0:12:00.696,000 --> 0:12:02,000
But now, it's a crime scene.

216
0:12:03.927,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And you have the evidence.

217
0:12:07.553,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And it is not enough to say that you will do better in the future.

218
0:12:12.973,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Because to have any hope of stopping this from happening again,

219
0:12:17.307,000 --> 0:12:19,000
we have to know the truth.

220
0:12:21.362,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And maybe you think, "Well, it was just a few ads.

221
0:12:24.489,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And people are smarter than that, right?"

222
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
To which I would say, "Good luck with that."

223
0:12:32.314,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Because what the Brexit vote demonstrates

224
0:12:35.641,000 --> 0:12:37,000
is that liberal democracy is broken.

225
0:12:39.45,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And you broke it.

226
0:12:42.282,000 --> 0:12:44,000
This is not democracy --

227
0:12:44.679,000 --> 0:12:49,000
spreading lies in darkness, paid for with illegal cash,

228
0:12:50.671,000 --> 0:12:51,000
from God knows where.

229
0:12:53.527,000 --> 0:12:55,000
It's subversion,

230
0:12:55.678,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and you are accessories to it.

231
0:13:00.201,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Applause)

232
0:13:09.845,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Our parliament has been the first in the world

233
0:13:13.099,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to try to hold you to account,

234
0:13:15.632,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and it's failed.

235
0:13:17.371,000 --> 0:13:21,000
You are literally beyond the reach of British law -- not just British laws,

236
0:13:22.244,000 --> 0:13:25,000
this is nine parliaments, nine countries are represented here,

237
0:13:25.522,000 --> 0:13:28,000
who Mark Zuckerberg refused to come and give evidence to.

238
0:13:30.497,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And what you don't seem to understand is that this is bigger than you.

239
0:13:35.092,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And it's bigger than any of us.

240
0:13:37.163,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And it is not about left or right or "Leave" or "Remain" or Trump or not.

241
0:13:43.101,000 --> 0:13:44,000
It's about whether it's actually possible

242
0:13:45.117,000 --> 0:13:47,000
to have a free and fair election ever again.

243
0:13:48.497,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Because as it stands, I don't think it is.

244
0:13:52.275,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And so my question to you is, is this what you want?

245
0:13:57.172,000 --> 0:14:,000
Is this how you want history to remember you:

246
0:14:01.223,000 --> 0:14:04,000
as the handmaidens to authoritarianism

247
0:14:05.056,000 --> 0:14:08,000
that is on the rise all across the world?

248
0:14:10.387,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Because you set out to connect people.

249
0:14:13.807,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And you are refusing to acknowledge

250
0:14:15.859,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that the same technology is now driving us apart.

251
0:14:21.038,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And my question to everybody else is,

252
0:14:23.332,000 --> 0:14:24,000
is this what we want:

253
0:14:25.903,000 --> 0:14:27,000
to let them get away with it,

254
0:14:28.569,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and to sit back and play with our phones, as this darkness falls?

255
0:14:34.561,000 --> 0:14:39,000
The history of the South Wales Valleys is of a fight for rights.

256
0:14:40.498,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And this is not a drill -- it's a point of inflection.

257
0:14:45.53,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Democracy is not guaranteed, and it is not inevitable,

258
0:14:49.174,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and we have to fight and we have to win

259
0:14:51.753,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and we cannot let these tech companies have this unchecked power.

260
0:14:56.563,000 --> 0:14:58,000
It's up to us -- you, me and all of us.

261
0:14:59.357,000 --> 0:15:02,000
We are the ones who have to take back control.

262
0:15:04.619,000 --> 0:15:07,000
(Applause)

263
0:15:07.695,000 --> 0:15:09,000
(Cheers)

264
0:15:10.199,000 --> 0:15:13,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.897,000 --> 0:00:16,000
To me, social justice is a simple concept.

2
0:00:16.985,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It's the notion that all people in a society

3
0:00:19.446,000 --> 0:00:24,000
deserve fair and equitable rights, opportunities and access to resources.

4
0:00:25.27,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But it's become controversial and nebulous,

5
0:00:28.335,000 --> 0:00:29,000
because we've stopped talking

6
0:00:29.792,000 --> 0:00:32,000
about what working for social justice actually looks like.

7
0:00:34.35,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Working for social justice can look like this ...

8
0:00:37.592,000 --> 0:00:38,000
or this.

9
0:00:39.255,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It can look like this ...

10
0:00:41.452,000 --> 0:00:42,000
or it can look like this ...

11
0:00:43.218,000 --> 0:00:44,000
or my favorite ...

12
0:00:45.141,000 --> 0:00:46,000
it can look like that.

13
0:00:47.543,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Those are my students,

14
0:00:48.806,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and whenever I'm asked to articulate my work or my priorities as a teacher,

15
0:00:53.061,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I explain that I believe education can be a tool for social justice.

16
0:00:59.282,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But a few months ago, I logged onto Twitter -- as I do --

17
0:01:02.949,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and I saw that a fellow teacher had taken issue with that belief.

18
0:01:07.521,000 --> 0:01:11,000
"Teachers," he said, "should not be social justice warriors,

19
0:01:11.963,000 --> 0:01:13,000
because the purpose of education is to educate."

20
0:01:15.63,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And he ended his argument by saying,

21
0:01:17.989,000 --> 0:01:19,000
"I teach my subject."

22
0:01:20.816,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But I reject that simplification,

23
0:01:23.713,000 --> 0:01:26,000
because teachers don't just teach subjects,

24
0:01:26.982,000 --> 0:01:27,000
we teach people.

25
0:01:28.988,000 --> 0:01:31,000
When our students walk into our classrooms,

26
0:01:32.457,000 --> 0:01:34,000
they bring their identities with them.

27
0:01:34.655,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Everything they experience in our rooms is bound up in historical context,

28
0:01:39.084,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and so if we insist that education happens in a vacuum,

29
0:01:42.637,000 --> 0:01:43,000
we do our students a disservice.

30
0:01:45.304,000 --> 0:01:47,000
We teach them that education doesn't really matter,

31
0:01:48.305,000 --> 0:01:51,000
because it's not relevant to what's happening all around them.

32
0:01:52.468,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And what's happening all around them?

33
0:01:55.101,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Well, racism for one.

34
0:01:57.263,000 --> 0:02:,000
According to results of the Implicit Association Test,

35
0:02:00.371,000 --> 0:02:06,000
fully 88 percent of white people harbored subconscious biases against black people,

36
0:02:06.679,000 --> 0:02:11,000
believing them to be less intelligent, lazier and more dangerous than whites.

37
0:02:12.485,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And that's just one concrete example of the insidious effects

38
0:02:16.326,000 --> 0:02:19,000
of historic and systemic racism on our country.

39
0:02:19.959,000 --> 0:02:22,000
For more evidence, we could look at incarceration rates;

40
0:02:23.333,000 --> 0:02:26,000
we could look at statistics on police violence against black people;

41
0:02:26.655,000 --> 0:02:28,000
we could look at the opportunity gap in education --

42
0:02:29.115,000 --> 0:02:33,000
so yeah, social justice belongs in our schools.

43
0:02:34.139,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Social justice should be a part of the mission of every school

44
0:02:37.88,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and every teacher in America,

45
0:02:40.049,000 --> 0:02:43,000
if we want "liberty and justice for all" to be more than a slogan ...

46
0:02:45.176,000 --> 0:02:5,000
because schools are crucial places for children to become active citizens

47
0:02:50.237,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and to learn the skills and the tools that they need to change the world.

48
0:02:54.906,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So what are those skills?

49
0:02:56.442,000 --> 0:02:57,000
OK, here's a secret:

50
0:02:58.127,000 --> 0:02:59,000
many of the skills that people need

51
0:02:59.951,000 --> 0:03:02,000
to orchestrate the kinds of change that will lead to justice

52
0:03:03.053,000 --> 0:03:05,000
are already built into the work of schools.

53
0:03:05.539,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Things like problem-solving,

54
0:03:07.878,000 --> 0:03:09,000
critical thinking, collaboration, perseverance --

55
0:03:10.219,000 --> 0:03:12,000
none of that should be revolutionary on its own.

56
0:03:13.502,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Combine that with the ability to understand history

57
0:03:16.602,000 --> 0:03:2,000
not as one static and objective narrative on which we all agree,

58
0:03:21.572,000 --> 0:03:23,000
but as a series of intertwined events

59
0:03:24.296,000 --> 0:03:26,000
about which there can be countless interpretations.

60
0:03:27.525,000 --> 0:03:3,000
If we deliberately choose to explore history with our students

61
0:03:30.876,000 --> 0:03:31,000
rather than just teach it,

62
0:03:32.69,000 --> 0:03:34,000
we help them understand that history is ongoing

63
0:03:35.48,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and that it's connected to current movements for justice.

64
0:03:38.916,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And we help them see themselves as potential players

65
0:03:41.69,000 --> 0:03:42,000
within a living history.

66
0:03:44.694,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So those are the skills I'm talking about

67
0:03:46.679,000 --> 0:03:48,000
when I say that education can be a place

68
0:03:48.815,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to help kids learn how to work for justice.

69
0:03:52.583,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But maybe the reason

70
0:03:53.886,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that my Twitter critic wasn't happy with that idea

71
0:03:57.057,000 --> 0:03:59,000
is because he doesn't agree with my definition of justice.

72
0:04:00.496,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Fair enough.

73
0:04:01.696,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Maybe he and I don't see eye to eye, politically.

74
0:04:04.724,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But here's the thing:

75
0:04:06.397,000 --> 0:04:1,000
our aim is to encourage students to articulate their own opinions,

76
0:04:11.218,000 --> 0:04:13,000
not to coerce them into agreeing with us,

77
0:04:13.685,000 --> 0:04:16,000
so it actually doesn't matter if he and I agree.

78
0:04:17.208,000 --> 0:04:2,000
What matters is that we're helping students have those conversations

79
0:04:20.488,000 --> 0:04:21,000
with each other.

80
0:04:22.027,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And that means that as adults,

81
0:04:23.48,000 --> 0:04:26,000
we need to learn how to become effective facilitators

82
0:04:26.566,000 --> 0:04:27,000
of our students' activism.

83
0:04:28.576,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We've got to help them learn how to have really tricky conversations,

84
0:04:32.108,000 --> 0:04:35,000
we have to expose them to different opinions,

85
0:04:35.324,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and we have to help them see

86
0:04:37.325,000 --> 0:04:4,000
how what they're learning in school connects to the world outside.

87
0:04:41.23,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So here's an example of that.

88
0:04:42.782,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Every year, my students study the history of apartheid in South Africa

89
0:04:46.299,000 --> 0:04:47,000
as a case study of injustice.

90
0:04:48.75,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Now for those of you who don't know,

91
0:04:50.489,000 --> 0:04:52,000
apartheid was a brutally racist system,

92
0:04:52.61,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and the white-ruled government in South Africa imposed racist laws

93
0:04:56.054,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to oppress people of color,

94
0:04:57.877,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and if you resisted those laws, you risked jail time, violence or death.

95
0:05:02.459,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And around the world, other countries' governments,

96
0:05:06.417,000 --> 0:05:08,000
including ours in the United States,

97
0:05:08.526,000 --> 0:05:11,000
hesitated to sanction South Africa, because ...

98
0:05:11.647,000 --> 0:05:12,000
well ...

99
0:05:12.822,000 --> 0:05:13,000
we benefited from its resources.

100
0:05:15.214,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So in 1976, the South African government passed a new law

101
0:05:19.563,000 --> 0:05:21,000
which required that all students in South Africa

102
0:05:22.056,000 --> 0:05:24,000
learn in the language Afrikaans,

103
0:05:24.228,000 --> 0:05:25,000
which was a white language,

104
0:05:25.63,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and many black South Africans referred to that language

105
0:05:28.226,000 --> 0:05:29,000
as the language of the oppressor.

106
0:05:30.784,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So not surprisingly,

107
0:05:31.959,000 --> 0:05:33,000
students of color were outraged at this law.

108
0:05:34.738,000 --> 0:05:36,000
They already attended segregated schools

109
0:05:37.241,000 --> 0:05:39,000
with overcrowded classrooms,

110
0:05:39.32,000 --> 0:05:4,000
a lack of resources

111
0:05:40.708,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and a frankly racist curriculum,

112
0:05:42.815,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and now they were being told to learn

113
0:05:44.608,000 --> 0:05:47,000
in a language neither they nor their teachers spoke.

114
0:05:48.652,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So on the morning of June 16, 1976,

115
0:05:52.294,000 --> 0:05:54,000
thousands of kids from the township of Soweto

116
0:05:55.305,000 --> 0:05:56,000
walked out of schools.

117
0:05:56.887,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And they marched peacefully through the streets to protest the law.

118
0:06:01.384,000 --> 0:06:03,000
At an intersection, they met up with the police,

119
0:06:04.217,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and when the kids refused to turn back,

120
0:06:06.395,000 --> 0:06:08,000
the police officers set dogs on them ...

121
0:06:09.888,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and then they opened fire ...

122
0:06:12.818,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and the Soweto uprising ended in tragedy.

123
0:06:16.131,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Apartheid itself didn't end until almost 20 years later,

124
0:06:21.039,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but the activism of those kids in Soweto profoundly changed

125
0:06:25.358,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the way the world viewed what was happening in South Africa.

126
0:06:29.922,000 --> 0:06:32,000
News outlets all around the world published this photo

127
0:06:33.119,000 --> 0:06:35,000
of 13-year-old Hector Pieterson,

128
0:06:35.307,000 --> 0:06:38,000
who was one of the first people killed by police in Soweto,

129
0:06:38.996,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and it became nearly impossible to ignore the brutality

130
0:06:42.084,000 --> 0:06:43,000
of the apartheid regime.

131
0:06:43.842,000 --> 0:06:46,000
In the months and the years that followed the Soweto uprising,

132
0:06:47.121,000 --> 0:06:5,000
more and more countries exerted political and economic pressure

133
0:06:50.415,000 --> 0:06:52,000
on the South African government to end apartheid,

134
0:06:53.319,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and it was largely due to the activism of those kids in Soweto.

135
0:06:59.833,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So every year my kids learn about this.

136
0:07:02.587,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And invariably, they start to draw connections

137
0:07:05.609,000 --> 0:07:07,000
between those kids in Soweto and themselves.

138
0:07:08.486,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And they start to ask themselves

139
0:07:10.267,000 --> 0:07:13,000
what kind of political power and agency they have.

140
0:07:14.345,000 --> 0:07:16,000
They ask themselves whether there would ever be a reason

141
0:07:17.145,000 --> 0:07:18,000
they would risk their lives

142
0:07:19.095,000 --> 0:07:22,000
so that a future generation could live in a more just world.

143
0:07:22.813,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And most profoundly for me, every single year,

144
0:07:26.037,000 --> 0:07:31,000
they ask themselves whether adults will ever listen to their voices.

145
0:07:32.788,000 --> 0:07:33,000
A few years ago,

146
0:07:33.963,000 --> 0:07:36,000
my principal got an anonymous email from one of our students.

147
0:07:37.681,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It informed him that the following day,

148
0:07:39.577,000 --> 0:07:41,000
the students planned to walk out of school.

149
0:07:42.263,000 --> 0:07:44,000
This was in the wake of Michael Brown's death

150
0:07:44.483,000 --> 0:07:45,000
in Ferguson, Missouri,

151
0:07:45.657,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and the students were planning to join a walkout and march

152
0:07:48.804,000 --> 0:07:5,000
in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.

153
0:07:51.622,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So at this point,

154
0:07:52.797,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the staff at the school had a decision to make.

155
0:07:55.363,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Would we use our authority and our power to try to control the students

156
0:07:59.488,000 --> 0:08:,000
and prevent them from leaving,

157
0:08:01.179,000 --> 0:08:03,000
or would we support them

158
0:08:03.381,000 --> 0:08:06,000
as they put into practice the principles of social justice

159
0:08:06.521,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that we had taught them about since the ninth-grade year?

160
0:08:10.412,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So the next morning, the kids left school en masse

161
0:08:13.158,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and they gathered on the lawn.

162
0:08:14.737,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And one of the seniors jumped up on a picnic table

163
0:08:17.365,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and went over safety expectations.

164
0:08:19.333,000 --> 0:08:2,000
(Laughter)

165
0:08:20.365,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And the younger kids took it very seriously.

166
0:08:22.636,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And as teachers and as staff we told them,

167
0:08:25.19,000 --> 0:08:26,000
"OK, be safe,"

168
0:08:26.506,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and we watched as they marched off.

169
0:08:28.808,000 --> 0:08:31,000
The kids who chose to stay spent that afternoon in class.

170
0:08:32.412,000 --> 0:08:34,000
They debated the merits of protest,

171
0:08:34.617,000 --> 0:08:37,000
they talked about the history of the Black Lives Matter movement,

172
0:08:37.741,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and they went on with classes as scheduled.

173
0:08:39.774,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And those who chose to leave participated in a citywide student walkout

174
0:08:44.095,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and raised their collective voice for justice.

175
0:08:47.81,000 --> 0:08:5,000
But no matter where they chose to spend the afternoon,

176
0:08:50.836,000 --> 0:08:52,000
our kids learned valuable lessons that day.

177
0:08:54.521,000 --> 0:08:56,000
They learned that the adults in their lives would support them

178
0:08:57.478,000 --> 0:08:59,000
even as we worried for their safety.

179
0:09:00.395,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And they learned that they didn't need us to tell them how or when

180
0:09:03.614,000 --> 0:09:04,000
or even why to protest.

181
0:09:05.911,000 --> 0:09:08,000
They learned that they were members of a community of young people

182
0:09:09.031,000 --> 0:09:12,000
with a shared vision of a more equitable society,

183
0:09:12.103,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and they learned that they had power within that society.

184
0:09:15.893,000 --> 0:09:17,000
They learned that events like the Soweto uprising

185
0:09:18.235,000 --> 0:09:2,000
are not ancient history,

186
0:09:20.478,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and they don't have to end in tragedy.

187
0:09:23.882,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And that's what education as a tool for social justice can look like.

188
0:09:29.349,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And here's the thing:

189
0:09:30.524,000 --> 0:09:32,000
our kids are ready for this kind of work.

190
0:09:32.601,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So in 2015,

191
0:09:33.796,000 --> 0:09:35,000
incoming college freshmen were surveyed,

192
0:09:36.067,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and 8.5 percent of them said

193
0:09:38.442,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that there was a "very good chance" they would participate in a protest

194
0:09:41.8,000 --> 0:09:42,000
sometime during their college career.

195
0:09:43.715,000 --> 0:09:45,000
That might not seem very impressive,

196
0:09:45.891,000 --> 0:09:46,000
but consider the fact

197
0:09:47.116,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that it's the largest number of students to say that since 1967.

198
0:09:52.073,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And 75 percent of those kids

199
0:09:53.836,000 --> 0:09:55,000
said that helping other people who are having difficulty

200
0:09:56.485,000 --> 0:09:58,000
was a "very important" or "essential" goal for them.

201
0:09:58.94,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Again, the highest number of people to say that since the late 1960s.

202
0:10:02.984,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And research shows us that working for justice doesn't just follow

203
0:10:07.971,000 --> 0:10:09,000
from building all those skills I talked about earlier --

204
0:10:10.623,000 --> 0:10:11,000
it actually goes the other way, too.

205
0:10:12.396,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So working for justice, engaging in activism,

206
0:10:15.506,000 --> 0:10:19,000
helps students build skills like leadership and critical thinking,

207
0:10:19.794,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and it correlates positively with their political participation

208
0:10:22.925,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and their civic engagement

209
0:10:24.323,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and their commitment to their communities later in life.

210
0:10:26.967,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So in other words,

211
0:10:28.463,000 --> 0:10:31,000
students are telling us that social justice matters to them

212
0:10:32.356,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and researchers are telling us that it helps students learn.

213
0:10:36.53,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So now it's up to us to listen,

214
0:10:39.197,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and that might not be easy.

215
0:10:41.984,000 --> 0:10:45,000
In 1976, one of those kids who participated in the Soweto uprising,

216
0:10:46.424,000 --> 0:10:48,000
he said that that event represented divorce

217
0:10:49.091,000 --> 0:10:51,000
between black children and their families,

218
0:10:51.141,000 --> 0:10:53,000
because their families had grown up under apartheid,

219
0:10:53.745,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and they knew how dangerous it was to speak out.

220
0:10:56.008,000 --> 0:10:58,000
They wanted their kids to lay low and stay safe.

221
0:10:58.459,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And when our kids threatened to walk out,

222
0:11:00.453,000 --> 0:11:03,000
a lot of the adults in our community were really conflicted, too.

223
0:11:04.515,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Some of us worried that they might encounter violence.

224
0:11:07.457,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Other people worried that they would walk out

225
0:11:09.635,000 --> 0:11:11,000
but they wouldn't really know why they were protesting.

226
0:11:12.231,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And some, including some students' families,

227
0:11:14.335,000 --> 0:11:16,000
were really angry that the school hadn't done more

228
0:11:16.716,000 --> 0:11:17,000
to prevent them from leaving.

229
0:11:18.142,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And all of those fears that adults have about getting this stuff wrong --

230
0:11:22.833,000 --> 0:11:24,000
all of those fears make total sense.

231
0:11:25.68,000 --> 0:11:27,000
But despite those fears,

232
0:11:27.825,000 --> 0:11:31,000
we have got to prove to our students that we will listen to their voices

233
0:11:32.491,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and that they do have the power to effect change.

234
0:11:36.058,000 --> 0:11:39,000
It's our responsibility to equip our students

235
0:11:39.374,000 --> 0:11:41,000
with the tools and the skills that they need

236
0:11:41.916,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to insist on a more equitable world --

237
0:11:44.811,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and then sometimes, to get out of their way,

238
0:11:47.631,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and let them apply those skills to things that they care about.

239
0:11:52.83,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Living up to that vision is going to require

240
0:11:55.974,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that we are flexible,

241
0:11:57.56,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and it's going to require that we're creative.

242
0:11:59.759,000 --> 0:12:01,000
It's going to require that we're brave enough

243
0:12:01.998,000 --> 0:12:04,000
to stand up in the face of people who try to silence

244
0:12:05.546,000 --> 0:12:07,000
or delegitimize dissenting voices.

245
0:12:08.304,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And hardest of all,

246
0:12:09.575,000 --> 0:12:13,000
it's going to require accepting the fact that sometimes we will be the ones

247
0:12:13.964,000 --> 0:12:14,000
our students will rebel against.

248
0:12:15.964,000 --> 0:12:16,000
(Laughter)

249
0:12:17.358,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Sometimes they're going to point out ways in which systems that we have created,

250
0:12:21.422,000 --> 0:12:22,000
or in which we are complicit,

251
0:12:23.134,000 --> 0:12:24,000
contribute to inequity.

252
0:12:25.051,000 --> 0:12:27,000
It's going to be uncomfortable, and it's going to be painful

253
0:12:28.072,000 --> 0:12:31,000
as they push us to question our own assumptions and beliefs.

254
0:12:32.519,000 --> 0:12:36,000
But what if we change the way we think about rebellion in our kids?

255
0:12:37.842,000 --> 0:12:38,000
When our kids rebel --

256
0:12:39.244,000 --> 0:12:41,000
when they thoughtfully push back against our ideas

257
0:12:41.965,000 --> 0:12:42,000
or the way that we do things,

258
0:12:43.772,000 --> 0:12:47,000
what if we chose to see that as a sign that we're doing something right

259
0:12:48.141,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and that they're becoming liberated?

260
0:12:51.474,000 --> 0:12:52,000
I know it would be easier

261
0:12:53.334,000 --> 0:12:57,000
if their critical thinking skills manifested in more convenient ways --

262
0:12:57.48,000 --> 0:12:59,000
on their essays or their standardized tests --

263
0:13:00.457,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I get it --

264
0:13:01.631,000 --> 0:13:04,000
but convenience and justice do not often go hand in hand.

265
0:13:05.671,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And when our kids learn to think critically about the world around them,

266
0:13:09.282,000 --> 0:13:11,000
they become the kinds of engaged citizens

267
0:13:11.956,000 --> 0:13:14,000
who will recognize and question injustice when they see it

268
0:13:15.291,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and work to do something about it.

269
0:13:17.98,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Welcoming rebellion into our schools is going to require some rethinking

270
0:13:22.166,000 --> 0:13:24,000
about what teaching and learning look like,

271
0:13:24.393,000 --> 0:13:26,000
because there's this misconception

272
0:13:26.442,000 --> 0:13:29,000
that if we give students any wiggle room, they're going to walk all over us

273
0:13:30.449,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and classrooms and dinner tables will devolve into total chaos.

274
0:13:35.27,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And if we expect kids to sit silently and passively receive knowledge from us,

275
0:13:41.112,000 --> 0:13:44,000
then their voices will always feel overwhelming.

276
0:13:45.488,000 --> 0:13:49,000
But if we accept instead that learning is sometimes messy,

277
0:13:50.431,000 --> 0:13:53,000
that it requires opportunities to brainstorm and mess up

278
0:13:54.034,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and try again,

279
0:13:55.579,000 --> 0:13:58,000
that our kids dislike chaos and want to learn

280
0:13:58.678,000 --> 0:13:59,000
when they come to school,

281
0:14:00.683,000 --> 0:14:03,000
then we can set up schools to facilitate that kind of learning.

282
0:14:05.015,000 --> 0:14:07,000
So do me a favor and close your eyes for a second

283
0:14:07.85,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and imagine schools where teachers are thought partners,

284
0:14:12.262,000 --> 0:14:15,000
letting students grapple with complex, hard issues

285
0:14:16.273,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and not necessarily giving them the right answers.

286
0:14:20.482,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And imagine schools where we let students make choices --

287
0:14:24.394,000 --> 0:14:26,000
we trust them enough to do that

288
0:14:26.716,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and we let them experience the consequences of those choices.

289
0:14:31.714,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Imagine schools where we let students be humans,

290
0:14:36.502,000 --> 0:14:38,000
with all of the messiness and the uncertainty

291
0:14:39.237,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that is bound to come with that.

292
0:14:42.9,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Whatever you just imagined,

293
0:14:45.509,000 --> 0:14:47,000
it's not mythical,

294
0:14:47.725,000 --> 0:14:5,000
it's not unrealistically idealistic,

295
0:14:51.382,000 --> 0:14:56,000
because teachers all over the country are already pushing the boundaries

296
0:14:56.488,000 --> 0:14:58,000
of what teaching and learning can look like

297
0:14:58.526,000 --> 0:15:,000
with amazing results for kids.

298
0:15:00.764,000 --> 0:15:02,000
They're doing that in all kinds of schools,

299
0:15:03.07,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and there are countless models for teachers who want to get better

300
0:15:06.431,000 --> 0:15:09,000
at helping students learn in a way that's more authentic

301
0:15:09.707,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and engaging and empowering.

302
0:15:13.837,000 --> 0:15:14,000
I was a reading a book recently,

303
0:15:15.433,000 --> 0:15:16,000
it's called "The Students Are Watching,"

304
0:15:17.41,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and it was by Ted and Nancy Sizer,

305
0:15:19.069,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and in that book, they said that the work of education

306
0:15:21.7,000 --> 0:15:23,000
is often described as a series of nouns,

307
0:15:24.093,000 --> 0:15:27,000
like "respect," "honesty," "integrity."

308
0:15:27.164,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And they say those nouns sound really impressive,

309
0:15:30.95,000 --> 0:15:33,000
but often, they fail to actually mean anything in practice.

310
0:15:35.084,000 --> 0:15:37,000
But verbs, they say, are "active,

311
0:15:37.697,000 --> 0:15:38,000
no less demanding

312
0:15:39.243,000 --> 0:15:41,000
but requiring constant engagement.

313
0:15:42.44,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Verbs are not structures but, rather, engines."

314
0:15:46.618,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And so as I read that, I wondered:

315
0:15:48.315,000 --> 0:15:53,000
How do we make justice into an engine driving our work as teachers?

316
0:15:54.478,000 --> 0:15:56,000
What's the verb form of justice?

317
0:15:58.618,000 --> 0:16:01,000
I think there might be an answer to be found in the words of Cornel West,

318
0:16:02.098,000 --> 0:16:06,000
who famously said that "justice is what love looks like in public."

319
0:16:07.544,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And all of my nerdy English teachers in the crowd

320
0:16:10.418,000 --> 0:16:12,000
know that love can be a noun and a verb.

321
0:16:14.653,000 --> 0:16:16,000
School has to be bigger.

322
0:16:17.97,000 --> 0:16:21,000
It has to mean more than "I teach my subject."

323
0:16:23.059,000 --> 0:16:26,000
School has to be about teaching people

324
0:16:26.554,000 --> 0:16:28,000
to change the world for the better.

325
0:16:30.132,000 --> 0:16:31,000
If we believe that,

326
0:16:31.466,000 --> 0:16:34,000
then teaching will always be a political act.

327
0:16:36.296,000 --> 0:16:39,000
We can't be afraid of our students' power.

328
0:16:40.185,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Their power will help them make tomorrow better.

329
0:16:43.678,000 --> 0:16:44,000
But before they can do that,

330
0:16:45.04,000 --> 0:16:47,000
we have to give them chances to practice today.

331
0:16:49.001,000 --> 0:16:52,000
And that practice should start in our schools.

332
0:16:53.578,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Thank you very much.

333
0:16:54.753,000 --> 0:16:57,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:19.608,000 --> 0:00:23,000
So, as researchers, something that we often do is use immense resources

2
0:00:23.853,000 --> 0:00:26,000
to achieve certain capabilities, or achieve certain goals.

3
0:00:27.156,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And this is essential to the progress of science,

4
0:00:29.715,000 --> 0:00:31,000
or exploration of what is possible.

5
0:00:32.064,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But it creates this unfortunate situation

6
0:00:34.096,000 --> 0:00:36,000
where a tiny, tiny fraction of the world

7
0:00:36.136,000 --> 0:00:38,000
can actually participate in this exploration

8
0:00:38.256,000 --> 0:00:39,000
or can benefit from that technology.

9
0:00:40.101,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Something that motivates me,

10
0:00:41.53,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and gets me really excited about my research,

11
0:00:43.767,000 --> 0:00:44,000
is when I see simple opportunities

12
0:00:45.497,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to drastically change that distribution and make the technology accessible

13
0:00:49.321,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to a much wider percentage of the population.

14
0:00:51.454,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I'm going to show you two videos that have gotten a lot of attention

15
0:00:55.01,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that I think embody this philosophy.

16
0:00:56.804,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And they actually use the Nintendo Wii Remote.

17
0:00:59.261,000 --> 0:01:01,000
For those of you who aren't familiar with this device,

18
0:01:01.826,000 --> 0:01:03,000
it's a $40 video game controller.

19
0:01:04.547,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And it's mostly advertised for its motion-sensing capabilities:

20
0:01:07.716,000 --> 0:01:09,000
so you can swing a tennis racket, or hit a baseball bat.

21
0:01:10.382,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But what actually interests me a lot more

22
0:01:12.764,000 --> 0:01:14,000
is the fact that in the tip of each controller

23
0:01:14.946,000 --> 0:01:16,000
is a relatively high-performing infrared camera.

24
0:01:17.76,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And I'm going to show you two demos of why this is useful.

25
0:01:22.243,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So here, I have my computer set up with the projector,

26
0:01:25.171,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and I have a Wii Remote sitting on top of it.

27
0:01:27.552,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And, for example, if you're in a school that doesn't have a lot money,

28
0:01:31.434,000 --> 0:01:32,000
probably a lot of schools,

29
0:01:32.885,000 --> 0:01:35,000
or if you're in an office environment, and you want an interactive whiteboard,

30
0:01:36.591,000 --> 0:01:38,000
normally these cost about two to three thousand dollars.

31
0:01:39.265,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So I'm going to show you how to create one with a Wii Remote.

32
0:01:43.397,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Now, this requires another piece of hardware,

33
0:01:47.005,000 --> 0:01:48,000
which is this infrared pen.

34
0:01:48.597,000 --> 0:01:5,000
You can probably make this yourself for about five dollars

35
0:01:51.431,000 --> 0:01:52,000
with a quick trip to the Radio Shack.

36
0:01:53.287,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It's got a battery, a button and an infrared LED --

37
0:01:55.869,000 --> 0:01:56,000
you guys can't see it --

38
0:01:57.051,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but it turns on whenever I push the button.

39
0:01:59.306,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Now, what this means is that if I run this piece of software,

40
0:02:03.868,000 --> 0:02:07,000
the camera sees the infrared dot,

41
0:02:08.305,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and I can register the location of the camera pixels

42
0:02:12.514,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to the projector pixels.

43
0:02:13.681,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And now this is like an interactive whiteboard surface.

44
0:02:16.387,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Applause)

45
0:02:18.133,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So for about $50 of hardware, you can have your own whiteboard.

46
0:02:22.046,000 --> 0:02:24,000
This is Adobe Photoshop.

47
0:02:24.253,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Applause)

48
0:02:29.942,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Thank you.

49
0:02:31.022,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:32.679,000 --> 0:02:34,000
The software for this I've actually put on my website

51
0:02:35.314,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and have let people download it for free.

52
0:02:37.345,000 --> 0:02:39,000
In the three months this project has been public,

53
0:02:39.74,000 --> 0:02:41,000
it's been downloaded over half a million times.

54
0:02:42.032,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So teachers and students all around the world

55
0:02:44.297,000 --> 0:02:45,000
are already using this.

56
0:02:45.667,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Applause)

57
0:02:51.09,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Although it does do it for 50 dollars,

58
0:02:53.407,000 --> 0:02:55,000
there are some limitations of this approach.

59
0:02:55.488,000 --> 0:02:58,000
You get about 80 percent of the way there, for one percent of the cost.

60
0:02:58.914,000 --> 0:03:,000
Another nice thing is that a camera can see multiple dots,

61
0:03:01.716,000 --> 0:03:04,000
so this is actually a multi-touch, interactive whiteboard system as well.

62
0:03:05.203,000 --> 0:03:07,000
(Applause)

63
0:03:07.425,000 --> 0:03:08,000
For the second demo,

64
0:03:08.577,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I have this Wii Remote that's actually next to the TV.

65
0:03:11.225,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So it's pointing away from the display, rather than pointing at the display.

66
0:03:15.449,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And why this is interesting

67
0:03:17.736,000 --> 0:03:2,000
is that if you put on, say, a pair of safety glasses,

68
0:03:21.474,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that have two infrared dots in them,

69
0:03:23.312,000 --> 0:03:28,000
they are going to give the computer an approximation of your head location.

70
0:03:28.589,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And why this is interesting

71
0:03:29.915,000 --> 0:03:32,000
is I have this sort of application running on the computer monitor,

72
0:03:33.082,000 --> 0:03:35,000
which has a 3D room, with some targets floating in it.

73
0:03:35.638,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And you can see that it looks like a 3D room.

74
0:03:37.901,000 --> 0:03:4,000
kind of like a video game, it sort of looks 3D,

75
0:03:41.272,000 --> 0:03:43,000
but for the most part, the image looks pretty flat,

76
0:03:43.763,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and bound to the surface of the screen.

77
0:03:45.645,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But if we turn on head tracking --

78
0:03:51.05,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the computer can change the image that's on the screen

79
0:03:53.859,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and make it respond to the head movements.

80
0:03:55.899,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So let's switch back to that.

81
0:03:57.304,000 --> 0:04:,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
(Applause)

83
0:04:10.975,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So this has actually been a little bit startling

84
0:04:14.218,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to the game-development community.

85
0:04:15.876,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:17.722,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Because this is about 10 dollars of additional hardware

87
0:04:20.602,000 --> 0:04:21,000
if you already have a Nintendo Wii.

88
0:04:22.485,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So I'm looking forward to seeing some games,

89
0:04:24.794,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and actually Louis Castle, that's him down there,

90
0:04:27.313,000 --> 0:04:3,000
last week announced that Electronic Arts, one of the largest game publishers,

91
0:04:30.976,000 --> 0:04:33,000
is releasing a game in May that has a little Easter egg feature

92
0:04:34.001,000 --> 0:04:36,000
for supporting this type of head tracking.

93
0:04:36.318,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And that's from less than five months

94
0:04:38.268,000 --> 0:04:41,000
from a prototype in my lab to a major commercial product.

95
0:04:41.418,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Applause)

96
0:04:46.935,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Thank you.

97
0:04:48.188,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Applause)

98
0:04:50.451,000 --> 0:04:52,000
But actually, to me, what's almost more interesting

99
0:04:52.874,000 --> 0:04:53,000
than either of these two projects

100
0:04:54.47,000 --> 0:04:56,000
is how people actually found out about them.

101
0:04:56.789,000 --> 0:04:59,000
YouTube has really changed the way, or changed the speed,

102
0:05:00.353,000 --> 0:05:01,000
in which a single individual

103
0:05:01.711,000 --> 0:05:03,000
can actually spread an idea around the world.

104
0:05:03.962,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I'm doing some research in my lab with a video camera,

105
0:05:06.986,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and within the first week, a million people had seen this work,

106
0:05:09.963,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and literally within days, engineers, teachers and students

107
0:05:13.578,000 --> 0:05:16,000
from around the world were already posting their own YouTube videos

108
0:05:16.793,000 --> 0:05:19,000
of them using my system or derivatives of this work.

109
0:05:20.177,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So I hope to see more of that in the future,

110
0:05:22.741,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and hope online video distribution to be embraced by the research community.

111
0:05:26.337,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So thank you very much.

112
0:05:27.614,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Applause)

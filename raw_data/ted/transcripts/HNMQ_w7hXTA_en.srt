1
0:00:13.23,000 --> 0:00:14,000
A few years ago,

2
0:00:14.598,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I always had this thing happening to me,

3
0:00:17.381,000 --> 0:00:18,000
especially at family gatherings

4
0:00:19.165,000 --> 0:00:22,000
like teas with aunts and uncles or something like this.

5
0:00:22.319,000 --> 0:00:23,000
When people come up to you,

6
0:00:23.718,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and they ask you, "So, what are you doing?"

7
0:00:27.068,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And I would have this magical one-word reply,

8
0:00:30.983,000 --> 0:00:32,000
which would make everybody happy:

9
0:00:33.199,000 --> 0:00:34,000
"Medicine.

10
0:00:34.549,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I'm going to be a doctor."

11
0:00:35.999,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Very easy, that's it, everybody's happy and pleased.

12
0:00:39.493,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And it could be so easy,

13
0:00:41.111,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but this effect really only lasts for 30 seconds with me,

14
0:00:45.702,000 --> 0:00:48,000
because that's then the time when one of them would ask,

15
0:00:49.005,000 --> 0:00:51,000
"So, in what area of medicine?

16
0:00:51.424,000 --> 0:00:53,000
What specialty do you want to go into?"

17
0:00:54.326,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And then I would have to strip down in all honesty and just say,

18
0:00:58.696,000 --> 0:01:01,000
"OK, so I'm fascinated with the colon.

19
0:01:02.19,000 --> 0:01:03,000
It all started with the anus,

20
0:01:03.691,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and now it's basically the whole intestinal tract."

21
0:01:06.638,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:08.845,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And this would be the moment when the enthusiasm trickled,

23
0:01:12.167,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and it would maybe also get, like, awkwardly silent in the room,

24
0:01:16.686,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and I would think this was terribly sad,

25
0:01:18.935,000 --> 0:01:21,000
because I do believe our bowels are quite charming.

26
0:01:22.356,000 --> 0:01:23,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:23.98,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And while we're in a time where many people are thinking about

28
0:01:27.073,000 --> 0:01:29,000
what new superfood smoothie to make

29
0:01:29.372,000 --> 0:01:31,000
or if gluten is maybe bad for them,

30
0:01:32.141,000 --> 0:01:37,000
actually, hardly anyone seems to care about the organ where this happens,

31
0:01:37.238,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the concrete anatomy and the mechanisms behind it.

32
0:01:40.284,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And sometimes it seems to me

33
0:01:41.775,000 --> 0:01:44,000
like we're all trying to figure out this magic trick,

34
0:01:45.036,000 --> 0:01:47,000
but nobody's checking out the magician,

35
0:01:47.426,000 --> 0:01:48,000
just because he has, like,

36
0:01:48.735,000 --> 0:01:5,000
an embarrassing hairstyle or something.

37
0:01:52.39,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And actually,

38
0:01:54.841,000 --> 0:01:57,000
there are reasons science disliked the gut for a long time;

39
0:01:58.35,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I have to say this.

40
0:01:59.525,000 --> 0:02:,000
So, it's complex.

41
0:02:00.76,000 --> 0:02:01,000
There's a lot of surface area --

42
0:02:02.318,000 --> 0:02:04,000
about 40 times the area of our skin.

43
0:02:04.546,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Then, in such a tight pipe,

44
0:02:06.149,000 --> 0:02:08,000
there are so many immune cells that are being trained there.

45
0:02:09.096,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We have 100 trillion bacteria doing all sorts of things --

46
0:02:12.307,000 --> 0:02:13,000
producing little molecules.

47
0:02:13.832,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Then there's about 20 different hormones,

48
0:02:16.155,000 --> 0:02:19,000
so we are on a very different level than our genitals, for example.

49
0:02:19.937,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And the nervous system of our gut is so complex

50
0:02:23.082,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that when we cut out a piece,

51
0:02:24.834,000 --> 0:02:26,000
it's independent enough that when we poke it,

52
0:02:27.185,000 --> 0:02:29,000
it mumbles back at us, friendly.

53
0:02:29.557,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:32.078,000 --> 0:02:36,000
But at least those reasons are also the reasons why it's so fascinating

55
0:02:37.092,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and important.

56
0:02:39.295,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It took me three steps to love the gut.

57
0:02:42.571,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So today, I invite you to follow me on those three steps.

58
0:02:47.096,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The very first was just looking at it

59
0:02:49.97,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and asking questions like, "How does it work?"

60
0:02:53.034,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and "Why does it have to look so weird for that sometimes?"

61
0:02:57.629,000 --> 0:03:,000
And it actually wasn't me asking the first kind of these questions,

62
0:03:01.491,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but my roommate.

63
0:03:02.796,000 --> 0:03:04,000
After one heavy night of partying,

64
0:03:05.578,000 --> 0:03:08,000
he came into our shared-room kitchen,

65
0:03:08.747,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and he said, "Giulia, you study medicine. How does pooping work?"

66
0:03:13.846,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:15.911,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And I did study medicine but I had no idea,

68
0:03:18.316,000 --> 0:03:21,000
so I had to go up to my room and look it up in different books.

69
0:03:21.54,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And I found something interesting, I thought, at that time.

70
0:03:24.552,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So it turns out, we don't only have this outer sphincter,

71
0:03:28.433,000 --> 0:03:29,000
we also have an inner sphincter muscle.

72
0:03:30.365,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The outer sphincter we all know, we can control it,

73
0:03:32.782,000 --> 0:03:33,000
we know what's going on there;

74
0:03:34.333,000 --> 0:03:35,000
the inner one, we really don't.

75
0:03:35.949,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So what happens is,

76
0:03:37.169,000 --> 0:03:39,000
when there are leftovers from digestion,

77
0:03:39.658,000 --> 0:03:41,000
they're being delivered to the inner one first.

78
0:03:42.176,000 --> 0:03:44,000
This inner one will open in a reflex

79
0:03:44.646,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and let through a little bit for testing.

80
0:03:46.8,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Laughter)

81
0:03:48.477,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So, there are sensory cells

82
0:03:50.706,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that will analyze what has been delivered: Is it gaseous or is it solid?

83
0:03:56.039,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And they will then send this information up to our brain,

84
0:03:59.158,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and this is the moment when our brain knows,

85
0:04:01.342,000 --> 0:04:02,000
"Oh, I have to go to the toilet."

86
0:04:03.363,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:06.452,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The brain will then do what it's designed to do

88
0:04:08.805,000 --> 0:04:09,000
with its amazing consciousness.

89
0:04:10.593,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It will mediate with our surroundings,

90
0:04:13.386,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and it will say something like,

91
0:04:14.887,000 --> 0:04:15,000
"So, I checked.

92
0:04:16.295,000 --> 0:04:18,000
We are at this TEDx conference -- "

93
0:04:18.979,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:23.083,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Applause)

95
0:04:25.378,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Gaseous?

96
0:04:26.552,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Maybe, if you're sitting on the sides,

97
0:04:28.812,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and you know you can pull it off silently.

98
0:04:32.225,000 --> 0:04:33,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:34.089,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But solid --

100
0:04:35.272,000 --> 0:04:36,000
maybe later.

101
0:04:36.497,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:37.964,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Since our outer sphincter and the brain is connected with nervous cells,

103
0:04:43.418,000 --> 0:04:45,000
they coordinate, cooperate,

104
0:04:45.46,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and they put it back in a waiting line --

105
0:04:47.805,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Laughter)

106
0:04:50.054,000 --> 0:04:51,000
for other times,

107
0:04:51.256,000 --> 0:04:53,000
like, for example, when we're at home sitting on the couch,

108
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
we have nothing better to do,

109
0:04:55.743,000 --> 0:04:56,000
we are free to go.

110
0:04:57.044,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Laughter)

111
0:05:01.954,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Us humans are actually one of the very few animals that do this

112
0:05:06.069,000 --> 0:05:08,000
in such an advanced and clean way.

113
0:05:08.84,000 --> 0:05:1,000
To be honest, I had some newfound respect

114
0:05:11.449,000 --> 0:05:13,000
for that nice, inner sphincter dude --

115
0:05:14.004,000 --> 0:05:15,000
not connected to nerves

116
0:05:15.902,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that care too much about the outer world or the time --

117
0:05:19.143,000 --> 0:05:21,000
just caring about me for once.

118
0:05:21.776,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I thought that was nice.

119
0:05:23.798,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And I used to not be a great fan of public restrooms,

120
0:05:27.406,000 --> 0:05:28,000
but now I can go anywhere,

121
0:05:29.238,000 --> 0:05:3,000
because I consider it more

122
0:05:30.542,000 --> 0:05:33,000
when that inner muscle puts a suggestion on my daily agenda.

123
0:05:34.378,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Laughter)

124
0:05:36.121,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And also I learned something else, which was:

125
0:05:38.872,000 --> 0:05:42,000
looking closely at something I might have shied away from --

126
0:05:43.131,000 --> 0:05:46,000
maybe the weirdest part of myself --

127
0:05:46.172,000 --> 0:05:48,000
left me feeling more fearless,

128
0:05:48.42,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and also appreciating myself more.

129
0:05:51.166,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And I think this happens a lot of times

130
0:05:53.207,000 --> 0:05:55,000
when you look at the gut, actually.

131
0:05:55.245,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Like those funny rumbling noises that happen

132
0:05:58.016,000 --> 0:05:59,000
when you're in a group of friends

133
0:05:59.673,000 --> 0:06:,000
or at the office conference table,

134
0:06:01.423,000 --> 0:06:03,000
going, like, "Merrr, merrr..."

135
0:06:04.815,000 --> 0:06:06,000
This is not because we're hungry.

136
0:06:06.845,000 --> 0:06:09,000
This is because our small intestine is actually a huge neat freak,

137
0:06:10.796,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and it takes the time in between digestion to clean everything up,

138
0:06:15.065,000 --> 0:06:18,000
resulting in those eight meters of gut -- really, seven of them --

139
0:06:18.83,000 --> 0:06:21,000
being very clean and hardly smelling like anything.

140
0:06:22.494,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It will, to achieve this, create a strong muscular wave

141
0:06:26.345,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that moves everything forward that's been leftover after digestion.

142
0:06:30.457,000 --> 0:06:31,000
This can sometimes create a sound,

143
0:06:32.281,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but doesn't necessarily have to always.

144
0:06:35.372,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So what we're embarrassed of is really a sign

145
0:06:38.038,000 --> 0:06:41,000
of something keeping our insides fine and tidy.

146
0:06:41.877,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Or this weird, crooked shape of our stomach --

147
0:06:44.827,000 --> 0:06:45,000
a bit Quasimodo-ish.

148
0:06:46.865,000 --> 0:06:49,000
This actually makes us be able to put pressure on our belly

149
0:06:50.197,000 --> 0:06:51,000
without vomiting,

150
0:06:51.392,000 --> 0:06:52,000
like when we're laughing

151
0:06:52.694,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and when we're doing sports,

152
0:06:54.067,000 --> 0:06:57,000
because the pressure will go up and not so much sideways.

153
0:06:57.407,000 --> 0:06:58,000
This also creates this air bubble

154
0:06:59.316,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that's usually always very visible in X-rays, for example,

155
0:07:03.535,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and can sometimes, with some people,

156
0:07:05.352,000 --> 0:07:06,000
when it gets too big,

157
0:07:07.217,000 --> 0:07:1,000
create discomfort or even some sensations of pain.

158
0:07:10.469,000 --> 0:07:12,000
But for most of the people, is just results

159
0:07:12.643,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that it's far easier to burp when you're laying on your left side

160
0:07:15.93,000 --> 0:07:16,000
instead of your right.

161
0:07:18.312,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And soon I moved a bit further

162
0:07:20.258,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and started to look at the whole picture of our body and health.

163
0:07:23.616,000 --> 0:07:25,000
This was actually after I had heard

164
0:07:26.03,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that someone I knew a little bit had killed himself.

165
0:07:29.489,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It happened that I had been sitting next to that person the day before,

166
0:07:34.222,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and I smelled that he had very bad breath.

167
0:07:37.869,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And when I learned of the suicide the next day,

168
0:07:40.138,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I thought: Could the gut have something to do with it?

169
0:07:43.077,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And I frantically started searching if there were scientific papers

170
0:07:46.317,000 --> 0:07:48,000
on the connection of gut and brain.

171
0:07:48.904,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And to my surprise, I found many.

172
0:07:51.809,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It turns out it's maybe not as simple as we sometimes think.

173
0:07:55.147,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We tend to think our brain makes these commands

174
0:07:57.518,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and then sends them down to the other organs,

175
0:07:59.701,000 --> 0:08:,000
and they all have to listen.

176
0:08:01.417,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But really, it's more that 10 percent of the nerves that connect brain and gut

177
0:08:06.635,000 --> 0:08:09,000
deliver information from the brain to the gut.

178
0:08:09.874,000 --> 0:08:12,000
We know this, for example, in stressful situations,

179
0:08:13.029,000 --> 0:08:17,000
when there are transmitters from the brain that are being sensed by our gut,

180
0:08:17.072,000 --> 0:08:2,000
so the gut will try to lower all the work,

181
0:08:20.666,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and not be working and taking away blood and energy

182
0:08:25.208,000 --> 0:08:27,000
to save energy for problem-solving.

183
0:08:27.519,000 --> 0:08:3,000
This can go as far as nervous vomiting or nervous diarrhea

184
0:08:31.04,000 --> 0:08:34,000
to get rid of food that it then doesn't want to digest.

185
0:08:34.869,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Maybe more interestingly,

186
0:08:36.153,000 --> 0:08:39,000
90 percent of the nervous fibers that connect gut and brain

187
0:08:39.435,000 --> 0:08:42,000
deliver information from our gut to our brain.

188
0:08:43.296,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And when you think about it a little bit,

189
0:08:45.274,000 --> 0:08:48,000
it does make sense, because our brain is very isolated.

190
0:08:48.902,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It's in this bony skull surrounded by a thick skin,

191
0:08:53.271,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and it needs information to put together a feeling

192
0:08:56.282,000 --> 0:08:59,000
of "How am I, as a whole body, doing?"

193
0:08:59.893,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And the gut, actually, is possibly the most important advisor for the brain

194
0:09:04.343,000 --> 0:09:06,000
because it's our largest sensory organ,

195
0:09:07.074,000 --> 0:09:1,000
collecting information not only on the quality of our nutrients,

196
0:09:10.87,000 --> 0:09:14,000
but really also on how are so many of our immune cells doing,

197
0:09:14.986,000 --> 0:09:16,000
or things like the hormones in our blood that it can sense.

198
0:09:17.908,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And it can package this information, and send it up to the brain.

199
0:09:21.014,000 --> 0:09:25,000
It can, there, not reach areas like visual cortex or word formations --

200
0:09:25.783,000 --> 0:09:26,000
otherwise, when we digest,

201
0:09:27.602,000 --> 0:09:31,000
we would see funny colors or we would make funny noises -- no.

202
0:09:32.123,000 --> 0:09:34,000
But it can reach areas for things like morality,

203
0:09:35.014,000 --> 0:09:36,000
fear or emotional processing

204
0:09:36.897,000 --> 0:09:37,000
or areas for self-awareness.

205
0:09:39.377,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So it does make sense

206
0:09:40.848,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that when our body and our brain are putting together this feeling

207
0:09:44.52,000 --> 0:09:46,000
of, "How am I, as a whole body, doing?"

208
0:09:46.973,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that the gut has something to contribute to this process.

209
0:09:52.103,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And it also makes sense

210
0:09:53.346,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that people who have conditions like irritable bowel syndrome

211
0:09:56.636,000 --> 0:09:57,000
or inflammatory bowel disease

212
0:09:58.496,000 --> 0:10:01,000
have a higher risk of having anxiety or depression.

213
0:10:01.872,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I think this is good information to share,

214
0:10:04.402,000 --> 0:10:05,000
because many people will think,

215
0:10:05.94,000 --> 0:10:08,000
"I have this gut thing, and maybe I also have this mental health thing."

216
0:10:09.349,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And maybe -- because science is not clear on that right now --

217
0:10:12.666,000 --> 0:10:15,000
it's really just that the brain is feeling sympathy with their gut.

218
0:10:17.117,000 --> 0:10:21,000
This has yet to grow in evidence until it can come to practice.

219
0:10:21.599,000 --> 0:10:23,000
But just knowing about these kinds of research

220
0:10:24.214,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that's out there at the moment

221
0:10:26.284,000 --> 0:10:28,000
helps me in my daily life.

222
0:10:28.523,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And it makes me think differently of my moods

223
0:10:30.867,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and not externalize so much all the time.

224
0:10:33.703,000 --> 0:10:37,000
I feel oftentimes during the day we are a brain and a screen,

225
0:10:37.996,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and we will tend to look for answers right there

226
0:10:40.847,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and maybe the work is stupid or our neighbor --

227
0:10:43.146,000 --> 0:10:45,000
but really, moods can also come from within.

228
0:10:45.508,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And just knowing this helped me,

229
0:10:47.369,000 --> 0:10:5,000
for example, when I sometimes wake up too early,

230
0:10:50.623,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and I start to worry and wander around with my thoughts.

231
0:10:53.358,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Then I think, "Stop. What did I eat yesterday?

232
0:10:56.413,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Did I stress myself out too much?

233
0:10:58.138,000 --> 0:11:,000
Did I eat too late or something?"

234
0:11:00.198,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And then maybe get up and make myself a tea,

235
0:11:02.461,000 --> 0:11:03,000
something light to digest.

236
0:11:04.011,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And as simple as that sounds,

237
0:11:06.11,000 --> 0:11:09,000
I think it's been surprisingly good for me.

238
0:11:10.469,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Step three took me further away from our body,

239
0:11:15.367,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and to really understanding bacteria differently.

240
0:11:18.985,000 --> 0:11:21,000
The research we have today is creating a new definition

241
0:11:22.257,000 --> 0:11:24,000
of what real cleanliness is.

242
0:11:25.366,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And it's not the hygiene hypothesis --

243
0:11:28.923,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I think many maybe know this.

244
0:11:30.328,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So it states that when you have too little microbes in your environment

245
0:11:33.894,000 --> 0:11:34,000
because you clean all the time,

246
0:11:35.519,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that's not really a good thing,

247
0:11:37.145,000 --> 0:11:4,000
because people get more allergies or autoimmune diseases then.

248
0:11:40.843,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So I knew this hypothesis,

249
0:11:43.085,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and I thought I wouldn't learn so much

250
0:11:44.962,000 --> 0:11:46,000
from looking at cleanliness in the gut.

251
0:11:47.45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
But I was wrong.

252
0:11:49.385,000 --> 0:11:5,000
It turns out,

253
0:11:51.358,000 --> 0:11:54,000
real cleanliness is not about killing off bacteria right away.

254
0:11:55.347,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Real cleanliness is a bit different.

255
0:11:57.98,000 --> 0:11:58,000
When we look at the facts,

256
0:11:59.532,000 --> 0:12:03,000
95 percent of all bacteria on this planet don't harm us -- they can't,

257
0:12:04.396,000 --> 0:12:05,000
they don't have the genes to do so.

258
0:12:06.896,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Many, actually, help us a lot,

259
0:12:08.961,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and scientists at the moment are looking into things like:

260
0:12:12.222,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Do some bacteria help us clean the gut?

261
0:12:14.867,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Do they help us digest?

262
0:12:16.265,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Do they make us put on weight or have a lean figure

263
0:12:18.758,000 --> 0:12:19,000
although we're eating lots?

264
0:12:20.697,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Are others making us feel more courageous or even more resilient to stress?

265
0:12:25.398,000 --> 0:12:28,000
So you see, there are more questions when it comes to cleanliness.

266
0:12:30.171,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And, actually, the thing is, it's about a healthy balance, I think.

267
0:12:33.469,000 --> 0:12:35,000
You can't avoid the bad all the time.

268
0:12:35.906,000 --> 0:12:36,000
This is simply not possible;

269
0:12:37.663,000 --> 0:12:38,000
there's always something bad around.

270
0:12:40.094,000 --> 0:12:44,000
So what really the whole deal is when you look at a clean gut,

271
0:12:44.793,000 --> 0:12:47,000
it's about having good bacteria, enough of them,

272
0:12:48.639,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and then some bad.

273
0:12:50.444,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Our immune system needs the bad, too,

274
0:12:52.356,000 --> 0:12:54,000
so it knows what it's looking out for.

275
0:12:54.918,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So I started having this different perspective on cleanliness

276
0:12:58.377,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and a few weeks later,

277
0:12:59.787,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I held a talk at my university,

278
0:13:01.943,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and I made a mistake by 1,000.

279
0:13:04.063,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And I went home and I realized in that moment,

280
0:13:06.521,000 --> 0:13:09,000
I was like, "Ah! I made a mistake by 1,000.

281
0:13:09.56,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Oh God, that's so much, and that's so embarrassing."

282
0:13:12.667,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And I started to think about this, I was like, "Ugh!"

283
0:13:15.458,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And after a while I said,

284
0:13:16.673,000 --> 0:13:17,000
"OK, I made this one mistake,

285
0:13:18.527,000 --> 0:13:22,000
but then I also told so many good and right and helpful things,

286
0:13:22.635,000 --> 0:13:23,000
so I think it's OK, you know?

287
0:13:24.13,000 --> 0:13:25,000
It's a clean thing."

288
0:13:25.524,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And then I was like, "Oh, wait.

289
0:13:27.976,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Maybe I took my perspective on cleanliness further."

290
0:13:31.166,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And it's my theory at the moment that maybe we all do.

291
0:13:33.872,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Take it a bit further than just cleaning our living room,

292
0:13:36.666,000 --> 0:13:39,000
where maybe we make it to sort like a life hygiene.

293
0:13:39.796,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Knowing that this is about fostering the good

294
0:13:43.453,000 --> 0:13:46,000
just as much as trying to shelter yourself from the bad

295
0:13:47.116,000 --> 0:13:49,000
had a very calming effect on me.

296
0:13:49.753,000 --> 0:13:5,000
So in that sense,

297
0:13:51.233,000 --> 0:13:54,000
I hope today I told you mostly good and helpful things,

298
0:13:54.947,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and thank you for your time,

299
0:13:56.517,000 --> 0:13:57,000
for listening to me.

300
0:13:57.952,000 --> 0:13:59,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.072,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Today's computers are so amazing

2
0:00:16.81,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that we fail to notice how terrible they really are.

3
0:00:22.172,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I'd like to talk to you today about this problem,

4
0:00:24.594,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and how we can fix it with neuroscience.

5
0:00:28.056,000 --> 0:00:32,000
First, I'd like to take you back to a frosty night in Harlem in 2011

6
0:00:32.097,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that had a profound impact on me.

7
0:00:34.437,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I was sitting in a dive bar outside of Columbia University,

8
0:00:37.635,000 --> 0:00:39,000
where I studied computer science and neuroscience,

9
0:00:40.567,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and I was having this great conversation with a fellow student

10
0:00:43.659,000 --> 0:00:46,000
about the power of holograms to one day replace computers.

11
0:00:47.39,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And just as we were getting to the best part of the conversation,

12
0:00:50.503,000 --> 0:00:51,000
of course, his phone lights up.

13
0:00:52.621,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And he pulls it towards himself, and he looks down and he starts typing.

14
0:00:57.07,000 --> 0:01:,000
And then he forces his eyeballs back up to mine and he goes,

15
0:01:00.277,000 --> 0:01:02,000
"Keep going. I'm with you."

16
0:01:02.404,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But of course his eyes were glazed over,

17
0:01:04.785,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and the moment was dead.

18
0:01:06.964,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Meanwhile across the bar,

19
0:01:08.208,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I noticed another student holding his phone,

20
0:01:10.516,000 --> 0:01:11,000
this time towards a group.

21
0:01:11.985,000 --> 0:01:13,000
He was swiping through pictures on Instagram,

22
0:01:14.769,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and these kids were laughing hysterically.

23
0:01:17.327,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And that dichotomy between how crappy I was feeling

24
0:01:20.87,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and how happy they were feeling about the same technology,

25
0:01:23.672,000 --> 0:01:24,000
really got me thinking.

26
0:01:25.074,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And the more I thought of it, the more I realized

27
0:01:27.431,000 --> 0:01:3,000
it was clearly not the digital information that was the bad guy here,

28
0:01:31.227,000 --> 0:01:34,000
it was simply the display position that was separating me from my friend

29
0:01:34.958,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and that was binding those kids together.

30
0:01:37.608,000 --> 0:01:39,000
See, they were connected around something,

31
0:01:39.831,000 --> 0:01:42,000
just like our ancestors who evolved their social cognitions

32
0:01:43.253,000 --> 0:01:45,000
telling stories around the campfire.

33
0:01:45.857,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And that's exactly what tools should do, I think.

34
0:01:48.225,000 --> 0:01:49,000
They should extend our bodies.

35
0:01:49.728,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And I think computers today are doing quite the opposite.

36
0:01:52.939,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Whether you're sending an email to your wife

37
0:01:55.191,000 --> 0:01:57,000
or you're composing a symphony

38
0:01:57.237,000 --> 0:01:58,000
or just consoling a friend,

39
0:01:58.865,000 --> 0:02:,000
you're doing it in pretty much the same way.

40
0:02:01.235,000 --> 0:02:03,000
You're hunched over these rectangles,

41
0:02:03.492,000 --> 0:02:05,000
fumbling with buttons and menus and more rectangles.

42
0:02:06.759,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And I think this is the wrong way,

43
0:02:08.78,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I think we can start using a much more natural machine.

44
0:02:12.232,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We should use machines that bring our work back into the world.

45
0:02:15.774,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We should use machines that use the principles of neuroscience

46
0:02:18.817,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to extend our senses versus going against them.

47
0:02:23.305,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Now it just so happens that I have such a machine here.

48
0:02:26.116,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It's called the Meta 2.

49
0:02:27.297,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Let's try it out.

50
0:02:37.617,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Now in front of me right now, I can see the audience,

51
0:02:40.454,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and I can see my very hands.

52
0:02:43.026,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And in three, two, one,

53
0:02:45.227,000 --> 0:02:47,000
we're going to see an immersive hologram appear,

54
0:02:48.003,000 --> 0:02:5,000
a very realistic hologram appear in front of me,

55
0:02:50.307,000 --> 0:02:52,000
of our very glasses I'm wearing on my head right now.

56
0:02:52.895,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And of course this could be anything that we're shopping for

57
0:02:55.76,000 --> 0:02:56,000
or learning from,

58
0:02:56.935,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and I can use my hands

59
0:02:58.302,000 --> 0:03:02,000
to very nicely kind of move it around with fine control.

60
0:03:02.434,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And I think Iron Man would be proud.

61
0:03:06.643,000 --> 0:03:08,000
We're going to come back to this in just a bit.

62
0:03:09.783,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Applause)

63
0:03:11.971,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Now if you're anything like me, your mind is already reeling

64
0:03:14.906,000 --> 0:03:17,000
with the possibilities of what we can do with this kind of technology,

65
0:03:18.231,000 --> 0:03:19,000
so let's look at a few.

66
0:03:19.413,000 --> 0:03:2,000
My mom is an architect,

67
0:03:20.587,000 --> 0:03:21,000
so naturally the first thing I imagined

68
0:03:22.516,000 --> 0:03:24,000
was laying out a building in 3D space

69
0:03:25.021,000 --> 0:03:27,000
instead of having to use these 2D floor plans.

70
0:03:27.437,000 --> 0:03:29,000
She's actually touching graphics right now

71
0:03:29.926,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and selecting an interior decor.

72
0:03:31.727,000 --> 0:03:34,000
This was all shot through a GoPro through our very glasses.

73
0:03:35.115,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And this next use case is very personal to me,

74
0:03:37.754,000 --> 0:03:4,000
it's Professor Adam Gazzaley's glass brain project,

75
0:03:41.192,000 --> 0:03:42,000
courtesy of UCSF.

76
0:03:43.107,000 --> 0:03:44,000
As a neuroscience student,

77
0:03:44.826,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I would always fantasize

78
0:03:46.247,000 --> 0:03:51,000
about the ability to learn and memorize these complex brain structures

79
0:03:51.71,000 --> 0:03:52,000
with an actual machine,

80
0:03:52.901,000 --> 0:03:55,000
where I could touch and play with the various brain structures.

81
0:03:56.535,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Now what you're seeing is called augmented reality,

82
0:04:00.085,000 --> 0:04:02,000
but to me, it's part of a much more important story --

83
0:04:03.512,000 --> 0:04:09,000
a story of how we can begin to extend our bodies with digital devices,

84
0:04:10.227,000 --> 0:04:12,000
instead of the other way around.

85
0:04:13.734,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Now ...

86
0:04:15.227,000 --> 0:04:18,000
in the next few years, humanity's going to go through a shift, I think.

87
0:04:18.613,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information

88
0:04:21.85,000 --> 0:04:22,000
on the real world.

89
0:04:24.05,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Just imagine for a moment

90
0:04:25.342,000 --> 0:04:27,000
what this could mean for storytellers,

91
0:04:27.626,000 --> 0:04:28,000
for painters,

92
0:04:28.965,000 --> 0:04:3,000
for brain surgeons,

93
0:04:31.147,000 --> 0:04:32,000
for interior decorators

94
0:04:32.988,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and maybe for all of us here today.

95
0:04:35.544,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And what I think we need to do as a community,

96
0:04:37.735,000 --> 0:04:38,000
is really try and make an effort

97
0:04:39.751,000 --> 0:04:41,000
to imagine how we can create this new reality

98
0:04:42.666,000 --> 0:04:44,000
in a way that extends the human experience,

99
0:04:45.388,000 --> 0:04:46,000
instead of gamifying our reality

100
0:04:47.38,000 --> 0:04:49,000
or cluttering it with digital information.

101
0:04:49.467,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And that's what I'm very passionate about.

102
0:04:52.318,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Now, I want to tell you a little secret.

103
0:04:54.503,000 --> 0:04:55,000
In about five years --

104
0:04:55.694,000 --> 0:04:56,000
this is not the smallest device --

105
0:04:57.344,000 --> 0:04:58,000
in about five years,

106
0:04:58.536,000 --> 0:05:,000
these are all going to look like strips of glass on our eyes

107
0:05:01.488,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that project holograms.

108
0:05:03.426,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And just like we don't care so much about which phone we buy

109
0:05:06.76,000 --> 0:05:09,000
in terms of the hardware -- we buy it for the operating system --

110
0:05:10.205,000 --> 0:05:11,000
as a neuroscientist,

111
0:05:11.388,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I always dreamt of building the iOS of the mind, if you will.

112
0:05:16.537,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And it's very, very important that we get this right,

113
0:05:19.441,000 --> 0:05:21,000
because we might be living inside of these things

114
0:05:21.759,000 --> 0:05:22,000
for at least as long as we've lived

115
0:05:23.471,000 --> 0:05:25,000
with the Windows graphical user interface.

116
0:05:26.136,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And I don't know about you,

117
0:05:27.477,000 --> 0:05:29,000
but living inside of Windows scares me.

118
0:05:30.009,000 --> 0:05:31,000
(Laughter)

119
0:05:31.353,000 --> 0:05:34,000
To isolate the single most intuitive interface out of infinity,

120
0:05:35.267,000 --> 0:05:37,000
we use neuroscience to drive our design guidelines,

121
0:05:37.971,000 --> 0:05:4,000
instead of letting a bunch of designers fight it out in the boardroom.

122
0:05:41.585,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And the principle we all revolve around

123
0:05:44.258,000 --> 0:05:47,000
is what's called the "Neural Path of Least Resistance."

124
0:05:47.29,000 --> 0:05:51,000
At every turn, we're connecting the iOS of the brain with our brain

125
0:05:51.445,000 --> 0:05:53,000
on, for the first time, our brain's terms.

126
0:05:53.855,000 --> 0:05:57,000
In other words, we're trying to create a zero learning-curve computer.

127
0:05:58.738,000 --> 0:06:01,000
We're building a system that you've always known how to use.

128
0:06:02.097,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Here are the first three design guidelines that we employ

129
0:06:05.014,000 --> 0:06:07,000
in this brand-new form of user experience.

130
0:06:07.369,000 --> 0:06:1,000
First and foremost, you are the operating system.

131
0:06:10.787,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract,

132
0:06:13.518,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and they take your brain extra steps to decode them.

133
0:06:16.133,000 --> 0:06:18,000
We're going against the Neural Path of Least Resistance.

134
0:06:18.962,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Meanwhile, in augmented reality,

135
0:06:21.184,000 --> 0:06:25,000
you can of course place your holographic TED panel over here,

136
0:06:26.183,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and your holographic email on the other side of the desk,

137
0:06:29.758,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and your spatial memory evolved just fine to go ahead and retrieve them.

138
0:06:35.605,000 --> 0:06:38,000
You could put your holographic Tesla that you're shopping for --

139
0:06:38.657,000 --> 0:06:41,000
or whatever model my legal team told me to put in right before the show.

140
0:06:42.186,000 --> 0:06:43,000
(Laughter)

141
0:06:43.212,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Perfect. And your brain knows exactly how to get it back.

142
0:06:45.968,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The second interface guideline we call "touch to see."

143
0:06:49.97,000 --> 0:06:53,000
What do babies do when they see something that grabs their interest?

144
0:06:54.712,000 --> 0:06:55,000
They try and reach out and touch it.

145
0:06:56.452,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And that's exactly how the natural machine should work as well.

146
0:07:00.439,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Turns out the visual system gets a fundamental boost

147
0:07:02.951,000 --> 0:07:04,000
from a sense we call proprioception --

148
0:07:05.384,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that's the sense of our body parts in space.

149
0:07:07.653,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So by touching our work directly, we're not only going to control it better,

150
0:07:11.487,000 --> 0:07:13,000
we're also going to understand it much more deeply.

151
0:07:14.637,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Hence, touch to see.

152
0:07:16.323,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But it's not enough to experience things ourselves.

153
0:07:18.742,000 --> 0:07:2,000
We're inherently these social primates.

154
0:07:20.993,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And this leads me to our third guideline,

155
0:07:23.129,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the holographic campfire from our first story.

156
0:07:26.537,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Our mirror-neuron subsystem suggests

157
0:07:28.475,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that we can connect with each other and with our work much better

158
0:07:32.047,000 --> 0:07:34,000
if we can see each other's faces and hands in 3D.

159
0:07:35.056,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So if you look at the video behind me,

160
0:07:36.917,000 --> 0:07:4,000
you can see two Meta users playing around with the same hologram,

161
0:07:41.25,000 --> 0:07:43,000
making eye contact, connected around this thing,

162
0:07:43.989,000 --> 0:07:45,000
instead of being distracted by external devices.

163
0:07:48.711,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Let's go ahead and try this again with neuroscience in mind.

164
0:07:56.127,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So again, our favorite interface, the iOS of the mind.

165
0:08:00.315,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I'm going to now take a step further

166
0:08:02.25,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and go ahead and grab this pair of glasses

167
0:08:05.024,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and leave it right here by the desk.

168
0:08:06.768,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I'm now with you, I'm in the moment,

169
0:08:08.514,000 --> 0:08:09,000
we're connecting.

170
0:08:09.69,000 --> 0:08:11,000
My spatial memory kicks in, and I can go ahead and grab it

171
0:08:12.632,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and bring it right back here, reminding me

172
0:08:14.757,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that I am the operating system.

173
0:08:16.667,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And now my proprioception is working,

174
0:08:19.071,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and I can go ahead and explode these glasses into a thousand parts

175
0:08:22.891,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and touch the very sensor that is currently scanning my hand.

176
0:08:27.305,000 --> 0:08:28,000
But it's not enough to see things alone,

177
0:08:29.29,000 --> 0:08:31,000
so in a second, my co-founder Ray is going to make a 3D call --

178
0:08:32.286,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Ray?

179
0:08:33.468,000 --> 0:08:34,000
(Ringing)

180
0:08:35.387,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Hey Ray, how's it going?

181
0:08:36.907,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Guys, I can see this guy in front me in full 3D.

182
0:08:40.359,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And he is photo-realistic.

183
0:08:42.68,000 --> 0:08:43,000
(Applause)

184
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Thank you.

185
0:08:45.176,000 --> 0:08:48,000
My mirror-neuron subsystem suggests that this is going to replace phones

186
0:08:49.181,000 --> 0:08:5,000
in not too long.

187
0:08:50.601,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Ray, how's it going?

188
0:08:52.443,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Ray: Great. We're live today.

189
0:08:54.832,000 --> 0:08:55,000
(Applause)

190
0:08:56.405,000 --> 0:08:58,000
MG: Ray, give the crowd a gift

191
0:08:58.541,000 --> 0:09:,000
of the holographic brain we saw from the video earlier.

192
0:09:01.2,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Guys, this is not only going to change phones,

193
0:09:03.382,000 --> 0:09:05,000
it's also going to change the way we collaborate.

194
0:09:06.7,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Thank you so much.

195
0:09:07.987,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Thanks, Ray.

196
0:09:09.169,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Ray: You're welcome.

197
0:09:10.344,000 --> 0:09:11,000
(Applause)

198
0:09:11.375,000 --> 0:09:15,000
MG: So folks, this is the message that I discovered in that bar in 2011:

199
0:09:16.347,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The future of computers is not locked inside one of these screens.

200
0:09:20.944,000 --> 0:09:22,000
It's right here, inside of us.

201
0:09:25.876,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Applause)

202
0:09:29.923,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So if there's one idea that I could leave you with here today,

203
0:09:32.86,000 --> 0:09:35,000
it's that the natural machine is not some figment of the future,

204
0:09:35.94,000 --> 0:09:37,000
it's right here in 2016.

205
0:09:38.447,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Which is why all hundred of us at Meta,

206
0:09:41.246,000 --> 0:09:42,000
including the administrative staff,

207
0:09:42.945,000 --> 0:09:43,000
the executives,

208
0:09:44.411,000 --> 0:09:45,000
the designers, the engineers --

209
0:09:46.158,000 --> 0:09:47,000
before TED2017,

210
0:09:48.084,000 --> 0:09:51,000
we're all going to be throwing away our external monitors

211
0:09:51.765,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and replacing them with a truly and profoundly more natural machine.

212
0:09:56.909,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Thank you very much.

213
0:09:58.124,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Applause)

214
0:10:02.079,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Thank you, appreciate it.

215
0:10:05.501,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Thanks, guys.

216
0:10:09.928,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Chris Anderson: So help me out on one thing,

217
0:10:12.796,000 --> 0:10:14,000
because there've been a few augmented reality demos

218
0:10:15.448,000 --> 0:10:17,000
shown over the last year or so out there.

219
0:10:18.178,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And there's sometimes a debate among technologists

220
0:10:20.611,000 --> 0:10:23,000
about, are we really seeing the real thing on-screen?

221
0:10:24.34,000 --> 0:10:25,000
There's this issue of field of view,

222
0:10:26.104,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that somehow the technology is showing a broader view

223
0:10:29.594,000 --> 0:10:31,000
than you would actually see wearing the glasses.

224
0:10:33.086,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Were we seeing the real deal there?

225
0:10:34.833,000 --> 0:10:35,000
MG: Absolutely the real deal.

226
0:10:36.27,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Not only that,

227
0:10:37.451,000 --> 0:10:4,000
we took extra measures to shoot it with a GoPro through the actual lens

228
0:10:40.812,000 --> 0:10:42,000
in the various videos that you've seen here.

229
0:10:42.889,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We want to try to simulate the experience for the world

230
0:10:45.489,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that we're actually seeing through the glasses,

231
0:10:47.706,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and not cut any corners.

232
0:10:48.881,000 --> 0:10:5,000
CA: Thank you so much for showing us that.

233
0:10:50.929,000 --> 0:10:51,000
MG: Thanks so much, I appreciate that.

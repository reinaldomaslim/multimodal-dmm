2
0:00:17.047,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I was sitting with my girls,

3
0:00:20.04,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and Joy said,

4
0:00:21.553,000 --> 0:00:24,000
"Dang, I wish he'd get off my back.

5
0:00:25.531,000 --> 0:00:28,000
My daddy, he calls me all the time."

6
0:00:29.387,000 --> 0:00:32,000
"Lucky for you he calls at all," said Jasmine.

7
0:00:32.653,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"I haven't heard from my dad in years."

8
0:00:36.313,000 --> 0:00:4,000
At this moment, I knew the girls needed a way

9
0:00:40.545,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to connect with their fathers.

10
0:00:43.122,000 --> 0:00:46,000
At Camp Diva, my non-profit organization,

11
0:00:46.885,000 --> 0:00:49,000
we have these types of conversations all the time

12
0:00:50.422,000 --> 0:00:53,000
as a way to help girls of African descent

13
0:00:53.614,000 --> 0:00:56,000
prepare for their passage into womanhood.

14
0:00:57.196,000 --> 0:01:,000
These girls just needed

15
0:01:00.737,000 --> 0:01:03,000
a way to invite their fathers into their lives

16
0:01:04.578,000 --> 0:01:06,000
on their own terms.

17
0:01:07.275,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So I asked the girls,

18
0:01:08.728,000 --> 0:01:11,000
"How can we help other girls

19
0:01:11.864,000 --> 0:01:15,000
develop healthy relationships with their fathers?"

20
0:01:16.154,000 --> 0:01:2,000
"Let's have a dance," one girl shouted,

21
0:01:20.657,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and all the girls quickly backed her up.

22
0:01:24.99,000 --> 0:01:26,000
They started dreaming about the decorations,

23
0:01:27.896,000 --> 0:01:3,000
invitations, the dresses they were going to wear,

24
0:01:31.31,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and what their fathers could and could not wear. (Laughter)

25
0:01:35.456,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It was off and running before I could even blink my eyes,

26
0:01:40.027,000 --> 0:01:44,000
but even if I could have slowed down those girls,

27
0:01:44.097,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I wouldn't have,

28
0:01:45.437,000 --> 0:01:47,000
because one thing that I have learned

29
0:01:47.518,000 --> 0:01:5,000
from over a decade of working with girls

30
0:01:50.596,000 --> 0:01:53,000
is that they already know what they need.

31
0:01:54.116,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The wisdom lives inside of them.

32
0:01:58.793,000 --> 0:02:,000
As long as they have infrastructure,

33
0:02:01.441,000 --> 0:02:03,000
mentorship and resources,

34
0:02:03.857,000 --> 0:02:06,000
they can build what they need,

35
0:02:07.275,000 --> 0:02:12,000
not only to survive, but to thrive.

36
0:02:12.709,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So we had a dance,

37
0:02:16.933,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and girls and their fathers came in multitudes.

38
0:02:21.473,000 --> 0:02:23,000
They were dressed to the nines.

39
0:02:24.448,000 --> 0:02:26,000
They acted sweet.

40
0:02:26.691,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:30.377,000 --> 0:02:31,000
They acted silly.

42
0:02:32.227,000 --> 0:02:35,000
They really enjoyed each other's company.

43
0:02:35.448,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It was a huge success.

44
0:02:38.289,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And the girls decided to make it an annual event.

45
0:02:43.5,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So as the seasons changed,

46
0:02:46.092,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and it was time to plan the dance again,

47
0:02:48.812,000 --> 0:02:51,000
one girl named Brianna spoke up,

48
0:02:51.919,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and she said,

49
0:02:54.109,000 --> 0:02:56,000
"My dad can't come to the dance,

50
0:02:56.855,000 --> 0:03:,000
and this whole thing is making me sad."

51
0:03:01.092,000 --> 0:03:04,000
"Why not?" the girls asked.

52
0:03:04.1,000 --> 0:03:08,000
"Because he's in jail," she bravely admitted.

53
0:03:08.78,000 --> 0:03:12,000
"Well, can he just get out for a day?" one of the girls asked. (Laughter)

54
0:03:13.714,000 --> 0:03:16,000
"And come in shackles?

55
0:03:16.892,000 --> 0:03:2,000
That's worse than not having him here at all."

56
0:03:21.237,000 --> 0:03:25,000
At this moment, I saw an opportunity

57
0:03:25.655,000 --> 0:03:27,000
for the girls to rise to the occasion

58
0:03:28.581,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and to become their own heroes.

59
0:03:31.345,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So I asked, "What do you think we should do about this?

60
0:03:36.018,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We want every girl to experience the dance, right?"

61
0:03:41.268,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So the girls thought for a moment,

62
0:03:42.931,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and one girl suggested,

63
0:03:45.24,000 --> 0:03:49,000
"Why don't we just take the dance in the jail?"

64
0:03:49.546,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Most of the girls doubted the possibility of that,

65
0:03:53.362,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and said, "Are you crazy?

66
0:03:56.156,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Who is going to allow a bunch of little girls,

67
0:03:59.164,000 --> 0:04:01,000
dressed up — " (Laughter)

68
0:04:01.628,000 --> 0:04:06,000
" — to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in Spongebob suits?"

69
0:04:07.215,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Because that's what they called them.

70
0:04:10.563,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I said, "Girls, well, well,

71
0:04:14.721,000 --> 0:04:18,000
you never know unless you ask."

72
0:04:18.724,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So a letter was written to the Richmond City Sheriff,

73
0:04:23.164,000 --> 0:04:26,000
signed collectively by each girl,

74
0:04:26.983,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and I would have to say, he is a very special sheriff.

75
0:04:32.389,000 --> 0:04:36,000
He contacted me immediately and said,

76
0:04:37.322,000 --> 0:04:42,000
whenever there is an opportunity to bring families inside,

77
0:04:43.276,000 --> 0:04:46,000
his doors are always open.

78
0:04:46.448,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Because one thing he did know,

79
0:04:48.773,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that when fathers are connected to their children,

80
0:04:52.1,000 --> 0:04:56,000
it is less likely that they will return.

81
0:04:57.063,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So,

82
0:04:59.144,000 --> 0:05:04,000
16 inmates and 18 girls were invited.

83
0:05:04.998,000 --> 0:05:07,000
The girls were dressed in their Sunday best,

84
0:05:08.647,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and the fathers traded in their yellow and blue jumpsuits

85
0:05:13.676,000 --> 0:05:17,000
for shirts and ties.

86
0:05:18.18,000 --> 0:05:2,000
They hugged.

87
0:05:20.551,000 --> 0:05:24,000
They shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish.

88
0:05:25.302,000 --> 0:05:28,000
They laughed together.

89
0:05:29.027,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It was beautiful.

90
0:05:33.435,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The fathers and daughters even experienced

91
0:05:37.676,000 --> 0:05:41,000
an opportunity to have a physical connection,

92
0:05:41.751,000 --> 0:05:43,000
something that a lot of them didn't even have

93
0:05:44.48,000 --> 0:05:45,000
for a while.

94
0:05:45.712,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Fathers were in a space where they were able to

95
0:05:50.123,000 --> 0:05:52,000
make their daughter's plate,

96
0:05:52.836,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and pull out her chair and extend his hand for a dance.

97
0:05:59.085,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Even the guards cried.

98
0:06:02.762,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But after the dance,

99
0:06:05.482,000 --> 0:06:1,000
we all realized that Dad still would be in jail.

100
0:06:11.042,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So we needed to create something

101
0:06:14.135,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that they could take with them.

102
0:06:15.893,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So we brought in Flip cams,

103
0:06:18.508,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and we had them look at the Flip cams

104
0:06:21.249,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and just interview each other --

105
0:06:22.977,000 --> 0:06:25,000
their messages, their thoughts.

106
0:06:26.691,000 --> 0:06:29,000
This was going to be used as a touchstone

107
0:06:29.874,000 --> 0:06:31,000
so when they started to miss each other

108
0:06:32.29,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and feel disconnected,

109
0:06:34.59,000 --> 0:06:37,000
they could reconnect through this image.

110
0:06:37.954,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I'll never forget that one girl looked in her father's eyes

111
0:06:43.336,000 --> 0:06:44,000
with that camera and said,

112
0:06:44.656,000 --> 0:06:5,000
"Daddy, when you look at me, what do you see?"

113
0:06:51.366,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Because our daddies are our mirrors

114
0:06:55.454,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that we reflect back on

115
0:06:57.876,000 --> 0:07:01,000
when we decide about what type of man we deserve,

116
0:07:02.646,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and how they see us for the rest of our lives.

117
0:07:06.237,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I know that very well,

118
0:07:09.782,000 --> 0:07:11,000
because I was one of the lucky girls.

119
0:07:12.183,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I have had

120
0:07:18.058,000 --> 0:07:24,000
my father in my life always.

121
0:07:24.065,000 --> 0:07:25,000
He's even here today.

122
0:07:25.945,000 --> 0:07:34,000
(Applause)

123
0:07:34.982,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And that is why it is extremely special

124
0:07:38.96,000 --> 0:07:41,000
for me to make sure that these girls

125
0:07:42.204,000 --> 0:07:44,000
are connected to their fathers,

126
0:07:44.734,000 --> 0:07:46,000
especially those who are separated

127
0:07:47.643,000 --> 0:07:51,000
because of barbed wires and metal doors.

128
0:07:52.529,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We have just created a form

129
0:07:55.622,000 --> 0:07:58,000
for girls who have heavy questions on their heart

130
0:07:59.005,000 --> 0:08:03,000
to be in a position to ask their fathers those questions

131
0:08:03.497,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and given the fathers the freedom to answer.

132
0:08:08.264,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Because we know that the fathers

133
0:08:11.609,000 --> 0:08:14,000
are even leaving with this one thought:

134
0:08:14.857,000 --> 0:08:19,000
What type of woman am I preparing to put in the world?

135
0:08:20.226,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Because a father is locked in

136
0:08:23.643,000 --> 0:08:26,000
does not mean he should be locked out

137
0:08:26.693,000 --> 0:08:28,000
of his daughter's life.

138
0:08:29.244,000 --> 0:08:4,000
(Applause)

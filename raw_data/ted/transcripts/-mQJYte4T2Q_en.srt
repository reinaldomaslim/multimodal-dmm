0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
What I wanted to talk to you about today is two things:

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
one, the rise of a culture of availability;

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and two, a request.

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
So we're seeing a rise of this availability

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
being driven by mobile device proliferation,

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
globally, across all social strata.

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
We're seeing, along with that proliferation of mobile devices,

8
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
an expectation of availability.

9
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And, with that, comes the third point,

10
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
which is obligation -- and an obligation to that availability.

11
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And the problem is, we're still working through,

12
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
from a societal standpoint,

13
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
how we allow people to be available.

14
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
There's a significant delta, in fact,

15
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
between what we're willing to accept.

16
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Apologies to Hans Rosling --

17
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
he said anything that's not using real stats is a lie --

18
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but the big delta there

19
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
is how we deal with this from a public standpoint.

20
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So we've developed certain tactics and strategies

21
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to cover up.

22
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
This first one's called "the lean."

23
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And if you've ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting "chicken,"

24
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
you're sitting there, looking at the person, waiting for them to look away,

25
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and then quickly checking the device.

26
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Although you can see the gentleman up on the right is busting him.

27
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
"The stretch."

28
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
OK, the gentleman on the left is saying, "Screw you,

29
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I'm going to check my device."

30
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But the guy, here, on the right,

31
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
he's doing the stretch.

32
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It's that reeeee-e-e-each out, the physical contortion

33
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to get that device just below the tabletop.

34
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Or, my favorite, the "Love you; mean it."

35
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Nothing says "I love you"

37
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
like "Let me find somebody else I give a damn about."

38
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Or, this one, coming to us from India.

39
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
You can find this on YouTube,

40
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
the gentleman who's recumbent on a motorcycle

41
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
while text messaging.

42
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Or what we call the "sweet gravy, stop me before I kill again!"

43
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
That is actually the device.

44
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
What this is doing is, we find a --

45
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

46
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
a direct collision --

47
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
we find a direct collision between availability --

48
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and what's possible through availability --

49
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and a fundamental human need -- which we've been hearing about a lot, actually --

50
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
the need to create shared narratives.

51
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We're very good at creating personal narratives,

52
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
but it's the shared narratives that make us a culture.

53
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And when you're standing with someone,

54
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and you're on your mobile device,

55
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
effectively what you're saying to them is,

56
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
"You are not as important as, literally,

57
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
almost anything that could come to me through this device."

58
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Look around you.

59
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
There might be somebody on one right now,

60
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
participating in multi-dimensional engagement.

61
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

62
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Our reality right now is less interesting

63
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
than the story we're going to tell about it later.

64
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
This one I love.

65
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
This poor kid, clearly a prop --

66
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
don't get me wrong, a willing prop --

67
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
but the kiss that's being documented kind of looks like it sucks.

68
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
This is the sound of one hand clapping.

69
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So, as we lose the context of our identity,

70
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
it becomes incredibly important

71
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative,

72
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
becomes the context in which we live.

73
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The stories that we tell -- what we push out --

74
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
becomes who we are.

75
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
People aren't simply projecting identity,

76
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
they're creating it.

77
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And so that's the request I have for everybody in this room.

78
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We are creating the technology

79
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that is going to create the new shared experience,

80
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
which will create the new world.

81
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And so my request is,

82
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
please, let's make technologies

83
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that make people more human,

84
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and not less.

85
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Thank you.

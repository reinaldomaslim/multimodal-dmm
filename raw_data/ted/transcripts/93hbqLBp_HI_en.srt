1
0:00:12.4,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Three years ago, I was standing about a hundred yards

2
0:00:15.489,000 --> 0:00:18,000
from Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four.

3
0:00:19.115,000 --> 0:00:22,000
My Geiger counter dosimeter, which measures radiation,

4
0:00:22.262,000 --> 0:00:23,000
was going berserk,

5
0:00:23.85,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and the closer I got, the more frenetic it became,

6
0:00:27.297,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and frantic. My God.

7
0:00:30.093,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I was there covering the 25th anniversary

8
0:00:32.843,000 --> 0:00:35,000
of the world's worst nuclear accident,

9
0:00:35.993,000 --> 0:00:36,000
as you can see by the look on my face,

10
0:00:37.942,000 --> 0:00:39,000
reluctantly so, but with good reason,

11
0:00:40.833,000 --> 0:00:43,000
because the nuclear fire that burned for 11 days

12
0:00:44.296,000 --> 0:00:48,000
back in 1986 released 400 times as much radiation

13
0:00:48.712,000 --> 0:00:5,000
as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima,

14
0:00:50.928,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and the sarcophagus, which is the covering

15
0:00:53.402,000 --> 0:00:54,000
over reactor number four,

16
0:00:54.979,000 --> 0:00:56,000
which was hastily built 27 years ago,

17
0:00:57.861,000 --> 0:00:58,000
now sits cracked and rusted

18
0:00:59.779,000 --> 0:01:,000
and leaking radiation.

19
0:01:01.495,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So I was filming.

20
0:01:03.173,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I just wanted to get the job done

21
0:01:04.479,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and get out of there fast.

22
0:01:07.066,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But then, I looked into the distance,

23
0:01:09.35,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and I saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse,

24
0:01:12.627,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and I'm thinking, who could be living here?

25
0:01:15.17,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I mean, after all, Chernobyl's soil, water and air,

26
0:01:18.762,000 --> 0:01:2,000
are among the most highly contaminated on Earth,

27
0:01:21.472,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and the reactor sits at the the center of

28
0:01:23.09,000 --> 0:01:26,000
a tightly regulated exclusion zone, or dead zone,

29
0:01:26.736,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and it's a nuclear police state, complete with border guards.

30
0:01:30.081,000 --> 0:01:32,000
You have to have dosimeter at all times, clicking away,

31
0:01:32.628,000 --> 0:01:33,000
you have to have a government minder,

32
0:01:34.549,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and there's draconian radiation rules

33
0:01:37.185,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and constant contamination monitoring.

34
0:01:41.89,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The point being, no human being

35
0:01:44.042,000 --> 0:01:46,000
should be living anywhere near the dead zone.

36
0:01:46.928,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But they are.

37
0:01:48.521,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It turns out an unlikely community

38
0:01:51.174,000 --> 0:01:54,000
of some 200 people are living inside the zone.

39
0:01:54.627,000 --> 0:01:55,000
They're called self-settlers.

40
0:01:56.485,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And almost all of them are women,

41
0:01:59.125,000 --> 0:02:,000
the men having shorter lifespans

42
0:02:00.993,000 --> 0:02:02,000
in part due to overuse of alcohol, cigarettes,

43
0:02:03.31,000 --> 0:02:04,000
if not radiation.

44
0:02:05.298,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated

45
0:02:07.536,000 --> 0:02:08,000
at the time of the accident,

46
0:02:09.156,000 --> 0:02:11,000
but not everybody accepted that fate.

47
0:02:11.617,000 --> 0:02:13,000
The women in the zone, now in their 70s and 80s,

48
0:02:14.41,000 --> 0:02:16,000
are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities

49
0:02:17.405,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and, it would seem, common sense,

50
0:02:19.355,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone.

51
0:02:23.045,000 --> 0:02:25,000
They did so illegally.

52
0:02:25.529,000 --> 0:02:26,000
As one woman put it to a soldier

53
0:02:27.446,000 --> 0:02:29,000
who was trying to evacuate her for a second time,

54
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
"Shoot me and dig the grave.

55
0:02:32.083,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Otherwise, I'm going home."

56
0:02:34.661,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Now why would they return to such deadly soil?

57
0:02:37.196,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I mean, were they unaware of the risks

58
0:02:39.104,000 --> 0:02:42,000
or crazy enough to ignore them, or both?

59
0:02:42.115,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The thing is, they see their lives

60
0:02:43.587,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and the risks they run decidedly differently.

61
0:02:47.119,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Now around Chernobyl, there are scattered ghost villages,

62
0:02:50.372,000 --> 0:02:54,000
eerily silent, strangely charming, bucolic,

63
0:02:54.703,000 --> 0:02:55,000
totally contaminated.

64
0:02:56.626,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Many were bulldozed under at the time of the accident,

65
0:02:59.765,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but a few are left like this,

66
0:03:01.798,000 --> 0:03:04,000
kind of silent vestiges to the tragedy.

67
0:03:05.351,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Others have a few residents in them,

68
0:03:07.662,000 --> 0:03:09,000
one or two "babushkas," or "babas,"

69
0:03:10.127,000 --> 0:03:13,000
which are the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother.

70
0:03:13.316,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Another village might have six or seven residents.

71
0:03:16.399,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So this is the strange demographic of the zone --

72
0:03:19.129,000 --> 0:03:21,000
isolated alone together.

73
0:03:21.998,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And when I made my way to that piping chimney

74
0:03:24.201,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I'd seen in the distance,

75
0:03:25.872,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I saw Hanna Zavorotnya, and I met her.

76
0:03:29.118,000 --> 0:03:32,000
She's the self-declared mayor of Kapavati village,

77
0:03:32.184,000 --> 0:03:33,000
population eight.

78
0:03:34.146,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Laughter)

79
0:03:36.109,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And she said to me, when I asked her the obvious,

80
0:03:39.342,000 --> 0:03:43,000
"Radiation doesn't scare me. Starvation does."

81
0:03:43.351,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And you have to remember, these women have

82
0:03:44.984,000 --> 0:03:47,000
survived the worst atrocities of the 20th century.

83
0:03:48.852,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Stalin's enforced famines of the 1930s, the Holodomor,

84
0:03:52.423,000 --> 0:03:53,000
killed millions of Ukrainians,

85
0:03:54.254,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and they faced the Nazis in the '40s,

86
0:03:56.277,000 --> 0:03:58,000
who came through slashing, burning, raping,

87
0:03:59.253,000 --> 0:04:,000
and in fact many of these women

88
0:04:00.869,000 --> 0:04:03,000
were shipped to Germany as forced labor.

89
0:04:03.954,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So when a couple decades into Soviet rule,

90
0:04:06.414,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Chernobyl happened,

91
0:04:07.609,000 --> 0:04:1,000
they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy

92
0:04:10.671,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that was invisible.

93
0:04:12.849,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So they returned to their villages

94
0:04:14.838,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and are told they're going to get sick and die soon,

95
0:04:18.058,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but five happy years, their logic goes,

96
0:04:20.623,000 --> 0:04:22,000
is better than 10 stuck in a high rise

97
0:04:23.178,000 --> 0:04:24,000
on the outskirts of Kiev,

98
0:04:25.038,000 --> 0:04:27,000
separated from the graves of their mothers

99
0:04:27.216,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and fathers and babies,

100
0:04:29.536,000 --> 0:04:32,000
the whisper of stork wings on a spring afternoon.

101
0:04:33.492,000 --> 0:04:35,000
For them, environmental contamination

102
0:04:35.89,000 --> 0:04:37,000
may not be the worst sort of devastation.

103
0:04:38.44,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It turns out this holds true

104
0:04:39.76,000 --> 0:04:41,000
for other species as well.

105
0:04:41.851,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Wild boar, lynx, moose, they've all returned

106
0:04:44.798,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to the region in force,

107
0:04:46.548,000 --> 0:04:49,000
the very real, very negative effects of radiation

108
0:04:49.803,000 --> 0:04:52,000
being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus

109
0:04:53.361,000 --> 0:04:54,000
of humans.

110
0:04:55.112,000 --> 0:04:59,000
The dead zone, it turns out, is full of life.

111
0:04:59.805,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And there is a kind of heroic resilience,

112
0:05:02.863,000 --> 0:05:04,000
a kind of plain-spoken pragmatism to those

113
0:05:05.734,000 --> 0:05:07,000
who start their day at 5 a.m.

114
0:05:08.226,000 --> 0:05:1,000
pulling water from a well

115
0:05:10.469,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and end it at midnight

116
0:05:12.173,000 --> 0:05:14,000
poised to beat a bucket with a stick

117
0:05:14.237,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes,

118
0:05:17.137,000 --> 0:05:22,000
their only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka.

119
0:05:22.289,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And there's a patina of simple defiance among them.

120
0:05:25.699,000 --> 0:05:28,000
"They told us our legs would hurt, and they do. So what?"

121
0:05:29.537,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I mean, what about their health?

122
0:05:31.239,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The benefits of hardy, physical living,

123
0:05:34.061,000 --> 0:05:35,000
but an environment made toxic

124
0:05:35.665,000 --> 0:05:38,000
by a complicated, little-understood enemy, radiation.

125
0:05:39.648,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It's incredibly difficult to parse.

126
0:05:41.783,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Health studies from the region

127
0:05:43.6,000 --> 0:05:45,000
are conflicting and fraught.

128
0:05:46.34,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The World Health Organization

129
0:05:47.733,000 --> 0:05:49,000
puts the number of Chernobyl-related deaths

130
0:05:50.463,000 --> 0:05:52,000
at 4,000, eventually.

131
0:05:52.781,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Greenpeace and other organizations

132
0:05:55.419,000 --> 0:05:58,000
put that number in the tens of thousands.

133
0:05:58.577,000 --> 0:06:,000
Now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers

134
0:06:01.569,000 --> 0:06:03,000
are sky high, and that Chernobyl evacuees

135
0:06:04.186,000 --> 0:06:07,000
suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere:

136
0:06:07.253,000 --> 0:06:1,000
higher levels of anxiety, depression, alcoholism,

137
0:06:10.531,000 --> 0:06:12,000
unemployment and, importantly,

138
0:06:12.711,000 --> 0:06:15,000
disrupted social networks.

139
0:06:15.954,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Now, like many of you,

140
0:06:18.36,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I have moved maybe 20, 25 times in my life.

141
0:06:22.985,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Home is a transient concept.

142
0:06:26.407,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I have a deeper connection to my laptop

143
0:06:28.584,000 --> 0:06:32,000
than any bit of soil.

144
0:06:32.926,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So it's hard for us to understand, but home

145
0:06:35.165,000 --> 0:06:38,000
is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka,

146
0:06:38.338,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and connection to the land is palpable.

147
0:06:41.794,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And perhaps because these Ukrainian women

148
0:06:43.585,000 --> 0:06:45,000
were schooled under the Soviets

149
0:06:45.588,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and versed in the Russian poets,

150
0:06:47.83,000 --> 0:06:48,000
aphorisms about these ideas

151
0:06:49.388,000 --> 0:06:51,000
slip from their mouths all the time.

152
0:06:51.585,000 --> 0:06:54,000
"If you leave, you die."

153
0:06:54.592,000 --> 0:06:55,000
"Those who left are worse off now.

154
0:06:56.559,000 --> 0:06:57,000
They are dying of sadness."

155
0:06:58.2,000 --> 0:07:02,000
"Motherland is motherland. I will never leave."

156
0:07:02.687,000 --> 0:07:05,000
What sounds like faith, soft faith,

157
0:07:05.943,000 --> 0:07:08,000
may actually be fact,

158
0:07:09.068,000 --> 0:07:1,000
because the surprising truth --

159
0:07:10.69,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I mean, there are no studies, but the truth seems to be

160
0:07:13.076,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that these women who returned to their homes

161
0:07:15.648,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and have lived on some of the most radioactive land

162
0:07:17.728,000 --> 0:07:19,000
on Earth for the last 27 years,

163
0:07:19.934,000 --> 0:07:21,000
have actually outlived their counterparts

164
0:07:22.289,000 --> 0:07:24,000
who accepted relocation,

165
0:07:24.336,000 --> 0:07:28,000
by some estimates up to 10 years.

166
0:07:28.462,000 --> 0:07:3,000
How could this be?

167
0:07:30.642,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Here's a theory: Could it be

168
0:07:32.341,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that those ties to ancestral soil,

169
0:07:35.406,000 --> 0:07:37,000
the soft variables reflected in their aphorisms,

170
0:07:37.972,000 --> 0:07:39,000
actually affect longevity?

171
0:07:40.836,000 --> 0:07:41,000
The power of motherland

172
0:07:42.595,000 --> 0:07:44,000
so fundamental to that part of the world

173
0:07:45.053,000 --> 0:07:46,000
seems palliative.

174
0:07:46.865,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Home and community are forces

175
0:07:49.662,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that rival even radiation.

176
0:07:53.722,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Now radiation or not,

177
0:07:56.2,000 --> 0:07:58,000
these women are at the end of their lives.

178
0:07:58.804,000 --> 0:08:01,000
In the next decade, the zone's human residents will be gone,

179
0:08:02.797,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and it will revert to a wild, radioactive place,

180
0:08:07.024,000 --> 0:08:1,000
full only of animals and occasionally

181
0:08:10.138,000 --> 0:08:13,000
daring, flummoxed scientists.

182
0:08:13.23,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But the spirit and existence of the babushkas,

183
0:08:16.332,000 --> 0:08:17,000
whose numbers have been halved

184
0:08:18.039,000 --> 0:08:2,000
in the three years I've known them,

185
0:08:20.181,000 --> 0:08:22,000
will leave us with powerful new templates

186
0:08:22.379,000 --> 0:08:24,000
to think about and grapple with,

187
0:08:24.395,000 --> 0:08:27,000
about the relative nature of risk,

188
0:08:28.058,000 --> 0:08:31,000
about transformative connections to home,

189
0:08:31.905,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and about the magnificent tonic

190
0:08:35.451,000 --> 0:08:38,000
of personal agency and self-determination.

191
0:08:39.304,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Thank you.

192
0:08:41.239,000 --> 0:08:45,000
(Applause)

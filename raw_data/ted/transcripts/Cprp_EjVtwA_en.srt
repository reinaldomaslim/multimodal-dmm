1
0:00:12.813,000 --> 0:00:14,000
On a warm August morning in Harare,

2
0:00:16.336,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Farai,

3
0:00:18.55,000 --> 0:00:2,000
a 24-year-old mother of two,

4
0:00:21.144,000 --> 0:00:23,000
walks towards a park bench.

5
0:00:24.765,000 --> 0:00:27,000
She looks miserable and dejected.

6
0:00:28.581,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Now, on the park bench sits an 82-year-old woman,

7
0:00:33.928,000 --> 0:00:36,000
better known to the community as Grandmother Jack.

8
0:00:39.392,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Farai hands Grandmother Jack an envelope from the clinic nurse.

9
0:00:47.373,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Grandmother Jack invites Farai to sit down

10
0:00:50.409,000 --> 0:00:53,000
as she opens the envelope and reads.

11
0:00:53.817,000 --> 0:00:56,000
There's silence for three minutes or so as she reads.

12
0:00:58.899,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And after a long pause, Grandmother Jack takes a deep breath,

13
0:01:02.989,000 --> 0:01:04,000
looks at Farai and says,

14
0:01:06.64,000 --> 0:01:07,000
"I'm here for you.

15
0:01:10.463,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Would you like to share your story with me?"

16
0:01:13.53,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Farai begins,

17
0:01:15.392,000 --> 0:01:17,000
her eyes swelling with tears.

18
0:01:19.383,000 --> 0:01:21,000
She says, "Grandmother Jack,

19
0:01:22.092,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I'm HIV-positive.

20
0:01:24.721,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I've been living with HIV for the past four years.

21
0:01:28.019,000 --> 0:01:3,000
My husband left me a year ago.

22
0:01:30.645,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I have two kids

23
0:01:32.683,000 --> 0:01:33,000
under the age of five.

24
0:01:34.343,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I'm unemployed.

25
0:01:35.981,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I can hardly take care of my children."

26
0:01:40.211,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Tears are now flowing down her face.

27
0:01:43.252,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And in response, Grandmother Jack moves closer,

28
0:01:47.375,000 --> 0:01:48,000
puts her hand on Farai,

29
0:01:49.353,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and says, "Farai, it's OK to cry.

30
0:01:53.8,000 --> 0:01:54,000
You've been through a lot.

31
0:01:56.453,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Would you like to share more with me?"

32
0:01:59.06,000 --> 0:02:,000
And Farai continues.

33
0:02:02.14,000 --> 0:02:03,000
"In the last three weeks,

34
0:02:04.666,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I have had recurrent thoughts of killing myself,

35
0:02:09.603,000 --> 0:02:11,000
taking my two children with me.

36
0:02:12.717,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I can't take it anymore.

37
0:02:15.154,000 --> 0:02:19,000
The clinic nurse sent me to see you."

38
0:02:20.304,000 --> 0:02:24,000
There's an exchange between the two, which lasts about 30 minutes.

39
0:02:25.128,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And finally, Grandmother Jack says,

40
0:02:28.569,000 --> 0:02:29,000
"Farai,

41
0:02:30.533,000 --> 0:02:35,000
it seems to me that you have all the symptoms of kufungisisa."

42
0:02:37.778,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The word "kufungisisa" opens up a floodgate of tears.

43
0:02:44.497,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So, kufungisisa is the local equivalent of depression

44
0:02:48.777,000 --> 0:02:49,000
in my country.

45
0:02:50.776,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It literally means

46
0:02:52.837,000 --> 0:02:53,000
"thinking too much."

47
0:02:56.035,000 --> 0:02:59,000
The World Health Organization estimates

48
0:02:59.468,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that more than 300 million people globally, today, suffer from depression,

49
0:03:05.601,000 --> 0:03:07,000
or what in my country we call kufungisisa.

50
0:03:08.966,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And the World Health Organization also tells us

51
0:03:12.036,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that every 40 seconds,

52
0:03:15.177,000 --> 0:03:19,000
someone somewhere in the world commits suicide

53
0:03:19.251,000 --> 0:03:2,000
because they are unhappy,

54
0:03:21.055,000 --> 0:03:24,000
largely due to depression or kufungisisa.

55
0:03:24.636,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And most of these deaths are occurring in low- and middle-income countries.

56
0:03:29.395,000 --> 0:03:3,000
In fact,

57
0:03:30.645,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the World Health Organization goes as far as to say

58
0:03:34.425,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that when you look at the age group between 15 to 29,

59
0:03:38.357,000 --> 0:03:42,000
a leading cause of death now is actually suicide.

60
0:03:43.849,000 --> 0:03:46,000
But there are wider events that lead to depression

61
0:03:47.529,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and in some cases, suicide,

62
0:03:49.348,000 --> 0:03:5,000
such as abuse,

63
0:03:51.151,000 --> 0:03:53,000
conflict, violence,

64
0:03:53.865,000 --> 0:03:55,000
isolation, loneliness --

65
0:03:56.232,000 --> 0:03:57,000
the list is endless.

66
0:03:59.594,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But one thing that we do know

67
0:04:01.934,000 --> 0:04:04,000
is that depression can be treated and suicides averted.

68
0:04:06.401,000 --> 0:04:07,000
But the problem is

69
0:04:07.581,000 --> 0:04:1,000
we just don't have enough psychiatrists or psychologists in the world

70
0:04:11.055,000 --> 0:04:12,000
to do the job.

71
0:04:12.437,000 --> 0:04:15,000
In most low- and middle-income countries, for instance,

72
0:04:15.485,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the ratio of psychiatrists to the population

73
0:04:18.289,000 --> 0:04:22,000
is something like one for every one and a half million people,

74
0:04:22.473,000 --> 0:04:25,000
which literally means that 90 percent of the people

75
0:04:26.074,000 --> 0:04:28,000
needing mental health services

76
0:04:28.118,000 --> 0:04:29,000
will not get it.

77
0:04:30.039,000 --> 0:04:31,000
In my country,

78
0:04:31.918,000 --> 0:04:33,000
there are 12 psychiatrists,

79
0:04:34.571,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and I'm one of them,

80
0:04:36.414,000 --> 0:04:39,000
for a population of approximately 14 million.

81
0:04:40.352,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Now, let me just put that into context.

82
0:04:43.107,000 --> 0:04:45,000
One evening while I was at home,

83
0:04:46.319,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I get a call from the ER,

84
0:04:48.991,000 --> 0:04:49,000
or the emergency room,

85
0:04:51.308,000 --> 0:04:54,000
from a city which is some 200 kilometers away

86
0:04:54.908,000 --> 0:04:55,000
from where I live.

87
0:04:56.197,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And the ER doctor says,

88
0:04:57.869,000 --> 0:04:58,000
"One of your patients,

89
0:04:59.082,000 --> 0:05:,000
someone you treated four months ago,

90
0:05:01.44,000 --> 0:05:02,000
has just taken an overdose,

91
0:05:03.196,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and they are in the ER department.

92
0:05:05.673,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Hemodynamically, they seem to be OK,

93
0:05:07.833,000 --> 0:05:1,000
but they will need neuropsychiatric evaluation."

94
0:05:11.619,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now, I obviously can't get into my car in the middle of the night

95
0:05:14.968,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and drive 200 kilometers.

96
0:05:16.713,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So as best as we could,

97
0:05:18.983,000 --> 0:05:2,000
over the phone with the ER doctor,

98
0:05:21.419,000 --> 0:05:23,000
we come up with an assessment.

99
0:05:24.148,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We ensure that suicidal observations are in place.

100
0:05:29.162,000 --> 0:05:32,000
We ensure that we start reviewing the antidepressants

101
0:05:32.434,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that this patient has been taking,

102
0:05:34.722,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and we finally conclude

103
0:05:37.36,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that as soon as Erica -- that was her name, 26-year-old --

104
0:05:40.781,000 --> 0:05:43,000
as soon as Erica is ready to be released from the ER,

105
0:05:44.718,000 --> 0:05:46,000
she should come directly to me with her mother,

106
0:05:47.352,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and I will evaluate

107
0:05:49.327,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and establish what can be done.

108
0:05:51.142,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And we assumed that that would take about a week.

109
0:05:54.994,000 --> 0:05:55,000
A week passes.

110
0:05:56.428,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Three weeks pass.

111
0:05:57.884,000 --> 0:05:58,000
No Erica.

112
0:05:59.558,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And one day I get a call from Erica's mother,

113
0:06:02.488,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and she says,

114
0:06:04.853,000 --> 0:06:06,000
"Erica committed suicide three days ago.

115
0:06:07.894,000 --> 0:06:1,000
She hanged herself from the mango tree

116
0:06:12.645,000 --> 0:06:13,000
in the family garden."

117
0:06:16.417,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Now, almost like a knee-jerk reaction,

118
0:06:19.614,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I couldn't help but ask,

119
0:06:21.911,000 --> 0:06:24,000
"But why didn't you come to Harare, where I live?

120
0:06:25.043,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We had agreed that as soon as you're released from the ER,

121
0:06:28.236,000 --> 0:06:29,000
you will come to me."

122
0:06:30.29,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Her response was brief.

123
0:06:34.056,000 --> 0:06:37,000
"We didn't have the 15 dollars bus fare

124
0:06:37.652,000 --> 0:06:38,000
to come to Harare."

125
0:06:40.412,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Now, suicide is not an unusual event

126
0:06:44.228,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in the world of mental health.

127
0:06:47.101,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But there was something about Erica's death

128
0:06:49.748,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that struck me at the core of my very being.

129
0:06:54.367,000 --> 0:06:56,000
That statement from Erica's mother:

130
0:06:57.766,000 --> 0:07:01,000
"We didn't have 15 dollars bus fare to come to you,"

131
0:07:03.103,000 --> 0:07:04,000
made me realize

132
0:07:05.784,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that it just wasn't going to work,

133
0:07:07.949,000 --> 0:07:09,000
me expecting people to come to me.

134
0:07:10.813,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And I got into this state of soul-searching,

135
0:07:14.57,000 --> 0:07:17,000
trying to really discover my role

136
0:07:18.199,000 --> 0:07:21,000
as a psychiatrist in Africa.

137
0:07:21.252,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And after considerable consultation and soul-searching,

138
0:07:25.823,000 --> 0:07:28,000
talking to colleagues, friends and family,

139
0:07:28.951,000 --> 0:07:3,000
it suddenly dawned on me

140
0:07:31.106,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that actually, one the most reliable resources we have in Africa

141
0:07:36.892,000 --> 0:07:37,000
are grandmothers.

142
0:07:39.707,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Yes, grandmothers.

143
0:07:41.661,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And I thought,

144
0:07:43.753,000 --> 0:07:45,000
grandmothers are in every community.

145
0:07:46.171,000 --> 0:07:47,000
There are hundreds of them.

146
0:07:48.183,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And --

147
0:07:49.373,000 --> 0:07:5,000
(Laughter)

148
0:07:50.607,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And they don't leave their communities in search of greener pastures.

149
0:07:55.991,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Laughter)

150
0:07:57.495,000 --> 0:07:58,000
See, the only time they leave

151
0:07:59.039,000 --> 0:08:01,000
is when they go to a greener pasture called heaven.

152
0:08:01.632,000 --> 0:08:02,000
(Laughter)

153
0:08:02.78,000 --> 0:08:04,000
So I thought, how about training grandmothers

154
0:08:06.74,000 --> 0:08:08,000
in evidence-based talk therapy,

155
0:08:09.704,000 --> 0:08:12,000
which they can deliver on a bench?

156
0:08:13.283,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Empower them with the skills to listen,

157
0:08:16.966,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to show empathy,

158
0:08:19.154,000 --> 0:08:22,000
all of that rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy;

159
0:08:22.538,000 --> 0:08:26,000
empower them with the skills to provide behavior activation,

160
0:08:27.044,000 --> 0:08:28,000
activity scheduling;

161
0:08:28.9,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and support them using digital technology.

162
0:08:33.497,000 --> 0:08:35,000
You know, mobile phone technology.

163
0:08:35.614,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Pretty much everyone in Africa has a mobile phone today.

164
0:08:38.872,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So in 2006,

165
0:08:40.661,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I started my first group

166
0:08:44.016,000 --> 0:08:45,000
of grandmothers.

167
0:08:45.324,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Applause)

168
0:08:49.186,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Thank you.

169
0:08:50.36,000 --> 0:08:52,000
(Applause)

170
0:08:53.229,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Today, there are hundreds of grandmothers

171
0:08:56.588,000 --> 0:08:58,000
who are working in more than 70 communities.

172
0:09:00.844,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And in the last year alone,

173
0:09:03.371,000 --> 0:09:07,000
more than 30,000 people received treatment

174
0:09:08.32,000 --> 0:09:09,000
on the Friendship Bench

175
0:09:09.861,000 --> 0:09:12,000
from a grandmother in a community in Zimbabwe.

176
0:09:13.745,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Applause)

177
0:09:21.305,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And recently, we published this work that is done by these grandmothers

178
0:09:26.299,000 --> 0:09:29,000
in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

179
0:09:29.385,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And --

180
0:09:30.559,000 --> 0:09:31,000
(Applause)

181
0:09:32.241,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And our results show that six months after receiving treatment

182
0:09:38.942,000 --> 0:09:39,000
from a grandmother,

183
0:09:40.685,000 --> 0:09:41,000
people were still symptom-free:

184
0:09:42.851,000 --> 0:09:43,000
no depression,

185
0:09:44.836,000 --> 0:09:46,000
suicidal ideation completely reduced.

186
0:09:47.262,000 --> 0:09:5,000
In fact, our results -- this was a clinical trial --

187
0:09:50.968,000 --> 0:09:51,000
in fact, this clinical trial showed

188
0:09:52.973,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that grandmothers were more effective at treating depression

189
0:09:56.047,000 --> 0:09:57,000
than doctors and --

190
0:09:57.27,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Laughter)

191
0:09:58.832,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Applause)

192
0:10:06.466,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And so,

193
0:10:08.764,000 --> 0:10:11,000
we're now working towards expanding this program.

194
0:10:14.794,000 --> 0:10:2,000
There are more than 600 million people currently aged above 65 in the world.

195
0:10:21.813,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And by the year 2050,

196
0:10:23.708,000 --> 0:10:27,000
there will be 1.5 billion people aged 65 and above.

197
0:10:29.455,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Imagine if we could create a global network of grandmothers

198
0:10:35.497,000 --> 0:10:39,000
in every major city in the world,

199
0:10:39.883,000 --> 0:10:43,000
who are trained in evidence-based talk therapy,

200
0:10:44.018,000 --> 0:10:46,000
supported through digital platforms,

201
0:10:46.602,000 --> 0:10:47,000
networked.

202
0:10:48.553,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And they will make a difference in communities.

203
0:10:53.377,000 --> 0:10:55,000
They will reduce the treatment gap

204
0:10:55.626,000 --> 0:10:58,000
for mental, neurological and substance-use disorders.

205
0:11:00.283,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Finally,

206
0:11:01.587,000 --> 0:11:04,000
this is a file photograph of Grandmother Jack.

207
0:11:05.842,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So, Farai had six sessions on the bench with Grandmother Jack.

208
0:11:12.089,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Today, Farai is employed.

209
0:11:14.463,000 --> 0:11:17,000
She has her two children at school.

210
0:11:18.668,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And as for Grandmother Jack,

211
0:11:20.786,000 --> 0:11:26,000
one morning in February, we expected her to see her 257th client on the bench.

212
0:11:28.453,000 --> 0:11:29,000
She didn't show up.

213
0:11:31.076,000 --> 0:11:33,000
She had gone to a greener pasture called heaven.

214
0:11:34.46,000 --> 0:11:37,000
But I believe that Grandmother Jack,

215
0:11:37.741,000 --> 0:11:38,000
from up there,

216
0:11:39.719,000 --> 0:11:41,000
she's cheering on all the other grandmothers --

217
0:11:42.209,000 --> 0:11:46,000
the increasing number of grandmothers who are making a difference

218
0:11:46.826,000 --> 0:11:48,000
in the lives of thousands of people.

219
0:11:50.118,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And I'm sure she's in awe

220
0:11:52.651,000 --> 0:11:56,000
when she realizes that something that she helped to pioneer

221
0:11:57.524,000 --> 0:11:59,000
is now spreading to other countries,

222
0:12:00.152,000 --> 0:12:01,000
like Malawi,

223
0:12:01.398,000 --> 0:12:02,000
the island of Zanzibar

224
0:12:02.89,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and coming closer to home here in the Unites States

225
0:12:06.525,000 --> 0:12:07,000
in the city of New York.

226
0:12:09.039,000 --> 0:12:11,000
May her soul rest in peace.

227
0:12:12.508,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Thank you.

228
0:12:13.687,000 --> 0:12:15,000
(Applause)

229
0:12:16.504,000 --> 0:12:17,000
(Cheering)

230
0:12:18.513,000 --> 0:12:19,000
(Applause)

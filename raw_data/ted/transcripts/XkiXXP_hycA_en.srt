1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I am going to speak about corruption,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but I would like to juxtapose

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
two different things.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
One is the large global economy,

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the large globalized economy,

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and the other one is the small, and very limited,

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
capacity of our traditional governments

8
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and their international institutions

9
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
to govern, to shape, this economy.

10
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Because there is this asymmetry,

11
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
which creates, basically,

12
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
failing governance.

13
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Failing governance in many areas:

14
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment,

15
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in the area of exploitation of women and children,

16
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
in the area of climate change,

17
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in all the areas in which we really need

18
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
a capacity to reintroduce

19
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the primacy of politics

20
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
into the economy,

21
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
which is operating in a worldwide arena.

22
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And I think corruption,

23
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and the fight against corruption,

24
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and the impact of corruption,

25
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
is probably one of the most interesting ways

26
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to illustrate what I mean

27
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
with this failure of governance.

28
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Let me talk about my own experience.

29
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I used to work as the director

30
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
of the World Bank office in Nairobi

31
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
for East Africa.

32
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
At that time, I noticed

33
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that corruption, that grand corruption,

34
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that systematic corruption,

35
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
was undermining everything we were trying to do.

36
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And therefore, I began

37
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to not only try to protect

38
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
the work of the World Bank,

39
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
our own projects, our own programs

40
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
against corruption,

41
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
but in general, I thought, "We need a system

42
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to protect the people

43
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
in this part of the world

44
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
from the ravages of corruption."

45
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And as soon as I started this work,

46
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I received a memorandum from the World Bank,

47
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
from the legal department first,

48
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
in which they said, "You are not allowed to do this.

49
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries.

50
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
This is forbidden by the charter of the World Bank,

51
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
so I want you to stop your doings."

52
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
In the meantime, I was chairing

53
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
donor meetings, for instance,

54
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in which the various donors,

55
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and many of them like to be in Nairobi --

56
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
it is true, it is one of the

57
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
unsafest cities of the world,

58
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but they like to be there because the other cities

59
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
are even less comfortable.

60
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And in these donor meetings, I noticed

61
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that many of the worst projects --

62
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
which were put forward

63
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
by our clients, by the governments,

64
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
by promoters,

65
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
many of them representing

66
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
suppliers from the North --

67
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that the worst projects

68
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
were realized first.

69
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Let me give you an example:

70
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
a huge power project,

71
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
300 million dollars,

72
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to be built smack into

73
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
one of the most vulnerable, and one of the most beautiful,

74
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
areas of western Kenya.

75
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And we all noticed immediately

76
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that this project had no economic benefits:

77
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It had no clients, nobody would buy the electricity there,

78
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
nobody was interested in irrigation projects.

79
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
To the contrary, we knew that this project

80
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
would destroy the environment:

81
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It would destroy riparian forests,

82
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
which were the basis for

83
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the survival of nomadic groups,

84
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
the Samburu and the Turkana in this area.

85
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So everybody knew this is a, not a useless project,

86
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
this is an absolute damaging, a terrible project --

87
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country

88
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
for these hundreds of millions of dollars,

89
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and the siphoning off

90
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
of the scarce resources of the economy

91
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
from much more important activities

92
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
like schools, like hospitals and so on.

93
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And yet, we all rejected this project,

94
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
none of the donors was willing

95
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
to have their name connected with it,

96
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and it was the first project to be implemented.

97
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
The good projects, which we as a donor community

98
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
would take under our wings,

99
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
they took years, you know,

100
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
you had too many studies,

101
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and very often they didn't succeed.

102
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But these bad projects,

103
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
which were absolutely damaging -- for the economy

104
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
for many generations, for the environment,

105
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
for thousands of families who had to be resettled --

106
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
they were suddenly put together

107
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
by consortia of banks,

108
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
of supplier agencies,

109
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
of insurance agencies --

110
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
like in Germany, Hermes, and so on --

111
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and they came back very, very quickly,

112
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
driven by an unholy alliance

113
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
between the powerful elites

114
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
in the countries there

115
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and the suppliers from the North.

116
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Now, these suppliers

117
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
were our big companies.

118
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
They were the actors of this global market,

119
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
which I mentioned in the beginning.

120
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
They were the Siemenses of this world,

121
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
coming from France, from the UK, from Japan,

122
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
from Canada, from Germany,

123
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and they were systematically driven

124
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
by systematic, large-scale corruption.

125
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
We are not talking about

126
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
50,000 dollars here,

127
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
or 100,000 dollars there, or one million dollars there.

128
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
No, we are talking about 10 million, 20 million dollars

129
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
on the Swiss bank accounts,

130
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
on the bank accounts of Liechtenstein,

131
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
of the president's ministers,

132
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the high officials in the para-statal sectors.

133
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
This was the reality which I saw,

134
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and not only one project like that:

135
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I saw, I would say,

136
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
over the years I worked in Africa,

137
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I saw hundreds of projects like this.

138
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And so, I became convinced

139
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that it is this systematic corruption

140
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
which is perverting economic policy-making in these countries,

141
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
which is the main reason

142
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
for the misery, for the poverty,

143
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
for the conflicts, for the violence,

144
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
for the desperation

145
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
in many of these countries.

146
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
That we have today

147
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line,

148
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that we have more than a billion people

149
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
without proper drinking water in the world,

150
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
twice that number,

151
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
more than two billion people

152
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
without sanitation and so on,

153
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and the consequent illnesses

154
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
of mothers and children,

155
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
still, child mortality of more than

156
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
10 million people every year,

157
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
children dying before they are five years old:

158
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
The cause of this is, to a large extent,

159
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
grand corruption.

160
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Now, why did the World Bank

161
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
not let me do this work?

162
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I found out afterwards,

163
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
after I left, under a big fight, the World Bank.

164
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
The reason was that the members of the World Bank

165
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
thought that foreign bribery was okay,

166
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
including Germany.

167
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
In Germany, foreign bribery was allowed.

168
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It was even tax-deductible.

169
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
No wonder that most of the most important

170
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
international operators in Germany,

171
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
but also in France and the UK

172
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and Scandinavia, everywhere, systematically bribed.

173
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Not all of them, but most of them.

174
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And this is the phenomenon

175
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
which I call failing governance,

176
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
because when I then came to Germany

177
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and started this little NGO

178
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
here in Berlin, at the Villa Borsig,

179
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
we were told, "You cannot stop

180
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
our German exporters from bribing,

181
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
because we will lose our contracts.

182
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
We will lose to the French,

183
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
we will lose to the Swedes, we'll lose to the Japanese."

184
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And therefore, there was a indeed a prisoner's dilemma,

185
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
which made it very difficult

186
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
for an individual company,

187
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
an individual exporting country

188
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to say, "We are not going to

189
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
continue this deadly, disastrous

190
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
habit of large companies to bribe."

191
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So this is what I mean

192
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
with a failing governance structure,

193
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
because even the powerful government,

194
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
which we have in Germany, comparatively,

195
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
was not able to say,

196
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
"We will not allow our companies to bribe abroad."

197
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
They needed help,

198
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and the large companies themselves

199
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
have this dilemma.

200
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Many of them didn't want to bribe.

201
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Many of the German companies, for instance,

202
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
believe that they are really

203
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
producing a high-quality product

204
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
at a good price, so they are very competitive.

205
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
They are not as good at bribing

206
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
as many of their international competitors are,

207
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
but they were not allowed

208
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to show their strengths,

209
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
because the world was eaten up

210
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
by grand corruption.

211
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And this is why I'm telling you this:

212
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Civil society rose to the occasion.

213
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
We had this small NGO,

214
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Transparency International.

215
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
They began to think of

216
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
an escape route from this prisoner's dilemma,

217
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and we developed concepts

218
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
of collective action,

219
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
basically trying to bring various competitors

220
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
together around the table,

221
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
explaining to all of them

222
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
how much it would be in their interests

223
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
if they simultaneously would stop bribing,

224
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and to make a long story short,

225
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
we managed to eventually

226
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
get Germany to sign

227
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
together with the other OECD countries

228
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and a few other exporters.

229
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
In 1997, a convention,

230
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
under the auspices of the OECD,

231
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
which obliged everybody

232
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
to change their laws

233
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and criminalize foreign bribery.

234
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Applause)

235
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Well, thank you. I mean, it's interesting,

236
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
in doing this,

237
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
we had to sit together with the companies.

238
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
We had here in Berlin, at the Aspen Institute on the Wannsee,

239
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
we had sessions with about

240
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
20 captains of industry,

241
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and we discussed with them

242
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
what to do about international bribery.

243
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
In the first session -- we had three sessions

244
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
over the course of two years.

245
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And President von Weizsäcker, by the way,

246
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
chaired one of the sessions, the first one,

247
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
to take the fear away

248
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
from the entrepreneurs,

249
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
who were not used to deal

250
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
with non-governmental organizations.

251
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And in the first session, they all said,

252
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
"This is not bribery, what we are doing." This is customary there.

253
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
This is what these other cultures demand.

254
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
They even applaud it.

255
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
In fact, [unclear]

256
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
still says this today.

257
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And so there are still a lot of people

258
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing.

259
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But in the second session,

260
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
they admitted already that they would never do this,

261
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
what they are doing in these other countries,

262
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
here in Germany, or in the U.K., and so on.

263
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Cabinet ministers would admit this.

264
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And in the final session, at the Aspen Institute,

265
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
we had them all sign an open letter

266
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
to the Kohl government, at the time,

267
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
requesting that they

268
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
participate in the OECD convention.

269
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And this is, in my opinion,

270
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
an example of soft power,

271
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
because we were able to convince them

272
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that they had to go with us.

273
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
We had a longer-term time perspective.

274
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
We had a broader,

275
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
geographically much wider,

276
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
constituency we were trying to defend.

277
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And that's why the law has changed.

278
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
That's why Siemens is now in the trouble they are in

279
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and that's why MIN is in the trouble they are in.

280
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
In some other countries, the OECD convention

281
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
is not yet properly enforced.

282
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And, again, civil societies

283
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
breathing down the neck of the establishment.

284
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
In London, for instance,

285
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
where the BAE got away

286
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
with a huge corruption case,

287
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
which the Serious Fraud Office tried to prosecute,

288
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
100 million British pounds,

289
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
every year for ten years,

290
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
to one particular official of one particular friendly country,

291
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
who then bought for

292
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
44 billion pounds of military equipment.

293
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
This case, they are not prosecuting in the UK.

294
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Why? Because they consider this

295
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
as contrary to the security interest

296
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
of the people of Great Britain.

297
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Civil society is pushing, civil society

298
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
is trying to get a solution to this problem,

299
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
also in the U.K.,

300
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and also in Japan, which is not properly enforcing,

301
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and so on.

302
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
In Germany, we are pushing

303
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
the ratification of the UN convention,

304
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
which is a subsequent convention.

305
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
We are, Germany, is not ratifying.

306
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Why? Because it would make it necessary

307
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
to criminalize the corruption

308
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
of deputies.

309
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
In Germany, we have a system where

310
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant,

311
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
but you are allowed to bribe a deputy.

312
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
This is, under German law, allowed,

313
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and the members of our parliament don't want to change this,

314
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and this is why they can't sign

315
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
the U.N. convention against foreign bribery --

316
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
one of they very, very few countries

317
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
which is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world,

318
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
but not able to ratify the convention,

319
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
which we managed to get on the books

320
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
with about 160 countries all over the world.

321
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I see my time is ticking.

322
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Let me just try to

323
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
draw some conclusions from what has happened.

324
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
I believe that what we managed to achieve

325
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
in fighting corruption,

326
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
one can also achieve

327
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
in other areas of failing governance.

328
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
By now, the United Nations

329
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
is totally on our side.

330
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
The World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus; under Wolfensohn,

331
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
they became, I would say, the strongest

332
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
anti-corruption agency in the world.

333
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Most of the large companies

334
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
are now totally convinced

335
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
that they have to put in place

336
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
very strong policies

337
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
against bribery and so on.

338
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And this is possible because civil society

339
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
joined the companies

340
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and joined the government

341
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
in the analysis of the problem,

342
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
in the development of remedies,

343
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
in the implementation of reforms,

344
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and then later, in the monitoring of reforms.

345
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Of course, if civil society organizations

346
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
want to play that role,

347
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
they have to grow into this responsibility.

348
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Not all civil society organizations are good.

349
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
The Ku Klux Klan is an NGO.

350
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
So, we must be aware

351
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
that civil society

352
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
has to shape up itself.

353
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
They have to have a much more

354
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
transparent financial governance.

355
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
They have to have a much more participatory governance

356
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
in many civil society organizations.

357
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
We also need much more competence of civil society leaders.

358
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
This is why we have set up the governance school

359
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin,

360
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
because we believe most of our educational

361
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and research institutions in Germany

362
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and continental Europe in general,

363
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
do not focus enough, yet,

364
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
on empowering civil society

365
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and training the leadership of civil society.

366
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
But what I'm saying from my very practical experience:

367
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
If civil society does it right

368
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and joins the other actors --

369
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
in particular, governments,

370
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
governments and their international institutions,

371
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
but also large international actors,

372
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
in particular those which have committed themselves

373
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
to corporate social responsibility --

374
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
then in this magical triangle

375
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
between civil society,

376
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
government and private sector,

377
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
there is a tremendous chance

378
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
for all of us to create a better world.

379
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Thank you.

380
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
(Applause)

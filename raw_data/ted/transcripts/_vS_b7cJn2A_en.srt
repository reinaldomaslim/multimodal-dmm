0:00:12.14,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Some years ago,

2
0:00:13.731,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I stumbled across a simple design exercise

3
0:00:17.175,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that helps people understand and solve complex problems,

4
0:00:20.78,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and like many of these design exercises, it kind of seems trivial at first,

5
0:00:24.867,000 --> 0:00:25,000
but under deep inspection,

6
0:00:26.611,000 --> 0:00:28,000
it turns out that it reveals unexpected truths

7
0:00:29.331,000 --> 0:00:32,000
about the way that we collaborate and make sense of things.

8
0:00:32.662,000 --> 0:00:33,000
The exercise has three parts

9
0:00:34.264,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and begins with something that we all know how to do,

10
0:00:36.749,000 --> 0:00:38,000
which is how to make toast.

11
0:00:39.489,000 --> 0:00:42,000
It begins with a clean sheet of paper, a felt marker,

12
0:00:42.809,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and without using any words, you begin to draw how to make toast.

13
0:00:46.94,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And most people draw something like this.

14
0:00:49.118,000 --> 0:00:52,000
They draw a loaf of bread, which is sliced, then put into a toaster.

15
0:00:52.498,000 --> 0:00:54,000
The toast is then deposited for some time.

16
0:00:54.744,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It pops up, and then voila! After two minutes, toast and happiness.

17
0:01:01.045,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Now, over the years, I've collected many hundreds of drawings of these toasts,

18
0:01:05.643,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and some of them are very good,

19
0:01:07.403,000 --> 0:01:1,000
because they really illustrate the toast-making process quite clearly.

20
0:01:10.869,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And then there are some that are, well, not so good.

21
0:01:14.166,000 --> 0:01:19,000
They really suck, actually, because you don't know what they're trying to say.

22
0:01:19.344,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Under close inspection,

23
0:01:21.271,000 --> 0:01:24,000
some reveal some aspects of toast-making while hiding others.

24
0:01:24.754,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So there's some that are all about the toast,

25
0:01:27.424,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and all about the transformation of toast.

26
0:01:30.164,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And there's others that are all about the toaster,

27
0:01:32.764,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and the engineers love to draw the mechanics of this.

28
0:01:36.094,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:37.504,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And then there are others that are about people.

30
0:01:39.875,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It's about visualizing the experience that people have.

31
0:01:43.723,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And then there are others that are about the supply chain of making toast

32
0:01:47.236,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that goes all the way back to the store.

33
0:01:49.226,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It goes through the supply chain networks of teleportation

34
0:01:52.663,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and all the way back to the field and wheat,

35
0:01:55.89,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and one all actually goes all the way back to the Big Bang.

36
0:01:58.7,000 --> 0:02:,000
So it's crazy stuff.

37
0:02:00.904,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But I think it's obvious

38
0:02:02.757,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that even though these drawings are really wildly different,

39
0:02:06.263,000 --> 0:02:09,000
they share a common quality, and I'm wondering if you can see it.

40
0:02:09.366,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Do you see it? What's common about these?

41
0:02:11.743,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Most drawings have nodes and links.

42
0:02:15.118,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So nodes represent the tangible objects like the toaster and people,

43
0:02:20.468,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and links represent the connections between the nodes.

44
0:02:23.974,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And it's the combination of links and nodes

45
0:02:26.807,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that produces a full systems model,

46
0:02:28.92,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and it makes our private mental models visible

47
0:02:31.845,000 --> 0:02:34,000
about how we think something works.

48
0:02:34.878,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So that's the value of these things.

49
0:02:36.709,000 --> 0:02:38,000
What's interesting about these systems models

50
0:02:38.817,000 --> 0:02:4,000
is how they reveal our various points of view.

51
0:02:41.002,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So for example, Americans make toast with a toaster.

52
0:02:44.623,000 --> 0:02:45,000
That seems obvious.

53
0:02:46.144,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Whereas many Europeans make toast with a frying pan, of course,

54
0:02:50.114,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and many students make toast with a fire.

55
0:02:54.391,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I don't really understand this. A lot of MBA students do this.

56
0:02:57.61,000 --> 0:03:,000
So you can measure the complexity by counting the number of nodes,

57
0:03:01.375,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and the average illustration has between four and eight nodes.

58
0:03:05.297,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Less than that, the drawing seems trivial,

59
0:03:08.292,000 --> 0:03:1,000
but it's quick to understand,

60
0:03:10.545,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and more than 13, the drawing produces a feeling of map shock.

61
0:03:15.618,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It's too complex.

62
0:03:17.121,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So the sweet spot is between 5 and 13.

63
0:03:19.664,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So if you want to communicate something visually,

64
0:03:22.294,000 --> 0:03:25,000
have between five and 13 nodes in your diagram.

65
0:03:26.021,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So though we may not be skilled at drawing,

66
0:03:28.725,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the point is that we intuitively know how to break down complex things

67
0:03:32.856,000 --> 0:03:35,000
into simple things and then bring them back together again.

68
0:03:36.116,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So this brings us to our second part of the exercise,

69
0:03:39.337,000 --> 0:03:4,000
which is how to make toast,

70
0:03:40.913,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but now with sticky notes or with cards.

71
0:03:43.713,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So what happens then?

72
0:03:46.041,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Well, with cards, most people tend to draw clear, more detailed,

73
0:03:49.462,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and more logical nodes.

74
0:03:51.74,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You can see the step by step analysis that takes place,

75
0:03:55.317,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and as they build up their model, they move their nodes around,

76
0:03:58.549,000 --> 0:04:,000
rearranging them like Lego blocks.

77
0:04:01.129,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Now, though this might seem trivial, it's actually really important.

78
0:04:05.184,000 --> 0:04:09,000
This rapid iteration of expressing and then reflecting and analyzing

79
0:04:09.912,000 --> 0:04:12,000
is really the only way in which we get clarity.

80
0:04:13.263,000 --> 0:04:15,000
It's the essence of the design process.

81
0:04:15.911,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And systems theorists do tell us

82
0:04:17.62,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that the ease with which we can change a representation

83
0:04:21.182,000 --> 0:04:24,000
correlates to our willingness to improve the model.

84
0:04:25.447,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So sticky note systems are not only more fluid,

85
0:04:29.239,000 --> 0:04:33,000
they generally produce way more nodes than static drawings.

86
0:04:33.279,000 --> 0:04:34,000
The drawings are much richer.

87
0:04:35.01,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And this brings us to our third part of the exercise,

88
0:04:37.575,000 --> 0:04:4,000
which is to draw how to make toast, but this time in a group.

89
0:04:41.509,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So what happens then?

90
0:04:43.271,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Well, here's what happens.

91
0:04:44.883,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It starts out messy, and then it gets really messy,

92
0:04:48.5,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and then it gets messier,

93
0:04:50.125,000 --> 0:04:51,000
but as people refine the models,

94
0:04:52.052,000 --> 0:04:54,000
the best nodes become more prominent,

95
0:04:54.583,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and with each iteration, the model becomes clearer

96
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
because people build on top of each other's ideas.

97
0:05:00.434,000 --> 0:05:03,000
What emerges is a unified systems model

98
0:05:03.917,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that integrates the diversity of everyone's individual points of view,

99
0:05:08.057,000 --> 0:05:09,000
so that's a really different outcome

100
0:05:09.977,000 --> 0:05:11,000
from what usually happens in meetings, isn't it?

101
0:05:12.648,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So these drawings can contain 20 or more nodes,

102
0:05:15.62,000 --> 0:05:17,000
but participants don't feel map shock

103
0:05:17.849,000 --> 0:05:21,000
because they participate in the building of their models themselves.

104
0:05:22.074,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Now, what's also really interesting, that the groups spontaneously mix

105
0:05:25.395,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and add additional layers of organization to it.

106
0:05:28.854,000 --> 0:05:3,000
To deal with contradictions, for example,

107
0:05:30.864,000 --> 0:05:32,000
they add branching patterns and parallel patterns.

108
0:05:33.684,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Oh, and by the way, if they do it in complete silence,

109
0:05:36.907,000 --> 0:05:38,000
they do it much better and much more quickly.

110
0:05:39.663,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Really interesting -- talking gets in the way.

111
0:05:42.205,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So here's some key lessons that can emerge from this.

112
0:05:45.897,000 --> 0:05:47,000
First, drawing helps us understand the situations

113
0:05:48.476,000 --> 0:05:51,000
as systems with nodes and their relationships.

114
0:05:51.748,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Movable cards produce better systems models,

115
0:05:55.388,000 --> 0:05:57,000
because we iterate much more fluidly.

116
0:05:58.118,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And then the group notes produce the most comprehensive models

117
0:06:01.332,000 --> 0:06:04,000
because we synthesize several points of view.

118
0:06:04.689,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So that's interesting.

119
0:06:06.275,000 --> 0:06:09,000
When people work together under the right circumstances,

120
0:06:09.581,000 --> 0:06:12,000
group models are much better than individual models.

121
0:06:12.692,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So this approach works really great for drawing how to make toast,

122
0:06:17.639,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but what if you wanted to draw something more relevant or pressing,

123
0:06:21.528,000 --> 0:06:26,000
like your organizational vision, or customer experience,

124
0:06:26.636,000 --> 0:06:28,000
or long-term sustainability?

125
0:06:28.94,000 --> 0:06:31,000
There's a visual revolution that's taking place

126
0:06:32.446,000 --> 0:06:35,000
as more organizations are addressing their wicked problems

127
0:06:35.859,000 --> 0:06:37,000
by collaboratively drawing them out.

128
0:06:38.645,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And I'm convinced that those who see their world as movable nodes and links

129
0:06:43.267,000 --> 0:06:45,000
really have an edge.

130
0:06:45.391,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And the practice is really pretty simple.

131
0:06:47.469,000 --> 0:06:49,000
You start with a question, you collect the nodes,

132
0:06:50.371,000 --> 0:06:53,000
you refine the nodes, you do it over again,

133
0:06:53.459,000 --> 0:06:58,000
you refine and refine and refine, and the patterns emerge,

134
0:06:58.768,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and the group gets clarity and you answer the question.

135
0:07:05.07,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So this simple act of visualizing and doing over and over again

136
0:07:11.112,000 --> 0:07:13,000
produces some really remarkable outcomes.

137
0:07:13.694,000 --> 0:07:14,000
What's really important to know

138
0:07:15.581,000 --> 0:07:18,000
is that it's the conversations that are the important aspects,

139
0:07:19.271,000 --> 0:07:21,000
not just the models themselves.

140
0:07:21.596,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And these visual frames of reference

141
0:07:23.384,000 --> 0:07:27,000
can grow to several hundreds or even thousands of nodes.

142
0:07:27.982,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So, one example is from an organization called Rodale.

143
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Big publishing company.

144
0:07:32.486,000 --> 0:07:34,000
They lost a bunch of money one year,

145
0:07:34.622,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and their executive team for three days visualized their entire practice.

146
0:07:38.964,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And what's interesting is that after visualizing the entire business,

147
0:07:44.886,000 --> 0:07:45,000
systems upon systems,

148
0:07:46.65,000 --> 0:07:49,000
they reclaimed 50 million dollars of revenue,

149
0:07:49.716,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and they also moved from a D rating to an A rating from their customers.

150
0:07:54.734,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Why? Because there's alignment from the executive team.

151
0:07:58.329,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So I'm now on a mission to help organizations

152
0:08:01.742,000 --> 0:08:05,000
solve their wicked problems by using collaborative visualization,

153
0:08:06.456,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and on a site that I've produced called drawtoast.com,

154
0:08:09.474,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I've collected a bunch of best practices.

155
0:08:12.678,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and so you can learn how to run a workshop here,

156
0:08:15.441,000 --> 0:08:17,000
you can learn more about the visual language

157
0:08:17.584,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and the structure of links and nodes that you can apply to general problem-solving,

158
0:08:22.5,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and download examples of various templates

159
0:08:25.705,000 --> 0:08:3,000
for unpacking the thorny problems that we all face in our organizations.

160
0:08:30.998,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So the seemingly trivial design exercise of drawing toast

161
0:08:34.62,000 --> 0:08:38,000
helps us get clear, engaged and aligned.

162
0:08:38.661,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So next time you're confronted with an interesting challenge,

163
0:08:41.609,000 --> 0:08:43,000
remember what design has to teach us.

164
0:08:43.943,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Make your ideas visible, tangible, and consequential.

165
0:08:47.774,000 --> 0:08:5,000
It's simple, it's fun, it's powerful,

166
0:08:50.932,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and I believe it's an idea worth celebrating.

167
0:08:54.082,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Thank you.

168
0:08:55.902,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.865,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Let's talk about thrift.

2
0:00:15.206,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Thrift is a concept where you reduce, reuse and recycle,

3
0:00:19.768,000 --> 0:00:22,000
but yet with an economic aspect I think has a real potential for change.

4
0:00:25.209,000 --> 0:00:27,000
My grandmother, she knew about thrift.

5
0:00:27.367,000 --> 0:00:28,000
This is her string jar.

6
0:00:29.082,000 --> 0:00:3,000
She never bought any string.

7
0:00:30.502,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Basically, she would collect string.

8
0:00:32.242,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It would come from the butcher's, it would come from presents.

9
0:00:35.187,000 --> 0:00:37,000
She would put it in the jar and then use it when it was needed.

10
0:00:38.206,000 --> 0:00:4,000
When it was finished, whether it was tying up the roses

11
0:00:40.804,000 --> 0:00:41,000
or a part of my bike,

12
0:00:41.979,000 --> 0:00:43,000
once finished with that, it'd go back into the jar.

13
0:00:44.386,000 --> 0:00:46,000
This is a perfect idea of thrift; you use what you need,

14
0:00:47.041,000 --> 0:00:49,000
you don't actually purchase anything, so you save money.

15
0:00:50.609,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Kids also inherently know this idea.

16
0:00:52.7,000 --> 0:00:54,000
When you want to throw out a cardboard box,

17
0:00:54.731,000 --> 0:00:57,000
the average kid will say, "Don't! I want to use it for a robot head

18
0:00:57.924,000 --> 0:00:59,000
or for a canoe to paddle down a river."

19
0:01:00.188,000 --> 0:01:03,000
They understand the value of the second life of products.

20
0:01:04.53,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So, I think thrift is a perfect counterpoint

21
0:01:07.807,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to the current age which we live in.

22
0:01:09.99,000 --> 0:01:11,000
All of our current products are replaceable.

23
0:01:12.238,000 --> 0:01:14,000
When we get that bright, new, shiny toy,

24
0:01:14.616,000 --> 0:01:16,000
it's because, basically, we got rid of the old one.

25
0:01:17.807,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The idea of that is, of course, it's great in the moment,

26
0:01:21.813,000 --> 0:01:23,000
but the challenge is, as we keep doing this,

27
0:01:24.751,000 --> 0:01:25,000
we're going to cause a problem.

28
0:01:26.481,000 --> 0:01:29,000
That problem is that there is really no way.

29
0:01:29.815,000 --> 0:01:32,000
When you throw something away, it typically goes into a landfill.

30
0:01:33.903,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now, a landfill is basically something which is not going to go away,

31
0:01:37.506,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and it's increasing.

32
0:01:38.696,000 --> 0:01:42,000
At the moment, we have about 1.3 billion tons of material every year

33
0:01:43.163,000 --> 0:01:44,000
going into landfills.

34
0:01:44.64,000 --> 0:01:46,000
By 2100, it's going to be about four billion tons.

35
0:01:48.109,000 --> 0:01:5,000
See, instead, I'd prefer if we started thrifting.

36
0:01:51.122,000 --> 0:01:56,000
What that means is, we consider materials when they go into products

37
0:01:56.258,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and also when they get used,

38
0:01:57.673,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and, at the end of their life: When can they be used again?

39
0:02:00.481,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It's the idea of completely changing the way we think about waste,

40
0:02:03.618,000 --> 0:02:04,000
so waste is no longer a dirty word --

41
0:02:05.415,000 --> 0:02:07,000
we almost remove the word "waste" completely.

42
0:02:07.574,000 --> 0:02:08,000
All we're looking to is resources.

43
0:02:09.497,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Resource goes into a product

44
0:02:10.855,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and then can basically go into another product.

45
0:02:15.228,000 --> 0:02:16,000
We used to be good at thrifting.

46
0:02:17.236,000 --> 0:02:19,000
My grandmother, again, used to use old seed packets

47
0:02:19.966,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to paper the bathroom walls.

48
0:02:21.393,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I think, though, there are companies out there who understand this value

49
0:02:24.854,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and are promoting it.

50
0:02:26.466,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And a lot of the technologies that have been developed for the smart age

51
0:02:29.903,000 --> 0:02:32,000
can also be adapted to reduce, reuse and also thrift more proficiently.

52
0:02:34.741,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And as a materials scientist,

53
0:02:36.347,000 --> 0:02:38,000
what I've been tracking over the last couple of decades

54
0:02:38.966,000 --> 0:02:4,000
is how companies are getting smart at thrifting,

55
0:02:41.269,000 --> 0:02:43,000
how they're able to understand this concept

56
0:02:43.324,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and profit from it.

57
0:02:45.341,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I'm going to give you two examples.

58
0:02:47.091,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The first one, a good one; the second one, not so good.

59
0:02:49.735,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The first is the automotive industry.

60
0:02:51.821,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Not always known as the most innovative or creative of industries,

61
0:02:54.962,000 --> 0:02:57,000
but it turns out, they're really, really good at recycling their products.

62
0:02:58.839,000 --> 0:03:,000
Ninety-five percent of every single car that goes on the road

63
0:03:01.751,000 --> 0:03:02,000
gets recycled here.

64
0:03:03.085,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And of that car, about 75 percent of the entire car

65
0:03:06.442,000 --> 0:03:07,000
actually gets used again.

66
0:03:08.584,000 --> 0:03:1,000
That includes, of course, the old steel and aluminum

67
0:03:11.178,000 --> 0:03:14,000
but then also the plastics from the fender and the interiors,

68
0:03:15.015,000 --> 0:03:16,000
glass from the windows and the windshield

69
0:03:17.03,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and also the tires.

70
0:03:18.522,000 --> 0:03:21,000
There's a mature and successful industry that deals with these old cars

71
0:03:22.538,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and basically recycles them and puts them back into use

72
0:03:25.585,000 --> 0:03:27,000
as new cars or other new products.

73
0:03:28.165,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Even as we move towards battery-powered cars,

74
0:03:31.496,000 --> 0:03:34,000
there are companies that claim they can recycle up to 90 percent

75
0:03:34.577,000 --> 0:03:37,000
of the 11 million tons of batteries that are going to be with us in 2020.

76
0:03:39.117,000 --> 0:03:4,000
That, I think, is not perfect,

77
0:03:40.626,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but it's certainly good, and it's getting better.

78
0:03:43.403,000 --> 0:03:46,000
The industry that's not doing so well is the architecture industry.

79
0:03:48.045,000 --> 0:03:5,000
One of the challenges with architecture has always been

80
0:03:50.672,000 --> 0:03:52,000
when we build up, we don't think about taking down.

81
0:03:53.101,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We don't dismantle, we don't disassemble, we demolish.

82
0:03:56.49,000 --> 0:03:57,000
That's a challenge,

83
0:03:57.673,000 --> 0:04:,000
because it ends up that about a third of all landfill waste in the US

84
0:04:00.977,000 --> 0:04:01,000
is architecture.

85
0:04:02.911,000 --> 0:04:03,000
We need to think differently about this.

86
0:04:04.919,000 --> 0:04:07,000
There are programs that can actually reduce some of this material.

87
0:04:08.077,000 --> 0:04:09,000
A good example is this.

88
0:04:09.347,000 --> 0:04:12,000
These are actually bricks that are made from old demolition waste,

89
0:04:12.712,000 --> 0:04:15,000
which includes the glass, the rubble, the concrete.

90
0:04:16.125,000 --> 0:04:18,000
You put up a grinder, put it all together, heat it up

91
0:04:18.731,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and make these bricks we can basically build more buildings from.

92
0:04:21.834,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But it's only a fraction of what we need.

93
0:04:23.829,000 --> 0:04:27,000
My hope is that with big data and geotagging,

94
0:04:28.434,000 --> 0:04:29,000
we can actually change that,

95
0:04:29.8,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and be more thrifty when it comes to buildings.

96
0:04:32.077,000 --> 0:04:35,000
If there's a building down the block which is being demolished,

97
0:04:35.236,000 --> 0:04:36,000
are there materials there

98
0:04:36.688,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that the new building being built here can use?

99
0:04:39.482,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Can we use that, the ability to understand

100
0:04:42.189,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that all the materials available in that building are still usable?

101
0:04:45.396,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Can we then basically put them into a new building,

102
0:04:48.752,000 --> 0:04:5,000
without actually losing any value in the process?

103
0:04:53.068,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So now let's think about other industries.

104
0:04:55.188,000 --> 0:04:57,000
What are other industries doing to create thrift?

105
0:04:57.739,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Well, it turns out that there are plenty of industries

106
0:05:00.325,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that are also thinking about their own waste

107
0:05:02.41,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and what we can do with it.

108
0:05:03.725,000 --> 0:05:05,000
A simple example is the waste that they basically belch out

109
0:05:06.633,000 --> 0:05:07,000
as part of industrial processes.

110
0:05:08.226,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Most metal smelters give off an awful lot of carbon dioxide.

111
0:05:11.704,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Turns out, there's a company called Land Detector

112
0:05:14.252,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that's actually working in China and also soon in South Africa,

113
0:05:17.279,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that's able to take that waste gas --

114
0:05:20.202,000 --> 0:05:23,000
about 700,000 tons per smelter --

115
0:05:24.101,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and then turn it into about 400,000 tons of ethanol,

116
0:05:27.072,000 --> 0:05:31,000
which is equivalent to basically powering 250,000, or quarter of a million, cars

117
0:05:31.639,000 --> 0:05:32,000
for a year.

118
0:05:32.814,000 --> 0:05:33,000
That's a very effective use of waste.

119
0:05:36.125,000 --> 0:05:38,000
How about products more close to home?

120
0:05:38.613,000 --> 0:05:39,000
This is a simple solution.

121
0:05:40.3,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And it, again, takes the idea of reducing, reusing,

122
0:05:43.188,000 --> 0:05:45,000
but then also with economic advantage.

123
0:05:45.355,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So it's a simple process of changing from a cut and sew,

124
0:05:48.284,000 --> 0:05:51,000
where typically between 20 and 30 materials are used

125
0:05:51.459,000 --> 0:05:54,000
which are cut from a large cloth and then sewn together or even sometimes glued,

126
0:05:55.442,000 --> 0:05:57,000
they changed it and said that they just knitted the shoe.

127
0:05:58.142,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The advantage with this is not just a simplification of the process,

128
0:06:01.427,000 --> 0:06:04,000
it's also, "I've got one material. I have zero waste,"

129
0:06:04.618,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and then also, "I'm able to potentially recycle that at the end of its life."

130
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Digital manufacturing is also allowing us to do this more effectively.

131
0:06:13.593,000 --> 0:06:16,000
In this case, it's actually creating the theoretical limit of strength

132
0:06:16.928,000 --> 0:06:17,000
for a material:

133
0:06:18.104,000 --> 0:06:2,000
you cannot get any stronger for the amount of material

134
0:06:20.71,000 --> 0:06:21,000
than this shape.

135
0:06:22.624,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So it's a basic simple block,

136
0:06:24.268,000 --> 0:06:27,000
but the idea is, I can extrapolate this, I can make it into large formats,

137
0:06:27.875,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I can make it into buildings, bridges,

138
0:06:29.893,000 --> 0:06:3,000
but also airplane wings and shoes.

139
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
The idea here is, I'm minimizing the amount of material.

140
0:06:36.101,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Here's a good example from architecture.

141
0:06:38.895,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Typically, these sorts of metal nodes are used to hold up large tent structures.

142
0:06:43.054,000 --> 0:06:45,000
In this case, it in was in the Hague, along a shopping center.

143
0:06:46.015,000 --> 0:06:48,000
They used 1600 of the materials on the left.

144
0:06:48.982,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The difference is, by using the solution on the right,

145
0:06:51.554,000 --> 0:06:53,000
they cut down the number of steps from seven to one,

146
0:06:54.395,000 --> 0:06:56,000
because the one on the left is currently welded,

147
0:06:56.696,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the one on the right is simply just printed.

148
0:06:58.77,000 --> 0:07:,000
And it was able to reduce waste to zero,

149
0:07:00.985,000 --> 0:07:01,000
cost less money

150
0:07:02.572,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and also, because it's made out of steel,

151
0:07:04.762,000 --> 0:07:06,000
can be eventually recycled at the end of its life.

152
0:07:09.824,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Nature also is very effective at thrift.

153
0:07:12.521,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Think about it: nature has zero waste.

154
0:07:14.752,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Everything is useful for another process.

155
0:07:17.569,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So, in this case, nanocellulose,

156
0:07:19.688,000 --> 0:07:22,000
which is basically one of the very fine building blocks of cellulose,

157
0:07:22.967,000 --> 0:07:25,000
which is one of the materials that makes trees strong,

158
0:07:27.053,000 --> 0:07:3,000
you can isolate it, and it works very much like carbon fiber.

159
0:07:30.363,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So, take that from a tree, form it into fibers,

160
0:07:33.165,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and then those fibers can strengthen things,

161
0:07:35.38,000 --> 0:07:37,000
such as airplanes, buildings, cars.

162
0:07:38.291,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The advantage of this, though, is it's not just bioderived,

163
0:07:41.119,000 --> 0:07:42,000
comes from a renewable resource,

164
0:07:42.769,000 --> 0:07:43,000
but also that it is transparent,

165
0:07:44.633,000 --> 0:07:47,000
so it can be used in consumer electronics, as well as food packaging.

166
0:07:48.363,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Not bad for something that basically comes from the backyard.

167
0:07:51.43,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Another one from the biosource is synthetic spider silk.

168
0:07:54.921,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Now, it's very hard to actually create spider silk naturally.

169
0:07:58.538,000 --> 0:07:59,000
You can basically get it from spiders,

170
0:08:00.382,000 --> 0:08:03,000
but in large numbers, they tend to kill each other, eat each other,

171
0:08:03.563,000 --> 0:08:04,000
so you've got a problem with creating it,

172
0:08:05.548,000 --> 0:08:06,000
in the same way you do with regular silk.

173
0:08:07.528,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So what you can do is instead take the DNA from the spider,

174
0:08:10.348,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and put it into various different things.

175
0:08:12.357,000 --> 0:08:14,000
You can put it into bacteria, you can put it into yeast,

176
0:08:15.07,000 --> 0:08:16,000
you can put it into milk.

177
0:08:16.3,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And what you can do then is,

178
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
the milk or the bacteria produce in much larger volumes

179
0:08:21.212,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and then from that, spin a yarn and then create a fabric or a rope.

180
0:08:25.677,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Again, bioderived, has incredible strength -- about the same as Kevlar --

181
0:08:29.264,000 --> 0:08:32,000
so they're using it in things like bulletproof vests and helmets

182
0:08:32.368,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and outdoor jackets.

183
0:08:33.545,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It has a great performance.

184
0:08:34.872,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But again, it's bioderived, and at the end of its life,

185
0:08:37.493,000 --> 0:08:39,000
it potentially can go back into the soil and get composted

186
0:08:40.256,000 --> 0:08:42,000
to again be potentially used as a new material.

187
0:08:44.201,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I'd like to leave you with one last form which is biobased,

188
0:08:47.003,000 --> 0:08:49,000
but this, I think, is like the ultimate thrift.

189
0:08:49.241,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Think about the poster child for conspicuous consumption.

190
0:08:51.979,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It's the water bottle.

191
0:08:53.712,000 --> 0:08:55,000
We have too many of them, they're basically going everywhere,

192
0:08:56.619,000 --> 0:08:57,000
they're a problem in the ocean.

193
0:08:58.481,000 --> 0:08:59,000
What do we do with them?

194
0:09:00.038,000 --> 0:09:02,000
This process is able not just to recycle them,

195
0:09:02.641,000 --> 0:09:03,000
but to recycle them infinitely.

196
0:09:04.163,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Why is that interesting?

197
0:09:05.444,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Because when we think about reusing and recycling,

198
0:09:08.538,000 --> 0:09:13,000
metals, glass, things like that, can be recycled as many times as you like.

199
0:09:13.704,000 --> 0:09:14,000
There's metal in your car

200
0:09:15.29,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that may well have come from a 1950s Oldsmobile,

201
0:09:18.108,000 --> 0:09:21,000
because you can recycle it infinitely with no loss of performance.

202
0:09:21.283,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Plastics offer about once or twice of recycling,

203
0:09:24.014,000 --> 0:09:26,000
whether it's a bottle, whether it's a chair --

204
0:09:26.212,000 --> 0:09:27,000
whatever it is, if it's carpet --

205
0:09:27.833,000 --> 0:09:3,000
after two times of recycling, whether it goes back into another chair, etc,

206
0:09:31.427,000 --> 0:09:33,000
it tends to lose strength, it's no longer of any use.

207
0:09:33.945,000 --> 0:09:36,000
This, though, just using a few enzymes, is able to recycle it infinitely.

208
0:09:37.46,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I take a bottle or a chair or some other plastic product,

209
0:09:40.929,000 --> 0:09:43,000
I basically put it in with a few enzymes, they break it apart,

210
0:09:44.252,000 --> 0:09:46,000
they basically put it back into its original molecules.

211
0:09:46.89,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And then from those molecules,

212
0:09:48.365,000 --> 0:09:5,000
you can build another chair or carpet or bottle.

213
0:09:51.673,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So, the cycle is infinite.

214
0:09:53.966,000 --> 0:09:54,000
The advantage with that, of course,

215
0:09:55.688,000 --> 0:09:58,000
is that you have potentially zero loss of material resources.

216
0:09:58.966,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Again, the perfect idea of thrift.

217
0:10:02.09,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So in conclusion, I just want to have you think about -- if you make anything,

218
0:10:06.706,000 --> 0:10:07,000
if you're any part of a design firm,

219
0:10:08.499,000 --> 0:10:1,000
if you basically are refurbishing your house --

220
0:10:11.125,000 --> 0:10:13,000
any aspect where you make something,

221
0:10:13.76,000 --> 0:10:16,000
think about how that product could potentially be used

222
0:10:16.998,000 --> 0:10:18,000
as a second life, or third life or fourth life.

223
0:10:19.418,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Design in the ability for it to be taken apart.

224
0:10:23.466,000 --> 0:10:24,000
That, to me, is the ultimate thrift,

225
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and I think that's basically what my grandmother would love.

226
0:10:28.373,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
What I thought I would do

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
is I would start with a simple request.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I'd like all of you

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
to pause for a moment,

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
you wretched weaklings,

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and take stock of your miserable existence.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Now that was the advice

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
in the fifth century.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It was the advice that I decided to follow myself

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
when I turned 40.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Up until that moment, I had been that classic corporate warrior --

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I was eating too much, I was drinking too much,

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I was working too hard

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and I was neglecting the family.

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And I decided that I would try

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and turn my life around.

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
In particular, I decided

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I would try to address the thorny issue

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
of work-life balance.

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So I stepped back from the workforce,

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and I spent a year at home

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
with my wife and four young children.

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But all I learned about work-life balance

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
from that year

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
was that I found it quite easy

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to balance work and life

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
when I didn't have any work.

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Not a very useful skill,

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
especially when the money runs out.

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So I went back to work,

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and I've spent these seven years since

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
struggling with, studying

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and writing about work-life balance.

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And I have four observations

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I'd like to share with you today.

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The first is:

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
if society's to make any progress on this issue,

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
we need an honest debate.

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But the trouble is

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
so many people talk so much rubbish

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
about work-life balance.

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
All the discussions about flexi-time

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
or dress-down Fridays

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
or paternity leave

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
only serve to mask the core issue,

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
which is

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that certain job and career choices

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
are fundamentally incompatible

52
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
with being meaningfully engaged

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
on a day-to-day basis

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
with a young family.

55
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Now the first step in solving any problem

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in.

57
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And the reality of the society that we're in

58
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is there are thousands and thousands

59
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
of people out there

60
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
leading lives of quiet, screaming desperation,

61
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
where they work long, hard hours

62
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
at jobs they hate

63
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to enable them to buy things they don't need

64
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to impress people they don't like.

65
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Laughter)

66
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
(Applause)

67
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
It's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and [a] T-shirt

68
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
isn't really getting to the nub of the issue.

69
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The second observation I'd like to make

71
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
is we need to face the truth

72
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that governments and corporations

73
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
aren't going to solve this issue for us.

74
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We should stop looking outside.

75
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It's up to us as individuals

76
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to take control and responsibility

77
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
for the type of lives that we want to lead.

78
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
If you don't design your life,

79
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
someone else will design it for you,

80
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and you may just not like

81
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
their idea of balance.

82
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It's particularly important --

83
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
this isn't on the World Wide Web, is it? I'm about to get fired --

84
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
it's particularly important

85
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that you never put the quality of your life

86
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
in the hands of a commercial corporation.

87
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies --

88
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the "abattoirs of the human soul," as I call them.

89
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Laughter)

90
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I'm talking about all companies.

91
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Because commercial companies

92
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
are inherently designed

93
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to get as much out of you [as]

94
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
they can get away with.

95
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It's in their nature; it's in their DNA;

96
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
it's what they do --

97
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
even the good, well-intentioned companies.

98
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
On the one hand,

99
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
putting childcare facilities in the workplace

100
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
is wonderful and enlightened.

101
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
On the other hand, it's a nightmare --

102
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
it just means you spend more time at the bloody office.

103
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We have to be responsible

104
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
for setting and enforcing

105
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
the boundaries that we want in our life.

106
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The third observation is

107
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
we have to be careful

108
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
with the time frame that we choose

109
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
upon which to judge our balance.

110
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Before I went back to work

111
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
after my year at home,

112
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I sat down

113
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and I wrote out

114
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
a detailed, step-by-step description

115
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
of the ideal balanced day

116
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that I aspired to.

117
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And it went like this:

118
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
wake up well rested

119
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
after a good night's sleep.

120
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Have sex.

121
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Walk the dog.

122
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Have breakfast with my wife and children.

123
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Have sex again.

124
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Laughter)

125
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Drive the kids to school on the way to the office.

126
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Do three hours' work.

127
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime.

128
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Do another three hours' work.

129
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink.

130
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Drive home for dinner

131
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
with my wife and kids.

132
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Meditate for half an hour.

133
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Have sex.

134
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Walk the dog. Have sex again.

135
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Go to bed.

136
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Applause)

137
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
How often do you think I have that day?

138
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We need to be realistic.

140
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
You can't do it all in one day.

141
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We need to elongate the time frame

142
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
upon which we judge the balance in our life,

143
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
but we need to elongate it

144
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
without falling into the trap

145
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
of the "I'll have a life when I retire,

146
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
when my kids have left home,

147
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
when my wife has divorced me, my health is failing,

148
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I've got no mates or interests left."

149
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Laughter)

150
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
A day is too short; "after I retire" is too long.

151
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
There's got to be a middle way.

152
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
A fourth observation:

153
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We need to approach balance

154
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
in a balanced way.

155
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
A friend came to see me last year --

156
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and she doesn't mind me telling this story -- a friend came to see me last year

157
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and said, "Nigel, I've read your book.

158
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And I realize that my life is completely out of balance.

159
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It's totally dominated by work.

160
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I work 10 hours a day; I commute two hours a day.

161
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
All of my relationships have failed.

162
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
There's nothing in my life

163
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
apart from my work.

164
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So I've decided to get a grip and sort it out.

165
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So I joined a gym."

166
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
(Laughter)

167
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Now I don't mean to mock,

168
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat

169
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
isn't more balanced; it's more fit.

170
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Laughter)

171
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Lovely though physical exercise may be,

172
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
there are other parts to life --

173
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
there's the intellectual side; there's the emotional side;

174
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
there's the spiritual side.

175
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And to be balanced,

176
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I believe we have to attend

177
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to all of those areas --

178
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
not just do 50 stomach crunches.

179
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Now that can be daunting.

180
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Because people say, "Bloody hell mate, I haven't got time to get fit.

181
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
You want me to go to church and call my mother."

182
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And I understand.

183
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I truly understand how that can be daunting.

184
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But an incident that happened a couple of years ago

185
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
gave me a new perspective.

186
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
My wife, who is somewhere in the audience today,

187
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
called me up at the office

188
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and said, "Nigel, you need to pick our youngest son" --

189
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Harry -- "up from school."

190
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening.

191
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
So I left work an hour early that afternoon

192
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and picked Harry up at the school gates.

193
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
We walked down to the local park,

194
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
messed around on the swings, played some silly games.

195
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe,

196
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and we shared a pizza for two,

197
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
then walked down the hill to our home,

198
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and I gave him his bath

199
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and put him in his Batman pajamas.

200
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I then read him a chapter

201
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
of Roald Dahl's "James and the Giant Peach."

202
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I then put him to bed, tucked him in,

203
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
gave him a kiss on his forehead and said, "Goodnight, mate,"

204
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and walked out of his bedroom.

205
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
As I was walking out of his bedroom,

206
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
he said, "Dad?" I went, "Yes, mate?"

207
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
He went, "Dad, this has been the best day

208
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
of my life, ever."

209
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I hadn't done anything,

210
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
hadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation.

211
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Now my point is

212
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
the small things matter.

213
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Being more balanced

214
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
doesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life.

215
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
With the smallest investment

216
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
in the right places,

217
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
you can radically transform the quality of your relationships

218
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and the quality of your life.

219
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Moreover, I think,

220
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
it can transform society.

221
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Because if enough people do it,

222
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
we can change society's definition of success

223
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
away from the moronically simplistic notion

224
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that the person with the most money when he dies wins,

225
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
to a more thoughtful and balanced definition

226
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
of what a life well lived looks like.

227
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And that, I think,

228
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
is an idea worth spreading.

229
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Applause)

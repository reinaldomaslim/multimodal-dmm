1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space,

2
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
architecture is nothing but a special-effects machine

3
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that delights and disturbs the senses.

4
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Our work is across media. The work comes in all shapes and sizes.

5
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It's small and large. This is an ashtray, a water glass.

6
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
From urban planning and master planning

7
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
to theater and all sorts of stuff.

8
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
The thing that all the work has in common

9
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space.

10
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And these are everyday conventions,

11
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity.

12
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And I've assembled a sampling of work

13
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that all share a kind of productive nihilism

14
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that's used in the service of creating a particular special effect.

15
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And that is something like nothing, or something next to nothing.

16
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference

17
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through.

18
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
This is an image that won us a competition

19
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
for an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo 2002

20
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
on Lake Neuchatel, near Geneva.

21
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And we wanted to use the water not only as a context,

22
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
but as a primary building material.

23
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
We wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere.

24
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So, no walls, no roof, no purpose --

25
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
just a mass of atomized water, a big cloud.

26
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And this proposal was a reaction to the over-saturation

27
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
of emergent technologies in recent national and world expositions,

28
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
which feeds, or has been feeding, our insatiable appetite

29
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
for visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity.

30
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
High definition, in our opinion, has become the new orthodoxy.

31
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And we ask the question, can we use technology, high technology,

32
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to make an expo pavilion that's decidedly low definition,

33
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that also challenges the conventions of space and skin,

34
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and rethinks our dependence on vision?

35
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So this is how we sought to do it.

36
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Water's pumped from the lake and is filtered

37
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles,

38
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
35,000 of them. And a weather station is on the structure.

39
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It reads the shifting conditions of temperature, humidity,

40
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
wind direction, wind speed, dew point,

41
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and it processes this data in a central computer

42
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that calibrates the degree of water pressure

43
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and distribution of water throughout.

44
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And it's a responsive system that's trained on actual weather.

45
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So, this is just in construction, and there's a tensegrity structure.

46
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It's about 300 feet wide, the size of a football field,

47
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and it sits on just four very delicate columns.

48
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
These are the fog nozzles, the interface,

49
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and basically the system is kind of reading the real weather,

50
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and producing kind of semi-artificial and real weather.

51
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So, we're very interested in creating weather. I don't know why.

52
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Now, here we go, one side, the outside

53
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and then from the inside of the space

54
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
you can see what the quality of the space was.

55
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Unlike entering any normal space,

56
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
entering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium.

57
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It's formless, featureless, depthless, scaleless, massless,

58
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
purposeless and dimensionless.

59
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
All references are erased,

60
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
leaving only an optical whiteout and white noise of the pulsing nozzles.

61
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So, this is an exhibition pavilion

62
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do.

63
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And we pride ourselves -- it's a spectacular anti-spectacle

64
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
in which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head.

65
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So, the audience is dispersed,

66
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
focused attention and dramatic build-up and climax

67
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
are all replaced by a kind of attenuated attention

68
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that's sustained by a sense of apprehension caused by the fog.

69
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And this is very much like how the Victorian novel used fog in this way.

70
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So here the world is put out of focus,

71
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
while our visual dependence is put into focus.

72
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The public, you know, once disoriented

73
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
can actually ascend to the angel deck above

74
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and then just come down under those lips into the water bar.

75
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So, all the waters of the world are served there,

76
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
so we thought that, you know, after being at the water

77
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and moving through the water and breathing the water,

78
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
you could also drink this building.

79
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And so it is sort of a theme,

80
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
but it goes a little bit, you know, deeper than that.

81
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
We really wanted to bring out

82
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
our absolute dependence on this master sense,

83
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses.

84
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
You know, when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell,

85
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
because the Swiss said, "Well, why are we going to spend, you know,

86
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
10 million dollars producing an effect

87
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that we already have in natural abundance that we hate?"

88
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And, you know, we thought -- well, we tried to convince them.

89
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And in the end, you know, they adapted this as a national icon

90
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that came to represent Swiss doubt, which we -- you know,

91
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
it was kind of a meaning machine

92
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of.

93
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Anyway, it's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed,

94
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and so it's now a memory of an apparition, actually,

95
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
but it continues to live in edible form.

96
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And this is the highest honor

97
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland -- to have a chocolate bar.

98
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Anyway, moving along.

99
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So in the '80s and '90s, we were mostly known for independent work,

100
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
such as installation artist, architect,

101
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
commissioned projects by museums and non-for-profit organizations.

102
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And we did a lot of media work,

103
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
also a lot of experimental theater projects.

104
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
In 2003, the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work

105
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that featured a lot of this work from the '80s and '90s.

106
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
However, the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective,

107
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show.

108
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
This was a piece on tourism in the United States.

109
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
This is "Soft Sell" for 42nd Street.

110
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
This was something done at the Cartier Foundation.

111
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
"Master/Slave" at the MOMA, the project series, a piece called "Parasite."

112
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And so there were many, many of these kinds of projects.

113
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Anyway, they gave us the whole fourth floor, and, you know,

114
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
the problem of the retrospective

115
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
was something we were very uncomfortable with.

116
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
It's a kind of invention of the museum

117
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that's supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding

118
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
to the public of a body of work.

119
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And our work doesn't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all.

120
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And one of the recurring themes, by the way, that in the work

121
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
was a kind of hostility toward the museum itself,

122
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and asking about the conventions of the museum, like the wall, the white wall.

123
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So, what you see here

124
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
is basically a plan of many installations that were put there.

125
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And we actually had to install white walls

126
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to separate these pieces, which didn't belong together.

127
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
But these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time.

128
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
We used the wall to partition the 13 installations of the project

129
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation.

130
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And what you see is -- actually,

131
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element,

132
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
which was a new piece that created -- that we created for the --

133
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
which was a robotic drill, basically, that went all the way around,

134
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
cruised the museum, went all around the walls and did a lot of damage.

135
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So, the drill was mounted on this robotic arm.

136
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
We worked with, by the way, Honeybee Robotics. This is the brain.

137
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Honeybee Robotics designed the Mars Driller,

138
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and it was really very much fun to work with them.

139
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
They weren't doing their primary work, which was for the government,

140
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
while they were helping us with this.

141
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
In any case, the way it works is that

142
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls.

143
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So, unfolded it's about 300 linear feet.

144
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And it randomly generates points within a three-dimensional matrix.

145
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It selects a point, it guides the drill to that point, it pierces the dry wall,

146
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
leaving a half-inch hole before traveling to the next location.

147
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Initially these holes were lone blemishes,

148
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and as the exhibition continued

149
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
the walls became increasingly perforated.

150
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So eventually holes on both sides of the wall aligned,

151
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
opening views from gallery to gallery.

152
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Clusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall.

153
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And so this was a three-month performance piece

154
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element.

155
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And also the acoustic separation was destroyed.

156
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Also the visual separation.

157
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And there was also this constant background groan, which was very annoying.

158
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And this is one of the blackout spaces

159
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
where there's a video piece that became totally not useful.

160
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display,

161
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
the wall now actively competed for attention.

162
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance

163
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
basically exposed the discomfort of the work

164
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to this encompassing nature of the retrospective.

165
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text.

166
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago.

167
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
It's the ICA -- the Institute of Contemporary Art -- in Boston,

168
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
which is on the waterfront.

169
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And there's not enough time to really introduce the building,

170
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
but I'll simply say that the building negotiates

171
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
between this outwardly focused nature of the site --

172
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
you know, it's a really great waterfront site in Boston --

173
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum.

174
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So, the nature of the building is that it looks at looking --

175
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I mean that's its primary objective,

176
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
both its program and its architectural conceit.

177
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
The building incorporates the site,

178
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
but it dispenses it in very small doses

179
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
in the way that the museum is choreographed.

180
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
So, you come in and you're basically squeezed by the theater,

181
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
by the belly of the theater, into this very compressed space

182
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
where the view is turned off.

183
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall.

184
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
This elevator's about the size of a New York City studio apartment.

185
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And then, this is a view going up,

186
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and then you could come into the theater,

187
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop.

188
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open.

189
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
The view is denied in the galleries

190
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
where we receive just natural light,

191
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view.

192
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
The original intention of this space,

193
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
which was unfortunately never realized,

194
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
was to use lenticular glass

195
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out.

196
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
In this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries

197
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
the intention was really to not get a climax,

198
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
but to have the view stalk you,

199
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
so the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other.

200
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
This was eliminated because the view was too good,

201
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and the mayor said, "No, we just want this open."

202
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
The architect lost here.

203
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
But culminating -- and that's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk --

204
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
is this Mediatheque,

205
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building.

206
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
So this is an 80-foot cantilever -- it's quite substantial.

207
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
So, it's already sticking out into space enough,

208
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and then from that is this, is this small area called the Mediatheque.

209
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
The Mediatheque has something like 16 stations

210
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
where the public can get onto the server

211
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web.

212
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And this was really a kind of very important part of this building,

213
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and here is a point where architecture --

214
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
this is like technology-free -- architecture is only a framing device,

215
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
it only edits the harbor view, the industrial harbor

216
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
just through its walls, its floors and its ceiling,

217
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
to only expose the water itself, the texture of water,

218
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow

219
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
or a lava lamp or something like that.

220
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence

221
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
of the technological and the natural in the project.

222
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
But there is just no information, it's just -- it's just hypnosis.

223
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Moving along to Lincoln Center.

224
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
These are the guys that did the project in the first place, 50 years ago.

225
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
We're taking over now, doing work that ranges in scale

226
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
from small-scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions.

227
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
But we're doing it with a lot less testosterone.

228
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
This is the extent of the work that's to be completed by 2010.

229
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And for the purposes of this talk,

230
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
I wanted to isolate just a part of a project that's even a part of a project

231
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects,

232
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and it happens to be our current obsession,

233
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction.

234
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
It's Alice Tully Hall, and it's tucked under the Juilliard Building

235
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and descends several levels under the street.

236
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
So, this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be,

237
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
before the renovation, which we just started.

238
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And we asked ourselves, why couldn't it be exhibitionistic,

239
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
like the Met, or like some of the other buildings at Lincoln Center?

240
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And one of the things that we were asked to do

241
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
was give it a street identity, expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible.

242
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And this building, which is just naturally hermetic, we stripped.

243
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
We basically did a striptease, architectural striptease,

244
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
where we're framing with this kind of canopy --

245
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
the underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard,

246
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
about 45,000 square feet -- cutting it to the angle of Broadway,

247
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and then exposing, using that canopy to frame Tully Hall.

248
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Before and after shot. (Applause)

249
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Wait a minute, it's just in that state, we have a long way to go.

250
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
But what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left

251
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
to just talk about the hall itself,

252
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
which is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work.

253
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
So, the hall is a multi-purpose hall.

254
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
The clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall.

255
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Now, that's really tough to do with a hall that has 1,100 seats.

256
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons

257
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and small-scale performances. They asked us to bring an intimacy.

258
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
How do you bring an intimacy into a hall?

259
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Intimacy for us means a lot of different things.

260
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
It means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy.

261
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
One thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall.

262
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall.

263
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
It's like a coffin, it basically sends all the sound,

264
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
like a gutter-ball effect, down the aisles.

265
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
The walls are made of absorptive surface,

266
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
half absorptive, half reflective,

267
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
which is not very good for concert sound.

268
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
This is Avery Fisher Hall, but the notion of junk -- visual junk --

269
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
was very, very important to us, to get rid of visual noise.

270
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Because we can't eliminate a single seat,

271
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:38,000
the architecture is restricted to 18 inches.

272
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
So it's a very, very thin architecture.

273
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
First we do a kind of partial box and box separation,

274
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
to take away the distraction of the subway noise.

275
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Next we wrap the entire hall -- almost like this Olivetti keyboard --

276
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
with a material, with a wood material

277
0:16:55.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
that basically covers all the surfaces:

278
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:01,000
wall, ceiling, floor, stage, steps, everything, boxes.

279
0:17:01.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
But it's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house

280
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
and back to the stage. And here's an acoustic shelf.

281
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Looking up the hall. Just a section of the stage.

282
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
Just everything is lined, it incorporates --

283
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
every single thing that you could possibly imagine

284
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
is tucked into this high-performance skin.

285
0:17:18.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
But one more added feature.

286
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:23,000
So now that we've stripped the hall of all visual distraction,

287
0:17:23.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
everything that prevents this intimacy

288
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
which is supposed to connect the house, the audience,

289
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:33,000
with the performers, we add one little detail,

290
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
one piece of architectural excess, a special effect: lighting.

291
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
We very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall

292
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival

293
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
as it is when the concert starts.

294
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:51,000
So what we wanted to do was produce this effect,

295
0:17:51.16,000 --> 0:17:53,000
this lighting effect,

296
0:17:53.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls.

297
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
And what it entails is the use of resin, of this very thick resin

298
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
with a veneer of the same kind of wood that's used throughout the hall,

299
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:11,000
in a kind of seamless continuity

300
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:16,000
that wraps the hall in light, like a belt of light: rather than separating,

301
0:18:16.16,000 --> 0:18:2,000
like a proscenium would separate the audience from performers,

302
0:18:20.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
it connects audience with players.

303
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
And this is a mockup that is in Salt Lake City

304
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:33,000
that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale.

305
0:18:33.16,000 --> 0:18:36,000
And this is a guy from Salt Lake City,

306
0:18:36.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
this is what they look like out there.

307
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
(Laughter)

308
0:18:41.16,000 --> 0:18:44,000
And for us, I mean it's really kind of a very strange thing,

309
0:18:44.16,000 --> 0:18:5,000
but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down

310
0:18:50.16,000 --> 0:18:53,000
when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin,

311
0:18:53.16,000 --> 0:18:57,000
very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier,

312
0:18:57.16,000 --> 0:19:03,000
the walls will just exude this glow, temporarily stealing attention from the stage.

313
0:19:03.16,000 --> 0:19:07,000
And this is Tully in construction now.

314
0:19:07.16,000 --> 0:19:11,000
I have no ending to say, except that I'm a couple of minutes over.

315
0:19:11.16,000 --> 0:19:13,000
Thank you very much.

316
0:19:13.16,000 --> 0:19:15,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.809,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I once had this nightmare:

2
0:00:15.007,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm standing in the middle of a deserted field full of land mines.

3
0:00:19.571,000 --> 0:00:21,000
In real life, I love to hike,

4
0:00:22.06,000 --> 0:00:25,000
but every time I want to go on a hike, it makes me nervous.

5
0:00:26.327,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I have this thought in the back of my mind

6
0:00:28.875,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that I might lose a limb.

7
0:00:31.402,000 --> 0:00:33,000
This underlying fear started 10 years ago,

8
0:00:34.125,000 --> 0:00:37,000
after I met Mohammed, a cluster bomb survivor

9
0:00:37.447,000 --> 0:00:4,000
of the summer 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War in Lebanon.

10
0:00:42.303,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Mohammed, like so many other survivors all around the world,

11
0:00:45.581,000 --> 0:00:49,000
had to live through the horrifying repercussions of cluster munitions

12
0:00:50.592,000 --> 0:00:51,000
on a daily basis.

13
0:00:53.122,000 --> 0:00:55,000
When the one-month conflict started in Lebanon,

14
0:00:55.785,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I was still working at Agence France-Presse in Paris.

15
0:00:59.837,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I remember how I was glued to the screens,

16
0:01:02.463,000 --> 0:01:04,000
anxiously following the news.

17
0:01:05.155,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I wanted to reassure myself

18
0:01:06.862,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that the falling bombs missed my parents' home.

19
0:01:10.773,000 --> 0:01:13,000
When I arrived in Beirut on assignment to cover that war,

20
0:01:14.335,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I was relieved to be united with my family,

21
0:01:16.827,000 --> 0:01:19,000
after they had finally managed to escape southern Lebanon.

22
0:01:20.744,000 --> 0:01:21,000
The day the war was over,

23
0:01:22.567,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I remember seeing this image --

24
0:01:24.742,000 --> 0:01:25,000
one of blocked roads,

25
0:01:26.209,000 --> 0:01:3,000
of displaced people eagerly rushing south, back to their homes,

26
0:01:30.362,000 --> 0:01:32,000
regardless of what they would find.

27
0:01:33.374,000 --> 0:01:36,000
An estimated four million cluster submunitions

28
0:01:36.468,000 --> 0:01:39,000
were spread in Lebanon during the 34-day conflict.

29
0:01:42.462,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Mohammed lost both legs during the last week of the conflict.

30
0:01:46.826,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The fact that he lives a five-minute drive from my parents' home

31
0:01:49.901,000 --> 0:01:51,000
made it easier to follow him through the years.

32
0:01:52.68,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It was now almost 10 years since we first met.

33
0:01:56.309,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I saw the young boy

34
0:01:57.884,000 --> 0:02:,000
who had to endure physical and emotional trauma.

35
0:02:02.277,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I saw the teenager who tried to offer his friends tattoos,

36
0:02:05.633,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in return for a set fee of five dollars.

37
0:02:09.17,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And I know the young, jobless man who spends hours surfing the Internet

38
0:02:13.337,000 --> 0:02:16,000
trying to meet a girl who might become his girlfriend.

39
0:02:17.408,000 --> 0:02:2,000
His fate and the effects of losing his legs

40
0:02:20.946,000 --> 0:02:21,000
are now his daily reality.

41
0:02:23.578,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Survivors of bomb trauma like Mohammed

42
0:02:25.991,000 --> 0:02:28,000
have to deal with so many details that never occur to us.

43
0:02:29.817,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Who would have imagined

44
0:02:31.017,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that so many daily tasks we do or take for granted,

45
0:02:33.776,000 --> 0:02:37,000
such as going to the beach or even picking up something from the floor,

46
0:02:38.053,000 --> 0:02:41,000
would become sources of stress and anxiety?

47
0:02:41.886,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Well, that's what eventually became of Mohammed,

48
0:02:44.221,000 --> 0:02:46,000
due to his inflexible prosthetic legs.

49
0:02:48.465,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Ten years ago, I had no clue what a cluster bomb was,

50
0:02:52.159,000 --> 0:02:54,000
nor its horrifying implications.

51
0:02:54.835,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I learned that this indiscriminate weapon was used

52
0:02:57.296,000 --> 0:02:58,000
in so many parts of the world

53
0:02:58.835,000 --> 0:03:,000
and continues to kill on a regular basis,

54
0:03:01.131,000 --> 0:03:04,000
without distinguishing between a military target

55
0:03:04.194,000 --> 0:03:05,000
or a child.

56
0:03:06.141,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I naively asked myself,

57
0:03:08.006,000 --> 0:03:11,000
"But seriously, who made those weapons?

58
0:03:11.847,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And what for?"

59
0:03:13.687,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Let me explain to you what a cluster bomb is.

60
0:03:16.179,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It's a large canister filled with bomblets.

61
0:03:19.377,000 --> 0:03:2,000
When it's dropped from the air,

62
0:03:21.064,000 --> 0:03:25,000
it opens up in midair to release hundreds of bomblets.

63
0:03:25.632,000 --> 0:03:27,000
They scatter around wide areas

64
0:03:27.774,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and on impact,

65
0:03:28.951,000 --> 0:03:29,000
many fail to explode.

66
0:03:31.348,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Those unexploded ones end up just like landmines --

67
0:03:34.593,000 --> 0:03:35,000
sitting on the ground,

68
0:03:35.85,000 --> 0:03:36,000
waiting for their next target.

69
0:03:38.56,000 --> 0:03:4,000
If someone steps on them by accident

70
0:03:41.038,000 --> 0:03:42,000
or picks them up,

71
0:03:42.22,000 --> 0:03:43,000
they can explode.

72
0:03:44.283,000 --> 0:03:46,000
These weapons are extremely unpredictable,

73
0:03:47.19,000 --> 0:03:49,000
which makes the threat even bigger.

74
0:03:49.243,000 --> 0:03:52,000
One day, a farmer can work his land without a problem.

75
0:03:52.366,000 --> 0:03:55,000
The next day, he can make fire and burn some branches,

76
0:03:56.345,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and the submunitions close by could be set off because of the heat.

77
0:04:00.762,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The problem is children mistake those bomblets for toys,

78
0:04:04.335,000 --> 0:04:07,000
because they can look like bouncy balls or soda cans.

79
0:04:08.943,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Being a documentary photographer,

80
0:04:10.833,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I decided to go back to Lebanon a few months after the conflict ended

81
0:04:14.996,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to meet cluster bomb survivors.

82
0:04:16.993,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And I met a few --

83
0:04:18.168,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Hussein and Rasha,

84
0:04:19.765,000 --> 0:04:21,000
who both lost a leg to submunitions.

85
0:04:22.143,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Their stories are similar to so many other kids' stories across the world

86
0:04:26.383,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and are a testimony to the horrifying implications

87
0:04:29.456,000 --> 0:04:31,000
of the continuous use of such weapons.

88
0:04:33.332,000 --> 0:04:36,000
That's when I met Mohammed, in January 2007.

89
0:04:37.427,000 --> 0:04:38,000
He was 11 years old,

90
0:04:38.731,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and I met him exactly four months after his accident.

91
0:04:42.777,000 --> 0:04:43,000
When I first saw him,

92
0:04:43.952,000 --> 0:04:45,000
he was going through painful physiotherapy

93
0:04:46.095,000 --> 0:04:47,000
to recover from his fresh wounds.

94
0:04:48.547,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Still in shock at such a young age,

95
0:04:50.843,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Mohammed was struggling to get used to his new body.

96
0:04:54.65,000 --> 0:04:58,000
He would even wake up sometimes at night wanting to scratch his lost feet.

97
0:05:00.187,000 --> 0:05:03,000
What drew me closer to his story was my instant realization

98
0:05:03.9,000 --> 0:05:06,000
of the difficulties Mohammed was likely to face in the future --

99
0:05:07.997,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that what he has been suffering while adjusting to his injury

100
0:05:11.346,000 --> 0:05:12,000
at the age of 11,

101
0:05:13.04,000 --> 0:05:14,000
would increase manyfold.

102
0:05:15.771,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Even before his disability,

103
0:05:17.385,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Mohammed's life wasn't easy.

104
0:05:19.626,000 --> 0:05:22,000
He was born in the Rashidieh Camp for Palestinian refugees,

105
0:05:22.93,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and this is where he still lives.

106
0:05:25.103,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Lebanon holds some 400,000 Palestinian refugees,

107
0:05:28.849,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and they suffer from discriminatory laws.

108
0:05:31.662,000 --> 0:05:33,000
They're not allowed to work in the public sector

109
0:05:34.259,000 --> 0:05:35,000
or practice certain professions

110
0:05:36.266,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and are denied the right to own property.

111
0:05:39.278,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This is one of the reasons

112
0:05:40.557,000 --> 0:05:42,000
why Mohammed doesn't really regret dropping out of school

113
0:05:43.324,000 --> 0:05:44,000
right after his injury.

114
0:05:45.397,000 --> 0:05:48,000
He said, "What's the point of a university degree

115
0:05:48.96,000 --> 0:05:5,000
when I can't find a job to start with?"

116
0:05:53.046,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Cluster bomb use creates a vicious circle of impact on communities,

117
0:05:57.284,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and not only the lives of their victims.

118
0:05:59.993,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Many who get injured by this weapon drop out of school,

119
0:06:03.832,000 --> 0:06:05,000
can't find jobs or even lose their jobs,

120
0:06:06.293,000 --> 0:06:09,000
therefore losing the ability to provide for their families.

121
0:06:09.887,000 --> 0:06:12,000
This is not to mention the continuous physical pain

122
0:06:13.238,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and the experience of feeling isolated.

123
0:06:17.512,000 --> 0:06:2,000
These weapons affect the poorest of the poor.

124
0:06:20.624,000 --> 0:06:22,000
The high medical cost is a burden to the families.

125
0:06:23.884,000 --> 0:06:26,000
They end up relying on humanitarian agencies,

126
0:06:26.955,000 --> 0:06:28,000
which is insufficient and unsustainable,

127
0:06:29.508,000 --> 0:06:32,000
especially when injuries require lifelong support to the injured.

128
0:06:33.704,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Ten years after Mohammed's injury,

129
0:06:35.566,000 --> 0:06:38,000
he is still unable to afford proper prosthetic legs.

130
0:06:39.856,000 --> 0:06:4,000
He's very cautious with his steps,

131
0:06:41.685,000 --> 0:06:43,000
as a couple of falls over the years

132
0:06:43.727,000 --> 0:06:45,000
brought him embarrassment among his friends.

133
0:06:47.218,000 --> 0:06:49,000
He joked that since he doesn't have legs,

134
0:06:49.321,000 --> 0:06:51,000
some days he tries to walk on his hands.

135
0:06:53.054,000 --> 0:06:56,000
One of the worst yet invisible impacts of the weapon

136
0:06:56.436,000 --> 0:06:58,000
is the psychological scars it leaves.

137
0:06:59.348,000 --> 0:07:01,000
In one of Mohammed's early medical reports,

138
0:07:01.688,000 --> 0:07:04,000
he was diagnosed with signs of PTSD.

139
0:07:04.755,000 --> 0:07:09,000
He suffered from anxiety, poor appetite, sleep disturbance

140
0:07:10.011,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and showed signs of anger.

141
0:07:13.197,000 --> 0:07:17,000
The reality is Mohammed never received proper help to fully recover.

142
0:07:18.271,000 --> 0:07:22,000
His current obsession is to leave Lebanon at any cost --

143
0:07:22.511,000 --> 0:07:24,000
even if it meant embarking on a hazardous journey

144
0:07:25.4,000 --> 0:07:29,000
along with refugees drifting towards Europe today through the Mediterranean.

145
0:07:31.034,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Knowing how risky such a journey would be,

146
0:07:33.319,000 --> 0:07:36,000
he said, "If I were to die on the way,

147
0:07:36.463,000 --> 0:07:37,000
it doesn't matter."

148
0:07:37.747,000 --> 0:07:4,000
To Mohammed, he is dead here, anyway.

149
0:07:42.294,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Cluster bombs are a world problem,

150
0:07:45.326,000 --> 0:07:49,000
as this munition keeps destroying and hurting whole communities

151
0:07:50.011,000 --> 0:07:51,000
for generations to come.

152
0:07:52.618,000 --> 0:07:55,000
In an online interview with the director of the Mines Advisory Group,

153
0:07:56.156,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Jamie Franklin,

154
0:07:57.331,000 --> 0:07:58,000
he said,

155
0:07:58.511,000 --> 0:08:02,000
"The US forces dropped over two million tons of munitions over Laos.

156
0:08:03.57,000 --> 0:08:05,000
If they couldn't find their targets in Vietnam,

157
0:08:06.279,000 --> 0:08:1,000
there were free-drop areas in Laos where planes would drop their loads

158
0:08:10.6,000 --> 0:08:11,000
before going back to base,

159
0:08:12.619,000 --> 0:08:15,000
because it's dangerous to land with loaded planes."

160
0:08:16.653,000 --> 0:08:18,000
According to the International Committee of the Red Cross,

161
0:08:19.439,000 --> 0:08:22,000
in Laos alone -- one of the poorest countries in the world --

162
0:08:22.819,000 --> 0:08:26,000
nine to 27 million unexploded submunitions remain.

163
0:08:28.238,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Some 11,000 people have been killed or injured since 1973.

164
0:08:34.691,000 --> 0:08:38,000
This lethal weapon has been used by over 20 states during armed conflicts

165
0:08:39.603,000 --> 0:08:41,000
in over 35 countries,

166
0:08:41.785,000 --> 0:08:44,000
such as Ukraine, Iraq and Sudan.

167
0:08:46.403,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So far, 119 states have joined an international treaty

168
0:08:50.713,000 --> 0:08:51,000
banning cluster bombs,

169
0:08:52.448,000 --> 0:08:55,000
which is officially called the Convention on Cluster Munitions.

170
0:08:56.417,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But some of the biggest producers of cluster munitions --

171
0:08:59.891,000 --> 0:09:02,000
namely, the United States, Russia and China --

172
0:09:03.254,000 --> 0:09:05,000
remain outside of this lifesaving treaty

173
0:09:05.748,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and continue to produce them,

174
0:09:07.709,000 --> 0:09:09,000
reserve the right to produce them in the future,

175
0:09:10.552,000 --> 0:09:12,000
keep those harmful weapons in their stockpiles

176
0:09:13.302,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and even possibly use them in the future.

177
0:09:17.52,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Cluster bombs have reportedly been used most recently

178
0:09:21.736,000 --> 0:09:24,000
in the ongoing conflicts in Yemen and Syria.

179
0:09:26.122,000 --> 0:09:28,000
According to research on the worldwide investments

180
0:09:28.909,000 --> 0:09:29,000
in cluster munitions producers

181
0:09:30.559,000 --> 0:09:32,000
by Pax, a Dutch-based NGO,

182
0:09:33.38,000 --> 0:09:36,000
financial institutions invested billions of US dollars

183
0:09:37.28,000 --> 0:09:39,000
into companies that make cluster munitions.

184
0:09:40.66,000 --> 0:09:43,000
The majority of these institutions are based in countries

185
0:09:44.532,000 --> 0:09:47,000
that have not yet signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions.

186
0:09:49.114,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Getting back to Mohammed,

187
0:09:51.165,000 --> 0:09:54,000
one of the few jobs he was able to find was picking lemons.

188
0:09:55.505,000 --> 0:09:58,000
When I ask him if it's safe to work in the field he said,

189
0:09:59.091,000 --> 0:10:,000
"I'm not sure."

190
0:10:01.021,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Research shows that cluster munitions often contaminate areas

191
0:10:05.715,000 --> 0:10:08,000
where agriculture is the main source of income.

192
0:10:10.014,000 --> 0:10:12,000
According to Handicap International's research,

193
0:10:12.914,000 --> 0:10:17,000
98 percent of those killed or injured by cluster munitions are civilians.

194
0:10:19.479,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Eighty-four percent of casualties are males.

195
0:10:23.074,000 --> 0:10:25,000
In countries where these people have no choice

196
0:10:25.831,000 --> 0:10:27,000
but to work in those fields,

197
0:10:27.911,000 --> 0:10:28,000
they simply do it

198
0:10:29.591,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and risk it.

199
0:10:31.914,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Mohammed is the only male to three sisters.

200
0:10:35.006,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Culturally, he's expected to provide for his family,

201
0:10:38.356,000 --> 0:10:39,000
but he simply can't.

202
0:10:40.117,000 --> 0:10:42,000
He tried to have so many different jobs,

203
0:10:42.225,000 --> 0:10:45,000
but he couldn't keep any due to his physical disability

204
0:10:45.815,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and the less-than-friendly environment to people with disabilities,

205
0:10:49.304,000 --> 0:10:5,000
to say the least.

206
0:10:51.583,000 --> 0:10:54,000
It hurts him a lot when he goes out looking for a job,

207
0:10:54.935,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and he's turned away

208
0:10:56.152,000 --> 0:10:58,000
with a small amount of money paid to him out of pity.

209
0:10:59.65,000 --> 0:11:01,000
He said, "I'm not here to beg for money,

210
0:11:02.405,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I just want to earn it."

211
0:11:05.764,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Mohammed today is 21 years old.

212
0:11:08.206,000 --> 0:11:09,000
He's illiterate,

213
0:11:09.428,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and he communicates with voice messages.

214
0:11:12.521,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Here is one of his messages.

215
0:11:15.234,000 --> 0:11:19,000
(Audio) Mohammed: (Speaking in Arabic)

216
0:11:23.325,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Laura Boushnak: He said, "My dream is to run,

217
0:11:25.924,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and I'm pretty sure once I start running,

218
0:11:28.125,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I would never stop."

219
0:11:29.659,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Thank you.

220
0:11:30.866,000 --> 0:11:34,000
(Applause)

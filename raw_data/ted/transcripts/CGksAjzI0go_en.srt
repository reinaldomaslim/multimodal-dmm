1
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's hard to believe that it's less than a year since the extraordinary moment

2
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
when the finance, the credit, which drives our economies froze.

3
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
A massive cardiac arrest.

4
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The effect, the payback, perhaps, for years of vampire predators like Bernie Madoff,

5
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
whom we saw earlier.

6
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Abuse of steroids, binging and so on.

7
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And it's only a few months since governments

8
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
injected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat.

9
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And we're now in a very strange sort of twilight zone,

10
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
where no one quite knows what's worked, or what doesn't.

11
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
We don't have any very clear maps, any compass to guide us.

12
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
We don't know which experts to believe anymore.

13
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
What I'm going to try and do is to give some pointers

14
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to what I think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis,

15
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
what things we should be looking out for

16
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and how we can actually use the crisis.

17
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
There's a definition of leadership which says,

18
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
"It's the ability to use the smallest possible crisis

19
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
for the biggest possible effect."

20
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And I want to talk about how we ensure that this crisis,

21
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
which is by no means small, really is used to the full.

22
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I want to start just by saying a bit about where I'm coming from.

23
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I've got a very confused background

24
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
which perhaps makes me appropriate for confused times.

25
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I've got a Ph.D. in Telecoms, as you can see.

26
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I trained briefly as a Buddhist monk under this guy.

27
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I've been a civil servant,

28
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and I've been in charge of policy for this guy as well.

29
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But what I want to talk about begins when I was at this city, this university, as a student.

30
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
And then as now, it was a beautiful place of balls and punts, beautiful people,

31
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
many of whom took to heart Ronald Reagan's comment

32
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that, "even if they say hard work doesn't do you any harm,

33
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
why risk it?"

34
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But when I was here,

35
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
a lot of my fellow teenagers were in a very different situation,

36
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
leaving school at a time then of rapidly growing youth unemployment,

37
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and essentially hitting a brick wall in terms of their opportunities.

38
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And I spent quite a lot of time with them rather than in punts.

39
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And they were people who were not short of wit, or grace or energy,

40
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
but they had no hope, no jobs, no prospects.

41
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And when people aren't allowed to be useful,

42
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
they soon think that they're useless.

43
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And although that was great for the music business at the time,

44
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
it wasn't much good for anything else.

45
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And ever since then, I've wondered why it is that capitalism

46
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
is so amazingly efficient at some things, but so inefficient at others,

47
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
why it's so innovative in some ways and so un-innovative in others.

48
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Now, since that time,

49
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
we've actually been through an extraordinary boom,

50
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
the longest boom ever in the history of this country.

51
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Unprecedented wealth and prosperity,

52
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
but that growth hasn't always delivered what we needed.

53
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
H.L. Mencken once said that, "to every complex problem,

54
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
there is a simple solution and it's wrong."

55
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But I'm not saying growth is wrong,

56
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
but it's very striking that throughout the years of growth,

57
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
many things didn't get better.

58
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Rates of depression carried on up, right across the Western world.

59
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
If you look at America, the proportion of Americans

60
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
with no one to talk to about important things

61
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
went up from a tenth to a quarter.

62
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We commuted longer to work, but as you can see from this graph,

63
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
the longer you commute the less happy you're likely to be.

64
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And it became ever clearer that economic growth

65
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
doesn't automatically translate into social growth or human growth.

66
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We're now at another moment

67
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
when another wave of teenagers are entering a cruel job market.

68
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
There will be a million unemployed young people here

69
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
by the end of the year,

70
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
thousands losing their jobs everyday in America.

71
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
We've got to do whatever we can to help them,

72
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
but we've also got to ask, I think, a more profound question

73
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
of whether we use this crisis to jump forward

74
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
to a different kind of economy that's more suited to human needs,

75
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to a better balance of economy and society.

76
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And I think one of the lessons of history is that

77
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
even the deepest crises can be moments of opportunity.

78
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
They bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream.

79
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
They often lead to the acceleration of much-needed reforms.

80
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And you saw that in the '30s,

81
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
when the Great Depression paved the way

82
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
for Bretton Woods, welfare states and so on.

83
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And I think you can see around us now,

84
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
some of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism

85
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
which could grow.

86
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
You can see it in daily life.

87
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
When times are hard, people have to do things for themselves,

88
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and right across the world, Oxford, Omaha, Omsk,

89
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
you can see an extraordinary explosion of urban farming,

90
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
people taking over land, taking over roofs,

91
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
turning barges into temporary farms.

92
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And I'm a very small part of this.

93
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I have 60,000 of these things in my garden.

94
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
A few of these. This is Atilla the hen.

95
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And I'm a very small part of a very large movement,

96
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
which for some people is about survival,

97
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but is also about values, about a different kind of economy,

98
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
which isn't so much about consumption and credit,

99
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
but about things which matter to us.

100
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And everywhere too, you can see a proliferation of time banks

101
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and parallel currencies,

102
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
people using smart technologies to link up

103
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
all the resources freed up by the market -- people, buildings, land --

104
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and linking them to whomever has got the most compelling needs.

105
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
There's a similar story, I think, for governments.

106
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Ronald Reagan, again, said the two funniest sentences

107
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
in the English language are,

108
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
"I'm from the government. And I'm here to help."

109
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But I think last year when governments did step in,

110
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
people were quite glad that they were there, that they did act.

111
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But now, a few months on,

112
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
however good politicians are at swallowing frogs

113
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
without pulling a face, as someone once put it,

114
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
they can't hide their uncertainty.

115
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Because it's already clear

116
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
how much of the enormous amount of money they put into the economy,

117
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
really went into fixing the past, bailing out the banks, the car companies,

118
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
not preparing us for the future.

119
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
How much of the money is going into concrete and boosting consumption,

120
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
not into solving the really profound problems we have to solve.

121
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And everywhere, as people think about the unprecedented sums

122
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
which are being spent of our money and our children's money,

123
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
now, in the depth of this crisis, they're asking:

124
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Surely, we should be using this with a longer-term vision

125
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to accelerate the shift to a green economy,

126
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to prepare for aging, to deal with some of the inequalities

127
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
which scar countries like this and the United States

128
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
rather than just giving the money to the incumbents?

129
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Surely, we should be giving the money to entrepreneurs, to civil society,

130
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
for people able to create the new,

131
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
not to the big, well-connected companies,

132
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
big, clunky government programs.

133
0:07:10.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And, after all this, as the great Chinese sage Lao Tzu said,

134
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
"Governing a great country is like cooking a small fish.

135
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Don't overdo it."

136
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And I think more and more people are also asking:

137
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Why boost consumption, rather than change what we consume?

138
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Like the mayor of São Paulo who's banned advertising billboards,

139
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
or the many cities like San Francisco

140
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
putting in infrastructures for electric cars.

141
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
You can see a bit of the same thing happening in the business world.

142
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Some, I think some of the bankers

143
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.

144
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
But ask yourselves: What will be the biggest sectors of the economy

145
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
in 10, 20, 30 years time? It won't be the ones lining up for handouts,

146
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
like cars and aerospace and so on.

147
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
The biggest sector, by far, will be health --

148
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
already 18 percent of the American economy,

149
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
predicted to grow to 30, even 40 percent by mid-century.

150
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Elder care, child care, already much bigger employers than cars.

151
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Education: six, seven, eight percent of the economy and growing.

152
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Environmental services, energy services, the myriad of green jobs,

153
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
they're all pointing to a very different kind of economy

154
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
which isn't just about products, but is using distributed networks,

155
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and it's founded above all on care, on relationships,

156
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
on what people do to other people, often one to one,

157
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
rather than simply selling them a product.

158
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And I think that what connects the challenge for civil society,

159
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
the challenge for governments and the challenge for business now

160
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
is, in a way, a very simple one, but quite a difficult one.

161
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We know our societies have to radically change.

162
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
We know we can't go back to where we were before the crisis.

163
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
But we also know it's only through experiment

164
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that we'll discover exactly how to run a low carbon city,

165
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
how to care for a much older population,

166
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
how to deal with drug addiction and so on.

167
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And here's the problem.

168
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
In science, we do experiments systematically.

169
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Our societies now spend two, three, four percent of GDP

170
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to invest systematically in new discovery, in science, in technology,

171
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to fuel the pipeline of brilliant inventions

172
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
which illuminate gatherings like this.

173
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter

174
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
than they were a hundred years ago, maybe they are,

175
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did.

176
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And what's striking though,

177
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
is that in society there's almost nothing comparable,

178
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
no comparable investment,

179
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
no systematic experiment, in the things capitalism isn't very good at,

180
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
like compassion, or empathy, or relationships or care.

181
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Now, I didn't really understand that until I met this guy

182
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
who was then an 80-year-old, slightly shambolic man

183
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
who lived on tomato soup and thought ironing was very overrated.

184
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
He had helped shape Britain's post-war institutions,

185
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
its welfare state, its economy,

186
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
but had sort of reinvented himself as a social entrepreneur,

187
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
became an inventor of many, many different organizations.

188
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Some famous ones like the Open University, which has 110,000 students,

189
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
the University of the Third Age, which has nearly half a million older people

190
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
teaching other older people,

191
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
as well as strange things like DIY garages and language lines

192
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and schools for social entrepreneurs.

193
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And he ended his life selling companies to venture capitalists.

194
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
He believed if you see a problem, you shouldn't tell someone to act,

195
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
you should act on it yourself, and he lived long enough

196
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed

197
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that he said you should always take no as a question and not as an answer.

198
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And his life was a systematic experiment to find better social answers,

199
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
not from a theory, but from experiment, and experiment involving the people

200
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
with the best intelligence on social needs,

201
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
which were usually the people living with those needs.

202
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And he believed we live with others, we share the world with others

203
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and therefore our innovation must be done with others too,

204
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
not doing things at people, for them, and so on.

205
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Now, what he did didn't used to have a name,

206
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
but I think it's rapidly becoming quite mainstream.

207
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
It's what we do in the organization named after him

208
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
where we try and invent, create, launch new ventures,

209
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
whether it's schools, web companies, health organizations and so on.

210
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement

211
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
of institutions working on social innovation,

212
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
using ideas from design or technology or community organizing

213
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to develop the germs of a future world, but through practice and through demonstration

214
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and not through theory.

215
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And they're spreading from Korea to Brazil to India to the USA

216
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and across Europe.

217
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And they've been given new momentum by the crisis, by the need for better answers

218
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
to joblessness, community breakdown and so on.

219
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Some of the ideas are strange.

220
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
These are complaints choirs.

221
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
People come together to sing about the things that really bug them.

222
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
(Laughter)

223
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Others are much more pragmatic: health coaches, learning mentors, job clubs.

224
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And some are quite structural, like social impact bonds

225
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
where you raise money to invest in diverting teenagers from crime

226
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
or helping old people keep out of hospital,

227
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are.

228
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Now, the idea that all of this represents,

229
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
I think, is rapidly becoming a common sense

230
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and part of how we respond to the crisis,

231
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
recognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress

232
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
as well as technological progress.

233
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
There were big health innovation funds

234
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
launched earlier this year in this country,

235
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
as well as a public service innovation lab.

236
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Across northern Europe, many governments

237
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
now have innovation laboratories within them.

238
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And just a few months ago, President Obama

239
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
launched the Office of Social Innovation in the White House.

240
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And what people are beginning to ask is:

241
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Surely, just as we invest in R and D, two, three, four percent,

242
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
of our GDP, of our economy,

243
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
what if we put, let's say, one percent of public spending

244
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
into social innovation, into elder care, new kinds of education,

245
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
new ways of helping the disabled?

246
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Perhaps we'd achieve similar productivity gains in society

247
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to those we've had in the economy and in technology.

248
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And if, a generation or two ago, the big challenges

249
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
were ones like getting a man on the moon,

250
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now

251
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
are ones like eliminating child malnutrition, stopping trafficking,

252
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
or one, I think closer to home for America or Europe,

253
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
why don't we set ourselves the goal

254
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
of achieving a billion extra years of life for today's citizens.

255
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Now those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade,

256
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
but only with radical and systematic experiment,

257
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
not just with technologies, but also with lifestyles and culture

258
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and policies and institutions too.

259
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Now, I want to end by saying a little bit about what I think this means for capitalism.

260
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
I think what this is all about, this whole movement

261
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
which is growing from the margins, remains quite small.

262
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Nothing like the resources of a CERN or a DARPA or an IBM or a Dupont.

263
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
What it's telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social.

264
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
It's already immersed in social networks.

265
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
It will become more involved in social investment, and social care

266
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and in industries where the value comes from what you do with others,

267
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
not just from what you sell to them,

268
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and from relationships as well as from consumption.

269
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
But interestingly too, it implies a future where society learns a few tricks from capitalism

270
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
about how you embed the DNA of restless continual innovation

271
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
into society, trying things out and then growing and scaling the ones that work.

272
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Now, I think this future will be quite surprising to many people.

273
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
In recent years, a lot of intelligent people thought that capitalism had basically won.

274
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
History was over

275
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy.

276
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
But I've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today

277
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and how they talked about the monarchy 200 years ago,

278
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
just after the French Revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in France.

279
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Then, people said monarchy dominated everywhere

280
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
because it was rooted in human nature.

281
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
We were naturally deferential. We needed hierarchy.

282
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Just as today, the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism

283
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
say it's rooted in human nature,

284
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
only now it's individualism, inquisitiveness, and so on.

285
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Then monarchy had seen off its big challenger, mass democracy,

286
0:15:47.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
which was seen as a well-intentioned but doomed experiment,

287
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:53,000
just as capitalism has seen off socialism.

288
0:15:53.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Even Fidel Castro now says that the only thing worse

289
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
than being exploited by multinational capitalism

290
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
is not being exploited by multinational capitalism.

291
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And whereas then monarchies, palaces and forts dominated every city skyline

292
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and looked permanent and confident,

293
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
today it's the gleaming towers of the banks which dominate every big city.

294
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
I'm not suggesting the crowds are about to storm the barricades

295
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and string up every investment banker from the nearest lamppost,

296
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
though that might be quite tempting.

297
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:25,000
But I do think we're on the verge of a period when,

298
0:16:25.33,000 --> 0:16:29,000
just as happened to the monarchy and, interestingly, the military too,

299
0:16:29.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
the central position of finance capital is going to come to an end,

300
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and it's going to steadily move to the sides, the margins of our society,

301
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:4,000
transformed from being a master into a servant,

302
0:16:40.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
a servant to the productive economy and of human needs.

303
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:46,000
And as that happens,

304
0:16:46.33,000 --> 0:16:49,000
we will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism,

305
0:16:49.33,000 --> 0:16:52,000
which is that, unlike what you read in economics textbooks,

306
0:16:52.33,000 --> 0:16:55,000
it's not a self-sufficient system.

307
0:16:55.33,000 --> 0:16:57,000
It depends on other systems,

308
0:16:57.33,000 --> 0:17:,000
on ecology, on family, on community,

309
0:17:00.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and if these aren't replenished, capitalism suffers too.

310
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:09,000
And our human nature isn't just selfish, it's also compassionate.

311
0:17:09.33,000 --> 0:17:13,000
It's not just competitive, it's also caring.

312
0:17:14.33,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Because of the depth of the crisis, I think we are at a moment of choice.

313
0:17:19.33,000 --> 0:17:22,000
The crisis is almost certainly deepening around us.

314
0:17:22.33,000 --> 0:17:24,000
It will be worse at the end of this year,

315
0:17:24.33,000 --> 0:17:27,000
quite possibly worse in a year's time than it is today.

316
0:17:27.33,000 --> 0:17:3,000
But this is one of those very rare moments

317
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:33,000
when we have to choose whether we're just pedaling furiously

318
0:17:33.33,000 --> 0:17:36,000
to get back to where we were a year or two ago,

319
0:17:36.33,000 --> 0:17:4,000
and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for,

320
0:17:40.33,000 --> 0:17:45,000
or whether this is a moment to jump ahead, to reboot

321
0:17:45.33,000 --> 0:17:48,000
and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway.

322
0:17:48.33,000 --> 0:17:5,000
Thank you.

323
0:17:50.33,000 --> 0:17:53,000

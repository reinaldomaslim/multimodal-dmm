1
0:00:12.58,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm Chetan Bhatt

2
0:00:13.86,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and when I give my name, I'm often asked, "Where are you from?"

3
0:00:17.9,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And I normally say London.

4
0:00:21.14,000 --> 0:00:22,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:22.66,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But of course, I know what they're really asking,

6
0:00:25.18,000 --> 0:00:27,000
so I say something like,

7
0:00:27.22,000 --> 0:00:3,000
"Well, my grandparents and my mum were born in India,

8
0:00:30.82,000 --> 0:00:32,000
my dad and I were born in Kenya,

9
0:00:33.5,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and I was brought up in London.

10
0:00:35.42,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And then they've got me mapped.

11
0:00:36.94,000 --> 0:00:38,000
"Ah, you're a Kenyan Asian. I've worked with one of those."

12
0:00:39.78,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:41.02,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And from my name they probably assume that I'm a Hindu.

14
0:00:44.42,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And this sort of fixes me for them.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But what about the Christians

16
0:00:50.3,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and the Muslims and the atheists

17
0:00:53.62,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that I grew up with?

18
0:00:55.14,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Or the socialists and the liberals,

19
0:00:57.66,000 --> 0:00:59,000
even the occasional Tory?

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:01.3,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Indeed, all kinds of women and men --

22
0:01:03.14,000 --> 0:01:05,000
vegetable sellers, factory workers, cooks, car mechanics --

23
0:01:06.1,000 --> 0:01:08,000
living in my working class area,

24
0:01:08.62,000 --> 0:01:1,000
in some profoundly important way,

25
0:01:11.18,000 --> 0:01:12,000
they are also a part of me

26
0:01:12.9,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and are here with me.

27
0:01:15.5,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Maybe that's why I find it hard to respond to questions about identity

28
0:01:20.02,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and about origin.

29
0:01:21.46,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And it's not just a sort of teenage refusal to be labeled.

30
0:01:25.74,000 --> 0:01:27,000
It's about our own most identities,

31
0:01:28.54,000 --> 0:01:3,000
the ones that we put our hands up to,

32
0:01:30.86,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the ones that we cheer for,

33
0:01:32.5,000 --> 0:01:33,000
the ones that we fight for,

34
0:01:34.22,000 --> 0:01:36,000
the ones that we love or hate.

35
0:01:37.06,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And it's about how we apprehend ourselves

36
0:01:40.18,000 --> 0:01:41,000
as well as others.

37
0:01:41.86,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And it's about identities we just assume that we have

38
0:01:44.54,000 --> 0:01:46,000
without thinking too much about them.

39
0:01:48.22,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But our responses to questions of identity and origin

40
0:01:51.98,000 --> 0:01:55,000
have substantial social and political importance.

41
0:01:57.46,000 --> 0:02:,000
We see the wars, the rages of identity going on all around us.

42
0:02:01.34,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We see violent religious, national and ethnic disputes.

43
0:02:05.82,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And often the conflict is based on old stories of identity

44
0:02:11.42,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and belonging

45
0:02:12.98,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and origins.

46
0:02:14.5,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And these identities are based on myths,

47
0:02:17.22,000 --> 0:02:2,000
typically about ancient, primordial origins.

48
0:02:20.94,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And these could be about Adam and Eve

49
0:02:23.38,000 --> 0:02:25,000
or about the supremacy of a caste or gender

50
0:02:26.34,000 --> 0:02:28,000
or about the vitality of a supposed race

51
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
or about the past glories of an empire or civilization

52
0:02:32.7,000 --> 0:02:33,000
or about a piece of land

53
0:02:34.42,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that some imagined deity has gifted.

54
0:02:38.62,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Now, people say

55
0:02:40.06,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that origin stories and identity myths make us feel secure.

56
0:02:44.18,000 --> 0:02:45,000
What's wrong with that?

57
0:02:45.5,000 --> 0:02:46,000
They give us a sense of belonging.

58
0:02:47.18,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Identity is your cultural clothing,

59
0:02:48.92,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and it can make you feel warm and fuzzy inside.

60
0:02:52.46,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But does it really?

61
0:02:54.18,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Do we really need identity myths to feel safe?

62
0:02:57.18,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Because I see religious, national, ethnic disputes

63
0:03:01.22,000 --> 0:03:03,000
as adding to human misery.

64
0:03:05.14,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Can I dare you

65
0:03:06.98,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to refuse every origin myth

66
0:03:10.94,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that claims you?

67
0:03:12.98,000 --> 0:03:15,000
What if we reject every single primordial origin myth

68
0:03:16.9,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and develop a deeper sense of personhood,

69
0:03:20.34,000 --> 0:03:22,000
one responsible to humanity as a whole

70
0:03:22.78,000 --> 0:03:24,000
rather than to a particular tribe,

71
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
a radically different idea of humanity

72
0:03:27.62,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that exposes how origin myths mystify,

73
0:03:32.62,000 --> 0:03:34,000
disguise global power,

74
0:03:34.98,000 --> 0:03:35,000
rapacious exploitation,

75
0:03:36.86,000 --> 0:03:39,000
poverty, the worldwide oppression of women and girls,

76
0:03:40.82,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and of course massive, accelerating inequalities?

77
0:03:46.46,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Now, origin myths are closely linked to tradition,

78
0:03:48.86,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and the word tradition points to something old

79
0:03:51.34,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and permanent, almost natural,

80
0:03:53.3,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and people assume tradition is just history,

81
0:03:56.06,000 --> 0:03:59,000
simply the past condensed into a nice story.

82
0:03:59.9,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But let's not confuse tradition with history.

83
0:04:02.78,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The two are often in severe conflict.

84
0:04:07.18,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Origin stories are usually recently created fictions of ancient belonging,

85
0:04:10.82,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and they're absurd

86
0:04:12.1,000 --> 0:04:13,000
given the complexity of humanity

87
0:04:13.78,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and our vastly interconnected, even if very unequal world.

88
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And today we see claims to tradition

89
0:04:21.86,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that claim to be ancient

90
0:04:23.38,000 --> 0:04:25,000
changing rapidly in front of our eyes.

91
0:04:28.82,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I was brought up in the 1970s near Wembley

92
0:04:30.899,000 --> 0:04:35,000
with Asian, English, Caribbean, Irish families living in our street,

93
0:04:35.94,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and the neo-Nazi National Front was massive then

94
0:04:39.06,000 --> 0:04:41,000
with regular marches and attacks on us

95
0:04:41.58,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and a permanent threat

96
0:04:42.82,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and often a frequent reality of violence against us

97
0:04:46.58,000 --> 0:04:48,000
on the streets, in our homes,

98
0:04:49.9,000 --> 0:04:51,000
typically by neo-Nazis and other racists.

99
0:04:52.18,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And I remember during a general election a leaflet came through our letter box

100
0:04:56.54,000 --> 0:04:59,000
with a picture of the National Front candidate for our area.

101
0:05:01.06,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And the picture

102
0:05:02.7,000 --> 0:05:03,000
was of our next-door neighbor.

103
0:05:05.02,000 --> 0:05:08,000
He threatened to shoot me once when I played in the garden as a kid,

104
0:05:08.94,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and many weekends, shaven-headed National Front activists

105
0:05:11.66,000 --> 0:05:12,000
arrived at his house

106
0:05:13.1,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and emerged with scores of placards

107
0:05:15.34,000 --> 0:05:18,000
screaming that they wanted us to go back home.

108
0:05:21.02,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But today he's one of my mum's best mates.

109
0:05:25.74,000 --> 0:05:28,000
He's a very lovely, gentle and kind man,

110
0:05:29.54,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and at some point in his political journey out of fascism

111
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
he embraced a broader idea of humanity.

112
0:05:37.94,000 --> 0:05:39,000
There was a Hindu family that we got to know well --

113
0:05:40.42,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and you have to understand that life in our street

114
0:05:42.82,000 --> 0:05:44,000
was a little bit like the setting for an Asian soap opera.

115
0:05:45.58,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Everyone knew everyone else's business,

116
0:05:47.5,000 --> 0:05:49,000
even if they didn't want it to be known by anyone at all.

117
0:05:50.22,000 --> 0:05:51,000
You really had no choice in this matter.

118
0:05:52.18,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But in this family, there was a quiet little boy

119
0:05:56.82,000 --> 0:05:57,000
who went to the same school as I did,

120
0:05:58.66,000 --> 0:06:,000
and after I left school, I didn't hear much more about him,

121
0:06:01.5,000 --> 0:06:03,000
except that he'd gone off to India.

122
0:06:06.58,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Now around 2000,

123
0:06:08.42,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I remember seeing this short book.

124
0:06:12.06,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The book was unusual

125
0:06:13.3,000 --> 0:06:16,000
because it was written by a British supporter of Al Qaeda,

126
0:06:17.06,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and in it the author calls for attacks in Britain.

127
0:06:20.14,000 --> 0:06:21,000
This is in 1999,

128
0:06:22.1,000 --> 0:06:26,000
so 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq was still in the future,

129
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and he helped scout New York bombing targets.

130
0:06:29.1,000 --> 0:06:33,000
He taught others how to make a dirty bomb to use on the London Underground,

131
0:06:33.94,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and he plotted a massive bombing campaign in London's shopping areas.

132
0:06:37.98,000 --> 0:06:4,000
He's a very high-risk security prisoner in the UK

133
0:06:41.1,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and one of the most important Al Qaeda figures to be arrested in Britain.

134
0:06:47.3,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The author of that book

135
0:06:49.18,000 --> 0:06:52,000
was the very same quiet little boy

136
0:06:52.66,000 --> 0:06:53,000
who went to my school.

137
0:06:54.98,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So a Hindu boy from Britain

138
0:06:57.14,000 --> 0:06:58,000
became an Al Qaeda fighter

139
0:06:58.9,000 --> 0:07:,000
and a most-wanted international terrorist,

140
0:07:00.98,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and he rejected what people would call his Hindu or Indian or British identity,

141
0:07:06.1,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and he became someone else.

142
0:07:07.98,000 --> 0:07:08,000
He refused to be who he was.

143
0:07:09.86,000 --> 0:07:11,000
He recreated himself,

144
0:07:12.18,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and this kind of journey is very common

145
0:07:14.5,000 --> 0:07:15,000
for young men and women

146
0:07:15.98,000 --> 0:07:18,000
who become involved in Al Qaeda or Islamic State

147
0:07:19.1,000 --> 0:07:22,000
or other transnational armed groups.

148
0:07:22.42,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Al Qaeda's media spokesman is a white American

149
0:07:26.3,000 --> 0:07:29,000
from a Jewish and Catholic mixed background,

150
0:07:29.78,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and neither he nor the boy from my school

151
0:07:32.58,000 --> 0:07:33,000
were from Muslim backgrounds.

152
0:07:34.3,000 --> 0:07:36,000
There's no point in asking them where are they from.

153
0:07:37.06,000 --> 0:07:39,000
A more important question is where they're going.

154
0:07:40.62,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And I would also put it to you

155
0:07:42.1,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that exactly the same journey occurs for those young men and women

156
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
who were brought up in Muslim family backgrounds.

157
0:07:48.22,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Most of those who join Al Qaeda

158
0:07:51.06,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and other Salafi jihadi groups from Europe, Asia, North America,

159
0:07:56.06,000 --> 0:07:57,000
even in many cases the Middle East

160
0:07:57.98,000 --> 0:08:,000
are those who have comprehensively rejected their backgrounds

161
0:08:01.94,000 --> 0:08:04,000
to become, in essence, new people.

162
0:08:06.1,000 --> 0:08:09,000
They spend an enormous amount of time attacking their parents' backgrounds

163
0:08:09.98,000 --> 0:08:12,000
as profane, impure, blasphemous,

164
0:08:13.02,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the wrong type of Islam,

165
0:08:15.34,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and their vision instead

166
0:08:16.86,000 --> 0:08:2,000
is a fantastical view of cosmic apocalypse.

167
0:08:21.46,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It's a born again vision.

168
0:08:22.82,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Discard your past, your society, your family and friends

169
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
since they're all impure.

170
0:08:29.66,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Instead, become someone else,

171
0:08:33.06,000 --> 0:08:34,000
your true self,

172
0:08:35.3,000 --> 0:08:37,000
your authentic self.

173
0:08:38.82,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Now, this isn't about a return to the past.

174
0:08:42.9,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It's about using a forgery of the past

175
0:08:46.14,000 --> 0:08:5,000
to envision an appalling future which begins today at year zero.

176
0:08:50.66,000 --> 0:08:53,000
This is why over 80 percent of the victims of Al Qaeda and Islamic State

177
0:08:54.18,000 --> 0:08:55,000
are people from Muslim backgrounds.

178
0:08:55.9,000 --> 0:08:59,000
The first act by Salafi jihadi groups when they take over an area

179
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
is to destroy existing Muslim institutions

180
0:09:03.38,000 --> 0:09:06,000
including mosques, shrines, preachers, practices.

181
0:09:08.3,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Their main purpose is to control and punish people internally,

182
0:09:11.74,000 --> 0:09:13,000
to dictate the spaces that women may go,

183
0:09:14.46,000 --> 0:09:16,000
their clothing, family relations,

184
0:09:16.62,000 --> 0:09:2,000
beliefs, even the minute detail of how one prays.

185
0:09:20.94,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And you get the impression in the news

186
0:09:23.06,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that they are after us in the West,

187
0:09:26.34,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but they are actually mainly after people from other Muslim backgrounds.

188
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
In their view, no other Muslim can ever be pure enough,

189
0:09:37.18,000 --> 0:09:4,000
so ordinary beliefs and practices that have existed for centuries

190
0:09:40.3,000 --> 0:09:41,000
are attacked as impure

191
0:09:42.3,000 --> 0:09:45,000
by teenagers from Birmingham or London

192
0:09:45.5,000 --> 0:09:46,000
who know nothing

193
0:09:48.14,000 --> 0:09:53,000
about the histories that they so joyously obliterate.

194
0:09:54.62,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Now here, their claim to tradition is at war with history,

195
0:09:59.5,000 --> 0:10:02,000
but they're nevertheless very certain about their purity

196
0:10:02.58,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and about the impurity of others.

197
0:10:06.34,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Purity,

198
0:10:08.46,000 --> 0:10:09,000
certainty,

199
0:10:10.1,000 --> 0:10:11,000
the return to authentic tradition,

200
0:10:11.86,000 --> 0:10:14,000
the quest for these can lead to lethal visions

201
0:10:15.18,000 --> 0:10:19,000
of perfect societies and perfected people.

202
0:10:19.22,000 --> 0:10:23,000
This is what the main Hindu fundamentalist organization in India

203
0:10:23.5,000 --> 0:10:25,000
looks like today at its mass rally.

204
0:10:26.58,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Maybe it reminds you of the 1930s in Italy or Germany,

205
0:10:29.9,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and the movement's roots are indeed in fascism.

206
0:10:32.14,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It was a member of the same Hindu fundamentalist movement

207
0:10:35.9,000 --> 0:10:37,000
who shot dead Mahatma Gandhi.

208
0:10:39.98,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Hindu fundamentalists today view this murderer as a national hero,

209
0:10:45.02,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and they want to put up statues of him throughout India.

210
0:10:48.86,000 --> 0:10:49,000
They've been involved for decades

211
0:10:50.5,000 --> 0:10:52,000
in large-scale mass violence against minorities.

212
0:10:53.06,000 --> 0:10:55,000
They ban books, art, films.

213
0:10:55.7,000 --> 0:10:57,000
They attack romantic couples on Valentine's Day,

214
0:10:57.98,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Christians on Christmas Day.

215
0:11:00.06,000 --> 0:11:02,000
They don't like others talking critically

216
0:11:02.98,000 --> 0:11:04,000
about what they see as their ancient culture

217
0:11:05.62,000 --> 0:11:06,000
or using its images

218
0:11:07.14,000 --> 0:11:08,000
or caricaturing it

219
0:11:08.78,000 --> 0:11:1,000
or drawing cartoons about it.

220
0:11:12.5,000 --> 0:11:15,000
But the people making the strongest possible claims

221
0:11:16.02,000 --> 0:11:18,000
about ancient, timeless Hindu religion

222
0:11:18.94,000 --> 0:11:2,000
are dressed in brown shorts and white shirts

223
0:11:21.58,000 --> 0:11:23,000
while claiming, oddly,

224
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
to be the original Aryan race,

225
0:11:27.14,000 --> 0:11:29,000
just like the violent Salafi jihadis

226
0:11:29.58,000 --> 0:11:31,000
who make their claims about their primordial religion

227
0:11:32.58,000 --> 0:11:34,000
while dressed in black military uniforms

228
0:11:35.06,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and wearing balaclavas.

229
0:11:37.78,000 --> 0:11:41,000
These people are manufacturing pure, pristine identities of conviction

230
0:11:42.18,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and of certainty.

231
0:11:43.42,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Fundamentalists see religion and culture as their sole property, a property.

232
0:11:48.82,000 --> 0:11:5,000
But religions and cultures are processes.

233
0:11:51.42,000 --> 0:11:54,000
They're not things. They're impermanent. They're messy. They're impure.

234
0:11:54.82,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Look at any religion and you'll see disputes and arguments

235
0:11:57.58,000 --> 0:11:59,000
going all the way down.

236
0:12:01.46,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Any criticism of religion in any form

237
0:12:05.18,000 --> 0:12:06,000
has to therefore be

238
0:12:07.14,000 --> 0:12:09,000
part of the expansive sense of humanity

239
0:12:09.74,000 --> 0:12:1,000
we should aspire to.

240
0:12:12.22,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I respect your right to have and to express your religion

241
0:12:16.7,000 --> 0:12:18,000
or your culture or your opinion,

242
0:12:19.34,000 --> 0:12:21,000
but I don't necessarily have to respect the content.

243
0:12:22.22,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I might like some of it.

244
0:12:23.5,000 --> 0:12:25,000
I might like how an old church looks, for example,

245
0:12:26.34,000 --> 0:12:27,000
but this isn't the same thing.

246
0:12:28.78,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Similarly, I have a human right

247
0:12:31.42,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to say something that you may find offensive,

248
0:12:33.58,000 --> 0:12:35,000
but you do not have a human right not to be offended.

249
0:12:36.9,000 --> 0:12:38,000
In a genuine democracy, we're constantly offended

250
0:12:39.86,000 --> 0:12:41,000
since people express different views all the time.

251
0:12:42.66,000 --> 0:12:43,000
They also change their views,

252
0:12:45.18,000 --> 0:12:46,000
so their views are impermanent.

253
0:12:46.74,000 --> 0:12:49,000
You cannot fix someone's political views

254
0:12:50.06,000 --> 0:12:53,000
based on their religious or national or cultural background.

255
0:12:54.66,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Now, these points about religious purity

256
0:12:57.5,000 --> 0:13:,000
also apply to nationalism and to racism.

257
0:13:02.98,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I'm always puzzled

258
0:13:05.5,000 --> 0:13:09,000
to have pride in your national or ethnic identity,

259
0:13:11.74,000 --> 0:13:14,000
pride in the accident of birth from a warm and cozy womb,

260
0:13:16.38,000 --> 0:13:19,000
belief in your superiority because of the accident of birth.

261
0:13:21.1,000 --> 0:13:23,000
These people have very firm ideas

262
0:13:23.38,000 --> 0:13:25,000
about what belongs and what doesn't belong

263
0:13:25.404,000 --> 0:13:28,000
inside the cozy national cultures that they imagine.

264
0:13:29.1,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And I'm going to caricature a bit here, but only a little bit.

265
0:13:32.94,000 --> 0:13:35,000
I want you to imagine the supporter of some Little Englander

266
0:13:36.22,000 --> 0:13:37,000
or British nationalist political party,

267
0:13:38.14,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and he's sitting at home

268
0:13:39.54,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and he's screaming about foreigners

269
0:13:42.42,000 --> 0:13:43,000
invading his country

270
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
while watching Fox News,

271
0:13:46.22,000 --> 0:13:48,000
an American cable channel

272
0:13:48.42,000 --> 0:13:49,000
owned by an Australian

273
0:13:49.9,000 --> 0:13:51,000
on his South Korean television set

274
0:13:52.06,000 --> 0:13:55,000
which was bought by his Spanish credit card

275
0:13:55.66,000 --> 0:13:58,000
which is paid off monthly by his high-street British bank

276
0:13:58.94,000 --> 0:14:,000
which has its headquarters in Hong Kong.

277
0:14:02.18,000 --> 0:14:06,000
He supports a British football team owned by a Russian.

278
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
His favorite brand of fish and chips

279
0:14:08.02,000 --> 0:14:1,000
is owned by a Swedish venture capitalist firm.

280
0:14:10.7,000 --> 0:14:11,000
The church he sometimes goes to

281
0:14:12.22,000 --> 0:14:15,000
has its creed decided in meetings in Ghana.

282
0:14:17.1,000 --> 0:14:19,000
His Union Jack underpants

283
0:14:20.14,000 --> 0:14:21,000
were made in India.

284
0:14:21.38,000 --> 0:14:23,000
(Laughter)

285
0:14:23.66,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And --

286
0:14:24.9,000 --> 0:14:29,000
(Applause)

287
0:14:30.86,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Thank you.

288
0:14:32.1,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And they're laundered regularly

289
0:14:36.06,000 --> 0:14:38,000
by a very nice Polish lady.

290
0:14:38.86,000 --> 0:14:39,000
(Laughter)

291
0:14:41.06,000 --> 0:14:43,000
There is no pure ethnicity, national culture,

292
0:14:43.86,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and the ethical choices we have today

293
0:14:45.98,000 --> 0:14:48,000
are far wider than being forced to choose

294
0:14:49.98,000 --> 0:14:52,000
between racist right and religious right visions,

295
0:14:53.46,000 --> 0:14:55,000
dismal visions of culture.

296
0:14:56.78,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Now, culture isn't just about language, food, clothing and music,

297
0:15:00.54,000 --> 0:15:02,000
but gender relations, ancient monuments,

298
0:15:02.86,000 --> 0:15:04,000
a heritage of sacred texts.

299
0:15:06.7,000 --> 0:15:1,000
But culture can also be what has been decided to be culture

300
0:15:10.74,000 --> 0:15:12,000
by those who have a political stake

301
0:15:13.54,000 --> 0:15:16,000
in pounding culture into the shape of a prison.

302
0:15:18.02,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Big political identity claims are elite bids for power.

303
0:15:21.1,000 --> 0:15:25,000
They're not answers to social or economic or political injustices.

304
0:15:25.22,000 --> 0:15:26,000
They often obscure them.

305
0:15:27.38,000 --> 0:15:29,000
And what about the large number of people across the globe

306
0:15:30.14,000 --> 0:15:32,000
who can't point to a monument from their past,

307
0:15:32.34,000 --> 0:15:34,000
who don't possess a sacred written text,

308
0:15:34.7,000 --> 0:15:36,000
who can't hark back

309
0:15:36.78,000 --> 0:15:39,000
to the past glories of a civilization or empire?

310
0:15:40.5,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Are these people less a part of humanity?

311
0:15:46.38,000 --> 0:15:47,000
What about you,

312
0:15:47.98,000 --> 0:15:48,000
now, listening to this?

313
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
What about you and your identity,

314
0:15:50.94,000 --> 0:15:55,000
because you stitch your experiences and your thoughts into a continuous person

315
0:15:56.34,000 --> 0:15:58,000
moving forward in time.

316
0:15:58.46,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And this is what you are when you say,

317
0:16:00.34,000 --> 0:16:02,000
"I," "am," or "me."

318
0:16:03.42,000 --> 0:16:06,000
But this also includes all of your hopes and dreams,

319
0:16:06.58,000 --> 0:16:08,000
all of the you's that could have been,

320
0:16:09.1,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and it includes all the other people

321
0:16:11.46,000 --> 0:16:14,000
and the things that are in the biography of who you are.

322
0:16:14.74,000 --> 0:16:16,000
They, the others,

323
0:16:16.78,000 --> 0:16:17,000
are also a part of you,

324
0:16:18.58,000 --> 0:16:19,000
moving forward with you.

325
0:16:21.9,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Your authentic self, if such a thing exists,

326
0:16:25.34,000 --> 0:16:28,000
is a complex, messy and uncertain self,

327
0:16:28.5,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and that is a very good thing.

328
0:16:33.9,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Why not value those impurities and uncertainties?

329
0:16:36.3,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Maybe clinging to pure identities is a sign of immaturity,

330
0:16:40.14,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and ethnic, nationalist and religious traditions are bad for you.

331
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Why not be skeptical about every primordial origin claim

332
0:16:46.14,000 --> 0:16:47,000
made on your behalf?

333
0:16:47.62,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Why not reject the identity myths that call on you to belong,

334
0:16:53.74,000 --> 0:16:55,000
that politicians and community leaders,

335
0:16:56.38,000 --> 0:16:57,000
so-called community leaders,

336
0:16:58.22,000 --> 0:16:59,000
place on you?

337
0:16:59.5,000 --> 0:17:01,000
If we don't need origin stories and fixed identities,

338
0:17:02.18,000 --> 0:17:05,000
we can challenge ourselves to think creatively

339
0:17:05.5,000 --> 0:17:07,000
about each other and our future.

340
0:17:08.1,000 --> 0:17:1,000
And here culture always takes care of itself.

341
0:17:11.06,000 --> 0:17:12,000
I'm not worried about culture.

342
0:17:12.54,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Cultures are creative, dynamic processes,

343
0:17:15.98,000 --> 0:17:18,000
not imposed laws and boundaries.

344
0:17:19.78,000 --> 0:17:22,000
This is Abu al-Walid Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Rushd,

345
0:17:23.46,000 --> 0:17:26,000
a very senior Muslim judge and thinker in Cordoba in the 12th century,

346
0:17:27.419,000 --> 0:17:31,000
and his writings were considered deeply blasphemous, heretical and evil.

347
0:17:31.58,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Long after he died,

348
0:17:32.98,000 --> 0:17:34,000
followers of his work were ruthlessly hunted down,

349
0:17:35.38,000 --> 0:17:37,000
banished and killed over several centuries

350
0:17:38.139,000 --> 0:17:42,000
by the most powerful religious institution of the medieval period.

351
0:17:43.7,000 --> 0:17:46,000
That institution was the Roman Catholic Church.

352
0:17:48.58,000 --> 0:17:49,000
Why?

353
0:17:50.1,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Because ibn Rushd said that something true in religion

354
0:17:52.86,000 --> 0:17:53,000
may conflict with something

355
0:17:54.22,000 --> 0:17:57,000
that your reason finds to be true on earth,

356
0:17:58.22,000 --> 0:18:,000
but the latter is still true.

357
0:18:01.46,000 --> 0:18:02,000
There are two distinct worlds of truth,

358
0:18:03.38,000 --> 0:18:05,000
one based on our reason and evidence, and one that is divine,

359
0:18:06.3,000 --> 0:18:1,000
and the state, political power, social law are in the realm of reason.

360
0:18:11.22,000 --> 0:18:12,000
Religious life is a different realm.

361
0:18:13.18,000 --> 0:18:14,000
They should be kept separated.

362
0:18:14.94,000 --> 0:18:17,000
Social and political life should be governed by our reason,

363
0:18:18.54,000 --> 0:18:19,000
not by religion.

364
0:18:20.02,000 --> 0:18:22,000
And you can see why the church was upset by his writings,

365
0:18:22.74,000 --> 0:18:24,000
as indeed were some Muslims during his lifetime,

366
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
because he gives us a strong statement of secularism

367
0:18:29.86,000 --> 0:18:31,000
of a kind which is normal in Europe today.

368
0:18:32.66,000 --> 0:18:33,000
Now, history plays many tricks on us.

369
0:18:34.5,000 --> 0:18:35,000
It undermines our fixed truths

370
0:18:36.22,000 --> 0:18:38,000
and what we believe to be our culture and their culture.

371
0:18:39.06,000 --> 0:18:41,000
Ibn Rushd, someone who happens to be a Muslim,

372
0:18:41.54,000 --> 0:18:42,000
is considered one of the key influences

373
0:18:43.5,000 --> 0:18:46,000
in the introduction and spread of secularism in Europe.

374
0:18:47.82,000 --> 0:18:51,000
So against religious, nationalist and racial purists of all kinds,

375
0:18:52.06,000 --> 0:18:56,000
can you make his story a part of your own,

376
0:18:56.3,000 --> 0:18:57,000
not because he happened to be a Muslim,

377
0:18:58.22,000 --> 0:18:59,000
not because he happened to be an Arab,

378
0:19:00.22,000 --> 0:19:01,000
but because he was a human being

379
0:19:02.74,000 --> 0:19:03,000
with some very good ideas

380
0:19:04.62,000 --> 0:19:05,000
that shook his world

381
0:19:06.74,000 --> 0:19:07,000
and ours.

382
0:19:08.62,000 --> 0:19:09,000
Thank you.

383
0:19:09.86,000 --> 0:19:13,000
(Applause)

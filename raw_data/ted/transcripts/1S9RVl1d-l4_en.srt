1
0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:13,000
"We're declaring war against cancer,

2
0:00:14.76,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and we will win this war by 2015."

3
0:00:18.44,000 --> 0:00:21,000
This is what the US Congress and the National Cancer Institute declared

4
0:00:22.2,000 --> 0:00:24,000
just a few years ago, in 2003.

5
0:00:25.56,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Now, I don't know about you, but I don't buy that.

6
0:00:28.68,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I don't think we quite won this war yet,

7
0:00:30.76,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and I don't think anyone here will question that.

8
0:00:33.8,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Now, I will argue that a primary reason

9
0:00:36.32,000 --> 0:00:38,000
why we're not winning this war against cancer

10
0:00:38.48,000 --> 0:00:4,000
is because we're fighting blindly.

11
0:00:40.8,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I'm going to start by sharing with you a story about a good friend of mine.

12
0:00:44.4,000 --> 0:00:45,000
His name is Ehud,

13
0:00:45.64,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and a few years ago, Ehud was diagnosed with brain cancer.

14
0:00:48.8,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And not just any type of brain cancer:

15
0:00:50.68,000 --> 0:00:53,000
he was diagnosed with one of the most deadly forms of brain cancer.

16
0:00:53.88,000 --> 0:00:54,000
In fact, it was so deadly

17
0:00:55.12,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that the doctors told him that they only have 12 months,

18
0:00:57.8,000 --> 0:01:,000
and during those 12 months, they have to find a treatment.

19
0:01:01.24,000 --> 0:01:02,000
They have to find a cure,

20
0:01:02.72,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and if they cannot find a cure, he will die.

21
0:01:05.8,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Now, the good news, they said,

22
0:01:07.28,000 --> 0:01:09,000
is that there are tons of different treatments to choose from,

23
0:01:10.24,000 --> 0:01:11,000
but the bad news is

24
0:01:11.48,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that in order for them to tell if a treatment is even working or not,

25
0:01:15.04,000 --> 0:01:17,000
well, that takes them about three months or so.

26
0:01:17.56,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So they cannot try that many things.

27
0:01:19.96,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Well, Ehud is now going into his first treatment,

28
0:01:23.08,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and during that first treatment, just a few days into that treatment,

29
0:01:26.36,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I'm meeting with him, and he tells me, "Adam, I think this is working.

30
0:01:29.72,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I think we really lucked out here. Something is happening."

31
0:01:32.56,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And I ask him, "Really? How do you know that, Ehud?"

32
0:01:35.04,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And he says, "Well, I feel so terrible inside.

33
0:01:37.28,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Something's gotta be working up there.

34
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
It just has to."

35
0:01:40.4,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Well, unfortunately, three months later, we got the news, it didn't work.

36
0:01:45.52,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And so Ehud goes into his second treatment.

37
0:01:47.6,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And again, the same story.

38
0:01:48.88,000 --> 0:01:5,000
"It feels so bad, something's gotta be working there."

39
0:01:51.64,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And then three months later, again we get bad news.

40
0:01:54.6,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Ehud is going into his third treatment, and then his fourth treatment.

41
0:01:58.56,000 --> 0:02:,000
And then, as predicted, Ehud dies.

42
0:02:01.8,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Now, when someone really close to you is going through such a huge struggle,

43
0:02:06.4,000 --> 0:02:07,000
you get really swamped with emotions.

44
0:02:08.24,000 --> 0:02:1,000
A lot of things are going through your head.

45
0:02:10.36,000 --> 0:02:11,000
For me, it was mostly outrage.

46
0:02:11.84,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I was just outraged that, how come this is the best that we can offer?

47
0:02:16.56,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And I started looking more and more into this.

48
0:02:18.88,000 --> 0:02:21,000
As it turns out, this is not just the best that doctors could offer Ehud.

49
0:02:22.36,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It's not just the best doctors could offer patients with brain cancer generally.

50
0:02:26.2,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We're actually not doing that well all across the board with cancer.

51
0:02:30.24,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I picked up one of those statistics,

52
0:02:32.12,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and I'm sure some of you have seen those statistics before.

53
0:02:34.92,000 --> 0:02:37,000
This is going to show you here how many patients actually died of cancer,

54
0:02:38.4,000 --> 0:02:4,000
in this case females in the United States,

55
0:02:40.44,000 --> 0:02:41,000
ever since the 1930s.

56
0:02:41.76,000 --> 0:02:44,000
You'll notice that there aren't that many things that have changed.

57
0:02:44.96,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It's still a huge issue.

58
0:02:46.28,000 --> 0:02:47,000
You'll see a few changes, though.

59
0:02:48.04,000 --> 0:02:5,000
You'll see lung cancer, for example, on the rise.

60
0:02:50.6,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Thank you, cigarettes.

61
0:02:52.36,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And you'll also see that, for example, stomach cancer

62
0:02:54.88,000 --> 0:02:57,000
once used to be one of the biggest killers of all cancers,

63
0:02:58.24,000 --> 0:02:59,000
is essentially eliminated.

64
0:03:00.48,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Now, why is that? Anyone knows, by the way?

65
0:03:02.56,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Why is it that humanity is no longer struck by stomach cancer?

66
0:03:05.92,000 --> 0:03:09,000
What was the huge, huge medical technology breakthrough

67
0:03:10.8,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that came to our world that saved humanity from stomach cancer?

68
0:03:15.24,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Was it maybe a new drug, or a better diagnostic?

69
0:03:19.08,000 --> 0:03:2,000
You guys are right, yeah.

70
0:03:20.4,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It's the invention of the refrigerator,

71
0:03:23.04,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and the fact that we're no longer eating spoiled meats.

72
0:03:25.68,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So the best thing that happened to us so far

73
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:29,000
in the medical arena in cancer research

74
0:03:29.96,000 --> 0:03:31,000
is the fact that the refrigerator was invented.

75
0:03:32.175,000 --> 0:03:33,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:33.4,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And so -- yeah, I know.

77
0:03:34.68,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We're not doing so well here.

78
0:03:36.12,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I don't want to miniaturize the progress

79
0:03:38.48,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and everything that's been done in cancer research.

80
0:03:41.88,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Look, there is like 50-plus years of good cancer research

81
0:03:45.32,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that discovered major, major things that taught us about cancer.

82
0:03:48.76,000 --> 0:03:49,000
But all that said,

83
0:03:50.52,000 --> 0:03:52,000
we have a lot of heavy lifting to still do ahead of us.

84
0:03:54.92,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Again, I will argue that the primary reason why this is the case,

85
0:03:58.04,000 --> 0:04:,000
why we have not done that remarkably well,

86
0:04:00.064,000 --> 0:04:01,000
is really we're fighting blindly here.

87
0:04:01.92,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And this is where medical imaging comes in.

88
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
This is where my own work comes in.

89
0:04:06.4,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And so to give you a sense of the best medical imaging

90
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that's offered today to brain cancer patients,

91
0:04:11.68,000 --> 0:04:13,000
or actually generally to all cancer patients,

92
0:04:13.88,000 --> 0:04:14,000
take a look at this PET scan right here.

93
0:04:15.84,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Let's see. There we go.

94
0:04:17.64,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So this is a PET/CT scan,

95
0:04:19.36,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and what you'll see in this PET/CT scan

96
0:04:21.84,000 --> 0:04:24,000
is the CT scan will show you where the bones are,

97
0:04:25.08,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and the PET scan will show you where tumors are.

98
0:04:27.96,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Now, what you can see here

99
0:04:30.2,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is essentially a sugar molecule

100
0:04:32.64,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that was added a small little tag

101
0:04:34.48,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that is signaling to us outside of the body,

102
0:04:36.6,000 --> 0:04:37,000
"Hey, I'm here."

103
0:04:37.92,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And those sugar molecules are injected into these patients by the billions,

104
0:04:41.76,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and they're going all over the body

105
0:04:43.48,000 --> 0:04:45,000
looking for cells that are hungry for sugar.

106
0:04:46.32,000 --> 0:04:48,000
You'll see that the heart, for example, lights up there.

107
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:51,000
That's because the heart needs a lot of sugar.

108
0:04:51.24,000 --> 0:04:53,000
You'll also see that the bladder lights up there.

109
0:04:53.6,000 --> 0:04:55,000
That's because the bladder is the thing that's clearing

110
0:04:56.24,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the sugar away from our body.

111
0:04:58.096,000 --> 0:05:,000
And then you'll see a few other hot spots,

112
0:05:00.12,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and these are in fact the tumors.

113
0:05:01.76,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Now, this is a really a wonderful technology.

114
0:05:03.92,000 --> 0:05:06,000
For the first time it allowed us to look into someone's body

115
0:05:07.08,000 --> 0:05:09,000
without picking up each and every one of the cells

116
0:05:09.48,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and putting them under the microscope,

117
0:05:11.36,000 --> 0:05:14,000
but in a noninvasive way allowing us to look into someone's body

118
0:05:14.4,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and ask, "Hey, has the cancer metastasized?

119
0:05:16.56,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Where is it?"

120
0:05:17.8,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And the PET scans here are showing you very clearly

121
0:05:20.32,000 --> 0:05:22,000
where are these hot spots, where is the tumor.

122
0:05:23.48,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So as miraculous as this might seem,

123
0:05:26.8,000 --> 0:05:28,000
unfortunately, well, it's not that great.

124
0:05:30.32,000 --> 0:05:32,000
You see, those small little hot spots there.

125
0:05:33.24,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Can anyone guess how many cancer cells are in any one of these tumors?

126
0:05:38.6,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So it's about 100 million cancer cells,

127
0:05:40.96,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and let me make sure that this number sunk in.

128
0:05:43.68,000 --> 0:05:45,000
In each and every one of these small little blips

129
0:05:46.04,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that you're seeing on the image,

130
0:05:47.64,000 --> 0:05:51,000
there needs to be at least 100 million cancer cells

131
0:05:51.76,000 --> 0:05:52,000
in order for it to be detected.

132
0:05:53.32,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Now, if that seemed to you like a very large number,

133
0:05:55.8,000 --> 0:05:56,000
it is a very large number.

134
0:05:58.64,000 --> 0:06:,000
This is in fact an incredibly large number,

135
0:06:00.72,000 --> 0:06:03,000
because what we really need in order to pick up something early enough

136
0:06:04.08,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to do something about it, to do something meaningful about it,

137
0:06:07.04,000 --> 0:06:1,000
well, we need to pick up tumors that are a thousand cells in size,

138
0:06:10.2,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and ideally just a handful of cells in size.

139
0:06:12.36,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So we're clearly pretty far away from this.

140
0:06:14.4,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So we're going to play a little experiment here.

141
0:06:16.68,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I'm going to ask each of you to now play and imagine

142
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that you are brain surgeons.

143
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And you guys are now at an operating room,

144
0:06:25.04,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and there's a patient in front of you,

145
0:06:27.08,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and your task is to make sure that the tumor is out.

146
0:06:31.4,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So you're looking down at the patient,

147
0:06:34.8,000 --> 0:06:36,000
the skin and the skull have already been removed,

148
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
so you're looking at the brain.

149
0:06:38.72,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And all you know about this patient

150
0:06:40.44,000 --> 0:06:42,000
is that there's a tumor about the size of a golf ball or so

151
0:06:43.28,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in the right frontal lobe of this person's brain.

152
0:06:46.08,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And that's more or less it.

153
0:06:47.44,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So you're looking down, and unfortunately everything looks the same,

154
0:06:50.68,000 --> 0:06:53,000
because brain cancer tissue and healthy brain tissue

155
0:06:53.8,000 --> 0:06:54,000
really just look the same.

156
0:06:55.4,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And so you're going in with your thumb,

157
0:06:57.32,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and you start to press a little bit on the brain,

158
0:06:59.68,000 --> 0:07:01,000
because tumors tend to be a little harder, stiffer,

159
0:07:02.12,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and so you go in and go a little bit like this and say,

160
0:07:04.76,000 --> 0:07:05,000
"It seems like the tumor is right there."

161
0:07:06.76,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Then you take out your knife and start cutting the tumor

162
0:07:09.44,000 --> 0:07:1,000
piece by piece by piece.

163
0:07:10.72,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And as you're taking the tumor out,

164
0:07:12.44,000 --> 0:07:14,000
then you're getting to a stage where you think,

165
0:07:14.68,000 --> 0:07:16,000
"Alright, I'm done. I took out everything."

166
0:07:16.84,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And at this stage, if that's --

167
0:07:18.4,000 --> 0:07:2,000
so far everything sounded, like, pretty crazy --

168
0:07:21.12,000 --> 0:07:24,000
you're now about to face the most challenging decision of your life here.

169
0:07:24.84,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Because now you need to decide,

170
0:07:26.4,000 --> 0:07:28,000
should I stop here and let this patient go,

171
0:07:29.12,000 --> 0:07:31,000
risking that there might be some leftover cancer cells behind

172
0:07:32.08,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that I just couldn't see,

173
0:07:33.96,000 --> 0:07:35,000
or should I take away some extra margins,

174
0:07:36.64,000 --> 0:07:38,000
typically about an inch or so around the tumor

175
0:07:39.52,000 --> 0:07:41,000
just to be sure that I removed everything?

176
0:07:43.4,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So this is not a simple decision to make,

177
0:07:47.84,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and unfortunately this is the decision

178
0:07:49.8,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that brain cancer surgeons have to take every single day

179
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
as they're seeing their patients.

180
0:07:55.32,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And so I remember talking to a few friends of mine in the lab,

181
0:07:58.28,000 --> 0:08:,000
and we say, "Boy, there's got to be a better way."

182
0:08:00.68,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But not just like you tell a friend that there's got to be a better way.

183
0:08:04.12,000 --> 0:08:05,000
There's just got to be a better way here.

184
0:08:06.097,000 --> 0:08:07,000
This is just incredible.

185
0:08:07.64,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And so we looked back.

186
0:08:09.32,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Remember those PET scans I told you about, the sugar and so on.

187
0:08:12.32,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We said, hey, how about instead of using sugar molecules,

188
0:08:15.08,000 --> 0:08:18,000
let's maybe take tiny, tiny little particles made of gold,

189
0:08:18.24,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and let's program them with some interesting chemistry around them.

190
0:08:21.92,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Let's program them to look for cancer cells.

191
0:08:24.36,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And then we will inject these gold particles

192
0:08:26.48,000 --> 0:08:28,000
into these patients by the billions again,

193
0:08:28.76,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and we'll have them go all over the body,

194
0:08:30.76,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and just like secret agents, if you will,

195
0:08:32.76,000 --> 0:08:34,000
go and walk by every single cell in our body

196
0:08:35.6,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and knock on the door of that cell,

197
0:08:37.32,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and ask, "Are you a cancer cell or are you a healthy cell?

198
0:08:40.08,000 --> 0:08:42,000
If you're a healthy cell, we're moving on.

199
0:08:42.12,000 --> 0:08:44,000
If you're a cancer cell, we're sticking in and shining out

200
0:08:44.88,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and telling us, "Hey, look at me, I'm here."

201
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And they'll do it through some interesting cameras

202
0:08:49.4,000 --> 0:08:5,000
that we developed in the lab.

203
0:08:50.84,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And once we see that, maybe we can guide brain cancer surgeons

204
0:08:53.799,000 --> 0:08:56,000
towards taking only the tumor and leaving the healthy brain alone.

205
0:08:57.72,000 --> 0:09:,000
And so we've tested that, and boy, this works well.

206
0:09:00.8,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So I'm going to show you an example now.

207
0:09:02.8,000 --> 0:09:03,000
What you're looking at here

208
0:09:04.6,000 --> 0:09:07,000
is an image of a mouse's brain,

209
0:09:08.56,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and we've implanted into this mouse's brain

210
0:09:11.72,000 --> 0:09:12,000
a small little tumor.

211
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And so this tumor is now growing in this mouse's brain,

212
0:09:15.64,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and then we've taken a doctor and asked the doctor

213
0:09:18.32,000 --> 0:09:2,000
to please operate on the mouse as if that was a patient,

214
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and take out piece by piece out of the tumor.

215
0:09:23.6,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And while he's doing that,

216
0:09:25.4,000 --> 0:09:27,000
we're going to take images to see where the gold particles are.

217
0:09:28.4,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And so we're going to first start

218
0:09:30.04,000 --> 0:09:32,000
by injecting these gold particles into this mouse,

219
0:09:32.48,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and we're going to see right here at the very left there

220
0:09:35.4,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that image at the bottom

221
0:09:36.68,000 --> 0:09:38,000
is the image that shows where the gold particles are.

222
0:09:39.2,000 --> 0:09:41,000
The nice thing is that these gold particles

223
0:09:41.28,000 --> 0:09:43,000
actually made it all the way to the tumor,

224
0:09:43.32,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and then they shine out and tell us, "Hey, we're here. Here's the tumor."

225
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So now we can see the tumor,

226
0:09:48.4,000 --> 0:09:5,000
but we're not showing this to the doctor yet.

227
0:09:50.56,000 --> 0:09:53,000
We're asking the doctor, now please start cutting away the tumor,

228
0:09:53.64,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and you'll see here the doctor just took the first quadrant of the tumor

229
0:09:57.08,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and you see that first quadrant is now missing.

230
0:09:59.32,000 --> 0:10:01,000
The doctor then took the second quadrant, the third,

231
0:10:01.8,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and now it appears to be everything.

232
0:10:03.56,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And so at this stage, the doctor came back to us and said,

233
0:10:06.32,000 --> 0:10:08,000
"Alright, I'm done. What do you want me to do?

234
0:10:08.6,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Should I keep things as they are

235
0:10:10.2,000 --> 0:10:12,000
or do you want me to take some extra margins around?"

236
0:10:12.72,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And then we said, "Well, hang on."

237
0:10:14.4,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We told the doctor, "You've missed those two spots,

238
0:10:16.84,000 --> 0:10:18,000
so rather than taking huge margins around,

239
0:10:18.864,000 --> 0:10:19,000
only take out those tiny little areas.

240
0:10:20.72,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Take them out, and then let's take a look."

241
0:10:22.76,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And so the doctor took them away, and lo and behold,

242
0:10:25.64,000 --> 0:10:27,000
the cancer is now completely gone.

243
0:10:27.68,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Now, the important thing

244
0:10:29.08,000 --> 0:10:31,000
is that it's not just that the cancer is completely gone

245
0:10:31.724,000 --> 0:10:32,000
from this person's brain,

246
0:10:33.08,000 --> 0:10:34,000
or from this mouse's brain.

247
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
The most important thing

248
0:10:36.44,000 --> 0:10:38,000
is that we did not have to take huge amounts of healthy brain

249
0:10:39.36,000 --> 0:10:4,000
in the process.

250
0:10:40.6,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And so now we can actually imagine a world

251
0:10:42.8,000 --> 0:10:45,000
where doctors and surgeons, as they take away a tumor,

252
0:10:46.72,000 --> 0:10:47,000
they actually know what to take out,

253
0:10:48.17,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and they no longer have to guess with their thumb.

254
0:10:51.52,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Now, here's why it's extremely important to take those tiny little leftover tumors.

255
0:10:55.48,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Those leftover tumors, even if it's just a handful of cells,

256
0:10:58.36,000 --> 0:11:01,000
they will grow to recur the tumor,

257
0:11:01.44,000 --> 0:11:02,000
for the tumor to come back.

258
0:11:03.12,000 --> 0:11:04,000
In fact, the reason why 80 to 90 percent

259
0:11:05.08,000 --> 0:11:07,000
of those brain cancer surgeries ultimately fail

260
0:11:07.32,000 --> 0:11:1,000
is because of those small little extra margins that were left positive,

261
0:11:11.12,000 --> 0:11:13,000
those small little leftover tumors that were left there.

262
0:11:15.44,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So this is clearly very nice,

263
0:11:17.64,000 --> 0:11:21,000
but what I really want to share with you is where I think we're heading from here.

264
0:11:21.96,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And so in my lab at Stanford,

265
0:11:23.64,000 --> 0:11:28,000
my students and I are asking, what should we be working on now?

266
0:11:29.6,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And I think where medical imaging is heading to

267
0:11:32.48,000 --> 0:11:34,000
is the ability to look into the human body

268
0:11:34.84,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and actually see each and every one of these cells separately.

269
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:4,000
The ability like this would allow us

270
0:11:40.76,000 --> 0:11:42,000
to actually pick up tumors way, way earlier in the process,

271
0:11:43.68,000 --> 0:11:46,000
way before it's 100 million cells inside, so we can actually do something about it.

272
0:11:48.2,000 --> 0:11:51,000
An ability to see each and every one of the cells might also allow us

273
0:11:51.64,000 --> 0:11:52,000
to ask insightful questions.

274
0:11:53.04,000 --> 0:11:55,000
So in the lab, we are now getting to a point

275
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
where we can actually start asking these cancer cells real questions,

276
0:11:58.44,000 --> 0:12:01,000
like, for example, are you responding to the treatment we are giving you or not?

277
0:12:02.24,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So if you're not responding, we'll know to stop the treatment right away,

278
0:12:05.72,000 --> 0:12:07,000
days into the treatment, not three months.

279
0:12:08.48,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And so also for patients like Ehud

280
0:12:10.68,000 --> 0:12:14,000
that are going through these nasty, nasty chemotherapy drugs,

281
0:12:15.12,000 --> 0:12:16,000
for them not to suffer

282
0:12:16.4,000 --> 0:12:18,000
through those horrendous side effects of the drugs

283
0:12:19.32,000 --> 0:12:21,000
when the drugs are in fact not even helping them.

284
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So to be frank here,

285
0:12:24.96,000 --> 0:12:27,000
we're pretty far away from winning the war against cancer,

286
0:12:28.44,000 --> 0:12:29,000
just to be realistic.

287
0:12:29.72,000 --> 0:12:3,000
But at least I am hopeful

288
0:12:31.64,000 --> 0:12:35,000
that we should be able to fight this war with better medical imaging techniques

289
0:12:35.8,000 --> 0:12:36,000
in the way that is not blind.

290
0:12:37.68,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Thank you.

291
0:12:38.92,000 --> 0:12:4,000
(Applause)

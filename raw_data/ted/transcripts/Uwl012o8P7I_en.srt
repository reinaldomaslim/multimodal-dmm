1
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I've been fascinated with crop diversity for about 35 years from now,

2
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
ever since I stumbled across a fairly obscure academic article

3
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
by a guy named Jack Harlan.

4
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And he described the diversity within crops --

5
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such --

6
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
as a genetic resource.

7
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And he said, "This genetic resource," --

8
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and I'll never forget the words --

9
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
"stands between us and catastrophic starvation

10
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
on a scale we cannot imagine."

11
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I figured he was either really on to something,

12
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
or he was one of these academic nutcases.

13
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So, I looked a little further,

14
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and what I figured out was that he wasn't a nutcase.

15
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
He was the most respected scientist in the field.

16
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
What he understood was that biological diversity -- crop diversity --

17
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
is the biological foundation of agriculture.

18
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It's the raw material, the stuff, of evolution in our agricultural crops.

19
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Not a trivial matter.

20
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And he also understood that that foundation was crumbling,

21
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
literally crumbling.

22
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
That indeed, a mass extinction was underway

23
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
in our fields, in our agricultural system.

24
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And that this mass extinction was taking place

25
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
with very few people noticing

26
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and even fewer caring.

27
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Now, I know that many of you don't stop

28
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to think about diversity in agricultural systems

29
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and, let's face it, that's logical.

30
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
You don't see it in the newspaper every day.

31
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And when you go into the supermarket, you certainly don't see a lot of choices there.

32
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
You see apples that are red, yellow, and green and that's about it.

33
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So, let me show you a picture of one form of diversity.

34
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Here's some beans,

35
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and there are about 35 or 40 different

36
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
varieties of beans on this picture.

37
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Now, imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another

38
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
about the same way as a poodle from a Great Dane.

39
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
If I wanted to show you a picture of all the dog breeds in the world,

40
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and I put 30 or 40 of them on a slide, it would take about 10 slides

41
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
because there about 400 breeds of dogs in the world.

42
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But there are 35 to 40,000 different varieties of beans.

43
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So if I were to going to show you all the beans in the world,

44
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and I had a slide like this, and I switched it every second,

45
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
it would take up my entire TED talk,

46
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and I wouldn't have to say anything.

47
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But the interesting thing is that this diversity -- and the tragic thing is --

48
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that this diversity is being lost.

49
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We have about 200,000 different varieties of wheat,

50
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and we have about 2 to 400,000 different varieties of rice,

51
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but it's being lost.

52
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And I want to give you an example of that.

53
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It's a bit of a personal example, in fact.

54
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
In the United States, in the 1800s -- that's where we have the best data --

55
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
farmers and gardeners were growing 7,100

56
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
named varieties of apples.

57
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Imagine that. 7,100 apples with names.

58
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Today, 6,800 of those are extinct,

59
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
no longer to be seen again.

60
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I used to have a list of these extinct apples,

61
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and when I would go out and give a presentation,

62
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I would pass the list out in the audience.

63
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I wouldn't tell them what it was, but it was in alphabetical order,

64
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and I would tell them to look for their names, their family names,

65
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
their mother's maiden name.

66
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And at the end of the speech, I would ask, "How many people have found a name?"

67
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And I never had fewer than two-thirds of an audience hold up their hand.

68
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And I said, "You know what? These apples come from your ancestors,

69
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them.

70
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
They gave them their name.

71
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
The bad news is they're extinct.

72
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The good news is a third of you didn't hold up your hand. Your apple's still out there.

73
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Find it. Make sure it doesn't join the list."

74
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So, I want to tell you that the piece of the good news is

75
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that the Fowler apple is still out there.

76
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And there's an old book back here,

77
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and I want to read a piece from it.

78
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
This book was published in 1904.

79
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It's called "The Apples of New York" and this is the second volume.

80
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
See, we used to have a lot of apples.

81
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And the Fowler apple is described in here --

82
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I hope this doesn't surprise you --

83
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
as, "a beautiful fruit."

84
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Laughter)

85
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I don't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us, but ...

86
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
but, to be honest, the description goes on

87
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and it says that it "doesn't rank high in quality, however."

88
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And then he has to go even further.

89
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
It sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine.

90
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
"As grown in New York, the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and quality

91
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and is, on the whole, unsatisfactory."

92
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And I guess there's a lesson to be learned here,

94
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and the lesson is: so why save it?

95
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I get this question all the time. Why don't we just save the best one?

96
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And there are a couple of answers to that question.

97
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
One thing is that there is no such thing as a best one.

98
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Today's best variety is tomorrow's lunch for insects or pests or disease.

99
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The other thing is that maybe that Fowler apple

100
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
or maybe a variety of wheat that's not economical right now

101
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
has disease or pest resistance

102
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
or some quality that we're going to need for climate change that the others don't.

103
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So it's not necessary, thank God,

104
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that the Fowler apple is the best apple in the world.

105
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
It's just necessary or interesting that it might have one good, unique trait.

106
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And for that reason, we ought to be saving it.

107
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Why? As a raw material, as a trait we can use in the future.

108
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Think of diversity as giving us options.

109
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And options, of course, are exactly what we need in an era of climate change.

110
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I want to show you two slides,

111
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
but first, I want to tell you that we've been working at the Global Crop Diversity Trust

112
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
with a number of scientists -- particularly at Stanford and University of Washington --

113
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to ask the question: What's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change

114
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops

115
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to be able to adapt to this?

116
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
In short, the answer is that in the future, in many countries,

117
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter

118
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
than anything those crops have seen in the past.

119
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
The coldest growing seasons of the future,

120
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
hotter than the hottest of the past.

121
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Is agriculture adapted to that?

122
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I don't know. Can fish play the piano?

123
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
If agriculture hasn't experienced that, how could it be adapted?

124
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Now, the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world,

125
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and the place where climate change, ironically, is going to be the worst

126
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
is in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

127
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So I've picked two examples here, and I want to show you.

128
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
In the histogram before you now,

129
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
the blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures,

130
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
going back about far as we have temperature data.

131
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And you can see that there's some difference

132
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
between one growing season and another.

133
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Some are colder, some are hotter and it's a bell shaped curve.

134
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
The tallest bar is the average temperature for the most number of growing seasons.

135
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
In the future, later this century, it's going to look like the red,

136
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
totally out of bounds.

137
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
The agricultural system and, more importantly, the crops in the field in India

138
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
have never experienced this before.

139
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Here's South Africa. The same story.

140
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
But the most interesting thing about South Africa is

141
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
we don't have to wait for 2070 for there to be trouble.

142
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
By 2030, if the maize, or corn, varieties, which is the dominant crop --

143
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
50 percent of the nutrition in Southern Africa are still in the field --

144
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
in 2030, we'll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize

145
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
because of the climate change already in 2030.

146
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
30 percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population,

147
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that's a food crisis. It's global in nature.

148
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
We will watch children starve to death on TV.

149
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Now, you may say that 20 years is a long way off.

150
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
It's two breeding cycles for maize.

151
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
We have two rolls of the dice to get this right.

152
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We have to get climate-ready crops in the field,

153
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and we have to do that rather quickly.

154
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Now, the good news is that we have conserved.

155
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity,

156
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
agricultural diversity, mostly in the form of seed,

157
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and we put it in seed banks, which is a fancy way of saying a freezer.

158
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
If you want to conserve seed for a long term

159
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers,

160
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
you dry it and then you freeze it.

161
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Unfortunately, these seed banks are located around the world in buildings

162
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and they're vulnerable.

163
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Disasters have happened. In recent years we lost the gene bank,

164
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
the seed bank in Iraq and Afghanistan. You can guess why.

165
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
In Rwanda, in the Solomon Islands.

166
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings,

167
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures,

168
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and all kinds of things, and every time something like this happens,

169
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
it means extinction. We lose diversity.

170
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And I'm not talking about losing diversity in the same way that you lose your car keys.

171
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
I'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs:

172
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
actually losing it, never to be seen again.

173
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
So, a number of us got together and decided that, you know, enough is enough

174
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility

175
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that can really offer protection for our biological diversity of --

176
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
maybe not the most charismatic diversity.

177
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
You don't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear,

178
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
but it's very important diversity.

179
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So we needed a really safe place, and we went quite far north to find it.

180
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
To Svalbard, in fact.

181
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
This is above mainland Norway. You can see Greenland there.

182
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
That's at 78 degrees north.

183
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
It's as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane.

184
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
It's a remarkably beautiful landscape. I can't even begin to describe it to you.

185
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
It's otherworldly, beautiful.

186
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
We worked with the Norwegian government

187
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and with the NorGen, the Norwegian Genetic Resources Program,

188
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
to design this facility.

189
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
What you see is an artist's conception of this facility,

190
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
which is built in a mountain in Svalbard.

191
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
The idea of Svalbard was that it's cold,

192
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
so we get natural freezing temperatures.

193
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
But it's remote. It's remote and accessible

194
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
so it's safe and we don't depend on mechanical refrigeration.

195
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
This is more than just an artist's dream, it's now a reality.

196
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And this next picture shows it in context, in Svalbard.

197
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And here's the front door of this facility.

198
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
When you open up the front door,

199
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
this is what you're looking at. It's pretty simple. It's a hole in the ground.

200
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
It's a tunnel, and you go into the tunnel,

201
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
chiseled in solid rock, about 130 meters.

202
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
There are now a couple of security doors, so you won't see it quite like this.

203
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Again, when you get to the back, you get into an area that's really my favorite place.

204
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I think of it as sort of a cathedral.

205
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And I know that this tags me as a bit of a nerd, but ...

206
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
(Laughter)

207
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Some of the happiest days of my life have been spent ...

208
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
(Laughter)

209
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
in this place there.

210
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Applause)

211
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
If you were to walk into one of these rooms, you would see this.

212
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
It's not very exciting, but if you know what's there, it's pretty emotional.

213
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
We have now about 425,000

214
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
samples of unique crop varieties.

215
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
There's 70,000 samples of different varieties of rice

216
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
in this facility right now.

217
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
About a year from now, we'll have over half a million samples.

218
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
We're going up to over a million, and someday we'll basically have samples --

219
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
about 500 seeds --

220
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state

221
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
in this facility.

222
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
This is a backup system for world agriculture.

223
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
It's a backup system for all the seed banks. Storage is free.

224
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
It operates like a safety deposit box.

225
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Norway owns the mountain and the facility, but the depositors own the seed.

226
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And if anything happens, then they can come back and get it.

227
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
This particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the United States,

228
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
of Canada, and an international institution from Syria.

229
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I think it's interesting in that this facility, I think,

230
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
is almost the only thing I can think of these days where countries,

231
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
literally, every country in the world --

232
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
because we have seeds from every country in the world --

233
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
all the countries of the world have gotten together

234
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
to do something that's both long term, sustainable and positive.

235
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
I can't think of anything else that's happened in my lifetime that way.

236
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a solution

237
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
for climate change, for the water crisis.

238
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Agriculture takes 70 percent of fresh water supplies on earth.

239
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution

240
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
for those things, or the energy crisis, or world hunger, or peace in conflict.

241
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a simple solution for that,

242
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
but I can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can't solve any of those problems

243
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
if we don't have crop diversity.

244
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
Because I challenge you to think of an effective, efficient, sustainable

245
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
solution to climate change if we don't have crop diversity.

246
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Because, quite literally, if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change,

247
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
neither will we.

248
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And if crops don't adapt to climate change, neither will agriculture,

249
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
neither will we.

250
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
So, this is not something pretty and nice to do.

251
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
There are a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exist

252
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
just for the existence value of it.

253
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
It is, I agree, a nice thing to do.

254
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
But it's a necessary thing to do.

255
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
So, in a very real sense, I believe that we, as an international community,

256
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
should get organized to complete the task.

257
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a wonderful gift

258
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
that Norway and others have given us,

259
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
but it's not the complete answer.

260
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
We need to collect the remaining diversity that's out there.

261
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
We need to put it into good seed banks

262
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
that can offer those seeds to researchers in the future.

263
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:,000
We need to catalog it. It's a library of life,

264
0:16:00.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
but right now I would say we don't have a card catalog for it.

265
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And we need to support it financially.

266
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
My big idea would be that while we think of it as commonplace

267
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
to endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university,

268
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:21,000
we really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat.

269
0:16:21.33,000 --> 0:16:25,000
30 million dollars in an endowment would take care

270
0:16:25.33,000 --> 0:16:29,000
of preserving all the diversity in wheat forever.

271
0:16:29.33,000 --> 0:16:32,000
So we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms.

272
0:16:32.33,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And my final thought is that we, of course, by conserving wheat,

273
0:16:40.33,000 --> 0:16:43,000
rice, potatoes, and the other crops,

274
0:16:43.33,000 --> 0:16:47,000
we may, quite simply, end up saving ourselves.

275
0:16:47.33,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Thank you.

276
0:16:49.33,000 --> 0:17:01,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
There was a time in my life

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
when everything seemed perfect.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Everywhere I went, I felt at home.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Everyone I met,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I felt I knew them for as long as I could remember.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And I want to share with you how I came to that place

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and what I've learned since I left it.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
This is where it began.

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And it raises an existential question,

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
which is, if I'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness,

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
why am I not visible in the photograph,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and where is this time and place?

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
This is Los Angeles, California, where I live.

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
This is a police photo. That's actually my car.

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
We're less than a mile from one of the largest hospitals in Los Angeles,

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
called Cedars-Sinai.

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
And the situation is that a car full of paramedics

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
on their way home from the hospital after work

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
have run across the wreckage,

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and they've advised the police

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that there were no survivors inside the car,

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that the driver's dead, that I'm dead.

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And the police are waiting for the fire department to arrive

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to cut apart the vehicle

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to extract the body of the driver.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And when they do, they find that behind the glass,

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
they find me.

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And my skull's crushed and my collar bone is crushed;

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
all but two of my ribs,

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
my pelvis and both arms --

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
they're all crushed, but there is still a pulse.

32
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And they get me to that nearby hospital,

33
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Cedars-Sinai,

34
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
where that night I receive, because of my internal bleeding,

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
45 units of blood --

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
which means full replacements of all the blood in me --

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
before they're able to staunch the flow.

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I'm put on full life support,

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and I have a massive stroke,

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and my brain drops into a coma.

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Now comas are measured

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
on a scale from 15 down to three.

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
Fifteen is a mild coma. Three is the deepest.

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And if you look, you'll see that there's only one way you can score three.

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It's essentially there's no sign of life

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
from outside at all.

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I spent more than a month in a Glasgow Coma Scale three,

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and it is inside that deepest level of coma,

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
on the rim between my life and my death,

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that I'm experiencing the full connection and full consciousness

51
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
of inner space.

52
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
From my family looking in from outside,

53
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
what they're trying to figure out

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
is a different kind of existential question,

55
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
which is, how far is it going to be possible to bridge

56
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
from the comatose potential mind that they're looking at

57
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to an actual mind,

58
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
which I define simply

59
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
as the functioning of the brain

60
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that is remaining inside my head.

61
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Now to put this into a broader context,

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I want you to imagine that you are an eternal alien

63
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
watching the Earth from outer space,

64
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and your favorite show on intergalactic satellite television

65
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
is the Earth channel,

66
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and your favorite show is the Human Show.

67
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And the reason I think it would be so interesting to you

68
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
is because consciousness is so interesting.

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It's so unpredictable

70
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and so fragile.

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And this is how we began.

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
We all began in the Awash Valley in Ethiopia.

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
The show began with tremendous special effects,

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
because there were catastrophic climate shifts --

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today.

76
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Because of the Earth tilting on its axis

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and those catastrophic climate shifts,

78
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
we had to figure out how to find better food,

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and we had to learn -- there's Lucy; that's how we all began --

80
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
we had to learn how to crack open animal bones,

81
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
use tools to do that, to feed on the marrow,

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to grow our brains more.

83
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So we actually grew our consciousness

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
in response to this global threat.

85
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Now you also continue to watch

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
as consciousness evolved to the point

87
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that here in India, in Madhya Pradesh,

88
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
there's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found.

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It's a cupule that took 40 to 50,000 blows with a stone tool to create,

90
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and it's the first known expression of art

91
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
on the planet.

92
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
And the reason it connects us with consciousness today

93
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
is that all of us still today,

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
the very first shape we draw as a child

95
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
is a circle.

96
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And then the next thing we do is we put a dot in the center of the circle.

97
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We create an eye --

98
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and the eye that evolves through all of our history.

99
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
There's the Egyptian god Horus,

100
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
which symbolizes prosperity, wisdom and health.

101
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And that comes down right way to the present

102
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
with the dollar bill in the United States,

103
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
which has on it an eye of providence.

104
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So watching all of this show from outer space,

105
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
you think we get it, we understand

106
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that the most precious resource on the blue planet

107
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
is our consciousness.

108
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Because it's the first thing we draw;

109
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
we surround ourselves with images of it;

110
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
it's probably the most common image on the planet.

111
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But we don't. We take our consciousness for granted.

112
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
While I was producing in Los Angeles, I never thought about it for a second.

113
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Until it was stripped from me, I never thought about it.

114
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And what I've learned since that event

115
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and during my recovery

116
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
is that consciousness is under threat on this planet

117
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
in ways it's never been under threat before.

118
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
These are just some examples.

119
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And the reason I'm so honored to be here

120
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to talk today in India

121
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
is because India has the sad distinction

122
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
of being the head injury capital of the world.

123
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
That statistic is so sad.

124
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
There is no more drastic and sudden gap created

125
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
between potential and actual mind

126
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
than a severe head injury.

127
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Each one can entail up to a decade of rehabilitation,

128
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
which means that India, unless something changes,

129
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
is accumulating a need

130
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
for millennia of rehabilitation.

131
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
What you find in the United States

132
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
is an injury every 20 seconds -- that's one and a half million every year --

133
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
stroke every 40 seconds,

134
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Alzheimer's disease, every 70 seconds somebody succumbs to that.

135
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
All of these represent gaps

136
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
between potential mind and actual mind.

137
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And here are some of the other categories, if you look at the whole planet.

138
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
The World Health Organization tells us

139
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that depression is the number one disease on Earth

140
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
in terms of years lived with disability.

141
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We find that the number two source of disability

142
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
is depression in the age group

143
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
of 15 to 44.

144
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Our children are becoming depressed

145
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
at an alarming rate.

146
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I discovered during my recovery

147
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
the third leading cause of death amongst teenagers

148
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
is suicide.

149
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
If you look at some of these other items -- concussions.

150
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Half of E.R. admissions from adolescents

151
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
are for concussions.

152
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
If I talk about migraine,

153
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
40 percent of the population

154
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
suffer episodic headaches.

155
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Fifteen percent suffer migraines

156
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that wipe them out for days on end.

157
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
All of this is leading -- computer addiction,

158
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
just to cover that: the most frequent thing we do

159
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
is use digital devices.

160
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
The average teenager

161
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
sends 3,300 texts every [month].

162
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
We're talking about a society that is retreating

163
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
into depression and disassociation

164
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
when we are potentially confronting

165
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
the next great catastrophic climate shift.

166
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So what you'd be wondering, watching the Human Show,

167
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
is are we going to confront and address

168
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
the catastrophic climate shift that may be heading our way

169
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
by growing our consciousness,

170
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
or are we going to continue to retreat?

171
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And that then might lead you

172
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to watch an episode one day

173
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
of Cedars-Sinai medical center

174
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and a consideration of the difference between potential mind and actual mind.

175
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
This is a dense array EEG MRI

176
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
tracking 156 channels of information.

177
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It's not my EEG at Cedars;

178
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
it's your EEG tonight and last night.

179
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It's the what our minds do every night

180
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to digest the day

181
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and to prepare to bridge from the potential mind when we're asleep

182
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to the actual mind when we awaken the following morning.

183
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
This is how I was when I returned from the hospital

184
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
after nearly four months.

185
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
The horseshoe shape you can see on my skull

186
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
is where they operated and went inside my brain

187
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to do the surgeries they needed to do to rescue my life.

188
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But if you look into the eye of consciousness, that single eye you can see,

189
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I'm looking down,

190
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
but let me tell you how I felt at that point.

191
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I didn't feel empty; I felt everything simultaneously.

192
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I felt empty and full, hot and cold,

193
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
euphoric and depressed

194
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
because the brain is the world's first

195
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
fully functional quantum computer;

196
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
it can occupy multiple states at the same time.

197
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And with all the internal regulators of my brain damaged,

198
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I felt everything simultaneously.

199
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
But let's swivel around and look at me frontally.

200
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
This is now flash-forward to the point in time

201
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
where I've been discharged by the health system.

202
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Look into those eyes. I'm not able to focus those eyes.

203
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I'm not able to follow a line of text in a book.

204
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
But the system has moved me on

205
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
because, as my family started to discover,

206
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
there is no long-term concept

207
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
in the health care system.

208
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Neurological damage, 10 years of rehab,

209
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
requires a long-term perspective.

210
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
But let's take a look behind my eyes.

211
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
This is a gamma radiation spec scan

212
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that uses gamma radiation

213
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to map three-dimensional function within the brain.

214
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
It requires a laboratory to see it in three dimension,

215
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
but in two dimensions I think you can see

216
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
the beautiful symmetry and illumination

217
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
of a normal mind at work.

218
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Here's my brain.

219
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
That is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain

220
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
being destroyed by the stroke.

221
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So my family, as we moved forward

222
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and discovered that the health care system had moved us by,

223
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
had to try to find solutions and answers.

224
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And during that process -- it took many years --

225
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
one of the doctors said that my recovery, my degree of advance,

226
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
since the amount of head injury I'd suffered,

227
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
was miraculous.

228
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And that was when I started to write a book,

229
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
because I didn't think it was miraculous.

230
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I thought there were miraculous elements,

231
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
but I also didn't think it was right

232
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that one should have to struggle and search for answers

233
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
when this is a pandemic within our society.

234
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So from this experience of my recovery,

235
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I want to share four particular aspects --

236
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I call them the four C's of consciousness --

237
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that helped me grow my potential mind

238
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
back towards the actual mind that I work with every day.

239
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
The first C is cognitive training.

240
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Unlike the smashed glass of my car,

241
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
plasticity of the brain

242
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
means that there was always a possibility, with treatment,

243
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to train the brain

244
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
so that you can regain and raise your level of awareness and consciousness.

245
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Plasticity means that there was always

246
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
hope for our reason --

247
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
hope for our ability to rebuild that function.

248
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Indeed, the mind can redefine itself,

249
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and this is demonstrated by two specialists called Hagen and Silva

250
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
back in the 1970's.

251
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
The global perspective

252
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
is that up to 30 percent of children in school

253
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
have learning weaknesses

254
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
that are not self-correcting,

255
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
but with appropriate treatment,

256
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
they can be screened for and detected and corrected

257
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and avoid their academic failure.

258
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
But what I discovered is it's almost impossible to find anyone

259
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
who provides that treatment or care.

260
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Here's what my neuropsychologist provided for me

261
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
when I actually found somebody who could apply it.

262
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I'm not a doctor, so I'm not going to talk about the various subtests.

263
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Let's just talk about full-scale I.Q.

264
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Full-scale I.Q. is the mental processing --

265
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
how fast you can acquire information,

266
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
retain it and retrieve it --

267
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
that is essential for success in life today.

268
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And you can see here there are three columns.

269
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Untestable -- that's when I'm in my coma.

270
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And then I creep up to the point that I get a score of 79,

271
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
which is just below average.

272
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
In the health care system, if you touch average, you're done.

273
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
That's when I was discharged from the system.

274
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
What does average I.Q. really mean?

275
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
It meant that when I was given two and a half hours

276
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
to take a test that anyone here

277
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
would take in 50 minutes,

278
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I might score an F.

279
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
This is a very, very low level

280
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
in order to be kicked out of the health care system.

281
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Then I underwent cognitive training.

282
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And let me show you what happened to the right-hand column

283
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
when I did my cognitive training over a period of time.

284
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
This is not supposed to occur.

285
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I.Q. is supposed to stabilize and solidify

286
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
at the age of eight.

287
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Now the Journal of the National Medical Association

288
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
gave my memoir a full clinical review,

289
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
which is very unusual.

290
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I'm not a doctor. I have no medical background whatsoever.

291
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
But they felt the evidences

292
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
that there was important, valuable information in the book,

293
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and they commented about it when they gave the full peer review to it.

294
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
But they asked one question. They said, "Is this repeatable?"

295
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
That was a fair question

296
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
because my memoir was simply how I found solutions that worked for me.

297
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
The answer is yes, and for the first time,

298
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
it's my pleasure to be able to share two examples.

299
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Here's somebody, what they did as they went through cognitive training

300
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
at ages seven and 11.

301
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And here's another person in, call it, high school and college.

302
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And this person is particularly interesting.

303
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I won't go into the intrascatter that's in the subtests,

304
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
but they still had a neurologic issue.

305
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
But that person could be identified

306
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
as having a learning disability.

307
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And with accommodation, they went on to college

308
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and had a full life in terms of their opportunities.

309
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Second aspect:

310
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I still had crushing migraine headaches.

311
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Two elements that worked for me here

312
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
are -- the first is 90 percent, I learned, of head and neck pain

313
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
is through muscular-skeletal imbalance.

314
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
The craniomandibular system is critical to that.

315
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And when I underwent it and found solutions,

316
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
this is the interrelationship between the TMJ and the teeth.

317
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Up to 30 percent of the population

318
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
have a disorder, disease or dysfunction in the jaw

319
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
that affects the entire body.

320
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I was fortunate to find a dentist

321
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
who applied this entire universe

322
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
of technology you're about to see

323
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
to establish that if he repositioned my jaw,

324
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
the headaches pretty much resolved,

325
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
but that then my teeth weren't in the right place.

326
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
He then held my jaw in the right position

327
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
while orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment.

328
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
So my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position.

329
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
This affected my entire body.

330
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
If that sounds like a very, very strange thing to say

331
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and rather a bold statement --

332
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
How can the jaw affect the entire body? --

333
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
let me simply point out to you,

334
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
if I ask you tomorrow

335
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
to put one grain of sand between your teeth

336
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and go for a nice long walk,

337
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
how far would you last

338
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
before you had to remove that grain of sand?

339
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
That tiny misalignment.

340
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Bear in mind, there are no nerves in the teeth.

341
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
That's why the same between the before and after that this shows,

342
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
it's hard to see the difference.

343
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Now just trying putting a few grains of sand between your teeth

344
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and see the difference it makes.

345
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I still had migraine headaches.

346
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
The next issue that resolved

347
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
was that, if 90 percent of head and neck pain

348
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
is caused by imbalance,

349
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
the other 10 percent, largely --

350
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
if you set aside aneurysms, brain cancer

351
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and hormonal issues --

352
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
is the circulation.

353
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Imagine the blood flowing through your body --

354
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
I was told at UCLA Medical Center --

355
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
as one sealed system.

356
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
There's a big pipe with the blood flowing through it,

357
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and around that pipe are the nerves

358
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
drawing their nutrient supply from the blood.

359
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
That's basically it.

360
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
If you press on a hose pipe in a sealed system,

361
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
it bulges someplace else.

362
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
If that some place else where it bulges

363
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
is inside the biggest nerve in your body, your brain,

364
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
you get a vascular migraine.

365
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
This is a level of pain that's only known

366
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
to other people who suffer vascular migraines.

367
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Using this technology,

368
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
this is mapping in three dimensions.

369
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
This is an MRI MRA MRV,

370
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
a volumetric MRI.

371
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Using this technology, the specialists at UCLA Medical Center

372
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
were able to identify

373
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring.

374
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
A vascular surgeon removed most of the first rib on both sides of my body.

375
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And in the following months and years,

376
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
I felt the neurological flow of life itself returning.

377
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Communication, the next C. This is critical.

378
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
All consciousness is about communication.

379
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And here, by great fortune,

380
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
one of my father's clients

381
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
had a husband who worked

382
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
at the Alfred Mann Foundation for Scientific Research.

383
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Alfred Mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator

384
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
who's fascinated with bridging gaps in consciousness,

385
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
whether to restore hearing to the deaf, vision to the blind

386
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
or movement to the paralyzed.

387
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And I'm just going to give you an example today

388
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
of movement to the paralyzed.

389
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
I've brought with me, from Southern California,

390
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
the FM device.

391
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
This is it being held in the hand.

392
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
It weighs less than a gram.

393
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
So two of them implanted in the body would weigh less than a dime.

394
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Five of them would still weigh less

395
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
than a rupee coin.

396
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Where does it go inside the body?

397
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
It has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion-free

398
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
for over 80 years.

399
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
So it goes in and it stays there.

400
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Here are the implantation sites.

401
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
The concept that they're working towards -- and they have working prototypes --

402
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
is that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body

403
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
where they're needed.

404
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
The main unit will then go inside the brain.

405
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
An FM device in the cortex of the brain, the motor cortex,

406
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
will send signals in real time

407
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
to the motor points in the relevant muscles

408
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
so that the person will be able to move their arm, let's say, in real time,

409
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
if they've lost control of their arm.

410
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
And other FM devices implanted in fingertips,

411
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
on contacting a surface,

412
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
will send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain,

413
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
so that the person feels a sense of touch.

414
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Is this science fiction? No,

415
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
because I'm wearing the first application of this technology.

416
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
I don't have the ability to control my left foot.

417
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
A radio device is controlling every step I take,

418
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and a sensor picks up my foot for me

419
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
every time I walk.

420
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
And in closing, I want to share

421
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
the personal reason why this meant so much to me

422
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and changed the direction of my life.

423
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
In my coma, one of the presences I sensed

424
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
was someone I felt was a protector.

425
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
And when I came out of my coma, I recognized my family,

426
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
but I didn't remember my own past.

427
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Gradually, I remembered the protector was my wife.

428
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
And I whispered the good news

429
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
through my broken jaw, which was wired shut,

430
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
to my night nurse.

431
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
And the following morning, my mother came to explain

432
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
that I'd not always been in this bed, in this room,

433
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
that I'd been working in film and television

434
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and that I had been in a crash

435
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
and that, yes, I was married,

436
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
but Marcy had been killed instantly in the crash.

437
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
And during my time in coma,

438
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
she had been laid to rest in her hometown of Phoenix.

439
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Now in the dark years that followed, I had to work out what remained for me

440
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
if everything that made today special was gone.

441
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
And as I discovered these threats to consciousness

442
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
and how they are surrounding the world

443
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
and enveloping the lives of more and more people every day,

444
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
I discovered what truly remained.

445
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
I believe that we can overcome the threats to our consciousness,

446
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
that the Human Show can stay on the air

447
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
for millennia to come.

448
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
I believe that we can all rise and shine.

449
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
Thank you very much.

450
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
(Applause)

451
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
Lakshmi Pratury: Just stay for a second. Just stay here for a second.

452
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
(Applause)

453
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
You know,

454
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
when I heard Simon's --

455
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
please sit down; I just want to talk to him for a second --

456
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
when I read his book, I went to LA to meet him.

457
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
And so I was sitting in this restaurant,

458
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
waiting for a man to come by

459
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
who obviously would have some difficulty ...

460
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
I don't know what I had in my mind.

461
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
And he was walking around.

462
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
I didn't expect that person that I was going to meet

463
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
to be him.

464
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
And then we met and we talked,

465
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
and I'm like, he doesn't look

466
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
like somebody who was built out of nothing.

467
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
And then I was amazed

468
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
at what role technology played

469
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
in your recovery.

470
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
And we have his book outside

471
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:,000
in the bookshop.

472
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
The thing that amazed me

473
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:05,000
is the painstaking detail

474
0:19:05.26,000 --> 0:19:07,000
with which he has written

475
0:19:07.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
every hospital he has been to,

476
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:11,000
every treatment he got,

477
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:14,000
every near-miss he had,

478
0:19:14.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
and how accidentally he stumbled upon innovations.

479
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:23,000
So I think this one detail

480
0:19:23.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
went past people really quick.

481
0:19:25.26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
Tell a little bit about what you're wearing on your leg.

482
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
Simon Lewis: I knew when I was timing this

483
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:32,000
that there wouldn't be time for me to do anything about --

484
0:19:32.26,000 --> 0:19:35,000
Well this is it. This is the control unit.

485
0:19:35.26,000 --> 0:19:37,000
And this records every single step I've taken

486
0:19:37.26,000 --> 0:19:39,000
for, ooh, five or six years now.

487
0:19:39.26,000 --> 0:19:42,000
And if I do this, probably the mic won't hear it.

488
0:19:44.26,000 --> 0:19:47,000
That little chirp followed by two chirps is now switched on.

489
0:19:47.26,000 --> 0:19:5,000
When I press it again, it'll chirp three times,

490
0:19:50.26,000 --> 0:19:53,000
and that'll mean that it's armed and ready to go.

491
0:19:54.26,000 --> 0:19:57,000
And that's my friend. I mean, I charge it every night.

492
0:19:57.26,000 --> 0:19:59,000
And it works. It works.

493
0:19:59.26,000 --> 0:20:02,000
And what I would love to add because I didn't have time ...

494
0:20:02.26,000 --> 0:20:05,000
What does it do? Well actually, I'll show you down here.

495
0:20:05.26,000 --> 0:20:08,000
This down here, if the camera can see that,

496
0:20:08.26,000 --> 0:20:11,000
that is a small antenna.

497
0:20:11.26,000 --> 0:20:14,000
Underneath my heel, there is a sensor

498
0:20:14.26,000 --> 0:20:16,000
that detects when my foot leaves the ground --

499
0:20:16.26,000 --> 0:20:18,000
what's called the heel lift.

500
0:20:18.26,000 --> 0:20:21,000
This thing blinks all the time; I'll leave it out, so you might be able to see it.

501
0:20:21.26,000 --> 0:20:24,000
But this is blinking all the time. It's sending signals in real time.

502
0:20:24.26,000 --> 0:20:27,000
And if you walk faster, if I walk faster,

503
0:20:27.26,000 --> 0:20:29,000
it detects what's called the time interval,

504
0:20:29.26,000 --> 0:20:31,000
which is the interval between each heel lift.

505
0:20:31.26,000 --> 0:20:35,000
And it accelerates the amount and level of the stimulation.

506
0:20:35.26,000 --> 0:20:38,000
The other things they've worked on -- I didn't have time to say this in my talk --

507
0:20:38.26,000 --> 0:20:4,000
is they've restored functional hearing

508
0:20:40.26,000 --> 0:20:42,000
to thousands of deaf people.

509
0:20:42.26,000 --> 0:20:45,000
I could tell you the story: this was going to be an abandoned technology,

510
0:20:45.26,000 --> 0:20:47,000
but Alfred Mann met the doctor who was going to retire,

511
0:20:47.26,000 --> 0:20:49,000
[Dr. Schindler.]

512
0:20:49.26,000 --> 0:20:52,000
And he was going to retire -- all the technology was going to be lost,

513
0:20:52.26,000 --> 0:20:55,000
because not a single medical manufacturer would take it on

514
0:20:55.26,000 --> 0:20:57,000
because it was a small issue.

515
0:20:57.26,000 --> 0:21:,000
But there's millions of deaf people in the world,

516
0:21:00.26,000 --> 0:21:03,000
and the Cochlear implant has given hearing to thousands of deaf people now.

517
0:21:03.26,000 --> 0:21:05,000
It works.

518
0:21:05.26,000 --> 0:21:08,000
And the other thing is they're working on artificial retinas for the blind.

519
0:21:08.26,000 --> 0:21:11,000
And this, this is the implantable generation.

520
0:21:11.26,000 --> 0:21:13,000
Because what I didn't say in my talk

521
0:21:13.26,000 --> 0:21:15,000
is this is actually exoskeletal.

522
0:21:15.26,000 --> 0:21:17,000
I should clarify that.

523
0:21:17.26,000 --> 0:21:19,000
Because the first generation is exoskeletal,

524
0:21:19.26,000 --> 0:21:21,000
it's wrapped around the leg,

525
0:21:21.26,000 --> 0:21:23,000
around the affected limb.

526
0:21:23.26,000 --> 0:21:25,000
I must tell you, they're an amazing --

527
0:21:25.26,000 --> 0:21:27,000
there's a hundred people who work in that building --

528
0:21:27.26,000 --> 0:21:29,000
engineers, scientists,

529
0:21:29.26,000 --> 0:21:31,000
and other team members -- all the time.

530
0:21:31.26,000 --> 0:21:34,000
Alfred Mann has set up this foundation

531
0:21:34.26,000 --> 0:21:36,000
to advance this research

532
0:21:36.26,000 --> 0:21:38,000
because he saw

533
0:21:38.26,000 --> 0:21:41,000
there's no way venture capital would come in for something like this.

534
0:21:41.26,000 --> 0:21:43,000
The audience is too small.

535
0:21:43.26,000 --> 0:21:45,000
You'd think, there's plenty of paralyzed people in the world,

536
0:21:45.26,000 --> 0:21:47,000
but the audience is too small,

537
0:21:47.26,000 --> 0:21:5,000
and the amount of research, the time it takes,

538
0:21:50.26,000 --> 0:21:52,000
the FDA clearances,

539
0:21:52.26,000 --> 0:21:54,000
the payback time is too long

540
0:21:54.26,000 --> 0:21:56,000
for V.C. to be interested.

541
0:21:56.26,000 --> 0:21:58,000
So he saw a need and he stepped in.

542
0:21:58.26,000 --> 0:22:01,000
He's a very, very remarkable man.

543
0:22:01.26,000 --> 0:22:04,000
He's done a lot of very cutting-edge science.

544
0:22:04.26,000 --> 0:22:06,000
LP: So when you get a chance, spend some time with Simon.

545
0:22:06.26,000 --> 0:22:08,000
Thank you. Thank you.

546
0:22:08.26,000 --> 0:22:1,000
(Applause)

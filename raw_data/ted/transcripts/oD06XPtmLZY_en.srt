1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years,

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with

3
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
is how you actually define poverty. What does it mean?

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
So often, we look at dollar terms --

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
people making less than a dollar or two or three a day.

6
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And yet the complexity of poverty really has to look at

7
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
income as only one variable.

8
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Because really, it's a condition about choice,

9
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and the lack of freedom.

10
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And I had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me

11
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
the understanding that I have.

12
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It was in Kenya, and I want to share it with you.

13
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I was with my friend Susan Meiselas, the photographer,

14
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
in the Mathare Valley slums.

15
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Now, Mathare Valley is one of the oldest slums in Africa.

16
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It's about three miles out of Nairobi,

17
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and it's a mile long and about two-tenths of a mile wide,

18
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
where over half a million people

19
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
live crammed in these little tin shacks,

20
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
generation after generation, renting them,

21
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
often eight or 10 people to a room.

22
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And it's known for prostitution, violence, drugs:

23
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
a hard place to grow up.

24
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And when we were walking through the narrow alleys,

25
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
it was literally impossible not to step in the

26
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes.

27
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But at the same time it was also

28
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
impossible not to see the human vitality,

29
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
the aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there:

30
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
women washing their babies, washing their clothes, hanging them out to dry.

31
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I met this woman, Mama Rose,

32
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
who has rented that little tin shack for 32 years,

33
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
where she lives with her seven children.

34
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Four sleep in one twin bed,

35
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor.

36
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And she keeps them all in school by selling water from that kiosk,

37
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and from selling soap and bread from the little store inside.

38
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It was also the day after the inauguration,

39
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and I was reminded how Mathare is still connected to the globe.

40
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And I would see kids on the street corners,

41
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and they'd say "Obama, he's our brother!"

42
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And I'd say "Well, Obama's my brother, so that makes you my brother too."

43
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And they would look quizzically, and then be like, "High five!"

44
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And it was here that I met Jane.

45
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in her face,

46
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and I asked her to tell me her story.

47
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
She started off by telling me her dream. She said, "I had two.

48
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
My first dream was to be a doctor,

49
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and the second was to marry a good man

50
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
who would stay with me and my family,

51
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
because my mother was a single mom,

52
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and couldn't afford to pay for school fees.

53
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So I had to give up the first dream, and I focused on the second."

54
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
She got married when she was 18, had a baby right away.

55
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And when she turned 20, found herself pregnant with a second child,

56
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
her mom died and her husband left her -- married another woman.

57
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So she was again in Mathare, with no income, no skill set, no money.

58
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And so she ultimately turned to prostitution.

59
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It wasn't organized in the way we often think of it.

60
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
She would go into the city at night with about 20 girls,

61
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
look for work, and sometimes come back with a few shillings,

62
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
or sometimes with nothing.

63
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And she said, "You know, the poverty wasn't so bad. It was the humiliation

64
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and the embarrassment of it all."

65
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
In 2001, her life changed.

66
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
She had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization, Jamii Bora,

67
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that would lend money to people no matter how poor you were,

68
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
as long as you provided a commensurate amount in savings.

69
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And so she spent a year to save 50 dollars,

70
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and started borrowing, and over time she was able to buy a sewing machine.

71
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
She started tailoring.

72
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And that turned into what she does now,

73
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
which is to go into the secondhand clothing markets,

74
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and for about three dollars and 25 cents she buys an old ball gown.

75
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Some of them might be ones you gave.

76
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And she repurposes them with frills and ribbons,

77
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and makes these frothy confections that she sells to women

78
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
for their daughter's Sweet 16 or first Holy Communion --

79
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
those milestones in a life that people want to celebrate

80
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
all along the economic spectrum.

81
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And she does really good business. In fact, I watched her

82
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
walk through the streets hawking. And before you knew it,

83
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
there was a crowd of women around her, buying these dresses.

84
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And I reflected, as I was watching her sell the dresses,

85
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and also the jewelry that she makes,

86
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that now Jane makes more than four dollars a day.

87
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And by many definitions she is no longer poor.

88
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
But she still lives in Mathare Valley.

89
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And so she can't move out.

90
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
She lives with all of that insecurity,

91
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and in fact, in January, during the ethnic riots,

92
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
she was chased from her home and had to find a new shack

93
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
in which she would live.

94
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Jamii Bora understands that and understands

95
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that when we're talking about poverty,

96
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
we've got to look at people all along the economic spectrum.

97
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And so with patient capital from Acumen and other organizations,

98
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
loans and investments that will go the long term with them,

99
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
they built a low-cost housing development,

100
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
about an hour outside Nairobi central.

101
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
And they designed it from the perspective of

102
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
customers like Jane herself,

103
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
insisting on responsibility and accountability.

104
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So she has to give 10 percent of the mortgage --

105
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
of the total value, or about 400 dollars in savings.

106
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And then they match her mortgage to what she paid in rent for her little shanty.

107
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And in the next couple of weeks, she's going to be

108
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
among the first 200 families to move into this development.

109
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
When I asked her if she feared anything,

110
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
or whether she would miss anything from Mathare,

111
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
she said, "What would I fear

112
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that I haven't confronted already?

113
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I'm HIV positive. I've dealt with it all."

114
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And she said, "What would I miss?

115
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
You think I will miss the violence or the drugs? The lack of privacy?

116
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Do you think I'll miss not knowing if my children are going to come home

117
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
at the end of the day?" She said "If you gave me 10 minutes

118
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
my bags would be packed."

119
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I said, "Well what about your dreams?"

120
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And she said, "Well, you know,

121
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
my dreams don't look exactly like I thought they would when I was a little girl.

122
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But if I think about it, I thought I wanted a husband,

123
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but what I really wanted was a family

124
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that was loving. And I fiercely love my children, and they love me back."

125
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
She said, "I thought that I wanted to be a doctor,

126
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
but what I really wanted to be was somebody

127
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
who served and healed and cured.

128
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And so I feel so blessed with everything that I have,

129
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that two days a week I go and I counsel HIV patients.

130
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And I say, 'Look at me. You are not dead.

131
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
You are still alive. And if you are still alive you have to serve.'"

132
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And she said, "I'm not a doctor who gives out pills.

133
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But maybe me, I give out something better

134
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
because I give them hope."

135
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And in the middle of this economic crisis,

136
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
where so many of us are inclined to pull in

137
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
with fear, I think we're well suited to

138
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
take a cue from Jane and reach out,

139
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary.

140
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Because when systems are broken,

141
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
like the ones that we're seeing around the world,

142
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
it's an opportunity for invention and for innovation.

143
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It's an opportunity to truly build a world

144
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
where we can extend services and products

145
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to all human beings, so that they can

146
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
make decisions and choices for themselves.

147
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I truly believe it's where dignity starts.

148
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We owe it to the Janes of the world.

149
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And just as important, we owe it to ourselves.

150
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Thank you.

151
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Applause)

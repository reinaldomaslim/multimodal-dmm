1
0:00:12.911,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So, we all have bad seasons in life.

2
0:00:15.754,000 --> 0:00:16,000
And I had one in 2013.

3
0:00:18.373,000 --> 0:00:19,000
My marriage had just ended,

4
0:00:19.743,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and I was humiliated by that failed commitment.

5
0:00:22.419,000 --> 0:00:24,000
My kids had left home for college or were leaving.

6
0:00:26.045,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I grew up mostly in the conservative movement,

7
0:00:28.392,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but conservatism had changed,

8
0:00:30.016,000 --> 0:00:31,000
so I lost a lot of those friends, too.

9
0:00:32.441,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And so what I did is, I lived alone in an apartment,

10
0:00:35.454,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and I just worked.

11
0:00:37.417,000 --> 0:00:4,000
If you opened the kitchen drawers where there should have been utensils,

12
0:00:40.854,000 --> 0:00:41,000
there were Post-it notes.

13
0:00:42.916,000 --> 0:00:45,000
If you opened the other drawers where there should have been plates,

14
0:00:46.155,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I had envelopes.

15
0:00:47.885,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I had work friends, weekday friends, but I didn't have weekend friends.

16
0:00:51.942,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And so my weekends were these long, howling silences.

17
0:00:56.268,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And I was lonely.

18
0:00:58.395,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And loneliness, unexpectedly, came to me in the form of --

19
0:01:02.399,000 --> 0:01:04,000
it felt like fear, a burning in my stomach.

20
0:01:05.272,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And it felt a little like drunkenness,

21
0:01:07.977,000 --> 0:01:11,000
just making bad decisions, just fluidity, lack of solidity.

22
0:01:13.911,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And the painful part of that moment was the awareness

23
0:01:17.201,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that the emptiness in my apartment was just reflective of the emptiness

24
0:01:20.628,000 --> 0:01:21,000
in myself,

25
0:01:22.251,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and that I had fallen for some of the lies that our culture tells us.

26
0:01:27.196,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The first lie is that career success is fulfilling.

27
0:01:30.629,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I've had a fair bit of career success,

28
0:01:32.49,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and I've found that it helps me avoid the shame I would feel

29
0:01:35.352,000 --> 0:01:36,000
if I felt myself a failure,

30
0:01:37.05,000 --> 0:01:39,000
but it hasn't given me any positive good.

31
0:01:40.201,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The second lie is I can make myself happy,

32
0:01:44.484,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that if I just win one more victory,

33
0:01:46.588,000 --> 0:01:49,000
lose 15 pounds, do a little more yoga,

34
0:01:50.103,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I'll get happy.

35
0:01:51.743,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And that's the lie of self-sufficiency.

36
0:01:54.419,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But as anybody on their deathbed will tell you,

37
0:01:57.125,000 --> 0:02:,000
the things that make people happy is the deep relationships of life,

38
0:02:00.413,000 --> 0:02:02,000
the losing of self-sufficiency.

39
0:02:03.804,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The third lie is the lie of the meritocracy.

40
0:02:07.591,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The message of the meritocracy is you are what you accomplish.

41
0:02:11.133,000 --> 0:02:13,000
The myth of the meritocracy is you can earn dignity

42
0:02:13.624,000 --> 0:02:15,000
by attaching yourself to prestigious brands.

43
0:02:16.258,000 --> 0:02:18,000
The emotion of the meritocracy is conditional love,

44
0:02:19.087,000 --> 0:02:2,000
you can "earn" your way to love.

45
0:02:20.966,000 --> 0:02:23,000
The anthropology of the meritocracy is you're not a soul to be purified,

46
0:02:24.411,000 --> 0:02:26,000
you're a set of skills to be maximized.

47
0:02:26.903,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And the evil of the meritocracy

48
0:02:28.776,000 --> 0:02:3,000
is that people who've achieved a little more than others

49
0:02:31.458,000 --> 0:02:33,000
are actually worth a little more than others.

50
0:02:34.141,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And so the wages of sin are sin.

51
0:02:36.815,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And my sins were the sins of omission--

52
0:02:38.723,000 --> 0:02:4,000
not reaching out, failing to show up for my friends,

53
0:02:41.215,000 --> 0:02:42,000
evasion, avoiding conflict.

54
0:02:43.56,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And the weird thing was that as I was falling into the valley --

55
0:02:46.712,000 --> 0:02:47,000
it was a valley of disconnection --

56
0:02:48.44,000 --> 0:02:5,000
a lot of other people were doing that, too.

57
0:02:51.014,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And that's sort of the secret to my career;

58
0:02:53.047,000 --> 0:02:54,000
a lot of the things that happen to me

59
0:02:54.844,000 --> 0:02:56,000
are always happening to a lot of other people.

60
0:02:57.026,000 --> 0:03:,000
I'm a very average person with above average communication skills.

61
0:03:00.244,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:01.371,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And so I was detached.

63
0:03:03.252,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And at the same time, a lot of other people were detached

64
0:03:06.538,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and isolated and fragmented from each other.

65
0:03:09.077,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Thirty-five percent of Americans over 45 are chronically lonely.

66
0:03:12.181,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Only eight percent of Americans report having meaningful conversation

67
0:03:15.546,000 --> 0:03:16,000
with their neighbors.

68
0:03:16.72,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Only 32 percent of Americans say they trust their neighbors,

69
0:03:19.569,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and only 18 percent of millennials.

70
0:03:21.847,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The fastest-growing political party is unaffiliated.

71
0:03:24.312,000 --> 0:03:26,000
The fastest-growing religious movement is unaffiliated.

72
0:03:26.923,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Depression rates are rising, mental health problems are rising.

73
0:03:29.923,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The suicide rate has risen 30 percent since 1999.

74
0:03:33.188,000 --> 0:03:35,000
For teen suicides over the last several years,

75
0:03:35.388,000 --> 0:03:37,000
the suicide rate has risen by 70 percent.

76
0:03:39.249,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Forty-five thousand Americans kill themselves every year;

77
0:03:41.948,000 --> 0:03:43,000
72,000 die from opioid addictions;

78
0:03:44.202,000 --> 0:03:47,000
life expectancy is falling, not rising.

79
0:03:48.985,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So what I mean to tell you, I flew out here to say

80
0:03:51.596,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that we have an economic crisis, we have environmental crisis,

81
0:03:54.548,000 --> 0:03:55,000
we have a political crisis.

82
0:03:55.937,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We also have a social and relational crisis;

83
0:03:58.04,000 --> 0:03:59,000
we're in the valley.

84
0:03:59.403,000 --> 0:04:,000
We're fragmented from each other,

85
0:04:01.03,000 --> 0:04:03,000
we've got cascades of lies coming out of Washington ...

86
0:04:03.646,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We're in the valley.

87
0:04:05.466,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And so I've spent the last five years --

88
0:04:07.467,000 --> 0:04:08,000
how do you get out of a valley?

89
0:04:09.356,000 --> 0:04:12,000
The Greeks used to say, "You suffer your way to wisdom."

90
0:04:13.006,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And from that dark period where I started, I've had a few realizations.

91
0:04:17.228,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The first is, freedom sucks.

92
0:04:20.998,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Economic freedom is OK, political freedom is great,

93
0:04:23.696,000 --> 0:04:24,000
social freedom sucks.

94
0:04:26.036,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The unrooted man is the adrift man.

95
0:04:28.387,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The unrooted man is the unremembered man, because he's uncommitted to things.

96
0:04:32.776,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Freedom is not an ocean you want to swim in,

97
0:04:36.334,000 --> 0:04:37,000
it's a river you want to get across,

98
0:04:38.088,000 --> 0:04:4,000
so you can commit and plant yourself on the other side.

99
0:04:41.27,000 --> 0:04:42,000
The second thing I learned

100
0:04:42.953,000 --> 0:04:44,000
is that when you have one of those bad moments in life,

101
0:04:45.573,000 --> 0:04:46,000
you can either be broken,

102
0:04:46.892,000 --> 0:04:47,000
or you can be broken open.

103
0:04:48.905,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And we all know people who are broken.

104
0:04:50.755,000 --> 0:04:52,000
They've endured some pain or grief, they get smaller,

105
0:04:53.295,000 --> 0:04:55,000
they get angrier, resentful, they lash out.

106
0:04:55.699,000 --> 0:04:56,000
As the saying is,

107
0:04:56.878,000 --> 0:04:58,000
"Pain that is not transformed gets transmitted."

108
0:04:59.927,000 --> 0:05:,000
But other people are broken open.

109
0:05:03.125,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Suffering's great power is that it's an interruption of life.

110
0:05:06.25,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It reminds you you're not the person you thought you were.

111
0:05:09.043,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The theologian Paul Tillich said

112
0:05:10.604,000 --> 0:05:13,000
what suffering does is it carves through what you thought was the floor

113
0:05:14.045,000 --> 0:05:15,000
of the basement of your soul,

114
0:05:15.452,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and it carves through that, revealing a cavity below,

115
0:05:17.986,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and it carves through that, revealing a cavity below.

116
0:05:20.502,000 --> 0:05:23,000
You realize there are depths of yourself you never anticipated,

117
0:05:23.535,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and only spiritual and relational food will fill those depths.

118
0:05:28.173,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And when you get down there, you get out of the head of the ego

119
0:05:31.165,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and you get into the heart,

120
0:05:32.871,000 --> 0:05:33,000
the desiring heart.

121
0:05:34.657,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The idea that what we really yearn for is longing and love for another,

122
0:05:38.312,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the kind of thing that Louis de Bernières described in his book,

123
0:05:41.382,000 --> 0:05:42,000
"Captain Corelli's Mandolin."

124
0:05:43.304,000 --> 0:05:44,000
He had an old guy talking to his daughter

125
0:05:45.307,000 --> 0:05:47,000
about his relationship with his late wife,

126
0:05:47.349,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and the old guy says,

127
0:05:48.76,000 --> 0:05:51,000
"Love itself is whatever is leftover when being in love is burned away.

128
0:05:52.482,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And this is both an art and a fortunate accident.

129
0:05:55.704,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Your mother and I had it.

130
0:05:57.411,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We had roots that grew towards each other underground,

131
0:05:59.974,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and when all the pretty blossoms had fallen from our branches,

132
0:06:02.927,000 --> 0:06:04,000
we discovered that we are one tree and not two."

133
0:06:05.696,000 --> 0:06:06,000
That's what the heart yearns for.

134
0:06:07.593,000 --> 0:06:09,000
The second thing you discover is your soul.

135
0:06:10.932,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Now, I don't ask you to believe in God or not believe in God,

136
0:06:13.834,000 --> 0:06:15,000
but I do ask you to believe that there's a piece of you

137
0:06:16.445,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that has no shape, size, color or weight,

138
0:06:18.445,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but that gives you infinite dignity and value.

139
0:06:21.395,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Rich and successful people don't have more of this

140
0:06:23.776,000 --> 0:06:24,000
than less successful people.

141
0:06:25.974,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Slavery is wrong because it's an obliteration of another soul.

142
0:06:29.18,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Rape is not just an attack on a bunch of physical molecules,

143
0:06:32.038,000 --> 0:06:34,000
it's an attempt to insult another person's soul.

144
0:06:34.99,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And what the soul does is it yearns for righteousness.

145
0:06:38.06,000 --> 0:06:41,000
The heart yearns for fusion with another, the soul yearns for righteousness.

146
0:06:41.663,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And that led to my third realization, which I borrowed from Einstein:

147
0:06:45.655,000 --> 0:06:47,000
"The problem you have is not going to be solved

148
0:06:48.165,000 --> 0:06:5,000
at the level of consciousness on which you created it.

149
0:06:50.903,000 --> 0:06:53,000
You have to expand to a different level of consciousness."

150
0:06:54.8,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So what do you do?

151
0:06:56.038,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Well, the first thing you do is you throw yourself on your friends

152
0:06:59.172,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and you have deeper conversations that you ever had before.

153
0:07:02.157,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But the second thing you do,

154
0:07:03.538,000 --> 0:07:05,000
you have to go out alone into the wilderness.

155
0:07:05.696,000 --> 0:07:08,000
You go out into that place where there's nobody there to perform,

156
0:07:08.792,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and the ego has nothing to do, and it crumbles,

157
0:07:11.196,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and only then are you capable of being loved.

158
0:07:13.712,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I have a friend who said that when her daughter was born,

159
0:07:17.073,000 --> 0:07:2,000
she realized that she loved her more than evolution required.

160
0:07:21.041,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Laughter)

161
0:07:22.208,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And I've always loved that.

162
0:07:23.637,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Applause)

163
0:07:24.803,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Because it talks about the peace that's at the deep of ourself,

164
0:07:27.784,000 --> 0:07:29,000
our inexplicable care for one another.

165
0:07:30.513,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And when you touch that spot, you're ready to be rescued.

166
0:07:33.815,000 --> 0:07:35,000
The hard thing about when you're in the valley

167
0:07:37.3,000 --> 0:07:38,000
is that you can't climb out;

168
0:07:38.672,000 --> 0:07:4,000
somebody has to reach in and pull you out.

169
0:07:41.331,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It happened to me.

170
0:07:42.51,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I got, luckily, invited over to a house by a couple named Kathy and David,

171
0:07:46.061,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and they were --

172
0:07:48.196,000 --> 0:07:5,000
They had a kid in the DC public school, his name's Santi.

173
0:07:50.895,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Santi had a friend who needed a place to stay

174
0:07:53.021,000 --> 0:07:54,000
because his mom had some health issues.

175
0:07:54.911,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And then that kid had a friend and that kid had a friend.

176
0:07:57.617,000 --> 0:07:59,000
When I went to their house six years ago,

177
0:07:59.649,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I walk in the door, there's like 25 around the kitchen table,

178
0:08:02.57,000 --> 0:08:04,000
a whole bunch sleeping downstairs in the basement.

179
0:08:04.943,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I reach out to introduce myself to a kid,

180
0:08:07.03,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and he says, "We don't really shake hands here.

181
0:08:10.331,000 --> 0:08:11,000
We just hug here."

182
0:08:12.323,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And I'm not the huggiest guy on the face of the earth,

183
0:08:15.323,000 --> 0:08:18,000
but I've been going back to that home every Thursday night when I'm in town,

184
0:08:18.926,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and just hugging all those kids.

185
0:08:20.494,000 --> 0:08:21,000
They demand intimacy.

186
0:08:22.403,000 --> 0:08:25,000
They demand that you behave in a way where you're showing all the way up.

187
0:08:26.442,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And they teach you a new way to live,

188
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
which is the cure for all the ills of our culture

189
0:08:30.585,000 --> 0:08:32,000
which is a way of direct -- really putting relationship first,

190
0:08:33.555,000 --> 0:08:36,000
not just as a word, but as a reality.

191
0:08:37.557,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And the beautiful thing is, these communities are everywhere.

192
0:08:41.652,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I started something at the Aspen Institute called "Weave: The Social Fabric."

193
0:08:45.323,000 --> 0:08:46,000
This is our logo here.

194
0:08:46.503,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And we plop into a place and we find weavers anywhere, everywhere.

195
0:08:50.761,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We find people like Asiaha Butler, who grew up in --

196
0:08:54.056,000 --> 0:08:56,000
who lived in Chicago, in Englewood, in a tough neighborhood.

197
0:08:56.897,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And she was about to move because it was so dangerous,

198
0:09:00.173,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and she looked across the street and she saw two little girls

199
0:09:03.065,000 --> 0:09:05,000
playing in an empty lot with broken bottles,

200
0:09:05.165,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and she turned to her husband and she said, "We're not leaving.

201
0:09:08.371,000 --> 0:09:1,000
We're not going to be just another family that abandon that."

202
0:09:11.371,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And she Googled "volunteer in Englewood," and now she runs R.A.G.E.,

203
0:09:14.603,000 --> 0:09:15,000
the big community organization there.

204
0:09:16.424,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Some of these people have had tough valleys.

205
0:09:19.427,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I met a woman named Sarah in Ohio who came home from an antiquing trip

206
0:09:23.156,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and found that her husband had killed himself and their two kids.

207
0:09:27.815,000 --> 0:09:3,000
She now runs a free pharmacy, she volunteers in the community,

208
0:09:31.219,000 --> 0:09:33,000
she helps women cope with violence, she teaches.

209
0:09:34.235,000 --> 0:09:37,000
She told me, "I grew from this experience because I was angry.

210
0:09:37.323,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I was going to fight back against what he tried to do to me

211
0:09:40.117,000 --> 0:09:41,000
by making a difference in the world.

212
0:09:41.887,000 --> 0:09:43,000
See, he didn't kill me.

213
0:09:43.966,000 --> 0:09:44,000
My response to him is,

214
0:09:45.175,000 --> 0:09:49,000
'Whatever you meant to do to me, screw you, you're not going to do it.'"

215
0:09:50.029,000 --> 0:09:53,000
These weavers are not living an individualistic life,

216
0:09:53.426,000 --> 0:09:56,000
they're living a relationist life, they have a different set of values.

217
0:09:56.823,000 --> 0:09:57,000
They have moral motivations.

218
0:09:58.267,000 --> 0:10:01,000
They have vocational certitude, they have planted themselves down.

219
0:10:01.419,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I met a guy in Youngstown, Ohio,

220
0:10:03.03,000 --> 0:10:05,000
who just held up a sign in the town square,

221
0:10:05.085,000 --> 0:10:06,000
"Defend Youngstown."

222
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
They have radical mutuality,

223
0:10:08.157,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and they are geniuses at relationship.

224
0:10:11.18,000 --> 0:10:12,000
There's a woman named Mary Gordon

225
0:10:12.879,000 --> 0:10:14,000
who runs something called Roots of Empathy.

226
0:10:15.026,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And what they do is they take a bunch of kids, an eighth grade class,

227
0:10:18.315,000 --> 0:10:19,000
they put a mom and an infant,

228
0:10:20.078,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and then the students have to guess what the infant is thinking,

229
0:10:23.126,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to teach empathy.

230
0:10:24.301,000 --> 0:10:27,000
There was one kid in a class who was bigger than the rest

231
0:10:27.431,000 --> 0:10:3,000
because he'd been held back, been through the foster care system,

232
0:10:31.038,000 --> 0:10:32,000
seen his mom get killed.

233
0:10:32.688,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And he wanted to hold the baby.

234
0:10:34.593,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And the mom was nervous because he looked big and scary.

235
0:10:37.252,000 --> 0:10:39,000
But she let this kid, Darren, hold the baby.

236
0:10:39.871,000 --> 0:10:4,000
He held it, and he was great with it.

237
0:10:43.014,000 --> 0:10:46,000
He gave the baby back and started asking questions about parenthood.

238
0:10:47.015,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And his final question was,

239
0:10:48.968,000 --> 0:10:51,000
"If nobody has ever loved you, do you think you can be a good father?"

240
0:10:52.642,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And so what Roots of Empathy does

241
0:10:54.333,000 --> 0:10:56,000
is they reach down and they grab people out of the valley.

242
0:10:57.077,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And that's what weavers are doing.

243
0:11:01.3,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Some of them switch jobs.

244
0:11:03.95,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Some of them stay in their same jobs.

245
0:11:06.982,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But one thing is, they have an intensity to them.

246
0:11:09.982,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I read this --

247
0:11:11.389,000 --> 0:11:16,000
E.O. Wilson wrote a great book called "Naturalist," about his childhood.

248
0:11:17.712,000 --> 0:11:19,000
When he was seven, his parents were divorcing.

249
0:11:21.291,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And they sent him to Paradise Beach in North Florida.

250
0:11:24.482,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And he'd never seen the ocean before.

251
0:11:26.731,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And he'd never seen a jellyfish before.

252
0:11:29.086,000 --> 0:11:33,000
He wrote, "The creature was astonishing. It existed beyond my imagination."

253
0:11:33.596,000 --> 0:11:34,000
He was sitting on the dock one day

254
0:11:35.281,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and he saw a stingray float beneath his feet.

255
0:11:38.365,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And at that moment, a naturalist was born in the awe and wonder.

256
0:11:42.469,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And he makes this observation:

257
0:11:44.638,000 --> 0:11:45,000
that when you're a child,

258
0:11:45.879,000 --> 0:11:48,000
you see animals at twice the size as you do as an adult.

259
0:11:50.162,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And that has always impressed me,

260
0:11:51.96,000 --> 0:11:55,000
because what we want as kids is that moral intensity,

261
0:11:56.744,000 --> 0:11:58,000
to be totally given ourselves over to something

262
0:11:59.712,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and to find that level of vocation.

263
0:12:02.48,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And when you are around these weavers,

264
0:12:04.473,000 --> 0:12:06,000
they see other people at twice the size as normal people.

265
0:12:07.465,000 --> 0:12:08,000
They see deeper into them.

266
0:12:09.997,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And what they see is joy.

267
0:12:13.315,000 --> 0:12:16,000
On the first mountain of our life, when we're shooting for our career,

268
0:12:16.743,000 --> 0:12:18,000
we shoot for happiness.

269
0:12:19.649,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And happiness is good, it's the expansion of self.

270
0:12:22.72,000 --> 0:12:23,000
You win a victory,

271
0:12:24.49,000 --> 0:12:27,000
you get a promotion, your team wins the Super Bowl,

272
0:12:28.507,000 --> 0:12:29,000
you're happy.

273
0:12:30.149,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Joy is not the expansion of self, it's the dissolving of self.

274
0:12:34.764,000 --> 0:12:38,000
It's the moment when the skin barrier disappears between a mother and her child,

275
0:12:39.026,000 --> 0:12:42,000
it's the moment when a naturalist feels just free in nature.

276
0:12:43.232,000 --> 0:12:45,000
It's the moment where you're so lost in your work or a cause,

277
0:12:46.201,000 --> 0:12:48,000
you have totally self-forgotten.

278
0:12:48.649,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And joy is a better thing to aim for than happiness.

279
0:12:51.559,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I collect passages of joy, of people when they lose it.

280
0:12:54.624,000 --> 0:12:56,000
One of my favorite is from Zadie Smith.

281
0:12:56.895,000 --> 0:12:59,000
In 1999, she was in a London nightclub,

282
0:13:00.229,000 --> 0:13:03,000
looking for her friends, wondering where her handbag was.

283
0:13:03.348,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And suddenly, as she writes,

284
0:13:05.475,000 --> 0:13:08,000
"... a rail-thin man with enormous eyes reached across a sea of bodies

285
0:13:08.821,000 --> 0:13:09,000
for my hand.

286
0:13:10.021,000 --> 0:13:13,000
He kept asking me the same thing over and over, 'Are you feeling it?'

287
0:13:13.784,000 --> 0:13:16,000
My ridiculous heels were killing me, I was terrified that I might die,

288
0:13:17.657,000 --> 0:13:19,000
yet I felt simultaneously overwhelmed with delight

289
0:13:20.129,000 --> 0:13:22,000
that 'Can I Kick It?' should happen to be playing

290
0:13:22.464,000 --> 0:13:24,000
on this precise moment in the history of the world

291
0:13:24.834,000 --> 0:13:25,000
on the sound system,

292
0:13:26.013,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and it was now morphing into 'Teen Spirit.'

293
0:13:28.165,000 --> 0:13:31,000
I took the man's hand, the top of my head blew away,

294
0:13:31.347,000 --> 0:13:34,000
we danced, we danced, we gave ourselves up to joy."

295
0:13:35.68,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And so what I'm trying to describe is two different life mindsets.

296
0:13:39.998,000 --> 0:13:43,000
The first mountain mindset, which is about individual happiness and career success.

297
0:13:44.49,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And it's a good mindset, I have nothing against it.

298
0:13:47.077,000 --> 0:13:49,000
But we're in a national valley,

299
0:13:49.395,000 --> 0:13:51,000
because we don't have the other mindset to balance it.

300
0:13:52.252,000 --> 0:13:54,000
We no longer feel good about ourselves as a people,

301
0:13:54.839,000 --> 0:13:56,000
we've lost our defining faith in our future,

302
0:13:57.553,000 --> 0:14:,000
we don't see each other deeply, we don't treat each other as well.

303
0:14:01.538,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And we need a lot of changes.

304
0:14:03.553,000 --> 0:14:05,000
We need an economic change and environmental change.

305
0:14:06.902,000 --> 0:14:08,000
But we also need a cultural and relational revolution.

306
0:14:09.871,000 --> 0:14:13,000
We need to name the language of a recovered society.

307
0:14:14.553,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And to me, the weavers have found that language.

308
0:14:17.593,000 --> 0:14:2,000
My theory of social change is that society changes

309
0:14:20.718,000 --> 0:14:22,000
when a small group of people find a better way to live,

310
0:14:23.387,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and the rest of us copy them.

311
0:14:25.765,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And these weavers have found a better way to live.

312
0:14:28.427,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And you don't have to theorize about it.

313
0:14:30.404,000 --> 0:14:33,000
They are out there as community builders all around the country.

314
0:14:34.277,000 --> 0:14:36,000
We just have to shift our lives a little,

315
0:14:36.578,000 --> 0:14:38,000
so we can say, "I'm a weaver, we're a weaver."

316
0:14:39.999,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And if we do that,

317
0:14:42.079,000 --> 0:14:44,000
the hole inside ourselves gets filled,

318
0:14:44.452,000 --> 0:14:46,000
but more important, the social unity gets repaired.

319
0:14:47.301,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Thank you very much.

320
0:14:48.492,000 --> 0:14:52,000

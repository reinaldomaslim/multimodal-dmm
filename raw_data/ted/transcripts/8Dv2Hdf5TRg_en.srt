1
0:00:13.622,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Today I want to confess something to you,

2
0:00:16.97,000 --> 0:00:18,000
but first of all I'm going to ask you a couple of questions.

3
0:00:19.889,000 --> 0:00:2,000
How many people here have children?

4
0:00:23.496,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And how many of you are confident

5
0:00:25.098,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that you know how to bring up your children

6
0:00:27.176,000 --> 0:00:28,000
in exactly the right way?

7
0:00:28.435,000 --> 0:00:31,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:31.9,000 --> 0:00:34,000
OK, I don't see too many hands going up on that second one,

9
0:00:35.063,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and that's my confession, too.

10
0:00:36.634,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I've got three boys;

11
0:00:37.909,000 --> 0:00:38,000
they're three, nine and 12.

12
0:00:39.74,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And like you, and like most parents,

13
0:00:41.83,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the honest truth is I have pretty much no idea what I'm doing.

14
0:00:45.469,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I want them to be happy and healthy in their lives,

15
0:00:47.898,000 --> 0:00:48,000
but I don't know what I'm supposed to do

16
0:00:49.908,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to make sure they are happy and healthy.

17
0:00:51.938,000 --> 0:00:53,000
There's so many books offering all kinds of conflicting advice,

18
0:00:54.939,000 --> 0:00:55,000
it can be really overwhelming.

19
0:00:56.499,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So I've spent most of their lives just making it up as I go along.

20
0:01:00.854,000 --> 0:01:03,000
However, something changed me a few years ago,

21
0:01:03.894,000 --> 0:01:05,000
when I came across a little secret that we have in Britain.

22
0:01:07.185,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It's helped me become more confident about how I bring up my own children,

23
0:01:10.69,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and it's revealed a lot about how we as a society can help all children.

24
0:01:14.624,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I want to share that secret with you today.

25
0:01:17.948,000 --> 0:01:18,000
For the last 70 years,

26
0:01:19.909,000 --> 0:01:23,000
scientists in Britain have been following thousands of children through their lives

27
0:01:24.41,000 --> 0:01:26,000
as part of an incredible scientific study.

28
0:01:27.291,000 --> 0:01:29,000
There's nothing quite like it anywhere else in the world.

29
0:01:30.732,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Collecting information on thousands of children

30
0:01:32.948,000 --> 0:01:33,000
is a really powerful thing to do,

31
0:01:34.545,000 --> 0:01:36,000
because it means we can compare the ones who say,

32
0:01:36.856,000 --> 0:01:39,000
do well at school or end up healthy or happy or wealthy as adults,

33
0:01:40.29,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and the ones who struggle much more,

34
0:01:42.102,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and then we can sift through all the information we've collected

35
0:01:45.127,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and try to work out why their lives turned out different.

36
0:01:48.051,000 --> 0:01:5,000
This British study -- it's actually a kind of crazy story.

37
0:01:51.031,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So it all starts back in 1946,

38
0:01:53.46,000 --> 0:01:55,000
just a few months after the end of the war,

39
0:01:55.725,000 --> 0:01:56,000
when scientists wanted to know

40
0:01:57.18,000 --> 0:01:59,000
what it was like for a woman to have a baby at the time.

41
0:02:00.572,000 --> 0:02:02,000
They carried out this huge survey of mothers

42
0:02:03.003,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and ended up recording the birth of nearly every baby

43
0:02:05.972,000 --> 0:02:07,000
born in England, Scotland and Wales in one week.

44
0:02:08.947,000 --> 0:02:1,000
That was nearly 14,000 babies.

45
0:02:12.324,000 --> 0:02:13,000
The questions they asked these women

46
0:02:14.111,000 --> 0:02:16,000
are very different than the ones we might ask today.

47
0:02:16.597,000 --> 0:02:17,000
They sound really old-fashioned now.

48
0:02:18.347,000 --> 0:02:19,000
They asked them things like,

49
0:02:19.706,000 --> 0:02:2,000
"During pregnancy,

50
0:02:20.936,000 --> 0:02:23,000
did you get your full extra ration of a pint of milk a day?"

51
0:02:25.276,000 --> 0:02:28,000
"How much did you spend on smocks, corsets,

52
0:02:28.618,000 --> 0:02:3,000
nightdresses, knickers and brassieres?"

53
0:02:32.658,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And this is my favorite one:

54
0:02:34.249,000 --> 0:02:37,000
"Who looked after your husband while you were in bed with this baby?"

55
0:02:37.525,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:42.068,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Now, this wartime study actually ended up being so successful

57
0:02:45.487,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that scientists did it again.

58
0:02:47.28,000 --> 0:02:5,000
They recorded the births of thousands of babies born in 1958

59
0:02:50.643,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and thousands more in 1970.

60
0:02:52.916,000 --> 0:02:54,000
They did it again in the early 1990s,

61
0:02:54.942,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and again at the turn of the millennium.

62
0:02:57.014,000 --> 0:03:,000
Altogether, more than 70,000 children have been involved in these studies

63
0:03:00.704,000 --> 0:03:02,000
across those five generations.

64
0:03:02.741,000 --> 0:03:04,000
They're called the British birth cohorts,

65
0:03:04.956,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and scientists have gone back and recorded more information

66
0:03:07.743,000 --> 0:03:09,000
on all of these people every few years ever since.

67
0:03:10.911,000 --> 0:03:13,000
The amount of information that's now been collected on these people

68
0:03:14.111,000 --> 0:03:15,000
is just completely mind-boggling.

69
0:03:15.715,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It includes thousands of paper questionnaires

70
0:03:17.929,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and terabytes' worth of computer data.

71
0:03:20.293,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Scientists have also built up a huge bank of tissue samples,

72
0:03:23.143,000 --> 0:03:27,000
which includes locks of hair, nail clippings, baby teeth and DNA.

73
0:03:28.318,000 --> 0:03:32,000
They've even collected 9,000 placentas from some of the births,

74
0:03:32.897,000 --> 0:03:36,000
which are now pickled in plastic buckets in a secure storage warehouse.

75
0:03:38.384,000 --> 0:03:39,000
This whole project has become unique --

76
0:03:40.304,000 --> 0:03:43,000
so, no other country in the world is tracking generations of children

77
0:03:43.664,000 --> 0:03:44,000
in quite this detail.

78
0:03:45.589,000 --> 0:03:48,000
These are some of the best-studied people on the planet,

79
0:03:48.644,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and the data has become incredibly valuable for scientists,

80
0:03:51.772,000 --> 0:03:54,000
generating well over 6,000 academic papers and books.

81
0:03:56.525,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But today I want to focus on just one finding --

82
0:03:59.408,000 --> 0:04:03,000
perhaps the most important discovery to come from this remarkable study.

83
0:04:03.766,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And it's also the one that spoke to me personally,

84
0:04:06.128,000 --> 0:04:09,000
because it's about how to use science to do the best for our children.

85
0:04:10.408,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So, let's get the bad news out of the way first.

86
0:04:14.026,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Perhaps the biggest message from this remarkable study is this:

87
0:04:17.957,000 --> 0:04:2,000
don't be born into poverty or into disadvantage,

88
0:04:21.196,000 --> 0:04:22,000
because if you are,

89
0:04:22.434,000 --> 0:04:24,000
you're far more likely to walk a difficult path in life.

90
0:04:25.923,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Many children in this study were born into poor families

91
0:04:28.829,000 --> 0:04:32,000
or into working-class families that had cramped homes or other problems,

92
0:04:33.18,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and it's clear now that those disadvantaged children

93
0:04:35.682,000 --> 0:04:38,000
have been more likely to struggle on almost every score.

94
0:04:38.798,000 --> 0:04:4,000
They've been more likely to do worse at school,

95
0:04:41.172,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to end up with worse jobs and to earn less money.

96
0:04:43.951,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Now, maybe that sounds really obvious,

97
0:04:45.982,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but some of the results have been really surprising,

98
0:04:48.701,000 --> 0:04:49,000
so children who had a tough start in life

99
0:04:50.678,000 --> 0:04:52,000
are also more likely to end up unhealthy as adults.

100
0:04:53.545,000 --> 0:04:54,000
They're more likely to be overweight,

101
0:04:55.336,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to have high blood pressure,

102
0:04:56.695,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and then decades down the line,

103
0:04:58.812,000 --> 0:05:02,000
more likely to have a failing memory, poor health and even to die earlier.

104
0:05:05.597,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Now, I talked about what happens later,

105
0:05:08.534,000 --> 0:05:11,000
but some of these differences emerge at a really shockingly early age.

106
0:05:12.221,000 --> 0:05:13,000
In one study,

107
0:05:13.533,000 --> 0:05:14,000
children who were growing up in poverty

108
0:05:15.452,000 --> 0:05:18,000
were almost a year behind the richer children on educational tests,

109
0:05:19.337,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and that was by the age of just three.

110
0:05:22.319,000 --> 0:05:25,000
These types of differences have been found again and again across the generations.

111
0:05:26.201,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It means that our early circumstances have a profound influence

112
0:05:29.495,000 --> 0:05:31,000
on the way that the rest of our lives play out.

113
0:05:32.164,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And working out why that is

114
0:05:33.618,000 --> 0:05:35,000
is one of the most difficult questions that we face today.

115
0:05:37.653,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So there we have it.

116
0:05:39.334,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The first lesson for successful life, everyone, is this:

117
0:05:42.034,000 --> 0:05:43,000
choose your parents very carefully.

118
0:05:43.914,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Laughter)

119
0:05:44.939,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Don't be born into a poor family or into a struggling family.

120
0:05:49.189,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Now, I'm sure you can see the small problem here.

121
0:05:51.95,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We can't choose our parents or how much they earn,

122
0:05:55.412,000 --> 0:05:58,000
but this British study has also struck a real note of optimism

123
0:05:58.665,000 --> 0:06:01,000
by showing that not everyone who has a disadvantaged start

124
0:06:02.04,000 --> 0:06:04,000
ends up in difficult circumstances.

125
0:06:05.166,000 --> 0:06:07,000
As you know, many people have a tough start in life,

126
0:06:07.643,000 --> 0:06:09,000
but they end up doing very well on some measure nevertheless,

127
0:06:10.526,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and this study starts to explain how.

128
0:06:13.157,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So the second lesson is this:

129
0:06:15.282,000 --> 0:06:16,000
parents really matter.

130
0:06:17.727,000 --> 0:06:18,000
In this study,

131
0:06:18.902,000 --> 0:06:2,000
children who had engaged, interested parents,

132
0:06:21.044,000 --> 0:06:23,000
ones who had ambition for their future,

133
0:06:23.132,000 --> 0:06:25,000
were more likely to escape from a difficult start.

134
0:06:25.99,000 --> 0:06:29,000
It seems that parents and what they do are really, really important,

135
0:06:30.039,000 --> 0:06:32,000
especially in the first few years of life.

136
0:06:32.747,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Let me give you an example of that.

137
0:06:34.439,000 --> 0:06:35,000
In one study,

138
0:06:35.657,000 --> 0:06:39,000
scientists looked at about 17,000 children who were born in 1970.

139
0:06:40.599,000 --> 0:06:42,000
They sifted all the mountains of data that they had collected

140
0:06:43.57,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to try to work out

141
0:06:44.821,000 --> 0:06:46,000
what allowed the children who'd had a difficult start in life

142
0:06:47.726,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to go on and do well at school nevertheless.

143
0:06:49.873,000 --> 0:06:51,000
In other words, which ones beat the odds.

144
0:06:52.25,000 --> 0:06:55,000
The data showed that what mattered more than anything else was parents.

145
0:06:56.021,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Having engaged, interested parents in those first few years of life

146
0:06:59.643,000 --> 0:07:02,000
was strongly linked to children going on to do well at school later on.

147
0:07:04.058,000 --> 0:07:06,000
In fact, quite small things that parents do

148
0:07:07.048,000 --> 0:07:09,000
are associated with good outcomes for children.

149
0:07:10.19,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Talking and listening to a child,

150
0:07:12.119,000 --> 0:07:13,000
responding to them warmly,

151
0:07:14.047,000 --> 0:07:15,000
teaching them their letters and numbers,

152
0:07:16.039,000 --> 0:07:17,000
taking them on trips and visits.

153
0:07:17.735,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Reading to children every day seems to be really important, too.

154
0:07:21.324,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So in one study,

155
0:07:22.736,000 --> 0:07:25,000
children whose parents were reading to them daily when they were five

156
0:07:26.047,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and then showing an interest in their education at the age of 10,

157
0:07:29.12,000 --> 0:07:33,000
were significantly less likely to be in poverty at the age of 30

158
0:07:33.165,000 --> 0:07:35,000
than those whose parents weren't doing those things.

159
0:07:36.931,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Now, there are huge challenges with interpreting this type of science.

160
0:07:41.501,000 --> 0:07:43,000
These studies show that certain things that parents do

161
0:07:44.18,000 --> 0:07:46,000
are correlated with good outcomes for children,

162
0:07:46.566,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but we don't necessarily know those behaviors caused the good outcomes,

163
0:07:50.003,000 --> 0:07:52,000
or whether some other factor is getting in the way.

164
0:07:52.409,000 --> 0:07:54,000
For example, we have to take genes into account,

165
0:07:54.678,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and that's a whole other talk in itself.

166
0:07:57.309,000 --> 0:07:59,000
But scientists working with this British study

167
0:07:59.556,000 --> 0:08:01,000
are working really hard to get at causes,

168
0:08:01.746,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and this is one study I particularly love.

169
0:08:03.791,000 --> 0:08:04,000
In this one,

170
0:08:04.997,000 --> 0:08:06,000
they looked at the bedtime routines of about 10,000 children

171
0:08:07.888,000 --> 0:08:08,000
born at the turn of the millennium.

172
0:08:09.704,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Were the children going to bed at regular times,

173
0:08:12.057,000 --> 0:08:14,000
or did they go to bed at different times during the week?

174
0:08:14.979,000 --> 0:08:17,000
The data showed that those children who were going to bed at different times

175
0:08:18.576,000 --> 0:08:2,000
were more likely to have behavioral problems,

176
0:08:20.973,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and then those that switched to having regular bedtimes

177
0:08:23.706,000 --> 0:08:25,000
often showed an improvement in behavior,

178
0:08:26.116,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and that was really crucial,

179
0:08:27.496,000 --> 0:08:29,000
because it suggested it was the bedtime routines

180
0:08:29.792,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that were really helping things get better for those kids.

181
0:08:33.081,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Here's another one to think about.

182
0:08:34.726,000 --> 0:08:35,000
In this one,

183
0:08:35.908,000 --> 0:08:37,000
scientists looked at children who were reading for pleasure.

184
0:08:38.823,000 --> 0:08:42,000
That means that they picked up a magazine, a picture book, a story book.

185
0:08:43.626,000 --> 0:08:45,000
The data showed that children who were reading for pleasure

186
0:08:46.423,000 --> 0:08:48,000
at the ages of five and 10

187
0:08:48.707,000 --> 0:08:5,000
were more likely to go on in school better, on average,

188
0:08:51.627,000 --> 0:08:52,000
on school tests later in their lives.

189
0:08:53.622,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And not just tests of reading,

190
0:08:55.351,000 --> 0:08:57,000
but tests of spelling and maths as well.

191
0:08:58.325,000 --> 0:09:,000
This study tried to control for all the confounding factors,

192
0:09:01.159,000 --> 0:09:03,000
so it looked at children who were equally intelligent

193
0:09:03.667,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and from the same social-class background,

194
0:09:05.723,000 --> 0:09:08,000
so it seemed as if it was the reading which really helped those children

195
0:09:09.13,000 --> 0:09:12,000
go on and score better on those school tests later in their lives.

196
0:09:13.597,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Now at the start,

197
0:09:14.771,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I said the first lesson from this study

198
0:09:16.744,000 --> 0:09:18,000
was not to be born into poverty or into disadvantage,

199
0:09:19.316,000 --> 0:09:22,000
because those children tend to follow more difficult paths in their lives.

200
0:09:22.892,000 --> 0:09:24,000
But then I said that parenting matters,

201
0:09:25.153,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and that good parenting, if you can call it that,

202
0:09:27.479,000 --> 0:09:28,000
helps children beat the odds

203
0:09:28.839,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and overcome some of those early disadvantages.

204
0:09:31.666,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So wait,

205
0:09:33.015,000 --> 0:09:36,000
does that actually mean, then, that poverty doesn't matter after all?

206
0:09:38.036,000 --> 0:09:41,000
You could argue it doesn't matter if a child is born poor --

207
0:09:41.072,000 --> 0:09:44,000
as long as their parents are good parents, they're going to do just fine.

208
0:09:44.817,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I don't believe that's true.

209
0:09:46.248,000 --> 0:09:48,000
This study shows that poverty and parenting matter.

210
0:09:49.258,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And one study actually put figures on that,

211
0:09:51.282,000 --> 0:09:53,000
so it looked at children growing up in persistent poverty

212
0:09:54.005,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and how well they were doing at school.

213
0:09:56.416,000 --> 0:09:57,000
The data showed

214
0:09:57.591,000 --> 0:09:59,000
that even when their parents were doing everything right --

215
0:10:00.471,000 --> 0:10:01,000
putting them to bed on time

216
0:10:01.797,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and reading to them every day and everything else --

217
0:10:04.258,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that only got those children so far.

218
0:10:06.43,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Good parenting only reduced the educational gap

219
0:10:09.423,000 --> 0:10:12,000
between the rich and poor children by about 50 percent.

220
0:10:13.292,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Now that means that poverty leaves a really lasting scar,

221
0:10:17.467,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and it means that if we really want to ensure the success and well-being

222
0:10:20.873,000 --> 0:10:21,000
of the next generation,

223
0:10:22.334,000 --> 0:10:25,000
then tackling child poverty is an incredibly important thing to do.

224
0:10:27.702,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Now, what does all this mean for you and me?

225
0:10:30.114,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Are there lessons here we can all take home and use?

226
0:10:32.568,000 --> 0:10:33,000
As a scientist and a journalist,

227
0:10:34.122,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I like to have some science to inform my parenting ...

228
0:10:37.732,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and I can tell you that when you're shouting at your kids

229
0:10:40.513,000 --> 0:10:41,000
to go to bed on time,

230
0:10:41.797,000 --> 0:10:44,000
it really helps to have the scientific literature on your side.

231
0:10:44.853,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Laughter)

232
0:10:45.896,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And wouldn't it be great to think

233
0:10:47.523,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that all we had to do to have happy, successful children

234
0:10:50.256,000 --> 0:10:52,000
was to talk to them, be interested in their future,

235
0:10:52.979,000 --> 0:10:54,000
put them to bed on time, and give them a book to read?

236
0:10:55.577,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Our job would be done.

237
0:10:57.189,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Now, as you can imagine,

238
0:10:58.682,000 --> 0:11:01,000
the answers aren't quite as simple as that.

239
0:11:01.915,000 --> 0:11:03,000
For one thing, this study looks at what happens

240
0:11:04.13,000 --> 0:11:06,000
to thousands and thousands of children on average,

241
0:11:06.575,000 --> 0:11:09,000
but that doesn't necessarily say what will help my child or your child

242
0:11:10.197,000 --> 0:11:11,000
or any individual child.

243
0:11:11.958,000 --> 0:11:14,000
In the end, each of our children is going to walk their own path,

244
0:11:15.19,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and that's partly defined by the genes they inherit

245
0:11:17.793,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and of course all the experiences they have through their lives,

246
0:11:20.818,000 --> 0:11:22,000
including their interactions with us, their parents.

247
0:11:23.294,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I will tell you what I did after I learned all this.

248
0:11:25.773,000 --> 0:11:26,000
It's a bit embarrassing.

249
0:11:27.772,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I realized I was so busy working,

250
0:11:30.269,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and ironically,

251
0:11:31.452,000 --> 0:11:34,000
learning and writing about this incredible study of British children,

252
0:11:35.06,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that there were days when I hardly even spoke to my own British children.

253
0:11:39.266,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So at home, we introduced talking time,

254
0:11:41.544,000 --> 0:11:43,000
which is just 15 minutes at the end of the day

255
0:11:43.712,000 --> 0:11:45,000
when we talk and listen to the boys.

256
0:11:46.527,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I try better now to ask them what they did today,

257
0:11:49.862,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and to show that I value what they do at school.

258
0:11:52.805,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Of course, I make sure they always have a book to read.

259
0:11:55.471,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I tell them I'm ambitious for their future,

260
0:11:57.74,000 --> 0:12:,000
and I think they can be happy and do great things.

261
0:12:01.829,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I don't know that any of that will make a difference,

262
0:12:04.635,000 --> 0:12:06,000
but I'm pretty confident it won't do them any harm,

263
0:12:07.049,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and it might even do them some good.

264
0:12:09.555,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Ultimately, if we want happy children,

265
0:12:12.423,000 --> 0:12:14,000
all we can do is listen to the science,

266
0:12:14.487,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and of course,

267
0:12:15.677,000 --> 0:12:16,000
listen to our children themselves.

268
0:12:17.527,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Thank you.

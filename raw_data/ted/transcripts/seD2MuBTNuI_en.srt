1
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I draw to better understand things.

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Sometimes I make a lot of drawings

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and I still don't understand what it is I'm drawing.

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Those of you who are comfortable with digital stuff

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and even smug about that relationship might be amused to know

6
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that the guy who is best known for "The Way Things Work,"

7
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
while preparing for part of a panel for called Understanding,

8
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
spent two days trying to get his laptop to communicate with his new CD burner.

9
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Who knew about extension managers?

10
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I've always managed my own extensions

11
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
so it never even occurred to me to read the instructions,

12
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
but I did finally figure it out. I had to figure it out,

13
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
because along with the invitation

14
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector,

15
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
so bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary

16
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but some alternate form of communication would.

17
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now, I could talk about something that I'm known for,

18
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
something that would be particularly appropriate

19
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
for many of the more technically minded people here,

20
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
or I could talk about something I really care about.

21
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I decided to go with the latter.

22
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I'm going to talk about Rome.

23
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Now, why would I care about Rome, particularly?

24
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Well, I went to Rhode Island School of Design

25
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
in the second half of the '60s to study architecture.

26
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I was lucky enough to spend my last year, my fifth year,

27
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
in Rome as a student. It changed my life.

28
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Not the least reason was the fact that I had spent those first four years living at home,

29
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
driving into RISD everyday, driving back.

30
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I missed the '60s. I read about them; (Laughter)

31
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
I understand they were pretty interesting. I missed them,

32
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but I did spend that extraordinary year in Rome,

33
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and it's a place that is never far from my mind.

34
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So, whenever given an opportunity,

35
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I try to do something in it or with it or for it.

36
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I also make drawings to help people understand things.

37
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Things that I want them to believe I understand.

38
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And that's what I do as an illustrator,

39
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that's my job.

40
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So, I'm going to show you some pictures of Rome.

41
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I've made a lot of drawings of Rome over the years.

42
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
These are just drawings of Rome. I get back as often as possible --

43
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I need to.

44
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
All different materials, all different styles, all different times,

45
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
drawings from sketchbooks looking at the details of Rome.

46
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Part of the reason I'm showing you these

47
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is that it sort of helps illustrate this process I go through

48
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
of trying to figure out what it is I feel about Rome and why I feel it.

49
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
These are sketches of some of the little details.

50
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Rome is a city full of surprises.

51
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I mean, we're talking about unusual perspectives,

52
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
we're talking about narrow little winding streets

53
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that suddenly open into vast, sun-drenched piazzas --

54
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
never, though, piazzas that are not humanly scaled.

55
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Part of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organically.

56
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
That amazing juxtaposition of old and new,

57
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
the bits of light that come down between the buildings

58
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that sort of create a map that's traveling above your head of

59
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
usually blue -- especially in the summer --

60
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
compared to the map that you would normally expect to see

61
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
of conventional streets.

62
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And I began to think about how I could communicate this in book form.

63
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
How could I share my sense of Rome,

64
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
my understanding of Rome?

65
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And I'm going to show you a bunch of dead ends, basically.

66
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
The primary reason for all these dead ends is when

67
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
if you're not quite sure where you're going, you're certainly not going to get there

68
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
with any kind of efficiency.

69
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Here's a little map. And I thought of maps at the beginning;

70
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
maybe I should just try and do a little atlas

71
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
of my favorite streets and connections in Rome.

72
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And here's a line of text that actually evolves

73
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
from the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the page.

74
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Here that same line of text wraps around a fountain

75
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways.

76
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Maybe that line of text could be a story

77
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to help give some human aspect to this.

78
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Maybe I should get away from this map completely,

79
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of Rome

80
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and simply kick a soccer ball in the air --

81
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
which happens in so many of the squares in the city --

82
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and let it bounce off of things. And I'll simply explain

83
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits.

84
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
That seemed like a sort of a cheap shot.

85
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
But even though I just started this presentation,

86
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
this is not the first thing that I tried to do

87
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and I was getting sort of desperate.

88
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Eventually, I realized that I had really no content that I could count on,

89
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
so I decided to move towards packaging. (Laughter)

90
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I mean, it seems to work for a lot of things.

91
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So I thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick.

92
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But one of the ideas that emerged

93
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
from some of those sketches was the notion of traveling through Rome

94
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
in different vehicles at different speeds in order

95
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to show the different aspects of Rome.

96
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Sort of an overview of Rome and the plan that you might see from a dirigible.

97
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Quick snapshots of things you might see

98
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
from a speeding motor scooter, and very slow

99
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
walking through Rome, you might be able to study in more detail

100
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
some of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across.

101
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Anyways, I went back to the dirigible notion.

102
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Went to Alberto Santos-Dumont.

103
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Found one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions

104
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
so I could actually use it as a scale

105
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that I would then juxtapose with some of the things in Rome.

106
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
This thing would be flying over or past

107
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
or be parked in front of, but it would be like having a ruler --

108
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
sort of travel through the pages without being a ruler.

109
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Not that you know how long number 11 actually is,

110
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
but you would be able to compare number 11 against the Pantheon

111
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
with number 11 against the Baths of Caracalla,

112
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and so on and so forth. If you were interested.

113
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
This is Beatrix. She has a dog named Ajax,

114
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
she has purchased a dirigible -- a small dirigible --

115
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
she's assembling the structure,

116
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Ajax is sniffing for holes in the balloon before they set off.

117
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
She launches this thing above the Spanish Steps

118
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and sets off for an aerial tour of the city.

119
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Over the Spanish Steps we go.

120
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
A nice way to show that river, that stream sort of pouring down the hill.

121
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Unfortunately, just across the road from it

122
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
or quite close by is the Column of Marcus Aurelius,

123
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression,

124
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
as you can see, as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around

125
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
the Column of Marcus Aurelius -- gets a little too close, nudges it.

126
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
This gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure

127
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
of the Column of Marcus Aurelius,

128
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
which is really no more than a pile of quarters

129
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
high -- thick quarters. Over the Piazza of Saint Ignacio,

130
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
completely ruining the symmetry, but that aside

131
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
a spectacular place to visit.

132
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
A spectacular framework, inside of which you see, usually,

133
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
extraordinary blue sky.

134
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Over the Pantheon and the 26-foot diameter Oculus.

135
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
She parks her dirigible, lowers the anchor rope

136
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and climbs down for a closer look inside.

137
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced

138
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to turn the book around, and you can see it from ground point of view

139
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and from her point of view -- looking in the hole,

140
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
getting a different kind of perspective,

141
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
moving you around the space. Particularly appropriate in a building

142
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that can contain perfectly a sphere

143
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
dimensions of the diameter being the same

144
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the Oculus.

145
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Unfortunately for her, the anchor line gets tangled

146
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
around the feet of some Boy Scouts who are visiting the Pantheon,

147
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and they are immediately yanked out

148
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and given an extraordinary but terrifying tour

149
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
of some of the domes of Rome, which would,

150
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
from their point of view, naturally be hanging upside down.

151
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
They bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint Ivo,

152
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that little spiral structure you see there.

153
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
She continues on her way over Piazza Navona.

154
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Notices a lot of activity at the Tre Scalini restaurant,

155
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
is reminded that it is lunchtime and she's hungry.

156
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
They keep on motoring towards the Campo de' Fiori,

157
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
which they soon reach. Ajax the dog is put in a basket

158
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and lowered with a list of food into the marketplace,

159
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon,

160
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and then is completely removed

161
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and doesn't appear again until six or seven the following morning.

162
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Anyway, the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff.

163
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Unfortunately, when she goes to unwrap the prosciutto,

164
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Ajax makes a lunge for it.

165
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
She's managed to save the prosciutto,

166
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
but in the process she loses the tablecloth,

167
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
which you can see flying away in the upper left-hand corner.

168
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
They continue without their tablecloth,

169
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch.

170
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
They eventually discover a huge wall

171
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that's filled with small holes, ideal for docking a dirigible

172
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
because you've got a place to tie up.

173
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Turns out to be the exterior wall --

174
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that part of it that remains -- of the Coliseum,

175
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch

176
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and have a spectacular view.

177
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
At the end of lunch, they untie the anchor, they set off

178
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
through the Baths of Caracalla and over the walls of the city

179
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and then an abandoned gatehouse

180
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and decide to take one more look at the Pyramid of Cestius,

181
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
which has this lightning rod on top.

182
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Unfortunately, that's a problem: they get a little too close,

183
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and when you're in a dirigible

184
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
you have to be very careful about spikes.

185
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion.

186
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Marcello, on the other hand, is sort of a lazy guy,

187
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
but he's not due at work until about noon.

188
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So, the alarm goes off and it's five to 12 or so.

189
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
He gets up, leaps onto his scooter, races through the city

190
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
past the church of Santa Maria della Pace,

191
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
down the alleys, through the streets

192
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that tourists may be wandering through,

193
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
disturbing the quiet backstreet life of Rome at every turn.

194
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
That speed with which he is moving, I hope I have suggested in this little image,

195
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
which, again, can be turned around and read from both sides

196
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
because there's text on the bottom and text on the top,

197
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
one of which is upside down in this image.

198
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So, he keeps on moving, approaching an unsuspecting waiter

199
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine

200
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
in a delicate white wine clam sauce

201
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
to diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street.

202
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Waiter catches on, but it's too late.

203
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And Marcello keeps moving in his scooter.

204
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine,

205
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
but keeps on moving because this guy's got a job to do.

206
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Removes some scaffolding. One of the reasons

207
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Rome remains the extraordinary place it is that

208
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
because of scaffolding and the determination

209
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to maintain the fabric, it is a city that continues

210
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
to grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time

211
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
in which it finds itself, or we find it.

212
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Right through the Piazza della Rotonda,

213
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
in front of the Pantheon -- again wreaking havoc -- and finally getting to work.

214
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Marcello, as it turns out,

215
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
is the driver of the number 64 bus,

216
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and if you've been on the number 64 bus, you know

217
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
that it's driven with the same kind of exuberance

218
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
as Marcello demonstrated on his scooter.

219
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And finally Carletto. You see his apartment in the upper left-hand corner.

220
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
He's looking at his table;

221
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
he's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of 40 years, (Laughter)

222
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and he wants it to be perfect.

223
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
He's got candles out, he's got flowers in the middle

224
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and he's trying to figure out where to put the plates and the glasses.

225
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
But he's not happy; something's wrong.

226
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
The phone rings anyway, he's called to the palazzo.

227
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
He saunters -- he saunters at a good clip,

228
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
but as compared to all the traveling we've just seen, he's sauntering.

229
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Everybody knows Carletto, because he's in entertainment,

230
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
actually; he's in television.

231
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
He's actually in television repair, which is why people know him.

232
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
So they all have his number.

233
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
He arrives at the palazzo, arrives at the big front door.

234
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Enters the courtyard and talks to the custodian,

235
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
who tells him that there's been a disaster in the palazzo;

236
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
nobody's TVs are working

237
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and there's a big soccer game coming up,

238
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous.

239
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
He goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring,

240
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building,

241
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
apartment by apartment, checking every television,

242
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
checking every connection,

243
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
hoping to find out what this problem is.

244
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
He works his way up, finally, the grand staircase

245
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and then a smaller staircase until he reaches the attic.

246
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
He opens the window of the attic, of course, and there's a tablecloth

247
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
wrapped around the building's television antenna.

248
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
He removes it, the problems are solved,

249
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
everybody in the palazzo is happy.

250
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And of course, he also solves his own problem.

251
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
All he has to do now, with a perfect table,

252
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
is wait for her to arrive.

253
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
That was the first attempt, but it didn't seem substantial enough

254
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
to convey whatever it was I wanted to convey about Rome.

255
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So I thought, well, I'll just do piazzas,

256
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and I'll get inside and underneath

257
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and I'll show these things growing

258
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and show why they're shaped the way they are and so on.

259
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And then I thought, that's too complicated. No,

260
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
I'll just take my favorite bits and pieces

261
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and I'll put them inside the Pantheon but keep the scale,

262
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
so you can see the top of Sant'Ivo and the Pyramid of Cestius

263
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and the Tempietto of Bramante all side by side in this amazing space.

264
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Now that's one drawing,

265
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
so I thought maybe it's time for Piranesi to meet Escher. (Laughter)

266
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
You see that I'm beginning to really lose control here

267
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and also hope.

268
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
There's a very thin blue line of exhaust

269
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together.

270
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Then I thought, "Wait a minute, what am I doing?"

271
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
A book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information,

272
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
it's a series of layers.

273
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
I mean, you always peel one layer off another;

274
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
we think of them as pages, doing it a certain way.

275
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
But think of them as layers. I mean, Rome is a place of layers --

276
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
horizontal layers, vertical layers --

277
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and I thought, well just peeling off a page would allow me to --

278
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
if I got you thinking about it the right way --

279
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers.

280
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
The stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in Rome

281
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
covers the scars; the scars of centuries of change

282
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
as these structures have been adapted

283
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
rather than being torn down.

284
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
If I do a foldout page on the left-hand side

285
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and let you just unfold it, you see behind it what I mean by scar tissue.

286
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
You can see that in 1635,

287
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
it became essential to make smaller windows

288
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
because the bad guys were coming or whatever.

289
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Adaptations all get buried under the stucco.

290
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what's going on inside of it.

291
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
But more importantly, I could also show you

292
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings

293
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
with all the massive stone blocks,

294
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco,

295
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
which is more often the case.

296
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
So it becomes slightly three-dimensional.

297
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
I could take you down one of those narrow little streets

298
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold --

299
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
double foldout page -- which, if you were like me

300
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
reading a pop-up book as a child, you hopefully stick your head into.

301
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
You wrap the pages around your head

302
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and are in that piazza for that brief period of time.

303
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And I've really not done anything much more complicated

304
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
than make foldout pages.

305
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
But then I thought, maybe I could be simpler here.

306
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Let's look at the Pantheon and the Piazza della Rotonda in front of it.

307
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Here's a book completely wide open.

308
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
OK, if I don't open the book the whole way,

309
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
if I just open it 90 degrees, we're looking down the front of the Pantheon,

310
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and we're looking sort of at the top, more or less down on the square.

311
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And if I turn the book the other way,

312
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
we're looking across the square at the front of the Pantheon.

313
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
No foldouts, no tricks --

314
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
just a book that isn't open the whole way.

315
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
That seemed promising. I thought, maybe I'll do it inside

316
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and I can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book.

317
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
So we get inside the Pantheon

318
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and it grows and so on and so forth.

319
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And I thought, maybe I'm on the right track,

320
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
but it sort of lost its human quality.

321
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
So I went back to the notion of story,

322
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
which is always a good thing to have if you're trying to get people

323
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way.

324
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
"Pigeon's Progress" struck me as a catchy title.

325
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
If it was a homing pigeon,

326
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
it would be called "Homer's Odyssey."

327
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
But it was the journey of the ... (Laughter)

328
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
I mean, if a title works, use it. But it would be a journey that went through Rome

329
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and showed all the things that I like about Rome.

330
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
It's a pigeon sitting on top of a church.

331
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Goes off during the day and does normal pigeon stuff. Comes back,

332
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
the whole place is covered with scaffolding and green netting

333
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and there's no way this pigeon can get home.

334
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
So it's a homeless pigeon now

335
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and it's going to have to find another place to live,

336
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things,

337
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and we start with the tall ones and so on.

338
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Maybe it has to go back and live with family members;

339
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
that's not always a good thing,

340
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
but it does sort of bring pigeons together again.

341
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And I thought, that's sort of interesting,

342
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
but maybe there's a person who should be involved in this in some way.

343
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
So I kind of came up with this old guy

344
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:38,000
who spends his life looking after sick pigeons.

345
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
He'll go anywhere to get them -- dangerous places and whatnot --

346
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and they become really friends with this guy,

347
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and learn to do tricks for him and entertain him at lunchtime and stuff like that.

348
0:16:48.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
There's a real bond that develops

349
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
between this old man and these pigeons.

350
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
But unfortunately he gets sick. He gets really sick at the end of the story.

351
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
He's taught them to spell his name, which is Aldo.

352
0:16:59.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
They show up one day after three or four days of not seeing him --

353
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
he lives in this little garret --

354
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
and they spell his name and fly around.

355
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
And he finally gets enough strength together

356
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
to climb up the ladder onto the roof,

357
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and all the pigeons, a la Red Balloon, are there waiting for him

358
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and they carry him off over the walls of the city.

359
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
And I forgot to mention this:

360
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
whenever he lost a pigeon, he would take that pigeon

361
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
out beyond the walls of the city.

362
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:28,000
In the old Roman custom, the dead

363
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
were never buried within the walls.

364
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
And I thought that's a really cheery story.

365
0:17:32.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
(Laughter). That's really going to go a long way.

366
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:39,000
So anyway, I went through ... And again, if packaging doesn't work

367
0:17:39.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
and if the stories aren't going anywhere,

368
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
I just come up with titles

369
0:17:43.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
and hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction.

370
0:17:46.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
And sometimes it does focus me enough

371
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
and I'll even do a title page.

372
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
So, these are all title pages that eventually led me

373
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:17:58,000
to the solution I settled on, which is the story of a young woman

374
0:17:58.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
who sends a message on a homing pigeon --

375
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
she lives outside the walls of the city of Rome -- to someone in the city.

376
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
And the pigeon is flying down above the Appian Way here.

377
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:11,000
You can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way.

378
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:12,000
If you see the red line,

379
0:18:12.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
you are seeing the trail of the pigeon;

380
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:16,000
if you don't see the red line, you are the pigeon.

381
0:18:16.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
And it becomes necessary and possible, at this point,

382
0:18:19.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
to try to convey what that sense would be like

383
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
of flying over the city without actually moving.

384
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
Past the Pyramid of Cestius --

385
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:31,000
these will seem very familiar to you, even if you haven't been to Rome recently --

386
0:18:31.16,000 --> 0:18:33,000
past the gatehouse.

387
0:18:33.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
This is something that's a little bit unusual.

388
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
This pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do:

389
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:4,000
it takes the scenic route, (Laughter) which was a device

390
0:18:40.16,000 --> 0:18:43,000
that I felt was necessary to actually extend this book

391
0:18:43.16,000 --> 0:18:45,000
beyond about four pages.

392
0:18:45.16,000 --> 0:18:51,000
So, we circle around the Coliseum, past the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin

393
0:18:51.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
and the Temple of Hercules towards the river.

394
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:58,000
We almost collide with the cornice of the Palazzo Farnese --

395
0:18:58.16,000 --> 0:19:01,000
designed by Michelangelo,

396
0:19:01.16,000 --> 0:19:04,000
built of stone taken from the Coliseum -- narrow escape.

397
0:19:04.16,000 --> 0:19:08,000
We swoop down over the Campo de' Fiori.

398
0:19:08.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
This is one of those things I show to my students

399
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:12,000
because it's a complete bastardization --

400
0:19:12.16,000 --> 0:19:16,000
a denial of any rules of perspective.

401
0:19:16.16,000 --> 0:19:18,000
The only rule of perspective that I think matters is

402
0:19:18.16,000 --> 0:19:21,000
if it looks believable, you've succeeded.

403
0:19:21.16,000 --> 0:19:23,000
But you try and figure out where the vanishing points meet here;

404
0:19:23.16,000 --> 0:19:25,000
a couple are on Mars and

405
0:19:25.16,000 --> 0:19:28,000
a couple of others in Cremona.

406
0:19:28.16,000 --> 0:19:31,000
But into the piazza in front of Santa Maria della Pace,

407
0:19:31.16,000 --> 0:19:33,000
where invariably a soccer game is going on,

408
0:19:33.16,000 --> 0:19:35,000
and we're hit by a soccer ball.

409
0:19:35.16,000 --> 0:19:38,000
Now this is a terrible illustration of being hit by a soccer ball.

410
0:19:38.16,000 --> 0:19:4,000
I have all the pieces:

411
0:19:40.16,000 --> 0:19:42,000
there's Santa Maria della Pace, there's a soccer ball,

412
0:19:42.16,000 --> 0:19:44,000
there's a little bit of a bird's wing -- nothing's happening,

413
0:19:44.16,000 --> 0:19:48,000
so I had to rethink it.

414
0:19:48.16,000 --> 0:19:51,000
And if you do want to see Santa Maria della Pace,

415
0:19:51.16,000 --> 0:19:53,000
these books are really flexible, incredibly interactive --

416
0:19:53.16,000 --> 0:19:55,000
just turn it around and look at it the other way.

417
0:19:55.16,000 --> 0:19:59,000
Through the alley, we can see the impact is captured in the red line.

418
0:19:59.16,000 --> 0:20:05,000
And then bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower --

419
0:20:05.16,000 --> 0:20:09,000
one of the few remaining medieval towers --

420
0:20:09.16,000 --> 0:20:12,000
towards the church of Sant'Agnese

421
0:20:12.16,000 --> 0:20:14,000
and around the dome looking down into Piazza Navona --

422
0:20:14.16,000 --> 0:20:17,000
which we've already mentioned and seen and flown over a couple of times;

423
0:20:17.16,000 --> 0:20:21,000
there's the Bernini statue of the Four Rivers --

424
0:20:21.16,000 --> 0:20:26,000
and then past the wonderful Borromini Sant'Ivo,

425
0:20:26.16,000 --> 0:20:29,000
stopping just long enough on the 26-foot diameter Oculus

426
0:20:29.16,000 --> 0:20:31,000
of the Pantheon to catch our breath.

427
0:20:31.16,000 --> 0:20:33,000
And then we can swoop inside and around; and because we're flying,

428
0:20:33.16,000 --> 0:20:35,000
we don't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time,

429
0:20:35.16,000 --> 0:20:4,000
so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page.

430
0:20:40.16,000 --> 0:20:44,000
We get a little exuberant as we pass Gesu;

431
0:20:44.16,000 --> 0:20:47,000
it's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way.

432
0:20:47.16,000 --> 0:20:52,000
Past the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that I was talking about;

433
0:20:52.16,000 --> 0:20:56,000
beautiful carvings set into the walls above the neon "Ristorante" sign, and so on.

434
0:20:56.16,000 --> 0:20:58,000
And eventually, we arrive at the courtyard of the palazzo,

435
0:20:58.16,000 --> 0:21:,000
which is our destination.

436
0:21:00.16,000 --> 0:21:02,000
Straight up through the courtyard

437
0:21:02.16,000 --> 0:21:05,000
into a little window into the attic,

438
0:21:05.16,000 --> 0:21:08,000
where somebody is working at the drawing board.

439
0:21:08.16,000 --> 0:21:1,000
He removes the message from the leg of the bird; this is what it says.

440
0:21:10.16,000 --> 0:21:13,000
As we look at the drawing board,

441
0:21:13.16,000 --> 0:21:15,000
we see what he's working on is, in fact,

442
0:21:15.16,000 --> 0:21:17,000
a map of the journey that the pigeon has just taken,

443
0:21:17.16,000 --> 0:21:19,000
and the red line extends through all the sights.

444
0:21:19.16,000 --> 0:21:22,000
And if you want the information, so that we complete this cycle of understanding,

445
0:21:22.16,000 --> 0:21:25,000
all you have to do is read these paragraphs.

446
0:21:25.16,000 --> 0:21:27,000
Thank you very much.

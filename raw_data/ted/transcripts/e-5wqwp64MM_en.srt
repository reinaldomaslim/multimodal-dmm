1
0:00:12.769,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I want you guys to imagine that you're a soldier

2
0:00:15.327,000 --> 0:00:16,000
running through the battlefield.

3
0:00:17.228,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Now, you're shot in the leg with a bullet,

4
0:00:19.444,000 --> 0:00:21,000
which severs your femoral artery.

5
0:00:21.671,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Now, this bleed is extremely traumatic

6
0:00:23.797,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and can kill you in less than three minutes.

7
0:00:26.532,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Unfortunately, by the time that a medic

8
0:00:28.6,000 --> 0:00:29,000
actually gets to you,

9
0:00:30.276,000 --> 0:00:32,000
what the medic has on his or her belt

10
0:00:32.527,000 --> 0:00:34,000
can take five minutes or more,

11
0:00:34.787,000 --> 0:00:37,000
with the application of pressure, to stop that type of bleed.

12
0:00:37.951,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Now, this problem is not only a huge problem

13
0:00:40.204,000 --> 0:00:42,000
for the military, but it's also a huge problem

14
0:00:42.893,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that's epidemic throughout the entire medical field,

15
0:00:45.875,000 --> 0:00:47,000
which is how do we actually look at wounds

16
0:00:48.506,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and how do we stop them quickly

17
0:00:50.307,000 --> 0:00:52,000
in a way that can work with the body?

18
0:00:52.668,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So now, what I've been working on for the last four years

19
0:00:55.481,000 --> 0:00:57,000
is to develop smart biomaterials,

20
0:00:58.476,000 --> 0:00:59,000
which are actually materials that will work

21
0:01:00.453,000 --> 0:01:02,000
with the body, helping it to heal

22
0:01:02.635,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and helping it to allow the wounds to heal normally.

23
0:01:06.995,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So now, before we do this, we have to take a much closer look

24
0:01:10.585,000 --> 0:01:12,000
at actually how does the body work.

25
0:01:12.743,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So now, everybody here knows

26
0:01:14.133,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that the body is made up of cells.

27
0:01:16.23,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So the cell is the most basic unit of life.

28
0:01:18.947,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But not many people know what else.

29
0:01:21.411,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But it actually turns out that your cells

30
0:01:23.942,000 --> 0:01:25,000
sit in this mesh of complicated fibers,

31
0:01:26.686,000 --> 0:01:27,000
proteins and sugars

32
0:01:28.319,000 --> 0:01:3,000
known as the extracellular matrix.

33
0:01:30.331,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So now, the ECM

34
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
is actually this mesh that holds the cells in place,

35
0:01:35.19,000 --> 0:01:36,000
provides structure for your tissues,

36
0:01:37.03,000 --> 0:01:39,000
but it also gives the cells a home.

37
0:01:39.476,000 --> 0:01:41,000
It allows them to feel what they're doing,

38
0:01:41.603,000 --> 0:01:42,000
where they are, and tells them

39
0:01:43.188,000 --> 0:01:45,000
how to act and how to behave.

40
0:01:45.528,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And it actually turns out that the extracellular matrix

41
0:01:48.46,000 --> 0:01:5,000
is different from every single part of the body.

42
0:01:51.423,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So the ECM in my skin

43
0:01:52.84,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is different than the ECM in my liver,

44
0:01:54.955,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and the ECM in different parts of the same organ

45
0:01:57.733,000 --> 0:01:59,000
actually vary, so it's very difficult

46
0:01:59.941,000 --> 0:02:,000
to be able to have a product

47
0:02:01.718,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that will react to the local extracellular matrix,

48
0:02:04.125,000 --> 0:02:06,000
which is exactly what we're trying to do.

49
0:02:06.218,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So now, for example, think of the rainforest.

50
0:02:08.94,000 --> 0:02:1,000
You have the canopy, you have the understory,

51
0:02:11.325,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and you have the forest floor.

52
0:02:12.9,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Now, all of these parts of the forest

53
0:02:14.685,000 --> 0:02:15,000
are made up of different plants,

54
0:02:16.451,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and different animals call them home.

55
0:02:18.869,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So just like that, the extracellular matrix

56
0:02:21.18,000 --> 0:02:23,000
is incredibly diverse in three dimensions.

57
0:02:23.972,000 --> 0:02:25,000
On top of that, the extracellular matrix

58
0:02:26.889,000 --> 0:02:28,000
is responsible for all wound healing,

59
0:02:29.42,000 --> 0:02:3,000
so if you imagine cutting the body,

60
0:02:31.175,000 --> 0:02:33,000
you actually have to rebuild

61
0:02:33.2,000 --> 0:02:34,000
this very complex ECM

62
0:02:35.157,000 --> 0:02:37,000
in order to get it to form again,

63
0:02:37.2,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and a scar, in fact, is actually

64
0:02:38.779,000 --> 0:02:41,000
poorly formed extracellular matrix.

65
0:02:42.233,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So now, behind me is an animation

66
0:02:44.291,000 --> 0:02:45,000
of the extracellular matrix.

67
0:02:45.899,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So as you see, your cells sit in this complicated mesh

68
0:02:48.555,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and as you move throughout the tissue,

69
0:02:51.187,000 --> 0:02:53,000
the extracellular matrix changes.

70
0:02:53.268,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So now every other piece of technology on the market

71
0:02:56.075,000 --> 0:02:59,000
can only manage a two- dimensional approximation

72
0:02:59.151,000 --> 0:03:,000
of the extracellular matrix,

73
0:03:00.906,000 --> 0:03:01,000
which means that it doesn't fit in

74
0:03:02.694,000 --> 0:03:03,000
with the tissue itself.

75
0:03:04.46,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So when I was a freshman at NYU,

76
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
what I discovered was you could actually take

77
0:03:08.464,000 --> 0:03:1,000
small pieces of plant-derived polymers

78
0:03:10.985,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and reassemble them onto the wound.

79
0:03:13.639,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So if you have a bleeding wound like the one behind me,

80
0:03:16.297,000 --> 0:03:18,000
you can actually put our material onto this,

81
0:03:18.87,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and just like Lego blocks,

82
0:03:20.81,000 --> 0:03:22,000
it'll reassemble into the local tissue.

83
0:03:22.993,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So that means if you put it onto liver,

84
0:03:24.859,000 --> 0:03:25,000
it turns into something that looks like liver,

85
0:03:26.61,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and if you put it onto skin,

86
0:03:28.133,000 --> 0:03:3,000
it turns into something that looks just like skin.

87
0:03:30.236,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So when you put the gel on,

88
0:03:31.616,000 --> 0:03:34,000
it actually reassembles into this local tissue.

89
0:03:34.927,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So now, this has a whole bunch of applications,

90
0:03:38.533,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but basically the idea is, wherever you put this product,

91
0:03:41.485,000 --> 0:03:43,000
you're able to reassemble into it immediately.

92
0:03:44.32,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Now, this is a simulated arterial bleed —

93
0:03:46.681,000 --> 0:03:47,000
blood warning —

94
0:03:48.04,000 --> 0:03:49,000
at twice human artery pressure.

95
0:03:49.84,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So now, this type of bleed is incredibly traumatic,

96
0:03:52.273,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and like I said before, would actually take

97
0:03:54.5,000 --> 0:03:55,000
five minutes or more with pressure

98
0:03:56.356,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to be able to stop.

99
0:03:57.728,000 --> 0:04:,000
Now, in the time that it takes me to introduce the bleed itself,

100
0:04:00.749,000 --> 0:04:02,000
our material is able to stop that bleed,

101
0:04:02.878,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and it's because it actually goes on and works

102
0:04:05.154,000 --> 0:04:06,000
with the body to heal,

103
0:04:06.886,000 --> 0:04:08,000
so it reassembles into this piece of meat,

104
0:04:09.258,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and then the blood actually recognizes

105
0:04:12.138,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that that's happening, and produces fibrin,

106
0:04:14.725,000 --> 0:04:17,000
producing a very fast clot in less than 10 seconds.

107
0:04:18.47,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So now this technology — Thank you.

108
0:04:20.349,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Applause)

109
0:04:28.606,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So now this technology, by January, will be in the hands of veterinarians,

110
0:04:32.188,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and we're working very diligently to try to get it into the hands of doctors,

111
0:04:35.765,000 --> 0:04:36,000
hopefully within the next year.

112
0:04:37.53,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But really, once again, I want you guys to imagine

113
0:04:40.137,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that you are a soldier running through a battlefield.

114
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Now, you get hit in the leg with a bullet,

115
0:04:43.927,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and instead of bleeding out in three minutes,

116
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
you pull a small pack of gel out of your belt,

117
0:04:49.248,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and with the press of a button,

118
0:04:50.575,000 --> 0:04:51,000
you're able to stop your own bleed

119
0:04:51.984,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and you're on your way to recovery.

120
0:04:53.893,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Thank you very much.

121
0:04:55.783,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Applause)

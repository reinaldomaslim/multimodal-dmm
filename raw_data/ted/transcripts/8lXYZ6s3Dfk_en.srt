0:00:16.093,000 --> 0:00:19,000
When I graduated UCLA, I moved to Northern California,

3
0:00:19.895,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and I lived in a little town called Elk, on the Mendocino coast.

4
0:00:23.993,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And I didn't have a phone or TV, but I had US mail.

5
0:00:28.451,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And life was good back then -- if you could remember it.

6
0:00:32.953,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I'd go to the general store for a cup of coffee and a brownie,

7
0:00:36.889,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I'd ship my film to San Francisco,

8
0:00:39.154,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and lo and behold, two days later,

9
0:00:42.695,000 --> 0:00:43,000
it would end up on my front door,

10
0:00:44.318,000 --> 0:00:48,000
which was way better than having to fight the traffic of Hollywood.

11
0:00:49.185,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I didn't have much money,

12
0:00:50.877,000 --> 0:00:52,000
(Music)

13
0:00:53.142,000 --> 0:00:55,000
but I had time and a sense of wonder.

14
0:00:55.984,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So I started shooting time-lapse photography.

15
0:00:59.247,000 --> 0:01:03,000
It would take me a month to shoot a four-minute roll of film,

16
0:01:03.331,000 --> 0:01:04,000
because that's all I could afford.

17
0:01:06.219,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I've been shooting time-lapse flowers continuously, nonstop,

18
0:01:10.095,000 --> 0:01:11,000
24 hours a day, seven days a week,

19
0:01:11.908,000 --> 0:01:12,000
for over 30 years.

20
0:01:13.795,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And to see them move is a dance I'll never get tired of.

21
0:01:18.677,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Their beauty immerses us with color, taste, touch.

22
0:01:23.458,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It also provides a third of the food we eat.

23
0:01:26.293,000 --> 0:01:29,000
(Music)

24
0:01:29.393,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Beauty and seduction are nature's tools for survival,

25
0:01:33.249,000 --> 0:01:35,000
because we protect what we fall in love with.

26
0:01:36.36,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It opens our hearts

27
0:01:37.556,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and makes us realize we are a part of nature,

28
0:01:40.082,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and we're not separate from it.

29
0:01:43.269,000 --> 0:01:45,000
When we see ourselves in nature,

30
0:01:45.317,000 --> 0:01:47,000
it also connects us to every one of us,

31
0:01:48.322,000 --> 0:01:5,000
because it's clear that it's all connected in one.

32
0:01:52.953,000 --> 0:01:55,000
When people see my images, a lot of times they'll say,

33
0:01:56.017,000 --> 0:01:57,000
"Oh my God."

34
0:01:57.953,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Have you ever wondered what that meant?

35
0:02:00.365,000 --> 0:02:02,000
The "oh" means it caught your attention;

36
0:02:03.078,000 --> 0:02:05,000
it makes you present, makes you mindful.

37
0:02:06.2,000 --> 0:02:09,000
The "my" means it connects with something deep inside your soul.

38
0:02:10.88,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up and be heard.

39
0:02:15.429,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And "God"?

40
0:02:17.325,000 --> 0:02:2,000
God is that personal journey we all want to be on,

41
0:02:20.53,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to be inspired,

42
0:02:22.977,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to feel like we're connected to a universe that celebrates life.

43
0:02:28.485,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Did you know that 80 percent of the information we receive

44
0:02:32.572,000 --> 0:02:34,000
comes through our eyes,

45
0:02:34.723,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and if you compare light energy to musical scales,

46
0:02:37.932,000 --> 0:02:39,000
it would only be one octave that the naked eye could see,

47
0:02:40.782,000 --> 0:02:41,000
which is right in the middle?

48
0:02:43.138,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And aren't we grateful for our brains,

49
0:02:45.091,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that can take this electrical impulse that comes from light energy

50
0:02:49.081,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to create images in order for us to explore our world?

51
0:02:54.401,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And aren't we grateful that we have hearts that can feel these vibrations

52
0:02:58.619,000 --> 0:03:,000
in order for us to allow ourselves

53
0:03:01.219,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to feel the pleasure and the beauty of nature?

54
0:03:09.171,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Nature's beauty is a gift

55
0:03:10.549,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that cultivates appreciation and gratitude.

56
0:03:17.982,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So, I have a gift I want to share with you today,

57
0:03:20.665,000 --> 0:03:23,000
a project I'm working on called "Happiness Revealed."

58
0:03:24.184,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And it'll give us a glimpse into that perspective --

59
0:03:27.279,000 --> 0:03:3,000
from the point of view of a child and an elderly man --

60
0:03:30.692,000 --> 0:03:31,000
of that world.

61
0:03:35.756,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Little girl: When I watch TV,

62
0:03:40.569,000 --> 0:03:45,000
it's just some shows that you just -- that are pretend.

63
0:03:45.752,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And when you explore,

64
0:03:48.198,000 --> 0:03:52,000
you get more imagination than you already had,

65
0:03:53.178,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and when you get more imagination,

66
0:03:56.374,000 --> 0:03:58,000
it makes you want to go deeper in

67
0:03:58.897,000 --> 0:04:01,000
so you can get more and see beautifuller things,

68
0:04:02.101,000 --> 0:04:04,000
like the path,

69
0:04:04.556,000 --> 0:04:08,000
if it's a path, it could lead you to a beach or something,

70
0:04:09.405,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and it could be beautiful.

71
0:04:14.012,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Music)

72
0:04:40.471,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Narrator) Brother David Steindl-Rast: Do you think this is just another day

73
0:04:44.174,000 --> 0:04:45,000
in your life?

74
0:04:46.967,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It's not just another day.

75
0:04:49.667,000 --> 0:04:52,000
It's the one day that is given to you:

76
0:04:53.529,000 --> 0:04:54,000
today.

77
0:04:54.873,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Music)

78
0:04:57.203,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It's given to you.

79
0:05:00.234,000 --> 0:05:01,000
It's a gift.

80
0:05:03.37,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It's the only gift that you have right now.

81
0:05:07.356,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And the only appropriate response

82
0:05:10.261,000 --> 0:05:11,000
is gratefulness.

83
0:05:13.673,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Music)

84
0:05:21.352,000 --> 0:05:26,000
If you do nothing else but to cultivate that response

85
0:05:27.349,000 --> 0:05:31,000
to the great gift that this unique day is,

86
0:05:32.738,000 --> 0:05:38,000
if you learn to respond as if it were the first day in your life

87
0:05:39.188,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and the very last day,

88
0:05:41.894,000 --> 0:05:46,000
then you will have spent this day very well.

89
0:05:47.924,000 --> 0:05:49,000
(Music)

90
0:05:50.62,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Begin by opening your eyes

91
0:05:52.749,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and be surprised that you have eyes you can open,

92
0:05:57.477,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that incredible array of colors that is constantly offered to us

93
0:06:02.757,000 --> 0:06:04,000
for our pure enjoyment.

94
0:06:07.202,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Look at the sky.

95
0:06:10.619,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We so rarely look at the sky.

96
0:06:14.094,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We so rarely note how different it is from moment to moment,

97
0:06:20.447,000 --> 0:06:21,000
with clouds coming and going.

98
0:06:24.181,000 --> 0:06:26,000
We just think of the weather,

99
0:06:26.566,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and even with the weather,

100
0:06:27.859,000 --> 0:06:3,000
we don't think of all the many nuances of weather.

101
0:06:31.718,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We just think of "good weather" and "bad weather."

102
0:06:35.907,000 --> 0:06:38,000
This day, right now, has unique weather,

103
0:06:40.619,000 --> 0:06:45,000
maybe a kind that will never exactly, in that form, come again.

104
0:06:46.475,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The formation of clouds in the sky will never be the same

105
0:06:50.546,000 --> 0:06:51,000
as it is right now.

106
0:06:53.387,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Open your eyes. Look at that.

107
0:06:56.707,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Music)

108
0:06:59.273,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Look at the faces of people whom you meet.

109
0:07:04.081,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Each one has an incredible story

110
0:07:08.337,000 --> 0:07:11,000
behind their face,

111
0:07:11.441,000 --> 0:07:15,000
a story that you could never fully fathom,

112
0:07:17.704,000 --> 0:07:21,000
not only their own story, but the story of their ancestors.

113
0:07:24.711,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We all go back so far,

114
0:07:28.742,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and in this present moment, on this day,

115
0:07:32.538,000 --> 0:07:36,000
all the people you meet, all that life from generations

116
0:07:37.249,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and from so many places all over the world

117
0:07:41.415,000 --> 0:07:43,000
flows together and meets you here,

118
0:07:45.099,000 --> 0:07:47,000
like a life-giving water,

119
0:07:47.312,000 --> 0:07:49,000
if you only open your heart and drink.

120
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Music)

121
0:07:58.74,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Open your heart to the incredible gifts

122
0:08:02.376,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that civilization gives to us.

123
0:08:05.62,000 --> 0:08:08,000
You flip a switch, and there is electric light.

124
0:08:09.377,000 --> 0:08:14,000
You turn a faucet, and there is warm water and cold water,

125
0:08:15.019,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and drinkable water.

126
0:08:17.54,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It's a gift that millions and millions in the world

127
0:08:22.034,000 --> 0:08:23,000
will never experience.

128
0:08:25.097,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So these are just a few of an enormous number of gifts

129
0:08:30.261,000 --> 0:08:31,000
to which we can open your heart.

130
0:08:33.773,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And so I wish you that you will open your heart

131
0:08:37.068,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to all these blessings,

132
0:08:40.035,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and let them flow through you,

133
0:08:43.53,000 --> 0:08:46,000
that everyone whom you will meet on this day

134
0:08:46.892,000 --> 0:08:48,000
will be blessed by you,

135
0:08:50.859,000 --> 0:08:51,000
just by your eyes,

136
0:08:54.308,000 --> 0:08:55,000
by your smile,

137
0:08:58.095,000 --> 0:08:59,000
by your touch,

138
0:09:01.413,000 --> 0:09:02,000
just by your presence.

139
0:09:05.777,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Let the gratefulness overflow

140
0:09:09.345,000 --> 0:09:11,000
into blessing all around you.

141
0:09:12.661,000 --> 0:09:14,000
(Music)

142
0:09:15.349,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And then, it will really be

143
0:09:18.828,000 --> 0:09:2,000
a good day.

144
0:09:30.91,000 --> 0:09:31,000
(Applause)

145
0:09:32.242,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Louie Schwartzberg: Thank you.

146
0:09:33.703,000 --> 0:09:34,000
(Applause)

147
0:09:34.823,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Thank you very much.

148
0:09:36.392,000 --> 0:09:41,000
(Applause)

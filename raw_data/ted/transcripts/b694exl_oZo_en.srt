1
0:00:25.666,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I would like to tell you about a project which I started about 16 years ago.

2
0:00:32.69,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It's about making new forms of life.

3
0:00:37.388,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And these are made of this kind of tube --

4
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:43,000
electricity tube, we call it in Holland.

5
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And we can start a film about that,

6
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and we can see a little bit backwards in time.

7
0:00:52.731,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Video) Narrator: Eventually, these beasts are going to live in herds on the beaches.

8
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Theo Jansen is working hard on this evolution.

9
0:01:03.209,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Theo Jansen: I want to put these forms of life on the beaches.

10
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And they should survive over there,

11
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:13,000
on their own, in the future.

12
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Learning to live on their own --

13
0:01:19.928,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and it'll take couple of more years

14
0:01:24.579,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to let them walk on their own.

15
0:01:29.698,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Narrator: The mechanical beasts will not get their energy from food,

16
0:01:33.025,000 --> 0:01:34,000
but from the wind.

17
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:38,000
The wind will move feathers on their back, which will drive their feet.

18
0:01:38.968,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The beast walks sideways on the wet sand of the beach,

19
0:01:42.753,000 --> 0:01:44,000
with its nose pointed into the wind.

20
0:01:46.904,000 --> 0:01:5,000
As soon as it walks into either the rolling surf or the dry sand,

21
0:01:51.736,000 --> 0:01:54,000
it stops, and walks in the opposite direction.

22
0:01:57.197,000 --> 0:02:,000
Evolution has generated many species.

23
0:02:00.848,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Music)

24
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:17,000
This is the Animaris Currens Ventosa.

25
0:02:17.229,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Music)

26
0:02:24.026,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Laughter)

27
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:33,000
(Applause)

28
0:02:35.77,000 --> 0:02:41,000
TJ: This is a herd, and it is built according to genetic codes.

29
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And it is a sort of race, and each and every animal is different,

30
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and the winning codes will multiply.

31
0:02:49.195,000 --> 0:02:51,000
This is the wave, going from left to right.

32
0:02:51.973,000 --> 0:02:52,000
You can see this one.

33
0:02:57.416,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Yes, and now it goes from left to right.

34
0:03:00.884,000 --> 0:03:02,000
This is a new generation, a new family,

35
0:03:03.69,000 --> 0:03:05,000
which is able to store the wind.

36
0:03:06.888,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So, the wings pump up air in lemonade bottles,

37
0:03:10.339,000 --> 0:03:11,000
which are on top of that.

38
0:03:12.213,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And they can use that energy in case the wind falls away,

39
0:03:18.001,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and the tide is coming up,

40
0:03:19.516,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and there is still a little bit of energy to reach the dunes and save their lives,

41
0:03:25.325,000 --> 0:03:27,000
because they are drowned very easily.

42
0:03:27.349,000 --> 0:03:29,000
(Laughter)

43
0:03:32.797,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I could show you this animal.

44
0:03:42.78,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Applause)

45
0:03:45.335,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Thank you.

46
0:03:46.562,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Applause)

47
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So, the proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking.

48
0:03:57.466,000 --> 0:04:,000
There are 11 numbers, which I call The 11 Holy Numbers.

49
0:04:01.102,000 --> 0:04:05,000
These are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way.

50
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:08,000
In fact, it's a new invention of the wheel.

51
0:04:09.429,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It works the same as a wheel.

52
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:14,000
The axis of a wheel stays on the same level,

53
0:04:14.491,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and this hip is staying on the same level as well.

54
0:04:18.333,000 --> 0:04:2,000
In fact, this is better than a wheel,

55
0:04:20.527,000 --> 0:04:24,000
because when you try to drive your bicycle on the beach,

56
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:28,000
you will notice it's very hard to do.

57
0:04:28.776,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And the feet just step over the sand,

58
0:04:33.689,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and the wheel has to touch every piece of the ground in-between.

59
0:04:38.228,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So 5,000 years after the invention of the wheel,

60
0:04:42.173,000 --> 0:04:43,000
we have a new wheel.

61
0:04:44.141,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I will show you, in the next video --

62
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:49,000
can you start it, please? --

63
0:04:49.498,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that very heavy loads can be moved.

64
0:04:56.083,000 --> 0:04:58,000
There's a guy pushing there, behind,

65
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:01,000
but it can also walk on the wind very well.

66
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It's 3.2 tons.

67
0:05:07.416,000 --> 0:05:13,000
This is working on the stored wind in the bottles.

68
0:05:13.817,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It has a feeler, where it can feel obstacles and turn around.

69
0:05:17.809,000 --> 0:05:19,000
You see, it's going the other way.

70
0:05:31.098,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Can I have the feeler here?

71
0:05:38.541,000 --> 0:05:39,000
OK. Good.

72
0:05:42.826,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So, they have to survive all the dangers of the beach,

73
0:05:48.307,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and one of the big dangers is the sea.

74
0:05:50.223,000 --> 0:05:51,000
This is the sea.

75
0:05:52.113,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And it must feel the water of the sea.

76
0:05:55.842,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And this is the water feeler,

77
0:05:58,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and what's very important is this tube.

78
0:06:00.693,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It sucks in air normally,

79
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:09,000
but when it swallows water, it feels the resistance of it.

80
0:06:09.809,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So, imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea.

81
0:06:17.761,000 --> 0:06:19,000
As soon as it touches the water --

82
0:06:20.023,000 --> 0:06:26,000
you should hear a sound of running air.

83
0:06:31.235,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Sound of running air)

84
0:06:32.315,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Yes!

85
0:06:36.627,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So if it doesn't feel, it will be drowned, OK?

86
0:06:47.178,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Here we have the brain of the animal.

87
0:06:50.903,000 --> 0:06:54,000
In fact, it is a step counter, and it counts the steps.

88
0:06:55.468,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It's a binary step counter.

89
0:06:57.587,000 --> 0:07:,000
So as soon it has been to the sea,

90
0:07:00.654,000 --> 0:07:05,000
it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here.

91
0:07:08.291,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And it always knows where it is on the beach.

92
0:07:10.918,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So it's very simple brain.

93
0:07:13.654,000 --> 0:07:16,000
It says, well, there's the sea, there are dunes, and I'm here.

94
0:07:17.825,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So it's a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal.

95
0:07:23.793,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Thank you.

96
0:07:26.571,000 --> 0:07:31,000
One of the biggest enemies are the storms.

97
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:38,000
This is a part of the nose of the Animaris Percipiere.

98
0:07:42.285,000 --> 0:07:45,000
When the nose of the animal is fixed, the whole animal is fixed.

99
0:07:47.745,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So when the storm is coming up,

100
0:07:52.07,000 --> 0:07:56,000
it drives a pin into the ground.

101
0:07:56.483,000 --> 0:07:58,000
(Laughter)

102
0:07:59.023,000 --> 0:08:,000
Audience member: Wow!

103
0:08:00.212,000 --> 0:08:02,000
The nose is fixed, the whole animal is fixed.

104
0:08:02.358,000 --> 0:08:05,000
The wind may turn, but the animal will always turn its nose into the wind.

105
0:08:09.308,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Now, another couple of years, and these animals will survive on their own.

106
0:08:15.277,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I still have to help them a lot.

107
0:08:17.5,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

108
0:08:19.531,000 --> 0:08:2,000
(Applause)

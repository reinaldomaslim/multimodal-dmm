1
0:00:15.918,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 1979

2
0:00:20.604,000 --> 0:00:23,000
on the exact same day, at the exact same moment,

3
0:00:23.897,000 --> 0:00:25,000
each conceiving a baby, OK?

4
0:00:26.203,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So two couples each conceiving one baby.

5
0:00:28.481,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception,

6
0:00:31.771,000 --> 0:00:33,000
because if you do, you're not going to listen to me,

7
0:00:34.651,000 --> 0:00:35,000
so just imagine that for a moment.

8
0:00:36.486,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And in this scenario, I want to imagine that, in one case,

9
0:00:40.684,000 --> 0:00:42,000
the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome,

10
0:00:42.876,000 --> 0:00:44,000
meeting that X chromosome of the egg.

11
0:00:44.931,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And in the other case, the sperm is carrying an X chromosome,

12
0:00:48.127,000 --> 0:00:5,000
meeting the X chromosome of the egg.

13
0:00:50.418,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Both are viable; both take off.

14
0:00:53.007,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We'll come back to these people later.

15
0:00:55.079,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So I wear two hats in most of what I do.

16
0:00:59.134,000 --> 0:01:02,000
As the one hat, I do history of anatomy.

17
0:01:02.357,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I'm a historian by training, and what I study in that case

18
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
is the way that people have dealt with anatomy --

19
0:01:08.87,000 --> 0:01:1,000
meaning human bodies, animal bodies --

20
0:01:11.524,000 --> 0:01:13,000
how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies;

21
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
how have they thought about bodies.

22
0:01:16.993,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The other hat that I've worn in my work is as an activist,

23
0:01:20.973,000 --> 0:01:21,000
as a patient advocate --

24
0:01:22.853,000 --> 0:01:24,000
or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate --

25
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
for people who are patients of doctors.

26
0:01:27.521,000 --> 0:01:3,000
In that case, what I've worked with is people who have body types

27
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that challenge social norms.

28
0:01:33.199,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So some of what I've worked on, for example,

29
0:01:35.38,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is people who are conjoined twins --

30
0:01:37.451,000 --> 0:01:38,000
two people within one body.

31
0:01:39.5,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Some of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism --

32
0:01:42.244,000 --> 0:01:44,000
so people who are much shorter than typical.

33
0:01:44.552,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And a lot of what I've worked on is people who have atypical sex --

34
0:01:48.598,000 --> 0:01:52,000
so people who don't have the standard male or the standard female body types.

35
0:01:52.65,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And as a general term, we can use the term "intersex" for this.

36
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Intersex comes in a lot of different forms.

37
0:01:58.822,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I'll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex

38
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that isn't standard for male or female.

39
0:02:04.617,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So in one instance,

40
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis,

41
0:02:09.72,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome

42
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
tells the proto-gonads, which we all have in the fetal life,

43
0:02:15.688,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to become testes.

44
0:02:16.896,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So in the fetal life, those testes are pumping out testosterone.

45
0:02:20.042,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone,

46
0:02:25.249,000 --> 0:02:27,000
the body doesn't react to the testosterone.

47
0:02:27.353,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome.

48
0:02:30.952,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So lots of levels of testosterone, but no reaction to it.

49
0:02:33.838,000 --> 0:02:36,000
As a consequence, the body develops more along the female typical path.

50
0:02:37.764,000 --> 0:02:39,000
When the child is born, she looks like a girl.

51
0:02:40.066,000 --> 0:02:43,000
She is a girl, she is raised as a girl.

52
0:02:43.188,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And it's often not until she hits puberty and she's growing and developing breasts,

53
0:02:47.758,000 --> 0:02:48,000
but she's not getting her period,

54
0:02:49.361,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that somebody figures out something's up here.

55
0:02:51.549,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And they do some tests and figure out

56
0:02:53.342,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that, instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus,

57
0:02:55.843,000 --> 0:02:57,000
she has testes inside, and she has a Y chromosome.

58
0:02:58.313,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Now what's important to understand

59
0:03:00.028,000 --> 0:03:02,000
is you may think of this person as really being male,

60
0:03:02.54,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but they're really not.

61
0:03:03.792,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Females, like males,

62
0:03:05.88,000 --> 0:03:07,000
have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands.

63
0:03:08.559,000 --> 0:03:09,000
They're in the back of our body.

64
0:03:10.14,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And the adrenal glands make androgens, which are a masculinizing hormone.

65
0:03:13.594,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Most females like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female --

66
0:03:16.719,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I don't actually know my chromosomal make-up,

67
0:03:18.902,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but I think I'm probably typical --

68
0:03:20.611,000 --> 0:03:22,000
most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive.

69
0:03:23.117,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We're making androgen, and we're responding to androgens.

70
0:03:25.862,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The consequence is that somebody like me

71
0:03:27.975,000 --> 0:03:3,000
has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens

72
0:03:31.018,000 --> 0:03:34,000
than the woman born with testes who has androgen insensitivity syndrome.

73
0:03:34.424,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So sex is really complicated --

74
0:03:35.97,000 --> 0:03:36,000
it's not just that intersex people

75
0:03:37.638,000 --> 0:03:39,000
are in the middle of all the sex spectrum --

76
0:03:39.739,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in some ways, they can be all over the place.

77
0:03:41.86,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Another example:

78
0:03:43.042,000 --> 0:03:45,000
a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old,

79
0:03:45.971,000 --> 0:03:46,000
who was born a boy, raised a boy,

80
0:03:47.858,000 --> 0:03:49,000
had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend,

81
0:03:50.467,000 --> 0:03:51,000
had a life as a guy,

82
0:03:52.163,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.

83
0:03:55.789,000 --> 0:03:56,000
What he had was an extreme form

84
0:03:57.565,000 --> 0:03:59,000
of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

85
0:04:00.27,000 --> 0:04:01,000
He had XX chromosomes,

86
0:04:02.22,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and in the womb, his adrenal glands were in such high gear

87
0:04:05.983,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that it created, essentially, a masculine hormonal environment.

88
0:04:09.625,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And as a consequence, his genitals were masculinized,

89
0:04:12.187,000 --> 0:04:15,000
his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones.

90
0:04:15.723,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspected anything.

91
0:04:18.984,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And it was only when he had reached the age of 19

92
0:04:21.719,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that he began to have enough medical problems from menstruating internally,

93
0:04:25.334,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female, internally.

94
0:04:29.194,000 --> 0:04:32,000
OK, so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex.

95
0:04:32.752,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Some people who have XX chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis,

96
0:04:36.655,000 --> 0:04:39,000
which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it.

97
0:04:40.418,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And we're not exactly sure why that happens.

98
0:04:42.568,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So sex can come in lots of different varieties.

99
0:04:45.415,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies --

100
0:04:50.286,000 --> 0:04:52,000
whether it's dwarfism, or it's conjoined twinning,

101
0:04:53.077,000 --> 0:04:54,000
or it's an intersex type --

102
0:04:54.427,000 --> 0:04:56,000
are often "normalized" by surgeons

103
0:04:56.832,000 --> 0:05:,000
is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health.

104
0:05:00.896,000 --> 0:05:02,000
In many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy.

105
0:05:03.902,000 --> 0:05:06,000
The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries

106
0:05:06.968,000 --> 0:05:08,000
is because they threaten our social categories.

107
0:05:09.813,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Our system has been based typically on the idea

108
0:05:12.606,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity.

109
0:05:15.96,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman

110
0:05:18.587,000 --> 0:05:19,000
is to have a female identity;

111
0:05:20.003,000 --> 0:05:24,000
what it means to be a black person is, allegedly, to have an African anatomy

112
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
in terms of your history.

113
0:05:26.377,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And so we have this terribly simplistic idea.

114
0:05:30.18,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And when we're faced with a body

115
0:05:31.837,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that actually presents us something quite different,

116
0:05:34.795,000 --> 0:05:36,000
it startles us in terms of those categorizations.

117
0:05:37.613,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism.

118
0:05:41.578,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism.

119
0:05:45.243,000 --> 0:05:46,000
You can imagine how startling then it is

120
0:05:47.172,000 --> 0:05:5,000
when you have children who are born who are two people inside of one body.

121
0:05:51.531,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently

122
0:05:55.558,000 --> 0:05:57,000
was last year when South African runner, Caster Semenya,

123
0:05:58.453,000 --> 0:06:01,000
had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin.

124
0:06:02.032,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I had a lot of journalists calling me, asking me,

125
0:06:04.88,000 --> 0:06:05,000
"Which is the test they're going to run

126
0:06:06.778,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that will tell us whether or not Caster Semenya is male or female?"

127
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test.

128
0:06:13.577,000 --> 0:06:16,000
In fact, we now know that sex is complicated enough

129
0:06:17.452,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that we have to admit:

130
0:06:19.21,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female,

131
0:06:22.923,000 --> 0:06:24,000
or between male and intersex and female and intersex;

132
0:06:25.856,000 --> 0:06:27,000
we actually draw that line on nature.

133
0:06:28.452,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes,

134
0:06:33.143,000 --> 0:06:35,000
the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories

135
0:06:36.103,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that we thought of as stable anatomical categories,

136
0:06:38.814,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that mapped very simply to stable identity categories

137
0:06:42.505,000 --> 0:06:44,000
are a lot more fuzzy than we thought.

138
0:06:44.664,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And it's not just in terms of sex.

139
0:06:46.641,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It's also in terms of race,

140
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
which turns out to be vastly more complicated

141
0:06:50.7,000 --> 0:06:52,000
than our terminology has allowed.

142
0:06:52.816,000 --> 0:06:55,000
As we look, we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas.

143
0:06:55.932,000 --> 0:06:56,000
We look, for example, about the fact

144
0:06:57.785,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees.

145
0:07:02.121,000 --> 0:07:03,000
What are we to make of the fact

146
0:07:03.845,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that we differ from them only, really, by a few nucleotides?

147
0:07:07.336,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And as we get farther and farther with our science,

148
0:07:09.803,000 --> 0:07:11,000
we get more and more into a discomforted zone,

149
0:07:12.016,000 --> 0:07:15,000
where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we've had

150
0:07:15.325,000 --> 0:07:17,000
are probably overly simplistic.

151
0:07:17.923,000 --> 0:07:2,000
So we're seeing this in all sorts of places in human life.

152
0:07:21.558,000 --> 0:07:23,000
One of the places we're seeing it, for example,

153
0:07:23.787,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in our culture, in the United States today,

154
0:07:25.825,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life.

155
0:07:28.628,000 --> 0:07:29,000
We have difficult conversations

156
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
about at what point we decide a body becomes a human,

157
0:07:33.423,000 --> 0:07:35,000
such that it has a different right than a fetal life.

158
0:07:36.412,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We have very difficult conversations nowadays --

159
0:07:38.96,000 --> 0:07:4,000
probably not out in the open as much as within medicine --

160
0:07:41.733,000 --> 0:07:43,000
about the question of when somebody's dead.

161
0:07:44.006,000 --> 0:07:46,000
In the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much

162
0:07:46.657,000 --> 0:07:48,000
with this question of when somebody was dead.

163
0:07:48.783,000 --> 0:07:5,000
At most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose,

164
0:07:51.199,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet.

165
0:07:53.367,000 --> 0:07:54,000
If it stopped twitching, you bury them.

166
0:07:55.25,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But today, we have a situation

167
0:07:56.71,000 --> 0:07:58,000
where we want to take vital organs out of beings

168
0:07:59.045,000 --> 0:08:,000
and give them to other beings.

169
0:08:00.653,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And as a consequence,

170
0:08:02.136,000 --> 0:08:04,000
we have to struggle with this really difficult question

171
0:08:04.764,000 --> 0:08:05,000
about who's dead,

172
0:08:06.423,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and this leads us to a really difficult situation

173
0:08:08.792,000 --> 0:08:1,000
where we don't have such simple categories as we've had before.

174
0:08:11.792,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Now you might think that all this breaking-down of categories

175
0:08:14.927,000 --> 0:08:15,000
would make somebody like me really happy.

176
0:08:16.937,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies,

177
0:08:20.013,000 --> 0:08:22,000
but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous.

178
0:08:22.472,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Understanding that these categories

179
0:08:24.186,000 --> 0:08:27,000
are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense.

180
0:08:27.303,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy.

181
0:08:30.58,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So in order to tell you about that tension,

182
0:08:32.76,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I have to first admit to you a huge fan of the Founding Fathers.

183
0:08:35.901,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I know they were racists, I know they were sexist,

184
0:08:38.534,000 --> 0:08:39,000
but they were great.

185
0:08:39.731,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I mean, they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did,

186
0:08:44.869,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that I find myself watching that cheesy musical "1776" every few years,

187
0:08:49.363,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and it's not because of the music, which is totally forgettable.

188
0:08:52.391,000 --> 0:08:55,000
It's because of what happened in 1776 with the Founding Fathers.

189
0:08:55.753,000 --> 0:08:57,000
The Founding Fathers were, for my point of view,

190
0:08:58.051,000 --> 0:09:,000
the original anatomical activists,

191
0:09:00.127,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and this is why.

192
0:09:01.756,000 --> 0:09:04,000
What they rejected was an anatomical concept

193
0:09:05.055,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and replaced it with another one

194
0:09:06.615,000 --> 0:09:09,000
that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years.

195
0:09:09.968,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So as you all recall,

196
0:09:11.714,000 --> 0:09:14,000
what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy,

197
0:09:15.142,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.

198
0:09:18.804,000 --> 0:09:21,000
The monarchs of the old world didn't have a concept of DNA,

199
0:09:22.467,000 --> 0:09:24,000
but they did have a concept of birthright.

200
0:09:24.624,000 --> 0:09:25,000
They had a concept of blue blood.

201
0:09:26.32,000 --> 0:09:29,000
They had the idea that the people who would be in political power

202
0:09:29.527,000 --> 0:09:32,000
should be in political power because of the blood being passed down

203
0:09:32.728,000 --> 0:09:35,000
from grandfather to father to son and so forth.

204
0:09:37.054,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The Founding Fathers rejected that idea,

205
0:09:39.446,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept,

206
0:09:42.121,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and that concept was "all men are created equal."

207
0:09:45.978,000 --> 0:09:48,000
They leveled that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered

208
0:09:49.365,000 --> 0:09:53,000
was the commonality of anatomy, not the difference in anatomy,

209
0:09:53.803,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and that was a really radical thing to do.

210
0:09:56.82,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Now they were doing it in part

211
0:09:58.296,000 --> 0:10:,000
because they were part of an Enlightenment system

212
0:10:00.612,000 --> 0:10:02,000
where two things were growing up together.

213
0:10:02.645,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And that was democracy growing up,

214
0:10:04.937,000 --> 0:10:07,000
but it was also science growing up at the same time.

215
0:10:08.026,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And it's really clear, if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers,

216
0:10:11.529,000 --> 0:10:13,000
a lot of them were very interested in science,

217
0:10:13.839,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and they were interested in the concept of a naturalistic world.

218
0:10:16.891,000 --> 0:10:18,000
They were moving away from supernatural explanations,

219
0:10:19.401,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power,

220
0:10:22.662,000 --> 0:10:26,000
where it transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright.

221
0:10:26.741,000 --> 0:10:28,000
They were moving towards a naturalistic concept.

222
0:10:29.047,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And if you look, for example, in the Declaration of Independence,

223
0:10:32.126,000 --> 0:10:34,000
they talk about nature and nature's God.

224
0:10:34.856,000 --> 0:10:36,000
They don't talk about God and God's nature.

225
0:10:37.069,000 --> 0:10:4,000
They're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are.

226
0:10:40.996,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So as part of that, they were coming to us with a concept

227
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that was about anatomical commonality.

228
0:10:46.994,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And in doing so, they were really setting up in a beautiful way

229
0:10:50.147,000 --> 0:10:51,000
the Civil Rights Movement of the future.

230
0:10:52.084,000 --> 0:10:55,000
They didn't think of it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.

231
0:10:55.649,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So what happened years afterwards?

232
0:10:57.316,000 --> 0:11:,000
What happened was women, for example, who wanted the right to vote,

233
0:11:00.782,000 --> 0:11:03,000
took the Founding Fathers' concept of anatomical commonality

234
0:11:04.168,000 --> 0:11:06,000
being more important than anatomical difference

235
0:11:06.399,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and said, "The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries

236
0:11:08.957,000 --> 0:11:1,000
is not significant enough in terms of a difference

237
0:11:11.744,000 --> 0:11:13,000
to mean that we shouldn't have the right to vote,

238
0:11:14.057,000 --> 0:11:17,000
the right to full citizenship, the right to own property, etc."

239
0:11:17.763,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And women successfully argued that.

240
0:11:19.839,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Next came the successful Civil Rights Movement,

241
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
where we found people like Sojourner Truth

242
0:11:24.403,000 --> 0:11:26,000
talking about, "Ain't I a woman?"

243
0:11:26.696,000 --> 0:11:29,000
We find men on the marching lines of the Civil Rights Movement

244
0:11:30.665,000 --> 0:11:31,000
saying, "I am a man."

245
0:11:32.039,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Again, people of color appealing to a commonality of anatomy

246
0:11:36.46,000 --> 0:11:38,000
over a difference of anatomy, again, successfully.

247
0:11:39.174,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We see the same thing with the disability rights movement.

248
0:11:42.552,000 --> 0:11:44,000
The problem is, of course,

249
0:11:44.734,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that, as we begin to look at all that commonality,

250
0:11:47.136,000 --> 0:11:5,000
we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions.

251
0:11:50.585,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Mind you, I want to maintain some divisions,

252
0:11:53.338,000 --> 0:11:54,000
anatomically, in our culture.

253
0:11:55.029,000 --> 0:11:58,000
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.

254
0:11:58.733,000 --> 0:12:,000
I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy.

255
0:12:01.342,000 --> 0:12:02,000
I don't want to say a five-year-old

256
0:12:03.033,000 --> 0:12:05,000
should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry.

257
0:12:05.688,000 --> 0:12:06,000
So there are some anatomical divisions

258
0:12:07.679,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that make sense to me and that I think we should retain.

259
0:12:11.012,000 --> 0:12:13,000
But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are

260
0:12:13.929,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and why do we retain them, and do they have meaning.

261
0:12:16.564,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So let's go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk.

262
0:12:20.378,000 --> 0:12:21,000
We have two beings, both conceived

263
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day.

264
0:12:25.775,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Let's imagine one of them, Mary, is born three months prematurely,

265
0:12:29.549,000 --> 0:12:31,000
so she's born on June 1, 1980.

266
0:12:32.075,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Henry, by contrast, is born at term, so he's born on March 1, 1980.

267
0:12:36.846,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Simply by virtue of the fact

268
0:12:38.662,000 --> 0:12:4,000
that Mary was born prematurely three months,

269
0:12:41.144,000 --> 0:12:45,000
she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does --

270
0:12:45.41,000 --> 0:12:49,000
the right to consent to sex, the right to vote, the right to drink.

271
0:12:49.649,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Henry has to wait for all of that,

272
0:12:51.306,000 --> 0:12:54,000
not because he's actually any different in age, biologically,

273
0:12:54.344,000 --> 0:12:56,000
except in terms of when he was born.

274
0:12:57.249,000 --> 0:13:,000
We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are.

275
0:13:00.433,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Henry, by virtue of being assumed to be male --

276
0:13:02.65,000 --> 0:13:04,000
although I haven't told you that he's the XY one --

277
0:13:05.065,000 --> 0:13:09,000
by virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted,

278
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
which Mary does not need to worry about.

279
0:13:11.224,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Mary, meanwhile, cannot in all the states have the same right

280
0:13:15.021,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that Henry has in all the states,

281
0:13:16.645,000 --> 0:13:17,000
namely, the right to marry.

282
0:13:18.151,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Henry can marry, in every state, a woman,

283
0:13:20.939,000 --> 0:13:23,000
but Mary can only marry today in a few states, a woman.

284
0:13:24.479,000 --> 0:13:26,000
So we have these anatomical categories that persist,

285
0:13:27.396,000 --> 0:13:3,000
that are in many ways problematic and questionable.

286
0:13:31.169,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And the question to me becomes:

287
0:13:32.914,000 --> 0:13:37,000
What do we do, as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy,

288
0:13:38.926,000 --> 0:13:4,000
that we reach the point where we have to admit

289
0:13:41.52,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that a democracy that's been based on anatomy

290
0:13:44.421,000 --> 0:13:45,000
might start falling apart?

291
0:13:47.14,000 --> 0:13:49,000
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time,

292
0:13:49.888,000 --> 0:13:52,000
it feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us.

293
0:13:53.06,000 --> 0:13:54,000
So where do we go?

294
0:13:55.089,000 --> 0:13:59,000
It seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude:

295
0:13:59.194,000 --> 0:14:02,000
"We have to draw the line somewhere, so we will draw the line somewhere."

296
0:14:02.656,000 --> 0:14:04,000
But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position.

297
0:14:05.366,000 --> 0:14:09,000
So for example, Texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man

298
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
is to mean that you don't have a Y chromosome,

299
0:14:12.679,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and what it means to marry a woman means you have a Y chromosome.

300
0:14:15.773,000 --> 0:14:17,000
In practice they don't test people for their chromosomes.

301
0:14:18.519,000 --> 0:14:19,000
But this is also very bizarre,

302
0:14:20.026,000 --> 0:14:22,000
because of the story I told you at the beginning

303
0:14:22.37,000 --> 0:14:23,000
about androgen insensitivity syndrome.

304
0:14:24.204,000 --> 0:14:27,000
If we look at one of the Founding Fathers of modern democracy,

305
0:14:27.76,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Dr. Martin Luther King,

306
0:14:28.964,000 --> 0:14:31,000
he offers us something of a solution in his "I have a dream" speech.

307
0:14:32.191,000 --> 0:14:35,000
He says we should judge people "based not on the color of their skin,

308
0:14:35.482,000 --> 0:14:36,000
but on the content of their character,"

309
0:14:37.377,000 --> 0:14:38,000
moving beyond anatomy.

310
0:14:38.923,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And I want to say, "Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea."

311
0:14:41.926,000 --> 0:14:42,000
But in practice, how do you do it?

312
0:14:43.606,000 --> 0:14:45,000
How do you judge people based on the content of character?

313
0:14:47.093,000 --> 0:14:48,000
I also want to point out

314
0:14:48.269,000 --> 0:14:51,000
that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans,

315
0:14:52.104,000 --> 0:14:55,000
because, I have to admit, that there are some golden retrievers I know

316
0:14:55.431,000 --> 0:14:58,000
that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans I know.

317
0:14:59.032,000 --> 0:15:02,000
I also want to say there are probably also some yellow Labradors that I know

318
0:15:02.651,000 --> 0:15:05,000
that are more capable of informed, intelligent, mature decisions

319
0:15:05.698,000 --> 0:15:07,000
about sexual relations than some 40-year-olds that I know.

320
0:15:08.444,000 --> 0:15:12,000
So how do we operationalize the question of content of character?

321
0:15:12.646,000 --> 0:15:13,000
It turns out to be really difficult.

322
0:15:14.595,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And part of me also wonders,

323
0:15:16.1,000 --> 0:15:17,000
what if content of character

324
0:15:17.996,000 --> 0:15:2,000
turns out to be something that's scannable in the future --

325
0:15:21.981,000 --> 0:15:23,000
able to be seen with an fMRI?

326
0:15:24.314,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Do we really want to go there?

327
0:15:26.36,000 --> 0:15:27,000
I'm not sure where we go.

328
0:15:27.72,000 --> 0:15:29,000
What I do know is that it seems to be really important

329
0:15:30.295,000 --> 0:15:32,000
to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead

330
0:15:33.262,000 --> 0:15:35,000
of thinking about this issue of democracy.

331
0:15:35.29,000 --> 0:15:37,000
We've done a really good job struggling with democracy,

332
0:15:38.025,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and I think we would do a good job in the future.

333
0:15:40.383,000 --> 0:15:42,000
We don't have a situation that Iran has, for example,

334
0:15:43.01,000 --> 0:15:45,000
where a man who's sexually attracted to other men

335
0:15:45.327,000 --> 0:15:46,000
is liable to be murdered,

336
0:15:46.548,000 --> 0:15:48,000
unless he's willing to submit to a sex change,

337
0:15:48.743,000 --> 0:15:49,000
in which case he's allowed to live.

338
0:15:51.168,000 --> 0:15:52,000
We don't have that kind of situation.

339
0:15:52.983,000 --> 0:15:55,000
I'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with --

340
0:15:56.306,000 --> 0:15:57,000
a surgeon I talked to a few years ago

341
0:15:58.313,000 --> 0:16:,000
who had brought over a set of conjoined twins

342
0:16:00.773,000 --> 0:16:02,000
in order to separate them, partly to make a name for himself.

343
0:16:03.708,000 --> 0:16:06,000
But when I was on the phone with him, asking why he'll do this surgery --

344
0:16:07.182,000 --> 0:16:1,000
this was a very high-risk surgery -- his answer was that, in this other nation,

345
0:16:10.932,000 --> 0:16:13,000
these children were going to be treated very badly, and so he had to do this.

346
0:16:14.589,000 --> 0:16:17,000
My response to him was, "Well, have you considered political asylum

347
0:16:17.765,000 --> 0:16:18,000
instead of a separation surgery?"

348
0:16:19.396,000 --> 0:16:21,000
The United States has offered tremendous possibility

349
0:16:21.869,000 --> 0:16:23,000
for allowing people to be the way they are,

350
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state.

351
0:16:27.982,000 --> 0:16:29,000
So I think we have to be in the lead.

352
0:16:30.184,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Well, just to close, I want to suggest to you

353
0:16:32.665,000 --> 0:16:34,000
that I've been talking a lot about the Fathers.

354
0:16:35.22,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And I want to think about the possibilities

355
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
of what democracy might look like, or might have looked like,

356
0:16:40.189,000 --> 0:16:41,000
if we had more involved the mothers.

357
0:16:42.645,000 --> 0:16:45,000
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist,

358
0:16:45.707,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights

359
0:16:49.576,000 --> 0:16:51,000
that can come from different kinds of anatomies,

360
0:16:51.849,000 --> 0:16:53,000
particularly when we have people thinking in groups.

361
0:16:54.495,000 --> 0:16:56,000
For years, because I've been interested in intersex,

362
0:16:57.026,000 --> 0:16:59,000
I've also been interested in sex-difference research.

363
0:16:59.527,000 --> 0:17:01,000
And one of the things that I've been interested in

364
0:17:01.904,000 --> 0:17:03,000
is looking at the differences between males and females

365
0:17:04.53,000 --> 0:17:06,000
in terms of the way they think and operate in the world.

366
0:17:07.193,000 --> 0:17:09,000
And what we know from cross-cultural studies

367
0:17:09.29,000 --> 0:17:1,000
is that females, on average --

368
0:17:11.154,000 --> 0:17:13,000
not everyone, but on average --

369
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations

370
0:17:18.175,000 --> 0:17:19,000
and to taking care of people

371
0:17:19.777,000 --> 0:17:21,000
who are, basically, vulnerable within the group.

372
0:17:22.779,000 --> 0:17:24,000
And so if we think about that,

373
0:17:25.01,000 --> 0:17:27,000
we have an interesting situation in hands.

374
0:17:27.035,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Years ago, when I was in graduate school,

375
0:17:29.025,000 --> 0:17:32,000
one of my graduate advisors who knew I was interested in feminism --

376
0:17:32.246,000 --> 0:17:34,000
I considered myself a feminist, as I still do,

377
0:17:34.506,000 --> 0:17:35,000
asked a really strange question.

378
0:17:36.079,000 --> 0:17:38,000
He said, "Tell me what's feminine about feminism."

379
0:17:39.012,000 --> 0:17:42,000
And I thought, "Well, that's the dumbest question I've ever heard.

380
0:17:42.207,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender,

381
0:17:44.805,000 --> 0:17:46,000
so there's nothing feminine about feminism."

382
0:17:46.891,000 --> 0:17:48,000
But the more I thought about his question,

383
0:17:48.94,000 --> 0:17:51,000
the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism.

384
0:17:52.182,000 --> 0:17:54,000
That is to say, there might be something, on average,

385
0:17:54.915,000 --> 0:17:56,000
different about female brains from male brains

386
0:17:57.811,000 --> 0:18:02,000
that makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships,

387
0:18:02.899,000 --> 0:18:04,000
and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable.

388
0:18:05.756,000 --> 0:18:07,000
So whereas the Fathers were extremely attentive

389
0:18:08.283,000 --> 0:18:11,000
to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state,

390
0:18:12.118,000 --> 0:18:15,000
it's possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept,

391
0:18:15.987,000 --> 0:18:18,000
what we would have is more of a concept of not just how to protect,

392
0:18:19.617,000 --> 0:18:21,000
but how to care for each other.

393
0:18:21.961,000 --> 0:18:23,000
And maybe that's where we need to go in the future,

394
0:18:24.558,000 --> 0:18:26,000
when we take democracy beyond anatomy,

395
0:18:26.789,000 --> 0:18:29,000
is to think less about the individual body in terms of the identity,

396
0:18:30.348,000 --> 0:18:32,000
and think more about those relationships.

397
0:18:32.722,000 --> 0:18:35,000
So that as we the people try to create a more perfect union,

398
0:18:36.211,000 --> 0:18:38,000
we're thinking about what we do for each other.

399
0:18:39.128,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Thank you.

400
0:18:40.303,000 --> 0:18:42,000
(Applause)

The history of civilization, in some ways, is a history of maps:

3
0:00:16.285,000 --> 0:00:18,000
How have we come to understand the world around us?

4
0:00:19.008,000 --> 0:00:23,000
One of the most famous maps works because it really isn't a map at all.

0:00:23.288,000 --> 0:00:25,000

[Michael Bierut on the London Tube Map]

7
0:00:29.707,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The London Underground came together in 1908,

8
0:00:32.565,000 --> 0:00:34,000
when eight different independent railways merged

9
0:00:35.361,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to create a single system.

10
0:00:37.104,000 --> 0:00:39,000
They needed a map to represent that system

11
0:00:39.359,000 --> 0:00:4,000
so people would know where to ride.

12
0:00:41.105,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The map they made is complicated.

13
0:00:44.186,000 --> 0:00:46,000
You can see rivers, bodies of water, trees and parks --

14
0:00:47.162,000 --> 0:00:5,000
the stations were all crammed together at the center of the map,

15
0:00:50.245,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and out in the periphery, there were some that couldn't even fit on the map.

16
0:00:53.87,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So the map was geographically accurate, but maybe not so useful.

17
0:00:58.066,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Enter Harry Beck.

18
0:00:59.892,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Harry Beck was a 29-year-old engineering draftsman

19
0:01:03.384,000 --> 0:01:05,000
who had been working on and off for the London Underground.

20
0:01:06.2,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And he had a key insight,

21
0:01:07.469,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and that was that people riding underground in trains

22
0:01:11.121,000 --> 0:01:13,000
don't really care what's happening aboveground.

23
0:01:13.811,000 --> 0:01:15,000
They just want to get from station to station --

24
0:01:16.32,000 --> 0:01:17,000
"Where do I get on? Where do I get off?"

25
0:01:18.328,000 --> 0:01:2,000
It's the system that's important, not the geography.

26
0:01:21.09,000 --> 0:01:23,000
He's taken this complicated mess of spaghetti,

27
0:01:24.002,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and he's simplified it.

28
0:01:25.795,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The lines only go in three directions:

29
0:01:27.777,000 --> 0:01:3,000
they're horizontal, they're vertical, or they're 45 degrees.

30
0:01:31.121,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Likewise, he spaced the stations equally,

31
0:01:34.113,000 --> 0:01:37,000
he's made every station color correspond to the color of the line,

32
0:01:38.073,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and he's fixed it all so that it's not really a map anymore.

33
0:01:42.247,000 --> 0:01:43,000
What it is is a diagram,

34
0:01:44.168,000 --> 0:01:45,000
just like circuitry,

35
0:01:45.427,000 --> 0:01:48,000
except the circuitry here isn't wires conducting electrons,

36
0:01:49.144,000 --> 0:01:53,000
it's tubes containing trains conducting people from place to place.

37
0:01:53.835,000 --> 0:01:58,000
In 1933, the Underground decided, at last, to give Harry Beck's map a try.

38
0:01:59.176,000 --> 0:02:02,000
The Underground did a test run of a thousand of these maps, pocket-size.

39
0:02:02.636,000 --> 0:02:03,000
They were gone in one hour.

40
0:02:04.017,000 --> 0:02:05,000
They realized they were onto something,

41
0:02:05.954,000 --> 0:02:07,000
they printed 750,000 more,

42
0:02:08.47,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and this is the map that you see today.

43
0:02:10.933,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Beck's design really became the template

44
0:02:13.459,000 --> 0:02:15,000
for the way we think of metro maps today.

45
0:02:15.931,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Tokyo, Paris, Berlin, São Paulo, Sydney, Washington, D.C. --

46
0:02:20.789,000 --> 0:02:22,000
all of them convert complex geography

47
0:02:23.387,000 --> 0:02:24,000
into crisp geometry.

48
0:02:25.08,000 --> 0:02:28,000
All of them use different colors to distinguish between lines,

49
0:02:28.541,000 --> 0:02:32,000
all of them use simple symbols to distinguish between types of stations.

50
0:02:32.773,000 --> 0:02:34,000
They all are part of a universal language, seemingly.

51
0:02:35.804,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I bet Harry Beck wouldn't have known what a user interface was,

52
0:02:39.601,000 --> 0:02:41,000
but that's really what he designed

53
0:02:41.803,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and he really took that challenge and broke it down to three principles

54
0:02:45.167,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that I think can be applied in nearly any design problem.

55
0:02:47.863,000 --> 0:02:48,000
First one is focus.

56
0:02:49.143,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Focus on who you're doing this for.

57
0:02:51.501,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The second principle is simplicity.

58
0:02:53.553,000 --> 0:02:55,000
What's the shortest way to deliver that need?

59
0:02:56.49,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Finally, the last thing is:

60
0:02:58.338,000 --> 0:03:,000
Thinking in a cross-disciplinary way.

61
0:03:00.642,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Who would've thought that an electrical engineer

62
0:03:03.459,000 --> 0:03:05,000
would be the person to hold the key

63
0:03:05.87,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to unlock what was then one of the most complicated systems in the world --

64
0:03:10.028,000 --> 0:03:12,000
all started by one guy with a pencil and an idea.

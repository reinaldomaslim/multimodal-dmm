0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I got a visit almost exactly a year ago,

2
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:33,000
a little over a year ago, from a very senior person at the Department of Defense.

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Came to see me and said, "1,600 of the kids that we've sent out

4
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:43,000
have come back missing at least one full arm.

5
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Whole arm. Shoulder disarticulation.

6
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And we're doing the same thing we did for -- more or less,

7
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that we've done since the Civil War, a stick and a hook.

8
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And they deserve more than that."

9
0:00:56,000 --> 0:01:,000
And literally, this guy sat in my office in New Hampshire and said,

10
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:03,000
"I want you to give me something that we can put on these kids

11
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that'll pick up a raisin or a grape off a table,

12
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:12,000
they'll be able to put it in their mouth without destroying either one,

13
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and they'll be able to know the difference without looking at it."

14
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:2,000
You know, had efferent, afferent, and haptic response.

15
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:25,000
He finishes explaining that, and I'm waiting for the big 300 pound paper proposal,

16
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and he said, "That's what I want from you."

17
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I said, "Look, you're nuts. That technology's just not available right now.

18
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And it can't be done.

19
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Not in an envelope of a human arm,

20
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:45,000
with 21 degrees of freedom, from your shoulder to your fingertips."

21
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:53,000
He said, "About two dozen of these 1,600 kids have come back bilateral.

22
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:54,000
You think it's bad to lose one arm?

23
0:01:54,000 --> 0:02:02,000
That's an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone."

24
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I got a day job,

25
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like,

26
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:11,000
let's supply water to the world, and power to the world, and educate all the kids,

27
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:19,000
which, Chris, I will not talk about. I don't need another mission.

28
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I keep thinking about these kids with no arms.

29
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
He says to me, "We've done some work around the country.

30
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
We've got some pretty amazing neurology and other people."

31
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I said, "I'll take a field trip, I'll go see what you got."

32
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Over the next month I visited lots of places, some out here, around the country,

33
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:39,000
found the best of the best.

34
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I went down to Washington. I saw these guys, and said,

35
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:45,000
"I did what you asked me. I looked at what's out there.

36
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I still think you're nuts. But not as nuts as I thought."

37
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I put a team together, a little over 13 months ago,

38
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:57,000
got up to 20 some-odd people.

39
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:,000
We said, we're going to build a device that does what he wants.

40
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:03,000
We have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom;

41
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:05,000
you don't need the ones in the last two fingers.

42
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We put this thing together.

43
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:1,000
A couple of weeks ago we took it down to Walter Reed,

44
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:12,000
which is unfortunately more in the news these days.

45
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We showed it to a bunch of guys.

46
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:16,000
One guy who described himself as being lucky,

47
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
because he lost his left arm, and he's a righty.

48
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:24,000
He sat at a table with seven or eight of these other guys.

49
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Said he was lucky, because he had his good arm,

50
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and then he pushed himself back from the table. He had no legs.

51
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:34,000
These kids have attitudes that you just can't believe.

52
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So I'm going to show you now, without the skin on it,

53
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:39,000
a 30-second piece, and then I'm done.

54
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But understand what you're looking at

55
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:46,000
we made small enough to fit on a 50th percentile female,

56
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:5,000
so that we could put it in any of these people.

57
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It's going to go inside something that we use in CAT scans and

58
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:55,000
MRIs of whatever is their good arm,

59
0:03:55,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to make silicon rubber, then coat it, and paint it in 3D --

60
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:04,000
exact mirror image of their other limb.

61
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So, you won't see all the really cool stuff that's in this series elastic set of 14 actuators,

62
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:13,000
each one which has its own capability to sense temperature and pressure.

63
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:15,000
It also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on,

64
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:19,000
so the more they put themselves under load, the more it attaches.

65
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:22,000
They take the load off, and it becomes, again, compliant.

66
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I'm going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this

67
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that we demonstrated in Washington. Can we look at this thing?

68
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Watch the fingers grab. The thumb comes up. Wrist.

69
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:45,000
This weighs 6.9 pounds.

70
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Going to scratch his nose.

71
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:52,000
It's got 14 active degrees of freedom.

72
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Now he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger.

73
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Now he's going to put that down, pick up a piece of paper,

74
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:1,000
rotate all the degrees of freedom in his hand and wrist, and read it.

75
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.188,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So I'm here to tell you that we have a problem with boys,

2
0:00:19.383,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and it's a serious problem with boys.

3
0:00:22.017,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Their culture isn't working in schools,

4
0:00:24.669,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and I'm going to share with you ways

5
0:00:26.471,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that we can think about overcoming that problem.

6
0:00:29.565,000 --> 0:00:31,000
First, I want to start by saying, this is a boy,

7
0:00:32.555,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and this is a girl,

8
0:00:35.101,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl.

9
0:00:38.673,000 --> 0:00:41,000
If I essentialize gender for you today, then you can dismiss what I have to say.

10
0:00:42.48,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So I'm not going to do that, I'm not interested in doing that.

11
0:00:45.468,000 --> 0:00:48,000
This is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl.

12
0:00:48.709,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries

13
0:00:53.166,000 --> 0:00:55,000
of what we think of as boys and girls,

14
0:00:55.38,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and not all girls exist within those rigid boundaries

15
0:00:57.959,000 --> 0:00:58,000
of what we think of as girls.

16
0:00:59.375,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But, in fact, most boys tend to be a certain way,

17
0:01:03.124,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and most girls tend to be a certain way.

18
0:01:05.125,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And the point is that, for boys,

19
0:01:07.388,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the way that they exist and the culture that they embrace

20
0:01:10.598,000 --> 0:01:12,000
isn't working well in schools now.

21
0:01:13.13,000 --> 0:01:14,000
How do we know that?

22
0:01:14.378,000 --> 0:01:18,000
The 100 girls project tells us some really nice statistics.

23
0:01:19.161,000 --> 0:01:22,000
For example, for every 100 girls that are suspended from school,

24
0:01:22.698,000 --> 0:01:24,000
there are 250 boys that are suspended from school.

25
0:01:25.642,000 --> 0:01:27,000
For every 100 girls who are expelled from school,

26
0:01:27.989,000 --> 0:01:29,000
there are 335 boys who are expelled from school.

27
0:01:31.34,000 --> 0:01:33,000
For every 100 girls in special education,

28
0:01:33.711,000 --> 0:01:34,000
there are 217 boys.

29
0:01:35.902,000 --> 0:01:37,000
For every 100 girls with a learning disability,

30
0:01:38.127,000 --> 0:01:39,000
there are 276 boys.

31
0:01:40.545,000 --> 0:01:44,000
For every 100 girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed,

32
0:01:45.031,000 --> 0:01:46,000
we have 324 boys.

33
0:01:46.825,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And by the way, all of these numbers are significantly higher

34
0:01:50.425,000 --> 0:01:51,000
if you happen to be black,

35
0:01:51.869,000 --> 0:01:52,000
if you happen to be poor,

36
0:01:53.736,000 --> 0:01:55,000
if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school.

37
0:01:57.509,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And if you are a boy,

38
0:01:59.654,000 --> 0:02:02,000
you're four times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD --

39
0:02:03.414,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

40
0:02:06.339,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Now there is another side to this.

41
0:02:09.424,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And it is important that we recognize that women still need help in school,

42
0:02:15.058,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that salaries are still significantly lower,

43
0:02:17.345,000 --> 0:02:19,000
even when controlled for job types,

44
0:02:19.667,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and that girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years.

45
0:02:23.974,000 --> 0:02:24,000
That's all true.

46
0:02:25.154,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Nothing about that prevents us

47
0:02:27.457,000 --> 0:02:29,000
from paying attention to the literacy needs

48
0:02:29.515,000 --> 0:02:31,000
of our boys between ages three and 13.

49
0:02:32.109,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And so we should.

50
0:02:33.285,000 --> 0:02:36,000
In fact, what we ought to do is take a page from their playbook,

51
0:02:36.332,000 --> 0:02:4,000
because the initiatives and programs that have been set in place

52
0:02:40.603,000 --> 0:02:43,000
for women in science and engineering and mathematics are fantastic.

53
0:02:44.468,000 --> 0:02:47,000
They've done a lot of good for girls in these situations,

54
0:02:48.422,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too

55
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in their younger years.

56
0:02:54.36,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Even in their older years,

57
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
what we find is that there's still a problem.

58
0:02:58.771,000 --> 0:02:59,000
When we look at the universities,

59
0:03:00.38,000 --> 0:03:02,000
60 percent of baccalaureate degrees are going to women now,

60
0:03:03.402,000 --> 0:03:04,000
which is a significant shift.

61
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And in fact, university administrators are a little uncomfortable about the idea

62
0:03:09.155,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that we may be getting close to 70 percent female population in universities.

63
0:03:14.084,000 --> 0:03:16,000
This makes university administrators very nervous,

64
0:03:16.458,000 --> 0:03:19,000
because girls don't want to go to schools that don't have boys.

65
0:03:21.79,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And so we're starting to see

66
0:03:23.912,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the establishment of men centers and men studies

67
0:03:27.093,000 --> 0:03:31,000
to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university.

68
0:03:31.394,000 --> 0:03:33,000
If you talk to faculty, they may say, "Ugh. Yeah, well,

69
0:03:34.195,000 --> 0:03:35,000
they're playing video games,

70
0:03:35.767,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and they're gambling online all night long,

71
0:03:38.76,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and they're playing World of Warcraft,

72
0:03:40.599,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and that's affecting their academic achievement."

73
0:03:45.72,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Guess what?

74
0:03:46.925,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Video games are not the cause.

75
0:03:49.42,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Video games are a symptom.

76
0:03:51.741,000 --> 0:03:55,000
They were turned off a long time before they got here.

77
0:03:56.387,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So let's talk about why they got turned off

78
0:03:59.07,000 --> 0:04:01,000
when they were between the ages of three and 13.

79
0:04:02.45,000 --> 0:04:03,000
There are three reasons that I believe

80
0:04:04.353,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that boys are out of sync with the culture of schools today.

81
0:04:08.014,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The first is zero tolerance.

82
0:04:10.627,000 --> 0:04:15,000
A kindergarten teacher I know, her son donated all of his toys to her,

83
0:04:15.668,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and when he did, she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns.

84
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
You can't have plastic knives and swords and axes

85
0:04:24.778,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and all that kind of thing in a kindergarten classroom.

86
0:04:27.945,000 --> 0:04:3,000
What is it that we're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun?

87
0:04:31.844,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I mean, really.

88
0:04:33.918,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But here he stands as testament

89
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to the fact that you can't roughhouse on the playground today.

90
0:04:39.56,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Now I'm not advocating for bullies.

91
0:04:41.593,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I'm not suggesting that we need to be allowing guns and knives in the school.

92
0:04:46.82,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But when we say that an Eagle Scout in a high school classroom

93
0:04:51.1,000 --> 0:04:54,000
who has a locked parked car in the parking lot and a penknife in it,

94
0:04:54.449,000 --> 0:04:56,000
has to be suspended from school,

95
0:04:56.496,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I think we may have gone a little too far with zero tolerance.

96
0:04:59.82,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Another way that zero tolerance lives itself out

97
0:05:02.172,000 --> 0:05:03,000
is in the writing of boys.

98
0:05:03.487,000 --> 0:05:04,000
In a lot of classrooms today,

99
0:05:04.896,000 --> 0:05:06,000
you're not allowed to write about anything that's violent.

100
0:05:07.64,000 --> 0:05:1,000
You're not allowed to write about anything that has to do with video games.

101
0:05:11.19,000 --> 0:05:12,000
These topics are banned.

102
0:05:12.384,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Boy comes home from school, and he says,

103
0:05:14.356,000 --> 0:05:15,000
"I hate writing."

104
0:05:15.83,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"Why do you hate writing, son? What's wrong with writing?"

105
0:05:18.581,000 --> 0:05:2,000
"Now I have to write what she tells me to write."

106
0:05:20.918,000 --> 0:05:22,000
"OK, what is she telling you to write?"

107
0:05:23.363,000 --> 0:05:25,000
"Poems. I have to write poems.

108
0:05:25.748,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And little moments in my life.

109
0:05:27.768,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I don't want to write that stuff."

110
0:05:30.14,000 --> 0:05:31,000
"Well, what do you want to write?

111
0:05:31.806,000 --> 0:05:32,000
What do you want to write about?"

112
0:05:33.421,000 --> 0:05:36,000
"I want to write about video games. I want to write about leveling-up.

113
0:05:36.734,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I want to write about this really interesting world.

114
0:05:39.196,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I want to write about a tornado that comes into our house

115
0:05:42.049,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and blows all the windows out,

116
0:05:43.585,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and ruins all the furniture and kills everybody."

117
0:05:45.915,000 --> 0:05:46,000
"All right. OK."

118
0:05:47.41,000 --> 0:05:5,000
You tell a teacher that, and they'll ask you, in all seriousness,

119
0:05:51.157,000 --> 0:05:53,000
"Should we send this child to the psychologist?"

120
0:05:54.877,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And the answer is no, he's just a boy.

121
0:05:57.772,000 --> 0:05:58,000
He's just a little boy.

122
0:06:00.436,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It's not OK to write these kinds of things in classrooms today.

123
0:06:05.094,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So that's the first reason:

124
0:06:06.413,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Zero tolerance policies and the way they're lived out.

125
0:06:08.986,000 --> 0:06:11,000
The next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures:

126
0:06:12.491,000 --> 0:06:13,000
there are fewer male teachers.

127
0:06:13.952,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Anybody who's over 15 doesn't know what this means,

128
0:06:16.735,000 --> 0:06:17,000
because in the last 10 years,

129
0:06:18.515,000 --> 0:06:21,000
the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half.

130
0:06:22.332,000 --> 0:06:25,000
We went from 14 percent to seven percent.

131
0:06:26.2,000 --> 0:06:28,000
That means that 93 percent of the teachers

132
0:06:28.547,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that our young men get in elementary classrooms are women.

133
0:06:32.743,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Now what's the problem with this?

134
0:06:34.997,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Women are great, yep, absolutely.

135
0:06:37.6,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart --

136
0:06:42.066,000 --> 0:06:45,000
they've got dads, they've got pastors, they've got Cub Scout leaders,

137
0:06:45.692,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but ultimately, six hours a day, five days a week

138
0:06:48.8,000 --> 0:06:5,000
they're spending in a classroom,

139
0:06:51.07,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist.

140
0:06:54.458,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And so they say, I guess this really isn't a place for boys.

141
0:06:58.383,000 --> 0:06:59,000
This is a place for girls.

142
0:07:00.075,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And I'm not very good at this,

143
0:07:01.689,000 --> 0:07:04,000
so I guess I'd better go play video games

144
0:07:04.921,000 --> 0:07:06,000
or get into sports, or something like that,

145
0:07:06.956,000 --> 0:07:07,000
because I obviously don't belong here.

146
0:07:08.862,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Men don't belong here, that's pretty obvious.

147
0:07:10.996,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So that may be a very direct way that we see it happen.

148
0:07:15.332,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But less directly, the lack of male presence in the culture --

149
0:07:19.757,000 --> 0:07:22,000
you've got a teachers' lounge, and they're having a conversation

150
0:07:22.971,000 --> 0:07:26,000
about Joey and Johnny who beat each other up on the playground.

151
0:07:27.122,000 --> 0:07:29,000
"What are we going to do with these boys?"

152
0:07:29.15,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The answer to that question changes

153
0:07:30.858,000 --> 0:07:32,000
depending on who's sitting around that table.

154
0:07:32.983,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Are there men around that table?

155
0:07:34.567,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Are there moms who've raised boys around that table?

156
0:07:37.041,000 --> 0:07:38,000
You'll see, the conversation changes

157
0:07:38.807,000 --> 0:07:4,000
depending upon who's sitting around the table.

158
0:07:40.979,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Third reason that boys are out of sync with school today:

159
0:07:43.855,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Kindergarten is the old second grade, folks.

160
0:07:46.323,000 --> 0:07:49,000
We have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there.

161
0:07:50.592,000 --> 0:07:53,000
When you're three, you better be able to write your name legibly,

162
0:07:53.709,000 --> 0:07:55,000
or else we'll consider it a developmental delay.

163
0:07:56.754,000 --> 0:07:57,000
By the time you're in first grade,

164
0:07:58.421,000 --> 0:08:,000
you should be able to read paragraphs of text

165
0:08:01.05,000 --> 0:08:04,000
with maybe a picture, maybe not, in a book of maybe 25 to 30 pages.

166
0:08:04.554,000 --> 0:08:05,000
If you don't,

167
0:08:05.758,000 --> 0:08:08,000
we're probably going to be putting you into a Title I special reading program.

168
0:08:09.457,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And if you ask Title I teachers, they'll tell you

169
0:08:11.779,000 --> 0:08:14,000
they've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program,

170
0:08:15.422,000 --> 0:08:16,000
in the elementary grades.

171
0:08:16.65,000 --> 0:08:17,000
The reason that this is a problem

172
0:08:18.428,000 --> 0:08:21,000
is because the message that boys are getting

173
0:08:21.505,000 --> 0:08:25,000
is, "You need to do what the teacher asks you to do all the time."

174
0:08:26.352,000 --> 0:08:3,000
The teacher's salary depends on "No Child Left Behind"

175
0:08:30.536,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and "Race to the Top" and accountability and testing

176
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and all of this.

177
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So she has to figure out a way to get all these boys

178
0:08:39.258,000 --> 0:08:41,000
through this curriculum -- and girls.

179
0:08:43.142,000 --> 0:08:46,000
This compressed curriculum is bad for all active kids.

180
0:08:47.746,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And what happens is,

181
0:08:49.59,000 --> 0:08:53,000
she says, "Please, sit down, be quiet, do what you're told,

182
0:08:54.274,000 --> 0:08:58,000
follow the rules, manage your time, focus, be a girl."

183
0:09:00.569,000 --> 0:09:01,000
That's what she tells them.

184
0:09:02.151,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Indirectly, that's what she tells them.

185
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And so this is a very serious problem.

186
0:09:06.344,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Where is it coming from? It's coming from us.

187
0:09:08.725,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Laughter)

188
0:09:11.992,000 --> 0:09:13,000
We want our babies to read when they are six months old.

189
0:09:14.984,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Have you seen the ads?

190
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
We want to live in Lake Wobegon where every child is above average ...

191
0:09:21.658,000 --> 0:09:24,000
but what this does to our children is really not healthy.

192
0:09:25.126,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It's not developmentally appropriate,

193
0:09:26.96,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and it's particularly bad for boys.

194
0:09:29.404,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So what do we do?

195
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
We need to meet them where they are.

196
0:09:32.909,000 --> 0:09:34,000
We need to put ourselves into boy culture.

197
0:09:35.197,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We need to change the mindset of acceptance in boys

198
0:09:40.476,000 --> 0:09:41,000
in elementary schools.

199
0:09:42.428,000 --> 0:09:45,000
More specifically, we can do some very specific things.

200
0:09:45.648,000 --> 0:09:46,000
We can design better games.

201
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Most of the educational games that are out there today

202
0:09:50.099,000 --> 0:09:51,000
are really flashcards.

203
0:09:51.648,000 --> 0:09:52,000
They're glorified drill and practice.

204
0:09:53.614,000 --> 0:09:55,000
They don't have the depth, the rich narrative

205
0:09:56.451,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that really engaging video games have,

206
0:09:59.227,000 --> 0:10:01,000
that the boys are really interested in.

207
0:10:01.254,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So we need to design better games.

208
0:10:02.92,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians.

209
0:10:06.77,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We need to make sure that people see that we need more men in the classroom.

210
0:10:10.37,000 --> 0:10:12,000
We need to look carefully at our zero tolerance policies.

211
0:10:13.088,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Do they make sense?

212
0:10:14.28,000 --> 0:10:17,000
We need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can,

213
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
trying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them.

214
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
All of those conversations need to be happening.

215
0:10:24.57,000 --> 0:10:26,000
There are some great examples out there of schools --

216
0:10:27.397,000 --> 0:10:3,000
the New York Times just talked about a school recently.

217
0:10:30.904,000 --> 0:10:32,000
A game designer from the New School

218
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
put together a wonderful video gaming school.

219
0:10:36.652,000 --> 0:10:4,000
But it only treats a few kids, and so this isn't very scalable.

220
0:10:41.513,000 --> 0:10:43,000
We have to change the culture and the feelings

221
0:10:43.693,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that politicians and school board members and parents have

222
0:10:48.539,000 --> 0:10:51,000
about the way we accept and what we accept in our schools today.

223
0:10:51.63,000 --> 0:10:53,000
We need to find more money for game design.

224
0:10:53.663,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Because good games, really good games, cost money,

225
0:10:56.041,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and World of Warcraft has quite a budget.

226
0:10:58.052,000 --> 0:11:,000
Most of the educational games do not.

227
0:11:00.168,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Where we started:

228
0:11:01.44,000 --> 0:11:03,000
my colleagues Mike Petner, Shawn Vashaw, myself,

229
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
we started by trying to look at the teachers' attitudes

230
0:11:06.875,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and find out how do they really feel about gaming,

231
0:11:09.244,000 --> 0:11:1,000
what do they say about it.

232
0:11:10.528,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school,

233
0:11:15.526,000 --> 0:11:17,000
who talk about gaming, in pretty demeaning ways.

234
0:11:18.792,000 --> 0:11:21,000
They say, "Oh, yeah. They're always talking about that stuff.

235
0:11:22.009,000 --> 0:11:24,000
They're talking about their little action figures

236
0:11:24.357,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and their little achievements or merit badges,

237
0:11:26.769,000 --> 0:11:28,000
or whatever it is that they get.

238
0:11:28.851,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And they're always talking about this stuff."

239
0:11:30.977,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And they say these things as if it's OK.

240
0:11:32.958,000 --> 0:11:35,000
But if it were your culture, think of how that might feel.

241
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
It's very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end

242
0:11:38.665,000 --> 0:11:4,000
of that kind of language.

243
0:11:41.236,000 --> 0:11:44,000
They're nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence

244
0:11:44.476,000 --> 0:11:45,000
because of the zero tolerance policies.

245
0:11:46.385,000 --> 0:11:48,000
They are sure that parents and administrators

246
0:11:48.52,000 --> 0:11:49,000
will never accept anything.

247
0:11:49.842,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes

248
0:11:52.75,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and finding ways to change the attitudes,

249
0:11:55.536,000 --> 0:11:58,000
so that teachers are much more open and accepting of boy cultures

250
0:11:59.53,000 --> 0:12:,000
in their classrooms.

251
0:12:00.744,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Because, ultimately, if we don't,

252
0:12:02.836,000 --> 0:12:05,000
then we're going to have boys who leave elementary school saying,

253
0:12:06.132,000 --> 0:12:09,000
"Well I guess that was just a place for girls, it wasn't for me.

254
0:12:09.184,000 --> 0:12:11,000
So I've got to do gaming, or I've got to do sports."

255
0:12:12.416,000 --> 0:12:15,000
If we change these things, if we pay attention to these things,

256
0:12:15.453,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and we reengage boys in their learning,

257
0:12:17.396,000 --> 0:12:2,000
they will leave the elementary schools saying, "I'm smart."

258
0:12:21.394,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Thank you.

259
0:12:22.569,000 --> 0:12:24,000
(Applause)

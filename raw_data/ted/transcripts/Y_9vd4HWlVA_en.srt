0:00:16.162,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Doc Edgerton inspired us with awe and curiosity

3
0:00:22.14,000 --> 0:00:27,000
with this photo of a bullet piercing through an apple,

4
0:00:27.402,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and exposure just a millionth of a second.

5
0:00:32.921,000 --> 0:00:38,000
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster

6
0:00:39.834,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and see the world not at a million or a billion,

7
0:00:44.62,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but one trillion frames per second.

8
0:00:49.125,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I present to you a new type of photography,

9
0:00:52.813,000 --> 0:00:54,000
femto-photography,

10
0:00:54.872,000 --> 0:00:58,000
a new imaging technique so fast

11
0:00:59.472,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion.

12
0:01:04.673,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And with that, we can create cameras that can look around corners,

13
0:01:09.556,000 --> 0:01:1,000
beyond line of sight,

14
0:01:11.553,000 --> 0:01:15,000
or see inside our body without an x-ray,

15
0:01:16.433,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and really challenge what we mean by a camera.

16
0:01:21.7,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off

17
0:01:24.858,000 --> 0:01:26,000
in one trillionth of a second --

18
0:01:27.685,000 --> 0:01:29,000
which is several femtoseconds --

19
0:01:30.496,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide.

20
0:01:35.62,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And that packet of photons, that bullet,

21
0:01:38.053,000 --> 0:01:39,000
will travel at the speed of light,

22
0:01:40.003,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and again, a million times faster than an ordinary bullet.

23
0:01:44.882,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Now, if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons

24
0:01:49.417,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and fire into this bottle,

25
0:01:52.773,000 --> 0:01:55,000
how will those photons shatter into this bottle?

26
0:01:57.124,000 --> 0:01:59,000
How does light look in slow motion?

27
0:01:59.812,000 --> 0:02:02,000
[Light in Slow Motion ... 10 Billion x Slow]

28
0:02:21.301,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Now, the whole event --

29
0:02:22.872,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Applause)

30
0:02:29.883,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Now remember, the whole event is effectively taking place

31
0:02:33.408,000 --> 0:02:34,000
in less than a nanosecond --

32
0:02:35.095,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that's how much time it takes for light to travel.

33
0:02:37.52,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But I'm slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion,

34
0:02:42.191,000 --> 0:02:44,000
so you can see the light in motion.

35
0:02:44.763,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:45.857,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But Coca-Cola did not sponsor this research.

37
0:02:48.168,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:50.294,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Now, there's a lot going on in this movie,

39
0:02:52.341,000 --> 0:02:54,000
so let me break this down and show you what's going on.

40
0:02:54.985,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So the pulse enters the bottle, our bullet,

41
0:02:57.943,000 --> 0:02:59,000
with a packet of photons that start traveling through

42
0:03:00.505,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and that start scattering inside.

43
0:03:02.342,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Some of the light leaks, goes on the table,

44
0:03:04.573,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and you start seeing these ripples of waves.

45
0:03:07.209,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Many of the photons eventually reach the cap

46
0:03:10.241,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and then they explode in various directions.

47
0:03:13.155,000 --> 0:03:14,000
As you can see, there's a bubble of air

48
0:03:15.067,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and it's bouncing around inside.

49
0:03:16.733,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Meanwhile, the ripples are traveling on the table,

50
0:03:19.207,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and because of the reflections at the top,

51
0:03:21.231,000 --> 0:03:24,000
you see at the back of the bottle, after several frames,

52
0:03:25.002,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the reflections are focused.

53
0:03:28.47,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Now, if you take an ordinary bullet

54
0:03:33.883,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and let it go the same distance and slow down the video --

55
0:03:36.907,000 --> 0:03:38,000
again, by a factor of 10 billion --

56
0:03:39.152,000 --> 0:03:43,000
do you know how long you'll have to sit here to watch that movie?

57
0:03:43.569,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:45.181,000 --> 0:03:48,000
A day, a week? Actually, a whole year.

59
0:03:49.569,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It'll be a very boring movie --

60
0:03:51.85,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Laughter)

61
0:03:53.265,000 --> 0:03:56,000
of a slow, ordinary bullet in motion.

62
0:03:57.96,000 --> 0:04:,000
And what about some still-life photography?

63
0:04:08.372,000 --> 0:04:12,000
You can watch the ripples, again, washing over the table,

64
0:04:13.382,000 --> 0:04:15,000
the tomato and the wall in the back.

65
0:04:16.064,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It's like throwing a stone in a pond of water.

66
0:04:22.663,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I thought: this is how nature paints a photo,

67
0:04:26.347,000 --> 0:04:28,000
one femto frame at a time,

68
0:04:28.934,000 --> 0:04:32,000
but of course our eye sees an integral composite.

69
0:04:35.183,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But if you look at this tomato one more time,

70
0:04:37.341,000 --> 0:04:39,000
you will notice, as the light washes over the tomato,

71
0:04:40.11,000 --> 0:04:41,000
it continues to glow.

72
0:04:41.798,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It doesn't become dark. Why is that?

73
0:04:43.849,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Because the tomato is actually ripe,

74
0:04:46.171,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato,

75
0:04:48.584,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and it comes out after several trillionths of a second.

76
0:04:52.974,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So in the future, when this femto-camera is in your camera phone,

77
0:04:57.337,000 --> 0:04:58,000
you might be able to go to a supermarket

78
0:04:59.315,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it.

79
0:05:02.394,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Laughter)

80
0:05:04.104,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So how did my team at MIT create this camera?

81
0:05:09.166,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Now, as photographers, you know,

82
0:05:11.134,000 --> 0:05:14,000
if you take a short exposure photo, you get very little light.

83
0:05:15.119,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But we're going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure,

84
0:05:18.651,000 --> 0:05:19,000
so you're going to get hardly any light.

85
0:05:20.604,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So what we do is we send that bullet --

86
0:05:22.541,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that packet of photons -- millions of times,

87
0:05:25.061,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and record again and again with very clever synchronization,

88
0:05:28.168,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and from the gigabytes of data,

89
0:05:30.131,000 --> 0:05:32,000
we computationally weave together

90
0:05:32.375,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to create those femto-videos I showed you.

91
0:05:36.456,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways.

92
0:05:41.275,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So, Superman can fly.

93
0:05:43.116,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Some other heroes can become invisible.

94
0:05:45.87,000 --> 0:05:49,000
But what about a new power for a future superhero:

95
0:05:50.676,000 --> 0:05:51,000
To see around corners.

96
0:05:53.354,000 --> 0:05:57,000
The idea is that we could shine some light on the door,

97
0:05:57.847,000 --> 0:05:59,000
it's going to bounce, go inside the room,

98
0:06:00.522,000 --> 0:06:02,000
some of that is going to reflect back on the door,

99
0:06:02.952,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and then back to the camera.

100
0:06:04.459,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And we could exploit these multiple bounces of light.

101
0:06:07.947,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And it's not science fiction. We have actually built it.

102
0:06:10.638,000 --> 0:06:12,000
On the left, you see our femto-camera.

103
0:06:12.728,000 --> 0:06:14,000
There's a mannequin hidden behind a wall,

104
0:06:15.107,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and we're going to bounce light off the door.

105
0:06:18.009,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So after our paper was published in Nature Communications,

106
0:06:21.526,000 --> 0:06:23,000
it was highlighted by Nature.com,

107
0:06:23.692,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and they created this animation.

108
0:06:26.192,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Music)

109
0:06:27.5,000 --> 0:06:29,000
[A laser pulse is fired]

110
0:06:30.388,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Music)

111
0:06:33.284,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Ramesh Raskar: We're going to fire those bullets of light,

112
0:06:36.175,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and they're going to hit this wall,

113
0:06:39.575,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and because of the packet of the photons,

114
0:06:42.23,000 --> 0:06:44,000
they will scatter in all the directions,

115
0:06:44.364,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and some of them will reach our hidden mannequin,

116
0:06:46.729,000 --> 0:06:49,000
which in turn will again scatter that light,

117
0:06:50.135,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and again in turn, the door will reflect some of that scattered light.

118
0:06:55.943,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera,

119
0:06:59.463,000 --> 0:07:,000
but most interestingly,

120
0:07:00.638,000 --> 0:07:03,000
they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot.

121
0:07:04.186,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Music)

122
0:07:09.043,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And because we have a camera that can run so fast --

123
0:07:11.58,000 --> 0:07:14,000
our femto-camera -- it has some unique abilities.

124
0:07:14.686,000 --> 0:07:16,000
It has very good time resolution,

125
0:07:17.528,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and it can look at the world at the speed of light.

126
0:07:21.374,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And this way, we know the distances, of course to the door,

127
0:07:24.655,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but also to the hidden objects,

128
0:07:26.456,000 --> 0:07:29,000
but we don't know which point corresponds to which distance.

129
0:07:29.637,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Music)

130
0:07:33.706,000 --> 0:07:36,000
By shining one laser, we can record one raw photo,

131
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
which, if you look on the screen, doesn't really make any sense.

132
0:07:40.208,000 --> 0:07:42,000
But then we will take a lot of such pictures,

133
0:07:42.352,000 --> 0:07:44,000
dozens of such pictures, put them together,

134
0:07:44.536,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light,

135
0:07:47.018,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and from that, can we see the hidden object?

136
0:07:50.493,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Can we see it in full 3D?

137
0:07:53.373,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So this is our reconstruction.

138
0:07:55.326,000 --> 0:08:,000
(Music)

139
0:08:00.48,000 --> 0:08:06,000
(Applause)

140
0:08:08.051,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Now, we have some ways to go

141
0:08:09.544,000 --> 0:08:12,000
before we take this outside the lab on the road,

142
0:08:12.703,000 --> 0:08:15,000
but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collisions

143
0:08:16.456,000 --> 0:08:17,000
with what's around the bend.

144
0:08:18.841,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions

145
0:08:22.952,000 --> 0:08:25,000
by looking at light reflected through open windows.

146
0:08:26.864,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Or we can build endoscopes that can see deep inside the body around occluders,

147
0:08:32.759,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and also for cardioscopes.

148
0:08:34.483,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But of course, because of tissue and blood,

149
0:08:36.873,000 --> 0:08:37,000
this is quite challenging,

150
0:08:38.152,000 --> 0:08:39,000
so this is really a call for scientists

151
0:08:40.111,000 --> 0:08:42,000
to start thinking about femto-photography

152
0:08:42.442,000 --> 0:08:43,000
as really a new imaging modality

153
0:08:44.347,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to solve the next generation of health-imaging problems.

154
0:08:48.342,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Now, like Doc Edgerton, a scientist himself,

155
0:08:52.223,000 --> 0:08:54,000
science became art --

156
0:08:54.55,000 --> 0:08:56,000
an art of ultra-fast photography.

157
0:08:58.14,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And I realized

158
0:08:59.315,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that all the gigabytes of data that we're collecting every time,

159
0:09:02.78,000 --> 0:09:04,000
are not just for scientific imaging.

160
0:09:05.225,000 --> 0:09:1,000
But we can also do a new form of computational photography,

161
0:09:10.788,000 --> 0:09:12,000
with time-lapse and color coding.

162
0:09:14.407,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And we look at those ripples.

163
0:09:15.9,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Remember:

164
0:09:17.082,000 --> 0:09:22,000
The time between each of those ripples is only a few trillionths of a second.

165
0:09:23.862,000 --> 0:09:25,000
But there's also something funny going on here.

166
0:09:26.093,000 --> 0:09:28,000
When you look at the ripples under the cap,

167
0:09:28.913,000 --> 0:09:3,000
the ripples are moving away from us.

168
0:09:32.111,000 --> 0:09:33,000
The ripples should be moving towards us.

169
0:09:34.049,000 --> 0:09:35,000
What's going on here?

170
0:09:35.445,000 --> 0:09:41,000
It turns out, because we're recording nearly at the speed of light,

171
0:09:42.259,000 --> 0:09:43,000
we have strange effects,

172
0:09:44.172,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and Einstein would have loved to see this picture.

173
0:09:47.457,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Laughter)

174
0:09:48.52,000 --> 0:09:51,000
The order at which events take place in the world

175
0:09:51.591,000 --> 0:09:54,000
appears in the camera sometimes in reversed order.

176
0:09:56.306,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So by applying the corresponding space and time warp,

177
0:09:59.525,000 --> 0:10:01,000
we can correct for this distortion.

178
0:10:03.866,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So whether it's for photography around corners,

179
0:10:08.239,000 --> 0:10:11,000
or creating the next generation of health imaging,

180
0:10:12.259,000 --> 0:10:14,000
or creating new visualizations,

181
0:10:15.175,000 --> 0:10:16,000
since our invention,

182
0:10:16.823,000 --> 0:10:21,000
we have open-sourced all the data and details on our website,

183
0:10:21.972,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and our hope is that the DIY, the creative and the research communities

184
0:10:28.949,000 --> 0:10:33,000
will show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels in cameras --

185
0:10:34.478,000 --> 0:10:35,000
(Laughter)

186
0:10:35.781,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging.

187
0:10:40.867,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It's about time.

188
0:10:42.597,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Thank you.

189
0:10:43.773,000 --> 0:10:49,000
(Applause)

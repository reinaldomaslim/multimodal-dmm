1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It's very, very difficult

2
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to speak at the end of a conference like this,

3
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:37,000
because everyone has spoken. Everything has been said.

4
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So I thought that what may be useful is to remind us

5
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:44,000
of some of the things that have gone on here,

6
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away,

7
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and take forward and work on.

8
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:53,000
That's what I'd like to try and do.

9
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:58,000
We came here saying we want to talk about "Africa: the Next Chapter."

10
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:,000
But we are talking about "Africa: the Next Chapter"

11
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:06,000
because we are looking at the old and the present chapter -- that we're looking at,

12
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and saying it's not such a good thing.

13
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The picture I showed you before, and this picture, of drought, death and disease

14
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:16,000
is what we usually see.

15
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
What we want to look at is "Africa: the Next Chapter,"

16
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and that's this: a healthy, smiling, beautiful African.

17
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And I think it's worth remembering what we've heard

18
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:29,000
through the conference right from the first day,

19
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
where I heard that all the important statistics have been given --

20
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:35,000
about where we are now,

21
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:38,000
about how the continent is doing much better.

22
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on.

23
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So I'm not going to spend too much time --

24
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:48,000
just to show you, refresh your memories

25
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that we are here for "Africa: the Next Chapter" because for the first time

26
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:54,000
there really is a platform to build on.

27
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We really do have it going right

28
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:,000
that the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen.

29
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:04,000
After decades of 2 percent, we are now at 5 percent,

30
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and it's going to -- projected -- 6 and 7 percent even.

31
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And inflation has come down.

32
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:14,000
External debt -- something that I can tell you a long story about

33
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:18,000
because I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent --

34
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:2,000
has come down dramatically.

35
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:23,000
You know, as you can see,

36
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
from almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion.

37
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Now this is a huge achievement.

38
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You know, we've built up reserves. Why is that important?

39
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
It's because it shows off our economies, shows off our currencies

40
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and gives a platform on which people can plan and build, including businesses.

41
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We've also seen some evidence that all this is making a difference

42
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:48,000
because private investment flows have increased.

43
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I want to remind you again --

44
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I know you saw these statistics before --

45
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:55,000
from almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion.

46
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
In 2005, remittances -- I just took one country, Nigeria

47
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:03,000
skyrocketing -- skyrocketing is too dramatic,

48
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:07,000
but increasing dramatically.

49
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And in many other countries this is happening.

50
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Why is this important? Because it shows confidence.

51
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:14,000
People are now confident to bring --

52
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:17,000
if your people in the diaspora bring their money back,

53
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:19,000
it shows other people that, look,

54
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:22,000
there is emerging confidence in your country.

55
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And instead of an outflow, you are now getting a net inflow.

56
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Now, why is all this important, to have to go really fast?

57
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It's important that we build this platform,

58
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that we have the president, Kikwete, and others of our leaders who are saying,

59
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
"Look, we must do something different."

60
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Because we are confronted with a challenge.

61
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:44,000
62 percent of our population is below the age of 24.

62
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:47,000
What does this mean?

63
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:5,000
This means that we have to focus on how our youth

64
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
are going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives.

65
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:55,000
You have to focus on how to create jobs,

66
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:58,000
make sure they don't fall into disease, and that they get an education.

67
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But most of all that they are productively engaged in life,

68
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and that they are creating the kind of productive environment

69
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in our countries that will make things happen.

70
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And to support this, I just recently --

71
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:12,000
one of the things I've done since leaving government

72
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:15,000
is to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria.

73
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Most of our countries don't even have any opinion research.

74
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:21,000
People don't have voice.

75
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:23,000
There is no way you can know what people want.

76
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:25,000
One of the things we asked them recently was what's their top issue.

77
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Like in every other country where this has been done,

78
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:32,000
jobs is the top issue.

79
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I want to leave this up here and come back to it.

80
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But before I get to this slide, I just wanted to run you through this.

81
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And to say that for me, the next stage of building this platform

82
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that now enables us to move forward --

83
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and we mustn't make light of it.

84
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It was only 5, 6, 7 years ago

85
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:58,000
we couldn't even talk about the next chapter, because we were in the old chapter.

86
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:,000
We were going nowhere.

87
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The economies were not growing.

88
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:07,000
We were having negative per capita growth.

89
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward

90
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:12,000
was not even there.

91
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So let's not forget that it's taken a lot to build this,

92
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
including all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to.

93
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Creating our own program to solve problems, like fighting corruption,

94
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:29,000
building institutions, stabilizing the micro economy.

95
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So now we have this platform we can build on.

96
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And it brings us to the debate that has been going on here:

97
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:43,000
aid versus private sector, aid versus trade, etc.

98
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things

99
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:5,000
is that it's been a simplistic debate.

100
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And that's not what the debate should be about.

101
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:58,000
That's engaging in the wrong debate.

102
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors,

103
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:05,000
the private sector and ordinary African people

104
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:08,000
taking charge of their own lives?

105
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:13,000
How do we combine all this?

106
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:15,000
To move our continent forward, to do the things that need doing

107
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that I talked about -- getting young people employed.

108
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Getting the creative juices flowing on this continent,

109
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:24,000
much of what you have seen here.

110
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So I'm afraid we've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate.

111
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:29,000
We need to bring it back to say,

112
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:32,000
what is the combination of all these factors

113
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that is going to yield what we want? (Applause)

114
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And I want to tell you something.

115
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:44,000
For me, the issue about aid --

116
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I don't think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side

117
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and feel bad about aid.

118
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Africa has been giving the other countries aid.

119
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Mo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that

120
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:01,000
he dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid.

121
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And I said, "Mo, you're right. We have -- no, but we've already been doing it!

122
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:1,000
The U.K. and the U.S. could not have been built today without Africa's aid."

123
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:18,000
(Applause)

124
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It is all the resources that were taken from Africa,

125
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:24,000
including human, that built these countries today!

126
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So when they try to give back, we shouldn't be on the defensive.

127
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:34,000
The issue is not that.

128
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:38,000
The issue is how are we using what has been given back.

129
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:41,000
How are we using it?

130
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Is it being directed effectively?

131
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I want to tell you a little story.

132
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Why I don't mind if we get aid, but we use it well.

133
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:,000
From 1967 to '70, Nigeria fought a war -- the Nigeria-Biafra war.

134
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And in the middle of that war, I was 14 years old.

135
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:07,000
We spent much of our time with my mother cooking.

136
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:1,000
For the army -- my father joined the army as a brigadier -- the Biafran army.

137
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:12,000
We were on the Biafran side.

138
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And we were down to eating one meal a day, running from place to place,

139
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:17,000
but wherever we could help we did.

140
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:23,000
At a certain point in time, in 1969, things were really bad.

141
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:27,000
We were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day.

142
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:29,000
People, children were dying of kwashiorkor.

143
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I'm sure some of you who are not so young

144
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:34,000
will remember those pictures.

145
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Well, I was in the middle of it.

146
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:39,000
In the midst of all this, my mother fell ill with a stomach ailment for two or three days.

147
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:42,000
We thought she was going to die.

148
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:44,000
My father was not there.

149
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:45,000
He was in the army.

150
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So I was the oldest person in the house.

151
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:53,000
My sister fell very ill with malaria.

152
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:59,000
She was three years old and I was 15.

153
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And she had such a high fever. We tried everything.

154
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:05,000
It didn't look like it was going to work.

155
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor, who was

156
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:11,000
looking at people and giving them meds.

157
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Now I put my sister on my back -- burning --

158
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and I walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back.

159
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It was really hot. I was very hungry.

160
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman.

161
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people.

162
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I walked 10 kilometers, putting one foot in front of the other.

163
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I got there and I saw huge crowds.

164
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Almost a thousand people were there, trying to break down the door.

165
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:42,000
She was doing this in a church. How was I going to get in?

166
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I had to crawl in between the legs of these people

167
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:49,000
with my sister strapped on my back,

168
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:51,000
find a way to a window.

169
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And while they were trying to break down the door,

170
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I climbed in through the window, and jumped in.

171
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:01,000
This woman told me it was in the nick of time.

172
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:05,000
By the time we jumped into that hall, she was barely moving.

173
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:09,000
She gave a shot of her chloroquine -- what I learned was the chloroquine then --

174
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:11,000
gave her some -- it must have been a re-hydration --

175
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and some other therapies, and put us in a corner.

176
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:21,000
In about two to three hours, she started to move.

177
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And then they toweled her down because she started sweating,

178
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:32,000
which was a good sign.

179
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And then my sister woke up.

180
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And about five or six hours later, she said we could go home.

181
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I strapped her on my back.

182
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I walked the 10 kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had.

183
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I was so happy -- (Applause) -- that my sister was alive!

184
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Today she's 41 years old, a mother of three,

185
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and she's a physician saving other lives.

186
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:,000
Why am I telling that? I'm telling you that because --

187
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:06,000
when it is you or your person involved --

188
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:09,000
you don't care where -- whether it's aid.

189
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:19,000
You don't care what it is! (Applause)

190
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:24,000
You just want the person to be alive!

191
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And now let me become less sentimental, and say that saving lives --

192
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:3,000
which some of the aid we get does on this continent --

193
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:33,000
when you save the life of anyone, a farmer, a teacher, a mother,

194
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
they are contributing productively into the economy.

195
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And as an economist, we can also look at that side of the story.

196
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:46,000
These are people who are productive agents in the economy.

197
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So if we save people from HIV/AIDS, if we save them from malaria,

198
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:53,000
it means they can form the base of production for our economy.

199
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And by the same token --

200
0:11:57,000 --> 0:11:59,000
as someone said yesterday -- if we don't and they die,

201
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:01,000
their children will become a burden on the economy.

202
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So even from an economic standpoint,

203
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:07,000
if we leave the social and the humanitarian,

204
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:1,000
we need to save lives now.

205
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:13,000
So that's one of the reasons, from a personal experience, that I say

206
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:17,000
let's channel these resources we get into something productive.

207
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:23,000
However, I will also tell you that I'm one of those

208
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:26,000
who doesn't believe that this is the sole answer.

209
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
That's why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated.

210
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:34,000
You know, we have to use it well.

211
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:39,000
What has happened in Europe?

212
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Do you all know that Spain -- part of the EU --

213
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:47,000
got 10 billion dollars in aid from the rest of the EU?

214
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Resources that were transferred to them --

215
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and were the Spanish ashamed of this? No!

216
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:56,000
The EU transferred 10 billion. Where did they use it?

217
0:12:56,000 --> 0:13:,000
Have you been to southern Spain lately? There are roads everywhere.

218
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Infrastructure everywhere.

219
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:06,000
It is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain

220
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:08,000
has developed into a services economy.

221
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Did you know that Ireland got 3 billion dollars in aid?

222
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Ireland is one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union today.

223
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:18,000
For which many people, even from other parts of the world,

224
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:23,000
are going there to find jobs.

225
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:26,000
What did they do with the 3 billion dollars in aid?

226
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
They used it to build an information superhighway,

227
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:32,000
gain infrastructure that

228
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
enables them to participate in the

229
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:37,000
information technology revolution,

230
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and to create jobs in their economy.

231
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:42,000
They didn't say, "No, you know, we're not going to take this."

232
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Today, the European Union is busy transferring aid.

233
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:47,000
My frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain --

234
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:51,000
which is roads, highways, other things that they can build --

235
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:53,000
I say then, why do they refuse to use the same aid

236
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:55,000
to build the same infrastructure in our countries? (Applause)

237
0:13:55,000 --> 0:14:04,000
When we ask them and tell them what we need,

238
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:08,000
one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now.

239
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Now we talk about the World Bank, IMF, and accountability, all that

240
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and the EU.

241
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:18,000
We also have private citizens now who have a lot of money --

242
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:2,000
some of them in this audience, with private foundations.

243
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And one day, these foundations have so much money,

244
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:25,000
they will overtake the official aid that is being given.

245
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
But I fear -- and I'm very grateful to all of them

246
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:33,000
for what they are trying to do on the continent --

247
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
but I'm also worried. I wake up with a gnawing in my belly

248
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:43,000
because I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent.

249
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And they're also going from country to country,

250
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and many times trying to find what to do.

251
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:55,000
But I'm not really sure that their assistance

252
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:59,000
is also being channeled in the right way.

253
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And many of them are not really familiar with the continent.

254
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:03,000
They are just discovering.

255
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And many times I don't see Africans working with them.

256
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:1,000
They are just going alone! (Applause)

257
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And many times I get the impression that they are not really even interested

258
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:16,000
in hearing from Africans who might know.

259
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
They want to visit us,

260
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:21,000
see what's happening on the ground and make a decision.

261
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And now I'm maybe being harsh.

262
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:25,000
But I worry because this money is so important.

263
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Now, who are they accountable to?

264
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Are we on their boards when they make decisions

265
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
about where to channel money? Are we there?

266
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Will we make the same mistake that we made before?

267
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Have our presidents and our leaders -- everyone is talking about --

268
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:43,000
have they ever called these people together and said,

269
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:46,000
"Look, your foundation and your foundation --

270
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:48,000
you have so much money, we are grateful.

271
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Let's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled

272
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and where this aid should go."

273
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Have we done that? The answer is no.

274
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:02,000
And each one is making their own individual effort.

275
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And then 10 years from now, billions will again have gone into Africa,

276
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and we would still have the same problems.

277
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:12,000
This is what gives us the hopeless image.

278
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:16,000
Our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money,

279
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
"Sit down."

280
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And we don't do it because there are so many of us. We don't coordinate.

281
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:25,000
We've not called the Bill Gates, and the Soros,

282
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and everybody else who is helping and say,

283
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:34,000
"Sit down. Let's have a conference with you.

284
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:37,000
As a continent, here are our priorities.

285
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Here is where we want you to channel this money."

286
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Each one should not be an entrepreneur

287
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:46,000
going out and finding what is best.

288
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:5,000
We're not trying to stop them at all! But to help them help us better.

289
0:16:5,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this.

290
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Ten years from now we will have the same story,

291
0:16:55,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and we will be repeating the same things.

292
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:05,000
So our problem right now is, how can we leverage

293
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:1,000
all this good will that is coming towards our way?

294
0:17:11,000 --> 0:17:15,000
How can we get government to combine properly

295
0:17:15,000 --> 0:17:18,000
with these private foundations, with the international organizations,

296
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and with our private sector.

297
0:17:21,000 --> 0:17:24,000
I firmly believe in that private sector thing too.

298
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:26,000
But it cannot do it alone.

299
0:17:27,000 --> 0:17:29,000
So there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work.

300
0:17:3,000 --> 0:17:33,000
They said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas.

301
0:17:33,000 --> 0:17:38,000
So why don't we think of using some of this aid?

302
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:4,000
Well, why don't we first say to those helping us out,

303
0:17:41,000 --> 0:17:43,000
"Don't be shy about infrastructure.

304
0:17:43,000 --> 0:17:47,000
That health that you're working on cannot be sustainable without infrastructure.

305
0:17:5,000 --> 0:17:55,000
That education will work better

306
0:17:55,000 --> 0:17:58,000
if we've got electricity and railroads, and so on.

307
0:17:58,000 --> 0:18:01,000
That agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market.

308
0:18:01,000 --> 0:18:03,000
Don't be shy of it.

309
0:18:06,000 --> 0:18:09,000
Invest some of your resources in that, too."

310
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:14,000
And then we can see that this is one combination

311
0:18:14,000 --> 0:18:16,000
of private, international, multilateral money,

312
0:18:18,000 --> 0:18:21,000
private sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership,

313
0:18:21,000 --> 0:18:26,000
so that aid can be a facilitator.

314
0:18:26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
That is all aid can be.

315
0:18:29,000 --> 0:18:31,000
Aid cannot solve our problems, I'm firmly convinced about that.

316
0:18:31,000 --> 0:18:35,000
But it can be catalytic. And if we fail to use it as catalytic,

317
0:18:35,000 --> 0:18:39,000
we would have failed.

318
0:18:4,000 --> 0:18:42,000
One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now --

319
0:18:43,000 --> 0:18:48,000
one of the reasons is not only just that, you know, these people are stupid

320
0:18:48,000 --> 0:18:5,000
and China is coming to take resources.

321
0:18:51,000 --> 0:18:53,000
It's because there's a little more leverage in terms of the Chinese.

322
0:18:57,000 --> 0:19:,000
If you tell them, "We need a road here,"

323
0:19:02,000 --> 0:19:04,000
they will help you build it.

324
0:19:04,000 --> 0:19:05,000
They don't shy away from infrastructure.

325
0:19:05,000 --> 0:19:07,000
In fact, the Chinese minister of finance said to me,

326
0:19:07,000 --> 0:19:09,000
when I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria.

327
0:19:09,000 --> 0:19:12,000
He said, "There are two things you need only.

328
0:19:12,000 --> 0:19:15,000
Infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.

329
0:19:15,000 --> 0:19:18,000
You are undisciplined." (Applause)

330
0:19:24,000 --> 0:19:27,000
And I repeat it for the continent.

331
0:19:28,000 --> 0:19:29,000
It's the same. We need infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.

332
0:19:29,000 --> 0:19:32,000
So we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that.

333
0:19:32,000 --> 0:19:35,000
Now I realize -- I'm not saying -- health and education --

334
0:19:36,000 --> 0:19:39,000
no, you can also provide that as well.

335
0:19:39,000 --> 0:19:42,000
But I'm saying it's not either or.

336
0:19:42,000 --> 0:19:43,000
Let's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership.

337
0:19:44,000 --> 0:19:46,000
One idea.

338
0:19:47,000 --> 0:19:5,000
Second thing, for the private sector,

339
0:19:5,000 --> 0:19:54,000
people are afraid to take risks on the continent.

340
0:19:54,000 --> 0:19:56,000
Why can't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms,

341
0:19:56,000 --> 0:20:,000
to enable people to take risk?

342
0:20:,000 --> 0:20:01,000
(Applause)

343
0:20:01,000 --> 0:20:07,000
And finally, because they are both standing at my -- I'm out of time.

344
0:20:07,000 --> 0:20:1,000
Am I out of time?

345
0:20:1,000 --> 0:20:13,000
OK, so let me not forget my punchline.

346
0:20:13,000 --> 0:20:16,000
One of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is

347
0:20:16,000 --> 0:20:25,000
to support women, to create jobs. (Applause)

348
0:20:25,000 --> 0:20:27,000
A lot has been said here about women, I don't need to repeat it.

349
0:20:27,000 --> 0:20:29,000
But there are people -- women -- creating jobs.

350
0:20:3,000 --> 0:20:32,000
And we know, studies have shown

351
0:20:32,000 --> 0:20:35,000
that when you put resources in the hand of the woman --

352
0:20:35,000 --> 0:20:37,000
in fact, there's an econometric study,

353
0:20:37,000 --> 0:20:4,000
the World Bank Review, done in 2000, showing that

354
0:20:4,000 --> 0:20:43,000
transfers into the hands of women result

355
0:20:43,000 --> 0:20:46,000
in healthier children, more for the household, more for the economy and all that.

356
0:20:48,000 --> 0:20:5,000
So I'm saying that one of the takeaways from here --

357
0:20:51,000 --> 0:20:52,000
I'm not saying the men are not important --

358
0:20:52,000 --> 0:20:55,000
obviously, if you leave the husbands out, what will they do?

359
0:20:55,000 --> 0:20:57,000
They'll come back home and get disgruntled,

360
0:20:57,000 --> 0:21:,000
and it will result in difficulties we don't want.

361
0:21:01,000 --> 0:21:03,000
We don't want men beating their wives

362
0:21:03,000 --> 0:21:05,000
because they don't have a job, and so on.

363
0:21:06,000 --> 0:21:09,000
But at the margin, we also -- I want to push this,

364
0:21:09,000 --> 0:21:12,000
because the reason is the men automatically --

365
0:21:13,000 --> 0:21:16,000
they get -- not automatically, but they tend to get more support.

366
0:21:18,000 --> 0:21:21,000
But I want you to realize that resources

367
0:21:21,000 --> 0:21:25,000
in the hands of African women is a powerful tool.

368
0:21:25,000 --> 0:21:29,000
There are people creating jobs.

369
0:21:29,000 --> 0:21:31,000
Beatrice Gakuba has created 200 jobs from her flower business in Rwanda.

370
0:21:31,000 --> 0:21:35,000
We have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria, with the chair company.

371
0:21:36,000 --> 0:21:37,000
She wants to expand.

372
0:21:38,000 --> 0:21:4,000
She needs another 20 million.

373
0:21:4,000 --> 0:21:43,000
She will create another 100, 200 more jobs.

374
0:21:44,000 --> 0:21:48,000
So take away from here is how are you going to put together

375
0:21:48,000 --> 0:21:5,000
the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle

376
0:21:5,000 --> 0:21:54,000
who are ready --

377
0:21:54,000 --> 0:21:56,000
business people who want to expand and create more jobs.

378
0:21:57,000 --> 0:22:01,000
And lastly, what are you going to do

379
0:22:02,000 --> 0:22:07,000
to be part of this partnership of aid, government, private sector

380
0:22:07,000 --> 0:22:1,000
and the African as an individual?

381
0:22:1,000 --> 0:22:19,000
Thank you. (Applause)

1
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Music)

2
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Applause)

3
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I'm Jon M. Chu. And I'm not a dancer,

4
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I'm not a choreographer -- I'm actually a filmmaker, a storyteller.

5
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I directed a movie two years ago

6
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
called "Step Up 2: The Streets."

7
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Anybody? Anybody? Yeah!

8
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
During that movie I got to meet a ton of hip-hop dancers --

9
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
amazing, the best in the world --

10
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and they brought me into a society, the sort of underground

11
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
street culture that blew my mind.

12
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I mean, this is literally human beings

13
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
with super-human strength and abilities.

14
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
They could fly in the air. They could bend their elbow all the way back.

15
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
They could spin on their heads for 80 times in a row.

16
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I'd never seen anything like that.

17
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
When I was growing up, my heroes were people like

18
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Michael Jackson.

19
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I grew up in a musical family.

20
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
(Laughter)

21
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And those guys, those were like, ultimate heroes.

22
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Being a shy, little, skinny Asian kid growing up in the Silicon Valley

23
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
with low self-esteem, those guys made me believe in something bigger.

24
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Those guys made me want to, like, "I'm going to do that

25
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
moonwalk at that bar mitzvah tonight for that girl."

26
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Applause)

27
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And it seems like those dance heroes have disappeared,

28
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
sort of relegated to the background of pop stars and music videos.

29
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But after seeing what I've seen,

30
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the truth is, they have not disappeared at all.

31
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
They're here, getting better and better every day.

32
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And dance has progressed.

33
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It is insane what dance is right now.

34
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Dance has never had a better friend than technology.

35
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Online videos and social networking ...

36
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
dancers have created a whole global laboratory online

37
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
for dance, where kids in Japan are taking moves

38
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
from a YouTube video created in Detroit,

39
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
building on it within days and releasing a new video,

40
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
while teenagers in California are taking the Japanese video and remixing it

41
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
with a Philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself.

42
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And this is happening every day.

43
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages,

44
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
with cheap webcams,

45
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow.

46
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Our Fred Astaires, our Gene Kellys

47
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
our Michael Jacksons are right at our fingertips,

48
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and may not have that opportunity, except for us.

49
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So, we created the LXD,

50
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
sort of a -- the Legion of Extraordinary Dancers,

51
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
a justice league of dancers that believe

52
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that dance can have a transformative effect on the world.

53
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
A living, breathing comic book series,

54
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
but unlike Spiderman and Iron Man,

55
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
these guys can actually do it.

56
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And we're going to show you some today. So, let me introduce to you,

57
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
some of our heroes right now.

58
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We got Madd Chadd,

59
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Lil' C, Kid David and J Smooth.

60
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Please be excited, have fun, yell, scream.

61
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Ladies and gentlemen: The LXD.

62
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Applause)

63
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
(Video): Madd Chadd: When people first see me,

64
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I get a lot of different reactions actually.

65
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it,

66
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but sometimes they get a little freaked out.

67
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And, I don't know, I kind of get a kick out of that a little bit.

68
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
(Music)

69
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Applause)

70
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
J Smooth: When I'm in the zone -- I'm dancing and free styling it --

71
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I actually visually kind of picture

72
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
lines, and moving them.

73
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I think of like, Transformers,

74
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
like how panels open and then they fold,

75
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
they fold in, and then you close that panel.

76
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And then another thing opens,

77
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
you close that.

78
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Music)

79
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Applause)

80
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Kid David: It's kind of like, honestly a lot of times

81
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I don't really know what's going on

82
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
when I'm dancing.

83
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Because at that point it's just really like, it's my body and the music.

84
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
It's not really a conscious decision,

85
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
"I'm going to do this next, I'm going to do this."

86
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
It's kind of like this other level

87
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
where you can't make choices anymore,

88
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and it's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music.

89
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I got my name just because I was so young.

90
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I was young when I started. I was younger than a lot of the people I was dancing with.

91
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So, it was always like, they called me Kid David, because I was the kid.

92
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
(Music)

93
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
(Applause)

94
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
L'il C: I tell them to create a ball,

95
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and then you just use that ball of energy.

96
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And instead of throwing it out, people would think

97
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that's a krump move, that's a krump move.

98
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
That's not a krump move. You're going to throw it out,

99
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
you throw it out, and you hold it.

100
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And you let it go, and then right when you see the tail,

101
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
you grab it by the tail, then you bring it back in.

102
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And you just got this piece of energy

103
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and you just, you're manipulating it.

104
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
You know, you create power, then you tame it.

105
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Music)

106
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
(Applause)

107
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Music)

108
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
(Applause)

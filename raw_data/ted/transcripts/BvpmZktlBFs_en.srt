1
0:00:12.942,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Last year ...

2
0:00:14.657,000 --> 0:00:15,000
was hell.

3
0:00:15.884,000 --> 0:00:16,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:20.391,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It was my first time eating Nigerian "jollof."

5
0:00:23.967,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:26.436,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Actually, in all seriousness,

7
0:00:29.319,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I was going through a lot of personal turmoil.

8
0:00:33.055,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Faced with enormous stress,

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I suffered an anxiety attack.

10
0:00:38.362,000 --> 0:00:4,000
On some days, I could do no work.

11
0:00:42.156,000 --> 0:00:43,000
On other days,

12
0:00:44.076,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I just wanted to lay in my bed and cry.

13
0:00:48.478,000 --> 0:00:53,000
My doctor asked if I'd like to speak with a mental health professional

14
0:00:53.751,000 --> 0:00:55,000
about my stress and anxiety.

15
0:00:56.589,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Mental health?

16
0:00:58.792,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I clammed up and violently shook my head in protest.

17
0:01:05.065,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I felt a profound sense of a shame.

18
0:01:10.233,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I felt the weight of stigma.

19
0:01:14.959,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I have a loving, supportive family

20
0:01:17.342,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and incredibly loyal friends,

21
0:01:19.673,000 --> 0:01:23,000
yet I could not entertain the idea of speaking to anyone

22
0:01:24.266,000 --> 0:01:26,000
about my feeling of pain.

23
0:01:27.824,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I felt suffocated by the rigid architecture

24
0:01:32.315,000 --> 0:01:34,000
of our African masculinity.

25
0:01:35.585,000 --> 0:01:37,000
"People have real problems, Sangu.

26
0:01:37.724,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Get over yourself!"

27
0:01:40.776,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The first time I heard "mental health,"

28
0:01:43.7,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I was a boarding school student fresh off the boat from Ghana,

29
0:01:47.687,000 --> 0:01:48,000
at the Peddie School in New Jersey.

30
0:01:50.887,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I had just gone through the brutal experience

31
0:01:54.317,000 --> 0:01:56,000
of losing seven loved ones in the same month.

32
0:01:58.389,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The school nurse,

33
0:01:59.869,000 --> 0:02:03,000
concerned about what I'd gone through -- God bless her soul --

34
0:02:03.957,000 --> 0:02:04,000
she inquired about my mental health.

35
0:02:07.246,000 --> 0:02:08,000
"Is she mental?" I thought.

36
0:02:10.034,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Does she not know I'm an African man?

37
0:02:12.502,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:13.54,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Like Okonkwo in "Things Fall Apart,"

39
0:02:15.435,000 --> 0:02:19,000
we African men neither process nor express our emotions.

40
0:02:20.791,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We deal with our problems.

41
0:02:22.506,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Applause)

42
0:02:25.001,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We deal with our problems.

43
0:02:27.024,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I called my brother and laughed about "Oyibo" people -- white people --

44
0:02:31.819,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and their strange diseases --

45
0:02:33.7,000 --> 0:02:36,000
depression, ADD and those "weird things."

46
0:02:38.32,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Growing up in West Africa,

47
0:02:40.335,000 --> 0:02:44,000
when people used the term "mental," what came to mind was a madman

48
0:02:44.74,000 --> 0:02:46,000
with dirty, dread-locked hair,

49
0:02:47.007,000 --> 0:02:49,000
bumbling around half-naked on the streets.

50
0:02:50.904,000 --> 0:02:51,000
We all know this man.

51
0:02:52.748,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Our parents warned us about him.

52
0:02:55.64,000 --> 0:02:56,000
"Mommy, mommy, why is he mad?"

53
0:02:57.209,000 --> 0:02:58,000
"Drugs!

54
0:02:58.445,000 --> 0:03:,000
If you even look at drugs, you end up like him."

55
0:03:00.858,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Laughter)

56
0:03:02.8,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Come down with pneumonia,

57
0:03:04.889,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and your mother will rush you to the nearest hospital

58
0:03:07.445,000 --> 0:03:08,000
for medical treatment.

59
0:03:09.91,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But dare to declare depression,

60
0:03:13.278,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and your local pastor will be driving out demons

61
0:03:16.704,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and blaming witches in your village.

62
0:03:19.118,000 --> 0:03:21,000
According to the World Health Organization,

63
0:03:22.042,000 --> 0:03:25,000
mental health is about being able to cope

64
0:03:25.124,000 --> 0:03:26,000
with the normal stressors of life;

65
0:03:27.741,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to work productively and fruitfully;

66
0:03:31.208,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and to be able to make a contribution to your community.

67
0:03:35.321,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Mental health includes our emotional, psychological and social well-being.

68
0:03:42.676,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Globally, 75 percent of all mental illness cases

69
0:03:47.46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
can be found in low-income countries.

70
0:03:50.118,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Yet most African governments

71
0:03:51.974,000 --> 0:03:55,000
invest less than one percent of their health care budget

72
0:03:56.205,000 --> 0:03:57,000
in mental health.

73
0:03:58.501,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Even worse,

74
0:03:59.705,000 --> 0:04:03,000
we have a severe shortage of psychiatrists in Africa.

75
0:04:04.656,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Nigeria, for example, is estimated to have 200 --

76
0:04:09.632,000 --> 0:04:12,000
in a country of almost 200 million.

77
0:04:14.242,000 --> 0:04:15,000
In all of Africa,

78
0:04:15.735,000 --> 0:04:18,000
90 percent of our people lack access to treatment.

79
0:04:20.501,000 --> 0:04:21,000
As a result,

80
0:04:22.278,000 --> 0:04:25,000
we suffer in solitude,

81
0:04:25.306,000 --> 0:04:27,000
silenced by stigma.

82
0:04:29.318,000 --> 0:04:33,000
We as Africans often respond to mental health with distance,

83
0:04:34.664,000 --> 0:04:35,000
ignorance,

84
0:04:36.355,000 --> 0:04:37,000
guilt,

85
0:04:37.954,000 --> 0:04:38,000
fear

86
0:04:39.754,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and anger.

87
0:04:42.129,000 --> 0:04:46,000
In a study conducted by Arboleda-Flórez,

88
0:04:46.83,000 --> 0:04:49,000
directly asking, "What is the cause of mental illness?"

89
0:04:51.487,000 --> 0:04:56,000
34 percent of Nigerian respondents cited drug misuse;

90
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
19 percent said divine wrath and the will of God --

91
0:05:03.368,000 --> 0:05:04,000
(Laughter)

92
0:05:05.27,000 --> 0:05:06,000
12 percent,

93
0:05:07.95,000 --> 0:05:09,000
witchcraft and spiritual possession.

94
0:05:11.616,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But few cited other known causes of mental illness,

95
0:05:16.2,000 --> 0:05:17,000
like genetics,

96
0:05:17.87,000 --> 0:05:18,000
socioeconomic status,

97
0:05:19.83,000 --> 0:05:2,000
war,

98
0:05:21.449,000 --> 0:05:22,000
conflict

99
0:05:22.886,000 --> 0:05:23,000
or the loss of a loved one.

100
0:05:25.829,000 --> 0:05:27,000
The stigmatization against mental illness

101
0:05:28.74,000 --> 0:05:32,000
often results in the ostracizing and demonizing of sufferers.

102
0:05:34.255,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Photojournalist Robin Hammond has documented some of these abuses ...

103
0:05:38.275,000 --> 0:05:39,000
in Uganda,

104
0:05:40.665,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in Somalia,

105
0:05:43.089,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and here in Nigeria.

106
0:05:47.374,000 --> 0:05:48,000
For me,

107
0:05:49.877,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the stigma is personal.

108
0:05:53.942,000 --> 0:05:54,000
In 2009,

109
0:05:56.616,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I received a frantic call in the middle of the night.

110
0:06:01.179,000 --> 0:06:03,000
My best friend in the world --

111
0:06:03.551,000 --> 0:06:08,000
a brilliant, philosophical, charming, hip young man --

112
0:06:08.714,000 --> 0:06:1,000
was diagnosed with schizophrenia.

113
0:06:12.424,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I witnessed some of the friends we'd grown up with recoil.

114
0:06:19.136,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I heard the snickers.

115
0:06:21.448,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I heard the whispers.

116
0:06:24.006,000 --> 0:06:26,000
"Did you hear he has gone mad?"

117
0:06:27.095,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Kru English) "He has gone crazy!"

118
0:06:29.669,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Derogatory, demeaning commentary about his condition --

119
0:06:34.013,000 --> 0:06:37,000
words we would never say about someone with cancer

120
0:06:38.014,000 --> 0:06:39,000
or someone with malaria.

121
0:06:40.484,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Somehow, when it comes to mental illness,

122
0:06:44.187,000 --> 0:06:47,000
our ignorance eviscerates all empathy.

123
0:06:48.539,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I stood by his side as his community isolated him,

124
0:06:53.98,000 --> 0:06:55,000
but our love never wavered.

125
0:06:57.668,000 --> 0:07:,000
Tacitly, I became passionate about mental health.

126
0:07:01.694,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Inspired by his plight,

127
0:07:04.35,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I helped found the mental health special interest alumni group

128
0:07:07.697,000 --> 0:07:08,000
at my college.

129
0:07:09.376,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And during my tenure as a resident tutor in graduate school,

130
0:07:12.777,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I supported many undergraduates with their mental health challenges.

131
0:07:17.271,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I saw African students struggle

132
0:07:19.81,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and unable to speak to anyone.

133
0:07:22.566,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Even with this knowledge and with their stories in tow,

134
0:07:26.586,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I, in turn, struggled,

135
0:07:28.596,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and could not speak to anyone when I faced my own anxiety,

136
0:07:33.193,000 --> 0:07:36,000
so deep is our fear of being the madman.

137
0:07:39.735,000 --> 0:07:4,000
All of us --

138
0:07:41.698,000 --> 0:07:43,000
but we Africans especially --

139
0:07:44.775,000 --> 0:07:49,000
need to realize that our mental struggles do not detract from our virility,

140
0:07:50.706,000 --> 0:07:52,000
nor does our trauma taint our strength.

141
0:07:54.756,000 --> 0:07:58,000
We need to see mental health as important as physical health.

142
0:08:00.403,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We need to stop suffering in silence.

143
0:08:05.939,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We must stop stigmatizing disease

144
0:08:09.421,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and traumatizing the afflicted.

145
0:08:13.399,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Talk to your friends.

146
0:08:15.834,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Talk to your loved ones.

147
0:08:18.394,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Talk to health professionals.

148
0:08:21.437,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Be vulnerable.

149
0:08:23.615,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Do so with the confidence

150
0:08:26.335,000 --> 0:08:28,000
that you are not alone.

151
0:08:30.011,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Speak up if you're struggling.

152
0:08:34.414,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Being honest about how we feel

153
0:08:37.965,000 --> 0:08:38,000
does not make us weak;

154
0:08:40.629,000 --> 0:08:41,000
it makes us human.

155
0:08:43.499,000 --> 0:08:47,000
It is time to end the stigma associated with mental illness.

156
0:08:48.93,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So the next time your hear "mental,"

157
0:08:53.228,000 --> 0:08:54,000
do not just think of the madman.

158
0:08:56.163,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Think of me.

159
0:08:57.796,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Applause)

160
0:08:59.744,000 --> 0:09:,000
Thank you.

161
0:09:01.051,000 --> 0:09:04,000
(Applause)

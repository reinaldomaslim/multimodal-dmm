1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
First of all, I'm a geek.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm an organic food-eating,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
carbon footprint-minimizing, robotic surgery geek.

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And I really want to build green,

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but I'm very suspicious

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
of all of these well-meaning articles,

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
people long on moral authority

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and short on data,

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
telling me how to do these kinds of things.

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And so I have to figure this out for myself.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
For example: Is this evil?

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I have dropped a blob of organic yogurt

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
from happy self-actualized local cows

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
on my counter top,

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But can I use a paper towel? (Laughter)

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The answer to this can be found in embodied energy.

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
This is the amount of energy that goes into

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
any paper towel or embodied water,

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and every time I use a paper towel,

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I am using this much

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
virtual energy and water.

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Wipe it up, throw it away.

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Now, if I compare that to a cotton towel

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that I can use a thousand times,

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I don't have a whole lot of embodied energy

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
until I wash that yogurty towel.

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
This is now operating energy.

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So if I throw my towel in the washing machine,

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I've now put energy and water

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
back into that towel ...

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
unless I use a front-loading, high-efficiency washing machine, (Laughter)

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and then it looks a little bit better.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But what about a recycled paper towel

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that comes in those little half sheets?

36
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Well, now a paper towel looks better.

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Screw the paper towels. Let's go to a sponge.

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I wipe it up with a sponge, and I put it under the running water,

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and I have a lot less energy and a lot more water.

40
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Unless you're like me and you leave the handle

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in the position of hot even when you turn it on,

42
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and then you start to use more energy.

43
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Or worse, you let it run until it's warm

44
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to rinse out your towel.

45
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And now all bets are off.

46
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So what this says is that

48
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
sometimes the things that you least expect --

49
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
the position in which you put the handle --

50
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
have a bigger effect than any of those other things

51
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that you were trying to optimize.

52
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Now imagine someone as twisted as me

53
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
trying to build a house.

54
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
That's what my husband and I are doing right now.

56
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And so, we wanted to know, how green could we be?

57
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And there's a thousand and one articles out there

58
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
telling us how to make all these green trade-offs.

59
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And they are just as suspect

60
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges

61
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and missing the elephant in the living room.

62
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Now, the average house

63
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
has about 300 megawatt hours

64
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
of embodied energy in it;

65
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
this is the energy it takes to make it --

66
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
millions and millions of paper towels.

67
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We wanted to know how much better we could do.

68
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And so, like many people,

69
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
we start with a house on a lot,

70
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and I'm going to show you a typical construction on the top

71
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and what we're doing on the bottom.

72
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So first, we demolish it.

73
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
It takes some energy, but if you deconstruct it --

74
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
you take it all apart, you use the bits --

75
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
you can get some of that energy back.

76
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
We then dug a big hole

77
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to put in a rainwater catchment tank

78
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to take our yard water independent.

79
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And then we poured a big foundation

80
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
for passive solar.

81
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Now, you can reduce the embodied energy

82
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
by about 25 percent

83
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
by using high fly ash concrete.

84
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We then put in framing.

85
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And so this is framing -- lumber,

86
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
composite materials --

87
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and it's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that,

88
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
but it can be a sustainable resource

89
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
if you use FSC-certified lumber.

90
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We then go on to

91
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
the first thing that was very surprising.

92
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
If we put aluminum windows in this house,

93
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
we would double the energy use right there.

94
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Now, PVC is a little bit better,

95
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but still not as good as the wood that we chose.

96
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We then put in plumbing,

97
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
electrical and HVAC,

98
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and insulate.

99
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Now, spray foam is an excellent insulator -- it fills in all the cracks --

100
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
but it is pretty high embodied energy,

101
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and, sprayed-in cellulose or blue jeans

102
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
is a much lower energy alternative to that.

103
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
We also used straw bale

104
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
infill for our library,

105
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
which has zero embodied energy.

106
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
When it comes time to sheetrock,

107
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
if you use EcoRock it's about a quarter

108
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock.

109
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And then you get to the finishes,

110
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the subject of all of those "go green" articles,

111
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and on the scale of a house

112
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
they almost make no difference at all.

113
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And yet, all the press is focused on that.

114
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Except for flooring.

115
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
If you put carpeting in your house,

116
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house,

117
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
unless you use concrete or wood

118
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
for a much lower embodied energy.

119
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So now we add in the final construction energy, we add it all up,

120
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and we've built a house for less than half

121
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this.

122
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But before we pat ourselves

123
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
too much on the back,

124
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
we have poured 151 megawatt hours

125
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
of energy into constructing this house

126
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
when there was a house there before.

127
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And so the question is:

128
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
How could we make that back?

129
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And so if I run my new energy-efficient house forward,

130
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
compared with the old, non-energy-efficient house,

131
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
we make it back in about six years.

132
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Now, I probably would have upgraded the old house

133
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to be more energy-efficient,

134
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and in that case,

135
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
it would take me more about 20 years to break even.

136
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Now, if I hadn't paid attention to embodied energy,

137
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
it would have taken us

138
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
over 50 years to break even

139
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
compared to the upgraded house.

140
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So what does this mean?

141
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
On the scale of my portion of the house,

142
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
this is equivalent to about

143
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
as much as I drive in a year,

144
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
it's about five times as much

145
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
as if I went entirely vegetarian.

146
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
But my elephant in the living room flies.

147
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Clearly, I need to walk home from TED.

148
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But all the calculations

149
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
for embodied energy are on the blog.

150
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And, remember, it's sometimes the things that you are not expecting

151
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to be the biggest changes that are.

152
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Thank you. (Applause)

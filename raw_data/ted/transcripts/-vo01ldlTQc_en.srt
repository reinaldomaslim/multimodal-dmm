1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So I'm going to tell you a little bit

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
about reimagining food.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I've been interested in food for a long time.

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I taught myself to cook

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
with a bunch of big books like this.

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I went to chef school in France.

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And there is a way

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the world both envisions food,

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
the way the world writes about food and learns about food.

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And it's largely what you would find in these books.

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And it's a wonderful thing.

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But there's some things that have been going on

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
since this idea of food was established.

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
In the last 20 years,

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
people have realized that science

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
has a tremendous amount to do with food.

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
In fact, understanding why cooking works

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
requires knowing the science of cooking --

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
some of the chemistry, some of the physics and so forth.

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But that's not in any of those books.

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
There's also a tremendous number of techniques

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that chefs have developed,

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
some about new aesthetics, new approaches to food.

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
There's a chef in Spain named Ferran Adria.

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
He's developed a very avant-garde cuisine.

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
A guy in England called Heston Blumenthal,

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
he's developed his avant-garde cuisine.

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
None of the techniques that these people have developed

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
over the course of the last 20 years

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
is in any of those books.

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
None of them are taught in cooking schools.

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
In order to learn them, you have to go work in those restaurants.

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And finally,

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
there's the old way of viewing food

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
is the old way.

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And so a few years ago -- fours years ago, actually --

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I set out to say, is there a way

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
we can communicate science and technique and wonder?

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Is there a way we can show people food

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
in a way they have not seen it before?

41
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So we tried, and I'll show you what we came up with.

42
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
This is a picture called a cutaway.

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
This is actually the first picture I took in the book.

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The idea here is to explain what happens

45
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
when you steam broccoli.

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And this magic view allows you to see

47
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
all of what's happening

48
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
while the broccoli steams.

49
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Then each of the different little pieces around it

50
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
explain some fact.

51
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And the hope was two-fold.

52
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
One is you can actually explain what happens when you steam broccoli.

53
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people

54
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
into stuff that was a little more technical,

55
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
maybe a little bit more scientific, maybe a little bit more chef-y

56
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
than they otherwise would have.

57
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Because with that beautiful photo,

58
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
maybe I can also package this little box here

59
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that talks about how steaming and boiling

60
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
actually take different amounts of time.

61
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Steaming ought to be faster.

62
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It turns out it isn't because of something called film condensation,

63
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and this explains that.

64
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Well, that first cutaway picture worked,

65
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
so we said, "Okay, let's do some more."

66
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So here's another one.

67
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We discovered why woks are the shape they are.

68
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
This shaped wok doesn't work very well;

69
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
this caught fire three times.

70
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
But we had a philosophy,

71
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second.

72
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And one of our canning cutaways.

74
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Once you start cutting things in half, you kind of get carried away,

75
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan.

76
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And each of these text blocks

77
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
explains a key thing that's going on.

78
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
In this case, boiling water canning

79
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
is for canning things that are already pretty acidic.

80
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
You don't have to heat them up as hot

81
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
as you would something you do pressure canning

82
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
because bacterial spores can't grow in the acid.

83
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So this is great for pickled vegetables,

84
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
which is what we're canning here.

85
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Here's our hamburger cutaway.

86
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
One of our philosophies in the book

87
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
is that no dish

88
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
is really intrinsically any better than any other dish.

89
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So you can lavish

90
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
all the same care, all the same technique,

91
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
on a hamburger

92
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
as you would on some much more fancy dish.

93
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And if you do lavish as much technique as possible,

94
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and you try to make the highest quality hamburger,

95
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
it gets to be a little bit involved.

96
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The New York Times ran a piece

97
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
after my book was delayed

98
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and it was called "The Wait for the 30-Hour Hamburger

99
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Just Got Longer."

100
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Because our hamburger recipe, our ultimate hamburger recipe,

101
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff,

102
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
it does take about 30 hours.

103
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Of course, you're not actually working the whole time.

104
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Most of the time is kind of sitting there.

105
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
The point of this cutaway

106
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
is to show people a view of hamburgers they haven't seen before

107
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and to explain the physics of hamburgers

108
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and the chemistry of hamburgers,

109
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
because, believe it or not, there is something to the physics and chemistry --

110
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
in particular, those flames underneath the burger.

111
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Most of the characteristic char-grilled taste

112
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
doesn't come from the wood or the charcoal.

113
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference.

114
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing, or burning.

115
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So it's the fat that drips down and flares up

116
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that causes the characteristic taste.

117
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Now you might wonder, how do we make these cutaways?

118
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Most people assume we use Photoshop.

119
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And the answer is: no, not really;

120
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
we use a machine shop.

121
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And it turns out, the best way to cut things in half

122
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
is to actually cut them in half.

123
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world.

124
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Laughter)

125
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
We cut a $5,000 restaurant oven in half.

126
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The manufacturer said,

127
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
"What would it take for you to cut one in half?"

128
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I said, "It would have to show up free."

129
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And so it showed up, we used it a little while,

130
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
we cut it in half.

131
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Now you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots.

132
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We would glue a piece of Pyrex

133
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
or heat-resistant glass in front.

134
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We used a red, very high-temperature silicon to do that.

135
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The great thing is, when you cut something in half,

136
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
you have another half.

137
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So you photograph that in exactly the same position,

138
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and then you can substitute in --

139
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and that part does use Photoshop -- just the edges.

140
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So it's very much like in a Hollywood movie

141
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
where a guy flies through the air, supported by wires,

142
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and then they take the wires away digitally

143
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
so you're flying through the air.

144
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
In most cases, though, there was no glass.

145
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Like for the hamburger, we just cut the damn barbecue.

146
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And so those coals that kept falling off the edge,

147
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
we kept having to put them back up.

148
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But again, it only has to work for a thousandth of a second.

149
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The wok shot caught fire three times.

150
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
What happens when you have your wok cut in half

151
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
is the oil goes down into the fire

152
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and whoosh!

153
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
One of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way.

154
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
But hey, they grow back.

155
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
In addition to cutaways,

156
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
we also explain physics.

157
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
This is Fourier's law of heat conduction.

158
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It's a partial differential equation.

159
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
We have the only cookbook in the world

160
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that has partial differential equations in it.

161
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But to make them palatable,

162
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire

163
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and photographed it like this.

164
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We've got lots of little tidbits in the book.

165
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Everybody knows that your various appliances

166
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
have wattage, right?

167
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But you probably don't know that much about James Watt.

168
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But now you will; we put a biography of James Watt in.

169
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It's a little couple paragraphs

170
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to explain why we call that unit of heat the watt,

171
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and where he got his inspiration.

172
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It turned out he was hired by a Scottish distillery

173
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
to understand why they were burning so damn much peat

174
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to distill the whiskey.

175
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We also did a lot of calculation.

176
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I personally wrote thousands of lines of code

177
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to write this cookbook.

178
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Here's a calculation

179
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that shows how the intensity of a barbecue,

180
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
or other radiant heat source, goes

181
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
as you move away from it.

182
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So as you move vertically away from this surface,

183
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
the heat falls off.

184
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
As you move side to side, it moves off.

185
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
That horn-shaped region

186
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
is what we call the sweet spot.

187
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
That's the place where the heat is even to within 10 percent.

188
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So that's the place where you really want to cook.

189
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And it's got this funny horn-shaped thing,

190
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
which as far as I know, again,

191
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
the first cookbook to ever do this.

192
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Now it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it.

193
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
You know, there's two ways

194
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
you can make a product.

195
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
You can do lots of market research

196
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and do focus groups

197
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and figure out what people really want,

198
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
or you can just kind of go for it

199
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and make the book you want and hope other people like it.

200
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Here's a step-by-step that shows grinding hamburger.

201
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
If you really want great hamburger,

202
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain.

203
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And it's really simple, as you can see here.

204
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
As it comes out of the grinder, you just have a little tray,

205
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and you just take it off in little passes,

206
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
build it up, slice it vertically.

207
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Here's the final hamburger.

208
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
This is the 30-hour hamburger.

209
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
We make every aspect of this burger.

210
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
The lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it.

211
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
We also have things about how to make the bun.

212
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
There's a mushroom, ketchup -- it goes on and on.

213
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Now watch closely. This is popcorn. I'll explain it here.

214
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
The popcorn is illustrating

215
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
a key thing in physics.

216
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Isn't that beautiful?

217
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
We have a very high-speed camera,

218
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
which we had lots of fun with on the book.

219
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
The key physics principle here

220
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
is when water boils to steam

221
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
it expands by a factor of 1,600.

222
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
That's what's happening to the water inside that popcorn.

223
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So it's a great illustration of that.

224
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Now I'm going to close with a video that is kind of unusual.

225
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
We have a chapter on gels.

226
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And because people watch Mythbusters and CSI,

227
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I thought, well, let's put in a recipe

228
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
for a ballistics gelatin.

229
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Well, if you have a high-speed camera,

230
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around,

231
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
pretty soon somebody does this.

232
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Gasps)

233
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Now the amazing thing here

234
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
is that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic

235
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
what happens to human flesh when you get shot -- that's why you shouldn't get shot.

236
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
The other amazing thing is, when this ballistics gelatin comes down,

237
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
it falls back down as a nice block.

238
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Anyway, here's the book.

239
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Here it is.

240
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
2,438 pages.

241
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And they're nice big pages too.

242
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
(Applause)

243
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
A friend of mine complained

244
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen,

245
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
so there's a sixth volume

246
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that has washable, waterproof paper.

247
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Applause)

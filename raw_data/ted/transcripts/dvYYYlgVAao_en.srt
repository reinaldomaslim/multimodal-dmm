1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
This is a representation of your brain,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and your brain can be broken into two parts.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
There's the left half, which is the logical side,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and then the right half,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
which is the intuitive.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
then we can plot our brain.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
This would be someone who's entirely intuitive.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So where would you put your brain on this scale?

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes,

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but I think for most people in the audience,

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
your brain is something like this --

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time.

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything.

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
You can be logical and intuitive.

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And so I consider myself one of these people,

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists,

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
who need a good deal of logic

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
to string together these complex ideas.

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But at the same time, we need a good deal of intuition

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to actually make the experiments work.

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
How do we develop this intuition? Well we like to play with stuff.

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So we go out and play with it, and then we see how it acts,

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and then we develop our intuition from there.

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And really you do the same thing.

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So some intuition

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that you may have developed over the years

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
is that one thing is only in one place at a time.

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I mean, it can sound weird to think about

31
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
one thing being in two different places at the same time,

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
but you weren't born with this notion, you developed it.

33
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop.

34
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
He was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it, and he kept falling over.

35
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson,

36
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and that's that large things don't let you get right past them,

37
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and that they stay in one place.

38
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world,

39
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
unless you're a particle physicist.

40
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist,

41
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
because they don't play with car stops,

42
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
they play with these little weird particles.

43
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And when they play with their particles,

44
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
they find they do all sorts of really weird things --

45
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
like they can fly right through walls,

46
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
or they can be in two different places at the same time.

47
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And so they wrote down all these observations,

48
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics.

49
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And so that's where physics was at a few years ago;

50
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
you needed quantum mechanics

51
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to describe little, tiny particles.

52
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But you didn't need it

53
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to describe the large, everyday objects around us.

54
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
This didn't really sit well with my intuition,

55
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often.

56
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Well, I play with them sometimes,

57
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
but not very often.

58
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And I've never seen them.

59
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I mean, nobody's ever seen a particle.

60
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But it didn't sit well with my logical side either.

61
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
Because if everything is made up of little particles

62
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and all the little particles

63
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
follow quantum mechanics,

64
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics?

65
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I don't see any reason why it shouldn't.

66
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing

67
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
if we could somehow show

68
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that an everyday object

69
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
also follows quantum mechanics.

70
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So a few years ago, I set off to do just that.

71
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So I made one.

72
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
This is the first object

73
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that you can see

74
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition.

75
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So what we're looking at here

76
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
is a tiny computer chip.

77
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle.

78
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute.

79
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
This is a photograph of the object.

80
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center.

81
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And then here's a really, really big close-up of the little piece of metal.

82
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal,

83
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a ledge.

84
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And so I made this thing

85
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip.

86
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer,

87
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours.

88
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
For the last stuff, I had to build my own machine --

89
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to make this swimming pool-shaped hole

90
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
underneath the device.

91
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
This device has the ability

92
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to be in a quantum superposition,

93
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but it needs a little help to do it.

94
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Here, let me give you an analogy.

95
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator?

96
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I mean, when I'm in an elevator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things,

97
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
but then other people get on board

98
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and I stop doing those things

99
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
because I don't want to bother them,

100
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
or, frankly, scare them.

101
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So quantum mechanics says

102
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that inanimate objects feel the same way.

103
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The fellow passengers for inanimate objects

104
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
are not just people,

105
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but it's also the light shining on it

106
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room.

107
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And so we knew, if we wanted to see

108
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically,

109
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers.

110
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And so that's what we did.

111
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
We turned off the lights,

112
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air,

113
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and then we cooled it down

114
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero.

115
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Now, all alone in the elevator,

116
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted.

117
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And so we measured its motion.

118
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We found it was moving in really weird ways.

119
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating,

120
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this --

121
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
like expanding and contracting bellows.

122
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And by giving it a gentle nudge,

123
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
we were able to make it both vibrate

124
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and not vibrate

125
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
at the same time --

126
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics.

127
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic.

128
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
What does it mean for one thing

129
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to be both vibrating and not vibrating

130
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
at the same time?

131
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So let's think about the atoms.

132
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So in one case:

133
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal

134
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
are sitting still

135
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and at the same time those same atoms

136
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
are moving up and down.

137
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Now it's only at precise times when they align.

138
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The rest of the time they're delocalized.

139
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
That means that every atom

140
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
is in two different places at the same time,

141
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
which in turn means the entire chunk of metal

142
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
is in two different places.

143
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I think this is really cool.

144
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
(Laughter)

145
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Really.

146
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Applause)

147
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years

148
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
because, check this out,

149
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the difference in scale

150
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
between a single atom and that chunk of metal

151
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is about the same as the difference

152
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
between that chunk of metal and you.

153
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time,

154
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that chunk of metal can be in two different places,

155
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
then why not you?

156
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I mean, this is just my logical side talking.

157
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time,

158
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
what would that be like?

159
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
How would your consciousness

160
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
handle your body being delocalized in space?

161
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
There's one more part to the story.

162
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
It's when we warmed it up,

163
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box,

164
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece.

165
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And so I had to develop this new intuition,

166
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that it seems like all the objects in the elevator

167
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
are really just quantum objects

168
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
just crammed into a tiny space.

169
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
You hear a lot of talk

170
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected.

171
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Well, that's not quite right.

172
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It's more than that; it's deeper.

173
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It's that those connections,

174
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
your connections to all the things around you,

175
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
literally define who you are,

176
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics.

177
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Thank you.

178
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000

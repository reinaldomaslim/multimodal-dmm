1
0:00:17.154,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I am an immigrant from Uganda living in the United States

2
0:00:21.083,000 --> 0:00:23,000
while waiting for my asylum application

3
0:00:23.768,000 --> 0:00:24,000
to go through.

4
0:00:25.723,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Migrants do not enjoy much freedom of movement

5
0:00:29.015,000 --> 0:00:3,000
in our world today.

6
0:00:30.802,000 --> 0:00:33,000
This certainly applies to those who are desperate enough

7
0:00:33.997,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to navigate choppy and stormy seas in boats.

8
0:00:37.352,000 --> 0:00:41,000
These are the risks my cousins from West Africa and North Africa face

9
0:00:42.148,000 --> 0:00:44,000
while trying to cross over to Europe.

10
0:00:44.474,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Indeed, it is a rare but fortunate opportunity

11
0:00:48.325,000 --> 0:00:51,000
for a migrant to address a gathering like this.

12
0:00:52.259,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But this also signifies what often is missing

13
0:00:55.43,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in the global debate over refugees,

14
0:00:58.128,000 --> 0:01:,000
migrants and immigrants,

15
0:01:00.51,000 --> 0:01:02,000
voices of the disenfranchised.

16
0:01:03.503,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Citizens of many host countries,

17
0:01:05.49,000 --> 0:01:07,000
even those that previously welcomed newcomers,

18
0:01:08.429,000 --> 0:01:11,000
are uneasy about the rising numbers of individuals

19
0:01:11.735,000 --> 0:01:13,000
coming into their countries.

20
0:01:13.977,000 --> 0:01:16,000
The immediate criticism is that the newcomers upend the stability

21
0:01:17.996,000 --> 0:01:2,000
of social welfare and employment in their countries.

22
0:01:21.177,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Uncertain and skeptical citizens look towards politicians

23
0:01:24.919,000 --> 0:01:28,000
who are competing against each other to see who can claim the prize

24
0:01:29.731,000 --> 0:01:32,000
of the loudest voice of populism and nationalism.

25
0:01:33.917,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It is a contest of who is the toughest on migrants,

26
0:01:38.354,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the most willing to impose travel bans

27
0:01:40.609,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and the most eager to propose projects in building walls.

28
0:01:44.782,000 --> 0:01:47,000
All these restrictions simply address symptoms of the problem,

29
0:01:48.467,000 --> 0:01:49,000
not the causes.

30
0:01:49.912,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Why are they coming?

31
0:01:52.221,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Migrants can share perspectives,

32
0:01:53.95,000 --> 0:01:56,000
if only politicians would be willing to listen.

33
0:01:57.59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
In Dubai, I chronicled injustices and inequalities inflicted regularly

34
0:02:01.782,000 --> 0:02:02,000
on the migrant labor force.

35
0:02:03.69,000 --> 0:02:06,000
As a result, pressures from the governments

36
0:02:06.781,000 --> 0:02:07,000
of the respective countries

37
0:02:08.268,000 --> 0:02:12,000
led to me being forced out of my career as a journalist in the Middle East.

38
0:02:13.747,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I was deported to Uganda,

39
0:02:15.274,000 --> 0:02:19,000
where economic deprivation puts everyone at the risk of starvation.

40
0:02:19.955,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I fled Uganda to come to the United States

41
0:02:22.646,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in the hope of sustaining a voice for my brothers and sisters

42
0:02:26.78,000 --> 0:02:29,000
who experience a more serious plight as migrants.

43
0:02:30.707,000 --> 0:02:33,000
My father told me he was not happy about me writing a book

44
0:02:34.389,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that risked deportation and unemployment.

45
0:02:38.141,000 --> 0:02:41,000
He had been diabetic for many years when I still worked in Dubai,

46
0:02:41.639,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and my salary was always sufficient to pay for his treatments.

47
0:02:45.854,000 --> 0:02:46,000
After I was expelled,

48
0:02:47.648,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I could not afford to sustain his treatment,

49
0:02:50.54,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and even in the last days of his life,

50
0:02:53.308,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I could not afford to take him to a hospital.

51
0:02:56.911,000 --> 0:02:59,000
As I carried his body in my hands to lay it in the ground

52
0:03:00.707,000 --> 0:03:01,000
in June of last year,

53
0:03:02.368,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I realized I had paid a profound price

54
0:03:05.826,000 --> 0:03:06,000
for amplifying my voice.

55
0:03:09.482,000 --> 0:03:15,000
The act of speaking up against injustices that are multilayered is never easy,

56
0:03:16.257,000 --> 0:03:19,000
because the problems require more than just rhetoric.

57
0:03:20.165,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So long as gold mines, oilfields and large farms in Africa continue to be owned

58
0:03:26.846,000 --> 0:03:27,000
by foreign investors

59
0:03:28.618,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and those vital resources are shipped to the West,

60
0:03:32.188,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the stream of African migrants will flow continuously.

61
0:03:37.423,000 --> 0:03:41,000
There are no restrictions that could ever be so rigorous

62
0:03:42.076,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to stop the wave of migration that has determined our human history.

63
0:03:47.609,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Before border controls can be tightened

64
0:03:50.498,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and new visa restrictions imposed,

65
0:03:53.486,000 --> 0:03:55,000
countries that have long received migrants

66
0:03:56.055,000 --> 0:03:59,000
should engage in a more open discussion.

67
0:03:59.397,000 --> 0:04:03,000
That is the only practical start for reconciling, finally,

68
0:04:05.217,000 --> 0:04:07,000
a legacy of exploitation,

69
0:04:08.713,000 --> 0:04:09,000
slavery,

70
0:04:10.253,000 --> 0:04:11,000
colonialism

71
0:04:11.677,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and imperialism,

72
0:04:13.481,000 --> 0:04:18,000
so that together, we can move forward in creating a more just global economy

73
0:04:19.752,000 --> 0:04:2,000
in the 21st century --

74
0:04:22.087,000 --> 0:04:24,000
one that benefits all.

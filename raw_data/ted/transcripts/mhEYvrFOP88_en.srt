1
0:00:13.28,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Computer algorithms today are performing incredible tasks

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
with high accuracies, at a massive scale, using human-like intelligence.

3
0:00:21.92,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And this intelligence of computers is often referred to as AI

4
0:00:25.88,000 --> 0:00:26,000
or artificial intelligence.

5
0:00:27.76,000 --> 0:00:31,000
AI is poised to make an incredible impact on our lives in the future.

6
0:00:32.88,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Today, however, we still face massive challenges

7
0:00:36.84,000 --> 0:00:39,000
in detecting and diagnosing several life-threatening illnesses,

8
0:00:40.36,000 --> 0:00:42,000
such as infectious diseases and cancer.

9
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Thousands of patients every year

10
0:00:46.32,000 --> 0:00:48,000
lose their lives due to liver and oral cancer.

11
0:00:49.88,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Our best way to help these patients

12
0:00:52.6,000 --> 0:00:56,000
is to perform early detection and diagnoses of these diseases.

13
0:00:57.88,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So how do we detect these diseases today, and can artificial intelligence help?

14
0:01:03.92,000 --> 0:01:06,000
In patients who, unfortunately, are suspected of these diseases,

15
0:01:07.6,000 --> 0:01:09,000
an expert physician first orders

16
0:01:10.28,000 --> 0:01:12,000
very expensive medical imaging technologies

17
0:01:12.92,000 --> 0:01:16,000
such as fluorescent imaging, CTs, MRIs, to be performed.

18
0:01:17.04,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Once those images are collected,

19
0:01:19.36,000 --> 0:01:23,000
another expert physician then diagnoses those images and talks to the patient.

20
0:01:24.52,000 --> 0:01:27,000
As you can see, this is a very resource-intensive process,

21
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:32,000
requiring both expert physicians, expensive medical imaging technologies,

22
0:01:32.44,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and is not considered practical for the developing world.

23
0:01:35.56,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And in fact, in many industrialized nations, as well.

24
0:01:39.76,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So, can we solve this problem using artificial intelligence?

25
0:01:43.84,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Today, if I were to use traditional artificial intelligence architectures

26
0:01:47.92,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to solve this problem,

27
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I would require 10,000 --

28
0:01:50.64,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I repeat, on an order of 10,000 of these very expensive medical images

29
0:01:54.68,000 --> 0:01:55,000
first to be generated.

30
0:01:56.08,000 --> 0:01:58,000
After that, I would then go to an expert physician,

31
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
who would then analyze those images for me.

32
0:02:01.52,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And using those two pieces of information,

33
0:02:03.64,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I can train a standard deep neural network or a deep learning network

34
0:02:07.32,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to provide patient's diagnosis.

35
0:02:09.48,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Similar to the first approach,

36
0:02:11.24,000 --> 0:02:13,000
traditional artificial intelligence approaches

37
0:02:13.407,000 --> 0:02:14,000
suffer from the same problem.

38
0:02:14.88,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Large amounts of data, expert physicians and expert medical imaging technologies.

39
0:02:20.32,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So, can we invent more scalable, effective

40
0:02:24.64,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and more valuable artificial intelligence architectures

41
0:02:27.96,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to solve these very important problems facing us today?

42
0:02:31.04,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And this is exactly what my group at MIT Media Lab does.

43
0:02:34.36,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We have invented a variety of unorthodox AI architectures

44
0:02:38.24,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to solve some of the most important challenges facing us today

45
0:02:41.44,000 --> 0:02:43,000
in medical imaging and clinical trials.

46
0:02:44.48,000 --> 0:02:47,000
In the example I shared with you today, we had two goals.

47
0:02:47.56,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Our first goal was to reduce the number of images

48
0:02:50.56,000 --> 0:02:53,000
required to train artificial intelligence algorithms.

49
0:02:53.84,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Our second goal -- we were more ambitious,

50
0:02:55.96,000 --> 0:02:58,000
we wanted to reduce the use of expensive medical imaging technologies

51
0:02:59.72,000 --> 0:03:,000
to screen patients.

52
0:03:00.96,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So how did we do it?

53
0:03:02.92,000 --> 0:03:03,000
For our first goal,

54
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
instead of starting with tens and thousands

55
0:03:06.24,000 --> 0:03:09,000
of these very expensive medical images, like traditional AI,

56
0:03:09.28,000 --> 0:03:11,000
we started with a single medical image.

57
0:03:11.36,000 --> 0:03:14,000
From this image, my team and I figured out a very clever way

58
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
to extract billions of information packets.

59
0:03:17.92,000 --> 0:03:2,000
These information packets included colors, pixels, geometry

60
0:03:21.64,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and rendering of the disease on the medical image.

61
0:03:24.2,000 --> 0:03:28,000
In a sense, we converted one image into billions of training data points,

62
0:03:28.56,000 --> 0:03:31,000
massively reducing the amount of data needed for training.

63
0:03:32.12,000 --> 0:03:33,000
For our second goal,

64
0:03:33.36,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to reduce the use of expensive medical imaging technologies to screen patients,

65
0:03:37.24,000 --> 0:03:39,000
we started with a standard, white light photograph,

66
0:03:40.12,000 --> 0:03:44,000
acquired either from a DSLR camera or a mobile phone, for the patient.

67
0:03:44.48,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Then remember those billions of information packets?

68
0:03:46.96,000 --> 0:03:49,000
We overlaid those from the medical image onto this image,

69
0:03:50.52,000 --> 0:03:52,000
creating something that we call a composite image.

70
0:03:53.48,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Much to our surprise, we only required 50 --

71
0:03:56.8,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I repeat, only 50 --

72
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
of these composite images to train our algorithms to high efficiencies.

73
0:04:02.68,000 --> 0:04:03,000
To summarize our approach,

74
0:04:04.04,000 --> 0:04:07,000
instead of using 10,000 very expensive medical images,

75
0:04:07.24,000 --> 0:04:1,000
we can now train the AI algorithms in an unorthodox way,

76
0:04:10.28,000 --> 0:04:14,000
using only 50 of these high-resolution, but standard photographs,

77
0:04:14.56,000 --> 0:04:16,000
acquired from DSLR cameras and mobile phones,

78
0:04:17.08,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and provide diagnosis.

79
0:04:18.64,000 --> 0:04:19,000
More importantly,

80
0:04:19.88,000 --> 0:04:22,000
our algorithms can accept, in the future and even right now,

81
0:04:23.04,000 --> 0:04:25,000
some very simple, white light photographs from the patient,

82
0:04:25.88,000 --> 0:04:27,000
instead of expensive medical imaging technologies.

83
0:04:29.12,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I believe that we are poised to enter an era

84
0:04:32.24,000 --> 0:04:33,000
where artificial intelligence

85
0:04:34.2,000 --> 0:04:36,000
is going to make an incredible impact on our future.

86
0:04:36.76,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And I think that thinking about traditional AI,

87
0:04:39.24,000 --> 0:04:41,000
which is data-rich but application-poor,

88
0:04:42.04,000 --> 0:04:43,000
we should also continue thinking

89
0:04:43.6,000 --> 0:04:46,000
about unorthodox artificial intelligence architectures,

90
0:04:46.64,000 --> 0:04:47,000
which can accept small amounts of data

91
0:04:48.6,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and solve some of the most important problems facing us today,

92
0:04:51.56,000 --> 0:04:52,000
especially in health care.

93
0:04:52.84,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Thank you very much.

94
0:04:54.08,000 --> 0:04:57,000
(Applause)

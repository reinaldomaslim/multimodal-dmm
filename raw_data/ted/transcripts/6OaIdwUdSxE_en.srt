2
0:00:16.22,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Let me tell you a story.

3
0:00:18.228,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It's my first year as a new high school science teacher,

4
0:00:21.999,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and I'm so eager.

5
0:00:23.787,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I'm so excited, I'm pouring myself into my lesson plans.

6
0:00:28.953,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But I'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization

7
0:00:33.81,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that my students just might not be learning anything.

8
0:00:38.865,000 --> 0:00:39,000
This happens one day:

9
0:00:40.596,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter

10
0:00:43.754,000 --> 0:00:46,000
about my favorite subject in all of biology:

11
0:00:47.495,000 --> 0:00:49,000
viruses and how they attack.

12
0:00:50.987,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And so I'm so excited to discuss this with them,

13
0:00:53.339,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and I come in and I say, "Can somebody please explain

14
0:00:56.71,000 --> 0:00:59,000
the main ideas and why this is so cool?"

15
0:01:01.072,000 --> 0:01:02,000
There's silence.

16
0:01:04.612,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Finally, my favorite student, she looks me straight in the eye,

17
0:01:07.596,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and she says, "The reading sucked."

18
0:01:10.517,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:12.785,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And then she clarified.

20
0:01:14.104,000 --> 0:01:16,000
She said, "You know what, I don't mean that it sucks.

21
0:01:16.627,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I mean I didn't understand a word of it.

22
0:01:18.689,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It's boring, who cares, and it sucks."

23
0:01:22.713,000 --> 0:01:23,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:24.593,000 --> 0:01:28,000
These sympathetic smiles spread all throughout the room now,

25
0:01:29.483,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and I realize that all of my other students are in the same boat,

26
0:01:34.316,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that maybe they took notes or memorized definitions from the textbook,

27
0:01:38.228,000 --> 0:01:43,000
but not one of them really understood the main ideas.

28
0:01:43.331,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Not one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool,

29
0:01:46.005,000 --> 0:01:47,000
why it's so important.

30
0:01:49.497,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I'm totally clueless.

31
0:01:51.441,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I have no idea what to do next.

32
0:01:54.711,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So the only thing I can think of is say,

33
0:01:57.647,000 --> 0:01:59,000
"Listen. Let me tell you a story.

34
0:02:01.566,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses.

35
0:02:07.615,000 --> 0:02:09,000
These guys are blown up a couple million times.

36
0:02:11.091,000 --> 0:02:14,000
The real bacteria and viruses are so small

37
0:02:14.257,000 --> 0:02:16,000
we can't see them without a microscope,

38
0:02:16.535,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and you guys might know bacteria and viruses

39
0:02:18.669,000 --> 0:02:19,000
because they both make us sick.

40
0:02:20.796,000 --> 0:02:21,000
But what a lot of people don't know

41
0:02:22.716,000 --> 0:02:25,000
is that viruses can also make bacteria sick."

42
0:02:27.319,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Now, the story that I start telling my kids,

43
0:02:29.819,000 --> 0:02:32,000
it starts out like a horror story.

44
0:02:34.147,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Once upon a time, there's this happy little bacterium.

45
0:02:37.75,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Don't get too attached to him.

46
0:02:39.241,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:40.957,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Maybe he's floating around in your stomach

48
0:02:43.647,000 --> 0:02:45,000
or in some spoiled food somewhere,

49
0:02:45.845,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and all of a sudden, he starts to not feel so good.

50
0:02:49.473,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Maybe he ate something bad for lunch.

51
0:02:52.075,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And then things get really horrible,

52
0:02:54.638,000 --> 0:02:55,000
as his skin rips apart,

53
0:02:56.259,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and he sees a virus coming out from his insides.

54
0:03:00.765,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And then it gets horrible when he bursts open

55
0:03:04.335,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and an army of viruses floods out from his insides.

56
0:03:09.896,000 --> 0:03:1,000
"Ouch" is right.

57
0:03:12.903,000 --> 0:03:14,000
If you see this, and you're a bacterium,

58
0:03:15.451,000 --> 0:03:17,000
this is like your worst nightmare.

59
0:03:18.673,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But if you're a virus and you see this,

60
0:03:21.053,000 --> 0:03:24,000
you cross those little legs of yours and you think,

61
0:03:24.093,000 --> 0:03:25,000
"We rock."

62
0:03:25.989,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium.

63
0:03:31.43,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Here's what had to happen.

64
0:03:33.247,000 --> 0:03:36,000
A virus grabbed onto a bacterium

65
0:03:36.453,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and it slipped its DNA into it.

66
0:03:40.063,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The next thing is that virus DNA made stuff

67
0:03:43.444,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that chopped up the bacteria DNA.

68
0:03:47.705,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And now that we've gotten rid of the bacteria DNA,

69
0:03:50.165,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the virus DNA takes control of the cell

70
0:03:53.994,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and it tells it to start making more viruses.

71
0:03:58.613,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Because, you see, DNA is like a blueprint

72
0:04:01.819,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that tells living things what to make.

73
0:04:05.423,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So this is kind of like going into a car factory

74
0:04:08.827,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer robots.

75
0:04:14.525,000 --> 0:04:16,000
The workers still come the next day, they do their job,

76
0:04:17.493,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but they're following different instructions.

77
0:04:20.784,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So replacing the bacteria DNA with virus DNA

78
0:04:24.561,000 --> 0:04:28,000
turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses --

79
0:04:29.407,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that is, until it's so filled with viruses that it bursts.

80
0:04:34.156,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But that's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria.

81
0:04:38.085,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Some are much more crafty.

82
0:04:41.567,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:44.251,000 --> 0:04:48,000
When a secret agent virus infects a bacterium,

84
0:04:49.06,000 --> 0:04:5,000
they do a little espionage.

85
0:04:51.495,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Here, this cloaked, secret agent virus

86
0:04:55.62,000 --> 0:04:57,000
is slipping his DNA into the bacterial cell,

87
0:04:58.407,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but here's the kicker:

88
0:05:00.026,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It doesn't do anything harmful -- not at first.

89
0:05:04.303,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Instead, it silently slips into the bacteria's own DNA,

90
0:05:09.882,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell,

91
0:05:14.604,000 --> 0:05:16,000
waiting for instructions.

92
0:05:17.474,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And what's interesting about this is now, whenever this bacteria has babies,

93
0:05:23.196,000 --> 0:05:28,000
the babies also have the virus DNA in them.

94
0:05:29.013,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So now we have a whole extended bacteria family,

95
0:05:32.87,000 --> 0:05:34,000
filled with virus sleeper cells.

96
0:05:36.366,000 --> 0:05:4,000
They're just happily living together until a signal happens

97
0:05:41.135,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and bam! -- all of the DNA pops out.

98
0:05:45.603,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It takes control of these cells, turns them into virus-making factories,

99
0:05:49.269,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and they all burst,

100
0:05:51.085,000 --> 0:05:53,000
a huge, extended bacteria family,

101
0:05:53.807,000 --> 0:05:56,000
all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts,

102
0:05:56.952,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the viruses taking over the bacterium.

103
0:06:01.92,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So now you understand how viruses can attack cells.

104
0:06:06.015,000 --> 0:06:07,000
There are two ways:

105
0:06:07.643,000 --> 0:06:09,000
On the left is what we call the lytic way,

106
0:06:10.626,000 --> 0:06:13,000
where the viruses go right in and take over the cells.

107
0:06:14.538,000 --> 0:06:17,000
On the [right] is the lysogenic way

108
0:06:17.633,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that uses secret agent viruses.

109
0:06:21.204,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So this stuff is not that hard, right?

110
0:06:23.482,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And now all of you understand it.

111
0:06:25.505,000 --> 0:06:26,000
But if you've graduated from high school,

112
0:06:27.52,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I can almost guarantee you've seen this information before.

113
0:06:30.806,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But I bet it was presented in a way that it didn't exactly stick in your mind.

114
0:06:37.379,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So when my students were first learning this,

115
0:06:40.871,000 --> 0:06:41,000
why did they hate it so much?

116
0:06:43.212,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Well, there were a couple of reasons.

117
0:06:45.37,000 --> 0:06:47,000
First of all, I can guarantee you

118
0:06:47.545,000 --> 0:06:5,000
you that their textbooks didn't have secret agent viruses,

119
0:06:50.951,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and they didn't have horror stories.

120
0:06:53.94,000 --> 0:06:55,000
You know, in the communication of science,

121
0:06:56.67,000 --> 0:07:,000
there is this obsession with seriousness.

122
0:07:00.718,000 --> 0:07:02,000
It kills me. I'm not kidding.

123
0:07:02.844,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I used to work for an educational publisher,

124
0:07:05.097,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and as a writer, I was always told never to use stories

125
0:07:08.78,000 --> 0:07:09,000
or fun, engaging language,

126
0:07:10.692,000 --> 0:07:14,000
because then my work might not be viewed as "serious" and "scientific."

127
0:07:16.108,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I mean, because God forbid somebody have fun

128
0:07:19.203,000 --> 0:07:2,000
when they're learning science.

129
0:07:20.995,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So we have this field of science that's all about slime

130
0:07:25.857,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and color changes.

131
0:07:28.224,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Check this out.

132
0:07:39.756,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And then we have, of course, as any good scientist has to have ...

133
0:07:44.375,000 --> 0:07:45,000
explosions!

134
0:07:47.163,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But if a textbook seems too much fun,

135
0:07:51.853,000 --> 0:07:53,000
it's somehow unscientific.

136
0:07:55.771,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Now another problem

137
0:07:58.598,000 --> 0:08:03,000
was that the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible.

138
0:08:04.978,000 --> 0:08:06,000
If we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier,

139
0:08:07.787,000 --> 0:08:08,000
we could start by saying,

140
0:08:09.097,000 --> 0:08:11,000
"These viruses make copies of themselves

141
0:08:11.263,000 --> 0:08:13,000
by slipping their DNA into a bacterium."

142
0:08:14.263,000 --> 0:08:17,000
The way this showed up in the textbook, it looked like this:

143
0:08:17.628,000 --> 0:08:2,000
"Bacteriophage replication is initiated

144
0:08:20.866,000 --> 0:08:24,000
through the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a bacterium."

145
0:08:26.225,000 --> 0:08:3,000
That's great, perfect for 13-year-olds.

146
0:08:31.312,000 --> 0:08:32,000
But here's the thing:

147
0:08:32.517,000 --> 0:08:34,000
There are plenty of people in science education

148
0:08:35.091,000 --> 0:08:37,000
who would look at this and say there's no way

149
0:08:37.271,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that we could ever give that to students,

150
0:08:39.712,000 --> 0:08:43,000
because it contains some language that isn't completely accurate.

151
0:08:44.926,000 --> 0:08:46,000
For example, I told you that viruses have DNA.

152
0:08:47.783,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Well, a very tiny fraction of them don't.

153
0:08:50.41,000 --> 0:08:51,000
They have something called RNA instead.

154
0:08:52.725,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So a professional science writer would say, "That has to go.

155
0:08:56.051,000 --> 0:08:58,000
We have to change it to something much more technical."

156
0:08:58.665,000 --> 0:09:,000
And after a team of professional science editors

157
0:09:01.417,000 --> 0:09:04,000
went over this really simple explanation,

158
0:09:05.25,000 --> 0:09:09,000
they'd find fault with almost every word I've used,

159
0:09:09.678,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and they'd have to change anything that wasn't serious enough,

160
0:09:12.607,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and they'd have to change everything

161
0:09:14.346,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that wasn't 100 percent perfect.

162
0:09:17.804,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Then it would be accurate,

163
0:09:19.692,000 --> 0:09:23,000
but it would be completely impossible to understand.

164
0:09:24.565,000 --> 0:09:25,000
This is horrifying.

165
0:09:26.813,000 --> 0:09:3,000
You know, I keep talking about this idea of telling a story,

166
0:09:31.706,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and it's like science communication has taken on this idea

167
0:09:36.301,000 --> 0:09:39,000
of what I call the tyranny of precision,

168
0:09:39.38,000 --> 0:09:41,000
where you can't just tell a story.

169
0:09:41.535,000 --> 0:09:46,000
It's like science has become that horrible storyteller that we all know

170
0:09:47.177,000 --> 0:09:49,000
who gives us all the details nobody cares about,

171
0:09:49.796,000 --> 0:09:52,000
where you're like, "Oh, I met my friend for lunch the other day,

172
0:09:53.645,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and she was wearing these ugly jeans.

173
0:09:55.462,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I mean, they weren't really jeans, they were more like leggings,

174
0:09:58.486,000 --> 0:10:,000
but I guess they're actually kind of more like jeggings,

175
0:10:01.144,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and you're just like, "Oh my God. What is the point?"

176
0:10:06.036,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Or even worse, science education is becoming

177
0:10:10.02,000 --> 0:10:13,000
like that guy who always says, "Actually."

178
0:10:13.995,000 --> 0:10:14,000
You want to be like,

179
0:10:15.875,000 --> 0:10:18,000
"Oh, dude, we had to get up in the middle of the night

180
0:10:19.01,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and drive a hundred miles in total darkness."

181
0:10:21.716,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And that guy's like, "Actually, it was 87.3 miles."

182
0:10:26.398,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And you're like, "Actually, shut up! I'm just trying to tell a story."

183
0:10:33.731,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Because good storytelling is all about emotional connection.

184
0:10:39.27,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We have to convince our audience

185
0:10:41.821,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that what we're talking about matters.

186
0:10:44.805,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But just as important is knowing which details we should leave out

187
0:10:50.06,000 --> 0:10:52,000
so that the main point still comes across.

188
0:10:53.539,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I'm reminded of what the architect Mies van der Rohe said,

189
0:10:56.546,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and I paraphrase, when he said that sometimes,

190
0:10:59.935,000 --> 0:11:01,000
you have to lie in order to tell the truth.

191
0:11:03.498,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I think this sentiment is particularly relevant to science education.

192
0:11:10.212,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Now, finally, I am often so disappointed

193
0:11:17.002,000 --> 0:11:21,000
when people think that I'm advocating a dumbing down of science.

194
0:11:22.208,000 --> 0:11:23,000
That's not true at all.

195
0:11:23.906,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I'm currently a Ph.D. student at MIT,

196
0:11:26.707,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and I absolutely understand the importance of detailed,

197
0:11:31.713,000 --> 0:11:35,000
specific scientific communication between experts,

198
0:11:36.606,000 --> 0:11:39,000
but not when we're trying to teach 13-year-olds.

199
0:11:41.116,000 --> 0:11:46,000
If a young learner thinks that all viruses have DNA,

200
0:11:46.212,000 --> 0:11:5,000
that's not going to ruin their chances of success in science.

201
0:11:51.726,000 --> 0:11:54,000
But if a young learner can't understand anything in science

202
0:11:55.305,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this,

203
0:11:59.264,000 --> 0:12:01,000
that will ruin their chances of success.

204
0:12:04.025,000 --> 0:12:05,000
This needs to stop ...

205
0:12:06.378,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and I wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top

206
0:12:10.196,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that are perpetuating these problems,

207
0:12:11.982,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and I beg them, I beseech them to just stop it.

208
0:12:16.788,000 --> 0:12:17,000
But I think that's unlikely.

209
0:12:18.769,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So we are so lucky that we have resources

210
0:12:22.332,000 --> 0:12:25,000
like the Internet, where we can circumvent these institutions

211
0:12:25.49,000 --> 0:12:27,000
from the bottom up.

212
0:12:28.853,000 --> 0:12:3,000
There's a growing number of online resources

213
0:12:31.765,000 --> 0:12:34,000
that are dedicated to just explaining science

214
0:12:35.091,000 --> 0:12:37,000
in simple, understandable ways.

215
0:12:38.194,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I dream of a Wikipedia-like website

216
0:12:40.574,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that would explain any scientific concept you can think of

217
0:12:44.297,000 --> 0:12:47,000
in simple language any middle schooler can understand.

218
0:12:48.781,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And I myself spend most of my free time

219
0:12:52.249,000 --> 0:12:55,000
making these science videos that I put on YouTube.

220
0:12:55.873,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I explain chemical equilibrium

221
0:12:58.107,000 --> 0:13:01,000
using analogies to awkward middle school dances,

222
0:13:01.611,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and I talk about fuel cells

223
0:13:03.341,000 --> 0:13:06,000
with stories about boys and girls at a summer camp.

224
0:13:07.506,000 --> 0:13:1,000
The feedback that I get is sometimes misspelled

225
0:13:10.934,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and it's often written in LOLcats,

226
0:13:13.101,000 --> 0:13:14,000
(Laughter)

227
0:13:14.339,000 --> 0:13:19,000
but nonetheless, it's so appreciative, so thankful

228
0:13:20.283,000 --> 0:13:26,000
that I know this is the right way we should be communicating science.

229
0:13:27.333,000 --> 0:13:3,000
There's still so much work left to be done, though,

230
0:13:30.404,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and if you're involved with science in any way,

231
0:13:33.666,000 --> 0:13:35,000
I urge you to join me.

232
0:13:36.356,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Pick up a camera, start to write a blog, whatever,

233
0:13:41.74,000 --> 0:13:44,000
but leave out the seriousness, leave out the jargon.

234
0:13:45.589,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Make me laugh. Make me care.

235
0:13:48.984,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about

236
0:13:52.563,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and just get to the point.

237
0:13:56.309,000 --> 0:13:57,000
How should you start?

238
0:13:58.174,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Why don't you say, "Listen, let me tell you a story."

239
0:14:03.323,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Thank you.

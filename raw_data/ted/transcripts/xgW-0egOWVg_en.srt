1
0:00:12.792,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So I've got something that I'm slightly embarrassed to admit to.

2
0:00:17.792,000 --> 0:00:18,000
At the age of 17,

3
0:00:19.375,000 --> 0:00:2,000
as a creationist,

4
0:00:21.208,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I decided to go to university to study evolution

5
0:00:24.833,000 --> 0:00:25,000
so that I could destroy it.

6
0:00:26.458,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:28.167,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I failed.

8
0:00:29.458,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I failed so spectacularly that I'm now an evolutionary biologist.

9
0:00:33.333,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Applause)

10
0:00:36.167,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So I'm a paleoanthropologist, I'm a National Geographic Explorer

11
0:00:39.5,000 --> 0:00:41,000
specializing in fossil hunting in caves

12
0:00:42.167,000 --> 0:00:44,000
in unstable, hostile and disputed territories.

13
0:00:45.958,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And we all know that if I was a guy and not a girl,

14
0:00:49.5,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that wouldn't be a job description, that would be a pick-up line.

15
0:00:52.708,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:54.917,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Now, here's the thing. I do not have a death wish.

17
0:00:57.375,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I'm not an adrenaline junkie.

18
0:00:59.542,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I just looked at a map.

19
0:01:02.083,000 --> 0:01:06,000
See, frontline exploratory science does not happen as much

20
0:01:06.333,000 --> 0:01:08,000
in politically unstable territories.

21
0:01:09.542,000 --> 0:01:12,000
This is a map of all the places which the British Foreign Office

22
0:01:13.333,000 --> 0:01:16,000
have declared contain red zones, orange zones

23
0:01:16.542,000 --> 0:01:19,000
or have raised some kind of a threat warning about.

24
0:01:19.833,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Now I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that it is a tragedy

25
0:01:23.042,000 --> 0:01:27,000
if we're not doing frontline exploratory science in a huge portion of the planet.

26
0:01:28.042,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And so science has a geography problem.

27
0:01:32.75,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Also, as a paleoanthropologist,

28
0:01:35.417,000 --> 0:01:38,000
guys, this is basically a map of some of the most important places

29
0:01:38.625,000 --> 0:01:39,000
in the human journey.

30
0:01:40.417,000 --> 0:01:44,000
There are almost definitely fascinating fossils to be found here.

31
0:01:44.625,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But are we looking for them?

32
0:01:47.417,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And so as an undergraduate, I was repeatedly told

33
0:01:50.958,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that humans, be they ourselves, homo sapiens, or earlier species,

34
0:01:55.542,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that we left Africa via the Sinai of Egypt.

35
0:02:00.25,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I'm English, as you can probably tell from my accent,

36
0:02:03.5,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but I am actually of Arab heritage,

37
0:02:05.542,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and I always say that I'm very, very Arab on the outside.

38
0:02:08.25,000 --> 0:02:09,000
You know, I can really be passionate.

39
0:02:10.083,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Like, "You're amazing! I love you!"

40
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
But on the inside, I'm really English, so everybody irritates me.

41
0:02:15.25,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:20.208,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It's true.

43
0:02:21.5,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And the thing is, my family are Arab from Yemen,

44
0:02:25.042,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and I knew that that channel,

45
0:02:28.667,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Bab-el-Mandeb,

46
0:02:30.083,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is not that much of a feat to cross.

47
0:02:32.833,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And I kept asking myself this really simple question:

48
0:02:36.625,000 --> 0:02:41,000
if the ancestors to New World monkeys could somehow cross the Atlantic Ocean,

49
0:02:42.083,000 --> 0:02:45,000
why couldn't humans cross that tiny stretch of water?

50
0:02:46.708,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But the thing is, Yemen,

51
0:02:48.375,000 --> 0:02:49,000
compared to, let's say, Europe,

52
0:02:50.375,000 --> 0:02:52,000
was so understudied

53
0:02:52.458,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that it was something akin to near virgin territory.

54
0:02:56.917,000 --> 0:03:02,000
But that, along with its location, made the sheer potential for discovery

55
0:03:03.375,000 --> 0:03:05,000
so exciting,

56
0:03:05.5,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and I had so many questions.

57
0:03:08.375,000 --> 0:03:11,000
When did we first start using Bab-el-Mandeb?

58
0:03:11.458,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But also, which species of human besides ourselves made it to Yemen?

59
0:03:16.25,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Might we find a species as yet unknown to science?

60
0:03:20.125,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And it turned out, I wasn't the only one who had noticed Yemen's potential.

61
0:03:24.667,000 --> 0:03:26,000
There was actually a few other academics out there.

62
0:03:27.333,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But sadly, due to political instability, they moved out, and so I moved in.

63
0:03:32.375,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And I was looking for caves:

64
0:03:35.583,000 --> 0:03:4,000
caves because caves are the original prime real estate.

65
0:03:40.667,000 --> 0:03:43,000
But also because if you're looking for fossils in that kind of heat,

66
0:03:44.667,000 --> 0:03:48,000
your best bet for fossil preservation is always going to be caves.

67
0:03:48.75,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But then, Yemen took a really sad turn for the worse,

68
0:03:53.5,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and just a few days before I was due to fly out to Yemen,

69
0:03:57.417,000 --> 0:04:,000
the civil war escalated into a regional conflict,

70
0:04:01.167,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the capital's airport was bombed

71
0:04:03.292,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and Yemen became a no-fly zone.

72
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Now, my parents made this decision before I was born:

73
0:04:12.708,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that I would be born British.

74
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I had nothing to do with the best decision of my life.

75
0:04:21.833,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And now ...

76
0:04:23.292,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Now the lucky ones in my family have escaped,

77
0:04:28.458,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and the others, the others are being been bombed

78
0:04:31.375,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and send you WhatsApp messages that make you detest your very existence.

79
0:04:39.5,000 --> 0:04:41,000
This war's been going on for four years.

80
0:04:42.333,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It's been going on for over four years, and it has led to a humanitarian crisis.

81
0:04:48.625,000 --> 0:04:49,000
There is a famine there,

82
0:04:50.542,000 --> 0:04:52,000
a man-made famine.

83
0:04:52.75,000 --> 0:04:54,000
That's a man-made famine, so not a natural famine,

84
0:04:55.458,000 --> 0:04:58,000
an entirely man-made famine that the UN has warned

85
0:04:59.042,000 --> 0:05:03,000
could be the worst famine the world has seen in a hundred years.

86
0:05:04.417,000 --> 0:05:06,000
This war has made it clear to me more than ever

87
0:05:07.417,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that no place, no people deserve to get left behind.

88
0:05:13.083,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And so I was joining these other teams, and I was forming new collaborations

89
0:05:16.75,000 --> 0:05:18,000
in other unstable places.

90
0:05:18.958,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But I was desperate to get back into Yemen,

91
0:05:22.083,000 --> 0:05:25,000
because for me, Yemen's really personal.

92
0:05:27.083,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And so I kept trying to think of a project I could do in Yemen

93
0:05:32.167,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that would help highlight what was going on there.

94
0:05:35.875,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And every idea I had just kept failing,

95
0:05:39.125,000 --> 0:05:42,000
or it was just too high-risk, because let's be honest,

96
0:05:42.75,000 --> 0:05:45,000
most of Yemen is just too dangerous for a Western team.

97
0:05:47.875,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But then I was told that Socotra, a Yemeni island,

98
0:05:53.583,000 --> 0:05:56,000
was safe once you got there.

99
0:05:56.833,000 --> 0:06:,000
In fact, it turned out there was a few local and international academics

100
0:06:01.125,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that were still working there.

101
0:06:03.417,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And that got me really excited,

102
0:06:06.667,000 --> 0:06:09,000
because look at Socotra's proximity to Africa.

103
0:06:12.125,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And yet we have no idea when humans arrived on that island.

104
0:06:18.75,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But Socotra, for those of you who know it,

105
0:06:21.5,000 --> 0:06:24,000
well, let's just say you probably know it for a completely different reason.

106
0:06:25.125,000 --> 0:06:28,000
You probably know it as the Galapagos of the Indian Ocean,

107
0:06:28.167,000 --> 0:06:32,000
because it is one of the most biodiverse places on this earth.

108
0:06:33.333,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But we were also getting information

109
0:06:35.792,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that this incredibly delicate environment and its people

110
0:06:39.333,000 --> 0:06:4,000
were under threat

111
0:06:40.75,000 --> 0:06:43,000
because they were at the frontline of both Middle Eastern politics

112
0:06:44.542,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and climate change.

113
0:06:46.75,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And it slowly dawned on me that Socotra was my Yemen project.

114
0:06:52.042,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And so I wanted to put together a huge multidisciplinary team.

115
0:06:57.083,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We wanted to cross the archipelago on foot, camel and dhow boat

116
0:07:01.417,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to conduct a health check of this place.

117
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:07,000
This has only been attempted once before, and it was in 1999.

118
0:07:07.875,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But the thing is, that is not an easy thing to pull off.

119
0:07:12.083,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And so we desperately needed a recce,

120
0:07:14.542,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and for those of you who aren't familiar with British English,

121
0:07:17.5,000 --> 0:07:18,000
a recce is like a scouting expedition.

122
0:07:19.375,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It's like a reconnaissance.

123
0:07:20.917,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And I often say that a really big expedition without a recce

124
0:07:27.042,000 --> 0:07:31,000
is a bit like a first date without a Facebook stalk.

125
0:07:31.208,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Laughter)

126
0:07:32.833,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Like, it's doable, but is it wise?

127
0:07:35.25,000 --> 0:07:39,000
(Laughter)

128
0:07:39.833,000 --> 0:07:41,000
There's a few too many knowing laughs in this room.

129
0:07:42.292,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Anyway, so then our recce team thankfully were no strangers to unstable places,

130
0:07:48.833,000 --> 0:07:5,000
which, let's be honest, is kind of important

131
0:07:50.958,000 --> 0:07:53,000
because we were trying to get to a place between Yemen and Somalia,

132
0:07:54.208,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And after calling in what felt like a million favors,

133
0:07:58.917,000 --> 0:08:,000
including to the deputy governor,

134
0:08:01.042,000 --> 0:08:03,000
we finally found ourselves on the move,

135
0:08:05.375,000 --> 0:08:08,000
albeit on a wooden cement cargo ship

136
0:08:08.917,000 --> 0:08:11,000
sailing through pirate waters in the Indian Ocean

137
0:08:12.208,000 --> 0:08:13,000
with this as a toilet.

138
0:08:14.042,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Laughter)

139
0:08:15.5,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Can you guys see this?

140
0:08:19.125,000 --> 0:08:22,000
You know how everybody has their worst toilet story?

141
0:08:23.875,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Well, I've never swam with dolphins before.

142
0:08:28.333,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I just went straight to pooping on them.

143
0:08:30.542,000 --> 0:08:32,000
(Laughter)

144
0:08:35.375,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And also, I genuinely discovered that I am genuinely less stressed

145
0:08:42.125,000 --> 0:08:43,000
by pirate waters

146
0:08:43.75,000 --> 0:08:46,000
than I am with a cockroach infestation

147
0:08:47.332,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that was so intense

148
0:08:49.292,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that at one point I went belowdeck,

149
0:08:51.625,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and the floor was black and it was moving.

150
0:08:54.332,000 --> 0:08:55,000
(Audience moans)

151
0:08:55.792,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Yeah, and at night there was three raised platforms to sleep on,

152
0:09:00.083,000 --> 0:09:03,000
but there was only -- let's say there was four team members,

153
0:09:03.5,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and the thing is, if you got a raised platform to sleep on,

154
0:09:06.333,000 --> 0:09:09,000
you only had to contend with a few cockroaches during the night,

155
0:09:09.625,000 --> 0:09:11,000
whereas if you got the floor, good luck to you.

156
0:09:12.875,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And so I was the only girl in the team and the whole ship,

157
0:09:16.542,000 --> 0:09:19,000
so I got away without sleeping on the floor.

158
0:09:19.583,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And then, on, like, the fourth or fifth night,

159
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Martin Edström looks at me and goes, "Ella, Ella I really believe in equality."

160
0:09:27.167,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Laughter)

161
0:09:31.75,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So we were sailing on that cement cargo ship for three days,

162
0:09:36.833,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and then we slowly started seeing land.

163
0:09:41.458,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And after three years of failing,

164
0:09:44.042,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I was finally seeing Yemen.

165
0:09:46.792,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And there is no feeling on earth like that start of an expedition.

166
0:09:51.542,000 --> 0:09:54,000
It's this moment where you jump out of a jeep

167
0:09:54.792,000 --> 0:09:56,000
or you look up from a boat

168
0:09:57.125,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and you know that there's this possibility,

169
0:09:59.958,000 --> 0:10:01,000
it's small but it's still there,

170
0:10:02.042,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that you're about to find something

171
0:10:04.25,000 --> 0:10:09,000
that could add to or change our knowledge of who we are and where we come from.

172
0:10:09.5,000 --> 0:10:12,000
There is no feeling like it on earth,

173
0:10:12.708,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and it's a feeling that so many scientists have

174
0:10:16.292,000 --> 0:10:2,000
but rarely in politically unstable places.

175
0:10:20.5,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Because Western scientists are discouraged or all-out barred

176
0:10:25.333,000 --> 0:10:27,000
from working in unstable places.

177
0:10:28.875,000 --> 0:10:29,000
But here's the thing:

178
0:10:30.167,000 --> 0:10:33,000
scientists specialize in the jungle.

179
0:10:33.958,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Scientists work in deep cave systems.

180
0:10:37.75,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Scientists attach themselves to rockets and blow themselves into outer space.

181
0:10:42.375,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But apparently, working in an unstable place

182
0:10:44.667,000 --> 0:10:46,000
is deemed too high-risk.

183
0:10:47.083,000 --> 0:10:49,000
It is completely arbitrary.

184
0:10:49.792,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Who here in this room wasn't brought up on adventure stories?

185
0:10:55.167,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And most of our heroes were actually scientists and academics.

186
0:11:00.75,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Science was about going out into the unknown.

187
0:11:03.917,000 --> 0:11:08,000
It was about truly global exploration, even if there were risks.

188
0:11:09.208,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And so when did it become acceptable to make it difficult for science to happen

189
0:11:14.625,000 --> 0:11:15,000
in unstable places?

190
0:11:17.833,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And look, I'm not saying that all scientists should go off

191
0:11:20.792,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and start working in unstable places.

192
0:11:22.625,000 --> 0:11:24,000
This isn't some gung-ho call.

193
0:11:24.708,000 --> 0:11:25,000
But here's the thing:

194
0:11:27.792,000 --> 0:11:31,000
for those who have done the research, understand security protocol

195
0:11:32.917,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and are trained,

196
0:11:34.208,000 --> 0:11:36,000
stop stopping those who want to.

197
0:11:37.083,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Plus,

198
0:11:39.417,000 --> 0:11:43,000
just because one part of a country is an active war zone

199
0:11:43.583,000 --> 0:11:44,000
doesn't mean the whole country is.

200
0:11:45.5,000 --> 0:11:48,000
I'm not saying we should go into active war zones.

201
0:11:48.542,000 --> 0:11:51,000
But Iraqi Kurdistan looks very different from Fallujah.

202
0:11:52.917,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And actually, a few months after I couldn't get into Yemen,

203
0:11:56.958,000 --> 0:11:57,000
another team adopted me.

204
0:11:58.625,000 --> 0:12:02,000
So Professor Graeme Barker's team were actually working in Iraqi Kurdistan,

205
0:12:04.458,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and they were digging up Shanidar Cave.

206
0:12:07.375,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Now, Shanidar Cave a few decades earlier

207
0:12:10.458,000 --> 0:12:14,000
had unveiled a Neanderthal known as Shanidar 1.

208
0:12:16.042,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Now, for a BBC/PBS TV series we actually brought Shanidar 1 to life,

209
0:12:20.417,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and I want you guys to meet Ned, Ned the Neanderthal.

210
0:12:25.625,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Now here's the coolest thing about Ned.

211
0:12:28.25,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Ned, this guy,

212
0:12:30.375,000 --> 0:12:33,000
you're meeting him before his injuries.

213
0:12:33.708,000 --> 0:12:37,000
See, it turned out that Ned was severely disabled.

214
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:42,000
He was in fact so disabled that there is no way he could have survived

215
0:12:42.625,000 --> 0:12:44,000
without the help of other Neanderthals.

216
0:12:45.25,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And so this was proof that,

217
0:12:47.042,000 --> 0:12:5,000
at least for this population of Neanderthals at this time,

218
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Neanderthals were like us,

219
0:12:52.875,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and they sometimes looked after those who couldn't look after themselves.

220
0:12:58.042,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Ned's an Iraqi Neanderthal.

221
0:13:01.333,000 --> 0:13:02,000
So what else are we missing?

222
0:13:03.083,000 --> 0:13:05,000
What incredible scientific discoveries

223
0:13:05.708,000 --> 0:13:07,000
are we not making because we're not looking?

224
0:13:10.042,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And by the way, these places, they deserve narratives of hope,

225
0:13:13.875,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and science and exploration can be a part of that.

226
0:13:17.333,000 --> 0:13:2,000
In fact, I would argue that it can tangibly aid development,

227
0:13:20.667,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and these discoveries become a huge source of local pride.

228
0:13:25.833,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And that brings me to the second reason why science has a geography problem.

229
0:13:31.833,000 --> 0:13:34,000
See, we don't empower local academics, do we?

230
0:13:35.875,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Like, it's not lost on me

231
0:13:37.875,000 --> 0:13:39,000
that in my particular field of paleoanthropology

232
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:43,000
we study human origins,

233
0:13:43.917,000 --> 0:13:46,000
but we have so few diverse scientists.

234
0:13:48.458,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And the thing is, these places are full of students and academics

235
0:13:52.125,000 --> 0:13:54,000
who are desperate to collaborate,

236
0:13:54.542,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and the truth is

237
0:13:56.208,000 --> 0:13:57,000
that for them,

238
0:13:57.958,000 --> 0:13:59,000
they have fewer security issues than us.

239
0:14:02.458,000 --> 0:14:05,000
I think we constantly forget that for them it's not a hostile environment;

240
0:14:06.375,000 --> 0:14:07,000
for them it's home.

241
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:11,000
I'm telling you,

242
0:14:11.083,000 --> 0:14:15,000
research done in unstable places with local collaborators

243
0:14:15.583,000 --> 0:14:18,000
can lead to incredible discoveries,

244
0:14:18.958,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and that is what we are hoping upon hope to do in Socotra.

245
0:14:24.875,000 --> 0:14:25,000
They call Socotra

246
0:14:27.333,000 --> 0:14:3,000
the most alien-looking place on earth,

247
0:14:30.375,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and myself, Leon McCarron, Martin Edström and Rhys Thwaites-Jones could see why.

248
0:14:36.042,000 --> 0:14:37,000
I mean, look at this place.

249
0:14:37.75,000 --> 0:14:4,000
These places, they're not hellholes, they're not write-offs,

250
0:14:41.042,000 --> 0:14:44,000
they're the future frontline of science and exploration.

251
0:14:46.042,000 --> 0:14:48,000
90 percent of the reptiles on this island,

252
0:14:49.708,000 --> 0:14:54,000
37 percent of the plant species exist here and nowhere else on earth,

253
0:14:55.333,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and that includes this species of dragon's blood tree,

254
0:14:57.917,000 --> 0:14:59,000
which actually bleeds this red resin.

255
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And there's something else.

256
0:15:02.75,000 --> 0:15:06,000
People on Socotra, some of them still live in caves,

257
0:15:07.542,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and that is really exciting,

258
0:15:09.25,000 --> 0:15:12,000
because it means if a cave is prime real estate this century,

259
0:15:12.333,000 --> 0:15:14,000
maybe it was a few thousand years ago.

260
0:15:14.625,000 --> 0:15:17,000
But we need the data to prove it, the fossils, the stone tools,

261
0:15:18.583,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and so our scouting team have teamed up with other scientists,

262
0:15:22.125,000 --> 0:15:24,000
anthropologists and storytellers,

263
0:15:24.417,000 --> 0:15:27,000
international as well as local, like Ahmed Alarqbi,

264
0:15:27.75,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and we are desperate to shed a light on this place

265
0:15:30.958,000 --> 0:15:31,000
before it's too late.

266
0:15:34.667,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And now, now we just somehow need to get back

267
0:15:38.125,000 --> 0:15:4,000
for that really big expedition,

268
0:15:40.458,000 --> 0:15:41,000
because science,

269
0:15:42.167,000 --> 0:15:44,000
science has a geography problem.

270
0:15:45.625,000 --> 0:15:47,000
You guys have been a really lovely audience.

271
0:15:47.75,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Thank you.

272
0:15:49.042,000 --> 0:15:52,000
(Applause)

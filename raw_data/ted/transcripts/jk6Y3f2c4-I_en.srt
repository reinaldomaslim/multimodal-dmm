2
0:00:16.54,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Tiffany Kagure Mugo: OK.

3
0:00:17.715,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So we've signed up, there's no turning back now.

4
0:00:20.087,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:21.112,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Siphumeze Khundayi: Hi, guys. TKM: Hello, everyone.

6
0:00:23.629,000 --> 0:00:25,000
TKM: So, you think you know about sex.

7
0:00:26.462,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Chances are you don't,

8
0:00:28.074,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and we are here to tell you that you don't.

9
0:00:30.791,000 --> 0:00:33,000
SK: We are here to tell you that no matter where you come from,

10
0:00:34.292,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Abuja to Alabama, Dubai to downtown London,

11
0:00:37.967,000 --> 0:00:39,000
sex has and continues to change.

12
0:00:40.109,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And we need to understand this

13
0:00:41.8,000 --> 0:00:43,000
if we're going to keep things safe and spicy.

14
0:00:44.426,000 --> 0:00:46,000
TKM: So now, the act of rubbing our naked bodies together

15
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
has undergone a number of changes.

16
0:00:49.696,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And those changes have been affected by eons of ideas.

17
0:00:53.49,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Even you, as an adult, have some internalized ideas about sex

18
0:00:57.108,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that you never challenge.

19
0:00:58.8,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Some good, some bad and some very, very strange.

20
0:01:02.514,000 --> 0:01:03,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:04.427,000 --> 0:01:06,000
SK: So when you allow someone to see you butt naked,

22
0:01:06.88,000 --> 0:01:1,000
do you ever think about how the ideas that you internally have

23
0:01:11.006,000 --> 0:01:15,000
will affect whether you will like them tickling your elbow or kissing your thigh

24
0:01:15.253,000 --> 0:01:17,000
or shouting out the name of a chose deity?

25
0:01:17.921,000 --> 0:01:19,000
One must do internal monitoring and evaluation

26
0:01:20.874,000 --> 0:01:23,000
if we are going to live our best sexy lives.

27
0:01:24.034,000 --> 0:01:27,000
TKM: And we're going to tell you how to have a great sex life, right?

28
0:01:27.321,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But the first thing you need to do

29
0:01:28.98,000 --> 0:01:31,000
is let go of the bad ideas you have about sex.

30
0:01:32.846,000 --> 0:01:34,000
SK: Think about the things that we need to change.

31
0:01:35.316,000 --> 0:01:38,000
TKM: And the things we need to embrace in all of their shiny newness.

32
0:01:38.999,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So, we're going to take you on a journey of sex:

33
0:01:41.652,000 --> 0:01:45,000
the bad parts of sex, historically great sexual practices

34
0:01:45.954,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and the future of sex.

35
0:01:48.411,000 --> 0:01:53,000
SK: Now, judging by the cool seven billion people on this planet,

36
0:01:53.529,000 --> 0:01:56,000
human beings have been doing the sex thing for a long time.

37
0:01:56.933,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And in vast quantities.

38
0:01:58.737,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But this does not mean we are actually good at it.

39
0:02:02.236,000 --> 0:02:04,000
From the top of my head -- rape culture.

40
0:02:05.64,000 --> 0:02:08,000
TKM: How tradition and culture limit ideas of pleasure.

41
0:02:09.482,000 --> 0:02:1,000
SK: Or even the idea that the nipple

42
0:02:11.245,000 --> 0:02:14,000
deserves the same treatment that a DJ gives his deck

43
0:02:14.569,000 --> 0:02:16,000
when he's trying to turn up the volume.

44
0:02:16.942,000 --> 0:02:18,000
TKM: Like, that is a personal pet peeve of mine.

45
0:02:19.68,000 --> 0:02:23,000
SK: We are so scared of sex.

46
0:02:24.49,000 --> 0:02:27,000
TKM: And we need somebody to blame for our fear.

47
0:02:28.616,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Enter women, and our fear of every part of their anatomy,

48
0:02:32.558,000 --> 0:02:34,000
unless we are the ones using their sexiness.

49
0:02:35.006,000 --> 0:02:36,000
SK: Think about it.

50
0:02:36.228,000 --> 0:02:39,000
You can quite easily go to someone and say, "My elbow hurts."

51
0:02:39.736,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But try going to someone and saying,

52
0:02:41.657,000 --> 0:02:44,000
"Excuse me, my vagina has a strange buzzing feeling,

53
0:02:44.871,000 --> 0:02:46,000
do you know where I can find the buzzing-vagina ointment?"

54
0:02:47.744,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And see how well that goes down.

55
0:02:50.089,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:51.815,000 --> 0:02:52,000
TKM: Does not go down well.

57
0:02:53.133,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I once challenged friends to simply go into supermarkets

58
0:02:56.618,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and say to strangers, "Thighs."

59
0:02:59.323,000 --> 0:03:,000
No one did it,

60
0:03:00.489,000 --> 0:03:03,000
despite the fact that they could have been talking about chicken or turkey.

61
0:03:04.077,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:05.139,000 --> 0:03:07,000
SK: So a number of cultural and historical notions

63
0:03:07.896,000 --> 0:03:09,000
have burrowed so deeply within us,

64
0:03:10.062,000 --> 0:03:14,000
we don't even notice that it's strange to freak out when somebody says "nipple"

65
0:03:14.133,000 --> 0:03:15,000
as opposed to "left knee."

66
0:03:15.696,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We refuse to engage with sex properly.

67
0:03:18.49,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And the first step is admitting that it exists

68
0:03:21.355,000 --> 0:03:25,000
outside of trying to sell us products like bottled water or coffee.

69
0:03:25.879,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The unrealistic depictions in movies

70
0:03:28.143,000 --> 0:03:31,000
or that one thing that you saw on the internet "by mistake."

71
0:03:31.863,000 --> 0:03:32,000
TKM: Mhm.

72
0:03:33.053,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So, now in order to cure this ailment, again,

73
0:03:36.018,000 --> 0:03:4,000
let us just first admit that we have some messed-up ideas of sex.

74
0:03:40.403,000 --> 0:03:41,000
SK: And breathe in --

75
0:03:41.744,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Inhales)

76
0:03:43.03,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And let it all go.

77
0:03:46.432,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Now, it all seems pretty morbid --

78
0:03:49.463,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that culture and society have failed us in our quest for coitus.

79
0:03:54.281,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But this is not the case.

80
0:03:55.646,000 --> 0:03:57,000
There are things that the past can teach us

81
0:03:57.689,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to help us upgrade the present.

82
0:04:00.007,000 --> 0:04:04,000
TKM: So now, if I had a glass of Merlot -- which I really wish I did --

83
0:04:04.309,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I would pour the ancestors a drink,

84
0:04:06.312,000 --> 0:04:08,000
because there are ways in which African societies

85
0:04:09.153,000 --> 0:04:11,000
huddled this sex thing before the C that shall not be named --

86
0:04:12.169,000 --> 0:04:13,000
SK: (Whispering) Colonization.

87
0:04:13.661,000 --> 0:04:14,000
TKM: Came through.

88
0:04:14.9,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Within African societies, we had spaces, both social and spiritual,

89
0:04:19.932,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that helped institutionalize healthy sexual practices.

90
0:04:23.673,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We had sexuality schools that taught social and erotic cues.

91
0:04:28.386,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We had spaces where teenagers could engage, understand

92
0:04:31.744,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and like, properly know how to handle sexual urges,

93
0:04:35.601,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and places where adults could handle the stresses and strifes of adulting.

94
0:04:40.625,000 --> 0:04:42,000
SK: Ways that didn't include you hiding your credit card bill

95
0:04:43.528,000 --> 0:04:45,000
or deleting that toll-free number from your phone.

96
0:04:45.887,000 --> 0:04:48,000
These spaces of old were so important for women.

97
0:04:49.529,000 --> 0:04:51,000
TKM: There were African sexual practices that centered women

98
0:04:52.403,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and in particular, their pleasure.

99
0:04:54.506,000 --> 0:04:56,000
SK: And we're going to talk about one in particular

100
0:04:56.974,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that's named "osunality."

101
0:04:58.871,000 --> 0:05:,000
TKM: Also known as the African erotic.

102
0:05:01.61,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Yes, my people, welcome to the Thunderdome.

103
0:05:04.712,000 --> 0:05:06,000
The erotic takes on different shapes and forms

104
0:05:07.094,000 --> 0:05:09,000
as you travel the globe.

105
0:05:09.204,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Now let's take a bow to the "Kama Sutra,"

106
0:05:11.204,000 --> 0:05:15,000
the world's first book on the pleasures of sensual living.

107
0:05:15.625,000 --> 0:05:19,000
More than just a mere depiction of contortionist sexual positions,

108
0:05:20.18,000 --> 0:05:24,000
it provided a comprehensive guide on living a good life.

109
0:05:24.442,000 --> 0:05:26,000
What is particularly interesting for us

110
0:05:26.727,000 --> 0:05:3,000
is that it focused on women and creating pleasure for women.

111
0:05:31.323,000 --> 0:05:35,000
TKM: Mhm. Shout-out to the "Kama Sutra," but back to the African erotic.

112
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
SK: OK, my bad, bringing it back.

113
0:05:38.68,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So, Nkiru Nzegwu says that Osun, who is an orisha of the Yoruba people,

114
0:05:43.632,000 --> 0:05:45,000
typically associated with water,

115
0:05:45.879,000 --> 0:05:49,000
purity, fertility, love and, most importantly, sensuality,

116
0:05:50.529,000 --> 0:05:55,000
represents a female-centered life-transforming energy

117
0:05:55.672,000 --> 0:05:57,000
that courses through and animates life.

118
0:05:58.617,000 --> 0:06:,000
She says that women who typify the osun force

119
0:06:01.276,000 --> 0:06:05,000
brandish their sexuality quite openly and unselfconsciously.

120
0:06:06.228,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And she goes on to say ...

121
0:06:07.521,000 --> 0:06:09,000
TKM: There you go, you got that line this time.

122
0:06:10.157,000 --> 0:06:12,000
"The flow need not result in conception and birth

123
0:06:13.029,000 --> 0:06:17,000
but doesn't tell the principle of pleasure at the heart of copulation.

124
0:06:17.446,000 --> 0:06:2,000
This pleasure principle at the heart of the creative energy

125
0:06:20.787,000 --> 0:06:23,000
is metaphorically known as 'osun honey'."

126
0:06:23.914,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Sorry, I did not want to misquote that.

127
0:06:25.907,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So now, osun honey and osunality

128
0:06:28.422,000 --> 0:06:31,000
re-affirm the normality of sexual pleasure and the erotic.

129
0:06:32.831,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Osun, like other female deities of fertility across Africa,

130
0:06:37.799,000 --> 0:06:41,000
made sure and emphasized the importance of female sexuality

131
0:06:42.371,000 --> 0:06:44,000
without negating male sexuality.

132
0:06:45.18,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We had the Tonga, the Bemba, the Sande

133
0:06:48.093,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and other similar sexuality schools of thought

134
0:06:51.117,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that taught young women about the power of this inner force.

135
0:06:55.156,000 --> 0:06:56,000
TKM: So within the African continent,

136
0:06:56.951,000 --> 0:06:59,000
there's a great deal of talk about the synergic nature of sex

137
0:07:00.465,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and how it comes together as a social good.

138
0:07:02.982,000 --> 0:07:04,000
For example, within Rwanda,

139
0:07:05.061,000 --> 0:07:07,000
there is the notion that the rivers are replenished

140
0:07:07.962,000 --> 0:07:09,000
by the act of a woman squirting.

141
0:07:10.724,000 --> 0:07:11,000
(Laughter)

142
0:07:12.077,000 --> 0:07:16,000
SK: But modern-day ideas of sex have become some sort of battle

143
0:07:16.871,000 --> 0:07:18,000
in which we are all trying to subvert each other.

144
0:07:20.735,000 --> 0:07:24,000
TKM: We are pounding the pussy, using sex as a weapon,

145
0:07:25.021,000 --> 0:07:27,000
playing hard to get, conquering --

146
0:07:27.219,000 --> 0:07:29,000
a constant power struggle.

147
0:07:30.03,000 --> 0:07:33,000
SK: And there is always a loser when it comes to this war.

148
0:07:34.3,000 --> 0:07:39,000
TKM: So now the ability to openly brandish and explore your sexuality and your sex

149
0:07:40.132,000 --> 0:07:42,000
without it being a threat to others

150
0:07:42.288,000 --> 0:07:45,000
is at the core of engaging with healthy sexual practices.

151
0:07:46.236,000 --> 0:07:5,000
SK: Now this is where it begins to get really, really good.

152
0:07:51.046,000 --> 0:07:52,000
TKM: So what does it mean

153
0:07:53.022,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to reconceptualize sex away from this idea of the monster hiding in the night?

154
0:07:58.306,000 --> 0:08:,000
What is the potential for doing greatness

155
0:08:00.435,000 --> 0:08:03,000
on the kitchen counter, a secluded beach, the backseat of a car

156
0:08:04.132,000 --> 0:08:06,000
or even simply in between the sheets?

157
0:08:06.75,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Now in learning from the past and sliding into the present,

158
0:08:10.433,000 --> 0:08:12,000
a radical theory of sex

159
0:08:12.552,000 --> 0:08:17,000
must identify, it must describe, explain and denounce

160
0:08:17.776,000 --> 0:08:19,000
sexual oppression and erotic injustice.

161
0:08:20.585,000 --> 0:08:22,000
TKM: And sex positivity is one of the realms

162
0:08:22.736,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in which the new can be unpacked and explored.

163
0:08:25.491,000 --> 0:08:27,000
SK: We're asking you to call upon the osun honey

164
0:08:28.205,000 --> 0:08:31,000
to engage with new ideas of sex and pleasure

165
0:08:32.212,000 --> 0:08:35,000
so that we can start to build a new identity

166
0:08:35.553,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that feels more like a fitted dress

167
0:08:37.641,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and less like a wooden coffin slowly choking the life out of us.

168
0:08:42.673,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Now there are a lot of people charting their own sexual paths.

169
0:08:46.363,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But, because as HOLAAfrica --

170
0:08:48.265,000 --> 0:08:5,000
SK: We do sex and sexuality online --

171
0:08:50.998,000 --> 0:08:53,000
TKM: We would be foolhardy not to mention the digital realm.

172
0:08:54.775,000 --> 0:08:58,000
There are women who are online, creating incredible conversations,

173
0:08:59.593,000 --> 0:09:01,000
chatting about the clitoris,

174
0:09:02.284,000 --> 0:09:04,000
chatting about the reverse cowgirl and also cunnilingus.

175
0:09:05.553,000 --> 0:09:06,000
SK: I like the word "cunnilingus."

176
0:09:07.22,000 --> 0:09:09,000
TKM: I bet you do. But that's not the point.

177
0:09:09.339,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Anyway, these women are resurrecting the work of ancestors

178
0:09:13.522,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to have some incredible conversations

179
0:09:15.887,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that have been previously buried and sealed.

180
0:09:18.752,000 --> 0:09:22,000
SK: They are asking the questions that we are so afraid to ask,

181
0:09:23.363,000 --> 0:09:25,000
so that we don't end up in sticky situations.

182
0:09:25.728,000 --> 0:09:26,000
TKM: That's true.

183
0:09:26.903,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And another space that we've been seeing the charting of a new sexual path

184
0:09:30.807,000 --> 0:09:33,000
is by queer women and their engagement in kink.

185
0:09:35.292,000 --> 0:09:37,000
SK: Now, think "Fifty Shades of Grey"

186
0:09:37.9,000 --> 0:09:41,000
without the creepy rich guy who does not understand consent.

187
0:09:42.585,000 --> 0:09:43,000
(Laughter)

188
0:09:43.998,000 --> 0:09:47,000
TKM: So one fascinating subset of kink is actually rope play.

189
0:09:48.759,000 --> 0:09:52,000
SK: Shibari, also known as Kinbaku, is the Japanese art of rope play.

190
0:09:52.982,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Originally used as a means of restraining captives,

191
0:09:57.767,000 --> 0:09:59,000
it became sexualized and spreading across the globe

192
0:10:00.745,000 --> 0:10:04,000
as a kinky form of restraint with a respected and erotic aesthetic.

193
0:10:05.399,000 --> 0:10:06,000
TKM: And it landed on our shores.

194
0:10:07.72,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Who would have thought that African queer women would be kinksters?

195
0:10:11.378,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Coming from a history of sexual violence, slavery and a lack of bodily autonomy.

196
0:10:16.831,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Is it not too soon, you ask.

197
0:10:18.498,000 --> 0:10:19,000
SK: No, it's not,

198
0:10:19.672,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and these women have taught us that despite the dark history

199
0:10:23.022,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that covers the body of women from our beautiful continent,

200
0:10:26.268,000 --> 0:10:29,000
these women are actively and beautifully constructing

201
0:10:29.642,000 --> 0:10:31,000
what sex and pleasure means to them.

202
0:10:32.157,000 --> 0:10:37,000
TKM: This is not to say that everyone now needs to rush out and engage in kink.

203
0:10:37.585,000 --> 0:10:4,000
But if these queer women can come out of a history

204
0:10:40.617,000 --> 0:10:44,000
of, again, sexual violence, slavery, colonization

205
0:10:44.704,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and all manner of traditional, religious and cultural pitfalls,

206
0:10:48.839,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to reconceptualize what sex and pleasure means to them,

207
0:10:52.45,000 --> 0:10:53,000
then you can do it, too.

208
0:10:53.649,000 --> 0:10:55,000
SK: You can do it too, boo-boo.

209
0:10:56.377,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Yes, you can.

210
0:10:57.558,000 --> 0:10:58,000
(Laughter)

211
0:10:58.744,000 --> 0:11:01,000
TKM: It is in taking the ideas that we have about sex -- the bad ones,

212
0:11:02.092,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and head-butting them,

213
0:11:03.45,000 --> 0:11:06,000
holding on to the good ones and creating new ones

214
0:11:06.744,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that we can have an incredible engagement

215
0:11:09.401,000 --> 0:11:13,000
with one of the most prolific and natural human acts ever.

216
0:11:13.625,000 --> 0:11:16,000
SK: It's about figuring out what counts as a system bug.

217
0:11:16.99,000 --> 0:11:17,000
TKM: What to term a classic.

218
0:11:18.758,000 --> 0:11:2,000
SK: And what new features we should add.

219
0:11:20.934,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Human beings are infamous for their superpower to upgrade.

220
0:11:24.408,000 --> 0:11:26,000
This should count for our sex, too.

221
0:11:27.448,000 --> 0:11:28,000
TKM: Thank you.

222
0:11:29.048,000 --> 0:11:36,000
(Applause)

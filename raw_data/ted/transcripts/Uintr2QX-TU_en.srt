1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Chris Anderson: Let's now see the extraordinary speech

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that we captured a couple weeks ago.

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Music)

4
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Jose Antonio Abreu: My dear friends, ladies and gentlemen,

5
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I am overjoyed today

6
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
at being awarded the TED Prize

7
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
on behalf of all

8
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
the distinguished music teachers,

9
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
artists and educators from Venezuela

10
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
who have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for 35 years

11
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in founding, growing and developing in Venezuela

12
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
the National System of Youth and Children's Orchestras and Choirs.

13
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Since I was a boy,

14
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
in my early childhood,

15
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I always wanted to be a musician,

16
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and, thank God, I made it.

17
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
From my teachers, my family and my community,

18
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I had all the necessary support to become a musician.

19
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
All my life I've dreamed

20
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that all Venezuelan children

21
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
have the same opportunity that I had.

22
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
From that desire and from my heart

23
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
stemmed the idea to make music

24
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
a deep and global reality for my country.

25
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
From the very first rehearsal, I saw the bright future ahead.

26
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Because the rehearsal meant a great challenge to me.

27
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I had received a donation of 50 music stands

28
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
to be used by 100 boys in that rehearsal.

29
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
When I arrived at the rehearsal, only 11 kids had shown up,

30
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and I said to myself,

31
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
"Do I close the program or multiply these kids?"

32
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I decided to face the challenge, and on that same night,

33
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I promised those 11 children I'd turn our orchestra

34
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
into one of the leading orchestras in the world.

35
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Two months ago, I remembered that promise I made,

36
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
when a distinguished English critic

37
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
published an article in the London Times,

38
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
asking who could be the winner of the Orchestra World Cup.

39
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
He mentioned four great world orchestras,

40
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and the fifth one was Venezuela's Youth Symphony Orchestra.

41
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Today we can say

42
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that art in Latin America

43
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
is no longer a monopoly of elites

44
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and that it has become a social right,

45
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
a right for all the people.

46
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Child: There is no difference here between classes,

47
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
nor white or black, nor if you have money or not.

48
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Simply, if you are talented,

49
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
if you have the vocation and the will to be here,

50
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
you get in. You share with us and make music.

51
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
JA: During the recent tour

52
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
by the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela

53
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
of U.S. and Europe,

54
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
we saw how our music moved young audiences

55
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to the bottom of their souls,

56
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
how children and adolescents rushed up to the stage

57
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to receive the jackets from our musicians,

58
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
how the standing ovations, sometimes 30 minutes long,

59
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
seemed to last forever,

60
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and how the public, after the concert was over,

61
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
went out into the street to greet our young people in triumph.

62
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
This meant not only an artistic triumph,

63
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
but also a profound emotional sympathy

64
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
between the public of the most advanced nations of the world

65
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and the musical youth of Latin America,

66
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
as seen in Venezuela,

67
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
giving these audiences a message of music, vitality, energy,

68
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
enthusiasm and strength.

69
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
In its essence, the orchestra and the choir

70
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
are much more than artistic structures.

71
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
They are examples and schools of social life,

72
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
because to sing and to play together

73
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
means to intimately coexist

74
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
toward perfection and excellence,

75
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
following a strict discipline of organization and coordination

76
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
in order to seek the harmonic interdependence

77
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
of voices and instruments.

78
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
That's how they build a spirit of solidarity

79
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and fraternity among them,

80
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
develop their self-esteem

81
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and foster the ethical and aesthetical values

82
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
related to the music in all its senses.

83
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
This is why music is immensely important

84
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
in the awakening of sensibility, in the forging of values

85
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and in the training of youngsters

86
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to teach other kids.

87
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Child: After all this time here,

88
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
music is life.

89
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Nothing else.

90
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Music is life.

91
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
JA: Each teenager and child in El Sistema has his own story,

92
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and they are all important and of great significance to me.

93
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Let me mention the case of Edicson Ruiz.

94
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
He is a boy from a parish in Caracas

95
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
who passionately attended to his double bass lessons

96
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
at the San Agustin's Junior Orchestra.

97
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
With his effort,

98
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and the support of his mother, his family and his community,

99
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
he became a principal member

100
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
in the double bass segment of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.

101
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
We have another well-known case -- Gustavo Dudamel.

102
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
He started as a boy member of the children's orchestra

103
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
in his hometown, Barquisimeto.

104
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
There, he grew as a violinist and as a conductor.

105
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
He became the conductor of Venezuela's junior orchestras,

106
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and today conducts the world's greatest orchestras.

107
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
He is the musical director of Los Angeles Philharmonic,

108
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and is still the overall leader of Venezuela's junior orchestras.

109
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
He was the conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra,

110
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and he's an unbeatable example

111
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
for young musicians in Latin America and the world.

112
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The structure of El Sistema

113
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
is based on a new and flexible managing style

114
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
adapted to the features of each community and region,

115
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and today attends to 300,000 children of the lower and middle class

116
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
all over Venezuela.

117
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It's a program of social rescue

118
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and deep cultural transformation

119
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
designed for the whole Venezuelan society

120
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
with absolutely no distinctions whatsoever,

121
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
but emphasizing the vulnerable and endangered social groups.

122
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
The effect of El Sistema is felt in three fundamental circles:

123
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
in the personal/social circle,

124
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
in the family circle and in the community.

125
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
In the personal/social circle,

126
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
the children in the orchestras and choirs

127
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
develop their intellectual and emotional side.

128
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
The music becomes a source

129
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
for developing the dimensions of the human being,

130
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
thus elevating the spirit

131
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and leading man to a full development of his personality.

132
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So, the emotional and intellectual profits are huge --

133
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
the acquisition of leadership, teaching and training principles,

134
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
the sense of commitment, responsibility,

135
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
generosity and dedication to others,

136
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals.

137
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
All this leads to the development of self-esteem and confidence.

138
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Mother Teresa of Calcutta

139
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
insisted on something that always impressed me:

140
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
the most miserable and tragic thing about poverty

141
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
is not the lack of bread or roof,

142
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
but the feeling of being no-one --

143
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
the feeling of not being anyone,

144
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
the lack of identification,

145
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
the lack of public esteem.

146
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
That's why the child's development

147
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
in the orchestra and the choir

148
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
provides him with a noble identity

149
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and makes him a role model for his family and community.

150
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It makes him a better student at school

151
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
because it inspires in him a sense of responsibility,

152
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
perseverance and punctuality that will greatly help him at school.

153
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Within the family, the parents' support is unconditional.

154
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
The child becomes a role model for both his parents,

155
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and this is very important for a poor child.

156
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Once the child discovers he is important to his family,

157
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
he begins to seek new ways of improving himself

158
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and hopes better for himself and his community.

159
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Also, he hopes for social and economic improvements for his own family.

160
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
All this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic.

161
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
The large majority of our children belong, as I already mentioned,

162
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
to the most vulnerable strata of the Venezuelan population.

163
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
That encourages them to embrace new dreams, new goals,

164
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and progress in the various opportunities

165
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that music has to offer.

166
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Finally, in the circle of the community,

167
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
the orchestras prove to be the creative spaces of culture

168
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and sources of exchange and new meanings.

169
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
The spontaneity music has

170
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
excludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society.

171
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
It's what makes a child play a violin at home,

172
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
while his father works in his carpentry.

173
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
It's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home,

174
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
while her mother does the housework.

175
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
The idea is that the families join with pride and joy

176
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
in the activities of the orchestras and the choirs

177
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
that their children belong to.

178
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
The huge spiritual world that music produces in itself,

179
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
which also lies within itself,

180
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
ends up overcoming material poverty.

181
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
From the minute a child's taught how to play an instrument,

182
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
he's no longer poor.

183
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
He becomes a child in progress heading for a professional level,

184
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
who'll later become a full citizen.

185
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Needless to say that music is the number one prevention

186
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
against prostitution, violence, bad habits,

187
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and everything degrading in the life of a child.

188
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
A few years ago, historian Arnold Toynbee

189
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
said that the world was suffering a huge spiritual crisis.

190
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Not an economic or social crisis, but a spiritual one.

191
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
I believe that to confront such a crisis,

192
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
only art and religion can give proper answers to humanity,

193
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
to mankind's deepest aspirations,

194
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and to the historic demands of our times.

195
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Education -- the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge --

196
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
is the means to strive for a more perfect, more aware,

197
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
more noble and more just society.

198
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
With passion and enthusiasm we pay profound respects to TED

199
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
for its outstanding humanism, the scope of its principles,

200
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
for its open and generous promotion of young values.

201
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
We hope that TED can contribute in a full and fundamental way

202
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
to the building of this new era in the teaching of music,

203
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
in which the social, communal, spiritual and vindicatory aims

204
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
of the child and the adolescent

205
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
become a beacon and a goal for a vast social mission.

206
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
No longer putting society at the service of art,

207
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and much less at the services of monopolies of the elite,

208
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
but instead art at the service of society,

209
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
at the service of the weakest, at the service of the children,

210
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
at the service of the sick, at the service of the vulnerable,

211
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and at the service of all those who cry for vindication

212
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
through the spirit of their human condition

213
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and the raising up of their dignity.

214
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000

CA: We are going live now to Caracas.

217
0:16:00.33,000 --> 0:16:02,000
We are going live to Caracas

218
0:16:02.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
to hear Maestro Abreu's TED Prize wish.

219
0:16:06.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
JA: Here is my TED Prize wish:

220
0:16:10.33,000 --> 0:16:15,000
I wish that you'll help to create and document

221
0:16:15.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
a special training program

222
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
for 50 gifted young musicians,

223
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:27,000
passionate about their art and social justice,

224
0:16:27.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and dedicated to bringing El Sistema to the United States

225
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and other countries.

226
0:16:35.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Thank you very much.

227
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:49,000

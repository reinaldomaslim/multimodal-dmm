1
0:00:16.236,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Khan Academy is most known for its collection of videos,

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
so before I go any further,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
let me show you a little bit of a montage.

4
0:00:24.623,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Video) Salman Khan: So the hypotenuse is now going to be five.

5
0:00:27.719,000 --> 0:00:3,000
This animal's fossils are only found in this area of South America --

6
0:00:31.036,000 --> 0:00:32,000
a nice clean band here --

7
0:00:32.64,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and this part of Africa.

8
0:00:34.853,000 --> 0:00:36,000
We can integrate over the surface,

9
0:00:37.043,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and the notation usually is a capital sigma.

10
0:00:39.908,000 --> 0:00:42,000
National Assembly: They create the Committee of Public Safety,

11
0:00:43.098,000 --> 0:00:44,000
which sounds like a very nice committee.

12
0:00:45.083,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Notice, this is an aldehyde, and it's an alcohol.

13
0:00:48.812,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Start differentiating into effector and memory cells.

14
0:00:52.081,000 --> 0:00:55,000
A galaxy. Hey! There's another galaxy. Oh, look! There's another galaxy.

15
0:00:55.825,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And for dollars, is their 30 million,

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
plus the 20 million dollars from the American manufacturer.

17
0:01:01.323,000 --> 0:01:04,000
If this does not blow your mind,

18
0:01:04.847,000 --> 0:01:06,000
then you have no emotion.

19
0:01:06.878,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Applause)

21
0:01:13.799,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Live) SK: We now have on the order of 2,200 videos,

22
0:01:17.804,000 --> 0:01:21,000
covering everything from basic arithmetic, all the way to vector calculus,

23
0:01:22.019,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and some of the stuff that you saw up there.

24
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
We have a million students a month using the site,

25
0:01:27.688,000 --> 0:01:3,000
watching on the order of 100 to 200,000 videos a day.

26
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
But what we're going to talk about in this is how we're going to the next level.

27
0:01:35.934,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But before I do that,

28
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I want to talk a little bit about really just how I got started.

29
0:01:41.18,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And some of you all might know,

30
0:01:43.505,000 --> 0:01:46,000
about five years ago, I was an analyst at a hedge fund,

31
0:01:46.55,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and I was in Boston,

32
0:01:49.042,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and I was tutoring my cousins in New Orleans, remotely.

33
0:01:52.154,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And I started putting the first YouTube videos up,

34
0:01:54.519,000 --> 0:01:55,000
really just as a kind of nice-to-have,

35
0:01:56.377,000 --> 0:01:58,000
just kind of a supplement for my cousins,

36
0:01:58.526,000 --> 0:02:01,000
something that might give them a refresher or something.

37
0:02:01.558,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And as soon as I put those first YouTube videos up,

38
0:02:04.222,000 --> 0:02:05,000
something interesting happened.

39
0:02:05.75,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Actually, a bunch of interesting things happened.

40
0:02:08.118,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The first was the feedback from my cousins.

41
0:02:10.967,000 --> 0:02:14,000
They told me that they preferred me on YouTube than in person.

42
0:02:15.732,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:22.733,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And once you get over the backhanded nature of that,

44
0:02:27.047,000 --> 0:02:29,000
there was actually something very profound there.

45
0:02:29.379,000 --> 0:02:32,000
They were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin

46
0:02:33.229,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to their cousin.

47
0:02:34.84,000 --> 0:02:35,000
At first it's very unintuitive,

48
0:02:36.353,000 --> 0:02:39,000
but when you think about it from their point of view, it makes a ton of sense.

49
0:02:40.135,000 --> 0:02:43,000
You have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin,

50
0:02:43.979,000 --> 0:02:46,000
without feeling like they're wasting my time.

51
0:02:47.027,000 --> 0:02:49,000
If they have to review something

52
0:02:49.423,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago,

53
0:02:52.002,000 --> 0:02:54,000
or maybe a couple of years ago,

54
0:02:54.248,000 --> 0:02:56,000
they don't have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin.

55
0:02:56.93,000 --> 0:02:59,000
They can just watch those videos; if they're bored, they can go ahead.

56
0:03:00.296,000 --> 0:03:02,000
They can watch at their own time and pace.

57
0:03:02.344,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Probably the least-appreciated aspect of this

58
0:03:07.169,000 --> 0:03:09,000
is the notion that the very first time

59
0:03:09.764,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that you're trying to get your brain around a new concept,

60
0:03:13.636,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the very last thing you need

61
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
is another human being saying, "Do you understand this?"

62
0:03:18.454,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And that's what was happening

63
0:03:19.872,000 --> 0:03:21,000
with the interaction with my cousins before,

64
0:03:21.991,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and now they can just do it in the intimacy of their own room.

65
0:03:28.573,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The other thing that happened is --

66
0:03:30.294,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I put them on YouTube just --

67
0:03:33.811,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I saw no reason to make it private,

68
0:03:35.634,000 --> 0:03:36,000
so I let other people watch it,

69
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and then people started stumbling on it,

70
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and I started getting some comments and some letters

71
0:03:42.782,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and all sorts of feedback

72
0:03:45.012,000 --> 0:03:46,000
from random people around the world.

73
0:03:46.972,000 --> 0:03:47,000
These are just a few.

74
0:03:49.922,000 --> 0:03:52,000
This is actually from one of the original calculus videos.

75
0:03:53.44,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Someone wrote it on YouTube, it was a YouTube comment:

76
0:03:56.545,000 --> 0:03:58,000
"First time I smiled doing a derivative."

77
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

78
0:04:02.18,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Let's pause here.

79
0:04:04.006,000 --> 0:04:05,000
This person did a derivative,

80
0:04:05.982,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and then they smiled.

81
0:04:07.183,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:08.988,000 --> 0:04:09,000
In response to that same comment --

83
0:04:10.695,000 --> 0:04:13,000
this is on the thread, you can go on YouTube and look at the comments --

84
0:04:14.17,000 --> 0:04:15,000
someone else wrote: "Same thing here.

85
0:04:15.972,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day,

86
0:04:19.069,000 --> 0:04:23,000
since I remember seeing all of this matrix text in class,

87
0:04:23.521,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and here I'm all like, 'I know kung fu.'"

88
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:30.545,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We get a lot of feedback along those lines.

90
0:04:32.92,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This clearly was helping people.

91
0:04:34.625,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But then, as the viewership kept growing and kept growing,

92
0:04:38.351,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I started getting letters from people,

93
0:04:40.946,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and it was starting to become clear

94
0:04:42.707,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that it was more than just a nice-to-have.

95
0:04:44.813,000 --> 0:04:47,000
This is just an excerpt from one of those letters:

96
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
"My 12 year-old son has autism,

97
0:04:50.755,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and has had a terrible time with math.

98
0:04:53.001,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We have tried everything,

99
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
viewed everything, bought everything.

100
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We stumbled on your video on decimals, and it got through.

101
0:04:59.969,000 --> 0:05:,000
Then we went on to the dreaded fractions.

102
0:05:01.977,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Again, he got it.

103
0:05:03.152,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We could not believe it.

104
0:05:04.342,000 --> 0:05:05,000
He is so excited."

105
0:05:06.444,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And so you can imagine,

106
0:05:07.834,000 --> 0:05:11,000
here I was, an analyst at a hedge fund --

107
0:05:11.992,000 --> 0:05:14,000
it was very strange for me to do something of social value.

108
0:05:15.285,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

109
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Applause)

110
0:05:23.964,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But I was excited, so I kept going.

111
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And then a few other things started to dawn on me;

112
0:05:29.982,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that not only would it help my cousins right now,

113
0:05:32.474,000 --> 0:05:34,000
or these people who were sending letters,

114
0:05:34.553,000 --> 0:05:36,000
but that this content will never grow old,

115
0:05:37.449,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that it could help their kids or their grandkids.

116
0:05:40.767,000 --> 0:05:44,000
If Isaac Newton had done YouTube videos on calculus,

117
0:05:45.553,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I wouldn't have to.

118
0:05:46.815,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Laughter)

119
0:05:48.624,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Assuming he was good. We don't know.

120
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

121
0:05:53.886,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The other thing that happened -- and even at this point, I said,

122
0:05:56.95,000 --> 0:05:59,000
"OK, maybe it's a good supplement. It's good for motivated students.

123
0:06:00.188,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It's good for maybe home-schoolers."

124
0:06:02.038,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But I didn't think it would somehow penetrate the classroom.

125
0:06:05.337,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Then I started getting letters from teachers,

126
0:06:07.487,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and the teachers would write, saying,

127
0:06:09.336,000 --> 0:06:11,000
"We've used your videos to flip the classroom.

128
0:06:11.581,000 --> 0:06:13,000
You've given the lectures, so now what we do --"

129
0:06:14.182,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And this could happen in every classroom in America tomorrow --

130
0:06:17.744,000 --> 0:06:2,000
"what I do is I assign the lectures for homework,

131
0:06:21.022,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and what used to be homework,

132
0:06:23.069,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I now have the students doing in the classroom."

133
0:06:26.045,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And I want to pause here --

134
0:06:28.537,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Applause)

135
0:06:33.154,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I want to pause here, because there's a couple of interesting things.

136
0:06:36.475,000 --> 0:06:38,000
One, when those teachers are doing that,

137
0:06:38.7,000 --> 0:06:39,000
there's the obvious benefit --

138
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
the benefit that now their students

139
0:06:42.784,000 --> 0:06:44,000
can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did,

140
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
they can pause, repeat at their own pace, at their own time.

141
0:06:48.76,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But the more interesting thing -- and this is the unintuitive thing

142
0:06:51.965,000 --> 0:06:53,000
when you talk about technology in the classroom --

143
0:06:54.367,000 --> 0:06:56,000
by removing the one-size-fits-all lecture from the classroom,

144
0:06:57.277,000 --> 0:07:,000
and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home,

145
0:07:00.301,000 --> 0:07:01,000
then when you go to the classroom,

146
0:07:01.976,000 --> 0:07:03,000
letting them do work, having the teacher walk around,

147
0:07:04.5,000 --> 0:07:07,000
having the peers actually be able to interact with each other,

148
0:07:07.61,000 --> 0:07:12,000
these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom.

149
0:07:13.268,000 --> 0:07:15,000
They took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience --

150
0:07:15.754,000 --> 0:07:17,000
30 kids with their fingers on their lips,

151
0:07:18.269,000 --> 0:07:19,000
not allowed to interact with each other.

152
0:07:20.247,000 --> 0:07:21,000
A teacher, no matter how good,

153
0:07:21.763,000 --> 0:07:24,000
has to give this one-size-fits-all lecture to 30 students --

154
0:07:25.096,000 --> 0:07:27,000
blank faces, slightly antagonistic --

155
0:07:27.483,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and now it's a human experience,

156
0:07:29.078,000 --> 0:07:31,000
now they're actually interacting with each other.

157
0:07:31.411,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So once the Khan Academy --

158
0:07:34.22,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I quit my job,

159
0:07:35.396,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and we turned into a real organization --

160
0:07:37.864,000 --> 0:07:38,000
we're a not-for-profit --

161
0:07:39.681,000 --> 0:07:42,000
the question is, how do we take this to the next level?

162
0:07:42.799,000 --> 0:07:45,000
How do we take what those teachers were doing to its natural conclusion?

163
0:07:46.331,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And so, what I'm showing over here,

164
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
these are actual exercises

165
0:07:50.918,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that I started writing for my cousins.

166
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
The ones I started were much more primitive.

167
0:07:55.38,000 --> 0:07:58,000
This is a more competent version of it.

168
0:07:58.774,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But the paradigm here is, we'll generate as many questions as you need,

169
0:08:02.187,000 --> 0:08:05,000
until you get that concept, until you get 10 in a row.

170
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And the Khan Academy videos are there.

171
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
You get hints, the actual steps for that problem,

172
0:08:09.617,000 --> 0:08:1,000
if you don't know how to do it.

173
0:08:11.598,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The paradigm here seems like a very simple thing:

174
0:08:13.932,000 --> 0:08:14,000
10 in a row, you move on.

175
0:08:15.154,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But it's fundamentally different

176
0:08:16.758,000 --> 0:08:18,000
than what's happening in classrooms right now.

177
0:08:19.069,000 --> 0:08:2,000
In a traditional classroom,

178
0:08:20.995,000 --> 0:08:23,000
you have homework, lecture, homework, lecture,

179
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and then you have a snapshot exam.

180
0:08:26.123,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And that exam, whether you get a 70 percent, an 80 percent,

181
0:08:29.804,000 --> 0:08:3,000
a 90 percent or a 95 percent,

182
0:08:31.273,000 --> 0:08:33,000
the class moves on to the next topic.

183
0:08:33.74,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And even that 95 percent student --

184
0:08:35.509,000 --> 0:08:37,000
what was the five percent they didn't know?

185
0:08:37.542,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Maybe they didn't know what happens when you raise something to the zeroth power.

186
0:08:41.387,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Then you build on that in the next concept.

187
0:08:43.66,000 --> 0:08:46,000
That's analogous to -- imagine learning to ride a bicycle.

188
0:08:47.024,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time,

189
0:08:49.917,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and I give you a bicycle for two weeks, then I come back after two weeks,

190
0:08:53.854,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and say, "Well, let's see. You're having trouble taking left turns.

191
0:08:57.028,000 --> 0:09:,000
You can't quite stop. You're an 80 percent bicyclist."

192
0:09:00.289,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So I put a big "C" stamp on your forehead --

193
0:09:02.735,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Laughter)

194
0:09:03.821,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and then I say, "Here's a unicycle."

195
0:09:05.607,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Laughter)

196
0:09:06.725,000 --> 0:09:07,000
But as ridiculous as that sounds,

197
0:09:08.584,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that's exactly what's happening in our classrooms right now.

198
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And the idea is you fast forward

199
0:09:14.893,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and good students start failing algebra all of the sudden,

200
0:09:17.903,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and start failing calculus all of the sudden,

201
0:09:20.231,000 --> 0:09:22,000
despite being smart, despite having good teachers,

202
0:09:22.613,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and it's usually because they have these Swiss cheese gaps

203
0:09:25.381,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that kept building throughout their foundation.

204
0:09:27.614,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So our model is: learn math the way you'd learn anything,

205
0:09:31.216,000 --> 0:09:32,000
like riding a bicycle.

206
0:09:32.586,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Stay on that bicycle. Fall off that bicycle.

207
0:09:35.681,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Do it as long as necessary, until you have mastery.

208
0:09:38.736,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The traditional model,

209
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
it penalizes you for experimentation and failure,

210
0:09:42.856,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but it does not expect mastery.

211
0:09:44.903,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We encourage you to experiment. We encourage you to fail.

212
0:09:47.991,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But we do expect mastery.

213
0:09:51.181,000 --> 0:09:52,000
This is just another one of the modules.

214
0:09:53.125,000 --> 0:09:54,000
This is trigonometry.

215
0:09:54.569,000 --> 0:09:56,000
This is shifting and reflecting functions.

216
0:09:57.831,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And they all fit together.

217
0:09:59.259,000 --> 0:10:,000
We have about 90 of these right now.

218
0:10:01.241,000 --> 0:10:02,000
You can go to the site right now,

219
0:10:02.874,000 --> 0:10:04,000
it's all free, not trying to sell anything.

220
0:10:04.97,000 --> 0:10:07,000
But the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map.

221
0:10:08.134,000 --> 0:10:11,000
That top node right there, that's literally single-digit addition,

222
0:10:11.277,000 --> 0:10:13,000
it's like one plus one is equal to two.

223
0:10:13.576,000 --> 0:10:15,000
The paradigm is, once you get 10 in a row on that,

224
0:10:15.952,000 --> 0:10:18,000
it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules.

225
0:10:19.159,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Further down the knowledge map,

226
0:10:22.262,000 --> 0:10:24,000
we're getting into more advanced arithmetic.

227
0:10:24.533,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Further down, you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra.

228
0:10:27.73,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Further down, you start getting into algebra one, algebra two,

229
0:10:31.497,000 --> 0:10:32,000
a little bit of precalculus.

230
0:10:33.402,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And the idea is, from this we can actually teach everything --

231
0:10:36.623,000 --> 0:10:39,000
well, everything that can be taught in this type of a framework.

232
0:10:40.489,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So you can imagine -- and this is what we are working on --

233
0:10:43.322,000 --> 0:10:46,000
from this knowledge map, you have logic, you have computer programming,

234
0:10:46.909,000 --> 0:10:48,000
you have grammar, you have genetics,

235
0:10:49.433,000 --> 0:10:52,000
all based off of that core of, if you know this and that,

236
0:10:52.616,000 --> 0:10:54,000
now you're ready for this next concept.

237
0:10:55.869,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Now that can work well for an individual learner,

238
0:10:58.195,000 --> 0:11:,000
and I encourage you to do it with your kids,

239
0:11:00.351,000 --> 0:11:03,000
but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself.

240
0:11:03.414,000 --> 0:11:05,000
It'll change what happens at the dinner table.

241
0:11:05.64,000 --> 0:11:06,000
But what we want to do

242
0:11:06.82,000 --> 0:11:09,000
is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom

243
0:11:09.922,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that those early teachers had emailed me about.

244
0:11:12.319,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And so what I'm showing you here,

245
0:11:13.936,000 --> 0:11:15,000
this is data from a pilot in the Los Altos school district,

246
0:11:16.848,000 --> 0:11:19,000
where they took two fifth-grade classes and two seventh-grade classes,

247
0:11:20.188,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and completely gutted their old math curriculum.

248
0:11:22.463,000 --> 0:11:25,000
These kids aren't using textbooks, or getting one-size-fits-all lectures.

249
0:11:25.922,000 --> 0:11:28,000
They're doing Khan Academy, that software, for roughly half of their math class.

250
0:11:29.939,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I want to be clear: we don't view this as a complete math education.

251
0:11:33.17,000 --> 0:11:35,000
What it does is -- this is what's happening in Los Altos --

252
0:11:36.092,000 --> 0:11:38,000
it frees up time -- it's the blocking and tackling,

253
0:11:38.517,000 --> 0:11:4,000
making sure you know how to move through a system of equations,

254
0:11:41.517,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and it frees up time for the simulations, for the games,

255
0:11:44.176,000 --> 0:11:46,000
for the mechanics, for the robot-building,

256
0:11:46.216,000 --> 0:11:48,000
for the estimating how high that hill is based on its shadow.

257
0:11:49.122,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day,

258
0:11:51.702,000 --> 0:11:52,000
every kid works at their own pace --

259
0:11:53.504,000 --> 0:11:56,000
this is actually a live dashboard from the Los Altos school district --

260
0:11:57.059,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and they look at this dashboard.

261
0:11:58.654,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Every row is a student.

262
0:12:00.368,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Every column is one of those concepts.

263
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Green means the student's already proficient.

264
0:12:04.427,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Blue means they're working on it -- no need to worry.

265
0:12:06.975,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Red means they're stuck.

266
0:12:08.688,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And what the teacher does is literally just say,

267
0:12:11.957,000 --> 0:12:12,000
"Let me intervene on the red kids."

268
0:12:13.656,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Or even better, "Let me get one of the green kids,

269
0:12:16.045,000 --> 0:12:18,000
who are already proficient in that concept,

270
0:12:18.115,000 --> 0:12:21,000
to be the first line of attack, and actually tutor their peer."

271
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
(Applause)

272
0:12:28.885,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Now, I come from a very data-centric reality,

273
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
so we don't want that teacher to even go and intervene

274
0:12:35.023,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and have to ask the kid awkward questions:

275
0:12:37.093,000 --> 0:12:4,000
"What don't you understand? What do you understand?" and all the rest.

276
0:12:40.427,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So our paradigm is to arm teachers with as much data as possible --

277
0:12:43.686,000 --> 0:12:45,000
data that, in any other field, is expected,

278
0:12:45.76,000 --> 0:12:47,000
in finance, marketing, manufacturing --

279
0:12:47.823,000 --> 0:12:49,000
so the teachers can diagnose what's wrong with the students

280
0:12:50.644,000 --> 0:12:52,000
so they can make their interaction as productive as possible.

281
0:12:53.556,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Now teachers know exactly what the students have been up to,

282
0:12:56.414,000 --> 0:12:58,000
how long they've spent each day, what videos they've watched,

283
0:12:59.323,000 --> 0:13:01,000
when did they pause the videos, what did they stop watching,

284
0:13:02.181,000 --> 0:13:04,000
what exercises are they using, what have they focused on?

285
0:13:04.928,000 --> 0:13:06,000
The outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on.

286
0:13:07.825,000 --> 0:13:09,000
The inner circle shows the videos they're focused on.

287
0:13:11.141,000 --> 0:13:12,000
The data gets pretty granular,

288
0:13:12.602,000 --> 0:13:15,000
so you can see the exact problems the student got right or wrong.

289
0:13:15.713,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Red is wrong, blue is right.

290
0:13:17.466,000 --> 0:13:19,000
The leftmost question is the first one the student attempted.

291
0:13:20.464,000 --> 0:13:21,000
They watched the video over there.

292
0:13:22.13,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And you can see, eventually they were able to get 10 in a row.

293
0:13:25.098,000 --> 0:13:28,000
It's almost like you can see them learning over those last 10 problems.

294
0:13:28.477,000 --> 0:13:31,000
They also got faster -- the height is how long it took them.

295
0:13:33.481,000 --> 0:13:37,000
When you talk about self-paced learning, it makes sense for everyone --

296
0:13:38.004,000 --> 0:13:4,000
in education-speak, "differentiated learning" --

297
0:13:40.449,000 --> 0:13:43,000
but it's kind of crazy, what happens when you see it in a classroom.

298
0:13:44.155,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Because every time we've done this, in every classroom we've done,

299
0:13:48.623,000 --> 0:13:5,000
over and over again, if you go five days into it,

300
0:13:50.971,000 --> 0:13:52,000
there's a group of kids who've raced ahead

301
0:13:53.008,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and a group who are a little bit slower.

302
0:13:54.945,000 --> 0:13:56,000
In a traditional model, in a snapshot assessment,

303
0:13:57.372,000 --> 0:13:59,000
you say, "These are the gifted kids, these are the slow kids.

304
0:14:00.308,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Maybe they should be tracked differently.

305
0:14:02.3,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Maybe we should put them in different classes."

306
0:14:04.554,000 --> 0:14:06,000
But when you let students work at their own pace --

307
0:14:06.982,000 --> 0:14:07,000
we see it over and over again --

308
0:14:08.607,000 --> 0:14:1,000
you see students who took a little bit extra time

309
0:14:11.056,000 --> 0:14:12,000
on one concept or the other,

310
0:14:12.931,000 --> 0:14:14,000
but once they get through that concept,

311
0:14:15.151,000 --> 0:14:16,000
they just race ahead.

312
0:14:16.523,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago,

313
0:14:19.919,000 --> 0:14:2,000
you now would think are gifted.

314
0:14:21.602,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And we're seeing it over and over again.

315
0:14:23.618,000 --> 0:14:24,000
It makes you really wonder

316
0:14:25.427,000 --> 0:14:28,000
how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from

317
0:14:28.75,000 --> 0:14:3,000
were really just due to a coincidence of time.

318
0:14:34.487,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Now as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos,

319
0:14:39.543,000 --> 0:14:4,000
our goal is to use technology

320
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
to humanize, not just in Los Altos, but on a global scale,

321
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
what's happening in education.

322
0:14:46.787,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And that brings up an interesting point.

323
0:14:49.112,000 --> 0:14:51,000
A lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom

324
0:14:51.866,000 --> 0:14:53,000
is focused on student-to-teacher ratios.

325
0:14:54.81,000 --> 0:14:56,000
In our mind, the relevant metric is:

326
0:14:57.333,000 --> 0:15:,000
student-to-valuable-human-time- with-the-teacher ratio.

327
0:15:01.259,000 --> 0:15:03,000
So in a traditional model, most of the teacher's time

328
0:15:03.808,000 --> 0:15:05,000
is spent doing lectures and grading and whatnot.

329
0:15:06.204,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Maybe five percent of their time is sitting next to students

330
0:15:09.124,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and working with them.

331
0:15:10.308,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Now, 100 percent of their time is.

332
0:15:12.339,000 --> 0:15:15,000
So once again, using technology, not just flipping the classroom,

333
0:15:15.633,000 --> 0:15:17,000
you're humanizing the classroom, I'd argue,

334
0:15:18.015,000 --> 0:15:2,000
by a factor of five or 10.

335
0:15:20.656,000 --> 0:15:21,000
As valuable as that is in Los Altos,

336
0:15:22.41,000 --> 0:15:24,000
imagine what it does to the adult learner,

337
0:15:24.475,000 --> 0:15:26,000
who's embarrassed to go back and learn stuff

338
0:15:26.562,000 --> 0:15:28,000
they should have known before going back to college.

339
0:15:29.038,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Imagine what it does to a street kid in Calcutta,

340
0:15:34.995,000 --> 0:15:36,000
who has to help his family during the day,

341
0:15:37.761,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and that's the reason he or she can't go to school.

342
0:15:40.191,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Now they can spend two hours a day and remediate,

343
0:15:42.698,000 --> 0:15:44,000
or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed

344
0:15:45.047,000 --> 0:15:47,000
about what they do or don't know.

345
0:15:47.666,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Now imagine what happens where --

346
0:15:49.318,000 --> 0:15:51,000
we talked about the peers teaching each other

347
0:15:52.253,000 --> 0:15:53,000
inside of a classroom.

348
0:15:54.086,000 --> 0:15:55,000
But this is all one system.

349
0:15:55.84,000 --> 0:15:58,000
There's no reason why you can't have that peer-to-peer tutoring

350
0:15:59.166,000 --> 0:16:01,000
beyond that one classroom.

351
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Imagine what happens if that student in Calcutta

352
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
all of the sudden can tutor your son,

353
0:16:06.452,000 --> 0:16:08,000
or your son can tutor that kid in Calcutta.

354
0:16:09.381,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And I think what you'll see emerging

355
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
is this notion of a global one-world classroom.

356
0:16:17.862,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And that's essentially what we're trying to build.

357
0:16:21.822,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Thank you.

358
0:16:22.998,000 --> 0:16:28,000
(Applause)

359
0:16:31.22,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Bill Gates: I'll ask about two or three questions.

360
0:16:33.68,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Salman Khan: Oh, OK.

361
0:16:35.426,000 --> 0:16:36,000
(Applause continues)

362
0:17:02.971,000 --> 0:17:03,000
(Applause ends)

363
0:17:04.344,000 --> 0:17:06,000
BG: I've seen some things you're doing in the system,

364
0:17:07.304,000 --> 0:17:09,000
that have to do with motivation and feedback --

365
0:17:09.765,000 --> 0:17:11,000
energy points, merit badges.

366
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
Tell me what you're thinking there.

367
0:17:14.315,000 --> 0:17:16,000
SK: Oh yeah. No, we have an awesome team working on it.

368
0:17:16.935,000 --> 0:17:18,000
I have to be clear, it's not just me anymore.

369
0:17:19.062,000 --> 0:17:2,000
I'm still doing all the videos,

370
0:17:20.571,000 --> 0:17:22,000
but we have a rock-star team doing the software.

371
0:17:22.897,000 --> 0:17:25,000
We've put a bunch of game mechanics in there, where you get badges,

372
0:17:26.08,000 --> 0:17:29,000
we're going to start having leader boards by area, you get points.

373
0:17:29.363,000 --> 0:17:3,000
It's actually been pretty interesting.

374
0:17:31.213,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Just the wording of the badging,

375
0:17:32.796,000 --> 0:17:34,000
or how many points you get for doing something,

376
0:17:35.027,000 --> 0:17:36,000
we see on a system-wide basis,

377
0:17:36.688,000 --> 0:17:38,000
like tens of thousands of fifth-graders or sixth-graders

378
0:17:39.35,000 --> 0:17:42,000
going one direction or another, depending what badge you give them.

379
0:17:42.549,000 --> 0:17:44,000
(Laughter)

380
0:17:44.636,000 --> 0:17:46,000
BG: And the collaboration you're doing with Los Altos,

381
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
how did that come about?

382
0:17:49.461,000 --> 0:17:52,000
SK: Los Altos, it was kind of crazy.

383
0:17:52.524,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Once again, I didn't expect it to be used in classrooms.

384
0:17:55.357,000 --> 0:17:56,000
Someone from their board came and said,

385
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
"What would you do if you had carte Blanche in a classroom?"

386
0:18:00.111,000 --> 0:18:03,000
I said, "Well, every student would work at their own pace,

387
0:18:03.151,000 --> 0:18:05,000
on something like this, we'd give a dashboard."

388
0:18:05.372,000 --> 0:18:08,000
They said, "This is kind of radical. We have to think about it."

389
0:18:08.595,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Me and the rest of the team were like, "They're never going to want to do this."

390
0:18:12.421,000 --> 0:18:15,000
But literally the next day they were like, "Can you start in two weeks?"

391
0:18:15.866,000 --> 0:18:16,000
(Laughter)

392
0:18:17.341,000 --> 0:18:19,000
BG: So fifth-grade math is where that's going on right now?

393
0:18:20.262,000 --> 0:18:22,000
SK: It's two fifth-grade classes and two seventh-grade classes.

394
0:18:23.285,000 --> 0:18:24,000
They're doing it at the district level.

395
0:18:25.175,000 --> 0:18:28,000
I think what they're excited about is they can follow these kids,

396
0:18:28.271,000 --> 0:18:31,000
not only in school; on Christmas, we saw some of the kids were doing it.

397
0:18:31.708,000 --> 0:18:34,000
We can track everything, track them as they go through the entire district.

398
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
Through the summers, as they go from one teacher to the next,

399
0:18:38.212,000 --> 0:18:41,000
you have this continuity of data that even at the district level, they can see.

400
0:18:42.036,000 --> 0:18:45,000
BG: So some of those views we saw were for the teacher

401
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
to go in and track actually what's going on with those kids.

402
0:18:48.975,000 --> 0:18:5,000
So you're getting feedback on those teacher views

403
0:18:51.325,000 --> 0:18:52,000
to see what they think they need?

404
0:18:53.062,000 --> 0:18:57,000
SK: Oh yeah. Most of those were specs by the teachers.

405
0:18:57.442,000 --> 0:19:,000
We made some of those for students so they could see their data,

406
0:19:00.476,000 --> 0:19:03,000
but we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves.

407
0:19:03.612,000 --> 0:19:05,000
And they're saying, "Hey, this is nice, but --"

408
0:19:05.86,000 --> 0:19:07,000
Like that focus graph, a lot of the teachers said,

409
0:19:08.273,000 --> 0:19:1,000
"I have a feeling a lot of the kids are jumping around

410
0:19:10.837,000 --> 0:19:11,000
and not focusing on one topic."

411
0:19:12.463,000 --> 0:19:13,000
So we made that focus diagram.

412
0:19:13.96,000 --> 0:19:15,000
So it's all been teacher-driven. It's been pretty crazy.

413
0:19:16.624,000 --> 0:19:17,000
BG: Is this ready for prime time?

414
0:19:18.221,000 --> 0:19:22,000
Do you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out?

415
0:19:22.599,000 --> 0:19:23,000
SK: Yeah, it's ready.

416
0:19:23.781,000 --> 0:19:25,000
We've got a million people on the site already,

417
0:19:26.523,000 --> 0:19:28,000
so we can handle a few more.

418
0:19:29.479,000 --> 0:19:3,000
(Laughter)

419
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:32,000
No, no reason why it really can't happen

420
0:19:33.26,000 --> 0:19:35,000
in every classroom in America tomorrow.

421
0:19:35.894,000 --> 0:19:37,000
BG: And the vision of the tutoring thing.

422
0:19:38.398,000 --> 0:19:4,000
The idea there is, if I'm confused about a topic,

423
0:19:41.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
somehow right in the user interface,

424
0:19:43.436,000 --> 0:19:45,000
I'd find people who are volunteering,

425
0:19:45.596,000 --> 0:19:46,000
maybe see their reputation,

426
0:19:47.358,000 --> 0:19:5,000
and I could schedule and connect up with those people?

427
0:19:50.559,000 --> 0:19:53,000
SK: Absolutely. And this is something I recommend everyone in this audience do.

428
0:19:54.332,000 --> 0:19:57,000
Those dashboards the teachers have, you can go log in right now

429
0:19:57.418,000 --> 0:19:58,000
and you can essentially become a coach

430
0:19:59.26,000 --> 0:20:01,000
for your kids, your nephews, your cousins,

431
0:20:02.26,000 --> 0:20:04,000
or maybe some kids at the Boys and Girls Club.

432
0:20:05.113,000 --> 0:20:07,000
And yeah, you can start becoming a mentor, a tutor,

433
0:20:07.669,000 --> 0:20:08,000
really immediately.

434
0:20:09.165,000 --> 0:20:1,000
But yeah, it's all there.

435
0:20:11.15,000 --> 0:20:12,000
BG: Well, it's amazing.

436
0:20:12.332,000 --> 0:20:15,000
I think you just got a glimpse of the future of education.

437
0:20:15.418,000 --> 0:20:16,000
BG: Thank you. SK: Thank you.

438
0:20:17.26,000 --> 0:20:2,000
(Applause)

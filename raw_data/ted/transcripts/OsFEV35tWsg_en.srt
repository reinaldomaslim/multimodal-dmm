1
0:00:12.794,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Philosophers, dramatists, theologians

2
0:00:16.374,000 --> 0:00:18,000
have grappled with this question for centuries:

3
0:00:18.604,000 --> 0:00:19,000
what makes people go wrong?

4
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Interestingly, I asked this question when I was a little kid.

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I grew up in the South Bronx, inner-city ghetto in New York,

6
0:00:26.24,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and I was surrounded by evil,

7
0:00:27.747,000 --> 0:00:29,000
as all kids are who grew up in an inner city.

8
0:00:30.327,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And I had friends who were really good kids,

9
0:00:32.676,000 --> 0:00:36,000
who lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde scenario -- Robert Louis Stevenson.

10
0:00:36.992,000 --> 0:00:39,000
That is, they took drugs, got in trouble, went to jail.

11
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Some got killed, and some did it without drug assistance.

12
0:00:44.448,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So when I read Robert Louis Stevenson, that wasn't fiction.

13
0:00:47.266,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The only question is, what was in the juice?

14
0:00:49.514,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And more importantly, that line between good and evil --

15
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
which privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable,

16
0:00:56.652,000 --> 0:00:58,000
with them on the good side, the others on the bad side --

17
0:00:59.349,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I knew that line was movable, and it was permeable.

18
0:01:02.436,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Good people could be seduced across that line,

19
0:01:04.803,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and under good and some rare circumstances, bad kids could recover

20
0:01:09.031,000 --> 0:01:11,000
with help, with reform, with rehabilitation.

21
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So I want to begin with this wonderful illusion

22
0:01:14.661,000 --> 0:01:16,000
by [Dutch] artist M.C. Escher.

23
0:01:16.959,000 --> 0:01:19,000
If you look at it and focus on the white, what you see is a world full of angels.

24
0:01:20.844,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But let's look more deeply, and as we do,

25
0:01:23.436,000 --> 0:01:26,000
what appears is the demons, the devils in the world.

26
0:01:26.992,000 --> 0:01:27,000
That tells us several things.

27
0:01:28.397,000 --> 0:01:31,000
One, the world is, was, will always be filled with good and evil,

28
0:01:31.529,000 --> 0:01:34,000
because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition.

29
0:01:34.601,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It tells me something else.

30
0:01:35.911,000 --> 0:01:38,000
If you remember, God's favorite angel was Lucifer.

31
0:01:39.449,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Apparently, Lucifer means "the light."

32
0:01:41.911,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It also means "the morning star," in some scripture.

33
0:01:44.661,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And apparently, he disobeyed God,

34
0:01:47.89,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and that's the ultimate disobedience to authority.

35
0:01:50.406,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And when he did, Michael, the archangel, was sent to kick him out of heaven

36
0:01:55.928,000 --> 0:01:57,000
along with the other fallen angels.

37
0:01:57.955,000 --> 0:02:,000
And so Lucifer descends into hell, becomes Satan,

38
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
becomes the devil, and the force of evil in the universe begins.

39
0:02:04.184,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Paradoxically, it was God who created hell as a place to store evil.

40
0:02:09.136,000 --> 0:02:11,000
He didn't do a good job of keeping it there though.

41
0:02:11.541,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So, this arc of the cosmic transformation of God's favorite angel into the Devil,

42
0:02:16.154,000 --> 0:02:19,000
for me, sets the context for understanding human beings

43
0:02:19.822,000 --> 0:02:23,000
who are transformed from good, ordinary people into perpetrators of evil.

44
0:02:24.737,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So the Lucifer effect, although it focuses on the negatives --

45
0:02:28.788,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the negatives that people can become,

46
0:02:31.467,000 --> 0:02:32,000
not the negatives that people are --

47
0:02:33.453,000 --> 0:02:36,000
leads me to a psychological definition.

48
0:02:36.831,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Evil is the exercise of power.

49
0:02:38.828,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And that's the key: it's about power.

50
0:02:41.091,000 --> 0:02:43,000
To intentionally harm people psychologically,

51
0:02:43.68,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to hurt people physically, to destroy people mortally, or ideas,

52
0:02:47.434,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and to commit crimes against humanity.

53
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
If you Google "evil," a word that should surely have withered by now,

54
0:02:54.47,000 --> 0:02:57,000
you come up with 136 million hits in a third of a second.

55
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
A few years ago -- I am sure all of you were shocked, as I was,

56
0:03:02.682,000 --> 0:03:07,000
with the revelation of American soldiers abusing prisoners in a strange place

57
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
in a controversial war, Abu Ghraib in Iraq.

58
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And these were men and women

59
0:03:13.191,000 --> 0:03:17,000
who were putting prisoners through unbelievable humiliation.

60
0:03:18.136,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I was shocked, but I wasn't surprised,

61
0:03:19.97,000 --> 0:03:21,000
because I had seen those same visual parallels

62
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
when I was the prison superintendent of the Stanford Prison Study.

63
0:03:25.586,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Immediately the Bush administration military said what?

64
0:03:28.681,000 --> 0:03:3,000
What all administrations say when there's a scandal:

65
0:03:31.205,000 --> 0:03:32,000
"Don't blame us. It's not the system.

66
0:03:33.079,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It's the few bad apples, the few rogue soldiers."

67
0:03:35.503,000 --> 0:03:38,000
My hypothesis is, American soldiers are good, usually.

68
0:03:38.558,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Maybe it was the barrel that was bad.

69
0:03:40.643,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But how am I going to deal with that hypothesis?

70
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I became an expert witness for one of the guards,

71
0:03:45.704,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Sergeant Chip Frederick, and in that position,

72
0:03:47.871,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I had access to the dozen investigative reports.

73
0:03:50.808,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I had access to him.

74
0:03:52.632,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I could study him, have him come to my home, get to know him,

75
0:03:55.957,000 --> 0:03:58,000
do psychological analysis to see, was he a good apple or bad apple.

76
0:03:59.388,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And thirdly, I had access to all of the 1,000 pictures

77
0:04:03.323,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that these soldiers took.

78
0:04:05.025,000 --> 0:04:07,000
These pictures are of a violent or sexual nature.

79
0:04:07.559,000 --> 0:04:09,000
All of them come from the cameras of American soldiers.

80
0:04:10.969,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Because everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera,

81
0:04:13.852,000 --> 0:04:15,000
they took pictures of everything, more than 1,000.

82
0:04:16.21,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And what I've done is I organized them into various categories.

83
0:04:19.188,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But these are by United States military police, army reservists.

84
0:04:24.637,000 --> 0:04:27,000
They are not soldiers prepared for this mission at all.

85
0:04:28.143,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And it all happened in a single place, Tier 1-A, on the night shift.

86
0:04:31.84,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Why?

87
0:04:33.065,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Tier 1-A was the center for military intelligence.

88
0:04:35.691,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It was the interrogation hold.

89
0:04:37.691,000 --> 0:04:38,000
The CIA was there.

90
0:04:38.916,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Interrogators from Titan Corporation, all there,

91
0:04:42.098,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and they're getting no information about the insurgency.

92
0:04:44.908,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So they're going to put pressure on these soldiers,

93
0:04:47.402,000 --> 0:04:48,000
military police, to cross the line,

94
0:04:49.146,000 --> 0:04:51,000
give them permission to break the will of the enemy,

95
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to prepare them for interrogation, to soften them up,

96
0:04:54.661,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to take the gloves off.

97
0:04:55.911,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Those are the euphemisms, and this is how it was interpreted.

98
0:04:59.794,000 --> 0:05:,000
Let's go down to that dungeon.

99
0:05:03.445,000 --> 0:05:04,000

(Bells end)

109
0:06:49.239,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So, pretty horrific.

110
0:06:51.501,000 --> 0:06:54,000
That's one of the visual illustrations of evil.

111
0:06:55.332,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And it should not have escaped you

112
0:06:57.117,000 --> 0:07:,000
that the reason I paired the prisoner with his arms out

113
0:07:00.378,000 --> 0:07:02,000
with Leonardo da Vinci's ode to humanity

114
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
is that that prisoner was mentally ill.

115
0:07:05.766,000 --> 0:07:07,000
That prisoner covered himself with shit every day,

116
0:07:08.143,000 --> 0:07:1,000
they had to roll him in dirt so he wouldn't stink.

117
0:07:10.585,000 --> 0:07:12,000
But the guards ended up calling him "Shit Boy."

118
0:07:12.957,000 --> 0:07:16,000
What was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution?

119
0:07:17.657,000 --> 0:07:19,000
In any event, here's former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld.

120
0:07:20.396,000 --> 0:07:22,000
He comes down and says, "I want to know, who is responsible?

121
0:07:23.23,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Who are the bad apples?"

122
0:07:24.633,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Well, that's a bad question.

123
0:07:26.065,000 --> 0:07:28,000
You have to reframe it and ask, "What is responsible?"

124
0:07:28.71,000 --> 0:07:29,000
"What" could be the who of people,

125
0:07:30.382,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but it could also be the what of the situation,

126
0:07:32.943,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and obviously that's wrongheaded.

127
0:07:34.653,000 --> 0:07:37,000
How do psychologists try to understand such transformations of human character,

128
0:07:38.522,000 --> 0:07:4,000
if you believe that they were good soldiers

129
0:07:40.546,000 --> 0:07:41,000
before they went down to that dungeon?

130
0:07:42.38,000 --> 0:07:44,000
There are three ways. The main way is called dispositional.

131
0:07:45.266,000 --> 0:07:47,000
We look at what's inside of the person, the bad apples.

132
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
This is the foundation of all of social science,

133
0:07:51.495,000 --> 0:07:53,000
the foundation of religion, the foundation of war.

134
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Social psychologists like me come along and say,

135
0:07:57.423,000 --> 0:07:59,000
"Yeah, people are the actors on the stage,

136
0:07:59.566,000 --> 0:08:01,000
but you'll have to be aware of the situation.

137
0:08:01.94,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Who are the cast of characters? What's the costume?

138
0:08:04.345,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Is there a stage director?"

139
0:08:05.828,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And so we're interested in what are the external factors

140
0:08:08.519,000 --> 0:08:09,000
around the individual -- the bad barrel?

141
0:08:11.064,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Social scientists stop there and they miss the big point

142
0:08:13.735,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that I discovered when I became an expert witness for Abu Ghraib.

143
0:08:16.998,000 --> 0:08:17,000
The power is in the system.

144
0:08:18.573,000 --> 0:08:21,000
The system creates the situation that corrupts the individuals,

145
0:08:21.838,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and the system is the legal, political, economic, cultural background.

146
0:08:26.646,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And this is where the power is of the bad-barrel makers.

147
0:08:30.299,000 --> 0:08:32,000
If you want to change a person, change the situation.

148
0:08:32.824,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And to change it, you've got to know where the power is, in the system.

149
0:08:36.237,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So the Lucifer effect involves understanding

150
0:08:38.309,000 --> 0:08:42,000
human character transformations with these three factors.

151
0:08:43.284,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And it's a dynamic interplay.

152
0:08:44.697,000 --> 0:08:46,000
What do the people bring into the situation?

153
0:08:46.787,000 --> 0:08:48,000
What does the situation bring out of them?

154
0:08:48.819,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And what is the system that creates and maintains that situation?

155
0:08:52.784,000 --> 0:08:54,000
My recent book, "The Lucifer Effect," is about,

156
0:08:55.092,000 --> 0:08:57,000
how do you understand how good people turn evil?

157
0:08:57.355,000 --> 0:09:,000
And it has a lot of detail about what I'm going to talk about today.

158
0:09:01.056,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So Dr. Z's "Lucifer Effect," although it focuses on evil,

159
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
really is a celebration of the human mind's infinite capacity

160
0:09:08.344,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to make any of us kind or cruel,

161
0:09:10.926,000 --> 0:09:12,000
caring or indifferent, creative or destructive,

162
0:09:13.472,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and it makes some of us villains.

163
0:09:15.774,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And the good news that I'm going to hopefully come to at the end

164
0:09:18.895,000 --> 0:09:19,000
is that it makes some of us heroes.

165
0:09:21.811,000 --> 0:09:24,000
This wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker summarizes my whole talk:

166
0:09:25.384,000 --> 0:09:27,000
"I'm neither a good cop nor a bad cop, Jerome.

167
0:09:27.551,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Like yourself, I'm a complex amalgam

168
0:09:29.534,000 --> 0:09:31,000
of positive and negative personality traits

169
0:09:32.027,000 --> 0:09:35,000
that emerge or not, depending on the circumstances."

170
0:09:35.541,000 --> 0:09:36,000
(Laughter)

171
0:09:37.55,000 --> 0:09:39,000
There's a study some of you think you know about,

172
0:09:40.426,000 --> 0:09:42,000
but very few people have ever read the story.

173
0:09:42.637,000 --> 0:09:43,000
You watched the movie.

174
0:09:44.586,000 --> 0:09:47,000
This is Stanley Milgram, little Jewish kid from the Bronx,

175
0:09:47.959,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and he asked the question, "Could the Holocaust happen here, now?"

176
0:09:51.082,000 --> 0:09:54,000
People say, "No, that's Nazi Germany, Hitler, you know, that's 1939."

177
0:09:54.611,000 --> 0:09:56,000
He said, "Yeah, but suppose Hitler asked you,

178
0:09:57.028,000 --> 0:10:,000
'Would you electrocute a stranger?' 'No way, I'm a good person.'"

179
0:10:00.222,000 --> 0:10:02,000
He said, "Why don't we put you in a situation

180
0:10:02.342,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and give you a chance to see what you would do?"

181
0:10:04.605,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And so what he did was he tested 1,000 ordinary people.

182
0:10:07.714,000 --> 0:10:11,000
500 New Haven, Connecticut, 500 Bridgeport.

183
0:10:11.805,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And the ad said, "Psychologists want to understand memory.

184
0:10:14.544,000 --> 0:10:17,000
We want to improve people's memory, because it is the key to success."

185
0:10:17.862,000 --> 0:10:18,000
OK?

186
0:10:20.064,000 --> 0:10:23,000
"We're going to give you five bucks -- four dollars for your time.

187
0:10:24.073,000 --> 0:10:27,000
We don't want college students. We want men between 20 and 50."

188
0:10:27.551,000 --> 0:10:28,000
In the later studies, they ran women.

189
0:10:29.337,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Ordinary people: barbers, clerks, white-collar people.

190
0:10:32.434,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So, you go down,

191
0:10:34.038,000 --> 0:10:36,000
one of you will be a learner, one will be a teacher.

192
0:10:36.573,000 --> 0:10:37,000
The learner's a genial, middle-aged guy.

193
0:10:38.502,000 --> 0:10:41,000
He gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room.

194
0:10:41.635,000 --> 0:10:44,000
The learner could be middle-aged, could be as young as 20.

195
0:10:45.227,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And one of you is told by the authority, the guy in the lab coat,

196
0:10:48.467,000 --> 0:10:5,000
"Your job as teacher is to give him material to learn.

197
0:10:51.106,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Gets it right, reward.

198
0:10:52.344,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Gets it wrong, you press a button on the shock box.

199
0:10:54.759,000 --> 0:10:56,000
The first button is 15 volts. He doesn't even feel it."

200
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
That's the key.

201
0:10:59.347,000 --> 0:11:,000
All evil starts with 15 volts.

202
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And then the next step is another 15 volts.

203
0:11:04.009,000 --> 0:11:06,000
The problem is, at the end of the line, it's 450 volts.

204
0:11:07.03,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And as you go along, the guy is screaming,

205
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
"I've got a heart condition! I'm out of here!"

206
0:11:11.375,000 --> 0:11:12,000
You're a good person. You complain.

207
0:11:13.105,000 --> 0:11:15,000
"Sir, who will be responsible if something happens to him?"

208
0:11:15.985,000 --> 0:11:17,000
The experimenter says, "Don't worry, I will be responsible.

209
0:11:18.772,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Continue, teacher."

210
0:11:20.125,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And the question is, who would go all the way to 450 volts?

211
0:11:23.954,000 --> 0:11:25,000
You should notice here, when it gets up to 375,

212
0:11:26.554,000 --> 0:11:27,000
it says, "Danger. Severe Shock."

213
0:11:28.103,000 --> 0:11:31,000
When it gets up to here, there's "XXX" -- the pornography of power.

214
0:11:31.897,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So Milgram asks 40 psychiatrists,

215
0:11:34.031,000 --> 0:11:37,000
"What percent of American citizens would go to the end?"

216
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
They said only one percent.

217
0:11:38.685,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Because that's sadistic behavior, and we know, psychiatry knows,

218
0:11:42.275,000 --> 0:11:44,000
only one percent of Americans are sadistic.

219
0:11:44.391,000 --> 0:11:45,000
OK.

220
0:11:46.147,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Here's the data. They could not be more wrong.

221
0:11:48.777,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Two thirds go all the way to 450 volts.

222
0:11:51.622,000 --> 0:11:52,000
This was just one study.

223
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Milgram did more than 16 studies.

224
0:11:55.468,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And look at this.

225
0:11:57.491,000 --> 0:11:59,000
In study 16, where you see somebody like you go all the way,

226
0:12:00.352,000 --> 0:12:01,000
90 percent go all the way.

227
0:12:02.447,000 --> 0:12:04,000
In study five, if you see people rebel,

228
0:12:04.659,000 --> 0:12:05,000
90 percent rebel.

229
0:12:06.772,000 --> 0:12:08,000
What about women? Study 13 -- no different than men.

230
0:12:09.938,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So Milgram is quantifying evil as the willingness of people

231
0:12:13.503,000 --> 0:12:15,000
to blindly obey authority, to go all the way to 450 volts.

232
0:12:16.606,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And it's like a dial on human nature.

233
0:12:18.752,000 --> 0:12:22,000
A dial in a sense that you can make almost everybody totally obedient,

234
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
down to the majority, down to none.

235
0:12:26.767,000 --> 0:12:29,000
What are the external parallels? For all research is artificial.

236
0:12:29.791,000 --> 0:12:3,000
What's the validity in the real world?

237
0:12:31.625,000 --> 0:12:34,000
912 American citizens committed suicide or were murdered

238
0:12:34.663,000 --> 0:12:36,000
by family and friends in Guyana jungle in 1978,

239
0:12:37.672,000 --> 0:12:4,000
because they were blindly obedient to this guy, their pastor --

240
0:12:40.726,000 --> 0:12:42,000
not their priest -- their pastor, Reverend Jim Jones.

241
0:12:43.457,000 --> 0:12:45,000
He persuaded them to commit mass suicide.

242
0:12:46.277,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And so, he's the modern Lucifer effect,

243
0:12:48.166,000 --> 0:12:5,000
a man of God who becomes the Angel of Death.

244
0:12:52.662,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Milgram's study is all about individual authority to control people.

245
0:12:57.793,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Most of the time, we are in institutions,

246
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
so the Stanford Prison Study is a study of the power of institutions

247
0:13:03.721,000 --> 0:13:04,000
to influence individual behavior.

248
0:13:05.685,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Interestingly, Stanley Milgram and I were in the same high school class

249
0:13:09.313,000 --> 0:13:11,000
in James Monroe in the Bronx, 1954.

250
0:13:13.136,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I did this study with my graduate students,

251
0:13:15.247,000 --> 0:13:17,000
especially Craig Haney -- and it also began work with an ad.

252
0:13:18.097,000 --> 0:13:19,000
We had a cheap, little ad,

253
0:13:19.549,000 --> 0:13:21,000
but we wanted college students for a study of prison life.

254
0:13:23.249,000 --> 0:13:25,000
75 people volunteered, took personality tests.

255
0:13:25.713,000 --> 0:13:26,000
We did interviews.

256
0:13:26.987,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Picked two dozen: the most normal, the most healthy.

257
0:13:29.457,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Randomly assigned them to be prisoner and guard.

258
0:13:31.748,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So on day one, we knew we had good apples.

259
0:13:33.792,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I'm going to put them in a bad situation.

260
0:13:35.769,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And secondly, we know there's no difference

261
0:13:38.07,000 --> 0:13:41,000
between the boys who will be guards and those who will be prisoners.

262
0:13:41.436,000 --> 0:13:42,000
To the prisoners, we said,

263
0:13:42.986,000 --> 0:13:44,000
"Wait at home. The study will begin Sunday."

264
0:13:45.136,000 --> 0:13:46,000
We didn't tell them

265
0:13:46.36,000 --> 0:13:49,000
that the city police were going to come and do realistic arrests.

266
0:13:49.579,000 --> 0:13:5,000
(Video) (Music)

267
0:13:55.999,000 --> 0:13:56,000
[Day 1]

268
0:14:23.473,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Student: A police car pulls up in front, and a cop comes to the front door,

269
0:14:28.471,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and knocks, and says he's looking for me.

270
0:14:30.49,000 --> 0:14:32,000
So they, right there, you know, they took me out the door,

271
0:14:33.435,000 --> 0:14:36,000
they put my hands against the car.

272
0:14:36.957,000 --> 0:14:38,000
It was a real cop car, it was a real policeman,

273
0:14:39.182,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and there were real neighbors in the street,

274
0:14:41.269,000 --> 0:14:44,000
who didn't know that this was an experiment.

275
0:14:44.789,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And there was cameras all around and neighbors all around.

276
0:14:47.567,000 --> 0:14:5,000
They put me in the car, then they drove me around Palo Alto.

277
0:14:52.338,000 --> 0:14:56,000
They took me to the basement of the police station.

278
0:15:04.373,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Then they put me in a cell.

279
0:15:05.791,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I was the first one to be picked up, so they put me in a cell,

280
0:15:08.733,000 --> 0:15:1,000
which was just like a room with a door with bars on it.

281
0:15:12.446,000 --> 0:15:13,000
You could tell it wasn't a real jail.

282
0:15:14.264,000 --> 0:15:17,000
They locked me in there, in this degrading little outfit.

283
0:15:18.77,000 --> 0:15:2,000
They were taking this experiment too seriously.

284
0:15:21.369,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Here are the prisoners, who are going to be dehumanized, they'll become numbers.

285
0:15:25.226,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity.

286
0:15:28.142,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Guards get prisoners to clean the toilet bowls out with their bare hands,

287
0:15:31.615,000 --> 0:15:32,000
to do other humiliating tasks.

288
0:15:33.111,000 --> 0:15:35,000
They strip them naked. They sexually taunt them.

289
0:15:35.377,000 --> 0:15:38,000
They begin to do degrading activities, like having them simulate sodomy.

290
0:15:38.938,000 --> 0:15:41,000
You saw simulating fellatio in soldiers in Abu Ghraib.

291
0:15:42.193,000 --> 0:15:43,000
My guards did it in five days.

292
0:15:44.495,000 --> 0:15:45,000
The stress reaction was so extreme

293
0:15:46.346,000 --> 0:15:48,000
that normal kids we picked because they were healthy

294
0:15:48.806,000 --> 0:15:49,000
had breakdowns within 36 hours.

295
0:15:50.413,000 --> 0:15:54,000
The study ended after six days, because it was out of control.

296
0:15:54.462,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Five kids had emotional breakdowns.

297
0:15:58.466,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Does it make a difference

298
0:15:59.943,000 --> 0:16:01,000
if warriors go to battle changing their appearance or not?

299
0:16:02.692,000 --> 0:16:04,000
If they're anonymous, how do they treat their victims?

300
0:16:05.469,000 --> 0:16:08,000
In some cultures, they go to war without changing their appearance.

301
0:16:08.652,000 --> 0:16:1,000
In others, they paint themselves like "Lord of the Flies."

302
0:16:11.404,000 --> 0:16:12,000
In some, they wear masks.

303
0:16:12.62,000 --> 0:16:14,000
In many, soldiers are anonymous in uniform.

304
0:16:14.705,000 --> 0:16:18,000
So this anthropologist, John Watson, found 23 cultures that had two bits of data.

305
0:16:19.426,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Do they change their appearance? 15.

306
0:16:21.789,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Do they kill, torture, mutilate? 13.

307
0:16:24.4,000 --> 0:16:25,000
If they don't change their appearance,

308
0:16:26.247,000 --> 0:16:28,000
only one of eight kills, tortures or mutilates.

309
0:16:28.484,000 --> 0:16:29,000
The key is in the red zone.

310
0:16:29.812,000 --> 0:16:3,000
If they change their appearance,

311
0:16:31.401,000 --> 0:16:34,000
12 of 13 -- that's 90 percent -- kill, torture, mutilate.

312
0:16:35.136,000 --> 0:16:36,000
And that's the power of anonymity.

313
0:16:36.78,000 --> 0:16:37,000
So what are the seven social processes

314
0:16:38.709,000 --> 0:16:39,000
that grease the slippery slope of evil?

315
0:16:40.591,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Mindlessly taking the first small step.

316
0:16:42.741,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Dehumanization of others. De-individuation of self.

317
0:16:45.407,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Diffusion of personal responsibility.

318
0:16:47.333,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Blind obedience to authority.

319
0:16:49.004,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Uncritical conformity to group norms.

320
0:16:50.922,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Passive tolerance of evil through inaction, or indifference.

321
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And it happens when you're in a new or unfamiliar situation.

322
0:16:57.042,000 --> 0:16:59,000
Your habitual response patterns don't work.

323
0:16:59.115,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Your personality and morality are disengaged.

324
0:17:02.803,000 --> 0:17:04,000
"Nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer;

325
0:17:05.137,000 --> 0:17:08,000
nothing more difficult than understanding him," Dostoyevsky.

326
0:17:08.183,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Understanding is not excusing. Psychology is not excuse-ology.

327
0:17:12.219,000 --> 0:17:14,000
So social and psychological research reveals

328
0:17:14.37,000 --> 0:17:17,000
how ordinary, good people can be transformed without the drugs.

329
0:17:17.666,000 --> 0:17:2,000
You don't need it. You just need the social-psychological processes.

330
0:17:20.991,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Real world parallels?

331
0:17:22.71,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Compare this with this.

332
0:17:26.136,000 --> 0:17:28,000
James Schlesinger -- I'm going to end with this -- says,

333
0:17:28.848,000 --> 0:17:3,000
"Psychologists have attempted to understand how and why

334
0:17:31.471,000 --> 0:17:33,000
individuals and groups who usually act humanely

335
0:17:33.924,000 --> 0:17:36,000
can sometimes act otherwise in certain circumstances."

336
0:17:37.136,000 --> 0:17:38,000
That's the Lucifer effect.

337
0:17:38.399,000 --> 0:17:4,000
And he goes on to say, "The landmark Stanford study

338
0:17:40.852,000 --> 0:17:43,000
provides a cautionary tale for all military operations."

339
0:17:44.796,000 --> 0:17:46,000
If you give people power without oversight,

340
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
it's a prescription for abuse.

341
0:17:48.667,000 --> 0:17:5,000
They knew that, and let that happen.

342
0:17:51.837,000 --> 0:17:54,000
So another report, an investigative report by General Fay,

343
0:17:54.941,000 --> 0:17:55,000
says the system is guilty.

344
0:17:56.915,000 --> 0:17:59,000
In this report, he says it was the environment that created Abu Ghraib,

345
0:18:00.402,000 --> 0:18:03,000
by leadership failures that contributed to the occurrence of such abuse,

346
0:18:03.808,000 --> 0:18:04,000
and because it remained undiscovered

347
0:18:05.742,000 --> 0:18:07,000
by higher authorities for a long period of time.

348
0:18:08.006,000 --> 0:18:09,000
Those abuses went on for three months.

349
0:18:09.855,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Who was watching the store?

350
0:18:11.487,000 --> 0:18:13,000
The answer is nobody, I think on purpose.

351
0:18:13.758,000 --> 0:18:15,000
He gave the guards permission to do those things,

352
0:18:16.075,000 --> 0:18:19,000
and they knew nobody was ever going to come down to that dungeon.

353
0:18:19.163,000 --> 0:18:21,000
So you need a paradigm shift in all of these areas.

354
0:18:21.755,000 --> 0:18:24,000
The shift is away from the medical model that focuses only on the individual.

355
0:18:25.456,000 --> 0:18:27,000
The shift is toward a public health model

356
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:31,000
that recognizes situational and systemic vectors of disease.

357
0:18:31.966,000 --> 0:18:33,000
Bullying is a disease. Prejudice is a disease.

358
0:18:34.327,000 --> 0:18:35,000
Violence is a disease.

359
0:18:35.519,000 --> 0:18:38,000
Since the Inquisition, we've been dealing with problems at the individual level.

360
0:18:39.311,000 --> 0:18:4,000
It doesn't work.

361
0:18:40.776,000 --> 0:18:42,000
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn says, "The line between good and evil

362
0:18:43.616,000 --> 0:18:45,000
cuts through the heart of every human being."

363
0:18:45.76,000 --> 0:18:46,000
That means that line is not out there.

364
0:18:47.596,000 --> 0:18:49,000
That's a decision that you have to make, a personal thing.

365
0:18:50.591,000 --> 0:18:52,000
So I want to end very quickly on a positive note.

366
0:18:53.652,000 --> 0:18:55,000
Heroism as the antidote to evil,

367
0:18:56.136,000 --> 0:18:57,000
by promoting the heroic imagination,

368
0:18:58.055,000 --> 0:19:,000
especially in our kids, in our educational system.

369
0:19:00.577,000 --> 0:19:02,000
We want kids to think, "I'm a hero in waiting,

370
0:19:03.065,000 --> 0:19:05,000
waiting for the right situation to come along,

371
0:19:05.232,000 --> 0:19:06,000
and I will act heroically.

372
0:19:06.799,000 --> 0:19:08,000
My whole life, I'm now going to focus away from evil --

373
0:19:09.501,000 --> 0:19:11,000
that I've been in since I was a kid -- to understanding heroes.

374
0:19:12.478,000 --> 0:19:13,000
Banality of heroism.

375
0:19:13.667,000 --> 0:19:15,000
It's ordinary people who do heroic deeds.

376
0:19:15.695,000 --> 0:19:17,000
It's the counterpoint to Hannah Arendt's "Banality of Evil."

377
0:19:18.665,000 --> 0:19:21,000
Our traditional societal heroes are wrong, because they are the exceptions.

378
0:19:22.65,000 --> 0:19:25,000
They organize their life around this. That's why we know their names.

379
0:19:26.009,000 --> 0:19:28,000
Our kids' heroes are also wrong models for them,

380
0:19:28.311,000 --> 0:19:29,000
because they have supernatural talents.

381
0:19:30.279,000 --> 0:19:32,000
We want our kids to realize most heroes are everyday people,

382
0:19:33.264,000 --> 0:19:35,000
and the heroic act is unusual.

383
0:19:35.392,000 --> 0:19:36,000
This is Joe Darby.

384
0:19:36.707,000 --> 0:19:38,000
He was the one that stopped those abuses you saw,

385
0:19:39.017,000 --> 0:19:4,000
because when he saw those images,

386
0:19:40.634,000 --> 0:19:42,000
he turned them over to a senior investigating officer.

387
0:19:43.229,000 --> 0:19:45,000
He was a low-level private, and that stopped it.

388
0:19:45.981,000 --> 0:19:46,000
Was he a hero? No.

389
0:19:47.183,000 --> 0:19:5,000
They had to put him in hiding, because people wanted to kill him,

390
0:19:50.357,000 --> 0:19:51,000
and then his mother and his wife.

391
0:19:52.033,000 --> 0:19:53,000
For three years, they were in hiding.

392
0:19:53.942,000 --> 0:19:55,000
This is the woman who stopped the Stanford Prison Study.

393
0:19:56.652,000 --> 0:19:59,000
When I said it got out of control, I was the prison superintendent.

394
0:19:59.925,000 --> 0:20:01,000
I didn't know it was out of control. I was totally indifferent.

395
0:20:02.948,000 --> 0:20:03,000
She saw that madhouse and said,

396
0:20:04.563,000 --> 0:20:06,000
"You know what, it's terrible what you're doing to those boys.

397
0:20:07.492,000 --> 0:20:1,000
They're not prisoners nor guards, they're boys, and you are responsible."

398
0:20:11.16,000 --> 0:20:12,000
And I ended the study the next day.

399
0:20:13.699,000 --> 0:20:15,000
The good news is I married her the next year.

400
0:20:15.833,000 --> 0:20:17,000
(Laughter)

401
0:20:18.16,000 --> 0:20:25,000
(Applause)

402
0:20:25.605,000 --> 0:20:27,000
I just came to my senses, obviously.

403
0:20:27.64,000 --> 0:20:29,000
So situations have the power to do [three things].

404
0:20:30.333,000 --> 0:20:32,000
But the point is, this is the same situation

405
0:20:33.138,000 --> 0:20:36,000
that can inflame the hostile imagination in some of us,

406
0:20:36.628,000 --> 0:20:37,000
that makes us perpetrators of evil,

407
0:20:38.389,000 --> 0:20:4,000
can inspire the heroic imagination in others.

408
0:20:40.606,000 --> 0:20:43,000
It's the same situation and you're on one side or the other.

409
0:20:43.744,000 --> 0:20:45,000
Most people are guilty of the evil of inaction,

410
0:20:45.959,000 --> 0:20:48,000
because your mother said, "Don't get involved. Mind your own business."

411
0:20:49.331,000 --> 0:20:51,000
And you have to say, "Mama, humanity is my business."

412
0:20:51.832,000 --> 0:20:54,000
So the psychology of heroism is -- we're going to end in a moment --

413
0:20:55.047,000 --> 0:20:57,000
how do we encourage children in new hero courses,

414
0:20:57.498,000 --> 0:21:,000
that I'm working on with Matt Langdon -- he has a hero workshop --

415
0:21:00.814,000 --> 0:21:03,000
to develop this heroic imagination, this self-labeling,

416
0:21:03.881,000 --> 0:21:05,000
"I am a hero in waiting," and teach them skills.

417
0:21:06.668,000 --> 0:21:08,000
To be a hero, you have to learn to be a deviant,

418
0:21:09.047,000 --> 0:21:12,000
because you're always going against the conformity of the group.

419
0:21:12.697,000 --> 0:21:15,000
Heroes are ordinary people whose social actions are extraordinary. Who act.

420
0:21:16.561,000 --> 0:21:17,000
The key to heroism is two things.

421
0:21:18.336,000 --> 0:21:2,000
You have to act when other people are passive.

422
0:21:20.741,000 --> 0:21:22,000
B: You have to act socio-centrically, not egocentrically.

423
0:21:23.532,000 --> 0:21:26,000
And I want to end with a known story about Wesley Autrey, New York subway hero.

424
0:21:27.339,000 --> 0:21:3,000
Fifty-year-old African-American construction worker standing on a subway.

425
0:21:31.16,000 --> 0:21:32,000
A white guy falls on the tracks.

426
0:21:32.712,000 --> 0:21:34,000
The subway train is coming. There's 75 people there.

427
0:21:35.196,000 --> 0:21:36,000
You know what? They freeze.

428
0:21:36.716,000 --> 0:21:37,000
He's got a reason not to get involved.

429
0:21:38.606,000 --> 0:21:4,000
He's black, the guy's white, and he's got two kids.

430
0:21:41.047,000 --> 0:21:42,000
Instead, he gives his kids to a stranger,

431
0:21:43.024,000 --> 0:21:45,000
jumps on the tracks, puts the guy between the tracks,

432
0:21:45.525,000 --> 0:21:47,000
lays on him, the subway goes over him.

433
0:21:47.719,000 --> 0:21:5,000
Wesley and the guy -- 20 and a half inches height.

434
0:21:51.001,000 --> 0:21:53,000
The train clearance is 21 inches.

435
0:21:53.84,000 --> 0:21:55,000
A half an inch would have taken his head off.

436
0:21:56.537,000 --> 0:22:,000
And he said, "I did what anyone could do," no big deal to jump on the tracks.

437
0:22:00.63,000 --> 0:22:03,000
And the moral imperative is "I did what everyone should do."

438
0:22:04.302,000 --> 0:22:06,000
And so one day, you will be in a new situation.

439
0:22:07.16,000 --> 0:22:09,000
Take path one, you're going to be a perpetrator of evil.

440
0:22:09.804,000 --> 0:22:11,000
Evil, meaning you're going to be Arthur Andersen.

441
0:22:12.16,000 --> 0:22:14,000
You're going to cheat, or you're going to allow bullying.

442
0:22:14.899,000 --> 0:22:16,000
Path two, you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction.

443
0:22:17.737,000 --> 0:22:18,000
Path three, you become a hero.

444
0:22:19.484,000 --> 0:22:23,000
The point is, are we ready to take the path to celebrating ordinary heroes,

445
0:22:23.926,000 --> 0:22:25,000
waiting for the right situation to come along

446
0:22:26.154,000 --> 0:22:28,000
to put heroic imagination into action?

447
0:22:28.244,000 --> 0:22:3,000
Because it may only happen once in your life,

448
0:22:31.062,000 --> 0:22:33,000
and when you pass it by, you'll always know,

449
0:22:33.229,000 --> 0:22:35,000
I could have been a hero and I let it pass me by.

450
0:22:35.688,000 --> 0:22:37,000
So the point is thinking it and then doing it.

451
0:22:38.559,000 --> 0:22:39,000
So I want to thank you. Thank you.

452
0:22:40.531,000 --> 0:22:43,000
Let's oppose the power of evil systems at home and abroad,

453
0:22:43.557,000 --> 0:22:44,000
and let's focus on the positive.

454
0:22:45.16,000 --> 0:22:48,000
Advocate for respect of personal dignity, for justice and peace,

455
0:22:48.705,000 --> 0:22:5,000
which sadly our administration has not been doing.

456

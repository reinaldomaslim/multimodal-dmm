2
0:00:15.641,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Let me tell you, it has been a fantastic month for deception.

3
0:00:19.354,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And I'm not even talking about the American presidential race. (Laughter)

4
0:00:23.607,000 --> 0:00:27,000
We have a high-profile journalist caught for plagiarism,

5
0:00:27.942,000 --> 0:00:29,000
a young superstar writer whose book involves

6
0:00:30.874,000 --> 0:00:33,000
so many made up quotes that they've pulled it from the shelves;

7
0:00:34.179,000 --> 0:00:36,000
a New York Times exposé on fake book reviews.

8
0:00:36.777,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It's been fantastic.

9
0:00:38.186,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now, of course, not all deception hits the news.

10
0:00:42.037,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Much of the deception is everyday. In fact, a lot of research

11
0:00:45.716,000 --> 0:00:49,000
shows that we all lie once or twice a day, as Dave suggested.

12
0:00:50.047,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So it's about 6:30 now, suggests that most of us should have lied.

13
0:00:52.98,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Let's take a look at Winnipeg. How many of you,

14
0:00:54.88,000 --> 0:00:56,000
in the last 24 hours -- think back -- have told a little fib,

15
0:00:57.807,000 --> 0:01:,000
or a big one? How many have told a little lie out there?

16
0:01:01.358,000 --> 0:01:02,000
All right, good. These are all the liars.

17
0:01:03.262,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Make sure you pay attention to them. (Laughter)

18
0:01:06.555,000 --> 0:01:08,000
No, that looked good, it was about two thirds of you.

19
0:01:08.701,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The other third didn't lie, or perhaps forgot,

20
0:01:11.553,000 --> 0:01:13,000
or you're lying to me about your lying, which is very,

21
0:01:14.213,000 --> 0:01:18,000
very devious. (Laughter) This fits with a lot of the research,

22
0:01:18.263,000 --> 0:01:21,000
which suggests that lying is very pervasive.

23
0:01:21.617,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It's this pervasiveness, combined with the centrality

24
0:01:25.578,000 --> 0:01:27,000
to what it means to be a human, the fact that we can

25
0:01:28.018,000 --> 0:01:29,000
tell the truth or make something up,

26
0:01:29.898,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that has fascinated people throughout history.

27
0:01:32.749,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Here we have Diogenes with his lantern.

28
0:01:35.378,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Does anybody know what he was looking for?

29
0:01:38.058,000 --> 0:01:41,000
A single honest man, and he died without finding one

30
0:01:41.842,000 --> 0:01:44,000
back in Greece. And we have Confucius in the East

31
0:01:44.859,000 --> 0:01:46,000
who was really concerned with sincerity,

32
0:01:47.236,000 --> 0:01:5,000
not only that you walked the walk or talked the talk,

33
0:01:50.32,000 --> 0:01:53,000
but that you believed in what you were doing.

34
0:01:53.474,000 --> 0:01:55,000
You believed in your principles.

35
0:01:55.48,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Now my first professional encounter with deception

36
0:01:58.411,000 --> 0:02:01,000
is a little bit later than these guys, a couple thousand years.

37
0:02:01.874,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I was a customs officer for Canada back in the mid-'90s.

38
0:02:05.673,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Yeah. I was defending Canada's borders.

39
0:02:08.499,000 --> 0:02:11,000
You may think that's a weapon right there. In fact,

40
0:02:12.281,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that's a stamp. I used a stamp to defend Canada's borders. (Laughter)

41
0:02:17.311,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Very Canadian of me. I learned a lot about deception

42
0:02:20.848,000 --> 0:02:23,000
while doing my duty here in customs,

43
0:02:23.903,000 --> 0:02:25,000
one of which was that most of what I thought I knew about deception was wrong,

44
0:02:26.787,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and I'll tell you about some of that tonight.

45
0:02:28.539,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But even since just 1995, '96, the way we communicate

46
0:02:32.613,000 --> 0:02:35,000
has been completely transformed. We email, we text,

47
0:02:35.91,000 --> 0:02:37,000
we skype, we Facebook. It's insane.

48
0:02:38.523,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Almost every aspect of human communication's been changed,

49
0:02:41.784,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and of course that's had an impact on deception.

50
0:02:44.344,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions

51
0:02:46.927,000 --> 0:02:48,000
we've been tracking and documenting.

52
0:02:49.303,000 --> 0:02:53,000
They're called the Butler, the Sock Puppet

53
0:02:53.547,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and the Chinese Water Army.

54
0:02:55.628,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It sounds a little bit like a weird book,

55
0:02:57.525,000 --> 0:02:59,000
but actually they're all new types of lies.

56
0:02:59.658,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Let's start with the Butlers. Here's an example of one:

57
0:03:02.703,000 --> 0:03:05,000
"On my way." Anybody ever written, "On my way?"

58
0:03:05.816,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Then you've also lied. (Laughter)

59
0:03:09.579,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We're never on our way. We're thinking about going on our way.

60
0:03:13.776,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Here's another one: "Sorry I didn't respond to you earlier.

61
0:03:16.539,000 --> 0:03:17,000
My battery was dead." Your battery wasn't dead.

62
0:03:18.504,000 --> 0:03:19,000
You weren't in a dead zone.

63
0:03:20.38,000 --> 0:03:21,000
You just didn't want to respond to that person that time.

64
0:03:22.333,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Here's the last one: You're talking to somebody,

65
0:03:24.13,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and you say, "Sorry, got work, gotta go."

66
0:03:26.62,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But really, you're just bored. You want to talk to somebody else.

67
0:03:30.417,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Each of these is about a relationship,

68
0:03:32.833,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and this is a 24/7 connected world. Once you get my cell phone number,

69
0:03:37.238,000 --> 0:03:39,000
you can literally be in touch with me 24 hours a day.

70
0:03:40.203,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And so these lies are being used by people

71
0:03:42.572,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to create a buffer, like the butler used to do,

72
0:03:45.398,000 --> 0:03:48,000
between us and the connections to everybody else.

73
0:03:48.805,000 --> 0:03:49,000
But they're very special. They use ambiguity

74
0:03:50.512,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that comes from using technology. You don't know

75
0:03:52.573,000 --> 0:03:54,000
where I am or what I'm doing or who I'm with.

76
0:03:55.521,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And they're aimed at protecting the relationships.

77
0:03:58.012,000 --> 0:04:,000
These aren't just people being jerks. These are people

78
0:04:00.593,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that are saying, look, I don't want to talk to you now,

79
0:04:02.969,000 --> 0:04:04,000
or I didn't want to talk to you then, but I still care about you.

80
0:04:05.393,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Our relationship is still important.

81
0:04:07.793,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Now, the Sock Puppet, on the other hand,

82
0:04:09.307,000 --> 0:04:11,000
is a totally different animal. The sock puppet isn't

83
0:04:11.65,000 --> 0:04:14,000
about ambiguity, per se. It's about identity.

84
0:04:14.715,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Let me give you a very recent example,

85
0:04:16.717,000 --> 0:04:17,000
as in, like, last week.

86
0:04:18.231,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Here's R.J. Ellory, best-seller author in Britain.

87
0:04:21.499,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Here's one of his bestselling books.

88
0:04:23.519,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Here's a reviewer online, on Amazon.

89
0:04:26.932,000 --> 0:04:28,000
My favorite, by Nicodemus Jones, is,

90
0:04:29.589,000 --> 0:04:32,000
"Whatever else it might do, it will touch your soul."

91
0:04:33.397,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And of course, you might suspect

92
0:04:34.8,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that Nicodemus Jones is R.J. Ellory.

93
0:04:37.427,000 --> 0:04:41,000
He wrote very, very positive reviews about himself. Surprise, surprise.

94
0:04:42.114,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Now this Sock Puppet stuff isn't actually that new.

95
0:04:45.374,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Walt Whitman also did this back in the day,

96
0:04:48.541,000 --> 0:04:51,000
before there was Internet technology. Sock Puppet

97
0:04:51.596,000 --> 0:04:53,000
becomes interesting when we get to scale,

98
0:04:54.364,000 --> 0:04:56,000
which is the domain of the Chinese Water Army.

99
0:04:56.882,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Chinese Water Army refers to thousands of people

100
0:04:59.318,000 --> 0:05:02,000
in China that are paid small amounts of money

101
0:05:02.366,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to produce content. It could be reviews. It could be

102
0:05:05.4,000 --> 0:05:07,000
propaganda. The government hires these people,

103
0:05:07.959,000 --> 0:05:09,000
companies hire them, all over the place.

104
0:05:10.587,000 --> 0:05:13,000
In North America, we call this Astroturfing,

105
0:05:14.204,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and Astroturfing is very common now. There's a lot of concerns about it.

106
0:05:17.642,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We see this especially with product reviews, book reviews,

107
0:05:20.869,000 --> 0:05:24,000
everything from hotels to whether that toaster is a good toaster or not.

108
0:05:25.664,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Now, looking at these three reviews, or these three types of deception,

109
0:05:29.582,000 --> 0:05:31,000
you might think, wow, the Internet is really making us

110
0:05:32.319,000 --> 0:05:35,000
a deceptive species, especially when you think about

111
0:05:35.528,000 --> 0:05:39,000
the Astroturfing, where we can see deception brought up to scale.

112
0:05:40.13,000 --> 0:05:44,000
But actually, what I've been finding is very different from that.

113
0:05:44.868,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now, let's put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms,

114
0:05:48.117,000 --> 0:05:49,000
which I'm sure none of you have been in.

115
0:05:50.016,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I can assure you there's deception there.

116
0:05:52.345,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And let's put aside the Nigerian prince who's emailed you

117
0:05:55.054,000 --> 0:05:58,000
about getting the 43 million out of the country. (Laughter)

118
0:05:58.282,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Let's forget about that guy, too.

119
0:05:59.962,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Let's focus on the conversations between our friends

120
0:06:02.906,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones.

121
0:06:05.053,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Those are the conversations that really matter.

122
0:06:07.461,000 --> 0:06:11,000
What does technology do to deception with those folks?

123
0:06:11.701,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Here's a couple of studies. One of the studies we do

124
0:06:14.776,000 --> 0:06:17,000
are called diary studies, in which we ask people to record

125
0:06:18.147,000 --> 0:06:21,000
all of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days,

126
0:06:21.713,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place

127
0:06:24.818,000 --> 0:06:26,000
per conversation within a medium, and the finding

128
0:06:27.766,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that we get that surprises people the most is that email

129
0:06:30.29,000 --> 0:06:33,000
is the most honest of those three media.

130
0:06:33.569,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And it really throws people for a loop because we think,

131
0:06:35.97,000 --> 0:06:38,000
well, there's no nonverbal cues, so why don't you lie more?

132
0:06:39.706,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The phone, in contrast, the most lies.

133
0:06:44.01,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Again and again and again we see the phone is the device

134
0:06:45.956,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that people lie on the most, and perhaps because of the Butler Lie ambiguities I was telling you about.

135
0:06:50.674,000 --> 0:06:53,000
This tends to be very different from what people expect.

136
0:06:54.649,000 --> 0:06:57,000
What about résumés? We did a study in which we had

137
0:06:57.873,000 --> 0:06:59,000
people apply for a job, and they could apply for a job

138
0:07:00.417,000 --> 0:07:03,000
either with a traditional paper résumé, or on LinkedIn,

139
0:07:03.931,000 --> 0:07:05,000
which is a social networking site like Facebook,

140
0:07:06.753,000 --> 0:07:09,000
but for professionals -- involves the same information as a résumé.

141
0:07:10.32,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And what we found, to many people's surprise,

142
0:07:12.934,000 --> 0:07:14,000
was that those LinkedIn résumés were more honest

143
0:07:15.729,000 --> 0:07:16,000
on the things that mattered to employers, like your

144
0:07:17.553,000 --> 0:07:21,000
responsibilities or your skills at your previous job.

145
0:07:21.704,000 --> 0:07:23,000
How about Facebook itself?

146
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:25,000
You know, we always think that hey, there are these

147
0:07:25.882,000 --> 0:07:27,000
idealized versions, people are just showing the best things

148
0:07:28.011,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that happened in their lives. I've thought that many times.

149
0:07:30.667,000 --> 0:07:33,000
My friends, no way they can be that cool and have good of a life.

150
0:07:33.735,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Well, one study tested this by examining people's personalities.

151
0:07:37.556,000 --> 0:07:41,000
They had four good friends of a person judge their personality.

152
0:07:41.774,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Then they had strangers, many strangers,

153
0:07:43.73,000 --> 0:07:45,000
judge the person's personality just from Facebook,

154
0:07:46.258,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and what they found was those judgments of the personality

155
0:07:48.687,000 --> 0:07:5,000
were pretty much identical, highly correlated,

156
0:07:51.196,000 --> 0:07:55,000
meaning that Facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality.

157
0:07:55.569,000 --> 0:07:57,000
All right, well, what about online dating?

158
0:07:58.141,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I mean, that's a pretty deceptive space.

159
0:07:59.641,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I'm sure you all have "friends" that have used online dating. (Laughter)

160
0:08:03.176,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And they would tell you about that guy that had no hair

161
0:08:05.234,000 --> 0:08:08,000
when he came, or the woman that didn't look at all like her photo.

162
0:08:08.264,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Well, we were really interested in it, and so what we did

163
0:08:11.4,000 --> 0:08:14,000
is we brought people, online daters, into the lab,

164
0:08:14.507,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and then we measured them. We got their height

165
0:08:15.987,000 --> 0:08:18,000
up against the wall, we put them on a scale, got their weight --

166
0:08:19.868,000 --> 0:08:22,000
ladies loved that -- and then we actually got their driver's license to get their age.

167
0:08:23.763,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And what we found was very, very interesting.

168
0:08:28.074,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Here's an example of the men and the height.

169
0:08:32.003,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile.

170
0:08:34.473,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Along the y-axis, the vertical axis, is how tall they actually were.

171
0:08:39.335,000 --> 0:08:42,000
That diagonal line is the truth line. If their dot's on it,

172
0:08:42.411,000 --> 0:08:43,000
they were telling exactly the truth.

173
0:08:43.965,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Now, as you see, most of the little dots are below the line.

174
0:08:47.078,000 --> 0:08:49,000
What it means is all the guys were lying about their height.

175
0:08:49.945,000 --> 0:08:51,000
In fact, they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch,

176
0:08:52.886,000 --> 0:08:58,000
what we say in the lab as "strong rounding up." (Laughter)

177
0:08:59.162,000 --> 0:09:03,000
You get to 5'8" and one tenth, and boom! 5'9".

178
0:09:03.665,000 --> 0:09:04,000
But what's really important here is, look at all those dots.

179
0:09:05.663,000 --> 0:09:07,000
They are clustering pretty close to the truth. What we found

180
0:09:08.229,000 --> 0:09:1,000
was 80 percent of our participants did indeed lie

181
0:09:10.637,000 --> 0:09:13,000
on one of those dimensions, but they always lied by a little bit.

182
0:09:14.232,000 --> 0:09:17,000
One of the reasons is pretty simple. If you go to a date,

183
0:09:17.256,000 --> 0:09:2,000
a coffee date, and you're completely different than what you said,

184
0:09:20.857,000 --> 0:09:23,000
game over. Right? So people lied frequently, but they lied

185
0:09:24.476,000 --> 0:09:27,000
subtly, not too much. They were constrained.

186
0:09:27.945,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Well, what explains all these studies? What explains the fact

187
0:09:30.832,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that despite our intuitions, mine included,

188
0:09:35.467,000 --> 0:09:38,000
a lot of online communication, technologically-mediated

189
0:09:38.996,000 --> 0:09:42,000
communication, is more honest than face to face?

190
0:09:43.024,000 --> 0:09:45,000
That really is strange. How do we explain this?

191
0:09:45.513,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Well, to do that, one thing is we can look at the deception-detection literature.

192
0:09:48.892,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It's a very old literature by now, it's coming up on 50 years.

193
0:09:53.237,000 --> 0:09:55,000
It's been reviewed many times. There's been thousands of trials,

194
0:09:55.899,000 --> 0:09:58,000
hundreds of studies, and there's some really compelling findings.

195
0:09:59.88,000 --> 0:10:02,000
The first is, we're really bad at detecting deception,

196
0:10:03.116,000 --> 0:10:07,000
really bad. Fifty-four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell

197
0:10:07.232,000 --> 0:10:1,000
if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not.

198
0:10:10.616,000 --> 0:10:13,000
That's really bad. Why is it so bad?

199
0:10:13.808,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Well it has to do with Pinocchio's nose.

200
0:10:16.338,000 --> 0:10:18,000
If I were to ask you guys, what do you rely on

201
0:10:18.697,000 --> 0:10:2,000
when you're looking at somebody and you want to find out

202
0:10:20.942,000 --> 0:10:22,000
if they're lying? What cue do you pay attention to?

203
0:10:23.872,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Most of you would say that one of the cues you look at

204
0:10:26.302,000 --> 0:10:28,000
is the eyes. The eyes are the window to the soul.

205
0:10:29.03,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And you're not alone. Around the world, almost every culture,

206
0:10:31.433,000 --> 0:10:33,000
one of the top cues is eyes. But the research

207
0:10:34.296,000 --> 0:10:37,000
over the last 50 years says there's actually no reliable cue

208
0:10:38.12,000 --> 0:10:4,000
to deception, which blew me away, and it's one of

209
0:10:41.117,000 --> 0:10:43,000
the hard lessons that I learned when I was customs officer.

210
0:10:43.472,000 --> 0:10:45,000
The eyes do not tell us whether somebody's lying or not.

211
0:10:45.902,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Some situations, yes -- high stakes, maybe their pupils dilate,

212
0:10:48.92,000 --> 0:10:51,000
their pitch goes up, their body movements change a little bit,

213
0:10:52.424,000 --> 0:10:56,000
but not all the time, not for everybody, it's not reliable.

214
0:10:57.256,000 --> 0:11:,000
Strange. The other thing is that just because you can't see me

215
0:11:00.634,000 --> 0:11:02,000
doesn't mean I'm going to lie. It's common sense,

216
0:11:03.053,000 --> 0:11:05,000
but one important finding is that we lie for a reason.

217
0:11:05.96,000 --> 0:11:07,000
We lie to protect ourselves or for our own gain

218
0:11:08.327,000 --> 0:11:1,000
or for somebody else's gain.

219
0:11:11.154,000 --> 0:11:12,000
So there are some pathological liars, but they make up

220
0:11:13.084,000 --> 0:11:16,000
a tiny portion of the population. We lie for a reason.

221
0:11:16.597,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Just because people can't see us doesn't mean

222
0:11:18.228,000 --> 0:11:2,000
we're going to necessarily lie.

223
0:11:20.499,000 --> 0:11:21,000
But I think there's actually something much more

224
0:11:22.052,000 --> 0:11:25,000
interesting and fundamental going on here. The next big

225
0:11:25.326,000 --> 0:11:28,000
thing for me, the next big idea, we can find by going

226
0:11:29.123,000 --> 0:11:32,000
way back in history to the origins of language.

227
0:11:32.262,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Most linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere

228
0:11:36.149,000 --> 0:11:39,000
between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. That's a long time ago.

229
0:11:39.317,000 --> 0:11:41,000
A lot of humans have lived since then.

230
0:11:41.933,000 --> 0:11:43,000
We've been talking, I guess, about fires and caves

231
0:11:44.356,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and saber-toothed tigers. I don't know what they talked about,

232
0:11:47.463,000 --> 0:11:49,000
but they were doing a lot of talking, and like I said,

233
0:11:49.981,000 --> 0:11:51,000
there's a lot of humans evolving speaking,

234
0:11:52.526,000 --> 0:11:54,000
about 100 billion people in fact.

235
0:11:55.332,000 --> 0:11:57,000
What's important though is that writing only emerged

236
0:11:58.114,000 --> 0:12:01,000
about 5,000 years ago. So what that means is that

237
0:12:01.701,000 --> 0:12:03,000
all the people before there was any writing,

238
0:12:04.093,000 --> 0:12:09,000
every word that they ever said, every utterance

239
0:12:09.679,000 --> 0:12:13,000
disappeared. No trace. Evanescent. Gone.

240
0:12:14.431,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So we've been evolving to talk in a way in which

241
0:12:18.496,000 --> 0:12:23,000
there is no record. In fact, even the next big change

242
0:12:24.413,000 --> 0:12:26,000
to writing was only 500 years ago now,

243
0:12:26.881,000 --> 0:12:28,000
with the printing press, which is very recent in our past,

244
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until World War II,

245
0:12:33.502,000 --> 0:12:36,000
so even the people of the last two millennia,

246
0:12:36.886,000 --> 0:12:41,000
most of the words they ever said -- poof! -- disappeared.

247
0:12:41.918,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Let's turn to now, the networked age.

248
0:12:45.509,000 --> 0:12:49,000
How many of you have recorded something today?

249
0:12:50.221,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Anybody do any writing today? Did anybody write a word?

250
0:12:53.398,000 --> 0:12:57,000
It looks like almost every single person here recorded something.

251
0:12:57.624,000 --> 0:13:,000
In this room, right now, we've probably recorded more

252
0:13:00.672,000 --> 0:13:04,000
than almost all of human pre-ancient history.

253
0:13:05.214,000 --> 0:13:08,000
That is crazy. We're entering this amazing period

254
0:13:08.444,000 --> 0:13:12,000
of flux in human evolution where we've evolved to speak

255
0:13:12.459,000 --> 0:13:14,000
in a way in which our words disappear, but we're in

256
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
an environment where we're recording everything.

257
0:13:18.063,000 --> 0:13:2,000
In fact, I think in the very near future, it's not just

258
0:13:20.4,000 --> 0:13:22,000
what we write that will be recorded, everything we do

259
0:13:22.749,000 --> 0:13:24,000
will be recorded.

260
0:13:25.082,000 --> 0:13:29,000
What does that mean? What's the next big idea from that?

261
0:13:29.538,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Well, as a social scientist, this is the most amazing thing

262
0:13:33.788,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I have ever even dreamed of. Now, I can look at

263
0:13:37.335,000 --> 0:13:4,000
all those words that used to, for millennia, disappear.

264
0:13:40.946,000 --> 0:13:44,000
I can look at lies that before were said and then gone.

265
0:13:45.194,000 --> 0:13:48,000
You remember those Astroturfing reviews that we were

266
0:13:48.714,000 --> 0:13:51,000
talking about before? Well, when they write a fake review,

267
0:13:52.217,000 --> 0:13:54,000
they have to post it somewhere, and it's left behind for us.

268
0:13:54.921,000 --> 0:13:56,000
So one thing that we did, and I'll give you an example of

269
0:13:57.356,000 --> 0:13:59,000
looking at the language, is we paid people

270
0:13:59.851,000 --> 0:14:02,000
to write some fake reviews. One of these reviews is fake.

271
0:14:03.386,000 --> 0:14:04,000
The person never was at the James Hotel.

272
0:14:05.329,000 --> 0:14:07,000
The other review is real. The person stayed there.

273
0:14:08.251,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Now, your task now is to decide

274
0:14:11.778,000 --> 0:14:15,000
which review is fake?

275
0:14:15.851,000 --> 0:14:19,000
I'll give you a moment to read through them.

276
0:14:20.037,000 --> 0:14:22,000
But I want everybody to raise their hand at some point.

277
0:14:22.324,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Remember, I study deception. I can tell if you don't raise your hand.

278
0:14:26.555,000 --> 0:14:3,000
All right, how many of you believe that A is the fake?

279
0:14:33.154,000 --> 0:14:35,000
All right. Very good. About half.

280
0:14:35.296,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And how many of you think that B is?

281
0:14:38.911,000 --> 0:14:4,000
All right. Slightly more for B.

282
0:14:41.44,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Excellent. Here's the answer.

283
0:14:44.032,000 --> 0:14:5,000
B is a fake. Well done second group. You dominated the first group. (Laughter)

284
0:14:50.613,000 --> 0:14:52,000
You're actually a little bit unusual. Every time we demonstrate this,

285
0:14:53.459,000 --> 0:14:55,000
it's usually about a 50-50 split, which fits

286
0:14:56.205,000 --> 0:14:58,000
with the research, 54 percent. Maybe people here

287
0:14:58.851,000 --> 0:15:01,000
in Winnipeg are more suspicious and better at figuring it out.

288
0:15:02.621,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Those cold, hard winters, I love it.

289
0:15:05.309,000 --> 0:15:08,000
All right, so why do I care about this?

290
0:15:08.363,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Well, what I can do now with my colleagues in computer science

291
0:15:11.631,000 --> 0:15:14,000
is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze

292
0:15:14.863,000 --> 0:15:16,000
the linguistic traces of deception.

293
0:15:17.763,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Let me highlight a couple of things here

294
0:15:19.596,000 --> 0:15:22,000
in the fake review. The first is that liars tend to think

295
0:15:23.039,000 --> 0:15:24,000
about narrative. They make up a story:

296
0:15:24.627,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Who? And what happened? And that's what happened here.

297
0:15:27.813,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Our fake reviewers talked about who they were with

298
0:15:30.102,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and what they were doing. They also used the first person singular, I,

299
0:15:34.867,000 --> 0:15:36,000
way more than the people that actually stayed there.

300
0:15:37.336,000 --> 0:15:41,000
They were inserting themselves into the hotel review,

301
0:15:42.032,000 --> 0:15:43,000
kind of trying to convince you they were there.

302
0:15:43.728,000 --> 0:15:47,000
In contrast, the people that wrote the reviews that were actually there,

303
0:15:47.743,000 --> 0:15:49,000
their bodies actually entered the physical space,

304
0:15:50.175,000 --> 0:15:52,000
they talked a lot more about spatial information.

305
0:15:53.074,000 --> 0:15:55,000
They said how big the bathroom was, or they said,

306
0:15:55.591,000 --> 0:15:59,000
you know, here's how far shopping is from the hotel.

307
0:16:00.111,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Now, you guys did pretty well. Most people perform at chance at this task.

308
0:16:04.272,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Our computer algorithm is very accurate, much more accurate

309
0:16:07.03,000 --> 0:16:1,000
than humans can be, and it's not going to be accurate all the time.

310
0:16:10.321,000 --> 0:16:12,000
This isn't a deception-detection machine to tell

311
0:16:12.351,000 --> 0:16:14,000
if your girlfriend's lying to you on text messaging.

312
0:16:14.852,000 --> 0:16:17,000
We believe that every lie now, every type of lie --

313
0:16:18.416,000 --> 0:16:21,000
fake hotel reviews, fake shoe reviews,

314
0:16:22.203,000 --> 0:16:24,000
your girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging --

315
0:16:25.117,000 --> 0:16:26,000
those are all different lies. They're going to have

316
0:16:26.622,000 --> 0:16:28,000
different patterns of language. But because everything's

317
0:16:29.481,000 --> 0:16:33,000
recorded now, we can look at all of those kinds of lies.

318
0:16:34.17,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Now, as I said, as a social scientist, this is wonderful.

319
0:16:38.163,000 --> 0:16:4,000
It's transformational. We're going to be able to learn

320
0:16:40.25,000 --> 0:16:43,000
so much more about human thought and expression,

321
0:16:44.052,000 --> 0:16:48,000
about everything from love to attitudes,

322
0:16:48.45,000 --> 0:16:49,000
because everything is being recorded now, but

323
0:16:50.41,000 --> 0:16:52,000
what does it mean for the average citizen?

324
0:16:52.814,000 --> 0:16:54,000
What does it mean for us in our lives?

325
0:16:55.616,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Well, let's forget deception for a bit. One of the big ideas,

326
0:16:59.289,000 --> 0:17:02,000
I believe, is that we're leaving these huge traces behind.

327
0:17:02.977,000 --> 0:17:05,000
My outbox for email is massive,

328
0:17:06.193,000 --> 0:17:09,000
and I never look at it. I write all the time,

329
0:17:09.53,000 --> 0:17:12,000
but I never look at my record, at my trace.

330
0:17:12.968,000 --> 0:17:13,000
And I think we're going to see a lot more of that,

331
0:17:14.535,000 --> 0:17:17,000
where we can reflect on who we are by looking at

332
0:17:17.696,000 --> 0:17:2,000
what we wrote, what we said, what we did.

333
0:17:21.314,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Now, if we bring it back to deception, there's a couple

334
0:17:23.586,000 --> 0:17:24,000
of take-away things here.

335
0:17:25.563,000 --> 0:17:29,000
First, lying online can be very dangerous, right?

336
0:17:30.051,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine,

337
0:17:32.757,000 --> 0:17:36,000
but you're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to,

338
0:17:37.032,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and you're also leaving them around for me to analyze

339
0:17:38.792,000 --> 0:17:39,000
with some computer algorithms.

340
0:17:40.246,000 --> 0:17:43,000
So by all means, go ahead and do that, that's good.

341
0:17:43.419,000 --> 0:17:47,000
But when it comes to lying and what we want to do

342
0:17:47.573,000 --> 0:17:49,000
with our lives, I think we can go back to

343
0:17:50.126,000 --> 0:17:53,000
Diogenes and Confucius. And they were less concerned

344
0:17:53.875,000 --> 0:17:55,000
about whether to lie or not to lie, and more concerned about

345
0:17:56.707,000 --> 0:17:59,000
being true to the self, and I think this is really important.

346
0:17:59.992,000 --> 0:18:03,000
Now, when you are about to say or do something,

347
0:18:04.175,000 --> 0:18:08,000
we can think, do I want this to be part of my legacy,

348
0:18:08.735,000 --> 0:18:1,000
part of my personal record?

349
0:18:11.448,000 --> 0:18:13,000
Because in the digital age we live in now,

350
0:18:14.105,000 --> 0:18:18,000
in the networked age, we are all leaving a record.

351
0:18:18.569,000 --> 0:18:19,000
Thank you so much for your time,

352
0:18:20.264,000 --> 0:18:24,000
and good luck with your record. (Applause)

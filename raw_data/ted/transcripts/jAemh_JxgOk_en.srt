1
0:00:13.8,000 --> 0:00:15,000
When I was a kid, my parents would tell me,

2
0:00:16.64,000 --> 0:00:19,000
"You can make a mess, but you have to clean up after yourself."

3
0:00:20.44,000 --> 0:00:23,000
So freedom came with responsibility.

4
0:00:23.8,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But my imagination would take me to all these wonderful places,

5
0:00:27.4,000 --> 0:00:29,000
where everything was possible.

6
0:00:29.52,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence --

7
0:00:32.44,000 --> 0:00:34,000
or a bubble of ignorance, I should say,

8
0:00:34.8,000 --> 0:00:39,000
because adults would lie to us to protect us from the ugly truth.

9
0:00:39.92,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And growing up, I found out that adults make a mess,

10
0:00:43.52,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and they're not very good at cleaning up after themselves.

11
0:00:47.36,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Fast forward, I am an adult now,

12
0:00:49.52,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and I teach citizen science and invention at the Hong Kong Harbour School.

13
0:00:54.52,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And it doesn't take too long

14
0:00:55.88,000 --> 0:00:59,000
before my students walk on a beach and stumble upon piles of trash.

15
0:01:00.12,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So as good citizens, we clean up the beaches --

16
0:01:02.8,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and no, he is not drinking alcohol, and if he is, I did not give it to him.

17
0:01:07.88,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:09.96,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And so it's sad to say,

19
0:01:11.2,000 --> 0:01:14,000
but today more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic in them.

20
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It's a horrifying fact.

21
0:01:16.8,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And in past decades,

22
0:01:18.2,000 --> 0:01:21,000
we've been taking those big ships out and those big nets,

23
0:01:21.68,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and we collect those plastic bits that we look at under a microscope,

24
0:01:25.04,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and we sort them,

25
0:01:26.28,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and then we put this data onto a map.

26
0:01:28.44,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But that takes forever, it's very expensive,

27
0:01:30.8,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and so it's quite risky to take those big boats out.

28
0:01:33.96,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So with my students, ages six to 15,

29
0:01:36.92,000 --> 0:01:38,000
we've been dreaming of inventing a better way.

30
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So we've transformed our tiny Hong Kong classroom into a workshop.

31
0:01:43.6,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And so we started building this small workbench,

32
0:01:46.28,000 --> 0:01:49,000
with different heights, so even really short kids can participate.

33
0:01:49.48,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And let me tell you, kids with power tools are awesome and safe.

34
0:01:53.68,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:55.04,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Not really.

36
0:01:56.96,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And so, back to plastic.

37
0:01:58.2,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We collect this plastic and we grind it to the size we find it in the ocean,

38
0:02:01.84,000 --> 0:02:03,000
which is very small because it breaks down.

39
0:02:04.04,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And so this is how we work.

40
0:02:05.44,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I let the imaginations of my students run wild.

41
0:02:08.6,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And my job is to try to collect the best of each kid's idea

42
0:02:12.88,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and try to combine it into something that hopefully would work.

43
0:02:17.92,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits,

44
0:02:21.08,000 --> 0:02:22,000
we are going to collect only the data.

45
0:02:23.08,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So we're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot --

46
0:02:26.08,000 --> 0:02:28,000
so robots, kids get very excited.

47
0:02:28.48,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And the next thing we do -- we do what we call "rapid prototyping."

48
0:02:31.647,000 --> 0:02:32,000
We are so rapid at prototyping

49
0:02:33.36,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that the lunch is still in the lunchbox when we're hacking it.

50
0:02:36.56,000 --> 0:02:37,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:37.88,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And we hack table lamps and webcams, into plumbing fixtures

52
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and we assemble that into a floating robot that will be slowly moving through water

53
0:02:47.32,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and through the plastic that we have there --

54
0:02:49.44,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and this is the image that we get in the robot.

55
0:02:51.655,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So we see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor,

56
0:02:55.4,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and the computer on board will process this image,

57
0:02:58.72,000 --> 0:03:,000
and measure the size of each particle,

58
0:03:00.84,000 --> 0:03:04,000
so we have a rough estimate of how much plastic there is in the water.

59
0:03:05.52,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So we documented this invention step by step

60
0:03:08.56,000 --> 0:03:11,000
on a website for inventors called Instructables,

61
0:03:11.96,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in the hope that somebody would make it even better.

62
0:03:15.838,000 --> 0:03:18,000
What was really cool about this project was that the students saw a local problem,

63
0:03:19.72,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and boom -- they are trying to immediately address it.

64
0:03:22.411,000 --> 0:03:24,000
[I can investigate my local problem]

65
0:03:24.76,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But my students in Hong Kong are hyperconnected kids.

66
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And they watch the news, they watch the Internet,

67
0:03:30.32,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and they came across this image.

68
0:03:33.84,000 --> 0:03:37,000
This was a child, probably under 10, cleaning up an oil spill bare-handed,

69
0:03:38.6,000 --> 0:03:42,000
in the Sundarbans, which is the world's largest mangrove forest in Bangladesh.

70
0:03:43.12,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So they were very shocked,

71
0:03:45.6,000 --> 0:03:48,000
because this is the water they drink, this is the water they bathe in,

72
0:03:48.92,000 --> 0:03:51,000
this is the water they fish in -- this is the place where they live.

73
0:03:52.32,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And also you can see the water is brown, the mud is brown and oil is brown,

74
0:03:56.24,000 --> 0:03:57,000
so when everything is mixed up,

75
0:03:57.741,000 --> 0:03:59,000
it's really hard to see what's in the water.

76
0:04:00.24,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But, there's a technology that's rather simple,

77
0:04:02.52,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that's called spectrometry,

78
0:04:04.08,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that allows you see what's in the water.

79
0:04:06.009,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So we built a rough prototype of a spectrometer,

80
0:04:09.08,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and you can shine light through different substances

81
0:04:12.04,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that produce different spectrums,

82
0:04:14.48,000 --> 0:04:17,000
so that can help you identify what's in the water.

83
0:04:18.36,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So we packed this prototype of a sensor,

84
0:04:21.28,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and we shipped it to Bangladesh.

85
0:04:23.989,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So what was cool about this project

86
0:04:25.68,000 --> 0:04:28,000
was that beyond addressing a local problem,

87
0:04:28.839,000 --> 0:04:29,000
or looking at a local problem,

88
0:04:30.293,000 --> 0:04:33,000
my students used their empathy and their sense of being creative

89
0:04:34.24,000 --> 0:04:36,000
to help, remotely, other kids.

90
0:04:36.52,000 --> 0:04:37,000
[I can investigate a remote problem]

91
0:04:38.259,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So I was very compelled by doing the second experiments,

92
0:04:40.903,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and I wanted to take it even further --

93
0:04:43.44,000 --> 0:04:47,000
maybe addressing an even harder problem, and it's also closer to my heart.

94
0:04:48.56,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So I'm half Japanese and half French,

95
0:04:51.2,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and maybe you remember in 2011 there was a massive earthquake in Japan.

96
0:04:57.12,000 --> 0:05:,000
It was so violent that it triggered several giant waves --

97
0:05:00.96,000 --> 0:05:01,000
they are called tsunami --

98
0:05:02.4,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and those tsunami destroyed many cities on the eastern coast of Japan.

99
0:05:10.68,000 --> 0:05:13,000
More than 14,000 people died in an instant.

100
0:05:15.6,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Also, it damaged the nuclear power plant of Fukushima,

101
0:05:19.36,000 --> 0:05:21,000
the nuclear power plant just by the water.

102
0:05:22.48,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And today, I read the reports

103
0:05:24.92,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and an average of 300 tons

104
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:31,000
are leaking from the nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean.

105
0:05:31.6,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And today the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of contamination of cesium-137.

106
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:42,000
If you go outside on the West Coast, you can measure Fukushima everywhere.

107
0:05:42.44,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But if you look at the map, it can look like most of the radioactivity

108
0:05:45.76,000 --> 0:05:47,000
has been washed away from the Japanese coast,

109
0:05:47.88,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and most of it is now -- it looks like it's safe, it's blue.

110
0:05:50.72,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Well, reality is a bit more complicated than this.

111
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So I've been going to Fukushima every year since the accident,

112
0:05:57.84,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and I measure independently and with other scientists,

113
0:06:00.4,000 --> 0:06:01,000
on land, in the river --

114
0:06:02.28,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and this time we wanted to take the kids.

115
0:06:05.04,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So of course we didn't take the kids, the parents wouldn't allow that to happen.

116
0:06:08.84,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Laughter)

117
0:06:10.2,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But every night we would report to "Mission Control" --

118
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
different masks they're wearing.

119
0:06:16.36,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It could look like they didn't take the work seriously, but they really did

120
0:06:20.76,000 --> 0:06:24,000
because they're going to have to live with radioactivity their whole life.

121
0:06:25.64,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And so what we did with them

122
0:06:27.72,000 --> 0:06:29,000
is that we'd discuss the data we collected that day,

123
0:06:30.36,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and talk about where we should be going next --

124
0:06:32.575,000 --> 0:06:34,000
strategy, itinerary, etc...

125
0:06:34.72,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And to do this, we built a very rough topographical map

126
0:06:38.36,000 --> 0:06:4,000
of the region around the nuclear power plant.

127
0:06:41.24,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And so we built the elevation map,

128
0:06:43.28,000 --> 0:06:47,000
we sprinkled pigments to represent real-time data for radioactivity,

129
0:06:47.92,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and we sprayed water to simulate the rainfall.

130
0:06:52.28,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And with this we could see that the radioactive dust

131
0:06:55.28,000 --> 0:06:58,000
was washing from the top of the mountain into the river system,

132
0:06:58.36,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and leaking into the ocean.

133
0:06:59.92,000 --> 0:07:,000
So it was a rough estimate.

134
0:07:02.68,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But with this in mind, we organized this expedition,

135
0:07:05.64,000 --> 0:07:08,000
which was the closest civilians have been to the nuclear power plant.

136
0:07:09.28,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We are sailing 1.5 kilometers away from the nuclear power plant,

137
0:07:13.64,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and with the help of the local fisherman,

138
0:07:15.617,000 --> 0:07:17,000
we are collecting sediment from the seabed

139
0:07:17.88,000 --> 0:07:2,000
with a custom sediment sampler we've invented and built.

140
0:07:21.36,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We pack the sediment into small bags,

141
0:07:24.64,000 --> 0:07:26,000
we then dispatch them to hundreds of small bags

142
0:07:26.92,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that we send to different universities,

143
0:07:28.88,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and we produce the map of the seabed radioactivity,

144
0:07:31.88,000 --> 0:07:33,000
especially in estuaries where the fish will reproduce,

145
0:07:34.44,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and I will hope that we will have improved

146
0:07:36.52,000 --> 0:07:39,000
the safety of the local fishermen and of your favorite sushi.

147
0:07:39.64,000 --> 0:07:4,000
(Laughter)

148
0:07:40.96,000 --> 0:07:41,000
You can see a progression here --

149
0:07:42.56,000 --> 0:07:46,000
we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.

150
0:07:47.12,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And it's been super exciting to work at these different scales,

151
0:07:50.097,000 --> 0:07:53,000
with also very simple, open-source technologies.

152
0:07:53.68,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating

153
0:07:57.04,000 --> 0:08:,000
because we have only started to measure the damage that we have done.

154
0:08:00.76,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We haven't even started to try to solve the problems.

155
0:08:05.64,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And so I wonder if we should just take a leap

156
0:08:08.44,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and try to invent better ways to do all these things.

157
0:08:13.52,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And so the classroom started to feel a little bit small,

158
0:08:17.12,000 --> 0:08:19,000
so we found an industrial site in Hong Kong,

159
0:08:19.84,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and we turned it into the largest mega-space

160
0:08:23.12,000 --> 0:08:26,000
focused on social and environmental impact.

161
0:08:26.32,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It's in central Hong Kong,

162
0:08:27.64,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and it's a place we can work with wood, metal, chemistry,

163
0:08:30.88,000 --> 0:08:31,000
a bit of biology, a bit of optics,

164
0:08:32.53,000 --> 0:08:34,000
basically you can build pretty much everything there.

165
0:08:35.047,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And its a place where adults and kids can play together.

166
0:08:38.04,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It's a place where kids' dreams can come true,

167
0:08:41.64,000 --> 0:08:42,000
with the help of adults,

168
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and where adults can be kids again.

169
0:08:44.84,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Student: Acceleration! Acceleration!

170
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Cesar Harada: We're asking questions such as,

171
0:08:50.159,000 --> 0:08:52,000
can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?

172
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:54,000
For example.

173
0:08:55.32,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Or, can we help the mobility of the aging population

174
0:08:59.64,000 --> 0:09:03,000
by transforming very standard wheelchairs into cool, electric vehicles?

175
0:09:05.24,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So plastic, oil and radioactivity are horrible, horrible legacies,

176
0:09:11.8,000 --> 0:09:15,000
but the very worst legacy that we can leave our children is lies.

177
0:09:16.76,000 --> 0:09:21,000
We can no longer afford to shield the kids from the ugly truth

178
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:25,000
because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.

179
0:09:26.72,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So citizen scientists, makers, dreamers --

180
0:09:31.72,000 --> 0:09:33,000
we must prepare the next generation

181
0:09:34.44,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that cares about the environment and people,

182
0:09:37.52,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and that can actually do something about it.

183
0:09:40.2,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Thank you.

184
0:09:41.44,000 --> 0:09:44,000
(Applause)

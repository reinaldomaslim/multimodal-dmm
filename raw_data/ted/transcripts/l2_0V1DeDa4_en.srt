Two years ago here at TED

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I reported that we had discovered

3
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
at Saturn, with the Cassini Spacecraft,

4
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
an anomalously warm and geologically active region

5
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
at the southern tip of the small Saturnine moon

6
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Enceladus, seen here.

7
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
This region seen here for the first time

8
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
in the Cassini image taken in 2005. This is the south polar region,

9
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
with the famous tiger-stripe fractures crossing the south pole.

10
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And seen just recently in late 2008,

11
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
here is that region again,

12
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere

13
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
is experiencing the onset of August

14
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and eventually winter.

15
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
And I also reported that we'd made this mind-blowing discovery --

16
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
this once-in-a-lifetime discovery

17
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
of towering jets

18
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
erupting from those fractures at the south pole,

19
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
consisting of tiny water ice crystals

20
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
accompanied by water vapor

21
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane.

22
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And at that time two years ago

23
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I mentioned that we were speculating

24
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that these jets might in fact be geysers,

25
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and erupting from pockets

26
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface,

27
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
but we weren't really sure.

28
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
However, the implications of those results --

29
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
of a possible environment within this moon

30
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that could support prebiotic chemistry,

31
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and perhaps life itself --

32
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
were so exciting that, in the intervening two years,

33
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
we have focused more on Enceladus.

34
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
We've flown the Cassini Spacecraft

35
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
by this moon now several times,

36
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
flying closer and deeper into these jets,

37
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
into the denser regions of these jets,

38
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
so that now we have come away with some

39
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
very precise compositional measurements.

40
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And we have found

41
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that the organic compounds coming from this moon

42
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
are in fact more complex than we previously reported.

43
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
While they're not amino acids,

44
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
we're now finding things like

45
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
propane and benzene,

46
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
hydrogen cyanide, and formaldehyde.

47
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And the tiny water crystals here

48
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
now look for all the world

49
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
like they are frozen droplets of salty water,

50
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
which is a discovery that suggests

51
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that not only do the jets come from

52
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
pockets of liquid water,

53
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but that that liquid water is in contact with rock.

54
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And that is a circumstance

55
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that could supply the chemical energy

56
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life.

57
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So we are very encouraged by these results.

58
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And we are much more confident now than we were two years ago

59
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that we might indeed

60
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
have on this moon, under the south pole,

61
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms.

62
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Whether or not there are living organisms there, of course,

63
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
is an entirely different matter.

64
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And that will have to await the arrival,

65
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
back at Enceladus,

66
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
of the spacecrafts, hopefully some time in the near future,

67
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
specifically equipped to address that particular question.

68
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day

69
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
when we might journey to the Saturnine system,

70
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park,

71
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
just because we can.

72
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Thank you.

73
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000

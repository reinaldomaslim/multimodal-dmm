1
0:00:00.03,000 --> 0:00:04,000
in 2010 the Miami Heat tried to build a

2
0:00:03.06,000 --> 0:00:07,000
dream team around LeBron James and two

3
0:00:04.95,000 --> 0:00:08,000
other stars and LeBron promised that

4
0:00:07.68,000 --> 0:00:18,000
they would win some championship what's

5
0:00:09.059,000 --> 0:00:21,000
wrong tell us about that but they

6
0:00:19.56,000 --> 0:00:23,000
struggled to even win close games in the

7
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
regular season so the next year instead

8
0:00:23.97,000 --> 0:00:26,000
of picking up another star

9
0:00:25.32,000 --> 0:00:29,000
they added Shane Battier and Shane told

10
0:00:27.66,000 --> 0:00:31,000
me people were not impressed and people

11
0:00:30.09,000 --> 0:00:33,000
looked him on limitations and say oh bad

12
0:00:31.8,000 --> 0:00:34,000
he is not athletic and he doesn't run

13
0:00:33.66,000 --> 0:00:36,000
pick-and-roll and you can't really

14
0:00:34.8,000 --> 0:00:38,000
dribble but here's the weird thing when

15
0:00:37.649,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Shane was on the court every one of his

16
0:00:39.48,000 --> 0:00:42,000
teams was statistically more likely to

17
0:00:41.37,000 --> 0:00:44,000
win he ended up becoming a key

18
0:00:43.29,000 --> 0:00:47,000
contributor to the heats back-to-back

19
0:00:45.03,000 --> 0:00:49,000
championships so I asked Michael Lewis

20
0:00:47.52,000 --> 0:00:52,000
the author of Moneyball to explain it

21
0:00:49.649,000 --> 0:00:55,000
so he wasn't athletic enough to to stop

22
0:00:52.949,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Kobe Bryant but he was smart enough and

23
0:00:55.86,000 --> 0:00:59,000
kind of canny enough to force Kobe

24
0:00:57.989,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Bryant two places on the floor where he

25
0:00:59.91,000 --> 0:01:02,000
was a less efficient shooter so he's

26
0:01:02.07,000 --> 0:01:07,000
doing all these things that are very

27
0:01:03.84,000 --> 0:01:1,000
valuable that no star would bother to do

28
0:01:07.369,000 --> 0:01:13,000
lots of stars means lots of egos and

29
0:01:10.89,000 --> 0:01:15,000
lots of egos means infighting in a team

30
0:01:14.159,000 --> 0:01:18,000
you could actually have too much talent

31
0:01:16.22,000 --> 0:01:2,000
look at the evidence from soccer teams

32
0:01:19.11,000 --> 0:01:23,000
with a mix of stars and role players

33
0:01:20.82,000 --> 0:01:25,000
actually win more games in World Cup

34
0:01:23.52,000 --> 0:01:28,000
qualifying matches we see the same

35
0:01:26.4,000 --> 0:01:3,000
pattern in NBA basketball you are

36
0:01:28.71,000 --> 0:01:32,000
actually better off with two stars on

37
0:01:30.63,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the court than four and the same is true

38
0:01:33.479,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in wall street teams the secret

39
0:01:36.21,000 --> 0:01:4,000
ingredient that role players bring is

40
0:01:37.89,000 --> 0:01:41,000
humility but we've all been in

41
0:01:40.56,000 --> 0:01:44,000
situations where we might be worried

42
0:01:42.509,000 --> 0:01:46,000
about being too humble like in a job

43
0:01:44.79,000 --> 0:01:46,000
interview

44
0:01:49.09,000 --> 0:01:54,000
we also council leaders not to be too

45
0:01:52.07,000 --> 0:01:56,000
humble but what is it data actually show

46
0:01:54.53,000 --> 0:01:58,000
let's compare humble leaders with

47
0:01:56.45,000 --> 0:02:,000
narcissistic leaders we've done this in

48
0:01:58.85,000 --> 0:02:02,000
American and Chinese companies and lo

49
0:02:01.43,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and behold it turns out that humble

50
0:02:03.47,000 --> 0:02:06,000
leaders are significantly more effective

51
0:02:04.94,000 --> 0:02:09,000
their employees are more productive and

52
0:02:07.369,000 --> 0:02:12,000
more innovative but there's a third kind

53
0:02:10.85,000 --> 0:02:13,000
of leader that gets even better results

54
0:02:12.739,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and that would be called a humble

55
0:02:14.72,000 --> 0:02:2,000
narcissist how can you be humble and

56
0:02:18.89,000 --> 0:02:22,000
narcissistic they sound like opposites

57
0:02:20.81,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but they're not because narcissism is

58
0:02:23.63,000 --> 0:02:27,000
about believing that you're special and

59
0:02:25.48,000 --> 0:02:3,000
humility is about recognizing that you

60
0:02:27.92,000 --> 0:02:32,000
are fallible now for the narcissist in

61
0:02:30.8,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the room and your spouse's know who you

62
0:02:33.08,000 --> 0:02:4,000
are this is not an excuse my point is

63
0:02:37.4,000 --> 0:02:41,000
just that humility and confidence can

64
0:02:40.25,000 --> 0:02:44,000
actually go hand-in-hand you can have

65
0:02:42.17,000 --> 0:02:46,000
both because one of the Latin roots of

66
0:02:45.23,000 --> 0:02:49,000
humility is actually about being

67
0:02:46.64,000 --> 0:02:51,000
grounded it means from the earth and

68
0:02:49.519,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that kind of sensibility is what shane

69
0:02:51.709,000 --> 0:02:55,000
battier I brought to the Miami Heat

70
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
you've recognized his limitations he

71
0:02:56.209,000 --> 0:02:59,000
looked for ways to improve his game like

72
0:02:58.25,000 --> 0:03:02,000
studying stats and opposing players and

73
0:03:00.14,000 --> 0:03:04,000
one day he turned to LeBron and he said

74
0:03:02.48,000 --> 0:03:06,000
hey when you guard Kevin Durant make him

75
0:03:04.64,000 --> 0:03:07,000
shoot over his left shoulder and after

76
0:03:06.92,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that every now and then he'd say hey

77
0:03:08.48,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Batman you know what what you got on

78
0:03:10.519,000 --> 0:03:13,000
this guy there's not much you can teach

79
0:03:12.11,000 --> 0:03:16,000
LeBron James the best player in the

80
0:03:13.7,000 --> 0:03:17,000
world today I like to think I I made him

81
0:03:16.7,000 --> 0:03:2,000
a little bit better with some loose some

82
0:03:18.53,000 --> 0:03:23,000
arcane math humility is underrated it

83
0:03:21.65,000 --> 0:03:25,000
gets a bad rap it sounds like a sign of

84
0:03:23.54,000 --> 0:03:27,000
weakness but in the best teams with the

85
0:03:25.79,000 --> 0:03:28,000
best leaders is actually a source of

86
0:03:27.62,000 --> 0:03:31,000
strength it keeps us from best-of from

87
0:03:29.72,000 --> 0:03:33,000
resting on our laurels because we know

88
0:03:31.76,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that excellence is not about believing

89
0:03:33.95,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that you're the best

90
0:03:34.85,000 --> 0:03:39,000
it's actually about always striving to

91
0:03:36.859,000 --> 0:03:39,000
get better thank you

92
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
you

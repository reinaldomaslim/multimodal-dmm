1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
One of my favorite parts

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
of my job at the Gates Foundation

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
is that I get to travel to the developing world,

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and I do that quite regularly.

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And when I meet the mothers

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in so many of these remote places,

7
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'm really struck by the things

8
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that we have in common.

9
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
They want what we want for our children

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and that is for their children to grow up successful,

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to be healthy, and to have a successful life.

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But I also see lots of poverty,

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and it's quite jarring,

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
both in the scale and the scope of it.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
My first trip in India, I was in a person's home

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
where they had dirt floors, no running water,

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
no electricity,

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and that's really what I see all over the world.

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So in short, I'm startled by all the things

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that they don't have.

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But I am surprised by one thing that they do have:

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Coca-Cola.

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Coke is everywhere.

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
In fact, when I travel to the developing world,

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Coke feels ubiquitous.

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And so when I come back from these trips,

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and I'm thinking about development,

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and I'm flying home and I'm thinking,

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
"We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations,"

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
you know, Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder:

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
how is it that they can get Coke

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to these far-flung places?

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
If they can do that,

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing?

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And I'm not the first person to ask this question.

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But I think, as a community,

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
we still have a lot to learn.

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
It's staggering, if you think about Coca-Cola.

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
They sell 1.5 billion servings

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
every single day.

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
That's like every man, woman and child on the planet

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
having a serving of Coke every week.

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So why does this matter?

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Well, if we're going to speed up the progress

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and go even faster

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world,

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
we need to learn from the innovators,

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and those innovators

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
come from every single sector.

50
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I feel that, if we can understand

51
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
what makes something like Coca-Cola ubiquitous,

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
we can apply those lessons then for the public good.

53
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Coke's success is relevant,

54
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
because if we can analyze it, learn from it,

55
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
then we can save lives.

56
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke.

57
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And I think there are really three things

58
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
we can take away from Coca-Cola.

59
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
They take real-time data

60
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and immediately feed it back into the product.

61
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
They tap into local entrepreneurial talent,

62
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and they do incredible marketing.

63
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So let's start with the data.

64
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Now Coke has a very clear bottom line --

65
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
they report to a set of shareholders, they have to turn a profit.

66
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So they take the data,

67
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and they use it to measure progress.

68
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
They have this very continuous feedback loop.

69
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
They learn something, they put it back into the product,

70
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
they put it back into the market.

71
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
They have a whole team called "Knowledge and Insight."

72
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It's a lot like other consumer companies.

73
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So if you're running Namibia for Coca-Cola,

74
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and you have a 107 constituencies,

75
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
you know where every can versus bottle

76
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
of Sprite, Fanta or Coke was sold,

77
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
whether it was a corner store,

78
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
a supermarket or a pushcart.

79
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So if sales start to drop,

80
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
then the person can identify the problem

81
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and address the issue.

82
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Let's contrast that for a minute to development.

83
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
In development, the evaluation comes

84
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
at the very end of the project.

85
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I've sat in a lot of those meetings,

86
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and by then,

87
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
it is way too late to use the data.

88
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I had somebody from an NGO

89
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
once describe it to me as bowling in the dark.

90
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
They said, "You roll the ball, you hear some pins go down.

91
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It's dark, you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on,

92
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and then you an see your impact."

93
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Real-time data

94
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
turns on the lights.

95
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So what's the second thing that Coke's good at?

96
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
They're good at tapping into

97
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that local entrepreneurial talent.

98
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Coke's been in Africa since 1928,

99
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets,

100
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world,

101
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
which was a large truck rolling down the street.

102
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And in Africa, the remote places,

103
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
it's hard to find a good road.

104
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But Coke noticed something --

105
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
they noticed that local people were taking the product, buying it in bulk

106
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places.

107
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And so they took a bit of time to learn about that.

108
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And they decided in 1990

109
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs,

110
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
giving them small loans.

111
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
They set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers,

112
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people,

113
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows

114
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to sell the product.

115
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
There are now some 3,000 of these centers

116
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
employing about 15,000 people in Africa.

117
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
In Tanzania and Uganda,

118
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
they represent 90 percent

119
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
of Coke's sales.

120
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Let's look at the development side.

121
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
What is it that governments and NGOs

122
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
can learn from Coke?

123
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Governments and NGOs

124
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well,

125
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
because the locals know how to reach

126
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the very hard-to-serve places, their neighbors,

127
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and they know what motivates them to make change.

128
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I think a great example of this

129
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is Ethiopia's new health extension program.

130
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
The government noticed in Ethiopia

131
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic,

132
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic.

133
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So if you're in an emergency situation -- or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby --

134
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
forget it, to get to the health care center.

135
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
They decided that wasn't good enough,

136
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
so they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala

137
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that also had a system like this,

138
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
and they adapted it for Ethiopia.

139
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And in 2003, the government of Ethiopia

140
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
started this new system in their own country.

141
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
They trained 35,000 health extension workers

142
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to deliver care directly to the people.

143
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
In just five years,

144
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people

145
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to one worker for every 2,500 people.

146
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Now, think about

147
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
how this can change people's lives.

148
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Health extension workers can help with so many things,

149
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
whether it's family planning, prenatal care,

150
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
immunizations for the children,

151
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
or advising the woman to get to the facility on time

152
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
for an on-time delivery.

153
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
That is having real impact

154
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in a country like Ethiopia,

155
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and it's why you see their child mortality numbers

156
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
coming down 25 percent

157
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
from 2000 to 2008.

158
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
In Ethiopia, there are hundreds of thousands of children living

159
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
because of this health extension worker program.

160
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So what's the next step for Ethiopia?

161
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Well, they're already starting talk about this.

162
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
They're starting to talk about, "How do you have the health community workers

163
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
generate their own ideas?

164
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
How do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting

165
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
out in those remote villages?"

166
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
That's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent

167
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and you unlock people's potential.

168
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
The third component of Coke's success

169
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
is marketing.

170
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Ultimately, Coke's success

171
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
depends on one crucial fact

172
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and that is that people want

173
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
a Coca-Cola.

174
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Now the reason these micro-entrepreneurs

175
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
can sell or make a profit

176
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow.

177
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So, they rely on Coca-Cola

178
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
in terms of its marketing,

179
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and what's the secret to their marketing?

180
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Well, it's aspirational.

181
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
It is associated that product

182
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
with a kind of life that people want to live.

183
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So even though it's a global company,

184
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
they take a very local approach.

185
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Coke's global campaign slogan

186
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
is "Open Happiness."

187
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
But they localize it.

188
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And they don't just guess what makes people happy;

189
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
they go to places like Latin America

190
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and they realize that happiness there

191
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
is associated with family life.

192
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And in South Africa,

193
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
they associate happiness

194
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
with seriti or community respect.

195
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Now, that played itself out in the World Cup campaign.

196
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it,

197
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
"Wavin' Flag" by a Somali hip hop artist.

198
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000

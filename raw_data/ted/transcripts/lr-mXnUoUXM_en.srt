1
0:00:12.639,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Well, good afternoon.

2
0:00:14.378,000 --> 0:00:16,000
How many of you

3
0:00:16.393,000 --> 0:00:18,000
took the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge?

4
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Applause)

5
0:00:20.69,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Woo hoo!

6
0:00:22.95,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Well, I have to tell you, from the bottom of our hearts,

7
0:00:26.038,000 --> 0:00:28,000
thank you so very, very much.

8
0:00:28.818,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Do you know to date the ALS Association

9
0:00:31.469,000 --> 0:00:36,000
has raised 125 million dollars?

10
0:00:36.787,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Woo hoo! (Applause)

11
0:00:43.239,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It takes me back to the summer of 2011.

12
0:00:46.513,000 --> 0:00:48,000
My family, my kids had all grown up.

13
0:00:48.602,000 --> 0:00:49,000
We were officially empty nesters,

14
0:00:50.228,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and we decided, let's go on a family vacation.

15
0:00:53.199,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Jenn, my daughter, and my son-in-law

16
0:00:55.306,000 --> 0:00:56,000
came down from New York.

17
0:00:56.88,000 --> 0:00:57,000
My youngest, Andrew,

18
0:00:58.342,000 --> 0:01:,000
he came down from his home in Charlestown

19
0:01:00.897,000 --> 0:01:01,000
where he was working in Boston,

20
0:01:02.675,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and my son Pete,

21
0:01:03.916,000 --> 0:01:05,000
who had played at Boston College, baseball,

22
0:01:06.858,000 --> 0:01:08,000
had played baseball professionally in Europe,

23
0:01:09.682,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and had now come home and was selling group insurance, he also joined us.

24
0:01:14.559,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And one night, I found myself

25
0:01:15.981,000 --> 0:01:16,000
having a beer with Pete,

26
0:01:17.602,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and Pete was looking at me and he just said,

27
0:01:20.27,000 --> 0:01:22,000
"You know, Mom, I don't know,

28
0:01:22.46,000 --> 0:01:25,000
selling group insurance is just not my passion."

29
0:01:26.459,000 --> 0:01:31,000
He said, "I just don't feel I'm living up to my potential.

30
0:01:32.087,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I don't feel this is my mission in life."

31
0:01:35.266,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And he said, "You know, oh by the way, Mom,

32
0:01:38.707,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I have to leave early from vacation

33
0:01:41.512,000 --> 0:01:45,000
because my inter-city league team that I play for made the playoffs,

34
0:01:45.956,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and I have to get back to Boston because I can't let my team down.

35
0:01:50.665,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I'm just not as passionate about my job

36
0:01:53.88,000 --> 0:01:55,000
as I am about baseball."

37
0:01:56.146,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So off Pete went, and left the family vacation —

38
0:01:59.269,000 --> 0:02:,000
break a mother's heart —

39
0:02:00.985,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and he went, and we followed four days later

40
0:02:05.297,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to see the next playoff game.

41
0:02:07.943,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We're at the playoff game, Pete's at the plate,

42
0:02:10.573,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and a fastball's coming in,

43
0:02:12.974,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and it hits him on the wrist.

44
0:02:15.29,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Oh, Pete.

45
0:02:17.54,000 --> 0:02:19,000
His wrist went completely limp, like this.

46
0:02:20.274,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So for the next six months,

47
0:02:21.79,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Pete went back to his home in Southie,

48
0:02:24.47,000 --> 0:02:26,000
kept working that unpassionate job,

49
0:02:27.417,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and was going to doctors

50
0:02:28.813,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to see what was wrong with this wrist

51
0:02:30.686,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that never came back.

52
0:02:32.556,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Six months later, in March,

53
0:02:34.522,000 --> 0:02:35,000
he called my husband and me, and he said,

54
0:02:36.485,000 --> 0:02:38,000
"Oh, Mom and Dad, we have a doctor

55
0:02:38.487,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that found a diagnosis for that wrist.

56
0:02:41.491,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Do you want to come with the doctor's appointment with me?"

57
0:02:44.647,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I said, "Sure, we'll come in."

58
0:02:46.62,000 --> 0:02:49,000
That morning, Pete, John and I

59
0:02:49.736,000 --> 0:02:51,000
all got up, got dressed, got in our cars —

60
0:02:52.234,000 --> 0:02:53,000
three separate cars

61
0:02:53.571,000 --> 0:02:54,000
because we were going to go to work

62
0:02:55.338,000 --> 0:02:58,000
after the doctor's appointment to find out what happened to the wrist.

63
0:02:58.547,000 --> 0:03:,000
We walked into the neurologist's office, sat down,

64
0:03:01.109,000 --> 0:03:02,000
four doctors walk in,

65
0:03:02.976,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and the head neurologist sits down.

66
0:03:05.02,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And he says, "Well, Pete, we've been looking at all the tests,

67
0:03:08.06,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and I have to tell you, it's not a sprained wrist,

68
0:03:11.473,000 --> 0:03:13,000
it's not a broken wrist,

69
0:03:13.854,000 --> 0:03:15,000
it's not nerve damage in the wrist,

70
0:03:15.9,000 --> 0:03:16,000
it's not an infection,

71
0:03:17.712,000 --> 0:03:2,000
it's not Lyme disease."

72
0:03:21.48,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And there was this deliberate elimination going up,

73
0:03:25.14,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and I was thinking to myself,

74
0:03:26.723,000 --> 0:03:29,000
where is he going with this?

75
0:03:30.04,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Then he put his hands on his knees,

76
0:03:32.21,000 --> 0:03:35,000
he looked right at my 27-year-old kid, and said,

77
0:03:35.361,000 --> 0:03:38,000
"I don't know how to tell a 27-year-old this:

78
0:03:38.577,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Pete, you have ALS."

79
0:03:42.472,000 --> 0:03:44,000
ALS?

80
0:03:44.654,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I had had a friend whose 80-year-old father had ALS.

81
0:03:49.379,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I looked at my husband, he looked at me,

82
0:03:51.44,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and then we looked at the doctor, and we said, "ALS?

83
0:03:53.982,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Okay, what treatment? Let's go.

84
0:03:56.218,000 --> 0:03:59,000
What do we do? Let's go."

85
0:03:59.523,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And he looked at us, and he said, "Mr. and Mrs. Frates,

86
0:04:02.407,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I'm sorry to tell you this,

87
0:04:04.356,000 --> 0:04:08,000
but there's no treatment and there's no cure."

88
0:04:08.884,000 --> 0:04:1,000
We were the worst culprits.

89
0:04:11.729,000 --> 0:04:13,000
We didn't even understand

90
0:04:14.264,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that it had been 75 years since Lou Gehrig

91
0:04:16.313,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and nothing had been done in the progress against ALS.

92
0:04:21.805,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So we all went home, and Jenn and Dan

93
0:04:24.975,000 --> 0:04:26,000
flew home from Wall Street,

94
0:04:27.166,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Andrew came home from Charlestown,

95
0:04:29.787,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and Pete went to B.C. to pick up

96
0:04:32.217,000 --> 0:04:35,000
his then-girlfriend Julie and brought her home,

97
0:04:35.436,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and six hours later after diagnosis,

98
0:04:37.369,000 --> 0:04:39,000
we're sitting around having a family dinner,

99
0:04:40.125,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and we're having small chat.

100
0:04:42.46,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I don't even remember cooking dinner that night.

101
0:04:45.279,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But then our leader, Pete, set the vision,

102
0:04:51.646,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and talked to us just like we were his new team.

103
0:04:54.802,000 --> 0:04:57,000
He said, "There will be no wallowing, people."

104
0:04:58.493,000 --> 0:05:,000
He goes, "We're not looking back,

105
0:05:00.814,000 --> 0:05:02,000
we're looking forward.

106
0:05:02.869,000 --> 0:05:07,000
What an amazing opportunity we have to change the world.

107
0:05:08.623,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I'm going to change the face

108
0:05:10.958,000 --> 0:05:13,000
of this unacceptable situation of ALS.

109
0:05:14.111,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We're going to move the needle,

110
0:05:15.969,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and I'm going to get it in front of philanthropists like Bill Gates."

111
0:05:20.393,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And that was it. We were given our directive.

112
0:05:23.899,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So in the days and months that followed,

113
0:05:26.13,000 --> 0:05:29,000
within a week, we had our brothers and sisters

114
0:05:29.417,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and our family come to us,

115
0:05:31.568,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that they were already creating Team Frate Train.

116
0:05:34.063,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Uncle Dave, he was the webmaster;

117
0:05:36.971,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Uncle Artie, he was the accountant;

118
0:05:39.318,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Auntie Dana, she was the graphic artist;

119
0:05:42.097,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and my youngest son, Andrew,

120
0:05:44.648,000 --> 0:05:46,000
quit his job, left his apartment in Charlestown

121
0:05:47.635,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and says, "I'm going to take care of Pete and be his caregiver."

122
0:05:51.601,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Then all those people, classmates, teammates,

123
0:05:54.942,000 --> 0:05:56,000
coworkers that Pete had inspired

124
0:05:57.449,000 --> 0:05:59,000
throughout his whole life,

125
0:05:59.607,000 --> 0:06:03,000
the circles of Pete all started intersecting with one another,

126
0:06:03.715,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and made Team Frate Train.

127
0:06:07.959,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Six months after diagnosis,

128
0:06:10.06,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Pete was given an award at a research summit for advocacy.

129
0:06:15.047,000 --> 0:06:17,000
He got up and gave a very eloquent speech,

130
0:06:17.976,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and at the end of the speech, there was a panel,

131
0:06:20.582,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and on the panel were these pharmaceutical executives

132
0:06:23.48,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and biochemists and clinicians

133
0:06:25.89,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and I'm sitting there and I'm listening to them

134
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and most of the content went straight over my head.

135
0:06:31.482,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I avoided every science class I ever could.

136
0:06:33.76,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But I was watching these people, and I was listening to them,

137
0:06:36.654,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and they were saying, "I, I do this, I do that,"

138
0:06:39.388,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and there was a real unfamiliarity between them.

139
0:06:43.319,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So at the end of their talk, the panel,

140
0:06:46.632,000 --> 0:06:47,000
they had questions and answers,

141
0:06:48.465,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and boom, my hand went right up,

142
0:06:50.562,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and I get the microphone,

143
0:06:51.867,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and I look at them and I say, "Thank you.

144
0:06:53.871,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Thank you so much for working in ALS.

145
0:06:56.27,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It means so very much to us."

146
0:06:57.995,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I said, "But I do have to tell you

147
0:06:59.8,000 --> 0:07:,000
that I'm watching your body language

148
0:07:01.741,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and I'm listening to what you're saying.

149
0:07:03.862,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It just doesn't seem like there's a whole lot of collaboration going on here.

150
0:07:09.233,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And not only that, where's the flip chart

151
0:07:12.375,000 --> 0:07:16,000
with the action items and the follow-up and the accountability?

152
0:07:17.157,000 --> 0:07:2,000
What are you going to do after you leave this room?"

153
0:07:21.149,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And then I turned around

154
0:07:23.984,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and there was about 200 pairs of eyes just staring at me.

155
0:07:30.75,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And it was that point that I realized

156
0:07:34.31,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that I had talked about the elephant in the room.

157
0:07:38.781,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Thus my mission had begun.

158
0:07:41.892,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So over the next couple of years,

159
0:07:44.862,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Pete — we've had our highs and our lows.

160
0:07:47.5,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Pete was put on a compassionate use drug.

161
0:07:49.938,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It was hope in a bottle for the whole ALS community.

162
0:07:53.121,000 --> 0:07:55,000
It was in a phase III trial.

163
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Then six months later, the data comes back: no efficacy.

164
0:07:59.917,000 --> 0:08:01,000
We were supposed to have therapies overseas,

165
0:08:02.388,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and the rug was pulled out from under us.

166
0:08:04.537,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So for the next two years,

167
0:08:06.482,000 --> 0:08:1,000
we just watched my son be taken away from me,

168
0:08:10.764,000 --> 0:08:13,000
little by little every day.

169
0:08:14.435,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Two and a half years ago,

170
0:08:16.952,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Pete was hitting home runs at baseball fields.

171
0:08:20.11,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Today, Pete's completely paralyzed.

172
0:08:23.94,000 --> 0:08:25,000
He can't hold his head up any longer.

173
0:08:26.306,000 --> 0:08:28,000
He's confined to a motorized wheelchair.

174
0:08:28.92,000 --> 0:08:3,000
He can no longer swallow or eat.

175
0:08:31.138,000 --> 0:08:32,000
He has a feeding tube.

176
0:08:33.033,000 --> 0:08:35,000
He can't speak.

177
0:08:37.239,000 --> 0:08:4,000
He talks with eye gaze technology

178
0:08:40.775,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and a speech generating device,

179
0:08:42.726,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and we're watching his lungs,

180
0:08:44.195,000 --> 0:08:47,000
because his diaphragm eventually is going to give out

181
0:08:47.2,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and then the decision will be made to put him on a ventilator or not.

182
0:08:51.978,000 --> 0:09:,000
ALS robs the human of all their physical parts, but the brain stays intact.

183
0:09:01.586,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So July 4th, 2014,

184
0:09:06.207,000 --> 0:09:1,000
75th year of Lou Gehrig's inspirational speech comes,

185
0:09:10.615,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and Pete is asked by MLB.com to write an article in the Bleacher Report.

186
0:09:16.159,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And it was very significant, because he wrote it using his eye gaze technology.

187
0:09:23.252,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Twenty days later, the ice started to fall.

188
0:09:29.501,000 --> 0:09:33,000
On July 27th, Pete's roommate in New York City,

189
0:09:34.176,000 --> 0:09:36,000
wearing a Quinn For The Win shirt,

190
0:09:36.785,000 --> 0:09:39,000
signifying Pat Quinn, another ALS patient known in New York,

191
0:09:40.635,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and B.C. shorts

192
0:09:42.686,000 --> 0:09:46,000
said, "I'm taking the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge,"

193
0:09:47.178,000 --> 0:09:49,000
picked up the ice, put it over his head.

194
0:09:49.958,000 --> 0:09:53,000
"And I'm nominating ..." And he sent it up to Boston.

195
0:09:54.166,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And that was on July 27th.

196
0:09:57.59,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Over the next couple of days, our news feed

197
0:10:00.161,000 --> 0:10:02,000
was full of family and friends.

198
0:10:02.696,000 --> 0:10:04,000
If you haven't gone back, the nice thing about Facebook

199
0:10:05.374,000 --> 0:10:07,000
is that you have the dates, you can go back.

200
0:10:07.587,000 --> 0:10:1,000
You've got to see Uncle Artie's human Bloody Mary.

201
0:10:11.558,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I'm telling you, it's one of the best ones,

202
0:10:14.704,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and that was probably in day two.

203
0:10:17.666,000 --> 0:10:2,000
By about day four, Uncle Dave, the webmaster,

204
0:10:21.636,000 --> 0:10:22,000
he isn't on Facebook,

205
0:10:23.609,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and I get a text from him, and it says, "Nancy,

206
0:10:26.496,000 --> 0:10:28,000
what the hell is going on?"

207
0:10:29.39,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Uncle Dave gets a hit every time Pete's website

208
0:10:32.987,000 --> 0:10:35,000
is gone onto, and his phone was blowing up.

209
0:10:36.01,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So we all sat down and we realized,

210
0:10:37.865,000 --> 0:10:4,000
money is coming in — how amazing.

211
0:10:41.717,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So we knew awareness would lead to funding,

212
0:10:44.261,000 --> 0:10:46,000
we just didn't know it would only take a couple of days.

213
0:10:47.239,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So we got together, put our best 501(c)(3)s on Pete's website,

214
0:10:52.396,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and off we went.

215
0:10:54.505,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So week one, Boston media.

216
0:10:57.686,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Week two, national media.

217
0:11:00.154,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It was during week two that our neighbor next door

218
0:11:02.608,000 --> 0:11:04,000
opened up our door and threw a pizza

219
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:07,000
across the kitchen floor, saying,

220
0:11:07.36,000 --> 0:11:09,000
"I think you people might need food in there."

221
0:11:10.299,000 --> 0:11:12,000
(Laughter)

222
0:11:12.504,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Week three, celebrities — Entertainment Tonight,

223
0:11:16.52,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Access Hollywood.

224
0:11:18.586,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Week four, global — BBC, Irish Radio.

225
0:11:24.741,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Did anyone see "Lost In Translation"?

226
0:11:27.663,000 --> 0:11:29,000
My husband did Japanese television.

227
0:11:29.852,000 --> 0:11:3,000
It was interesting.

228
0:11:31.562,000 --> 0:11:33,000
(Laughter)

229
0:11:33.614,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And those videos, the popular ones.

230
0:11:39.376,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Paul Bissonnette's glacier video, incredible.

231
0:11:43.864,000 --> 0:11:45,000
How about the redemption nuns of Dublin?

232
0:11:46.601,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Who's seen that one?

233
0:11:48.306,000 --> 0:11:5,000
It's absolutely fantastic.

234
0:11:50.893,000 --> 0:11:52,000
J.T., Justin Timberlake.

235
0:11:53.11,000 --> 0:11:56,000
That's when we knew, that was a real A-list celebrity.

236
0:11:56.879,000 --> 0:11:58,000
I go back on my texts, and I can see

237
0:11:59.77,000 --> 0:12:04,000
"JT! JT!" My sister texting me.

238
0:12:04.902,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany.

239
0:12:08.15,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Incredible.

240
0:12:09.956,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And the ALS patients,

241
0:12:12.266,000 --> 0:12:15,000
you know what their favorite ones are, and their families'?

242
0:12:15.46,000 --> 0:12:16,000
All of them.

243
0:12:17.05,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Because this misunderstood and underfunded "rare" disease,

244
0:12:21.898,000 --> 0:12:27,000
they just sat and watched people saying it over and over: "ALS, ALS."

245
0:12:28.378,000 --> 0:12:31,000
It was unbelievable.

246
0:12:31.587,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And those naysayers,

247
0:12:33.63,000 --> 0:12:35,000
let's just talk a couple of stats, shall we?

248
0:12:36.469,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Okay, so the ALS Association,

249
0:12:39.107,000 --> 0:12:42,000
they think by year end, it'll be 160 million dollars.

250
0:12:43.064,000 --> 0:12:45,000
ALS TDI in Cambridge,

251
0:12:45.649,000 --> 0:12:47,000
they raised three million dollars.

252
0:12:47.701,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Well, guess what?

253
0:12:49.143,000 --> 0:12:52,000
They had a clinical trial for a drug that they've been developing.

254
0:12:52.437,000 --> 0:12:55,000
It was on a three-year track for funding.

255
0:12:55.553,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Two months.

256
0:12:57.04,000 --> 0:12:59,000
It's coming out starting in two months.

257
0:12:59.328,000 --> 0:13:02,000
(Applause)

258
0:13:05.791,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And YouTube has reported

259
0:13:10.806,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that over 150 countries have posted Ice Bucket Challenges for ALS.

260
0:13:17.884,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And Facebook, 2.5 million videos,

261
0:13:24.455,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and I had the awesome adventure

262
0:13:27.57,000 --> 0:13:29,000
visiting the Facebook campus last week,

263
0:13:30.29,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and I said to them, "I know what it was like in my house.

264
0:13:33.057,000 --> 0:13:35,000
I can't imagine what it was like around here."

265
0:13:35.677,000 --> 0:13:39,000
All she said was, "Jaw-dropping."

266
0:13:40.39,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And my family's favorite video?

267
0:13:45.37,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Bill Gates.

268
0:13:48.576,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Because the night Pete was diagnosed,

269
0:13:51.659,000 --> 0:13:58,000
he told us that he was going to get ALS in front of philanthropists like Bill Gates,

270
0:13:59.244,000 --> 0:14:,000
and he did it.

271
0:14:00.79,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Goal number one, check.

272
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Now on to the treatment and cure.

273
0:14:05.203,000 --> 0:14:11,000
(Applause)

274
0:14:14.775,000 --> 0:14:17,000
So okay, after all of this ice,

275
0:14:17.829,000 --> 0:14:18,000
we know that it was much more

276
0:14:19.725,000 --> 0:14:21,000
than just pouring buckets of ice water over your head,

277
0:14:22.547,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and I really would like to leave you

278
0:14:24.375,000 --> 0:14:26,000
with a couple of things that I'd like you to remember.

279
0:14:27.289,000 --> 0:14:28,000
The first thing is,

280
0:14:28.964,000 --> 0:14:3,000
every morning when you wake up,

281
0:14:31.19,000 --> 0:14:34,000
you can choose to live your day in positivity.

282
0:14:36.249,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Would any of you blame me

283
0:14:38.52,000 --> 0:14:4,000
if I just was in the fetal position

284
0:14:40.859,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and pulled the covers over my head every day?

285
0:14:44.096,000 --> 0:14:46,000
No, I don't think anybody would blame me,

286
0:14:46.308,000 --> 0:14:49,000
but Pete has inspired us to wake up

287
0:14:49.31,000 --> 0:14:52,000
every morning and be positive and proactive.

288
0:14:52.496,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I actually had to ditch support groups

289
0:14:55.3,000 --> 0:14:57,000
because everybody was in there saying that

290
0:14:57.779,000 --> 0:14:58,000
spraying their lawns with chemicals,

291
0:14:59.613,000 --> 0:15:,000
that's why they got ALS,

292
0:15:01.481,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and I was like, "I don't think so,"

293
0:15:03.44,000 --> 0:15:07,000
but I had to get away from the negativity.

294
0:15:07.459,000 --> 0:15:09,000
The second thing I want to leave you with

295
0:15:10.346,000 --> 0:15:12,000
is the person at the middle of the challenge

296
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
has to be willing to have the mental toughness

297
0:15:16.24,000 --> 0:15:19,000
to put themselves out there.

298
0:15:19.985,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Pete still goes to baseball games

299
0:15:22.21,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and he still sits with his teammates in the dugout,

300
0:15:25.264,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and he hangs his gravity feed bag

301
0:15:28.147,000 --> 0:15:29,000
right on the cages.

302
0:15:29.547,000 --> 0:15:3,000
You'll see the kids, they're up there hanging it up.

303
0:15:31.317,000 --> 0:15:32,000
"Pete, is that okay?" "Yup."

304
0:15:32.988,000 --> 0:15:35,000
And then they put it right into his stomach.

305
0:15:36.239,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Because he wants them to see what the reality of this is,

306
0:15:39.641,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and how he's never, ever going to give up.

307
0:15:43.013,000 --> 0:15:45,000
And the third thing I want to leave you with:

308
0:15:45.243,000 --> 0:15:48,000
If you ever come across a situation

309
0:15:48.759,000 --> 0:15:51,000
that you see as so unacceptable,

310
0:15:51.898,000 --> 0:15:54,000
I want you to dig down as deep as you can

311
0:15:55.621,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and find your best mother bear

312
0:15:58.476,000 --> 0:16:,000
and go after it.

313
0:16:00.885,000 --> 0:16:05,000
(Applause)

314
0:16:34.886,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Thank you.

315
0:16:36.954,000 --> 0:16:39,000
(Applause)

316
0:16:40.771,000 --> 0:16:41,000
I know that I'm running over,

317
0:16:42.43,000 --> 0:16:43,000
but I've got to leave you with this:

318
0:16:44.197,000 --> 0:16:47,000
the gifts that my son has given me.

319
0:16:47.371,000 --> 0:16:49,000
I have had 29 years

320
0:16:50.084,000 --> 0:16:53,000
of having the honor of being the mother

321
0:16:53.9,000 --> 0:16:55,000
of Pete Frates.

322
0:16:55.939,000 --> 0:17:,000
Pete Frates has been inspiring and leading his whole life.

323
0:17:00.985,000 --> 0:17:02,000
He's thrown out kindness,

324
0:17:03.257,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and all that kindness has come back to him.

325
0:17:06.897,000 --> 0:17:12,000
He walks the face of the Earth right now and knows why he's here.

326
0:17:13.342,000 --> 0:17:15,000
What a gift.

327
0:17:16.19,000 --> 0:17:18,000
The second thing that my son has given me

328
0:17:18.821,000 --> 0:17:21,000
is he's given me my mission in life.

329
0:17:21.876,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Now I know why I'm here.

330
0:17:23.68,000 --> 0:17:26,000
I'm going to save my son,

331
0:17:26.824,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and if it doesn't happen in time for him,

332
0:17:29.614,000 --> 0:17:31,000
I'm going to work so that no other mother

333
0:17:32.256,000 --> 0:17:35,000
has to go through what I'm going through.

334
0:17:35.815,000 --> 0:17:37,000
And the third thing, and last but not least

335
0:17:38.519,000 --> 0:17:41,000
gift that my son has given me,

336
0:17:41.546,000 --> 0:17:43,000
as an exclamation point

337
0:17:43.633,000 --> 0:17:44,000
to the miraculous month

338
0:17:45.426,000 --> 0:17:48,000
of August 2014:

339
0:17:49.104,000 --> 0:17:55,000
That girlfriend that he went to get on the night of diagnosis is now his wife,

340
0:17:55.248,000 --> 0:18:03,000
and Pete and Julie have given me my granddaughter, Lucy Fitzgerald Frates.

341
0:18:03.625,000 --> 0:18:08,000
Lucy Fitzgerald Frates came two weeks early

342
0:18:08.73,000 --> 0:18:1,000
as the exclamation point

343
0:18:10.928,000 --> 0:18:14,000
on August 31st, 2014.

344
0:18:15.307,000 --> 0:18:16,000
And so —

345
0:18:16.981,000 --> 0:18:24,000
(Applause) —

346
0:18:25.865,000 --> 0:18:28,000
And so let me leave you with Pete's words of inspiration

347
0:18:29.509,000 --> 0:18:36,000
that he would use to classmates, coworkers and teammates.

348
0:18:36.777,000 --> 0:18:39,000
Be passionate.

349
0:18:40.153,000 --> 0:18:42,000
Be genuine.

350
0:18:42.66,000 --> 0:18:44,000
Be hardworking.

351
0:18:45.654,000 --> 0:18:49,000
And don't forget to be great.

352
0:18:49.938,000 --> 0:18:51,000
Thank you. (Applause)

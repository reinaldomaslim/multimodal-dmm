0:00:15.948,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Fifteen years ago, it was widely assumed

3
0:00:18.837,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that the vast majority of brain development

4
0:00:20.887,000 --> 0:00:22,000
takes place in the first few years of life.

5
0:00:23.866,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Back then, 15 years ago, we didn't have the ability

6
0:00:26.578,000 --> 0:00:28,000
to look inside the living human brain

7
0:00:29.199,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and track development across the lifespan.

8
0:00:32.237,000 --> 0:00:35,000
In the past decade or so, mainly due to advances

9
0:00:35.398,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in brain imaging technology

10
0:00:37.203,000 --> 0:00:39,000
such as magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI,

11
0:00:40.146,000 --> 0:00:43,000
neuroscientists have started to look inside the living

12
0:00:43.273,000 --> 0:00:45,000
human brain of all ages, and to track changes

13
0:00:45.692,000 --> 0:00:47,000
in brain structure and brain function,

14
0:00:48.563,000 --> 0:00:51,000
so we use structural MRI if you'd like to take a snapshot,

15
0:00:52.24,000 --> 0:00:55,000
a photograph, at really high resolution of the inside

16
0:00:55.302,000 --> 0:00:58,000
of the living human brain, and we can ask questions like,

17
0:00:58.522,000 --> 0:01:,000
how much gray matter does the brain contain,

18
0:01:00.962,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and how does that change with age?

19
0:01:02.765,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And we also use functional MRI, called fMRI,

20
0:01:06.477,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to take a video, a movie, of brain activity

21
0:01:09.872,000 --> 0:01:11,000
when participants are taking part in some kind of task

22
0:01:12.74,000 --> 0:01:14,000
like thinking or feeling or perceiving something.

23
0:01:15.632,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So many labs around the world are involved in this kind

24
0:01:18.398,000 --> 0:01:2,000
of research, and we now have a really rich

25
0:01:20.628,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and detailed picture of how the living human brain develops,

26
0:01:24.152,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and this picture has radically changed the way

27
0:01:27.22,000 --> 0:01:29,000
we think about human brain development

28
0:01:29.853,000 --> 0:01:31,000
by revealing that it's not all over in early childhood,

29
0:01:32.621,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and instead, the brain continues to develop

30
0:01:35.332,000 --> 0:01:39,000
right throughout adolescence and into the '20s and '30s.

31
0:01:39.378,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts

32
0:01:43.357,000 --> 0:01:47,000
with the biological, hormonal, physical changes of puberty

33
0:01:47.753,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and ends at the age at which an individual attains

34
0:01:51.038,000 --> 0:01:54,000
a stable, independent role in society.

35
0:01:54.489,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:56.279,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It can go on a long time. (Laughter)

37
0:01:59.044,000 --> 0:02:02,000
One of the brain regions that changes most dramatically

38
0:02:02.063,000 --> 0:02:05,000
during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex.

39
0:02:05.327,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So this is a model of the human brain,

40
0:02:08.304,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and this is prefrontal cortex, right at the front.

41
0:02:11.184,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area.

42
0:02:13.693,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It's proportionally much bigger in humans than

43
0:02:16.807,000 --> 0:02:19,000
in any other species, and it's involved in a whole range of

44
0:02:20.45,000 --> 0:02:23,000
high level cognitive functions, things like decision-making,

45
0:02:23.722,000 --> 0:02:25,000
planning, planning what you're going to do tomorrow

46
0:02:25.812,000 --> 0:02:27,000
or next week or next year, inhibiting

47
0:02:28.552,000 --> 0:02:3,000
inappropriate behavior, so stopping yourself saying

48
0:02:31.218,000 --> 0:02:33,000
something really rude or doing something really stupid.

49
0:02:34.143,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It's also involved in social interaction,

50
0:02:35.921,000 --> 0:02:38,000
understanding other people, and self-awareness.

51
0:02:39.045,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So MRI studies looking at the development of this region

52
0:02:42.095,000 --> 0:02:44,000
have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development

53
0:02:44.565,000 --> 0:02:46,000
during the period of adolescence.

54
0:02:47.498,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So if you look at gray matter volume, for example,

55
0:02:50.456,000 --> 0:02:54,000
gray matter volume across age from age four to 22 years

56
0:02:55.305,000 --> 0:02:57,000
increases during childhood, which is what you can see

57
0:02:57.627,000 --> 0:03:,000
on this graph. It peaks in early adolescence.

58
0:03:01.38,000 --> 0:03:03,000
The arrows indicate peak gray matter volume

59
0:03:03.945,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in prefrontal cortex. You can see that that peak happens

60
0:03:07.411,000 --> 0:03:1,000
a couple of years later in boys relative to girls,

61
0:03:10.921,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and that's probably because boys go through puberty

62
0:03:12.76,000 --> 0:03:14,000
a couple of years later than girls on average,

63
0:03:15.012,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and then during adolescence, there's a significant decline

64
0:03:18.447,000 --> 0:03:2,000
in gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex.

65
0:03:21.132,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Now that might sound bad, but actually this is

66
0:03:23.157,000 --> 0:03:26,000
a really important developmental process, because

67
0:03:26.307,000 --> 0:03:3,000
gray matter contains cell bodies and connections

68
0:03:30.413,000 --> 0:03:33,000
between cells, the synapses, and this decline

69
0:03:33.867,000 --> 0:03:35,000
in gray matter volume during prefrontal cortex

70
0:03:36.612,000 --> 0:03:38,000
is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning,

71
0:03:39.504,000 --> 0:03:41,000
the elimination of unwanted synapses.

72
0:03:41.827,000 --> 0:03:44,000
This is a really important process. It's partly dependent

73
0:03:44.96,000 --> 0:03:47,000
on the environment that the animal or the human is in,

74
0:03:48.094,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and the synapses that are being used are strengthened,

75
0:03:51.538,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and synapses that aren't being used

76
0:03:53.471,000 --> 0:03:55,000
in that particular environment are pruned away.

77
0:03:55.803,000 --> 0:03:57,000
You can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush.

78
0:03:58.309,000 --> 0:04:,000
You prune away the weaker branches so that

79
0:04:01.149,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the remaining, important branches, can grow stronger,

80
0:04:04.187,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and this process, which effectively fine-tunes brain tissue

81
0:04:08.113,000 --> 0:04:1,000
according to the species-specific environment,

82
0:04:10.78,000 --> 0:04:12,000
is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions

83
0:04:13.695,000 --> 0:04:16,000
during the period of human adolescence.

84
0:04:17.249,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes

85
0:04:20.95,000 --> 0:04:23,000
in the adolescent brain is using functional MRI

86
0:04:24.202,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to look at changes in brain activity across age.

87
0:04:27.475,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So I'll just give you an example from my lab.

88
0:04:29.117,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So in my lab, we're interested in the social brain, that is

89
0:04:32.678,000 --> 0:04:35,000
the network of brain regions that we use to understand

90
0:04:36.262,000 --> 0:04:38,000
other people and to interact with other people.

91
0:04:38.695,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So I like to show a photograph of a soccer game

92
0:04:42.461,000 --> 0:04:46,000
to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work.

93
0:04:46.868,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So this is a soccer game. (Laughter)

94
0:04:48.301,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Michael Owen has just missed a goal, and he's lying

95
0:04:50.943,000 --> 0:04:52,000
on the ground, and the first aspect of the social brain

96
0:04:53.745,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic

97
0:04:56.704,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and instinctive social emotional responses are,

98
0:04:59.754,000 --> 0:05:01,000
so within a split second of Michael Owen missing this goal,

99
0:05:02.718,000 --> 0:05:03,000
everyone is doing the same thing with their arms

100
0:05:04.528,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and the same thing with their face, even Michael Owen

101
0:05:06.331,000 --> 0:05:07,000
as he slides along the grass, is doing the same thing

102
0:05:08.155,000 --> 0:05:1,000
with his arms, and presumably has a similar

103
0:05:10.424,000 --> 0:05:11,000
facial expression, and the only people who don't

104
0:05:12.398,000 --> 0:05:15,000
are the guys in yellow at the back — (Laughs) —

105
0:05:15.859,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and I think they're on the wrong end of the stadium,

106
0:05:18.402,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and they're doing another social emotional response

107
0:05:20.697,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that we all instantly recognize, and that's the second aspect

108
0:05:23.332,000 --> 0:05:26,000
of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates,

109
0:05:26.968,000 --> 0:05:29,000
how good we are at reading other people's behavior,

110
0:05:30.35,000 --> 0:05:32,000
their actions, their gestures, their facial expressions,

111
0:05:33.027,000 --> 0:05:36,000
in terms of their underlying emotions and mental states.

112
0:05:36.843,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So you don't have to ask any of these guys.

113
0:05:38.62,000 --> 0:05:4,000
You have a pretty good idea of what they're feeling

114
0:05:41.161,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and thinking at this precise moment in time.

115
0:05:43.749,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So that's what we're interested in looking at in my lab.

116
0:05:45.505,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So in my lab, we bring adolescents and adults into the lab

117
0:05:49.093,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to have a brain scan, we give them some kind of task

118
0:05:51.478,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that involves thinking about other people, their minds,

119
0:05:54.772,000 --> 0:05:56,000
their mental states, their emotions, and one of the findings

120
0:05:57.666,000 --> 0:05:59,000
that we've found several times now, as have other labs

121
0:06:00.512,000 --> 0:06:03,000
around the world, is part of the prefrontal cortex called

122
0:06:03.73,000 --> 0:06:06,000
medial prefrontal cortex, which is shown in blue on the slide,

123
0:06:06.948,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and it's right in the middle of prefrontal cortex

124
0:06:09.704,000 --> 0:06:11,000
in the midline of your head.

125
0:06:12.102,000 --> 0:06:15,000
This region is more active in adolescents when they make

126
0:06:15.385,000 --> 0:06:17,000
these social decisions and think about other people

127
0:06:17.512,000 --> 0:06:19,000
than it is in adults, and this is actually a meta-analysis

128
0:06:20.313,000 --> 0:06:23,000
of nine different studies in this area from labs around

129
0:06:23.553,000 --> 0:06:25,000
the world, and they all show the same thing, that activity

130
0:06:26.253,000 --> 0:06:29,000
in this medial prefrontal cortex area decreases

131
0:06:29.623,000 --> 0:06:31,000
during the period of adolescence.

132
0:06:32.07,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And we think that might be because adolescents and adults

133
0:06:34.714,000 --> 0:06:36,000
use a different mental approach, a different

134
0:06:37.08,000 --> 0:06:4,000
cognitive strategy, to make social decisions,

135
0:06:40.498,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies

136
0:06:44.014,000 --> 0:06:45,000
whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them

137
0:06:45.991,000 --> 0:06:47,000
some kind of behavioral task, and I'll just give you

138
0:06:48.535,000 --> 0:06:51,000
another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab.

139
0:06:51.745,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So imagine that you're the participant in one of our

140
0:06:54.393,000 --> 0:06:55,000
experiments. You come into the lab,

141
0:06:56.118,000 --> 0:06:58,000
you see this computerized task.

142
0:06:58.792,000 --> 0:07:,000
In this task, you see a set of shelves.

143
0:07:01.582,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Now, there are objects on these shelves, on some of them,

144
0:07:04.399,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and you'll notice there's a guy standing behind the set

145
0:07:07.37,000 --> 0:07:1,000
of shelves, and there are some objects that he can't see.

146
0:07:10.955,000 --> 0:07:12,000
They're occluded, from his point of view, with a kind of

147
0:07:13.234,000 --> 0:07:15,000
gray piece of wood.

148
0:07:15.878,000 --> 0:07:18,000
This is the same set of shelves from his point of view.

149
0:07:19.362,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Notice that there are only some objects that he can see,

150
0:07:22.855,000 --> 0:07:24,000
whereas there are many more objects that you can see.

151
0:07:25.307,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Now your task is to move objects around.

152
0:07:27.503,000 --> 0:07:29,000
The director, standing behind the set of shelves,

153
0:07:29.865,000 --> 0:07:31,000
is going to direct you to move objects around,

154
0:07:32.61,000 --> 0:07:33,000
but remember, he's not going to ask you to move objects

155
0:07:34.504,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that he can't see. This introduces a really interesting

156
0:07:38.224,000 --> 0:07:4,000
condition whereby there's a kind of conflict

157
0:07:40.417,000 --> 0:07:43,000
between your perspective and the director's perspective.

158
0:07:43.585,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So imagine he tells you to move the top truck left.

159
0:07:46.825,000 --> 0:07:48,000
There are three trucks there. You're going to instinctively

160
0:07:48.871,000 --> 0:07:5,000
go for the white truck, because that's the top truck

161
0:07:51.021,000 --> 0:07:53,000
from your perspective, but then you have to remember,

162
0:07:53.839,000 --> 0:07:55,000
"Oh, he can't see that truck, so he must mean

163
0:07:55.898,000 --> 0:07:57,000
me to move the blue truck," which is the top truck

164
0:07:58.655,000 --> 0:08:,000
from his perspective. Now believe it or not,

165
0:08:01.3,000 --> 0:08:03,000
normal, healthy, intelligent adults like you make errors

166
0:08:04.251,000 --> 0:08:07,000
about 50 percent of the time on that kind of trial.

167
0:08:07.391,000 --> 0:08:09,000
They move the white truck instead of the blue truck.

168
0:08:10.234,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults,

169
0:08:13.55,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and we also have a control condition

170
0:08:15.104,000 --> 0:08:19,000
where there's no director and instead we give people a rule.

171
0:08:19.165,000 --> 0:08:2,000
We tell them, okay, we're going to do exactly the same thing

172
0:08:21.079,000 --> 0:08:23,000
but this time there's no director. Instead you've got to

173
0:08:23.916,000 --> 0:08:26,000
ignore objects with the dark gray background.

174
0:08:27.123,000 --> 0:08:29,000
You'll see that this is exactly the same condition, only

175
0:08:29.823,000 --> 0:08:31,000
in the no-director condition they just have to remember

176
0:08:32.669,000 --> 0:08:35,000
to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule, whereas

177
0:08:35.74,000 --> 0:08:36,000
in the director condition, they have to remember

178
0:08:37.42,000 --> 0:08:4,000
to take into account the director's perspective

179
0:08:40.961,000 --> 0:08:44,000
in order to guide their ongoing behavior.

180
0:08:45.258,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Okay, so if I just show you the percentage errors

181
0:08:47.868,000 --> 0:08:49,000
in a large developmental study we did,

182
0:08:50.434,000 --> 0:08:53,000
this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood,

183
0:08:53.988,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and what you're going to see is the percentage errors

184
0:08:55.198,000 --> 0:08:56,000
in the adult group in both conditions,

185
0:08:57.187,000 --> 0:09:,000
so the gray is the director condition, and you see

186
0:09:00.458,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that our intelligent adults are making errors about 50 percent

187
0:09:03.031,000 --> 0:09:05,000
of the time, whereas they make far fewer errors

188
0:09:05.746,000 --> 0:09:07,000
when there's no director present, when they just have

189
0:09:07.774,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background.

190
0:09:10.855,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Developmentally, these two conditions develop

191
0:09:13.523,000 --> 0:09:15,000
in exactly the same way. Between late childhood

192
0:09:16.446,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and mid-adolescence, there's an improvement,

193
0:09:18.687,000 --> 0:09:21,000
in other words a reduction of errors, in both of these trials,

194
0:09:22.038,000 --> 0:09:23,000
in both of these conditions.

195
0:09:23.158,000 --> 0:09:25,000
But it's when you compare the last two groups,

196
0:09:25.443,000 --> 0:09:26,000
the mid-adolescent group and the adult group

197
0:09:27.395,000 --> 0:09:3,000
where things get really interesting, because there, there is

198
0:09:30.555,000 --> 0:09:33,000
no continued improvement in the no-director condition.

199
0:09:33.593,000 --> 0:09:35,000
In other words, everything you need to do in order to

200
0:09:36.523,000 --> 0:09:38,000
remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed

201
0:09:39.229,000 --> 0:09:41,000
by mid-adolescence, whereas in contrast,

202
0:09:41.76,000 --> 0:09:43,000
if you look at the last two gray bars, there's still

203
0:09:44.157,000 --> 0:09:47,000
a significant improvement in the director condition

204
0:09:47.307,000 --> 0:09:49,000
between mid-adolescence and adulthood, and what

205
0:09:49.748,000 --> 0:09:52,000
this means is that the ability to take into account someone

206
0:09:53.124,000 --> 0:09:56,000
else's perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior,

207
0:09:56.409,000 --> 0:09:58,000
which is something, by the way, that we do in everyday life all

208
0:09:58.668,000 --> 0:10:02,000
the time, is still developing in mid-to-late adolescence.

209
0:10:03.274,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you

210
0:10:05.814,000 --> 0:10:07,000
sometimes think they have problems taking other people's

211
0:10:08.223,000 --> 0:10:11,000
perspectives, you're right. They do. And this is why.

212
0:10:11.979,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So we sometimes laugh about teenagers.

213
0:10:15.492,000 --> 0:10:18,000
They're parodied, sometimes even demonized in the media

214
0:10:19.355,000 --> 0:10:22,000
for their kind of typical teenage behavior. They take risks,

215
0:10:22.882,000 --> 0:10:24,000
they're sometimes moody, they're very self-conscious.

216
0:10:25.653,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I have a really nice anecdote from a friend of mine

217
0:10:28.146,000 --> 0:10:3,000
who said that the thing he noticed most

218
0:10:30.633,000 --> 0:10:32,000
about his teenage daughters before and after puberty

219
0:10:33.614,000 --> 0:10:35,000
was their level of embarrassment in front of him.

220
0:10:35.874,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So, he said, "Before puberty, if my two daughters

221
0:10:38.363,000 --> 0:10:4,000
were messing around in a shop, I'd say, 'Hey,

222
0:10:40.617,000 --> 0:10:41,000
stop messing around and I'll sing your favorite song,'

223
0:10:42.366,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and instantly they'd stop messing around and he'd sing

224
0:10:44.267,000 --> 0:10:47,000
their favorite song. After puberty, that became the threat.

225
0:10:47.738,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Laughter)

226
0:10:49.555,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The very notion of their dad singing in public

227
0:10:53.032,000 --> 0:10:55,000
was enough to make them behave.

228
0:10:55.395,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So people often ask,

229
0:10:56.823,000 --> 0:10:58,000
"Well, is adolescence a kind of recent phenomenon?

230
0:10:59.456,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Is it something we've invented recently in the West?"

231
0:11:01.578,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And actually, the answer is probably not. There are lots

232
0:11:04.246,000 --> 0:11:07,000
of descriptions of adolescence in history that sound

233
0:11:07.669,000 --> 0:11:09,000
very similar to the descriptions we use today.

234
0:11:09.826,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So there's a famous quote by Shakespeare from "The Winter's Tale"

235
0:11:14.059,000 --> 0:11:16,000
where he describes adolescence as follows:

236
0:11:16.834,000 --> 0:11:18,000
"I would there were no age between ten and

237
0:11:19.68,000 --> 0:11:22,000
three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the rest;

238
0:11:22.92,000 --> 0:11:24,000
for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches

239
0:11:25.011,000 --> 0:11:31,000
with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting." (Laughter)

240
0:11:31.234,000 --> 0:11:35,000
He then goes on to say, "Having said that, would any

241
0:11:35.768,000 --> 0:11:38,000
but these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty

242
0:11:38.913,000 --> 0:11:4,000
hunt in this weather?" (Laughter)

243
0:11:41.411,000 --> 0:11:43,000
So almost 400 years ago, Shakespeare was portraying

244
0:11:44.337,000 --> 0:11:46,000
adolescents in a very similar light to the light that we

245
0:11:47.061,000 --> 0:11:5,000
portray them in today, but today we try to understand

246
0:11:50.52,000 --> 0:11:53,000
their behavior in terms of the underlying changes

247
0:11:53.607,000 --> 0:11:54,000
that are going on in their brain.

248
0:11:55.545,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So for example, take risk-taking. We know that adolescents

249
0:11:59.153,000 --> 0:12:01,000
have a tendency to take risks. They do.

250
0:12:01.478,000 --> 0:12:03,000
They take more risks than children or adults,

251
0:12:04.11,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and they are particularly prone to taking risks

252
0:12:06.57,000 --> 0:12:08,000
when they're with their friends. There's an important drive

253
0:12:09.538,000 --> 0:12:11,000
to become independent from one's parents

254
0:12:12.024,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and to impress one's friends in adolescence.

255
0:12:14.848,000 --> 0:12:16,000
But now we try to understand that in terms of

256
0:12:17.447,000 --> 0:12:19,000
the development of a part of their brain called the limbic system,

257
0:12:20.44,000 --> 0:12:22,000
so I'm going to show you the limbic system in red

258
0:12:22.983,000 --> 0:12:23,000
in the slide behind me, and also on this brain.

259
0:12:24.848,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So the limbic system is right deep inside the brain,

260
0:12:27.957,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and it's involved in things like emotion processing

261
0:12:31.69,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and reward processing. It gives you the rewarding feeling

262
0:12:34.84,000 --> 0:12:37,000
out of doing fun things, including taking risks.

263
0:12:38.136,000 --> 0:12:4,000
It gives you the kick out of taking risks.

264
0:12:40.501,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And this region, the regions within the limbic system,

265
0:12:43.549,000 --> 0:12:46,000
have been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding

266
0:12:46.968,000 --> 0:12:49,000
feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults,

267
0:12:50.737,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and at the very same time, the prefrontal cortex,

268
0:12:54.439,000 --> 0:12:56,000
which you can see in blue in the slide here,

269
0:12:56.713,000 --> 0:12:58,000
which stops us taking excessive risks,

270
0:12:59.58,000 --> 0:13:02,000
is still very much in development in adolescents.

271
0:13:02.978,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So brain research has shown that the adolescent brain

272
0:13:06.645,000 --> 0:13:09,000
undergoes really quite profound development,

273
0:13:09.987,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and this has implications for education, for rehabilitation,

274
0:13:13.943,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and intervention. The environment, including teaching,

275
0:13:17.963,000 --> 0:13:2,000
can and does shape the developing adolescent brain,

276
0:13:21.372,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and yet it's only relatively recently that we have been

277
0:13:24.174,000 --> 0:13:26,000
routinely educating teenagers in the West.

278
0:13:26.679,000 --> 0:13:29,000
All four of my grandparents, for example, left school

279
0:13:30.432,000 --> 0:13:33,000
in their early adolescence. They had no choice.

280
0:13:34.266,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And that's still the case for many, many teenagers

281
0:13:37.04,000 --> 0:13:4,000
around the world today. Forty percent of teenagers

282
0:13:40.207,000 --> 0:13:44,000
don't have access to secondary school education.

283
0:13:44.429,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And yet, this is a period of life where the brain is

284
0:13:47.068,000 --> 0:13:49,000
particularly adaptable and malleable.

285
0:13:49.915,000 --> 0:13:52,000
It's a fantastic opportunity for learning and creativity.

286
0:13:53.685,000 --> 0:13:55,000
So what's sometimes seen as the problem

287
0:13:55.918,000 --> 0:13:57,000
with adolescents — heightened risk-taking, poor impulse

288
0:13:58.394,000 --> 0:14:01,000
control, self-consciousness — shouldn't be stigmatized.

289
0:14:02.336,000 --> 0:14:04,000
It actually reflects changes in the brain that provide

290
0:14:05.173,000 --> 0:14:07,000
an excellent opportunity for education

291
0:14:08.087,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and social development. Thank you. (Applause)

292
0:14:12.517,000 --> 0:14:19,000
(Applause)

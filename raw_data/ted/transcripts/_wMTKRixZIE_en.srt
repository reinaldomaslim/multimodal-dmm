1
0:00:14.28,000 --> 0:00:17,000
People returning to work after a career break:

2
0:00:17.84,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I call them relaunchers.

3
0:00:20.039,000 --> 0:00:23,000
These are people who have taken career breaks for elder care,

4
0:00:23.92,000 --> 0:00:24,000
for childcare reasons,

5
0:00:25.76,000 --> 0:00:26,000
pursuing a personal interest

6
0:00:27.48,000 --> 0:00:29,000
or a personal health issue.

7
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Closely related are career transitioners of all kinds:

8
0:00:33.56,000 --> 0:00:35,000
veterans, military spouses,

9
0:00:35.92,000 --> 0:00:37,000
retirees coming out of retirement

10
0:00:38.36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
or repatriating expats.

11
0:00:41.76,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Returning to work after a career break is hard

12
0:00:44.72,000 --> 0:00:47,000
because of a disconnect between the employers

13
0:00:47.76,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and the relaunchers.

14
0:00:49.68,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Employers can view hiring people with a gap on their resume

15
0:00:53.68,000 --> 0:00:55,000
as a high-risk proposition,

16
0:00:55.8,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and individuals on career break can have doubts about their abilities

17
0:00:59.68,000 --> 0:01:,000
to relaunch their careers,

18
0:01:01.28,000 --> 0:01:03,000
especially if they've been out for a long time.

19
0:01:04.32,000 --> 0:01:08,000
This disconnect is a problem that I'm trying to help solve.

20
0:01:09.64,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Now, successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field.

21
0:01:14.68,000 --> 0:01:15,000
This is Sami Kafala.

22
0:01:16.44,000 --> 0:01:18,000
He's a nuclear physicist in the UK

23
0:01:19.2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
who took a five-year career break to be home with his five children.

24
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The Singapore press recently wrote about nurses returning to work

25
0:01:28.12,000 --> 0:01:3,000
after long career breaks.

26
0:01:30.2,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And speaking of long career breaks,

27
0:01:32.24,000 --> 0:01:33,000
this is Mimi Kahn.

28
0:01:34.12,000 --> 0:01:37,000
She's a social worker in Orange County, California,

29
0:01:37.32,000 --> 0:01:4,000
who returned to work in a social services organization

30
0:01:40.68,000 --> 0:01:42,000
after a 25-year career break.

31
0:01:43.48,000 --> 0:01:45,000
That's the longest career break that I'm aware of.

32
0:01:46.28,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

33
0:01:48.84,000 --> 0:01:5,000
took a five-year career break early in her career.

34
0:01:52.72,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And this is Tracy Shapiro, who took a 13-year career break.

35
0:01:57.4,000 --> 0:02:,000
Tracy answered a call for essays by the Today Show

36
0:02:01.36,000 --> 0:02:03,000
from people who were trying to return to work

37
0:02:03.8,000 --> 0:02:04,000
but having a difficult time of it.

38
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Tracy wrote in that she was a mom of five who loved her time at home,

39
0:02:10.64,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but she had gone through a divorce and needed to return to work,

40
0:02:14.2,000 --> 0:02:16,000
plus she really wanted to bring work back into her life

41
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
because she loved working.

42
0:02:19.52,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Tracy was doing what so many of us do

43
0:02:22.12,000 --> 0:02:25,000
when we feel like we've put in a good day in the job search.

44
0:02:25.88,000 --> 0:02:27,000
She was looking for a finance or accounting role,

45
0:02:28.88,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and she had just spent the last nine months

46
0:02:31.6,000 --> 0:02:34,000
very diligently researching companies online

47
0:02:34.92,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and applying for jobs with no results.

48
0:02:38.12,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I met Tracy in June of 2011,

49
0:02:41.88,000 --> 0:02:44,000
when the Today Show asked me if I could work with her

50
0:02:45.44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
to see if I could help her turn things around.

51
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The first thing I told Tracy was she had to get out of the house.

52
0:02:51.64,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I told her she had to go public with her job search

53
0:02:54.4,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work.

54
0:02:58.68,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I also told her, "You are going to have a lot of conversations

55
0:03:02.48,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that don't go anywhere.

56
0:03:04.08,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Expect that, and don't be discouraged by it.

57
0:03:07.36,000 --> 0:03:08,000
There will be a handful

58
0:03:08.96,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that ultimately lead to a job opportunity."

59
0:03:12.68,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I'll tell you what happened with Tracy in a little bit,

60
0:03:15.32,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but I want to share with you a discovery that I made

61
0:03:17.773,000 --> 0:03:18,000
when I was returning to work

62
0:03:19.52,000 --> 0:03:23,000
after my own career break of 11 years out of the full-time workforce.

63
0:03:23.64,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And that is, that people's view of you is frozen in time.

64
0:03:29.32,000 --> 0:03:32,000
What I mean by this is, when you start to get in touch with people

65
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and you get back in touch with those people from the past,

66
0:03:35.76,000 --> 0:03:38,000
the people with whom you worked or went to school,

67
0:03:39.04,000 --> 0:03:41,000
they are going to remember you as you were

68
0:03:41.8,000 --> 0:03:42,000
before your career break.

69
0:03:43.64,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And that's even if your sense of self has diminished over time,

70
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
as happens with so many of us

71
0:03:49.28,000 --> 0:03:52,000
the farther removed we are from our professional identities.

72
0:03:53.2,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So for example, you might think of yourself

73
0:03:55.92,000 --> 0:03:56,000
as someone who looks like this.

74
0:03:57.8,000 --> 0:04:01,000
This is me, crazy after a day of driving around in my minivan.

75
0:04:02.12,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Or here I am in the kitchen.

76
0:04:04.76,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But those people from the past,

77
0:04:07.32,000 --> 0:04:09,000
they don't know about any of this.

78
0:04:09.56,000 --> 0:04:11,000
They only remember you as you were,

79
0:04:12.12,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and it's a great confidence boost to be back in touch with these people

80
0:04:16.32,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and hear their enthusiasm about your interest in returning to work.

81
0:04:21.44,000 --> 0:04:25,000
There's one more thing I remember vividly from my own career break.

82
0:04:25.56,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And that was that I hardly kept up with the business news.

83
0:04:28.959,000 --> 0:04:29,000
My background is in finance,

84
0:04:30.6,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and I hardly kept up with any news

85
0:04:33.04,000 --> 0:04:35,000
when I was home caring for my four young children.

86
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So I was afraid I'd go into an interview

87
0:04:39.4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and start talking about a company that didn't exist anymore.

88
0:04:43.2,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So I had to resubscribe to the Wall Street Journal

89
0:04:46.76,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and read it for a good six months cover to cover before I felt

90
0:04:50.24,000 --> 0:04:53,000
like I had a handle on what was going on in the business world again.

91
0:04:55.88,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce,

92
0:04:59.56,000 --> 0:05:,000
and here's why.

93
0:05:01.32,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Think about our life stage:

94
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
for those of us who took career breaks for childcare reasons,

95
0:05:06.84,000 --> 0:05:07,000
we have fewer or no maternity leaves.

96
0:05:08.84,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We did that already.

97
0:05:10.36,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We have fewer spousal or partner job relocations.

98
0:05:13.72,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We're in a more settled time of life.

99
0:05:16.2,000 --> 0:05:17,000
We have great work experience.

100
0:05:18.04,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We have a more mature perspective.

101
0:05:20.08,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We're not trying to find ourselves at an employer's expense.

102
0:05:23.68,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Plus we have an energy, an enthusiasm about returning to work

103
0:05:27.92,000 --> 0:05:29,000
precisely because we've been away from it for a while.

104
0:05:31.6,000 --> 0:05:33,000
On the flip side, I speak with employers,

105
0:05:34.24,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and here are two concerns that employers have

106
0:05:36.8,000 --> 0:05:37,000
about hiring relaunchers.

107
0:05:38.72,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The first one is, employers are worried that relaunchers

108
0:05:41.8,000 --> 0:05:43,000
are technologically obsolete.

109
0:05:44.4,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Now, I can tell you,

110
0:05:45.68,000 --> 0:05:48,000
having been technologically obsolete myself at one point,

111
0:05:49.28,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that it's a temporary condition.

112
0:05:51.52,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I had done my financial analysis so long ago that I used Lotus 1-2-3.

113
0:05:57.68,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I don't know if anyone can even remember back that far,

114
0:06:00.64,000 --> 0:06:02,000
but I had to relearn it on Excel.

115
0:06:02.88,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It actually wasn't that hard. A lot of the commands are the same.

116
0:06:06.6,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I found PowerPoint much more challenging,

117
0:06:08.84,000 --> 0:06:1,000
but now I use PowerPoint all the time.

118
0:06:11.96,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I tell relaunchers that employers expect them to come to the table

119
0:06:16.64,000 --> 0:06:19,000
with a working knowledge of basic office management software.

120
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And if they're not up to speed,

121
0:06:21.92,000 --> 0:06:23,000
then it's their responsibility to get there.

122
0:06:24.32,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And they do.

123
0:06:25.96,000 --> 0:06:28,000
The second area of concern that employers have about relaunchers

124
0:06:29.6,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is they're worried that relaunchers don't know what they want to do.

125
0:06:33.44,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I tell relaunchers that they need to do the hard work

126
0:06:36.68,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to figure out whether their interests and skills have changed

127
0:06:40.2,000 --> 0:06:41,000
or have not changed

128
0:06:41.8,000 --> 0:06:42,000
while they have been on career break.

129
0:06:43.64,000 --> 0:06:45,000
That's not the employer's job.

130
0:06:45.92,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It's the relauncher's responsibility to demonstrate to the employer

131
0:06:50.52,000 --> 0:06:51,000
where they can add the most value.

132
0:06:54.56,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Back in 2010 I started noticing something.

133
0:06:58.4,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I had been tracking return to work programs since 2008,

134
0:07:02.56,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and in 2010, I started noticing

135
0:07:05.88,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the use of a short-term paid work opportunity,

136
0:07:09.8,000 --> 0:07:11,000
whether it was called an internship or not,

137
0:07:12.28,000 --> 0:07:14,000
but an internship-like experience,

138
0:07:14.64,000 --> 0:07:17,000
as a way for professionals to return to work.

139
0:07:17.8,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee

140
0:07:20.6,000 --> 0:07:23,000
start corporate reentry internship programs.

141
0:07:23.92,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I saw a returning engineer, a nontraditional reentry candidate,

142
0:07:29.12,000 --> 0:07:32,000
apply for an entry-level internship program in the military,

143
0:07:32.96,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and then get a permanent job afterward.

144
0:07:35.88,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I saw two universities integrate internships

145
0:07:39.6,000 --> 0:07:42,000
into mid-career executive education programs.

146
0:07:43.2,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So I wrote a report about what I was seeing,

147
0:07:46.04,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and it became this article for Harvard Business Review

148
0:07:49.04,000 --> 0:07:5,000
called "The 40-Year-Old Intern."

149
0:07:50.96,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I have to thank the editors there for that title,

150
0:07:53.6,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and also for this artwork

151
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:59,000
where you can see the 40-year-old intern in the midst of all the college interns.

152
0:07:59.36,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And then, courtesy of Fox Business News,

153
0:08:02.56,000 --> 0:08:05,000
they called the concept "The 50-Year-Old Intern."

154
0:08:05.76,000 --> 0:08:08,000
(Laughter)

155
0:08:09.6,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So five of the biggest financial services companies

156
0:08:13.48,000 --> 0:08:17,000
have reentry internship programs for returning finance professionals.

157
0:08:17.64,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And at this point, hundreds of people have participated.

158
0:08:20.96,000 --> 0:08:21,000
These internships are paid,

159
0:08:22.76,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and the people who move on to permanent roles

160
0:08:25.52,000 --> 0:08:27,000
are commanding competitive salaries.

161
0:08:28.68,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And now, seven of the biggest engineering companies

162
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
are piloting reentry internship programs for returning engineers

163
0:08:36.48,000 --> 0:08:39,000
as part of an initiative with the Society of Women Engineers.

164
0:08:41.56,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Now, why are companies embracing the reentry internship?

165
0:08:46.44,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Because the internship allows the employer

166
0:08:49.44,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to base their hiring decision on an actual work sample

167
0:08:53.48,000 --> 0:08:55,000
instead of a series of interviews,

168
0:08:55.559,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and the employer does not have to make that permanent hiring decision

169
0:08:59.32,000 --> 0:09:01,000
until the internship period is over.

170
0:09:02.64,000 --> 0:09:05,000
This testing out period removes the perceived risk

171
0:09:06.56,000 --> 0:09:09,000
that some managers attach to hiring relaunchers,

172
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and they are attracting excellent candidates

173
0:09:12.84,000 --> 0:09:13,000
who are turning into great hires.

174
0:09:15.24,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Think about how far we have come.

175
0:09:17.56,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Before this, most employers were not interested

176
0:09:20.56,000 --> 0:09:22,000
in engaging with relaunchers at all.

177
0:09:22.92,000 --> 0:09:25,000
But now, not only are programs being developed

178
0:09:26.44,000 --> 0:09:28,000
specifically with relaunchers in mind,

179
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:31,000
but you can't even apply for these programs

180
0:09:31.52,000 --> 0:09:33,000
unless you have a gap on your résumé.

181
0:09:34.84,000 --> 0:09:36,000
This is the mark of real change,

182
0:09:36.96,000 --> 0:09:38,000
of true institutional shift,

183
0:09:39.24,000 --> 0:09:42,000
because if we can solve this problem for relaunchers,

184
0:09:42.8,000 --> 0:09:45,000
we can solve it for other career transitioners too.

185
0:09:46.12,000 --> 0:09:47,000
In fact, an employer just told me

186
0:09:48.08,000 --> 0:09:5,000
that their veterans return to work program

187
0:09:50.6,000 --> 0:09:53,000
is based on their reentry internship program.

188
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And there's no reason why there can't be a retiree internship program.

189
0:09:59.04,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Different pool, same concept.

190
0:10:02.4,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So let me tell you what happened with Tracy Shapiro.

191
0:10:04.88,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Remember that she had to tell everyone she knew

192
0:10:07.48,000 --> 0:10:09,000
about her interest in returning to work.

193
0:10:09.8,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Well, one critical conversation with another parent in her community

194
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
led to a job offer for Tracy,

195
0:10:16.12,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and it was an accounting job in a finance department.

196
0:10:18.92,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But it was a temp job.

197
0:10:20.8,000 --> 0:10:22,000
The company told her there was a possibility

198
0:10:23.28,000 --> 0:10:26,000
it could turn into something more, but no guarantees.

199
0:10:26.84,000 --> 0:10:28,000
This was in the fall of 2011.

200
0:10:29.72,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Tracy loved this company, and she loved the people

201
0:10:32.76,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and the office was less than 10 minutes from her house.

202
0:10:35.84,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So even though she had a second job offer

203
0:10:38.08,000 --> 0:10:4,000
at another company for a permanent full-time role,

204
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:44,000
she decided to take her chances with this internship

205
0:10:44.24,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and hope for the best.

206
0:10:47.32,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Well, she ended up blowing away all of their expectations,

207
0:10:50.4,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and the company not only made her a permanent offer

208
0:10:52.92,000 --> 0:10:54,000
at the beginning of 2012,

209
0:10:55.04,000 --> 0:10:57,000
but they made it even more interesting and challenging,

210
0:10:57.68,000 --> 0:10:59,000
because they knew what Tracy could handle.

211
0:11:00.4,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Fast forward to 2015,

212
0:11:02.88,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Tracy's been promoted.

213
0:11:04.48,000 --> 0:11:06,000
They've paid for her to get her MBA at night.

214
0:11:06.92,000 --> 0:11:09,000
She's even hired another relauncher to work for her.

215
0:11:11.84,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Tracy's temp job was a tryout,

216
0:11:15.24,000 --> 0:11:16,000
just like an internship,

217
0:11:16.92,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and it ended up being a win for both Tracy and her employer.

218
0:11:23.6,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Now, my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept

219
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:3,000
to more and more employers.

220
0:11:30.76,000 --> 0:11:31,000
But in the meantime,

221
0:11:32.6,000 --> 0:11:35,000
if you are returning to work after a career break,

222
0:11:35.84,000 --> 0:11:41,000
don't hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship-like arrangement

223
0:11:41.88,000 --> 0:11:46,000
to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program.

224
0:11:47.52,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Be their first success story,

225
0:11:49.84,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and you can be the example for more relaunchers to come.

226
0:11:53.92,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Thank you.

227
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
(Applause)

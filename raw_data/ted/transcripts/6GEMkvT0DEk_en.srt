0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Hi, my name is Marcin --

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
farmer, technologist.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I was born in Poland, now in the U.S.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I started a group called Open Source Ecology.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
We've identified the 50 most important machines

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that we think it takes for modern life to exist --

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
things from tractors,

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
bread ovens, circuit makers.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Then we set out to create

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
an open source, DIY, do it yourself version

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that anyone can build and maintain

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
at a fraction of the cost.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
We call this the Global Village Construction Set.

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So let me tell you a story.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So I finished my 20s

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
with a Ph.D. in fusion energy,

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and I discovered I was useless.

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I had no practical skills.

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
The world presented me with options,

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and I took them.

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle.

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So I started a farm in Missouri

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and learned about the economics of farming.

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I bought a tractor -- then it broke.

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I paid to get it repaired --

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
then it broke again.

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Then pretty soon,

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I was broke too.

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I realized

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I needed

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
to start a sustainable farm and settlement

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
just didn't exist yet.

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I needed tools that were robust, modular,

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
highly efficient and optimized,

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
low-cost,

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime,

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
not designed for obsolescence.

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I found that I would have to build them myself.

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So I did just that.

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And I tested them.

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And I found that industrial productivity

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
can be achieved on a small scale.

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
So then I published the 3D designs,

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
schematics,

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
instructional videos and budgets

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
on a wiki.

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Then contributors from all over the world

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
began showing up, prototyping new machines

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
during dedicated project visits.

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So far, we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines.

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And now the project

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
is beginning to grow on its own.

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We know that open source has succeeded

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
with tools for managing knowledge and creativity.

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And the same is starting to happen with hardware too.

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
We're focusing on hardware

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
because it is hardware that can change people's lives

58
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
in such tangible material ways.

59
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
If we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing,

60
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential.

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
That's not only in the developing world.

62
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Our tools are being made

63
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
for the American farmer, builder, entrepreneur, maker.

64
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
We've seen lots of excitement from these people,

65
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
who can now start a construction business,

66
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
parts manufacturing,

67
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
organic CSA

68
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
or just selling power back to the grid.

69
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Our goal is a repository of published designs

70
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
so clear, so complete,

71
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that a single burned DVD

72
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is effectively a civilization starter kit.

73
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I've planted a hundred trees in a day.

74
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I've pressed 5,000 bricks in one day

75
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
from the dirt beneath my feet

76
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and built a tractor in six days.

77
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
From what I've seen, this is only the beginning.

78
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
If this idea is truly sound,

79
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
then the implications are significant.

80
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
A greater distribution of the means of production,

81
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
environmentally sound supply chains,

82
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and a newly relevant DIY maker culture

83
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
can hope to transcend

84
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
artificial scarcity.

85
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We're exploring the limits

86
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
of what we all can do to make a better world

87
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
with open hardware technology.

88
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Thank you.

89
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.167,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Hello, everyone.

2
0:00:15.531,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Sawubona.

3
0:00:20.412,000 --> 0:00:22,000
In South Africa, where I come from,

4
0:00:22.642,000 --> 0:00:24,000
"sawubona" is the Zulu word for "hello."

5
0:00:26.122,000 --> 0:00:28,000
There's a beautiful and powerful intention behind the word

6
0:00:28.868,000 --> 0:00:3,000
because "sawubona" literally translated means,

7
0:00:31.122,000 --> 0:00:34,000
"I see you, and by seeing you, I bring you into being."

8
0:00:35.538,000 --> 0:00:37,000
So beautiful, imagine being greeted like that.

9
0:00:40.093,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But what does it take in the way we see ourselves?

10
0:00:43.037,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Our thoughts, our emotions and our stories

11
0:00:45.807,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that help us to thrive

12
0:00:47.163,000 --> 0:00:49,000
in an increasingly complex and fraught world?

13
0:00:50.958,000 --> 0:00:53,000
This crucial question has been at the center of my life's work.

14
0:00:54.807,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Because how we deal with our inner world drives everything.

15
0:00:58.593,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Every aspect of how we love, how we live,

16
0:01:01.807,000 --> 0:01:03,000
how we parent and how we lead.

17
0:01:04.696,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The conventional view of emotions as good or bad,

18
0:01:08.505,000 --> 0:01:09,000
positive or negative,

19
0:01:10.196,000 --> 0:01:11,000
is rigid.

20
0:01:11.768,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And rigidity in the face of complexity is toxic.

21
0:01:16.093,000 --> 0:01:19,000
We need greater levels of emotional agility

22
0:01:19.411,000 --> 0:01:21,000
for true resilience and thriving.

23
0:01:23.302,000 --> 0:01:24,000
My journey with this calling

24
0:01:25.009,000 --> 0:01:28,000
began not in the hallowed halls of a university,

25
0:01:28.651,000 --> 0:01:3,000
but in the messy, tender business of life.

26
0:01:31.728,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I grew up in the white suburbs of apartheid South Africa,

27
0:01:35.387,000 --> 0:01:38,000
a country and community committed to not seeing.

28
0:01:38.934,000 --> 0:01:39,000
To denial.

29
0:01:40.578,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It's denial that makes 50 years of racist legislation possible

30
0:01:45.15,000 --> 0:01:48,000
while people convince themselves that they are doing nothing wrong.

31
0:01:49.461,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And yet, I first learned of the destructive power of denial

32
0:01:53.291,000 --> 0:01:54,000
at a personal level,

33
0:01:55.117,000 --> 0:01:59,000
before I understood what it was doing to the country of my birth.

34
0:02:01.85,000 --> 0:02:02,000
My father died on a Friday.

35
0:02:04.564,000 --> 0:02:06,000
He was 42 years old and I was 15.

36
0:02:07.802,000 --> 0:02:09,000
My mother whispered to me to go and say goodbye to my father

37
0:02:10.659,000 --> 0:02:11,000
before I went to school.

38
0:02:12.234,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So I put my backpack down and walked the passage that ran through

39
0:02:15.829,000 --> 0:02:17,000
to where the heart of our home my father lay dying of cancer.

40
0:02:19.526,000 --> 0:02:21,000
His eyes were closed, but he knew I was there.

41
0:02:22.997,000 --> 0:02:24,000
In his presence, I had always felt seen.

42
0:02:26.331,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I told him I loved him,

43
0:02:27.807,000 --> 0:02:29,000
said goodbye and headed off for my day.

44
0:02:31.984,000 --> 0:02:35,000
At school, I drifted from science to mathematics to history to biology,

45
0:02:36.096,000 --> 0:02:38,000
as my father slipped from the world.

46
0:02:38.889,000 --> 0:02:4,000
From May to July to September to November,

47
0:02:41.711,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I went about with my usual smile.

48
0:02:44.251,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I didn't drop a single grade.

49
0:02:46.673,000 --> 0:02:49,000
When asked how I was doing, I would shrug and say, "OK."

50
0:02:51.292,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I was praised for being strong.

51
0:02:54.108,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I was the master of being OK.

52
0:02:58.673,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But back home, we struggled --

53
0:03:00.279,000 --> 0:03:02,000
my father hadn't been able to keep his small business going

54
0:03:03.069,000 --> 0:03:04,000
during his illness.

55
0:03:04.252,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And my mother, alone, was grieving the love of her life

56
0:03:07.307,000 --> 0:03:08,000
trying to raise three children,

57
0:03:08.808,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and the creditors were knocking.

58
0:03:11.355,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We felt, as a family, financially and emotionally ravaged.

59
0:03:15.553,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And I began to spiral down, isolated, fast.

60
0:03:20.798,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I started to use food to numb my pain.

61
0:03:24.733,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Binging and purging.

62
0:03:26.893,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Refusing to accept the full weight of my grief.

63
0:03:31.125,000 --> 0:03:35,000
No one knew, and in a culture that values relentless positivity,

64
0:03:35.387,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I thought that no one wanted to know.

65
0:03:39.339,000 --> 0:03:43,000
But one person did not buy into my story of triumph over grief.

66
0:03:44.751,000 --> 0:03:47,000
My eighth-grade English teacher fixed me with burning blue eyes

67
0:03:48.292,000 --> 0:03:5,000
as she handed out blank notebooks.

68
0:03:51.598,000 --> 0:03:53,000
She said, "Write what you're feeling.

69
0:03:55.106,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Tell the truth.

70
0:03:56.876,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Write like nobody's reading."

71
0:04:00.093,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And just like that,

72
0:04:01.331,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I was invited to show up authentically to my grief and pain.

73
0:04:05.395,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It was a simple act

74
0:04:07.744,000 --> 0:04:09,000
but nothing short of a revolution for me.

75
0:04:11.04,000 --> 0:04:15,000
It was this revolution that started in this blank notebook

76
0:04:15.365,000 --> 0:04:17,000
30 years ago

77
0:04:17.628,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that shaped my life's work.

78
0:04:20.117,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The secret, silent correspondence with myself.

79
0:04:24.656,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Like a gymnast,

80
0:04:25.856,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I started to move beyond the rigidity of denial

81
0:04:30.411,000 --> 0:04:32,000
into what I've now come to call

82
0:04:32.539,000 --> 0:04:33,000
emotional agility.

83
0:04:38.187,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Life's beauty is inseparable from its fragility.

84
0:04:43.036,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We are young until we are not.

85
0:04:45.807,000 --> 0:04:46,000
We walk down the streets sexy

86
0:04:47.704,000 --> 0:04:49,000
until one day we realize that we are unseen.

87
0:04:53.488,000 --> 0:04:55,000
We nag our children and one day realize

88
0:04:55.733,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that there is silence where that child once was,

89
0:04:58.014,000 --> 0:04:59,000
now making his or her way in the world.

90
0:05:01.009,000 --> 0:05:05,000
We are healthy until a diagnosis brings us to our knees.

91
0:05:07.009,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The only certainty is uncertainty,

92
0:05:09.375,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and yet we are not navigating this frailty successfully or sustainably.

93
0:05:14.164,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The World Health Organization tells us that depression

94
0:05:17.196,000 --> 0:05:2,000
is now the single leading cause of disability globally --

95
0:05:21.585,000 --> 0:05:22,000
outstripping cancer,

96
0:05:23.41,000 --> 0:05:24,000
outstripping heart disease.

97
0:05:26.411,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And at a time of greater complexity,

98
0:05:30.529,000 --> 0:05:33,000
unprecedented technological, political and economic change,

99
0:05:34.895,000 --> 0:05:35,000
we are seeing how people's tendency

100
0:05:36.696,000 --> 0:05:4,000
is more and more to lock down into rigid responses to their emotions.

101
0:05:42.371,000 --> 0:05:45,000
On the one hand we might obsessively brood on our feelings.

102
0:05:46.387,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Getting stuck inside our heads.

103
0:05:48.735,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Hooked on being right.

104
0:05:51.085,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Or victimized by our news feed.

105
0:05:55.124,000 --> 0:05:57,000
On the other, we might bottle our emotions,

106
0:05:57.172,000 --> 0:05:58,000
pushing them aside

107
0:05:59.18,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and permitting only those emotions deemed legitimate.

108
0:06:04.068,000 --> 0:06:07,000
In a survey I recently conducted with over 70,000 people,

109
0:06:07.262,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I found that a third of us --

110
0:06:09.704,000 --> 0:06:1,000
a third --

111
0:06:11.466,000 --> 0:06:15,000
either judge ourselves for having so-called "bad emotions,"

112
0:06:16.39,000 --> 0:06:17,000
like sadness,

113
0:06:18.208,000 --> 0:06:19,000
anger or even grief.

114
0:06:22.057,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Or actively try to push aside these feelings.

115
0:06:27.273,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We do this not only to ourselves,

116
0:06:28.947,000 --> 0:06:3,000
but also to people we love, like our children --

117
0:06:31.225,000 --> 0:06:35,000
we may inadvertently shame them out of emotions seen as negative,

118
0:06:35.847,000 --> 0:06:37,000
jump to a solution,

119
0:06:37.895,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and fail to help them

120
0:06:39.399,000 --> 0:06:42,000
to see these emotions as inherently valuable.

121
0:06:45.03,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Normal, natural emotions are now seen as good or bad.

122
0:06:52.474,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And being positive has become a new form of moral correctness.

123
0:06:59.522,000 --> 0:07:02,000
People with cancer are automatically told to just stay positive.

124
0:07:06.434,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Women, to stop being so angry.

125
0:07:11.191,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And the list goes on.

126
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It's a tyranny.

127
0:07:16.303,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It's a tyranny of positivity.

128
0:07:20.752,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And it's cruel.

129
0:07:23.021,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Unkind.

130
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And ineffective.

131
0:07:27.728,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And we do it to ourselves,

132
0:07:30.284,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and we do it to others.

133
0:07:33.373,000 --> 0:07:35,000
If there's one common feature

134
0:07:36.094,000 --> 0:07:39,000
of brooding, bottling or false positivity, it's this:

135
0:07:40.666,000 --> 0:07:42,000
they are all rigid responses.

136
0:07:44.586,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And if there's a single lesson we can learn

137
0:07:46.69,000 --> 0:07:48,000
from the inevitable fall of apartheid

138
0:07:49.507,000 --> 0:07:51,000
it is that rigid denial doesn't work.

139
0:07:53.642,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It's unsustainable.

140
0:07:55.967,000 --> 0:07:57,000
For individuals, for families,

141
0:07:58.855,000 --> 0:07:59,000
for societies.

142
0:08:00.783,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And as we watch the ice caps melt,

143
0:08:04.887,000 --> 0:08:06,000
it is unsustainable for our planet.

144
0:08:09.831,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Research on emotional suppression shows

145
0:08:11.72,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that when emotions are pushed aside or ignored,

146
0:08:14.712,000 --> 0:08:15,000
they get stronger.

147
0:08:16.664,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Psychologists call this amplification.

148
0:08:18.902,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Like that delicious chocolate cake in the refrigerator --

149
0:08:23.061,000 --> 0:08:24,000
the more you try to ignore it ...

150
0:08:26.124,000 --> 0:08:29,000
(Laughter)

151
0:08:30.744,000 --> 0:08:32,000
the greater its hold on you.

152
0:08:34.619,000 --> 0:08:37,000
You might think you're in control of unwanted emotions when you ignore them,

153
0:08:38.215,000 --> 0:08:4,000
but in fact they control you.

154
0:08:42.127,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Internal pain always comes out.

155
0:08:45.068,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Always.

156
0:08:46.863,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And who pays the price?

157
0:08:49.244,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We do.

158
0:08:50.673,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Our children,

159
0:08:52.696,000 --> 0:08:53,000
our colleagues,

160
0:08:55.354,000 --> 0:08:56,000
our communities.

161
0:09:01.354,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Now, don't get me wrong.

162
0:09:03.203,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I'm not anti-happiness.

163
0:09:06.213,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I like being happy.

164
0:09:07.546,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I'm a pretty happy person.

165
0:09:10.181,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But when we push aside normal emotions to embrace false positivity,

166
0:09:15.982,000 --> 0:09:2,000
we lose our capacity to develop skills to deal with the world as it is,

167
0:09:22.013,000 --> 0:09:23,000
not as we wish it to be.

168
0:09:24.95,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I've had hundreds of people tell me what they don't want to feel.

169
0:09:29.18,000 --> 0:09:3,000
They say things like,

170
0:09:30.902,000 --> 0:09:33,000
"I don't want to try because I don't want to feel disappointed."

171
0:09:35.022,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Or, "I just want this feeling to go away."

172
0:09:41.235,000 --> 0:09:42,000
"I understand," I say to them.

173
0:09:44.061,000 --> 0:09:46,000
"But you have dead people's goals."

174
0:09:47.187,000 --> 0:09:52,000
(Laughter)

175
0:09:52.561,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Applause)

176
0:09:58.878,000 --> 0:10:,000
Only dead people

177
0:10:00.942,000 --> 0:10:03,000
never get unwanted or inconvenienced by their feelings.

178
0:10:04.601,000 --> 0:10:05,000
(Laughter)

179
0:10:05.934,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Only dead people never get stressed,

180
0:10:09.101,000 --> 0:10:1,000
never get broken hearts,

181
0:10:11.196,000 --> 0:10:14,000
never experience the disappointment that comes with failure.

182
0:10:17.195,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Tough emotions are part of our contract with life.

183
0:10:21.949,000 --> 0:10:23,000
You don't get to have a meaningful career

184
0:10:24.298,000 --> 0:10:25,000
or raise a family

185
0:10:26.117,000 --> 0:10:28,000
or leave the world a better place

186
0:10:28.919,000 --> 0:10:3,000
without stress and discomfort.

187
0:10:32.173,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Discomfort is the price of admission to a meaningful life.

188
0:10:39.561,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So, how do we begin to dismantle rigidity

189
0:10:42.157,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and embrace emotional agility?

190
0:10:45.791,000 --> 0:10:46,000
As that young schoolgirl,

191
0:10:47.474,000 --> 0:10:5,000
when I leaned into those blank pages,

192
0:10:50.865,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I started to do away with feelings

193
0:10:53.278,000 --> 0:10:56,000
of what I should be experiencing.

194
0:10:57.254,000 --> 0:11:,000
And instead started to open my heart to what I did feel.

195
0:11:01.103,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Pain.

196
0:11:02.679,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And grief.

197
0:11:04.838,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And loss.

198
0:11:06.401,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And regret.

199
0:11:09.972,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Research now shows

200
0:11:12.577,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that the radical acceptance of all of our emotions --

201
0:11:15.934,000 --> 0:11:16,000
even the messy, difficult ones --

202
0:11:17.617,000 --> 0:11:19,000
is the cornerstone to resilience, thriving,

203
0:11:20.388,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and true, authentic happiness.

204
0:11:25.268,000 --> 0:11:29,000
But emotional agility is more that just an acceptance of emotions.

205
0:11:30.229,000 --> 0:11:32,000
We also know that accuracy matters.

206
0:11:33.228,000 --> 0:11:37,000
In my own research, I found that words are essential.

207
0:11:37.775,000 --> 0:11:4,000
We often use quick and easy labels to describe our feelings.

208
0:11:40.831,000 --> 0:11:42,000
"I'm stressed" is the most common one I hear.

209
0:11:43.49,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But there's a world of difference between stress and disappointment

210
0:11:46.895,000 --> 0:11:49,000
or stress and that knowing dread of "I'm in the wrong career."

211
0:11:51.804,000 --> 0:11:52,000
When we label our emotions accurately,

212
0:11:53.733,000 --> 0:11:56,000
we are more able to discern the precise cause of our feelings.

213
0:11:57.692,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And what scientists call the readiness potential in our brain

214
0:12:00.704,000 --> 0:12:03,000
is activated, allowing us to take concrete steps.

215
0:12:04.513,000 --> 0:12:06,000
But not just any steps -- the right steps for us.

216
0:12:07.442,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Because our emotions are data.

217
0:12:10.109,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Our emotions contain flashing lights to things that we care about.

218
0:12:14.72,000 --> 0:12:17,000
We tend not to feel strong emotion

219
0:12:17.815,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to stuff that doesn't mean anything in our worlds.

220
0:12:22.251,000 --> 0:12:24,000
If you feel rage when you read the news,

221
0:12:24.887,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that rage is a signpost, perhaps, that you value equity and fairness --

222
0:12:29.76,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and an opportunity to take active steps

223
0:12:31.76,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to shape your life in that direction.

224
0:12:35.093,000 --> 0:12:37,000
When we are open to the difficult emotions,

225
0:12:37.3,000 --> 0:12:4,000
we are able to generate responses that are values-aligned.

226
0:12:41.957,000 --> 0:12:42,000
But there's an important caveat.

227
0:12:43.966,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Emotions are data, they are not directives.

228
0:12:46.752,000 --> 0:12:49,000
We can show up to and mine our emotions for their values

229
0:12:49.918,000 --> 0:12:5,000
without needing to listen to them.

230
0:12:52.419,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Just like I can show up to my son in his frustration with his baby sister --

231
0:12:58.673,000 --> 0:13:,000
but not endorse his idea that he gets to give her away

232
0:13:01.263,000 --> 0:13:03,000
to the first stranger he sees in a shopping mall.

233
0:13:03.613,000 --> 0:13:04,000
(Laughter)

234
0:13:05.165,000 --> 0:13:08,000
We own our emotions, they don't own us.

235
0:13:09.52,000 --> 0:13:12,000
When we internalize the difference between how I feel in all my wisdom

236
0:13:13.347,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and what I do in a values-aligned action,

237
0:13:17.284,000 --> 0:13:2,000
we generate the pathway to our best selves

238
0:13:20.499,000 --> 0:13:21,000
via our emotions.

239
0:13:24.466,000 --> 0:13:26,000
So, what does this look like in practice?

240
0:13:28.474,000 --> 0:13:29,000
When you feel a strong, tough emotion,

241
0:13:30.316,000 --> 0:13:31,000
don't race for the emotional exits.

242
0:13:33.203,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Learn its contours, show up to the journal of your hearts.

243
0:13:37.625,000 --> 0:13:38,000
What is the emotion telling you?

244
0:13:41.57,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And try not to say "I am," as in, "I'm angry" or "I'm sad."

245
0:13:45.395,000 --> 0:13:46,000
When you say "I am"

246
0:13:46.578,000 --> 0:13:48,000
it makes you sound as if you are the emotion.

247
0:13:49.149,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Whereas you are you, and the emotion is a data source.

248
0:13:52.577,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Instead, try to notice the feeling for what it is:

249
0:13:55.046,000 --> 0:13:56,000
"I'm noticing that I'm feeling sad"

250
0:13:56.758,000 --> 0:13:58,000
or "I'm noticing that I'm feeling angry."

251
0:14:00.037,000 --> 0:14:02,000
These are essential skills for us,

252
0:14:02.179,000 --> 0:14:04,000
our families, our communities.

253
0:14:04.458,000 --> 0:14:06,000
They're also critical to the workplace.

254
0:14:08.132,000 --> 0:14:09,000
In my research,

255
0:14:09.324,000 --> 0:14:12,000
when I looked at what helps people to bring the best of themselves to work,

256
0:14:12.887,000 --> 0:14:13,000
I found a powerful key contributor:

257
0:14:14.585,000 --> 0:14:15,000
individualized consideration.

258
0:14:17.084,000 --> 0:14:2,000
When people are allowed to feel their emotional truth,

259
0:14:20.87,000 --> 0:14:23,000
engagement, creativity and innovation flourish in the organization.

260
0:14:25.661,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Diversity isn't just people,

261
0:14:27.193,000 --> 0:14:29,000
it's also what's inside people.

262
0:14:29.558,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Including diversity of emotion.

263
0:14:34.425,000 --> 0:14:37,000
The most agile, resilient individuals, teams,

264
0:14:38.337,000 --> 0:14:4,000
organizations, families, communities

265
0:14:40.673,000 --> 0:14:42,000
are built on an openness to the normal human emotions.

266
0:14:44.189,000 --> 0:14:46,000
It's this that allows us to say,

267
0:14:46.522,000 --> 0:14:48,000
"What is my emotion telling me?"

268
0:14:48.624,000 --> 0:14:51,000
"Which action will bring me towards my values?"

269
0:14:51.705,000 --> 0:14:53,000
"Which will take me away from my values?"

270
0:14:55.436,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Emotional agility is the ability to be with your emotions

271
0:14:59.189,000 --> 0:15:01,000
with curiosity, compassion,

272
0:15:02.189,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and especially the courage to take values-connected steps.

273
0:15:07.891,000 --> 0:15:08,000
When I was little,

274
0:15:09.081,000 --> 0:15:11,000
I would wake up at night terrified by the idea of death.

275
0:15:11.915,000 --> 0:15:14,000
My father would comfort me with soft pats and kisses.

276
0:15:15.677,000 --> 0:15:16,000
But he would never lie.

277
0:15:18.738,000 --> 0:15:2,000
"We all die, Susie," he would say.

278
0:15:21.78,000 --> 0:15:22,000
"It's normal to be scared."

279
0:15:24.483,000 --> 0:15:27,000
He didn't try to invent a buffer between me and reality.

280
0:15:29.037,000 --> 0:15:3,000
It took me a while to understand

281
0:15:30.911,000 --> 0:15:32,000
the power of how he guided me through those nights.

282
0:15:34.228,000 --> 0:15:38,000
What he showed me is that courage is not an absence of fear;

283
0:15:39.579,000 --> 0:15:41,000
courage is fear walking.

284
0:15:44.791,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Neither of us knew that in 10 short years,

285
0:15:47.054,000 --> 0:15:48,000
he would be gone.

286
0:15:48.95,000 --> 0:15:5,000
And that time for each of us is all too precious

287
0:15:51.878,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and all too brief.

288
0:15:54.494,000 --> 0:15:56,000
But when our moment comes

289
0:15:57.311,000 --> 0:15:59,000
to face our fragility,

290
0:15:59.533,000 --> 0:16:,000
in that ultimate time,

291
0:16:01.256,000 --> 0:16:02,000
it will ask us,

292
0:16:03.359,000 --> 0:16:04,000
"Are you agile?"

293
0:16:05.421,000 --> 0:16:06,000
"Are you agile?"

294
0:16:07.738,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Let the moment be an unreserved "yes."

295
0:16:12.381,000 --> 0:16:16,000
A "yes" born of a lifelong correspondence with your own heart.

296
0:16:17.784,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And in seeing yourself.

297
0:16:20.839,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Because in seeing yourself,

298
0:16:23.252,000 --> 0:16:25,000
you are also able to see others, too:

299
0:16:27.218,000 --> 0:16:3,000
the only sustainable way forward

300
0:16:30.665,000 --> 0:16:32,000
in a fragile, beautiful world.

301
0:16:34.972,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Sawubona.

302
0:16:36.442,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And thank you.

303
0:16:37.633,000 --> 0:16:38,000
(Laughter)

304
0:16:38.69,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Thank you.

305
0:16:39.865,000 --> 0:16:41,000
(Applause)

306
0:16:42.159,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Thank you.

307
0:16:43.444,000 --> 0:16:46,000
(Applause)

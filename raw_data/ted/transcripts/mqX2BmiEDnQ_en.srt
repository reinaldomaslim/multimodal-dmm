1
0:00:12.896,000 --> 0:00:15,000
We know more about other planets than our own,

2
0:00:17.446,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and today, I want to show you a new type of robot

3
0:00:20.693,000 --> 0:00:24,000
designed to help us better understand our own planet.

4
0:00:25.408,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It belongs to a category

5
0:00:27.044,000 --> 0:00:31,000
known in the oceanographic community as an unmanned surface vehicle, or USV.

6
0:00:32.665,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And it uses no fuel.

7
0:00:35.047,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Instead, it relies on wind power for propulsion.

8
0:00:39.005,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And yet, it can sail around the globe for months at a time.

9
0:00:43.474,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So I want to share with you why we built it,

10
0:00:46.376,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and what it means for you.

11
0:00:49.814,000 --> 0:00:53,000
A few years ago, I was on a sailboat making its way across the Pacific,

12
0:00:54.422,000 --> 0:00:56,000
from San Francisco to Hawaii.

13
0:00:57.296,000 --> 0:01:,000
I had just spent the past 10 years working nonstop,

14
0:01:00.674,000 --> 0:01:03,000
developing video games for hundreds of millions of users,

15
0:01:03.814,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and I wanted to take a step back and look at the big picture

16
0:01:07.359,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and get some much-needed thinking time.

17
0:01:09.918,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I was the navigator on board,

18
0:01:12.034,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and one evening, after a long session analyzing weather data

19
0:01:15.722,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and plotting our course,

20
0:01:17.375,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I came up on deck and saw this beautiful sunset.

21
0:01:20.814,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And a thought occurred to me:

22
0:01:22.747,000 --> 0:01:25,000
How much do we really know about our oceans?

23
0:01:27.252,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The Pacific was stretching all around me as far as the eye could see,

24
0:01:31.155,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and the waves were rocking our boat forcefully,

25
0:01:33.494,000 --> 0:01:36,000
a sort of constant reminder of its untold power.

26
0:01:37.291,000 --> 0:01:4,000
How much do we really know about our oceans?

27
0:01:41.235,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I decided to find out.

28
0:01:44.362,000 --> 0:01:47,000
What I quickly learned is that we don't know very much.

29
0:01:47.495,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The first reason is just how vast oceans are,

30
0:01:50.645,000 --> 0:01:52,000
covering 70 percent of the planet,

31
0:01:53.01,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and yet we know they drive complex planetary systems

32
0:01:56.579,000 --> 0:01:57,000
like global weather,

33
0:01:57.783,000 --> 0:01:59,000
which affect all of us on a daily basis,

34
0:02:00.252,000 --> 0:02:01,000
sometimes dramatically.

35
0:02:02.562,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And yet, those activities are mostly invisible to us.

36
0:02:06.944,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Ocean data is scarce by any standard.

37
0:02:11.268,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Back on land, I had grown used to accessing lots of sensors --

38
0:02:16.396,000 --> 0:02:17,000
billions of them, actually.

39
0:02:18.576,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But at sea, in situ data is scarce and expensive.

40
0:02:25.535,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Why? Because it relies on a small number of ships and buoys.

41
0:02:29.919,000 --> 0:02:31,000
How small a number was actually a great surprise.

42
0:02:33.329,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Our National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,

43
0:02:36.474,000 --> 0:02:37,000
better known as NOAA,

44
0:02:38.121,000 --> 0:02:4,000
only has 16 ships,

45
0:02:40.969,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and there are less than 200 buoys offshore globally.

46
0:02:45.77,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It is easy to understand why:

47
0:02:47.465,000 --> 0:02:49,000
the oceans are an unforgiving place,

48
0:02:49.629,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and to collect in situ data, you need a big ship,

49
0:02:52.987,000 --> 0:02:54,000
capable of carrying a vast amount of fuel

50
0:02:55.345,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and large crews,

51
0:02:57.187,000 --> 0:03:,000
costing hundreds of millions of dollars each,

52
0:03:00.39,000 --> 0:03:05,000
or, big buoys tethered to the ocean floor with a four-mile-long cable

53
0:03:06.513,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and weighted down by a set of train wheels,

54
0:03:09.532,000 --> 0:03:13,000
which is both dangerous to deploy and expensive to maintain.

55
0:03:14.628,000 --> 0:03:15,000
What about satellites, you might ask?

56
0:03:17.028,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Well, satellites are fantastic,

57
0:03:18.955,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and they have taught us so much about the big picture

58
0:03:21.482,000 --> 0:03:23,000
over the past few decades.

59
0:03:23.527,000 --> 0:03:25,000
However, the problem with satellites

60
0:03:25.927,000 --> 0:03:29,000
is they can only see through one micron of the surface of the ocean.

61
0:03:31.124,000 --> 0:03:34,000
They have relatively poor spatial and temporal resolution,

62
0:03:35.45,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and their signal needs to be corrected for cloud cover and land effects

63
0:03:39.748,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and other factors.

64
0:03:42.094,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So what is going on in the oceans?

65
0:03:45.929,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And what are we trying to measure?

66
0:03:48.283,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And how could a robot be of any use?

67
0:03:51.361,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Let's zoom in on a small cube in the ocean.

68
0:03:55.283,000 --> 0:03:58,000
One of the key things we want to understand is the surface,

69
0:03:58.615,000 --> 0:04:,000
because the surface, if you think about it,

70
0:04:00.678,000 --> 0:04:03,000
is the nexus of all air-sea interaction.

71
0:04:04.001,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It is the interface through which all energy and gases must flow.

72
0:04:09.552,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Our sun radiates energy,

73
0:04:11.676,000 --> 0:04:13,000
which is absorbed by oceans as heat

74
0:04:14.596,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and then partially released into the atmosphere.

75
0:04:17.476,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Gases in our atmosphere like CO2 get dissolved into our oceans.

76
0:04:22.099,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Actually, about 30 percent of all global CO2 gets absorbed.

77
0:04:26.603,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Plankton and microorganisms release oxygen into the atmosphere,

78
0:04:30.235,000 --> 0:04:34,000
so much so that every other breath you take comes from the ocean.

79
0:04:34.43,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Some of that heat generates evaporation, which creates clouds

80
0:04:37.486,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and then eventually leads to precipitation.

81
0:04:39.804,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And pressure gradients create surface wind,

82
0:04:42.081,000 --> 0:04:44,000
which moves the moisture through the atmosphere.

83
0:04:45.731,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Some of the heat radiates down into the deep ocean

84
0:04:49.588,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and gets stored in different layers,

85
0:04:51.74,000 --> 0:04:54,000
the ocean acting as some kind of planetary-scale boiler

86
0:04:55.069,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to store all that energy,

87
0:04:56.714,000 --> 0:04:59,000
which later might be released in short-term events like hurricanes

88
0:05:00.475,000 --> 0:05:02,000
or long-term phenomena like El Niño.

89
0:05:03.329,000 --> 0:05:07,000
These layers can get mixed up by vertical upwelling currents

90
0:05:07.668,000 --> 0:05:1,000
or horizontal currents, which are key in transporting heat

91
0:05:11.138,000 --> 0:05:12,000
from the tropics to the poles.

92
0:05:13.623,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And of course, there is marine life,

93
0:05:16.446,000 --> 0:05:21,000
occupying the largest ecosystem in volume on the planet,

94
0:05:21.486,000 --> 0:05:24,000
from microorganisms to fish to marine mammals,

95
0:05:25.212,000 --> 0:05:28,000
like seals, dolphins and whales.

96
0:05:28.244,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But all of these are mostly invisible to us.

97
0:05:33.821,000 --> 0:05:38,000
The challenge in studying those ocean variables at scale

98
0:05:39.221,000 --> 0:05:41,000
is one of energy,

99
0:05:41.419,000 --> 0:05:45,000
the energy that it takes to deploy sensors into the deep ocean.

100
0:05:46.597,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And of course, many solutions have been tried --

101
0:05:48.914,000 --> 0:05:49,000
from wave-actuated devices

102
0:05:50.549,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to surface drifters

103
0:05:52.114,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to sun-powered electrical drives --

104
0:05:54.86,000 --> 0:05:56,000
each with their own compromises.

105
0:05:57.745,000 --> 0:06:,000
Our team breakthrough came from an unlikely source --

106
0:06:00.939,000 --> 0:06:04,000
the pursuit of the world speed record in a wind-powered land yacht.

107
0:06:05.742,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It took 10 years of research and development

108
0:06:08.067,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to come up with a novel wing concept

109
0:06:10.62,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that only uses three watts of power to control

110
0:06:14.452,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and yet can propel a vehicle all around the globe

111
0:06:17.564,000 --> 0:06:19,000
with seemingly unlimited autonomy.

112
0:06:20.262,000 --> 0:06:23,000
By adapting this wing concept into a marine vehicle,

113
0:06:24.356,000 --> 0:06:26,000
we had the genesis of an ocean drone.

114
0:06:27.28,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Now, these are larger than they appear.

115
0:06:29.638,000 --> 0:06:33,000
They are about 15 feet high, 23 feet long, seven feet deep.

116
0:06:34.238,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Think of them as surface satellites.

117
0:06:36.315,000 --> 0:06:39,000
They're laden with an array of science-grade sensors

118
0:06:39.477,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that measure all key variables,

119
0:06:41.309,000 --> 0:06:43,000
both oceanographic and atmospheric,

120
0:06:44.331,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and a live satellite link transmits this high-resolution data

121
0:06:48.712,000 --> 0:06:5,000
back to shore in real time.

122
0:06:51.515,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Our team has been hard at work over the past few years,

123
0:06:54.417,000 --> 0:06:57,000
conducting missions in some of the toughest ocean conditions

124
0:06:57.949,000 --> 0:06:58,000
on the planet,

125
0:06:59.197,000 --> 0:07:01,000
from the Arctic to the tropical Pacific.

126
0:07:01.686,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We have sailed all the way to the polar ice shelf.

127
0:07:04.434,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We have sailed into Atlantic hurricanes.

128
0:07:07.159,000 --> 0:07:08,000
We have rounded Cape Horn,

129
0:07:09.141,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and we have slalomed between the oil rigs of the Gulf of Mexico.

130
0:07:12.404,000 --> 0:07:14,000
This is one tough robot.

131
0:07:15.629,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Let me share with you recent work that we did

132
0:07:18.634,000 --> 0:07:19,000
around the Pribilof Islands.

133
0:07:20.532,000 --> 0:07:23,000
This is a small group of islands deep in the cold Bering Sea

134
0:07:24.475,000 --> 0:07:26,000
between the US and Russia.

135
0:07:26.661,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Now, the Bering Sea is the home of the walleye pollock,

136
0:07:30.135,000 --> 0:07:32,000
which is a whitefish you might not recognize,

137
0:07:32.734,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but you might likely have tasted if you enjoy fish sticks or surimi.

138
0:07:37.445,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Yes, surimi looks like crabmeat, but it's actually pollock.

139
0:07:41.908,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And the pollock fishery is the largest fishery in the nation,

140
0:07:44.942,000 --> 0:07:46,000
both in terms of value and volume --

141
0:07:47.511,000 --> 0:07:5,000
about 3.1 billion pounds of fish caught every year.

142
0:07:51.695,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So over the past few years, a fleet of ocean drones

143
0:07:54.418,000 --> 0:07:56,000
has been hard at work in the Bering Sea

144
0:07:56.668,000 --> 0:08:,000
with the goal to help assess the size of the pollock fish stock.

145
0:08:01.147,000 --> 0:08:04,000
This helps improve the quota system that's used to manage the fishery

146
0:08:04.942,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and help prevent a collapse of the fish stock

147
0:08:07.134,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and protects this fragile ecosystem.

148
0:08:10.538,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Now, the drones survey the fishing ground using acoustics,

149
0:08:15.371,000 --> 0:08:16,000
i.e., a sonar.

150
0:08:16.919,000 --> 0:08:19,000
This sends a sound wave downwards,

151
0:08:20.164,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and then the reflection, the echo from the sound wave

152
0:08:22.698,000 --> 0:08:23,000
from the seabed or schools of fish,

153
0:08:24.48,000 --> 0:08:26,000
gives us an idea of what's happening below the surface.

154
0:08:27.849,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Our ocean drones are actually pretty good at this repetitive task,

155
0:08:31.879,000 --> 0:08:34,000
so they have been gridding the Bering Sea day in, day out.

156
0:08:35.808,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Now, the Pribilof Islands are also the home of a large colony of fur seals.

157
0:08:43.175,000 --> 0:08:47,000
In the 1950s, there were about two million individuals in that colony.

158
0:08:48.374,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Sadly, these days, the population has rapidly declined.

159
0:08:52.158,000 --> 0:08:54,000
There's less than 50 percent of that number left,

160
0:08:54.525,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and the population continues to fall rapidly.

161
0:08:57.904,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So to understand why,

162
0:09:00.031,000 --> 0:09:03,000
our science partner at the National Marine Mammal Laboratory

163
0:09:03.544,000 --> 0:09:06,000
has fitted a GPS tag on some of the mother seals,

164
0:09:06.905,000 --> 0:09:07,000
glued to their furs.

165
0:09:08.406,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And this tag measures location and depth

166
0:09:11.431,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and also has a really cool little camera

167
0:09:13.787,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that's triggered by sudden acceleration.

168
0:09:16.207,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Here is a movie taken by an artistically inclined seal,

169
0:09:20.145,000 --> 0:09:23,000
giving us unprecedented insight into an underwater hunt

170
0:09:23.91,000 --> 0:09:24,000
deep in the Arctic,

171
0:09:25.748,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and the shot of this pollock prey

172
0:09:28.144,000 --> 0:09:3,000
just seconds before it gets devoured.

173
0:09:30.934,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Now, doing work in the Arctic is very tough, even for a robot.

174
0:09:34.744,000 --> 0:09:36,000
They had to survive a snowstorm in August

175
0:09:37.358,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and interferences from bystanders --

176
0:09:40.873,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that little spotted seal enjoying a ride.

177
0:09:44.155,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Laughter)

178
0:09:47.378,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Now, the seal tags have recorded over 200,000 dives over the season,

179
0:09:54.395,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and upon a closer look,

180
0:09:56.378,000 --> 0:10:,000
we get to see the individual seal tracks and the repetitive dives.

181
0:10:01.413,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We are on our way to decode what is really happening

182
0:10:04.294,000 --> 0:10:05,000
over that foraging ground,

183
0:10:05.997,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and it's quite beautiful.

184
0:10:08.362,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Once you superimpose the acoustic data collected by the drones,

185
0:10:11.789,000 --> 0:10:13,000
a picture starts to emerge.

186
0:10:13.937,000 --> 0:10:17,000
As the seals leave the islands and swim from left to right,

187
0:10:18.333,000 --> 0:10:22,000
they are observed to dive at a relatively shallow depth of about 20 meters,

188
0:10:22.77,000 --> 0:10:26,000
which the drone identifies is populated by small young pollock

189
0:10:26.883,000 --> 0:10:28,000
with low calorific content.

190
0:10:28.99,000 --> 0:10:32,000
The seals then swim much greater distance and start to dive deeper

191
0:10:33.138,000 --> 0:10:37,000
to a place where the drone identifies larger, more adult pollock,

192
0:10:37.834,000 --> 0:10:39,000
which are more nutritious as fish.

193
0:10:40.117,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Unfortunately, the calories expended by the mother seals

194
0:10:44.263,000 --> 0:10:46,000
to swim this extra distance

195
0:10:46.41,000 --> 0:10:5,000
don't leave them with enough energy to lactate their pups back on the island,

196
0:10:51.35,000 --> 0:10:53,000
leading to the population decline.

197
0:10:54.408,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Further, the drones identify that the water temperature around the island

198
0:10:59.779,000 --> 0:11:,000
has significantly warmed.

199
0:11:01.488,000 --> 0:11:05,000
It might be one of the driving forces that's pushing the pollock north,

200
0:11:05.812,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and to spread in search of colder regions.

201
0:11:08.765,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So the data analysis is ongoing,

202
0:11:10.574,000 --> 0:11:13,000
but already we can see that some of the pieces of the puzzle

203
0:11:13.977,000 --> 0:11:14,000
from the fur seal mystery

204
0:11:15.374,000 --> 0:11:16,000
are coming into focus.

205
0:11:18.69,000 --> 0:11:2,000
But if you look back at the big picture,

206
0:11:20.803,000 --> 0:11:21,000
we are mammals, too.

207
0:11:23.032,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And actually, the oceans provide up to 20 kilos of fish per human per year.

208
0:11:26.88,000 --> 0:11:29,000
As we deplete our fish stocks, what can we humans learn

209
0:11:30.033,000 --> 0:11:31,000
from the fur seal story?

210
0:11:32.719,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And beyond fish, the oceans affect all of us daily

211
0:11:35.616,000 --> 0:11:36,000
as they drive global weather systems,

212
0:11:37.514,000 --> 0:11:39,000
which affect things like global agricultural output

213
0:11:40.299,000 --> 0:11:43,000
or can lead to devastating destruction of lives and property

214
0:11:43.952,000 --> 0:11:46,000
through hurricanes, extreme heat and floods.

215
0:11:47.756,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Our oceans are pretty much unexplored and undersampled,

216
0:11:51.56,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and today, we still know more about other planets than our own.

217
0:11:56.021,000 --> 0:11:59,000
But if you divide this vast ocean in six-by-six-degree squares,

218
0:11:59.833,000 --> 0:12:01,000
each about 400 miles long,

219
0:12:03.539,000 --> 0:12:05,000
you'd get about 1,000 such squares.

220
0:12:05.717,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So little by little, working with our partners,

221
0:12:08.037,000 --> 0:12:12,000
we are deploying one ocean drone in each of those boxes,

222
0:12:12.159,000 --> 0:12:14,000
the hope being that achieving planetary coverage

223
0:12:14.605,000 --> 0:12:17,000
will give us better insights into those planetary systems

224
0:12:17.809,000 --> 0:12:18,000
that affect humanity.

225
0:12:19.603,000 --> 0:12:22,000
We have been using robots to study distant worlds in our solar system

226
0:12:23.239,000 --> 0:12:24,000
for a while now.

227
0:12:24.939,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Now it is time to quantify our own planet,

228
0:12:28.44,000 --> 0:12:31,000
because we cannot fix what we cannot measure,

229
0:12:32.303,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and we cannot prepare for what we don't know.

230
0:12:35.761,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Thank you.

231
0:12:36.945,000 --> 0:12:39,000
(Applause)

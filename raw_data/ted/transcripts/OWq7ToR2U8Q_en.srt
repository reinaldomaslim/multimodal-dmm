1
0:00:12.599,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Now, I've been making pictures for quite a long time,

2
0:00:15.246,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and normally speaking, a picture like this, for me,

3
0:00:17.638,000 --> 0:00:18,000
should be straightforward.

4
0:00:19.565,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm in southern Ethiopia. I'm with the Daasanach.

5
0:00:22.421,000 --> 0:00:25,000
There's a big family, there's a very beautiful tree,

6
0:00:25.532,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and I make these pictures with this very large,

7
0:00:28.11,000 --> 0:00:31,000
extremely cumbersome, very awkward technical plate film camera.

8
0:00:31.871,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Does anybody know 4x5 and 10x8 sheets of film,

9
0:00:35.331,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and you're setting it up, putting it on the tripod.

10
0:00:38.86,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I've got the family, spent the better part of a day talking with them.

11
0:00:42.715,000 --> 0:00:44,000
They sort of understand what I'm on about.

12
0:00:44.731,000 --> 0:00:46,000
They think I'm a bit crazy, but that's another story.

13
0:00:47.239,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And what's most important for me is the beauty and the aesthetic,

14
0:00:50.609,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and that's based on the light.

15
0:00:52.861,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So the light's setting on my left-hand side,

16
0:00:55.462,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and there's a balance in the communication with the Daasanach,

17
0:00:59.096,000 --> 0:01:,000
the family of 30, all ages.

18
0:01:00.64,000 --> 0:01:01,000
There's babies and there's grandparents,

19
0:01:02.577,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I'm getting them in the tree and waiting for the light to set,

20
0:01:05.543,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and it's going, going, and I've got one sheet of film left,

21
0:01:08.632,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and I think, I'm okay, I'm in control, I'm in control.

22
0:01:11.173,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I'm setting it up and I'm setting up, and the light's just about to go,

23
0:01:14.745,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and I want it to be golden, I want it to be beautiful.

24
0:01:17.426,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I want it to be hanging on the horizon so it lights these people,

25
0:01:20.472,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in all the potential glory that they could be presented.

26
0:01:23.102,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And it's about to go and it's about to go,

27
0:01:25.151,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and I put my sheet in the camera,

28
0:01:26.776,000 --> 0:01:26,000
it's all focused,

29
0:01:27.628,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and all of a sudden there's a massive "whack,"

30
0:01:29.913,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and I'm looking around, and in the top corner of the tree,

31
0:01:32.687,000 --> 0:01:34,000
one of the girls slaps the girl next to her,

32
0:01:34.766,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and the girl next to her pulls her hair, and all hell breaks loose,

33
0:01:38.556,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and I'm standing there going, "But the light, the light.

34
0:01:41.29,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Wait, I need the light. Stay still! Stay still!"

35
0:01:43.58,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And they start screaming,

36
0:01:44.78,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and then one of the men turns around and starts screaming, shouting,

37
0:01:47.964,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and the whole tree collapses, not the tree, but the people in the tree.

38
0:01:51.397,000 --> 0:01:54,000
They're all running around screaming, and they run back off into the village

39
0:01:55.017,000 --> 0:01:58,000
in this sort of cloud of smoke, and I'm left there standing behind my tripod.

40
0:01:58.799,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I've got my sheet, and the light's gone, and I can't make the picture.

41
0:02:02.146,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Where have they all gone? I had no idea.

42
0:02:04.17,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It took me a week, it took me a week to make the picture which you see here today,

43
0:02:08.032,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and I'll tell you why. (Applause)

44
0:02:11.071,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's very, very, very simple -- I spent a week going around the village,

45
0:02:14.734,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and I went to every single one: "Hello, can you meet at the tree?

46
0:02:17.803,000 --> 0:02:18,000
What's your story? Who are you?"

47
0:02:19.592,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And it all turned out to be about a boyfriend, for crying out loud.

48
0:02:22.837,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I mean, I have teenage kids. I should know.

49
0:02:24.92,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It was about a boyfriend. The girl on the top, she'd kissed the wrong boy,

50
0:02:28.593,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and they'd started having a fight.

51
0:02:30.231,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And there was a very, very beautiful lesson for me in that:

52
0:02:33.028,000 --> 0:02:35,000
If I was going to photograph these people

53
0:02:35.24,000 --> 0:02:37,000
in the dignified, respectful way that I had intended,

54
0:02:37.784,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and put them on a pedestal, I had to understand them.

55
0:02:40.297,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It wasn't just about turning up. It wasn't just about shaking a hand.

56
0:02:43.587,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It wasn't about just saying, "I'm Jimmy, I'm a photographer."

57
0:02:46.642,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I had to get to know every single one of them,

58
0:02:48.812,000 --> 0:02:51,000
right down to whose boyfriend is who and who is allowed to kiss who.

59
0:02:52.085,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So in the end, a week later,

60
0:02:53.971,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and I was absolutely exhausted,

61
0:02:55.472,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I mean on my knees going, "Please get back up in that tree.

62
0:02:58.243,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It's a picture I need to make."

63
0:02:59.766,000 --> 0:03:01,000
They all came back. I put them all back up in the tree.

64
0:03:02.455,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I made sure the girls were in the right position,

65
0:03:04.765,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and the ones that slapped, one was over there.

66
0:03:06.93,000 --> 0:03:08,000
They did look at each other. If you look at it later,

67
0:03:09.488,000 --> 0:03:11,000
they're staring at each other very angrily,

68
0:03:11.952,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and I've got the tree and everything,

69
0:03:13.943,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and then at the last minute, I go, "The goat, the goat!

70
0:03:16.598,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I need something for the eye to look at. I need a white goat in the middle."

71
0:03:20.307,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So I swapped all the goats around. I put the goats in.

72
0:03:22.896,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But even then I got it wrong, because if you can see on the left-hand side,

73
0:03:26.507,000 --> 0:03:29,000
another little boy storms off because I didn't choose his goat.

74
0:03:29.594,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So the moral being I have to learn to speak Goat as well as Daasanach.

75
0:03:32.948,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But anyway, the effort that goes into that picture

76
0:03:35.461,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and the story that I've just related to you,

77
0:03:37.555,000 --> 0:03:38,000
as you can imagine,

78
0:03:38.563,000 --> 0:03:4,000
there are hundreds of other bizarre, eccentric stories

79
0:03:41.099,000 --> 0:03:43,000
of hundreds of other people around the world.

80
0:03:43.241,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And this was about four years ago, and I set off on a journey,

81
0:03:46.723,000 --> 0:03:48,000
to be honest, a very indulgent journey.

82
0:03:48.744,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I'm a real romantic. I'm an idealist, perhaps in some ways naive.

83
0:03:53.959,000 --> 0:03:56,000
But I truly believe that there are people on the planet that are beautiful.

84
0:03:57.752,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It's very, very simple. It's not rocket science.

85
0:04:00.5,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I wanted to put these people on a pedestal.

86
0:04:02.512,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I wanted to put them on a pedestal like they'd never been seen before.

87
0:04:05.995,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So, I chose about 35 different groups,

88
0:04:10.022,000 --> 0:04:11,000
tribes, indigenous cultures.

89
0:04:11.901,000 --> 0:04:13,000
They were chosen purely because of their aesthetic,

90
0:04:14.517,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and I'll talk more about that later.

91
0:04:16.374,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I'm not an anthropologist, I have no technical study with the subject,

92
0:04:19.95,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but I do have a very, very, very deep passion,

93
0:04:22.852,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and I believe that I had to choose the most beautiful people on the planet

94
0:04:26.324,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in the most beautiful environment that they lived in,

95
0:04:28.91,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and put the two together and present them to you.

96
0:04:31.825,000 --> 0:04:32,000
About a year ago,

97
0:04:33.289,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I published the first pictures,

98
0:04:35.402,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and something extraordinarily exciting happened.

99
0:04:39.419,000 --> 0:04:4,000
The whole world came running,

100
0:04:40.973,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and it was a bizarre experience, because everybody, from everywhere:

101
0:04:44.298,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"Who are they? What are they? How many are they?

102
0:04:46.629,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Where did you find them? Are they real? You faked it.

103
0:04:49.189,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me." Millions of questions for which,

104
0:04:52.619,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to be honest, I don't have the answers.

105
0:04:54.743,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I really didn't have the answers,

106
0:04:56.423,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and I could sort of understand, okay, they're beautiful, that was my intention,

107
0:05:00.246,000 --> 0:05:02,000
but the questions that I was being fired at,

108
0:05:02.313,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I could not answer them.

109
0:05:04.356,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Until, it was quite amusing, about a year ago

110
0:05:07.189,000 --> 0:05:09,000
somebody said, "You've been invited to do a TED Talk."

111
0:05:09.84,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And I said, "Ted? Ted? Who's Ted? I haven't met Ted before."

112
0:05:13.464,000 --> 0:05:15,000
He said, "No, a TED Talk." I said, "But who's Ted?

113
0:05:16.021,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Do I have to talk to him or do we sit with each other on the stage?"

114
0:05:19.343,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And, "No, no, the TED group. You must know about it."

115
0:05:22.48,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And I said, "I've been in a teepee and in a yurt for the last five years.

116
0:05:26.095,000 --> 0:05:28,000
How do I know who Ted is? Introduce me to him."

117
0:05:28.428,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Anyway, to cut a long story short, he said, "We have to do a TED Talk."

118
0:05:31.767,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Researched. Oh, exciting. That's great!

119
0:05:33.666,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And then eventually you're going to go to TEDGlobal.

120
0:05:36.14,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Even more exciting.

121
0:05:37.274,000 --> 0:05:4,000
But what you need to do, you need to teach the people lessons,

122
0:05:40.298,000 --> 0:05:43,000
lessons that you've learned on your travels around the world

123
0:05:43.35,000 --> 0:05:43,000
with these tribes.

124
0:05:44.28,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I thought, lessons, okay, well, what did I learn? Good question.

125
0:05:47.58,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Three. You need three lessons, and they need to be terribly profound.

126
0:05:50.886,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Laughter)

127
0:05:52.804,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And I thought, three lessons, well, I'm going to think about it.

128
0:05:55.947,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Applause)

129
0:06:01.193,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So I thought long and hard, and I stood here two days ago,

130
0:06:04.54,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and I had my test run, and I had my cards

131
0:06:06.505,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and my clicker in my hands and my pictures were on the screen,

132
0:06:09.449,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and I had my three lessons, and I started presenting them,

133
0:06:12.169,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and I had this very odd out-of-body experience.

134
0:06:14.563,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I sort of looked at myself standing there, going, "Oh, Jimmy,

135
0:06:17.417,000 --> 0:06:18,000
this is complete loads of codswallop.

136
0:06:19.233,000 --> 0:06:22,000
All these people sitting here, they've had more of these talks,

137
0:06:22.417,000 --> 0:06:24,000
they've heard more lessons in their life.

138
0:06:24.421,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Who are you to tell them what you've learned?

139
0:06:26.573,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Who are you to guide them and who are you to show them

140
0:06:29.216,000 --> 0:06:31,000
what is right, what is wrong, what these people have to say?"

141
0:06:32.171,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And I had a little bit of a, it was very private,

142
0:06:34.452,000 --> 0:06:35,000
a little bit of a meltdown.

143
0:06:35.77,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I went back, and a little bit like the boy walking away from the tree with his goats,

144
0:06:39.907,000 --> 0:06:42,000
very disgruntled, going, that didn't work,

145
0:06:43.158,000 --> 0:06:45,000
It wasn't what I wanted to communicate.

146
0:06:45.433,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And I thought long and hard about it, and I thought, well, the only thing

147
0:06:49.035,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I can communicate is very, very basic.

148
0:06:50.888,000 --> 0:06:51,000
You have to turn it all the way around.

149
0:06:52.775,000 --> 0:06:55,000
There's only one person I know here, and that's me.

150
0:06:56.153,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I'm still getting to know myself,

151
0:06:57.895,000 --> 0:07:,000
and it's a lifelong journey, and I probably won't have all the answers,

152
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but I did learn some extraordinary things on this journey.

153
0:07:05.44,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So what I'm going to do is share with you my lessons.

154
0:07:08.597,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It's a very, as I explained at the beginning, very indulgent, very personal,

155
0:07:12.323,000 --> 0:07:14,000
how and why I made these pictures,

156
0:07:14.654,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and I leave it to you as the audience to interpret what these lessons

157
0:07:17.889,000 --> 0:07:2,000
have meant to me, what they could perhaps mean to you.

158
0:07:22.377,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I traveled enormously as a child.

159
0:07:25.092,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I was very nomadic. It was actually very exciting.

160
0:07:27.613,000 --> 0:07:28,000
All around the world,

161
0:07:29.424,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and I had this feeling that I was pushed off at great speed

162
0:07:33.3,000 --> 0:07:35,000
to become somebody, become that individual, Jimmy.

163
0:07:35.763,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Go off into the planet, and so I ran, and I ran,

164
0:07:38.161,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and my wife sometimes kids me, "Jimmy, you look a bit like Forrest Gump,"

165
0:07:41.671,000 --> 0:07:43,000
but I'm, "No, it's all about something, trust me."

166
0:07:44.008,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So I kept running and I kept running, and I sort of got somewhere

167
0:07:47.171,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and I sort of stood there and looked around me and I thought, well,

168
0:07:50.342,000 --> 0:07:51,000
where do I belong? Where do I fit?

169
0:07:52.201,000 --> 0:07:55,000
What am I? Where am I from? I had no idea.

170
0:07:55.513,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So I hope there aren't too many psychologists in this audience.

171
0:07:58.59,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Perhaps part of this journey

172
0:07:59.98,000 --> 0:08:02,000
is about me trying to find out where I belonged.

173
0:08:03.103,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So whilst going, and don't worry, I didn't when I arrived with these tribes,

174
0:08:07.2,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I didn't paint myself yellow and run around with these spears and loincloths.

175
0:08:10.974,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But what I did find were people that belonged themselves,

176
0:08:13.9,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and they inspired me, some extraordinary people,

177
0:08:16.57,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and I'd like to introduce you to some heroes of mine.

178
0:08:19.38,000 --> 0:08:2,000
They're the Huli.

179
0:08:21.272,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Now, the Huli are some of the most extraordinarily beautiful people

180
0:08:25.382,000 --> 0:08:26,000
on the planet.

181
0:08:26.659,000 --> 0:08:29,000
They're proud. They live in the Papua New Guinean highlands.

182
0:08:30.631,000 --> 0:08:33,000
There's not many of them left, and they're called the Huli wigmen.

183
0:08:33.73,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And images like this, I mean, this is what it's all about for me.

184
0:08:36.808,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And you've spent weeks and months there talking with them, getting there,

185
0:08:40.298,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and I want to put them on a pedestal, and I said, "You have something

186
0:08:43.547,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that many people have not seen.

187
0:08:45.08,000 --> 0:08:46,000
You sit in this stunning nature."

188
0:08:46.735,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And it really does look like this, and they really do look like this.

189
0:08:50.016,000 --> 0:08:51,000
This is the real thing.

190
0:08:51.217,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And you know why they're proud? You know why they look like this,

191
0:08:54.271,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and why I broke my back literally

192
0:08:56.064,000 --> 0:08:58,000
to photograph them and present them to you?

193
0:08:58.238,000 --> 0:09:,000
It's because they have these extraordinary rituals.

194
0:09:00.74,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And the Huli have this ritual: When they're teenagers,

195
0:09:03.263,000 --> 0:09:05,000
becoming a man, they have to shave their heads,

196
0:09:06.14,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and they spend the rest of their life shaving their heads every single day,

197
0:09:10.262,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and what they do with that hair,

198
0:09:12.226,000 --> 0:09:13,000
they make it into a creation,

199
0:09:14.13,000 --> 0:09:15,000
a creation that's a very personal creation.

200
0:09:16.126,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It's their creation. It's their Huli creation.

201
0:09:18.379,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So they're called the Huli wigmen.

202
0:09:20.422,000 --> 0:09:21,000
That's a wig on his head.

203
0:09:22.279,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It's all made out of his human hair.

204
0:09:24.035,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And then they decorate that wig with the feathers of the birds of paradise,

205
0:09:27.573,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and don't worry, there are many birds there.

206
0:09:29.821,000 --> 0:09:32,000
There's very few people living, so nothing to get too upset about,

207
0:09:33.033,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and they spend the rest of their life recreating these hats

208
0:09:35.94,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and getting further and further,

209
0:09:37.494,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and it's extraordinary, and there's another group,

210
0:09:39.898,000 --> 0:09:42,000
they're called the Kalam, and they live in the next valley,

211
0:09:42.93,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but they speak a completely different language,

212
0:09:45.148,000 --> 0:09:47,000
they look completely different, and they wear a hat,

213
0:09:47.62,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and it's built out of scarabs,

214
0:09:49.217,000 --> 0:09:51,000
these fantastic emerald green little scarabs,

215
0:09:51.53,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and sometimes there are 5,000 or 6,000 scarabs in this hat,

216
0:09:54.637,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and they spend the whole of their life collecting these scarabs

217
0:09:57.68,000 --> 0:09:58,000
to build these hats.

218
0:09:58.698,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So the Huli inspired me in that they belong.

219
0:10:02.622,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Perhaps I have to work harder at finding a ritual which matters for me

220
0:10:06.198,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and going back into my past to see where I actually fit.

221
0:10:10.679,000 --> 0:10:12,000
An extremely important part of this project

222
0:10:13.349,000 --> 0:10:18,000
was about how I photograph these extraordinary people.

223
0:10:19.27,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And it's basically beauty. I think beauty matters.

224
0:10:22.66,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We spend the whole of our existence revolving around beauty:

225
0:10:26.12,000 --> 0:10:29,000
beautiful places, beautiful things, and ultimately, beautiful people.

226
0:10:29.788,000 --> 0:10:31,000
It's very, very, very significant.

227
0:10:31.808,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I've spent all of my life analyzing what do I look like?

228
0:10:34.595,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Am I perceived as beautiful?

229
0:10:36.332,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Does it matter if I'm a beautiful person or not,

230
0:10:38.705,000 --> 0:10:39,000
or is it purely based on my aesthetic?

231
0:10:40.678,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And then when I went off, I came to a very narrow conclusion.

232
0:10:43.604,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Do I have to go around the world photographing, excuse me,

233
0:10:47.156,000 --> 0:10:5,000
women between the age of 25 and 30? Is that what beauty is going to be?

234
0:10:50.954,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Is everything before and after that utterly irrelevant?

235
0:10:54.409,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And it was only until I went on a journey,

236
0:10:56.653,000 --> 0:10:58,000
a journey that was so extreme,

237
0:10:59.44,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I still get shivers when I think about it.

238
0:11:02.048,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I went to a part of the world, and I don't know whether any of you

239
0:11:05.197,000 --> 0:11:08,000
have ever heard of Chukotka. Has anybody ever heard of Chukotka?

240
0:11:08.402,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Chukotka probably is, technically, as far as one can go

241
0:11:12.929,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and still be on the living planet.

242
0:11:16.691,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It's 13 hours' flight from Moscow.

243
0:11:18.757,000 --> 0:11:21,000
First you've got to get to Moscow, and then 13 hours' flight nonstop from Moscow.

244
0:11:22.605,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And that's if you get there.

245
0:11:25.326,000 --> 0:11:27,000
As you can see, some people sort of miss the runway.

246
0:11:27.851,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And then when you land there, in Chukotka are the Chukchis.

247
0:11:30.86,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Now, the Chukchis are the last indigenous Inuits of Siberia,

248
0:11:34.151,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and they're people I'd heard about, I'd hardly seen any images of,

249
0:11:37.344,000 --> 0:11:38,000
but I knew they were there,

250
0:11:38.74,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and I'd been in touch with this guide,

251
0:11:40.734,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and this guide said,

252
0:11:41.773,000 --> 0:11:44,000
"There's this fantastic tribe. There's only about 40 of them.

253
0:11:44.81,000 --> 0:11:47,000
You'll be okay. We'll find them." So off we went on this journey.

254
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:51,000
When we arrived there, after a month of traveling across the ice,

255
0:11:51.062,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and we'd got to them, but then I was not allowed to photograph them.

256
0:11:54.386,000 --> 0:11:56,000
They said, "You cannot photograph us. You have to wait.

257
0:11:56.955,000 --> 0:12:,000
You have to wait until you get to know us. You have to wait until you understand us.

258
0:12:01.138,000 --> 0:12:04,000
You have to wait until you see how we interact with one another."

259
0:12:04.264,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And only then, it was many, many weeks later, I saw a respect.

260
0:12:07.202,000 --> 0:12:08,000
They had zero judgment.

261
0:12:08.736,000 --> 0:12:11,000
They observed one another, from the youth, from the middle aged to the old.

262
0:12:12.334,000 --> 0:12:14,000
They need each other.

263
0:12:14.6,000 --> 0:12:16,000
The children need to chew the meat all day

264
0:12:16.63,000 --> 0:12:18,000
because the adults don't have any teeth,

265
0:12:18.779,000 --> 0:12:2,000
but at the same time, the children take the old aged people out

266
0:12:21.737,000 --> 0:12:22,000
to the toilet because they're infirm,

267
0:12:23.707,000 --> 0:12:25,000
so there's this fantastic community of respect.

268
0:12:25.992,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And they adore and admire one another, and they truly taught me

269
0:12:29.75,000 --> 0:12:3,000
what beauty was.

270
0:12:31.513,000 --> 0:12:33,000
(Applause)

271
0:12:34.113,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Now I'm going to ask for a little bit of audience interaction.

272
0:12:37.061,000 --> 0:12:39,000
This is extremely important for the end of my talk.

273
0:12:39.618,000 --> 0:12:41,000
If you could look at somebody left to the right of you,

274
0:12:42.249,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and I want you to observe them,

275
0:12:44.233,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and I want you to give them a compliment. This is very important.

276
0:12:47.411,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Now, it may be their nose or their hair or even their aura, I don't mind,

277
0:12:51.434,000 --> 0:12:54,000
but please look at each other, give them a compliment.

278
0:12:54.477,000 --> 0:12:56,000
You have to be quick, because I'm running out of time.

279
0:12:57.17,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And you have to remember it.

280
0:13:01.768,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you, you've given each other compliments.

281
0:13:05.97,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Hold that compliment very, very tightly. Hold it for later.

282
0:13:09.546,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And the last thing, it was extraordinarily profound,

283
0:13:13.98,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and it happened only two weeks ago. Two weeks ago I went back to the Himba.

284
0:13:17.659,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Now, the Himba live in northern Namibia on the border of Angola,

285
0:13:20.763,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and I'd been there a few times before,

286
0:13:22.69,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and I'd gone back to present this book I'd made,

287
0:13:25.039,000 --> 0:13:27,000
to show them the pictures, to get into a discussion with them,

288
0:13:27.96,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to say, "This is how I saw you. This is how I love you.

289
0:13:30.83,000 --> 0:13:33,000
This is how I respect you. What do you think? Am I right? Am I wrong?"

290
0:13:34.143,000 --> 0:13:37,000
So I wanted this debate. It was very, very, very emotional,

291
0:13:37.216,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and one night we were sitting around the campfire,

292
0:13:39.657,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and I have to be honest, I think I'd had a little bit too much to drink,

293
0:13:43.279,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and I was sort of sitting under the stars going, "This is great,

294
0:13:46.826,000 --> 0:13:48,000
you've seen my pictures, we love each other." (Laughter)

295
0:13:49.45,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And I'm a little bit slow,

296
0:13:52.592,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and I looked around me, and I said,

297
0:13:54.503,000 --> 0:13:56,000
I thought, maybe, the fence is missing.

298
0:13:56.805,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Wasn't there a fence here last time I came?

299
0:13:58.9,000 --> 0:14:01,000
You know, this big protective fence around the village,

300
0:14:01.958,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and they sort of looked at me and go, "Yeah, chief die."

301
0:14:04.672,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And I thought, okay, chief dying, right, you know,

302
0:14:07.138,000 --> 0:14:09,000
look up at the stars again, look at the campfire.

303
0:14:09.529,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Chief die. What on Earth does chief die have to do with the fence?

304
0:14:13.399,000 --> 0:14:16,000
"Chief die.

305
0:14:16.416,000 --> 0:14:18,000
First we destroy, yeah? Then we reflect.

306
0:14:18.854,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Then we rebuild. Then we respect."

307
0:14:22.708,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And I burst out in tears, because my father had only just died

308
0:14:26.656,000 --> 0:14:27,000
prior to this journey,

309
0:14:28.49,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and I didn't ever acknowledge him,

310
0:14:30.161,000 --> 0:14:33,000
I didn't ever appreciate him for the fact that I'm probably standing here today

311
0:14:34.12,000 --> 0:14:36,000
because of him.

312
0:14:36.233,000 --> 0:14:41,000
These people taught me that we are only who we are because of our parents

313
0:14:41.259,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and our grandparents and our forefathers

314
0:14:43.535,000 --> 0:14:44,000
going on and on and on before that,

315
0:14:45.346,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and I, no matter how romantic or how idealistic I am on this journey,

316
0:14:49.432,000 --> 0:14:51,000
I did not know that until two weeks ago.

317
0:14:51.789,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I did not know that until two weeks ago.

318
0:14:54.738,000 --> 0:14:56,000
So what's this all about?

319
0:14:57.519,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Well, there's an image I'd like to show you,

320
0:14:59.776,000 --> 0:15:02,000
quite a special image, and it wasn't essentially the image I wanted to choose.

321
0:15:03.505,000 --> 0:15:06,000
I was sitting there the other day, and I have to finish on a strong image.

322
0:15:07.303,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And somebody said, "You have to show them the picture of the Nenets. The Nenets."

323
0:15:11.162,000 --> 0:15:13,000
I was like, yeah, but that's not my favorite picture.

324
0:15:13.83,000 --> 0:15:15,000
She went, "No no no no no no no. It's an amazing picture.

325
0:15:16.528,000 --> 0:15:17,000
You're in his eyes."

326
0:15:17.581,000 --> 0:15:2,000
I said, "What do you mean I'm in his eyes? It's a picture of the Nenets."

327
0:15:21.12,000 --> 0:15:23,000
She said, "No, look, look closely, you're in his eyes."

328
0:15:23.709,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And when you look closely at this picture, there is a reflection of me in his eyes,

329
0:15:27.871,000 --> 0:15:3,000
so I think perhaps he has my soul, and I'm in his soul,

330
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and whilst these pictures look at you, I ask you to look at them.

331
0:15:34.438,000 --> 0:15:36,000
You may not be reflected in his eyes,

332
0:15:37.126,000 --> 0:15:4,000
but there is something extraordinarily important about these people.

333
0:15:40.502,000 --> 0:15:44,000
I don't ultimately have the answers, as I've just shared with you,

334
0:15:44.57,000 --> 0:15:46,000
but you must do. There must be something there.

335
0:15:46.818,000 --> 0:15:49,000
So if you can briefly reflect on what I was discussing

336
0:15:50.44,000 --> 0:15:55,000
about beauty and about belonging and about our ancestors and our roots,

337
0:15:55.641,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and I need you all to stand for me, please.

338
0:15:59.123,000 --> 0:16:,000
(Laughter)

339
0:16:01.068,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Now you have no excuse. It's almost lunchtime,

340
0:16:03.368,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and this is not a standing ovation, so don't worry,

341
0:16:05.902,000 --> 0:16:06,000
I'm not fishing for compliments.

342
0:16:07.784,000 --> 0:16:09,000
But you were given a compliment a few minutes ago.

343
0:16:10.384,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Now I want you to stand tall.

344
0:16:12.711,000 --> 0:16:14,000
I want you to breathe in. This is what I say.

345
0:16:14.895,000 --> 0:16:16,000
I'm not going to get on my knees for two weeks.

346
0:16:17.236,000 --> 0:16:19,000
I'm not going to ask you to carry a goat,

347
0:16:19.324,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and I know you don't have any camels.

348
0:16:21.345,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Photography's extraordinarily powerful.

349
0:16:23.219,000 --> 0:16:25,000
It's this language which we now all understand.

350
0:16:25.407,000 --> 0:16:26,000
We truly do all understand it,

351
0:16:27.264,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and we have this global digital fireplace, don't we,

352
0:16:29.749,000 --> 0:16:3,000
but I want to share you with the world,

353
0:16:31.72,000 --> 0:16:32,000
because you are also a tribe.

354
0:16:33.185,000 --> 0:16:36,000
You are the TED tribe, yeah? But you have to remember that compliment.

355
0:16:36.493,000 --> 0:16:39,000
You have to stand tall, breathe in through your nose,

356
0:16:39.734,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and I'm going to photograph you. Okay?

357
0:16:41.702,000 --> 0:16:43,000
I need to do a panoramic shot, so it's going to take a minute,

358
0:16:44.646,000 --> 0:16:45,000
so you have to concentrate, okay?

359
0:16:46.227,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Breathe in, stand tall, no laughing. Shh, breathe through your nose.

360
0:16:49.496,000 --> 0:16:5,000
I'm going to photograph.

361
0:16:50.95,000 --> 0:16:54,000
(Clicks)

362
0:16:59.307,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Thank you.

363
0:17:01.536,000 --> 0:17:05,000
(Applause)

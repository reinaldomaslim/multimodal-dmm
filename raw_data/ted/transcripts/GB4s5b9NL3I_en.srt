1
0:00:13.2,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Democracy.

2
0:00:14.96,000 --> 0:00:15,000
In the West,

3
0:00:16.32,000 --> 0:00:19,000
we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted.

4
0:00:20.28,000 --> 0:00:21,000
We see democracy

5
0:00:21.6,000 --> 0:00:25,000
not as the most fragile of flowers that it really is,

6
0:00:26.12,000 --> 0:00:28,000
but we see it as part of our society's furniture.

7
0:00:29.96,000 --> 0:00:33,000
We tend to think of it as an intransigent given.

8
0:00:34.68,000 --> 0:00:39,000
We mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy.

9
0:00:39.92,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It doesn't.

10
0:00:41.28,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing

11
0:00:45.68,000 --> 0:00:47,000
have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt

12
0:00:48.64,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism,

13
0:00:52.56,000 --> 0:00:53,000
spectacular growth,

14
0:00:54.96,000 --> 0:00:57,000
while politics remains democracy-free.

15
0:00:58.04,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Indeed, democracy is receding in our neck of the woods,

16
0:01:02.48,000 --> 0:01:03,000
here in Europe.

17
0:01:04.08,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Earlier this year, while I was representing Greece --

18
0:01:07.48,000 --> 0:01:09,000
the newly elected Greek government --

19
0:01:10.24,000 --> 0:01:12,000
in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister,

20
0:01:12.96,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I was told in no uncertain terms that our nation's democratic process --

21
0:01:17.92,000 --> 0:01:18,000
our elections --

22
0:01:19.36,000 --> 0:01:2,000
could not be allowed to interfere

23
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
with economic policies that were being implemented in Greece.

24
0:01:25.12,000 --> 0:01:26,000
At that moment,

25
0:01:26.36,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I felt that there could be no greater vindication of Lee Kuan Yew,

26
0:01:30.68,000 --> 0:01:31,000
or the Chinese Communist Party,

27
0:01:32.24,000 --> 0:01:35,000
indeed of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me

28
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything.

29
0:01:41.64,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Tonight, here, I want to present to you

30
0:01:44.92,000 --> 0:01:47,000
an economic case for an authentic democracy.

31
0:01:48.6,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I want to ask you to join me in believing again

32
0:01:53.48,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that Lee Kuan Yew,

33
0:01:56.48,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the Chinese Communist Party

34
0:01:57.88,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and indeed the Eurogroup

35
0:01:59.28,000 --> 0:02:02,000
are wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy --

36
0:02:03.6,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that we need an authentic, boisterous democracy.

37
0:02:07.36,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And without democracy,

38
0:02:10.36,000 --> 0:02:12,000
our societies will be nastier,

39
0:02:13.24,000 --> 0:02:15,000
our future bleak

40
0:02:15.4,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and our great, new technologies wasted.

41
0:02:18.24,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Speaking of waste,

42
0:02:19.52,000 --> 0:02:21,000
allow me to point out an interesting paradox

43
0:02:22.32,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that is threatening our economies as we speak.

44
0:02:25.12,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I call it the twin peaks paradox.

45
0:02:27.44,000 --> 0:02:28,000
One peak you understand --

46
0:02:28.76,000 --> 0:02:29,000
you know it, you recognize it --

47
0:02:30.4,000 --> 0:02:35,000
is the mountain of debts that has been casting a long shadow

48
0:02:35.48,000 --> 0:02:37,000
over the United States, Europe, the whole world.

49
0:02:38.32,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We all recognize the mountain of debts.

50
0:02:40.88,000 --> 0:02:44,000
But few people discern its twin.

51
0:02:45.64,000 --> 0:02:47,000
A mountain of idle cash

52
0:02:48.84,000 --> 0:02:51,000
belonging to rich savers and to corporations,

53
0:02:53.12,000 --> 0:02:55,000
too terrified to invest it

54
0:02:55.72,000 --> 0:02:58,000
into the productive activities that can generate the incomes

55
0:02:59.04,000 --> 0:03:02,000
from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts

56
0:03:02.12,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs,

57
0:03:06.12,000 --> 0:03:07,000
like green energy.

58
0:03:07.8,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Now let me give you two numbers.

59
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Over the last three months,

60
0:03:11.52,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in the United States, in Britain and in the Eurozone,

61
0:03:14.32,000 --> 0:03:18,000
we have invested, collectively, 3.4 trillion dollars

62
0:03:18.76,000 --> 0:03:2,000
on all the wealth-producing goods --

63
0:03:21.44,000 --> 0:03:24,000
things like industrial plants, machinery,

64
0:03:24.48,000 --> 0:03:26,000
office blocks, schools,

65
0:03:26.72,000 --> 0:03:29,000
roads, railways, machinery, and so on and so forth.

66
0:03:29.88,000 --> 0:03:31,000
$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money

67
0:03:32.64,000 --> 0:03:35,000
until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion

68
0:03:36.52,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that has been slushing around in the same countries,

69
0:03:39.24,000 --> 0:03:4,000
in our financial institutions,

70
0:03:41.08,000 --> 0:03:44,000
doing absolutely nothing during the same period

71
0:03:45.44,000 --> 0:03:49,000
except inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices.

72
0:03:50.32,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash

73
0:03:55.6,000 --> 0:03:58,000
form twin peaks, failing to cancel each other out

74
0:03:59.32,000 --> 0:04:01,000
through the normal operation of the markets.

75
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The result is stagnant wages,

76
0:04:05.36,000 --> 0:04:1,000
more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds in America, in Japan and in Europe

77
0:04:11.04,000 --> 0:04:12,000
out of work.

78
0:04:12.56,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And consequently, low aggregate demand,

79
0:04:14.92,000 --> 0:04:16,000
which in a never-ending cycle,

80
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
reinforces the pessimism of the investors,

81
0:04:20.88,000 --> 0:04:23,000
who, fearing low demand, reproduce it by not investing --

82
0:04:24.72,000 --> 0:04:26,000
exactly like Oedipus' father,

83
0:04:27.44,000 --> 0:04:29,000
who, terrified by the prophecy of the oracle

84
0:04:29.959,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that his son would grow up to kill him,

85
0:04:32.72,000 --> 0:04:33,000
unwittingly engineered the conditions

86
0:04:34.68,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that ensured that Oedipus, his son, would kill him.

87
0:04:38.56,000 --> 0:04:4,000
This is my quarrel with capitalism.

88
0:04:41.2,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Its gross wastefulness,

89
0:04:43.24,000 --> 0:04:44,000
all this idle cash,

90
0:04:44.88,000 --> 0:04:48,000
should be energized to improve lives,

91
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to develop human talents,

92
0:04:50.36,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and indeed to finance all these technologies,

93
0:04:53.24,000 --> 0:04:54,000
green technologies,

94
0:04:54.52,000 --> 0:04:56,000
which are absolutely essential for saving planet Earth.

95
0:04:58.28,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer?

96
0:05:01.56,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I believe so,

97
0:05:02.8,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but before we move on,

98
0:05:04.04,000 --> 0:05:05,000
what do we mean by democracy?

99
0:05:06.52,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Aristotle defined democracy

100
0:05:08.96,000 --> 0:05:12,000
as the constitution in which the free and the poor,

101
0:05:13.92,000 --> 0:05:15,000
being in the majority, control government.

102
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Now, of course Athenian democracy excluded too many.

103
0:05:20.32,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Women, migrants and, of course, the slaves.

104
0:05:24.04,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But it would be a mistake

105
0:05:25.32,000 --> 0:05:28,000
to dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy

106
0:05:28.92,000 --> 0:05:3,000
on the basis of whom it excluded.

107
0:05:31.68,000 --> 0:05:32,000
What was more pertinent,

108
0:05:32.96,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and continues to be so about ancient Athenian democracy,

109
0:05:36.84,000 --> 0:05:39,000
was the inclusion of the working poor,

110
0:05:40.36,000 --> 0:05:44,000
who not only acquired the right to free speech,

111
0:05:45.08,000 --> 0:05:47,000
but more importantly, crucially,

112
0:05:47.36,000 --> 0:05:49,000
they acquired the rights to political judgments

113
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that were afforded equal weight

114
0:05:52.4,000 --> 0:05:55,000
in the decision-making concerning matters of state.

115
0:05:56.08,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Now, of course, Athenian democracy didn't last long.

116
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Like a candle that burns brightly, it burned out quickly.

117
0:06:03.6,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And indeed,

118
0:06:04.84,000 --> 0:06:08,000
our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient Athens.

119
0:06:09.12,000 --> 0:06:11,000
They have their roots in the Magna Carta,

120
0:06:11.48,000 --> 0:06:14,000
in the 1688 Glorious Revolution,

121
0:06:14.76,000 --> 0:06:16,000
indeed in the American constitution.

122
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Whereas Athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen

123
0:06:22.04,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and empowering the working poor,

124
0:06:25.24,000 --> 0:06:29,000
our liberal democracies are founded on the Magna Carta tradition,

125
0:06:29.44,000 --> 0:06:32,000
which was, after all, a charter for masters.

126
0:06:32.56,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And indeed, liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible

127
0:06:36.88,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to separate fully the political sphere from the economic sphere,

128
0:06:40.76,000 --> 0:06:45,000
so as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere,

129
0:06:45.84,000 --> 0:06:46,000
leaving the economic sphere --

130
0:06:47.72,000 --> 0:06:48,000
the corporate world, if you want --

131
0:06:49.68,000 --> 0:06:51,000
as a democracy-free zone.

132
0:06:53.72,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Now, in our democracies today,

133
0:06:56.72,000 --> 0:06:59,000
this separation of the economic from the political sphere,

134
0:07:00.24,000 --> 0:07:02,000
the moment it started happening,

135
0:07:02.52,000 --> 0:07:06,000
it gave rise to an inexorable, epic struggle between the two,

136
0:07:06.84,000 --> 0:07:09,000
with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere,

137
0:07:10.08,000 --> 0:07:11,000
eating into its power.

138
0:07:12.48,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be?

139
0:07:16.56,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It's not because their DNA has degenerated.

140
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:2,000
(Laughter)

141
0:07:20.64,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power,

142
0:07:25.28,000 --> 0:07:28,000
because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere,

143
0:07:28.6,000 --> 0:07:29,000
which is separate.

144
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Indeed,

145
0:07:32.76,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I spoke about my quarrel with capitalism.

146
0:07:35.08,000 --> 0:07:36,000
If you think about it,

147
0:07:36.84,000 --> 0:07:39,000
it is a little bit like a population of predators,

148
0:07:41.08,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on,

149
0:07:46.56,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that in the end they starve.

150
0:07:48.72,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Similarly,

151
0:07:49.96,000 --> 0:07:52,000
the economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere

152
0:07:53.68,000 --> 0:07:56,000
to such an extent that it is undermining itself,

153
0:07:57.08,000 --> 0:07:58,000
causing economic crisis.

154
0:07:58.84,000 --> 0:08:,000
Corporate power is increasing,

155
0:08:00.96,000 --> 0:08:02,000
political goods are devaluing,

156
0:08:03.2,000 --> 0:08:04,000
inequality is rising,

157
0:08:05.04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
aggregate demand is falling

158
0:08:06.64,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and CEOs of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations.

159
0:08:13.52,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy,

160
0:08:20.2,000 --> 0:08:21,000
the taller the twin peaks

161
0:08:21.56,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and the greater the waste of human resources

162
0:08:25.12,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and humanity's wealth.

163
0:08:27.64,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Clearly, if this is right,

164
0:08:30.52,000 --> 0:08:33,000
we must reunite the political and economic spheres

165
0:08:33.6,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and better do it with a demos being in control,

166
0:08:37.12,000 --> 0:08:39,000
like in ancient Athens except without the slaves

167
0:08:40.08,000 --> 0:08:42,000
or the exclusion of women and migrants.

168
0:08:44.12,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Now, this is not an original idea.

169
0:08:45.88,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The Marxist left had that idea 100 years ago

170
0:08:48.679,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and it didn't go very well, did it?

171
0:08:50.84,000 --> 0:08:53,000
The lesson that we learned from the Soviet debacle

172
0:08:54.28,000 --> 0:09:,000
is that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered,

173
0:09:00.64,000 --> 0:09:01,000
as they were in ancient Athens,

174
0:09:02.64,000 --> 0:09:05,000
without creating new forms of brutality and waste.

175
0:09:06.96,000 --> 0:09:07,000
But there is a solution:

176
0:09:08.88,000 --> 0:09:09,000
eliminate the working poor.

177
0:09:11.36,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Capitalism's doing it

178
0:09:12.64,000 --> 0:09:16,000
by replacing low-wage workers with automata, androids, robots.

179
0:09:19.08,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The problem is

180
0:09:20.32,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate,

181
0:09:23.56,000 --> 0:09:27,000
automation makes the twin peaks taller,

182
0:09:28.64,000 --> 0:09:29,000
the waste loftier

183
0:09:30.4,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and the social conflicts deeper,

184
0:09:32.48,000 --> 0:09:33,000
including --

185
0:09:34.32,000 --> 0:09:35,000
soon, I believe --

186
0:09:35.88,000 --> 0:09:36,000
in places like China.

187
0:09:38.72,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So we need to reconfigure,

188
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres,

189
0:09:44.84,000 --> 0:09:49,000
but we'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere,

190
0:09:50.24,000 --> 0:09:55,000
lest we end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy

191
0:09:55.96,000 --> 0:09:59,000
that makes The Matrix, the movie, look like a documentary.

192
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Laughter)

193
0:10:01.6,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So the question is not whether capitalism will survive

194
0:10:05.04,000 --> 0:10:07,000
the technological innovations it is spawning.

195
0:10:07.96,000 --> 0:10:08,000
The more interesting question

196
0:10:09.6,000 --> 0:10:14,000
is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia

197
0:10:15.36,000 --> 0:10:19,000
or something much closer to a Star Trek-like society,

198
0:10:19.8,000 --> 0:10:21,000
where machines serve the humans

199
0:10:22.2,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe

200
0:10:26.64,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and indulging in long debates about the meaning of life

201
0:10:30.96,000 --> 0:10:34,000
in some ancient, Athenian-like, high tech agora.

202
0:10:36.36,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I think we can afford to be optimistic.

203
0:10:41.4,000 --> 0:10:42,000
But what would it take,

204
0:10:42.72,000 --> 0:10:43,000
what would it look like

205
0:10:44.72,000 --> 0:10:48,000
to have this Star Trek-like utopia, instead of the Matrix-like dystopia?

206
0:10:50.24,000 --> 0:10:51,000
In practical terms,

207
0:10:51.52,000 --> 0:10:52,000
allow me to share just briefly,

208
0:10:53.28,000 --> 0:10:54,000
a couple of examples.

209
0:10:55.08,000 --> 0:10:56,000
At the level of the enterprise,

210
0:10:56.88,000 --> 0:10:58,000
imagine a capital market,

211
0:10:59.24,000 --> 0:11:01,000
where you earn capital as you work,

212
0:11:02.88,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and where your capital follows you from one job to another,

213
0:11:08.24,000 --> 0:11:09,000
from one company to another,

214
0:11:09.76,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and the company --

215
0:11:11.04,000 --> 0:11:14,000
whichever one you happen to work at at that time --

216
0:11:14.52,000 --> 0:11:18,000
is solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment.

217
0:11:19.4,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Then all income stems from capital, from profits,

218
0:11:24.12,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete.

219
0:11:28.52,000 --> 0:11:34,000
No more separation between those who own but do not work in the company

220
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and those who work but do not own the company;

221
0:11:38.44,000 --> 0:11:41,000
no more tug-of-war between capital and labor;

222
0:11:42.44,000 --> 0:11:46,000
no great gap between investment and saving;

223
0:11:46.6,000 --> 0:11:49,000
indeed, no towering twin peaks.

224
0:11:50.6,000 --> 0:11:52,000
At the level of the global political economy,

225
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:54,000
imagine for a moment

226
0:11:54.96,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that our national currencies have a free-floating exchange rate,

227
0:11:59.96,000 --> 0:12:02,000
with a universal, global, digital currency,

228
0:12:03.76,000 --> 0:12:07,000
one that is issued by the International Monetary Fund,

229
0:12:07.8,000 --> 0:12:08,000
the G-20,

230
0:12:09.04,000 --> 0:12:11,000
on behalf of all humanity.

231
0:12:11.6,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And imagine further

232
0:12:12.84,000 --> 0:12:16,000
that all international trade is denominated in this currency --

233
0:12:17.2,000 --> 0:12:18,000
let's call it "the cosmos,"

234
0:12:19.04,000 --> 0:12:2,000
in units of cosmos --

235
0:12:21.72,000 --> 0:12:25,000
with every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund

236
0:12:26.12,000 --> 0:12:31,000
a sum of cosmos units proportional to the country's trade deficit,

237
0:12:31.68,000 --> 0:12:34,000
or indeed to a country's trade surplus.

238
0:12:35.72,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies,

239
0:12:40.96,000 --> 0:12:45,000
especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce.

240
0:12:46.84,000 --> 0:12:47,000
This is not a new idea.

241
0:12:48.44,000 --> 0:12:51,000
It's what, effectively, John Maynard Keynes proposed

242
0:12:51.8,000 --> 0:12:54,000
in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference.

243
0:12:56.08,000 --> 0:12:57,000
The problem is

244
0:12:57.32,000 --> 0:13:,000
that back then, they didn't have the technology to implement it.

245
0:13:00.64,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Now we do,

246
0:13:01.88,000 --> 0:13:06,000
especially in the context of a reunified political-economic sphere.

247
0:13:08.64,000 --> 0:13:1,000
The world that I am describing to you

248
0:13:11.08,000 --> 0:13:13,000
is simultaneously libertarian,

249
0:13:13.56,000 --> 0:13:17,000
in that it prioritizes empowered individuals,

250
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Marxist,

251
0:13:19.4,000 --> 0:13:22,000
since it will have confined to the dustbin of history

252
0:13:22.64,000 --> 0:13:24,000
the division between capital and labor,

253
0:13:25.12,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and Keynesian,

254
0:13:27.32,000 --> 0:13:28,000
global Keynesian.

255
0:13:30.32,000 --> 0:13:31,000
But above all else,

256
0:13:31.92,000 --> 0:13:35,000
it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy.

257
0:13:37.76,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Will such a world dawn?

258
0:13:40.4,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Or shall we descend into a Matrix-like dystopia?

259
0:13:44.92,000 --> 0:13:48,000
The answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively.

260
0:13:49.72,000 --> 0:13:5,000
It is our choice,

261
0:13:51.36,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and we'd better make it democratically.

262
0:13:54.28,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Thank you.

263
0:13:55.56,000 --> 0:13:58,000
(Applause)

264
0:14:01.48,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Bruno Giussani: Yanis ...

265
0:14:03.88,000 --> 0:14:07,000
It was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian Marxist.

266
0:14:10.4,000 --> 0:14:12,000
What is the relevance of Marx's analysis today?

267
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Yanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was any relevance in what I just said,

268
0:14:17.36,000 --> 0:14:18,000
then Marx is relevant.

269
0:14:18.6,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Because the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is --

270
0:14:22.12,000 --> 0:14:23,000
if we don't do it,

271
0:14:23.36,000 --> 0:14:25,000
then technological innovation is going to create

272
0:14:25.64,000 --> 0:14:27,000
such a massive fall in aggregate demand,

273
0:14:27.96,000 --> 0:14:31,000
what Larry Summers refers to as secular stagnation.

274
0:14:32.76,000 --> 0:14:34,000
With this crisis migrating from one part of the world,

275
0:14:35.64,000 --> 0:14:36,000
as it is now,

276
0:14:37.2,000 --> 0:14:39,000
it will destabilize not only our democracies,

277
0:14:39.92,000 --> 0:14:43,000
but even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy.

278
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
So if this analysis holds water, then Marx is absolutely relevant.

279
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:49,000
But so is Hayek,

280
0:14:49.76,000 --> 0:14:5,000
that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist,

281
0:14:51.6,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and so is Keynes,

282
0:14:52.84,000 --> 0:14:53,000
so that's why I'm totally confused.

283
0:14:54.76,000 --> 0:14:55,000
(Laughter)

284
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:58,000
BG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now.

285
0:14:58.08,000 --> 0:14:59,000
(Laughter)

286
0:14:59.4,000 --> 0:15:,000
(Applause)

287
0:15:01.4,000 --> 0:15:03,000
YV: If you are not confused, you are not thinking, OK?

288
0:15:04.2,000 --> 0:15:07,000
BG: That's a very, very Greek philosopher kind of thing to say --

289
0:15:07.32,000 --> 0:15:08,000
YV: That was Einstein, actually --

290
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:11,000
BG: During your talk you mentioned Singapore and China,

291
0:15:11.64,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and last night at the speaker dinner,

292
0:15:13.72,000 --> 0:15:18,000
you expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the West looks at China.

293
0:15:18.92,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Would you like to share that?

294
0:15:20.52,000 --> 0:15:22,000
YV: Well, there's a great degree of hypocrisy.

295
0:15:23.4,000 --> 0:15:27,000
In our liberal democracies, we have a semblance of democracy.

296
0:15:27.72,000 --> 0:15:29,000
It's because we have confined, as I was saying in my talk,

297
0:15:30.48,000 --> 0:15:31,000
democracy to the political sphere,

298
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
while leaving the one sphere where all the action is --

299
0:15:35.64,000 --> 0:15:36,000
the economic sphere --

300
0:15:36.88,000 --> 0:15:37,000
a completely democracy-free zone.

301
0:15:39.28,000 --> 0:15:4,000
In a sense,

302
0:15:40.56,000 --> 0:15:42,000
if I am allowed to be provocative,

303
0:15:43.88,000 --> 0:15:47,000
China today is closer to Britain in the 19th century.

304
0:15:48.32,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Because remember,

305
0:15:49.6,000 --> 0:15:51,000
we tend to associate liberalism with democracy --

306
0:15:51.96,000 --> 0:15:52,000
that's a mistake, historically.

307
0:15:53.48,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Liberalism, liberal, it's like John Stuart Mill.

308
0:15:56.04,000 --> 0:16:,000
John Stuart Mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process.

309
0:16:00.76,000 --> 0:16:05,000
So what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process

310
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
to the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution,

311
0:16:09.36,000 --> 0:16:11,000
especially the transition from the first to the second.

312
0:16:12.36,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And to be castigating China

313
0:16:15.68,000 --> 0:16:18,000
for doing that which the West did in the 19th century,

314
0:16:18.84,000 --> 0:16:19,000
smacks of hypocrisy.

315
0:16:21.52,000 --> 0:16:24,000
BG: I am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience

316
0:16:25.2,000 --> 0:16:27,000
as the Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year.

317
0:16:27.96,000 --> 0:16:28,000
YV: I knew this was coming.

318
0:16:29.365,000 --> 0:16:3,000
BG: Yes.

319
0:16:30.64,000 --> 0:16:31,000
BG: Six months after,

320
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:34,000
how do you look back at the first half of the year?

321
0:16:35.92,000 --> 0:16:37,000
YV: Extremely exciting, from a personal point of view,

322
0:16:38.56,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and very disappointing,

323
0:16:39.84,000 --> 0:16:42,000
because we had an opportunity to reboot the Eurozone.

324
0:16:43.76,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Not just Greece, the Eurozone.

325
0:16:45.88,000 --> 0:16:47,000
To move away from the complacency

326
0:16:48.84,000 --> 0:16:5,000
and the constant denial that there was a massive --

327
0:16:51.32,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and there is a massive architectural fault line

328
0:16:54.2,000 --> 0:16:56,000
going through the Eurozone,

329
0:16:56.4,000 --> 0:17:,000
which is threatening, massively, the whole of the European Union process.

330
0:17:00.84,000 --> 0:17:03,000
We had an opportunity on the basis of the Greek program --

331
0:17:04.04,000 --> 0:17:05,000
which by the way,

332
0:17:05.4,000 --> 0:17:09,000
was the first program to manifest that denial --

333
0:17:09.8,000 --> 0:17:1,000
to put it right.

334
0:17:11.04,000 --> 0:17:12,000
And, unfortunately,

335
0:17:12.28,000 --> 0:17:13,000
the powers in the Eurozone,

336
0:17:14.12,000 --> 0:17:15,000
in the Eurogroup,

337
0:17:16.079,000 --> 0:17:17,000
chose to maintain denial.

338
0:17:18.079,000 --> 0:17:19,000
But you know what happens.

339
0:17:19.359,000 --> 0:17:21,000
This is the experience of the Soviet Union.

340
0:17:21.44,000 --> 0:17:23,000
When you try to keep alive

341
0:17:23.96,000 --> 0:17:26,000
an economic system that architecturally cannot survive,

342
0:17:28.52,000 --> 0:17:3,000
through political will and through authoritarianism,

343
0:17:31.2,000 --> 0:17:32,000
you may succeed in prolonging it,

344
0:17:32.88,000 --> 0:17:33,000
but when change happens

345
0:17:34.48,000 --> 0:17:36,000
it happens very abruptly and catastrophically.

346
0:17:37,000 --> 0:17:39,000
BG: What kind of change are you foreseeing?

347
0:17:39.031,000 --> 0:17:4,000
YV: Well, there's no doubt

348
0:17:40.309,000 --> 0:17:42,000
that if we don't change the architecture of the Eurozone,

349
0:17:43.001,000 --> 0:17:44,000
the Eurozone has no future.

350
0:17:44.92,000 --> 0:17:46,000
BG: Did you make any mistakes when you were Finance Minister?

351
0:17:47.84,000 --> 0:17:48,000
YV: Every day.

352
0:17:49.08,000 --> 0:17:51,000
BG: For example? YV: Anybody who looks back --

353
0:17:51.64,000 --> 0:17:53,000
(Applause)

354
0:17:56.12,000 --> 0:17:57,000
No, but seriously.

355
0:17:57.52,000 --> 0:18:,000
If there's any Minister of Finance, or of anything else for that matter,

356
0:18:01.12,000 --> 0:18:03,000
who tells you after six months in a job,

357
0:18:03.36,000 --> 0:18:06,000
especially in such a stressful situation,

358
0:18:07.08,000 --> 0:18:09,000
that they have made no mistake, they're dangerous people.

359
0:18:09.8,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Of course I made mistakes.

360
0:18:11.12,000 --> 0:18:13,000
The greatest mistake was to sign the application

361
0:18:13.96,000 --> 0:18:15,000
for the extension of a loan agreement

362
0:18:16.08,000 --> 0:18:17,000
in the end of February.

363
0:18:17.72,000 --> 0:18:18,000
I was imagining

364
0:18:18.96,000 --> 0:18:2,000
that there was a genuine interest on the side of the creditors

365
0:18:21.96,000 --> 0:18:22,000
to find common ground.

366
0:18:23.24,000 --> 0:18:24,000
And there wasn't.

367
0:18:24.48,000 --> 0:18:26,000
They were simply interested in crushing our government,

368
0:18:27.12,000 --> 0:18:28,000
just because they did not want

369
0:18:28.6,000 --> 0:18:31,000
to have to deal with the architectural fault lines

370
0:18:31.76,000 --> 0:18:33,000
that were running through the Eurozone.

371
0:18:33.8,000 --> 0:18:34,000
And because they didn't want to admit

372
0:18:35.64,000 --> 0:18:38,000
that for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in Greece.

373
0:18:39.28,000 --> 0:18:41,000
We lost one-third of our nominal GDP.

374
0:18:42.2,000 --> 0:18:43,000
This is worse than the Great Depression.

375
0:18:44.16,000 --> 0:18:45,000
And no one has come clean

376
0:18:45.44,000 --> 0:18:47,000
from the troika of lenders that have been imposing this policy

377
0:18:48.4,000 --> 0:18:5,000
to say, "This was a colossal mistake."

378
0:18:51.4,000 --> 0:18:52,000
BG: Despite all this,

379
0:18:52.64,000 --> 0:18:54,000
and despite the aggressiveness of the discussion,

380
0:18:55,000 --> 0:18:57,000
you seem to be remaining quite pro-European.

381
0:18:57.44,000 --> 0:18:58,000
YV: Absolutely.

382
0:18:58.68,000 --> 0:19:02,000
Look, my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone

383
0:19:02.84,000 --> 0:19:06,000
comes from a person who lives and breathes Europe.

384
0:19:07.68,000 --> 0:19:1,000
My greatest fear is that the Eurozone will not survive.

385
0:19:11.28,000 --> 0:19:12,000
Because if it doesn't,

386
0:19:12.76,000 --> 0:19:14,000
the centrifugal forces that will be unleashed

387
0:19:15.64,000 --> 0:19:16,000
will be demonic,

388
0:19:17.36,000 --> 0:19:18,000
and they will destroy the European Union.

389
0:19:19.36,000 --> 0:19:21,000
And that will be catastrophic not just for Europe

390
0:19:21.8,000 --> 0:19:22,000
but for the whole global economy.

391
0:19:23.44,000 --> 0:19:27,000
We are probably the largest economy in the world.

392
0:19:27.56,000 --> 0:19:28,000
And if we allow ourselves

393
0:19:29.32,000 --> 0:19:31,000
to fall into a route of the postmodern 1930's,

394
0:19:32.16,000 --> 0:19:34,000
which seems to me to be what we are doing,

395
0:19:34.84,000 --> 0:19:35,000
then that will be detrimental

396
0:19:36.68,000 --> 0:19:39,000
to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans alike.

397
0:19:40.12,000 --> 0:19:42,000
BG: We definitely hope you are wrong on that point.

398
0:19:42.56,000 --> 0:19:43,000
Yanis, thank you for coming to TED.

399
0:19:44.28,000 --> 0:19:45,000
YV: Thank you.

400
0:19:45.52,000 --> 0:19:49,000
(Applause)

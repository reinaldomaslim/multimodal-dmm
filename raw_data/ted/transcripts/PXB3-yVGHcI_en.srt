1
0:00:13.524,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Languages don't just die naturally.

2
0:00:16.706,000 --> 0:00:19,000
People abandon mother tongues, because they're forced to.

3
0:00:20.651,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Often, the pressure is political.

4
0:00:23.781,000 --> 0:00:24,000
In 1892,

5
0:00:25.201,000 --> 0:00:27,000
the US Army general Richard Henry Pratt

6
0:00:27.471,000 --> 0:00:29,000
argued that killing indigenous cultures

7
0:00:30.003,000 --> 0:00:32,000
was the only alternative to killing indigenous people.

8
0:00:33.863,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"Kill the Indian," he said, "but save the man."

9
0:00:37.688,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And until 1978, the government did just that,

10
0:00:40.932,000 --> 0:00:43,000
removing indigenous children from their families

11
0:00:44.211,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and forcing them into boarding schools where they were given English names

12
0:00:47.731,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and punished for speaking their languages.

13
0:00:50.75,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Assimilation was a compliment to genocide.

14
0:00:56.029,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Seven thousand languages are alive today,

15
0:00:58.481,000 --> 0:01:,000
but few are recognized by their own governments

16
0:01:00.957,000 --> 0:01:01,000
or supported online.

17
0:01:02.919,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So for people from the vast majority of cultures,

18
0:01:05.498,000 --> 0:01:08,000
globalization remains profoundly alienating.

19
0:01:08.919,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It means giving up your language for someone else's.

20
0:01:13.53,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And if nothing changes,

21
0:01:14.735,000 --> 0:01:18,000
as many as 3,000 languages could disappear in 80 years.

22
0:01:20.244,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But things are changing.

23
0:01:22.347,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Around the world,

24
0:01:23.617,000 --> 0:01:25,000
people are reviving ancestral languages

25
0:01:26.212,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and rebuilding their cultures.

26
0:01:29.268,000 --> 0:01:3,000
As far as we know,

27
0:01:30.823,000 --> 0:01:34,000
language reclamation began in the 1800s when, at a time of rising antisemitism,

28
0:01:35.434,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Jewish communities looked to their ancestral language, Hebrew,

29
0:01:38.585,000 --> 0:01:4,000
as a means of cultural revival.

30
0:01:42.173,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And though it had been dormant for over 1,000 years,

31
0:01:44.665,000 --> 0:01:47,000
it was well preserved in books of Jewish religion and philosophy.

32
0:01:48.569,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So Jewish activists studied and taught it to their children,

33
0:01:51.696,000 --> 0:01:54,000
raising the first native speakers in nearly 100 generations.

34
0:01:56.204,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Today, it's the mother tongue of five million Jews.

35
0:01:59.783,000 --> 0:02:,000
And at least for me,

36
0:02:01.561,000 --> 0:02:04,000
an assimilated English-speaking member of the Jewish diaspora,

37
0:02:05.458,000 --> 0:02:07,000
a pillar of cultural sovereignty.

38
0:02:09.315,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Two thousand years later,

39
0:02:11.641,000 --> 0:02:12,000
we're still here.

40
0:02:14.657,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Now, until recently,

41
0:02:16.093,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Hebrew's reawakening was an anomaly.

42
0:02:18.604,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Few languages are as well preserved as ours was,

43
0:02:21.263,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and the creation of Israel,

44
0:02:23.041,000 --> 0:02:25,000
the first Jewish state in over 1,000 years,

45
0:02:25.699,000 --> 0:02:27,000
provided a space for Hebrew's daily use.

46
0:02:29.188,000 --> 0:02:32,000
In other words, most cultures just weren't given a chance.

47
0:02:32.546,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Video) Good evening, I'm Elizabeth

48
0:02:34.733,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and I live in Cornwall.

49
0:02:37.173,000 --> 0:02:38,000
That was Cornish,

50
0:02:38.353,000 --> 0:02:39,000
the ancestral language of Cornwall,

51
0:02:40.362,000 --> 0:02:43,000
which today is technically a county in southern England.

52
0:02:44.641,000 --> 0:02:47,000
In the 1900s, Cornish activists fought for their culture.

53
0:02:48.739,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The language had been dormant for over 100 years,

54
0:02:51.072,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but they used old books and plays to teach it to their children.

55
0:02:55.239,000 --> 0:02:57,000
However, this new generation of Cornish speakers

56
0:02:57.8,000 --> 0:02:58,000
was scattered across Cornwall

57
0:02:59.307,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and unable to use the language freely.

58
0:03:02.538,000 --> 0:03:05,000
By the 1990s, Cornish had reawakened,

59
0:03:05.911,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but it wasn't thriving.

60
0:03:08.839,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Then, in the early 2000s, Cornish speakers found one another online

61
0:03:13.275,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and leveraged digital spaces to speak on a daily basis.

62
0:03:17.934,000 --> 0:03:19,000
From there, they organized weekly or monthly events

63
0:03:20.642,000 --> 0:03:22,000
where they could gather and speak in public.

64
0:03:24.005,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Today, some schools teach Cornish.

65
0:03:27.117,000 --> 0:03:29,000
There are Cornish language signs,

66
0:03:29.292,000 --> 0:03:3,000
ice-cream commercials,

67
0:03:30.744,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Wikipedia, and even memes.

68
0:03:34.252,000 --> 0:03:36,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:37.815,000 --> 0:03:4,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:42.393,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And with their language once again intact,

71
0:03:44.544,000 --> 0:03:46,000
the people of Cornwall have secured recognition

72
0:03:46.917,000 --> 0:03:49,000
as a Celtic nation alongside Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

73
0:03:50.782,000 --> 0:03:52,000
They stared down centuries of forced assimilation

74
0:03:53.394,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and said, "We're not a county in England.

75
0:03:55.784,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We're a people in our own right.

76
0:03:57.784,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And we're still here."

77
0:03:59.648,000 --> 0:04:,000
And they're not the only ones.

78
0:04:01.141,000 --> 0:04:05,000
The Tunica-Biloxi tribe of Louisiana is reviving their ancestral language.

79
0:04:05.902,000 --> 0:04:06,000
(Video) My name is Teyanna.

80
0:04:07.887,000 --> 0:04:1,000
My friends, they call me "Quiet Storm."

81
0:04:11.706,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It started in the 1980s,

82
0:04:13.73,000 --> 0:04:14,000
when Donna Pierite and her family

83
0:04:15.635,000 --> 0:04:17,000
started taking trips to Baton Rouge and New Orleans

84
0:04:18.253,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to photocopy old dictionaries stored away in university archives.

85
0:04:22.717,000 --> 0:04:24,000
The goal was to study Tunica

86
0:04:25.305,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and teach it to the children and share it with the community.

87
0:04:29.051,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Today, they're leading a Tunica renaissance.

88
0:04:33.355,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Since 2014, there are nearly 100 speakers in language immersion classes,

89
0:04:38.411,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and according to a 2017 census,

90
0:04:40.903,000 --> 0:04:42,000
32 new fluent speakers,

91
0:04:43.561,000 --> 0:04:45,000
some of whom, like Donna's daughter Elisabeth,

92
0:04:46.395,000 --> 0:04:47,000
are teaching Tunica to their children.

93
0:04:48.3,000 --> 0:04:5,000
These new speakers are creating content,

94
0:04:50.385,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Facebook videos and also memes.

95
0:04:52.89,000 --> 0:04:53,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:56.18,000 --> 0:04:57,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:58.999,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:01.166,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And the more they publish,

99
0:05:02.46,000 --> 0:05:04,000
the more they inspire other Tunica people to get involved.

100
0:05:05.666,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Recently, a tribal member living in Texas wrote Elisabeth on Facebook,

101
0:05:10.077,000 --> 0:05:12,000
asking how to say "bless these lands."

102
0:05:13.593,000 --> 0:05:14,000
It was for a yard sign,

103
0:05:15.442,000 --> 0:05:17,000
so she could show her neighbors that her culture is alive

104
0:05:18.212,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and thriving today.

105
0:05:20.514,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Now, Hebrew, Cornish and Tunica

106
0:05:22.561,000 --> 0:05:26,000
are just three examples from a groundswell of language activism on every continent.

107
0:05:27.649,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And whether they're Jèrriais speakers from the Channel Isles,

108
0:05:30.634,000 --> 0:05:34,000
or Kenyan sign language speakers from Nairobi,

109
0:05:34.911,000 --> 0:05:37,000
all communities working to preserve or reclaim a language

110
0:05:38.244,000 --> 0:05:4,000
have one thing in common: media,

111
0:05:41.148,000 --> 0:05:43,000
so their language can be shared and taught.

112
0:05:43.936,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And as the internet grows,

113
0:05:46.055,000 --> 0:05:48,000
expanding media access and creation,

114
0:05:49.586,000 --> 0:05:52,000
preserving and reclaiming ancestral languages

115
0:05:52.681,000 --> 0:05:53,000
is now more possible than ever.

116
0:05:55.6,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So what are your ancestral languages?

117
0:05:58.02,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Mine are Hebrew, Yiddish, Hungarian and Scottish Gaelic,

118
0:06:01.163,000 --> 0:06:03,000
even though I was raised in English.

119
0:06:03.854,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And luckily for me, each of these languages is available online.

120
0:06:07.532,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Hebrew in particular -- it came installed on my iPhone,

121
0:06:10.27,000 --> 0:06:11,000
it's supported by Google Translate,

122
0:06:12.111,000 --> 0:06:13,000
it even has autocorrect.

123
0:06:14.024,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And while your language may not be as widely supported,

124
0:06:17.014,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I encourage you to investigate,

125
0:06:18.589,000 --> 0:06:21,000
because chances are, someone, somewhere, has started getting it online.

126
0:06:23.877,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Reclaiming your language and embracing your culture

127
0:06:28.695,000 --> 0:06:31,000
is a powerful way to be yourself in the age of globalization,

128
0:06:32.56,000 --> 0:06:35,000
because as I recently learned to say in Hebrew,

129
0:06:35.905,000 --> 0:06:37,000

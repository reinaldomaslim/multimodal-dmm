1
0:00:13.286,000 --> 0:00:17,000
If you were to jump into any random spot in the ocean,

2
0:00:17.762,000 --> 0:00:19,000
you would probably see something like this.

3
0:00:20.897,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Empty of large animals.

4
0:00:23.879,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Because we have taken them out of the water

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
faster than they can reproduce.

6
0:00:29.61,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Today I want to propose a strategy to save ocean life,

7
0:00:33.165,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and the solution has a lot to do with economics.

8
0:00:36.316,000 --> 0:00:4,000
In 1999, a little place called Cabo Pulmo in Mexico

9
0:00:40.434,000 --> 0:00:41,000
was an underwater desert.

10
0:00:42.728,000 --> 0:00:46,000
The fishermen were so upset not having enough fish to catch

11
0:00:46.776,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that they did something that no one expected.

12
0:00:49.784,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Instead of spending more time at sea, trying to catch the few fish left,

13
0:00:53.911,000 --> 0:00:55,000
they stopped fishing completely.

14
0:00:57.498,000 --> 0:00:59,000
They created a national park in the sea.

15
0:01:00.576,000 --> 0:01:02,000
A no-take marine reserve.

16
0:01:04.141,000 --> 0:01:08,000
When we returned, 10 years later, this is what we saw.

17
0:01:09.87,000 --> 0:01:12,000
What had been an underwater barren

18
0:01:13.616,000 --> 0:01:16,000
was now a kaleidoscope of life and color.

19
0:01:17.14,000 --> 0:01:2,000
We saw it back to pristine in only 10 years.

20
0:01:20.704,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Including the return of the large predators,

21
0:01:22.942,000 --> 0:01:25,000
like the groupers, the sharks, the jacks.

22
0:01:26.823,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And those visionary fishermen

23
0:01:29.244,000 --> 0:01:32,000
are making much more money now, from tourism.

24
0:01:34.066,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Now, when we can align economic needs with conservation,

25
0:01:37.925,000 --> 0:01:38,000
miracles can happen.

26
0:01:40.314,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And we have seen similar recoveries all over the world.

27
0:01:44.672,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I spent 20 years studying human impacts in the ocean.

28
0:01:50.379,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But when I saw firsthand the regeneration of places like Cabo Pulmo,

29
0:01:57.037,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that gave me hope.

30
0:01:59.052,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So I decided to quit my job as a university professor

31
0:02:03.871,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to dedicate my life to save more ocean places like this.

32
0:02:09.053,000 --> 0:02:13,000
In the last 10 years, our team at National Geographic Pristine Seas

33
0:02:13.712,000 --> 0:02:16,000
has explored, surveyed and documented

34
0:02:16.974,000 --> 0:02:18,000
some of the wildest places left in the ocean

35
0:02:19.839,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and worked with governments to protect them.

36
0:02:22.704,000 --> 0:02:26,000
These are all now protected, covering a total area half the size of Canada.

37
0:02:27.531,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Applause)

38
0:02:32.958,000 --> 0:02:37,000
These places are the Yellowstones and the Serengetis of the sea.

39
0:02:39.567,000 --> 0:02:41,000
These are places where you jump in the water

40
0:02:42.345,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and are immediately surrounded by sharks.

41
0:02:45.036,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:46.504,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And this is good,

43
0:02:48.161,000 --> 0:02:51,000
because the sharks are a good indicator of the health of the ecosystem.

44
0:02:52.998,000 --> 0:02:54,000
These places are time machines

45
0:02:55.474,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that take us to the ocean of 1,000 years ago.

46
0:02:58.553,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But they also show us what the future ocean could be like.

47
0:03:03.097,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Because the ocean has extraordinary regenerative power,

48
0:03:07.185,000 --> 0:03:09,000
we have seen great recovery in just a few years.

49
0:03:10.383,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We just need to protect many more places at risk

50
0:03:14.136,000 --> 0:03:17,000
so they can become wild and full of life again.

51
0:03:18.069,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But today, only two percent of the ocean

52
0:03:22.021,000 --> 0:03:25,000
is fully protected from fishing and other activities.

53
0:03:26.03,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And that's not enough.

54
0:03:28.409,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Studies suggest that we need at least 30 percent of the ocean under protection

55
0:03:33.243,000 --> 0:03:36,000
not just to save marine life, but to save us, too.

56
0:03:36.284,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Because the ocean gives us more than half of the oxygen we breathe, food,

57
0:03:41.707,000 --> 0:03:43,000
it absorbs much of the carbon pollution

58
0:03:44.228,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that we throw in the atmosphere.

59
0:03:46.72,000 --> 0:03:48,000
We need a healthy ocean to survive.

60
0:03:50.529,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Now, is there a way to accelerate ocean protection?

61
0:03:55.49,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I think so.

62
0:03:57.077,000 --> 0:04:,000
And it involves us looking at the high seas.

63
0:04:01.165,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Now, what are the high seas?

64
0:04:02.8,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Now coastal countries have authority over 200 nautical miles from shore.

65
0:04:09.187,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Everything beyond those areas are called the high seas.

66
0:04:13.165,000 --> 0:04:14,000
In dark blue on this map.

67
0:04:15.363,000 --> 0:04:17,000
No country owns the high seas,

68
0:04:17.815,000 --> 0:04:19,000
no country is responsible for them,

69
0:04:20.149,000 --> 0:04:23,000
but they all are, so it's a little like the Wild West.

70
0:04:23.923,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And there are two main types of fishing in the high seas.

71
0:04:26.645,000 --> 0:04:28,000
At the bottom and near the surface.

72
0:04:29.668,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Bottom trawling is the most destructive practice in the world.

73
0:04:35.067,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Super trawlers, the largest fishing vessels in the ocean,

74
0:04:38.623,000 --> 0:04:44,000
have nets so large that they can hold a dozen 747 jets.

75
0:04:46.417,000 --> 0:04:5,000
These huge nets destroy everything in their paths --

76
0:04:51.235,000 --> 0:04:54,000
including deep corals that grow on sea mounds,

77
0:04:54.592,000 --> 0:04:56,000
which can be thousands of years old.

78
0:04:57.284,000 --> 0:05:,000
And fishing near the surface targets mostly species

79
0:05:00.617,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that migrate between the high seas and country's waters,

80
0:05:03.68,000 --> 0:05:04,000
like tuna and sharks.

81
0:05:05.72,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And many of these species are threatened because of too much fishing

82
0:05:09.101,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and bad management.

83
0:05:11.133,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Now, who fishes in the high seas?

84
0:05:14.228,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Until now, it was difficult to know exactly,

85
0:05:17.474,000 --> 0:05:19,000
because countries have been very secretive

86
0:05:19.815,000 --> 0:05:21,000
about the long-distance fishing.

87
0:05:22.252,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But now, satellite technology allows us to track individual boats.

88
0:05:28.799,000 --> 0:05:29,000
This is a game-changer.

89
0:05:31.583,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And this is the first time

90
0:05:32.886,000 --> 0:05:35,000
we are presenting the data that you are going to see.

91
0:05:37.179,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I'm going to show you the tracks of two boats

92
0:05:39.854,000 --> 0:05:41,000
over the course of a year,

93
0:05:42.212,000 --> 0:05:45,000
using a satellite automated identification system.

94
0:05:46.386,000 --> 0:05:5,000
This is a long-liner, fishing around the southern coast of Africa.

95
0:05:51.457,000 --> 0:05:55,000
After a few months fishing there, the boat goes to Japan to resupply,

96
0:05:56.125,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and shortly after, here it is, fishing around Madagascar.

97
0:06:00.371,000 --> 0:06:05,000
This is a Russian trawler fishing, probably, for cod,

98
0:06:05.72,000 --> 0:06:06,000
in Russian waters,

99
0:06:06.958,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and then across the high seas of the north Atlantic.

100
0:06:10.895,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Thanks to Global Fishing Watch,

101
0:06:13.03,000 --> 0:06:17,000
we have been able to track over 3,600 boats

102
0:06:17.498,000 --> 0:06:2,000
from more than 20 countries, fishing in the high seas.

103
0:06:21.625,000 --> 0:06:24,000
They use satellite positioning and machine-learning technology

104
0:06:25.332,000 --> 0:06:29,000
to automatically identify if a boat is just sailing or fishing,

105
0:06:30.14,000 --> 0:06:31,000
which are the white spots here.

106
0:06:32.719,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So with an international group of colleagues,

107
0:06:34.862,000 --> 0:06:35,000
we decided to investigate

108
0:06:36.703,000 --> 0:06:4,000
not only who fishes in the high seas, but who benefits from it.

109
0:06:42.14,000 --> 0:06:43,000
My colleague, Juan Mayorga,

110
0:06:43.597,000 --> 0:06:45,000
at the University of California, Santa Barbara,

111
0:06:45.847,000 --> 0:06:47,000
has produced detailed maps of fishing effort,

112
0:06:48.061,000 --> 0:06:5,000
which means how much time and fuel is spent fishing

113
0:06:51.064,000 --> 0:06:52,000
in every pixel in the ocean.

114
0:06:53.68,000 --> 0:06:55,000
We have a map for every country.

115
0:06:56.561,000 --> 0:06:59,000
China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea and Spain alone

116
0:07:00.133,000 --> 0:07:03,000
account for almost 80 percent of the fishing in the high seas.

117
0:07:04.768,000 --> 0:07:06,000
When we put all of the countries together,

118
0:07:07.427,000 --> 0:07:08,000
this is what we get.

119
0:07:09.792,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Because we know the identity of every boat in the database,

120
0:07:15.387,000 --> 0:07:19,000
we know its size, its tonnage, the power of its engines,

121
0:07:19.752,000 --> 0:07:2,000
how many crew are on board.

122
0:07:22.046,000 --> 0:07:26,000
With this information, we can calculate fuel costs, labor costs, etc.

123
0:07:27.157,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So for the first time,

124
0:07:29.111,000 --> 0:07:33,000
we have been able to map the costs of fishing in the high seas.

125
0:07:34.315,000 --> 0:07:36,000
The darker the red, the higher the costs.

126
0:07:37.855,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Thanks to our colleagues at the University of British Columbia,

127
0:07:40.871,000 --> 0:07:43,000
we know how much every country is actually fishing.

128
0:07:44.268,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And we know the price of the fish as it comes off the vessel.

129
0:07:48.038,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Combined with the data on effort,

130
0:07:50.427,000 --> 0:07:53,000
we have been able to map the revenue of fishing the high seas.

131
0:07:54.879,000 --> 0:07:56,000
The darker the blue, the higher the revenue.

132
0:07:57.982,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We have costs, and we have revenue.

133
0:08:00.887,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So for the first time,

134
0:08:02.53,000 --> 0:08:07,000
we have been able to map the profitability of fishing in the high seas.

135
0:08:08.863,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Now I'm going to show you a map.

136
0:08:10.712,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Red colors mean we are losing money by fishing in that part of the ocean.

137
0:08:16.641,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Blue colors mean it's profitable.

138
0:08:19.619,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Here it is.

139
0:08:21.707,000 --> 0:08:23,000
It seems mostly profitable.

140
0:08:23.77,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But there are two more factors we have to take into account.

141
0:08:28.635,000 --> 0:08:31,000
First, recent investigations reveal

142
0:08:32.23,000 --> 0:08:35,000
the use of forced labor, or slave labor,

143
0:08:35.736,000 --> 0:08:36,000
in high seas fishing.

144
0:08:37.641,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Companies use it to cut costs, to generate profits.

145
0:08:42.135,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And second, every year, governments subsidize high seas fishing

146
0:08:47.491,000 --> 0:08:49,000
with more than four billion dollars.

147
0:08:51.27,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Let's go back to the map of profits.

148
0:08:53.032,000 --> 0:08:55,000
If we assume fair wages,

149
0:08:55.332,000 --> 0:08:57,000
which means not slave labor,

150
0:08:57.873,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and we remove the subsidies from our calculation,

151
0:09:02.19,000 --> 0:09:04,000
the map turns into this.

152
0:09:05.807,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Fishing is truly profitable in only half of the high seas fishing grounds.

153
0:09:12.992,000 --> 0:09:14,000
In fact, on aggregate,

154
0:09:15.285,000 --> 0:09:19,000
subsidies are four times larger than the profits.

155
0:09:20.548,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So we have five countries doing most of the fishing in the high seas

156
0:09:24.056,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and the economics are dependent on huge government subsidies,

157
0:09:27.596,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and for some countries, on human rights violations.

158
0:09:32.099,000 --> 0:09:34,000
What this economic analysis reveals,

159
0:09:34.378,000 --> 0:09:37,000
is that practically the entire high seas fishing proposition is misguided.

160
0:09:38.647,000 --> 0:09:41,000
What sane government would subsidize an industry

161
0:09:42.442,000 --> 0:09:45,000
anchored in exploitation and fundamentally destructive?

162
0:09:46.625,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And not so profitable, anyway.

163
0:09:49.307,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So, why don't we close all of the high seas to fishing?

164
0:09:56.842,000 --> 0:10:,000
Let's create a giant high seas reserve, two-thirds of the ocean.

165
0:10:03.438,000 --> 0:10:04,000
A modeling study from --

166
0:10:05.249,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Applause)

167
0:10:09.351,000 --> 0:10:11,000
A modeling study from colleagues at UC Santa Barbara,

168
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
suggests that such reserve would help migratory species like tuna

169
0:10:15.903,000 --> 0:10:16,000
recover in the high seas.

170
0:10:17.577,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And part of that increased abundance would spill over into the countries' waters,

171
0:10:21.882,000 --> 0:10:22,000
helping to replenish them.

172
0:10:23.66,000 --> 0:10:26,000
That would also increase the catch in these waters,

173
0:10:26.755,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and so would the profits,

174
0:10:28.096,000 --> 0:10:3,000
because the cost of fishing would be lowered.

175
0:10:30.787,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And the ecological benefits would be huge,

176
0:10:34.463,000 --> 0:10:37,000
because these species of large predators, like tuna and sharks,

177
0:10:37.779,000 --> 0:10:39,000
are key to the health of the entire ecosystem.

178
0:10:41.606,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Therefore, protecting the high seas

179
0:10:44.133,000 --> 0:10:47,000
would have ecological, economic and social benefits.

180
0:10:48.395,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But the truth is that most fishing companies

181
0:10:50.728,000 --> 0:10:51,000
don't care about the environment.

182
0:10:52.617,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But they would make more money by not fishing in the high seas.

183
0:10:56.307,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And this would not affect our ability to feed our growing population,

184
0:11:01.8,000 --> 0:11:06,000
because the high seas provide only five percent of the global marine catch,

185
0:11:08.184,000 --> 0:11:11,000
because the high seas are not as productive as near-shore waters.

186
0:11:12.438,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And most of the catch of the high seas is sold as upscale food items,

187
0:11:17.419,000 --> 0:11:2,000
like tuna sashimi or shark fin soup.

188
0:11:21.895,000 --> 0:11:25,000
The high seas catch does not contribute to global food security.

189
0:11:28.117,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So how are we going to do it?

190
0:11:29.561,000 --> 0:11:31,000
How are we going to protect the high seas?

191
0:11:32.022,000 --> 0:11:34,000
As we speak, negotiators at the United Nations

192
0:11:34.649,000 --> 0:11:37,000
are beginning discussions on a new agreement to do just that.

193
0:11:38.728,000 --> 0:11:4,000
But this cannot happen behind closed doors.

194
0:11:42.077,000 --> 0:11:44,000
This is our greatest opportunity.

195
0:11:44.323,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And we all should ensure

196
0:11:46.062,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that our countries will support the protection of the high seas

197
0:11:51.157,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and get rid of subsidies to industrial fishing.

198
0:11:55.395,000 --> 0:12:,000
In 2016, 24 countries and the European Union

199
0:12:00.784,000 --> 0:12:03,000
agreed to protect the Ross Sea,

200
0:12:04.053,000 --> 0:12:06,000
the wildest places in Antarctica,

201
0:12:06.458,000 --> 0:12:1,000
full of wildlife like killer whales, leopard seals, penguins.

202
0:12:10.974,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And this included fishing nations, like China, Japan, Spain, Russia.

203
0:12:16.228,000 --> 0:12:2,000
But they decided that protecting such a unique environment

204
0:12:21.193,000 --> 0:12:25,000
would be worth more than exploiting it for relatively little benefit.

205
0:12:25.883,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And this is exactly the type of cooperation

206
0:12:29.403,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and willingness to set aside differences

207
0:12:31.388,000 --> 0:12:32,000
that we are going to need.

208
0:12:32.725,000 --> 0:12:33,000
We can do it again.

209
0:12:35.315,000 --> 0:12:37,000
If 20 years from now,

210
0:12:37.927,000 --> 0:12:41,000
our children were to jump into any random spot in the ocean,

211
0:12:43.451,000 --> 0:12:44,000
what would they see?

212
0:12:45.737,000 --> 0:12:49,000
A barren landscape, like much of our seas today,

213
0:12:50.257,000 --> 0:12:52,000
or an abundance of life, our legacy to the future?

214
0:12:53.665,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Thank you very much.

215
0:12:55.016,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Applause)

216
0:12:58,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Thank you.

217
0:12:59.226,000 --> 0:13:03,000
(Applause)

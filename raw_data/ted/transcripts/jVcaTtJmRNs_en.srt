0:00:57.518,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Applause)

17
0:01:04.744,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Maya Penn: I've been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon,

18
0:01:08.033,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and I've been making animated flip books

19
0:01:10.116,000 --> 0:01:11,000
since I was three years old.

20
0:01:12.056,000 --> 0:01:15,000
At that age, I also learned about what an animator was.

21
0:01:15.25,000 --> 0:01:17,000
There was a program on TV about jobs

22
0:01:17.583,000 --> 0:01:18,000
most kids don't know about.

23
0:01:19.345,000 --> 0:01:2,000
When I understood that an animator

24
0:01:21.101,000 --> 0:01:22,000
makes the cartoons I saw on TV,

25
0:01:22.933,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I immediately said, "That's what I want to be."

26
0:01:26.714,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I don't know if I said it mentally or out loud,

27
0:01:29.016,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but that was a greatly defining moment in my life.

28
0:01:32.9,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Animation and art has always been my first love.

29
0:01:37.227,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It was my love for technology that sparked the idea

30
0:01:39.35,000 --> 0:01:4,000
for "Malicious Dishes."

31
0:01:41.216,000 --> 0:01:42,000
There was a virus on my computer,

32
0:01:42.955,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and I was trying to get rid of it,

33
0:01:44.602,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and all of a sudden, I just thought,

34
0:01:46.478,000 --> 0:01:48,000
what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer?

35
0:01:49.418,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Maybe a restaurant where they meet up

36
0:01:51.537,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and do virusy things?

37
0:01:53.13,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And thus, "Malicious Dishes" was born.

38
0:01:56.502,000 --> 0:01:58,000
At four years old, my dad showed me

39
0:01:58.645,000 --> 0:02:,000
how to take apart a computer and put it back together again.

40
0:02:01.513,000 --> 0:02:03,000
That started my love for technology.

41
0:02:04.123,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I built my first website myself in HTML,

42
0:02:07.154,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and I'm learning JavaScript and Python.

43
0:02:09.671,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I'm also working on an animated series

44
0:02:11.41,000 --> 0:02:12,000
called "The Pollinators."

45
0:02:12.665,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's about bees and other pollinators in our environment

46
0:02:14.881,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and why they're so important.

47
0:02:17.25,000 --> 0:02:19,000
If plants aren't pollinated by the pollinators,

48
0:02:19.86,000 --> 0:02:2,000
then all creatures, including ourselves,

49
0:02:21.769,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that depend on these plants, would starve.

50
0:02:24.285,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So I decided to take these cool creatures

51
0:02:26.493,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and make a superhero team.

52
0:02:30.312,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Applause)

53
0:02:38.202,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Foot stomp)

54
0:02:41.376,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Music)

55
0:02:48.028,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Roar)

56
0:02:50.154,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Pollinator: Deforestsaurus! I should have known!

57
0:02:52.631,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators!

58
0:02:55.049,000 --> 0:03:,000
(Music)

59
0:03:07.032,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Thank you. (Applause)

60
0:03:09.524,000 --> 0:03:12,000
All of my animations start with ideas,

61
0:03:12.602,000 --> 0:03:15,000
but what are ideas?

62
0:03:16.337,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Ideas can spark a movement.

63
0:03:19.34,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Ideas are opportunities and innovation.

64
0:03:23.009,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Ideas truly are what make the world go round.

65
0:03:26.628,000 --> 0:03:28,000
If it wasn't for ideas, we wouldn't be

66
0:03:29.055,000 --> 0:03:3,000
where we are now with technology, medicine,

67
0:03:31.038,000 --> 0:03:35,000
art, culture, and how we even live our lives.

68
0:03:35.125,000 --> 0:03:37,000
At eight years old, I took my ideas

69
0:03:37.387,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and started my own business called Maya's Ideas,

70
0:03:40.331,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and my nonprofit, Maya's Ideas for the Planet.

71
0:03:43.107,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:44.853,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories.

73
0:03:48.304,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I'm 13 now, and although I started my business

74
0:03:50.974,000 --> 0:03:51,000
in 2008,

75
0:03:52.386,000 --> 0:03:55,000
my artistic journey started way before then.

76
0:03:55.696,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I was greatly influenced by art, and I wanted to

77
0:03:57.986,000 --> 0:04:,000
incorporate it in everything I did, even my business.

78
0:04:01.006,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I would find different fabrics around the house,

79
0:04:03.009,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and say, &quot;This could be a scarf or a hat,&quot;

80
0:04:05.264,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and I had all these ideas for designs.

81
0:04:08.374,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I noticed when I wore my creations,

82
0:04:10.227,000 --> 0:04:11,000
people would stop me and say,

83
0:04:11.675,000 --> 0:04:13,000
"Wow, that's really cute. Where can I get one?"

84
0:04:13.732,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And I thought, I can start my own business.

85
0:04:16.915,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Now I didn't have any business plans

86
0:04:18.789,000 --> 0:04:19,000
at only eight years old.

87
0:04:20.557,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations

88
0:04:22.584,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that were safe for the environment

89
0:04:23.839,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and I wanted to give back.

90
0:04:25.877,000 --> 0:04:26,000
My mom taught me how to sew,

91
0:04:27.7,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and on my back porch, I would sit and make

92
0:04:29.697,000 --> 0:04:3,000
little headbands out of ribbon,

93
0:04:31.218,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and I would write down the names and the price of each item.

94
0:04:33.818,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I started making more items like hats,

95
0:04:35.888,000 --> 0:04:37,000
scarves and bags.

96
0:04:38.094,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Soon, my items began selling all over the world,

97
0:04:40.489,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and I had customers in Denmark, Italy, Australia,

98
0:04:43.318,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Canada and more.

99
0:04:45.925,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Now, I had a lot to learn about my business,

100
0:04:48.509,000 --> 0:04:49,000
like branding and marketing,

101
0:04:50.184,000 --> 0:04:51,000
staying engaged with my customers,

102
0:04:51.942,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and seeing what sold the most and the least.

103
0:04:55.423,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Soon, my business really started to take off.

104
0:04:57.837,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Then one day, Forbes magazine contacted me when I was 10 years old.

105
0:05:02.084,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:03.677,000 --> 0:05:05,000
They wanted to feature me and my company

107
0:05:06.014,000 --> 0:05:08,000
in their article.

108
0:05:08.036,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Now a lot of people ask me,

109
0:05:10.117,000 --> 0:05:12,000
why is your business eco-friendly?

110
0:05:12.543,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I've had a passion for protecting the environment

111
0:05:15.067,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and its creatures since I was little.

112
0:05:17.108,000 --> 0:05:18,000
My parents taught me at an early age

113
0:05:19.025,000 --> 0:05:22,000
about giving back and being a good steward to the environment.

114
0:05:22.319,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I heard about how the dyes in some clothing

115
0:05:24.385,000 --> 0:05:26,000
or the process of even making the items

116
0:05:26.531,000 --> 0:05:28,000
was harmful to the people and the planet,

117
0:05:29.11,000 --> 0:05:31,000
so I started doing my own research,

118
0:05:31.259,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and I discovered that even after dyeing has being completed,

119
0:05:34.364,000 --> 0:05:36,000
there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact

120
0:05:36.39,000 --> 0:05:37,000
on the environment.

121
0:05:38.004,000 --> 0:05:39,000
For example, the grinding of materials,

122
0:05:39.987,000 --> 0:05:41,000
or the dumping of dried powder materials.

123
0:05:42.718,000 --> 0:05:43,000
These actions can pollute the air,

124
0:05:44.418,000 --> 0:05:47,000
making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it.

125
0:05:48.181,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So when I started my business,

126
0:05:49.645,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I knew two things:

127
0:05:52.001,000 --> 0:05:54,000
All of my items had to be eco-friendly,

128
0:05:54.713,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made

129
0:05:56.982,000 --> 0:05:57,000
went to local and global charities

130
0:05:58.642,000 --> 0:06:,000
and environmental organizations.

131
0:06:00.719,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Applause)

132
0:06:04.587,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I feel I'm part of the new wave of entrepreneurs

133
0:06:07.136,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that not only seeks to have a successful business,

134
0:06:09.398,000 --> 0:06:11,000
but also a sustainable future.

135
0:06:12.174,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers

136
0:06:14.163,000 --> 0:06:16,000
without compromising the ability of future generations

137
0:06:16.993,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to live in a greener tomorrow.

138
0:06:19.581,000 --> 0:06:21,000
We live in a big, diverse and beautiful world,

139
0:06:22.18,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and that makes me even more passionate to save it.

140
0:06:24.636,000 --> 0:06:26,000
But it's never enough to just to get it through your heads

141
0:06:27.014,000 --> 0:06:29,000
about the things that are happening in our world.

142
0:06:29.196,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It takes to get it through your hearts,

143
0:06:31.496,000 --> 0:06:32,000
because when you get it through your heart,

144
0:06:33.104,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that is when movements are sparked.

145
0:06:35.275,000 --> 0:06:36,000
That is when opportunities

146
0:06:36.574,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and innovation are created,

147
0:06:38.246,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and that is why ideas come to life.

148
0:06:41.279,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Thank you, and peace and blessings.

149
0:06:46.312,000 --> 0:06:51,000
(Applause)

150
0:06:51.944,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Thank you. (Applause)

151
0:06:54.715,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Pat Mitchell: So, you heard Maya talk about

152
0:06:58.015,000 --> 0:07:,000
the amazing parents who are behind

153
0:07:00.838,000 --> 0:07:02,000
this incredible woman. Where are they?

154
0:07:03.055,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Penn. Would you just -- Ah!

155
0:07:06.053,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Applause)

[The must-watch TED Talks of 2016]

2
0:00:04.351,000 --> 0:00:06,000
[Sam Harris: Can we build AI without losing control over it?]

3
0:00:06.89,000 --> 0:00:07,000
At a certain point,

4
0:00:08.265,000 --> 0:00:1,000
we will build machines that are smarter than we are.

5
0:00:10.641,000 --> 0:00:11,000
And once we have machines that are smarter than we are,

6
0:00:12.589,000 --> 0:00:13,000
they will begin to improve themselves.

7
0:00:14.32,000 --> 0:00:16,000
We're in the process of building some sort of god.

8
0:00:16.999,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Now would be a good time to make sure it's a god we can live with.

9
0:00:21.07,000 --> 0:00:22,000
[Jennifer Kahn: Gene editing can wipe out mosquitoes forever]

10
0:00:22.352,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Gene drives have risks, and those need to be discussed.

11
0:00:25.187,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But malaria exists now and kills 1,000 people a day.

12
0:00:29.09,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Remember that.

13
0:00:30.632,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It can be frightening to act, but sometimes, not acting is worse.

14
0:00:35.54,000 --> 0:00:37,000
[Jamila Raqib: The secret to effective nonviolent resistance]

15
0:00:37.883,000 --> 0:00:38,000
We're not going to end war

16
0:00:39.322,000 --> 0:00:41,000
by telling people that violence is morally wrong.

17
0:00:42.052,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Instead, we must offer them a tool

18
0:00:44.049,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that's at least as powerful and as effective as violence.

19
0:00:47.915,000 --> 0:00:48,000
[Alexander Betts: Here's how we can fix the refugee system]

20
0:00:49.808,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Rather than seeing refugees

21
0:00:51.14,000 --> 0:00:53,000
as inevitably dependent upon humanitarian assistance,

22
0:00:54.424,000 --> 0:00:57,000
we need to provide them with opportunities for human flourishing.

23
0:00:58.455,000 --> 0:01:,000
[Adam Foss: A prosecutor's vision for justice]

24
0:01:00.531,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Every day, thousands of times a day,

25
0:01:02.419,000 --> 0:01:04,000
prosecutors around the United States wield power so great

26
0:01:05.262,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that it can bring about catastrophe

27
0:01:06.787,000 --> 0:01:1,000
as quickly as it can bring about opportunity, intervention, support

28
0:01:12.06,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and yes, even love.

29
0:01:15.465,000 --> 0:01:16,000
[Dalia Mogahed: What do you think when you look at me?]

30
0:01:17.493,000 --> 0:01:21,000
What will you choose at this time of fear and bigotry?

31
0:01:22.754,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Will you play it safe?

32
0:01:25.252,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Or will you join those who say, "We are better than that?"

33
0:01:30.378,000 --> 0:01:31,000
[Tim Urban: Inside the mind of a procrastinator]

34
0:01:31.605,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them,

35
0:01:34.014,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.

36
0:01:38.523,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator?

37
0:01:40.132,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Well, it means everything's fine, until this happens.

38
0:01:43.981,000 --> 0:01:45,000
[Allan Adams: The discovery of gravitational waves]

39
0:01:46.104,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Two black holes, the densest thing in the universe,

40
0:01:49.133,000 --> 0:01:53,000
one with a mass of 29 Suns and one with a mass of 36 Suns,

41
0:01:54.181,000 --> 0:01:57,000
whirling around each other 100 times per second before they collide.

42
0:01:57.947,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And we know it because we heard it.

43
0:02:00.661,000 --> 0:02:02,000
[Kenneth Lacovara: Hunting for dinosaurs showed me our place in the universe]

44
0:02:03.488,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Why study the ancient past? Because it gives us perspective.

45
0:02:07.122,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The dinosaurs died in the world's fifth mass extinction,

46
0:02:10.316,000 --> 0:02:13,000
snuffed out in a cosmic accident through no fault of their own.

47
0:02:14.173,000 --> 0:02:15,000
They didn't have a choice.

48
0:02:15.718,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We, on the other hand, do have a choice.

49
0:02:19.765,000 --> 0:02:21,000
[Camille A. Brown: The visual history of social dance]

50
0:02:22.213,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Why do we dance?

51
0:02:23.689,000 --> 0:02:26,000
To move, to let loose, to express.

52
0:02:27.483,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Why do we dance together?

53
0:02:29.338,000 --> 0:02:3,000
To heal, to remember,

54
0:02:31.555,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to say: "We speak a common language.

55
0:02:34.236,000 --> 0:02:36,000
We exist, and we are free."

56
0:02:37.375,000 --> 0:02:42,000

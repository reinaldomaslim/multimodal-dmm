1
0:00:12.659,000 --> 0:00:13,000
This is the Hogeweyk.

2
0:00:14.984,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It's a neighborhood in a small town very near Amsterdam, in the Netherlands.

3
0:00:19.881,000 --> 0:00:22,000
There are 27 houses for six, seven people each.

4
0:00:23.821,000 --> 0:00:27,000
There's a small mall with a restaurant, a pub, a supermarket, a club room.

5
0:00:28.9,000 --> 0:00:32,000
There are streets, alleys, there's a theater.

6
0:00:34.434,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It actually is a nursing home.

7
0:00:37.093,000 --> 0:00:42,000
A nursing home for people that live with an advanced dementia

8
0:00:42.751,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and that need 24-7 care and support.

9
0:00:47.234,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Dementia is a terrible disease,

10
0:00:50.521,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and we still don't have any cure for it.

11
0:00:54.211,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It's getting to be a major problem in the world,

12
0:00:57.862,000 --> 0:00:58,000
for the people, for the politicians,

13
0:00:59.734,000 --> 0:01:01,000
for the world -- it's getting to be a big problem.

14
0:01:03.228,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We see that we have waiting lists in the nursing homes.

15
0:01:07.093,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Most people that come to the nursing homes with dementia are women.

16
0:01:11.855,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And that's also because women are used to taking care of people,

17
0:01:16.839,000 --> 0:01:19,000
so they can manage to take care of their husband with dementia,

18
0:01:20.716,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but the other way around is not so easy for the gentlemen.

19
0:01:26.629,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Dementia is a disease that affects the brain.

20
0:01:30.986,000 --> 0:01:32,000
The brain is confused.

21
0:01:33.923,000 --> 0:01:35,000
People don't know anymore what the time is,

22
0:01:36.708,000 --> 0:01:38,000
what's going on, who people are.

23
0:01:39.47,000 --> 0:01:4,000
They're very confused.

24
0:01:40.966,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And because of that confusion,

25
0:01:43.204,000 --> 0:01:49,000
they get to be anxious, depressed, aggressive.

26
0:01:50.728,000 --> 0:01:52,000
This is a traditional nursing home.

27
0:01:53.133,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I worked there in 1992.

28
0:01:55.641,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I was a care manager.

29
0:01:57.687,000 --> 0:02:,000
And we often spoke together about the fact

30
0:02:00.727,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that what we were doing there was not what we wanted for our parents,

31
0:02:05.752,000 --> 0:02:08,000
for our friends, for ourselves.

32
0:02:09.815,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And one day, we said,

33
0:02:11.624,000 --> 0:02:13,000
"When we keep on saying this, nothing is going to change.

34
0:02:14.402,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We are in charge here.

35
0:02:15.799,000 --> 0:02:17,000
We should do something about this,

36
0:02:18.319,000 --> 0:02:21,000
so that we do want to have our parents here."

37
0:02:22.773,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We talked about that, and what we saw every day

38
0:02:25.805,000 --> 0:02:28,000
was that the people that lived in our nursing home

39
0:02:29.522,000 --> 0:02:31,000
were confused about their environment,

40
0:02:31.911,000 --> 0:02:34,000
because what they saw was a hospital-like environment,

41
0:02:35.482,000 --> 0:02:39,000
with doctors and nurses and paramedics in uniform,

42
0:02:39.617,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and they lived on a ward.

43
0:02:42.069,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And they didn't understand why they lived there.

44
0:02:44.927,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And they looked for the place to get away.

45
0:02:48.617,000 --> 0:02:52,000
They looked and hoped to find the door to go home again.

46
0:02:54.022,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And we said what we are doing in this situation

47
0:02:57.871,000 --> 0:03:02,000
is offering these people that already have a confused brain

48
0:03:02.934,000 --> 0:03:03,000
some more confusion.

49
0:03:04.244,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We were adding confusion to confusion.

50
0:03:08.18,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And that was not what these people needed.

51
0:03:11.084,000 --> 0:03:13,000
These people wanted to have a life,

52
0:03:13.87,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and the help, our help, to deal with that dementia.

53
0:03:17.957,000 --> 0:03:21,000
These people wanted to live in a normal house,

54
0:03:22.713,000 --> 0:03:23,000
not in a ward.

55
0:03:24.482,000 --> 0:03:26,000
They wanted to have a normal household,

56
0:03:27.331,000 --> 0:03:31,000
where they would smell their dinner on the stove in the kitchen.

57
0:03:32.966,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Or be free to go to the kitchen and grab something to eat or drink.

58
0:03:37.611,000 --> 0:03:39,000
That's what these people needed.

59
0:03:39.865,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And that's what we should organize for them.

60
0:03:43.269,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And we said we should organize this like at home,

61
0:03:48.014,000 --> 0:03:52,000
so they wouldn't live with a group of 15 or 20 or 30, like in a ward.

62
0:03:53.434,000 --> 0:03:57,000
No, a small group of people, six or seven, family-like.

63
0:03:59.069,000 --> 0:04:,000
Like living with friends.

64
0:04:02.709,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And we should find a way to select people

65
0:04:05.812,000 --> 0:04:07,000
based on their ideas about life

66
0:04:08.59,000 --> 0:04:11,000
so that they did have a good chance to become friends,

67
0:04:11.714,000 --> 0:04:12,000
when they lived together.

68
0:04:14.225,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And we interviewed all the families of the residents

69
0:04:18.409,000 --> 0:04:21,000
about "what is important for your father," "what's important for your mother,"

70
0:04:22.126,000 --> 0:04:24,000
"what is their life like," "what do they want."

71
0:04:24.899,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And we found seven groups, and we call them lifestyle groups.

72
0:04:29.709,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And for instance, we found this formal lifestyle.

73
0:04:33.851,000 --> 0:04:34,000
In this lifestyle,

74
0:04:35.101,000 --> 0:04:38,000
people have a more formal way of interacting with each other,

75
0:04:38.546,000 --> 0:04:39,000
a distant way.

76
0:04:39.863,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Their daily rhythm starts later in the day,

77
0:04:42.133,000 --> 0:04:43,000
ends later in the day.

78
0:04:43.879,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Classical music is more heard in this lifestyle group

79
0:04:46.929,000 --> 0:04:47,000
than in other lifestyle groups.

80
0:04:48.656,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And their menu,

81
0:04:50.164,000 --> 0:04:53,000
well, is more French cuisine than traditional Dutch.

82
0:04:53.967,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:55.583,000 --> 0:04:58,000
In contrary to the craftsman lifestyle.

84
0:04:59.218,000 --> 0:05:01,000
That's a very traditional lifestyle,

85
0:05:01.385,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and they get up early in the morning, go to bed early,

86
0:05:03.979,000 --> 0:05:07,000
because they have worked hard their whole life, mostly with their hands,

87
0:05:08.005,000 --> 0:05:12,000
very often had a very small family business, a small farm, a shop,

88
0:05:12.632,000 --> 0:05:16,000
or like Mr. B, he was a farmhand.

89
0:05:17.466,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And he told me that he would go to his work every morning

90
0:05:20.99,000 --> 0:05:22,000
with a paper bag with his lunch

91
0:05:24.014,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and one cigar.

92
0:05:26.824,000 --> 0:05:3,000
That one cigar was the only luxury he could afford for himself.

93
0:05:31.42,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And after lunch, he would have that one cigar.

94
0:05:35.46,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And until the day he died in the Hogeweyk,

95
0:05:38.812,000 --> 0:05:43,000
he was in this little shed, every day, after lunch, to smoke his cigar.

96
0:05:47.201,000 --> 0:05:48,000
This is my mother.

97
0:05:48.411,000 --> 0:05:49,000
She's of the cultural lifestyle,

98
0:05:50.046,000 --> 0:05:52,000
she's been living in the Hogeweyk six weeks now.

99
0:05:53.236,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And that lifestyle is about traveling, meeting other people, other cultures,

100
0:05:58.5,000 --> 0:06:01,000
interest in arts and music.

101
0:06:02.072,000 --> 0:06:03,000
There are more lifestyles.

102
0:06:04.818,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But that's what we talked about, and that's what we did.

103
0:06:09.766,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But that's not life in a house with a group of people,

104
0:06:14.641,000 --> 0:06:17,000
like-minded people, your own life, your own household.

105
0:06:18.434,000 --> 0:06:19,000
There's more in life,

106
0:06:19.787,000 --> 0:06:22,000
everybody wants fun in life and a meaningful life.

107
0:06:23.688,000 --> 0:06:24,000
We are social animals --

108
0:06:25.133,000 --> 0:06:27,000
we need a social life.

109
0:06:27.817,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And that's what we started.

110
0:06:30.817,000 --> 0:06:33,000
We want to go out of our house and do some shopping,

111
0:06:34.317,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and meet other people.

112
0:06:36.698,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Or go to the pub, have a beer with friends.

113
0:06:40.462,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Or like Mr. W -- he likes to go out every day,

114
0:06:45.468,000 --> 0:06:47,000
see if there are nice ladies around.

115
0:06:48.108,000 --> 0:06:49,000
(Laughter)

116
0:06:50.465,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And he's very courteous to them,

117
0:06:52.044,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and he hopes for smiles and he gets them.

118
0:06:54.863,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And he dances with them in the pub.

119
0:06:58.014,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It's a feast every day.

120
0:06:59.554,000 --> 0:07:02,000
There are people that would rather go to the restaurant,

121
0:07:02.792,000 --> 0:07:03,000
have a wine with friends,

122
0:07:04.49,000 --> 0:07:07,000
or lunch or dinner with friends and celebrate life.

123
0:07:08.18,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And my mother, she takes a walk in the park,

124
0:07:10.99,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and sits on a bench in the sun,

125
0:07:12.697,000 --> 0:07:15,000
hoping that a passerby will come and sit next to her

126
0:07:15.847,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and have a conversation about life

127
0:07:18.434,000 --> 0:07:21,000
or about the ducks in the pond.

128
0:07:22.355,000 --> 0:07:24,000
That social life is important.

129
0:07:24.998,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It means that you're part of society, that you belong.

130
0:07:29.974,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And that's what we people need.

131
0:07:33.013,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Even if you're living with advanced dementia.

132
0:07:37.482,000 --> 0:07:39,000
This is what I see from my office window.

133
0:07:40.371,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And one day, I saw a lady coming from one side,

134
0:07:44.604,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and the other lady from the other side, and they met at the corner.

135
0:07:48.247,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And I knew both ladies very well.

136
0:07:50.929,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I often saw them walking around outside.

137
0:07:54.618,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And now and then, I tried to have a conversation with them,

138
0:07:59.023,000 --> 0:08:01,000
but their conversation was ...

139
0:08:02.586,000 --> 0:08:04,000
rather hard to understand.

140
0:08:05.839,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But I saw them meeting, and I saw them talking,

141
0:08:09.522,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and I saw them gesturing.

142
0:08:11.426,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And they had fun together.

143
0:08:13.554,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And then they said goodbye, and each went their own way.

144
0:08:17.331,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And that's what you want in life, meeting other people

145
0:08:20.593,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and being part of society.

146
0:08:23.093,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And that's what I saw happening.

147
0:08:26.148,000 --> 0:08:28,000
The Hogeweyk has become a place

148
0:08:28.179,000 --> 0:08:31,000
where people with very advanced dementia can live,

149
0:08:31.885,000 --> 0:08:32,000
have freedom and safety,

150
0:08:33.845,000 --> 0:08:37,000
because the professionals working there and the volunteers working there

151
0:08:38.353,000 --> 0:08:4,000
know how to deal with dementia.

152
0:08:41.093,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And the professionals know how to do their professional work

153
0:08:44.45,000 --> 0:08:49,000
in a way that it fits in a natural way in the life of our residents.

154
0:08:50.826,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And that means that the management has to provide everything

155
0:08:55.53,000 --> 0:08:57,000
those people need to do their work.

156
0:08:58.866,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It needs a management that dares to do this.

157
0:09:02.734,000 --> 0:09:05,000
To do things differently than we always have done

158
0:09:05.895,000 --> 0:09:07,000
in a traditional nursing home.

159
0:09:10.989,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We see that it works.

160
0:09:14.006,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We think this can be done everywhere,

161
0:09:17.196,000 --> 0:09:19,000
because this is not for the rich.

162
0:09:19.863,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We've been doing this with the same budget

163
0:09:24.236,000 --> 0:09:28,000
as any traditional nursing home has in our country.

164
0:09:28.339,000 --> 0:09:3,000
We work only with the state budget.

165
0:09:32.22,000 --> 0:09:38,000
(Applause)

166
0:09:40.226,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Because it has to do with thinking different,

167
0:09:43.822,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and looking at the person in front of you

168
0:09:46.576,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and looking at what does this person need now.

169
0:09:51.352,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And it's about a smile, it's about thinking different,

170
0:09:54.616,000 --> 0:09:58,000
it's about how you act, and that costs nothing.

171
0:09:59.823,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And there's something else: it's about making choices.

172
0:10:03.903,000 --> 0:10:06,000
It's about making choices what you spend your money on.

173
0:10:08.855,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I always say,

174
0:10:11.323,000 --> 0:10:15,000
"Red curtains are as expensive as gray ones."

175
0:10:16.093,000 --> 0:10:17,000
(Laughter)

176
0:10:17.494,000 --> 0:10:19,000
It's possible, everywhere.

177
0:10:21.263,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Thank you.

178
0:10:22.446,000 --> 0:10:26,000
(Applause)

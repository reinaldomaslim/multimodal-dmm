1
0:00:12.536,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So I wanted to tell a story

2
0:00:13.819,000 --> 0:00:16,000
that really obsessed me when I was writing my new book,

3
0:00:17.291,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and it's a story of something that happened

4
0:00:20.838,000 --> 0:00:21,000
3,000 years ago,

5
0:00:22.411,000 --> 0:00:25,000
when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy.

6
0:00:25.638,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And it takes place in an area called the Shephelah

7
0:00:28.37,000 --> 0:00:3,000
in what is now Israel.

8
0:00:30.7,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And the reason the story obsessed me is that

9
0:00:32.948,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I thought I understood it, and then I went back over it

10
0:00:36.034,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and I realized that I didn't understand it at all.

11
0:00:40.14,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Ancient Palestine had a -- along its eastern border,

12
0:00:44.957,000 --> 0:00:45,000
there's a mountain range.

13
0:00:46.273,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Still same is true of Israel today.

14
0:00:48.132,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities

15
0:00:51.065,000 --> 0:00:55,000
of that region, so Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron.

16
0:00:55.523,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And then there's a coastal plain

17
0:00:57.748,000 --> 0:01:,000
along the Mediterranean, where Tel Aviv is now.

18
0:01:01.103,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain

19
0:01:04.503,000 --> 0:01:05,000
is an area called the Shephelah,

20
0:01:06.436,000 --> 0:01:1,000
which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west,

21
0:01:10.855,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and you can follow the Shephelah, go through the Shephelah

22
0:01:14.034,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to get from the coastal plain to the mountains.

23
0:01:16.787,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And the Shephelah, if you've been to Israel, you'll know

24
0:01:18.481,000 --> 0:01:2,000
it's just about the most beautiful part of Israel.

25
0:01:20.889,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It's gorgeous, with forests of oak

26
0:01:23.807,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and wheat fields and vineyards.

27
0:01:26.222,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But more importantly, though, in the history of that region,

28
0:01:29.601,000 --> 0:01:32,000
it's served, it's had a real strategic function,

29
0:01:33.366,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and that is, it is the means by which hostile armies

30
0:01:36.279,000 --> 0:01:38,000
on the coastal plain find their way,

31
0:01:38.862,000 --> 0:01:41,000
get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains.

32
0:01:42.484,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And 3,000 years ago, that's exactly what happens.

33
0:01:45.511,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The Philistines, who are the biggest of enemies

34
0:01:49.788,000 --> 0:01:5,000
of the Kingdom of Israel,

35
0:01:51.29,000 --> 0:01:52,000
are living in the coastal plain.

36
0:01:53.002,000 --> 0:01:56,000
They're originally from Crete. They're a seafaring people.

37
0:01:56.298,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And they may start to make their way

38
0:01:58.721,000 --> 0:02:,000
through one of the valleys of the Shephelah

39
0:02:00.961,000 --> 0:02:01,000
up into the mountains,

40
0:02:02.128,000 --> 0:02:04,000
because what they want to do is occupy the highland area

41
0:02:04.384,000 --> 0:02:08,000
right by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two.

42
0:02:08.385,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And the Kingdom of Israel, which is headed by King Saul,

43
0:02:11.65,000 --> 0:02:12,000
obviously catches wind of this,

44
0:02:13.383,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and Saul brings his army down from the mountains

45
0:02:16.252,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah,

46
0:02:19.907,000 --> 0:02:21,000
one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah.

47
0:02:22.365,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge,

48
0:02:25.233,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge,

49
0:02:29.49,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and the two armies just sit there for weeks

50
0:02:32.225,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and stare at each other, because they're deadlocked.

51
0:02:34.347,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Neither can attack the other, because to attack the other side

52
0:02:36.82,000 --> 0:02:39,000
you've got to come down the mountain into the valley

53
0:02:40.076,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and then up the other side, and you're completely exposed.

54
0:02:42.593,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So finally, to break the deadlock,

55
0:02:44.785,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the Philistines send their mightiest warrior

56
0:02:47.999,000 --> 0:02:49,000
down into the valley floor, and he calls out

57
0:02:50.476,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and he says to the Israelites,

58
0:02:51.932,000 --> 0:02:53,000
"Send your mightiest warrior down,

59
0:02:54.56,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and we'll have this out, just the two of us."

60
0:02:56.567,000 --> 0:02:59,000
This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat.

61
0:03:00.402,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It was a way of settling disputes

62
0:03:02.197,000 --> 0:03:06,000
without incurring the bloodshed of a major battle.

63
0:03:06.321,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And the Philistine who is sent down,

64
0:03:09.281,000 --> 0:03:11,000
their mighty warrior, is a giant.

65
0:03:11.448,000 --> 0:03:12,000
He's 6 foot 9.

66
0:03:13.223,000 --> 0:03:17,000
He's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor,

67
0:03:17.936,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and he's got a sword and he's got a javelin

68
0:03:20.995,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and he's got his spear. He is absolutely terrifying.

69
0:03:23.723,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And he's so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him.

70
0:03:28.213,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It's a death wish, right? There's no way they think they can take him.

71
0:03:32.848,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And finally the only person who will come forward

72
0:03:35.141,000 --> 0:03:37,000
is this young shepherd boy,

73
0:03:37.652,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and he goes up to Saul and he says, "I'll fight him."

74
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And Saul says, "You can't fight him. That's ridiculous.

75
0:03:43.448,000 --> 0:03:45,000
You're this kid. This is this mighty warrior."

76
0:03:45.77,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But the shepherd is adamant. He says, "No, no, no,

77
0:03:48.193,000 --> 0:03:5,000
you don't understand, I have been defending my flock

78
0:03:51.186,000 --> 0:03:55,000
against lions and wolves for years. I think I can do it."

79
0:03:55.355,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And Saul has no choice. He's got no one else who's come forward.

80
0:03:58.569,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So he says, "All right."

81
0:03:59.91,000 --> 0:04:,000
And then he turns to the kid, and he says,

82
0:04:01.122,000 --> 0:04:04,000
"But you've got to wear this armor. You can't go as you are."

83
0:04:04.816,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So he tries to give the shepherd his armor,

84
0:04:07.219,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and the shepherd says, "No."

85
0:04:08.47,000 --> 0:04:1,000
He says, "I can't wear this stuff."

86
0:04:10.883,000 --> 0:04:14,000
The Biblical verse is, "I cannot wear this for I have not proved it,"

87
0:04:14.957,000 --> 0:04:17,000
meaning, "I've never worn armor before. You've got to be crazy."

88
0:04:18.134,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So he reaches down instead on the ground

89
0:04:20.74,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and picks up five stones

90
0:04:22.495,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and puts them in his shepherd's bag

91
0:04:24.956,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant.

92
0:04:29.468,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And the giant sees this figure approaching,

93
0:04:31.674,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and calls out, "Come to me so I can feed your flesh

94
0:04:34.817,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field."

95
0:04:38.794,000 --> 0:04:41,000
He issues this kind of taunt towards this person

96
0:04:42.229,000 --> 0:04:43,000
coming to fight him.

97
0:04:43.964,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And the shepherd draws closer and closer,

98
0:04:47.31,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and the giant sees that he's carrying a staff.

99
0:04:50.298,000 --> 0:04:51,000
That's all he's carrying.

100
0:04:51.47,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Instead of a weapon, just this shepherd's staff,

101
0:04:53.338,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and he says -- he's insulted --

102
0:04:55.91,000 --> 0:04:58,000
"Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks?"

103
0:04:59.267,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And the shepherd boy takes one of his stones

104
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
out of his pocket, puts it in his sling

105
0:05:05.57,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and rolls it around and lets it fly

106
0:05:07.865,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and it hits the giant right between the eyes --

107
0:05:10.266,000 --> 0:05:12,000
right here, in his most vulnerable spot --

108
0:05:12.364,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and he falls down either dead or unconscious,

109
0:05:15.685,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword

110
0:05:18.179,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and cuts off his head,

111
0:05:19.865,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and the Philistines see this and they turn and they just run.

112
0:05:25.416,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And of course, the name of the giant is Goliath

113
0:05:29.777,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and the name of the shepherd boy is David,

114
0:05:32.306,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and the reason that story has obsessed me

115
0:05:35.436,000 --> 0:05:36,000
over the course of writing my book

116
0:05:36.874,000 --> 0:05:39,000
is that everything I thought I knew about that story

117
0:05:39.966,000 --> 0:05:41,000
turned out to be wrong.

118
0:05:42.717,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So David, in that story, is supposed to be the underdog, right?

119
0:05:46.505,000 --> 0:05:48,000
In fact, that term, David and Goliath,

120
0:05:48.642,000 --> 0:05:5,000
has entered our language as a metaphor for

121
0:05:51.623,000 --> 0:05:52,000
improbable victories

122
0:05:53.161,000 --> 0:05:56,000
by some weak party over someone far stronger.

123
0:05:56.272,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Now why do we call David an underdog?

124
0:05:58.462,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Well, we call him an underdog because he's a kid,

125
0:06:01.937,000 --> 0:06:04,000
a little kid, and Goliath is this big, strong giant.

126
0:06:05.473,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We also call him an underdog

127
0:06:07.128,000 --> 0:06:1,000
because Goliath is an experienced warrior,

128
0:06:11.05,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and David is just a shepherd.

129
0:06:12.986,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But most importantly, we call him an underdog

130
0:06:15.336,000 --> 0:06:2,000
because all he has is -- it's that Goliath is outfitted with

131
0:06:20.346,000 --> 0:06:22,000
all of this modern weaponry,

132
0:06:22.351,000 --> 0:06:23,000
this glittering coat of armor

133
0:06:24.127,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and a sword and a javelin and a spear,

134
0:06:27.962,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and all David has is this sling.

135
0:06:31.792,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Well, let's start there with the phrase

136
0:06:33.49,000 --> 0:06:35,000
"All David has is this sling,"

137
0:06:35.934,000 --> 0:06:37,000
because that's the first mistake that we make.

138
0:06:38.801,000 --> 0:06:41,000
In ancient warfare, there are three kinds of warriors.

139
0:06:42.358,000 --> 0:06:45,000
There's cavalry, men on horseback and with chariots.

140
0:06:45.789,000 --> 0:06:48,000
There's heavy infantry, which are foot soldiers,

141
0:06:48.915,000 --> 0:06:5,000
armed foot soldiers with swords and shields

142
0:06:51.805,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and some kind of armor.

143
0:06:53.305,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And there's artillery, and artillery are archers,

144
0:06:56.533,000 --> 0:06:58,000
but, more importantly, slingers.

145
0:06:58.705,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch

146
0:07:01.766,000 --> 0:07:03,000
with two long cords attached to it,

147
0:07:04.563,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and they put a projectile, either a rock or a lead ball,

148
0:07:07.765,000 --> 0:07:1,000
inside the pouch, and they whirl it around like this

149
0:07:10.886,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and they let one of the cords go,

150
0:07:13.529,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and the effect is to send the projectile forward

151
0:07:17.399,000 --> 0:07:2,000
towards its target.

152
0:07:20.704,000 --> 0:07:22,000
That's what David has, and it's important to understand

153
0:07:23.439,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that that sling is not a slingshot.

154
0:07:26.286,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It's not this, right? It's not a child's toy.

155
0:07:28.905,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon.

156
0:07:32.73,000 --> 0:07:34,000
When David rolls it around like this,

157
0:07:35.706,000 --> 0:07:38,000
he's turning the sling around probably

158
0:07:38.935,000 --> 0:07:4,000
at six or seven revolutions per second,

159
0:07:41.607,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and that means that when the rock is released,

160
0:07:45.452,000 --> 0:07:47,000
it's going forward really fast,

161
0:07:47.652,000 --> 0:07:48,000
probably 35 meters per second.

162
0:07:49.425,000 --> 0:07:52,000
That's substantially faster than a baseball

163
0:07:52.99,000 --> 0:07:55,000
thrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers.

164
0:07:56.623,000 --> 0:07:59,000
More than that, the stones in the Valley of Elah

165
0:08:00.506,000 --> 0:08:02,000
were not normal rocks. They were barium sulphate,

166
0:08:03.162,000 --> 0:08:06,000
which are rocks twice the density of normal stones.

167
0:08:06.481,000 --> 0:08:08,000
If you do the calculations on the ballistics,

168
0:08:09.118,000 --> 0:08:12,000
on the stopping power of the rock fired from David's sling,

169
0:08:13.002,000 --> 0:08:15,000
it's roughly equal to the stopping power

170
0:08:15.323,000 --> 0:08:18,000
of a [.45 caliber] handgun.

171
0:08:18.88,000 --> 0:08:2,000
This is an incredibly devastating weapon.

172
0:08:21.874,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Accuracy, we know from historical records

173
0:08:26.472,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that slingers -- experienced slingers could hit

174
0:08:30.97,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and maim or even kill a target at distances of up to 200 yards.

175
0:08:36.993,000 --> 0:08:38,000
From medieval tapestries, we know that slingers

176
0:08:39.963,000 --> 0:08:41,000
were capable of hitting birds in flight.

177
0:08:42.321,000 --> 0:08:44,000
They were incredibly accurate.

178
0:08:44.755,000 --> 0:08:47,000
When David lines up -- and he's not 200 yards away from Goliath,

179
0:08:48.312,000 --> 0:08:49,000
he's quite close to Goliath --

180
0:08:49.921,000 --> 0:08:52,000
when he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath,

181
0:08:53.336,000 --> 0:08:56,000
he has every intention and every expectation

182
0:08:56.398,000 --> 0:08:58,000
of being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spot

183
0:08:59.101,000 --> 0:09:,000
between his eyes.

184
0:09:00.429,000 --> 0:09:02,000
If you go back over the history of ancient warfare,

185
0:09:02.445,000 --> 0:09:04,000
you will find time and time again

186
0:09:05.257,000 --> 0:09:09,000
that slingers were the decisive factor against infantry

187
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
in one kind of battle or another.

188
0:09:14.285,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So what's Goliath? He's heavy infantry,

189
0:09:18.181,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and his expectation when he challenges the Israelites to a duel

190
0:09:23.38,000 --> 0:09:26,000
is that he's going to be fighting another heavy infantryman.

191
0:09:27.235,000 --> 0:09:29,000
When he says, "Come to me that I might

192
0:09:29.406,000 --> 0:09:31,000
feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,"

193
0:09:32.358,000 --> 0:09:34,000
the key phrase is "Come to me."

194
0:09:34.358,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Come up to me because we're going to fight,

195
0:09:36.496,000 --> 0:09:37,000
hand to hand, like this.

196
0:09:38.207,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Saul has the same expectation.

197
0:09:40.335,000 --> 0:09:42,000
David says, "I want to fight Goliath,"

198
0:09:42.694,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and Saul tries to give him his armor,

199
0:09:44.515,000 --> 0:09:46,000
because Saul is thinking, "Oh, when you say 'fight Goliath,'

200
0:09:47.242,000 --> 0:09:5,000
you mean 'fight him in hand-to-hand combat,'

201
0:09:50.509,000 --> 0:09:52,000
infantry on infantry."

202
0:09:52.697,000 --> 0:09:54,000
But David has absolutely no expectation.

203
0:09:55.671,000 --> 0:09:57,000
He's not going to fight him that way. Why would he?

204
0:09:58.222,000 --> 0:10:01,000
He's a shepherd. He's spent his entire career

205
0:10:01.23,000 --> 0:10:05,000
using a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves.

206
0:10:05.443,000 --> 0:10:06,000
That's where his strength lies.

207
0:10:07.193,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So here he is, this shepherd, experienced

208
0:10:09.725,000 --> 0:10:11,000
in the use of a devastating weapon,

209
0:10:11.764,000 --> 0:10:13,000
up against this lumbering giant

210
0:10:14.158,000 --> 0:10:17,000
weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor

211
0:10:17.458,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and these incredibly heavy weapons

212
0:10:18.959,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that are useful only in short-range combat.

213
0:10:22.056,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Goliath is a sitting duck. He doesn't have a chance.

214
0:10:26.793,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So why do we keep calling David an underdog,

215
0:10:29.599,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable?

216
0:10:35.423,000 --> 0:10:37,000
There's a second piece of this that's important.

217
0:10:38.263,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It's not just that we misunderstand David

218
0:10:41.661,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and his choice of weaponry.

219
0:10:43.566,000 --> 0:10:46,000
It's also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath.

220
0:10:46.905,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Goliath is not what he seems to be.

221
0:10:50.139,000 --> 0:10:53,000
There's all kinds of hints of this in the Biblical text,

222
0:10:54.127,000 --> 0:10:56,000
things that are in retrospect quite puzzling

223
0:10:56.932,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and don't square with his image as this mighty warrior.

224
0:11:00.709,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So to begin with, the Bible says that Goliath

225
0:11:04.086,000 --> 0:11:07,000
is led onto the valley floor by an attendant.

226
0:11:08.051,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Now that is weird, right?

227
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Here is this mighty warrior

228
0:11:12.39,000 --> 0:11:14,000
challenging the Israelites to one-on-one combat.

229
0:11:15.197,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Why is he being led by the hand

230
0:11:17.909,000 --> 0:11:2,000
by some young boy, presumably,

231
0:11:20.959,000 --> 0:11:22,000
to the point of combat?

232
0:11:23.421,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Secondly, the Bible story makes special note

233
0:11:27.775,000 --> 0:11:3,000
of how slowly Goliath moves,

234
0:11:30.864,000 --> 0:11:32,000
another odd thing to say when you're describing

235
0:11:32.89,000 --> 0:11:36,000
the mightiest warrior known to man at that point.

236
0:11:36.94,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And then there's this whole weird thing

237
0:11:38.763,000 --> 0:11:41,000
about how long it takes Goliath to react

238
0:11:42.575,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to the sight of David.

239
0:11:44.571,000 --> 0:11:46,000
So David's coming down the mountain,

240
0:11:47.349,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and he's clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat.

241
0:11:51.286,000 --> 0:11:52,000
There is nothing about him that says,

242
0:11:53.254,000 --> 0:11:55,000
"I am about to fight you like this."

243
0:11:55.288,000 --> 0:11:56,000
He's not even carrying a sword.

244
0:11:57.019,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Why does Goliath not react to that?

245
0:11:59.701,000 --> 0:12:03,000
It's as if he's oblivious to what's going on that day.

246
0:12:03.929,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And then there's that strange comment he makes to David:

247
0:12:07.876,000 --> 0:12:11,000
"Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?"

248
0:12:12.171,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Sticks? David only has one stick.

249
0:12:15.994,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Well, it turns out that there's been a great deal

250
0:12:18.253,000 --> 0:12:21,000
of speculation within the medical community over the years

251
0:12:21.294,000 --> 0:12:23,000
about whether there is something

252
0:12:23.82,000 --> 0:12:25,000
fundamentally wrong with Goliath,

253
0:12:26.709,000 --> 0:12:29,000
an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies.

254
0:12:30.118,000 --> 0:12:31,000
There have been many articles written.

255
0:12:31.28,000 --> 0:12:34,000
The first one was in 1960 in the Indiana Medical Journal,

256
0:12:35.274,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and it started a chain of speculation

257
0:12:37.629,000 --> 0:12:4,000
that starts with an explanation for Goliath's height.

258
0:12:40.752,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So Goliath is head and shoulders above

259
0:12:43.675,000 --> 0:12:45,000
all of his peers in that era,

260
0:12:45.837,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and usually when someone is that far out of the norm,

261
0:12:49.819,000 --> 0:12:5,000
there's an explanation for it.

262
0:12:51.416,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So the most common form of giantism

263
0:12:54.649,000 --> 0:12:56,000
is a condition called acromegaly,

264
0:12:57.384,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor

265
0:13:00.287,000 --> 0:13:02,000
on your pituitary gland

266
0:13:02.79,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone.

267
0:13:05.506,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And throughout history, many of the most famous giants

268
0:13:09.065,000 --> 0:13:1,000
have all had acromegaly.

269
0:13:10.834,000 --> 0:13:12,000
So the tallest person of all time

270
0:13:12.898,000 --> 0:13:13,000
was a guy named Robert Wadlow

271
0:13:14.465,000 --> 0:13:17,000
who was still growing when he died at the age of 24

272
0:13:17.516,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and he was 8 foot 11.

273
0:13:20.405,000 --> 0:13:21,000
He had acromegaly.

274
0:13:21.819,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Do you remember the wrestler André the Giant?

275
0:13:24.354,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Famous. He had acromegaly.

276
0:13:26.037,000 --> 0:13:3,000
There's even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly.

277
0:13:30.576,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Anyone who's unusually tall,

278
0:13:31.654,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that's the first explanation we come up with.

279
0:13:34.407,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects

280
0:13:38.402,000 --> 0:13:39,000
associated with it,

281
0:13:39.627,000 --> 0:13:42,000
principally having to do with vision.

282
0:13:43.189,000 --> 0:13:46,000
The pituitary tumor, as it grows,

283
0:13:46.485,000 --> 0:13:5,000
often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain,

284
0:13:50.533,000 --> 0:13:52,000
with the result that people with acromegaly

285
0:13:53.037,000 --> 0:13:58,000
have either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted.

286
0:13:58.508,000 --> 0:14:,000
So when people have started to speculate

287
0:14:01.101,000 --> 0:14:04,000
about what might have been wrong with Goliath,

288
0:14:04.332,000 --> 0:14:04,000
they've said, "Wait a minute,

289
0:14:05.243,000 --> 0:14:08,000
he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone

290
0:14:08.433,000 --> 0:14:09,000
who has acromegaly."

291
0:14:10.006,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And that would also explain so much of what was strange

292
0:14:12.99,000 --> 0:14:14,000
about his behavior that day.

293
0:14:15.117,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Why does he move so slowly

294
0:14:16.938,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and have to be escorted down into the valley floor

295
0:14:20.466,000 --> 0:14:21,000
by an attendant?

296
0:14:21.825,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Because he can't make his way on his own.

297
0:14:24.813,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Why is he so strangely oblivious to David

298
0:14:28.07,000 --> 0:14:3,000
that he doesn't understand that David's not going to fight him

299
0:14:30.719,000 --> 0:14:32,000
until the very last moment?

300
0:14:32.866,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Because he can't see him.

301
0:14:35.375,000 --> 0:14:38,000
When he says, "Come to me that I might feed your flesh

302
0:14:38.692,000 --> 0:14:4,000
to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,"

303
0:14:41.188,000 --> 0:14:45,000
the phrase "come to me" is a hint also of his vulnerability.

304
0:14:45.832,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Come to me because I can't see you.

305
0:14:48.816,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And then there's, "Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?"

306
0:14:54.03,000 --> 0:14:59,000
He sees two sticks when David has only one.

307
0:14:59.36,000 --> 0:15:01,000
So the Israelites up on the mountain ridge

308
0:15:02.324,000 --> 0:15:04,000
looking down on him thought he was

309
0:15:04.521,000 --> 0:15:07,000
this extraordinarily powerful foe.

310
0:15:07.632,000 --> 0:15:08,000
What they didn't understand was that

311
0:15:09.608,000 --> 0:15:12,000
the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength

312
0:15:12.905,000 --> 0:15:15,000
was also the source of his greatest weakness.

313
0:15:16.66,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And there is, I think, in that,

314
0:15:18.617,000 --> 0:15:21,000
a very important lesson for all of us.

315
0:15:21.822,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem.

316
0:15:25.684,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket.

317
0:15:29.173,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Thank you.

318
0:15:30.96,000 --> 0:15:34,000
(Applause)

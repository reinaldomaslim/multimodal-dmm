1
0:00:13.507,000 --> 0:00:14,000
In 2003,

2
0:00:15.42,000 --> 0:00:17,000
when we sequenced the human genome,

3
0:00:18.357,000 --> 0:00:21,000
we thought we would have the answer to treat many diseases.

4
0:00:22.974,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But the reality is far from that,

5
0:00:26.782,000 --> 0:00:27,000
because in addition to our genes,

6
0:00:28.727,000 --> 0:00:32,000
our environment and lifestyle could have a significant role

7
0:00:33.321,000 --> 0:00:35,000
in developing many major diseases.

8
0:00:35.893,000 --> 0:00:38,000
One example is fatty liver disease,

9
0:00:39.497,000 --> 0:00:43,000
which is affecting over 20 percent of the population globally,

10
0:00:43.604,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and it has no treatment and leads to liver cancer

11
0:00:46.662,000 --> 0:00:47,000
or liver failure.

12
0:00:49.517,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So sequencing DNA alone doesn't give us enough information

13
0:00:54.285,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to find effective therapeutics.

14
0:00:56.541,000 --> 0:00:59,000
On the bright side, there are many other molecules in our body.

15
0:01:00.321,000 --> 0:01:03,000
In fact, there are over 100,000 metabolites.

16
0:01:04.325,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Metabolites are any molecule that is supersmall in their size.

17
0:01:09.193,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Known examples are glucose, fructose, fats, cholesterol --

18
0:01:14.189,000 --> 0:01:15,000
things we hear all the time.

19
0:01:16.273,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Metabolites are involved in our metabolism.

20
0:01:20.066,000 --> 0:01:24,000
They are also downstream of DNA,

21
0:01:24.118,000 --> 0:01:29,000
so they carry information from both our genes as well as lifestyle.

22
0:01:29.224,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Understanding metabolites is essential to find treatments for many diseases.

23
0:01:34.897,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I've always wanted to treat patients.

24
0:01:37.934,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Despite that, 15 years ago, I left medical school,

25
0:01:41.816,000 --> 0:01:42,000
as I missed mathematics.

26
0:01:45.019,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Soon after, I found the coolest thing:

27
0:01:48.692,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I can use mathematics to study medicine.

28
0:01:53.026,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Since then, I've been developing algorithms to analyze biological data.

29
0:01:59.092,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So, it sounded easy:

30
0:02:01.399,000 --> 0:02:04,000
let's collect data from all the metabolites in our body,

31
0:02:05.024,000 --> 0:02:1,000
develop mathematical models to describe how they are changed in a disease

32
0:02:10.176,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and intervene in those changes to treat them.

33
0:02:14.488,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Then I realized why no one has done this before:

34
0:02:19.23,000 --> 0:02:2,000
it's extremely difficult.

35
0:02:20.941,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:22.052,000 --> 0:02:24,000
There are many metabolites in our body.

37
0:02:24.783,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Each one is different from the other one.

38
0:02:27.307,000 --> 0:02:3,000
For some metabolites, we can measure their molecular mass

39
0:02:31.059,000 --> 0:02:33,000
using mass spectrometry instruments.

40
0:02:33.676,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But because there could be, like, 10 molecules with the exact same mass,

41
0:02:38.093,000 --> 0:02:39,000
we don't know exactly what they are,

42
0:02:39.924,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and if you want to clearly identify all of them,

43
0:02:42.722,000 --> 0:02:45,000
you have to do more experiments, which could take decades

44
0:02:45.85,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and billions of dollars.

45
0:02:48.207,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So we developed an artificial intelligence, or AI, platform, to do that.

46
0:02:53.794,000 --> 0:02:55,000
We leveraged the growth of biological data

47
0:02:56.662,000 --> 0:03:,000
and built a database of any existing information about metabolites

48
0:03:01.11,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and their interactions with other molecules.

49
0:03:04.262,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We combined all this data as a meganetwork.

50
0:03:07.71,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Then, from tissues or blood of patients,

51
0:03:11.13,000 --> 0:03:13,000
we measure masses of metabolites

52
0:03:13.905,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and find the masses that are changed in a disease.

53
0:03:17.188,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But, as I mentioned earlier, we don't know exactly what they are.

54
0:03:20.402,000 --> 0:03:25,000
A molecular mass of 180 could be either the glucose, galactose or fructose.

55
0:03:25.561,000 --> 0:03:27,000
They all have the exact same mass

56
0:03:27.604,000 --> 0:03:29,000
but different functions in our body.

57
0:03:29.715,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Our AI algorithm considered all these ambiguities.

58
0:03:33.326,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It then mined that meganetwork

59
0:03:36.086,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to find how those metabolic masses are connected to each other

60
0:03:40.463,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that result in disease.

61
0:03:42.445,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And because of the way they are connected,

62
0:03:44.707,000 --> 0:03:48,000
then we are able to infer what each metabolite mass is,

63
0:03:49.054,000 --> 0:03:51,000
like that 180 could be glucose here,

64
0:03:52.002,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and, more importantly, to discover

65
0:03:54.577,000 --> 0:03:57,000
how changes in glucose and other metabolites

66
0:03:57.968,000 --> 0:03:58,000
lead to a disease.

67
0:03:59.497,000 --> 0:04:01,000
This novel understanding of disease mechanisms

68
0:04:02.516,000 --> 0:04:06,000
then enable us to discover effective therapeutics to target that.

69
0:04:07.601,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So we formed a start-up company to bring this technology to the market

70
0:04:11.47,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and impact people's lives.

71
0:04:13.722,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Now my team and I at ReviveMed are working to discover

72
0:04:17.291,000 --> 0:04:22,000
therapeutics for major diseases that metabolites are key drivers for,

73
0:04:22.42,000 --> 0:04:23,000
like fatty liver disease,

74
0:04:24.341,000 --> 0:04:26,000
because it is caused by accumulation of fats,

75
0:04:27.289,000 --> 0:04:29,000
which are types of metabolites in the liver.

76
0:04:29.786,000 --> 0:04:32,000
As I mentioned earlier, it's a huge epidemic with no treatment.

77
0:04:33.75,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And fatty liver disease is just one example.

78
0:04:36.498,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Moving forward, we are going to tackle hundreds of other diseases

79
0:04:40.7,000 --> 0:04:41,000
with no treatment.

80
0:04:42.217,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And by collecting more and more data about metabolites

81
0:04:46.795,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and understanding how changes in metabolites

82
0:04:50.363,000 --> 0:04:52,000
leads to developing diseases,

83
0:04:52.789,000 --> 0:04:55,000
our algorithms will get smarter and smarter

84
0:04:56.302,000 --> 0:05:,000
to discover the right therapeutics for the right patients.

85
0:05:00.522,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And we will get closer to reach our vision

86
0:05:04.316,000 --> 0:05:07,000
of saving lives with every line of code.

87
0:05:08.203,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Thank you.

88
0:05:09.548,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.668,000 --> 0:00:13,000
At every stage of our lives

2
0:00:14.618,000 --> 0:00:17,000
we make decisions that will profoundly influence

3
0:00:18.186,000 --> 0:00:19,000
the lives of the people we're going to become,

4
0:00:20.072,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and then when we become those people,

5
0:00:21.692,000 --> 0:00:23,000
we're not always thrilled with the decisions we made.

6
0:00:24.11,000 --> 0:00:26,000
So young people pay good money

7
0:00:26.624,000 --> 0:00:28,000
to get tattoos removed that teenagers

8
0:00:29.328,000 --> 0:00:3,000
paid good money to get.

9
0:00:30.698,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Middle-aged people rushed to divorce people

10
0:00:33.206,000 --> 0:00:35,000
who young adults rushed to marry.

11
0:00:35.823,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Older adults work hard to lose

12
0:00:38.46,000 --> 0:00:4,000
what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain.

13
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
On and on and on.

14
0:00:42.276,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The question is, as a psychologist, that fascinates me is,

15
0:00:45.308,000 --> 0:00:46,000
why do we make decisions

16
0:00:47.06,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that our future selves so often regret?

17
0:00:50.756,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Now, I think one of the reasons --

18
0:00:52.608,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I'll try to convince you today —

19
0:00:54.06,000 --> 0:00:56,000
is that we have a fundamental misconception

20
0:00:56.62,000 --> 0:00:58,000
about the power of time.

21
0:00:59.452,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Every one of you knows that the rate of change

22
0:01:01.932,000 --> 0:01:02,000
slows over the human lifespan,

23
0:01:03.854,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that your children seem to change by the minute

24
0:01:06.712,000 --> 0:01:08,000
but your parents seem to change by the year.

25
0:01:09.466,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But what is the name of this magical point in life

26
0:01:12.886,000 --> 0:01:14,000
where change suddenly goes

27
0:01:14.922,000 --> 0:01:15,000
from a gallop to a crawl?

28
0:01:16.704,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Is it teenage years? Is it middle age?

29
0:01:19.44,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Is it old age? The answer, it turns out,

30
0:01:22.11,000 --> 0:01:24,000
for most people, is now,

31
0:01:24.64,000 --> 0:01:26,000
wherever now happens to be.

32
0:01:27.591,000 --> 0:01:29,000
What I want to convince you today

33
0:01:29.593,000 --> 0:01:32,000
is that all of us are walking around with an illusion,

34
0:01:32.612,000 --> 0:01:35,000
an illusion that history, our personal history,

35
0:01:35.83,000 --> 0:01:36,000
has just come to an end,

36
0:01:37.444,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that we have just recently become

37
0:01:39.051,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the people that we were always meant to be

38
0:01:42.206,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and will be for the rest of our lives.

39
0:01:44.652,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Let me give you some data to back up that claim.

40
0:01:46.756,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So here's a study of change in people's

41
0:01:49.91,000 --> 0:01:51,000
personal values over time.

42
0:01:51.942,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Here's three values.

43
0:01:53.141,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Everybody here holds all of them,

44
0:01:54.656,000 --> 0:01:56,000
but you probably know that as you grow,

45
0:01:56.814,000 --> 0:01:59,000
as you age, the balance of these values shifts.

46
0:02:00.173,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So how does it do so?

47
0:02:02.082,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Well, we asked thousands of people.

48
0:02:04.09,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We asked half of them to predict for us

49
0:02:05.877,000 --> 0:02:08,000
how much their values would change in the next 10 years,

50
0:02:08.887,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and the others to tell us

51
0:02:10.263,000 --> 0:02:13,000
how much their values had changed in the last 10 years.

52
0:02:13.513,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis,

53
0:02:16.98,000 --> 0:02:18,000
because it allowed us to compare the predictions

54
0:02:19.191,000 --> 0:02:2,000
of people, say, 18 years old,

55
0:02:21.185,000 --> 0:02:23,000
to the reports of people who were 28,

56
0:02:23.297,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan.

57
0:02:25.917,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Here's what we found.

58
0:02:27.248,000 --> 0:02:28,000
First of all, you are right,

59
0:02:28.541,000 --> 0:02:3,000
change does slow down as we age,

60
0:02:31.389,000 --> 0:02:32,000
but second, you're wrong,

61
0:02:33.281,000 --> 0:02:36,000
because it doesn't slow nearly as much as we think.

62
0:02:36.679,000 --> 0:02:39,000
At every age, from 18 to 68 in our data set,

63
0:02:40.542,000 --> 0:02:43,000
people vastly underestimated how much change

64
0:02:44.252,000 --> 0:02:46,000
they would experience over the next 10 years.

65
0:02:47.171,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We call this the "end of history" illusion.

66
0:02:50.105,000 --> 0:02:52,000
To give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect,

67
0:02:52.488,000 --> 0:02:53,000
you can connect these two lines,

68
0:02:53.71,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and what you see here is that 18-year-olds

69
0:02:56.474,000 --> 0:02:58,000
anticipate changing only as much

70
0:02:58.943,000 --> 0:03:,000
as 50-year-olds actually do.

71
0:03:01.928,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Now it's not just values. It's all sorts of other things.

72
0:03:05.482,000 --> 0:03:06,000
For example, personality.

73
0:03:07.3,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Many of you know that psychologists now claim

74
0:03:09.966,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that there are five fundamental dimensions of personality:

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
neuroticism, openness to experience,

76
0:03:15.527,000 --> 0:03:18,000
agreeableness, extraversion, and conscientiousness.

77
0:03:19.375,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Again, we asked people how much they expected

78
0:03:21.622,000 --> 0:03:22,000
to change over the next 10 years,

79
0:03:23.198,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and also how much they had changed over the last 10 years,

80
0:03:26.559,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and what we found,

81
0:03:27.475,000 --> 0:03:29,000
well, you're going to get used to seeing this diagram over and over,

82
0:03:30.03,000 --> 0:03:32,000
because once again the rate of change

83
0:03:32.069,000 --> 0:03:33,000
does slow as we age,

84
0:03:33.679,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but at every age, people underestimate

85
0:03:37.567,000 --> 0:03:39,000
how much their personalities will change

86
0:03:39.9,000 --> 0:03:4,000
in the next decade.

87
0:03:41.684,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And it isn't just ephemeral things

88
0:03:44.005,000 --> 0:03:45,000
like values and personality.

89
0:03:45.859,000 --> 0:03:48,000
You can ask people about their likes and dislikes,

90
0:03:48.874,000 --> 0:03:49,000
their basic preferences.

91
0:03:50.328,000 --> 0:03:52,000
For example, name your best friend,

92
0:03:53.13,000 --> 0:03:54,000
your favorite kind of vacation,

93
0:03:54.546,000 --> 0:03:55,000
what's your favorite hobby,

94
0:03:56.312,000 --> 0:03:57,000
what's your favorite kind of music.

95
0:03:58.123,000 --> 0:03:59,000
People can name these things.

96
0:03:59.56,000 --> 0:04:01,000
We ask half of them to tell us,

97
0:04:01.92,000 --> 0:04:04,000
"Do you think that that will change over the next 10 years?"

98
0:04:05.313,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and half of them to tell us,

99
0:04:06.467,000 --> 0:04:08,000
"Did that change over the last 10 years?"

100
0:04:09.158,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And what we find, well, you've seen it twice now,

101
0:04:11.741,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and here it is again:

102
0:04:13.583,000 --> 0:04:16,000
people predict that the friend they have now

103
0:04:16.663,000 --> 0:04:17,000
is the friend they'll have in 10 years,

104
0:04:18.211,000 --> 0:04:2,000
the vacation they most enjoy now is the one

105
0:04:20.316,000 --> 0:04:21,000
they'll enjoy in 10 years,

106
0:04:21.648,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and yet, people who are 10 years older all say,

107
0:04:24.39,000 --> 0:04:26,000
"Eh, you know, that's really changed."

108
0:04:27.319,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Does any of this matter?

109
0:04:28.475,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Is this just a form of mis-prediction that doesn't have consequences?

110
0:04:31.635,000 --> 0:04:33,000
No, it matters quite a bit, and I'll give you an example of why.

111
0:04:34.557,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It bedevils our decision-making in important ways.

112
0:04:38.022,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Bring to mind right now for yourself

113
0:04:39.727,000 --> 0:04:41,000
your favorite musician today

114
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and your favorite musician 10 years ago.

115
0:04:44.368,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I put mine up on the screen to help you along.

116
0:04:46.927,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Now we asked people

117
0:04:48.53,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to predict for us, to tell us

118
0:04:50.767,000 --> 0:04:52,000
how much money they would pay right now

119
0:04:53.654,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to see their current favorite musician

120
0:04:55.99,000 --> 0:04:57,000
perform in concert 10 years from now,

121
0:04:58.507,000 --> 0:05:,000
and on average, people said they would pay

122
0:05:00.554,000 --> 0:05:02,000
129 dollars for that ticket.

123
0:05:03.271,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And yet, when we asked them how much they would pay

124
0:05:06.198,000 --> 0:05:08,000
to see the person who was their favorite

125
0:05:08.519,000 --> 0:05:1,000
10 years ago perform today,

126
0:05:10.558,000 --> 0:05:11,000
they say only 80 dollars.

127
0:05:12.4,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Now, in a perfectly rational world,

128
0:05:14.238,000 --> 0:05:16,000
these should be the same number,

129
0:05:16.352,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but we overpay for the opportunity

130
0:05:18.863,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to indulge our current preferences

131
0:05:20.966,000 --> 0:05:23,000
because we overestimate their stability.

132
0:05:24.286,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Why does this happen? We're not entirely sure,

133
0:05:26.734,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but it probably has to do

134
0:05:28.28,000 --> 0:05:3,000
with the ease of remembering

135
0:05:30.459,000 --> 0:05:32,000
versus the difficulty of imagining.

136
0:05:32.98,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Most of us can remember who we were 10 years ago,

137
0:05:35.449,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but we find it hard to imagine who we're going to be,

138
0:05:38.188,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and then we mistakenly think that because it's hard to imagine,

139
0:05:41.193,000 --> 0:05:43,000
it's not likely to happen.

140
0:05:43.267,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Sorry, when people say "I can't imagine that,"

141
0:05:46.522,000 --> 0:05:48,000
they're usually talking about their own lack of imagination,

142
0:05:49.47,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and not about the unlikelihood

143
0:05:50.962,000 --> 0:05:52,000
of the event that they're describing.

144
0:05:53.952,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The bottom line is, time is a powerful force.

145
0:05:57.519,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It transforms our preferences.

146
0:05:59.162,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It reshapes our values.

147
0:06:01.28,000 --> 0:06:02,000
It alters our personalities.

148
0:06:02.623,000 --> 0:06:04,000
We seem to appreciate this fact,

149
0:06:05.19,000 --> 0:06:06,000
but only in retrospect.

150
0:06:06.751,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Only when we look backwards do we realize

151
0:06:09.246,000 --> 0:06:12,000
how much change happens in a decade.

152
0:06:12.518,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It's as if, for most of us,

153
0:06:14.197,000 --> 0:06:16,000
the present is a magic time.

154
0:06:16.366,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It's a watershed on the timeline.

155
0:06:18.383,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It's the moment at which we finally

156
0:06:20.727,000 --> 0:06:22,000
become ourselves.

157
0:06:23.23,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Human beings are works in progress

158
0:06:25.923,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that mistakenly think they're finished.

159
0:06:28.846,000 --> 0:06:29,000
The person you are right now

160
0:06:30.636,000 --> 0:06:33,000
is as transient, as fleeting and as temporary

161
0:06:34.338,000 --> 0:06:36,000
as all the people you've ever been.

162
0:06:36.997,000 --> 0:06:39,000
The one constant in our life is change.

163
0:06:40.545,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Thank you.

0:06:42.641,000 --> 0:06:43,000

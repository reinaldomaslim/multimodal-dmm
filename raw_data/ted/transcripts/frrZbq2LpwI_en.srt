2
0:00:16.327,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So wouldn't it be amazing if our phones

3
0:00:19.05,000 --> 0:00:21,000
could see the world in the same way that we do,

4
0:00:21.448,000 --> 0:00:22,000
as we're walking around being able

5
0:00:23.374,000 --> 0:00:25,000
to point a phone at anything,

6
0:00:25.573,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and then have it actually recognize images and objects

7
0:00:27.668,000 --> 0:00:29,000
like the human brain, and then be able to pull in information

8
0:00:30.438,000 --> 0:00:32,000
from an almost infinite library of knowledge

9
0:00:33.437,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and experiences and ideas.

10
0:00:35.55,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Well, traditionally that was seen as science fiction,

11
0:00:37.637,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but now we've moved to a world

12
0:00:38.787,000 --> 0:00:4,000
where actually this has become possible.

13
0:00:41.118,000 --> 0:00:43,000
So the best way of explaining it is to just show it.

14
0:00:43.713,000 --> 0:00:44,000
What you can see over here is Tamara,

15
0:00:45.318,000 --> 0:00:46,000
who is holding my phone that's now plugged in.

16
0:00:47.133,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So let me start with this.

17
0:00:49.069,000 --> 0:00:5,000
What we have here is a painting

18
0:00:50.637,000 --> 0:00:52,000
of the great poet Rabbie Burns,

19
0:00:52.893,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and it's just a normal image,

20
0:00:54.71,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but if we now switch inputs over to the phone,

21
0:00:57.101,000 --> 0:00:59,000
running our technology, you can see

22
0:00:59.326,000 --> 0:01:01,000
effectively what Tamara's seeing on the screen,

23
0:01:01.668,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and when she points at this image,

24
0:01:03.221,000 --> 0:01:05,000
something magical happens.

25
0:01:05.438,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Laughter) (Bagpipes)

26
0:01:09.8,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Bagpipes) (Applause)

27
0:01:12.408,000 --> 0:01:18,000
(Bagpipes)

28
0:01:19.303,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Voice: Now simmer blinks on flowery braes ...

29
0:01:21.086,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Matt Mills: Now, what's great about this is,

30
0:01:22.711,000 --> 0:01:23,000
there's no trickery here.

31
0:01:24.523,000 --> 0:01:26,000
There's nothing done to this image.

32
0:01:27.159,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And what's great about this is the technology's

33
0:01:30.184,000 --> 0:01:32,000
actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand

34
0:01:32.759,000 --> 0:01:34,000
much like how the human brain does.

35
0:01:34.889,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Not only that, but as I move the object around,

36
0:01:37.392,000 --> 0:01:43,000
it's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly.

37
0:01:43.431,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Again, the thing that's incredible about this is

38
0:01:45.468,000 --> 0:01:47,000
this is how advanced these devices have become.

39
0:01:47.654,000 --> 0:01:49,000
All the processing to do that was actually done

40
0:01:49.782,000 --> 0:01:51,000
on the device itself.

41
0:01:52.248,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Now, this has applications everywhere,

42
0:01:54.299,000 --> 0:01:57,000
whether in things like art in museums, like you just saw,

43
0:01:58.014,000 --> 0:02:01,000
or in the world of, say, advertising, or print journalism.

44
0:02:01.269,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it's printed.

45
0:02:04.67,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And here is this morning's newspaper,

46
0:02:06.662,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and we have some Wimbledon news, which is great.

47
0:02:08.84,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper

48
0:02:11.805,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and immediately get the bulletin.

49
0:02:13.901,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Voice: ... To the grass, and it's very important that you adapt

50
0:02:17.132,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and you, you have to be flexible, you have to be willing

51
0:02:19.528,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to change direction at a split second,

52
0:02:22.049,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and she does all that. She's won this title.

53
0:02:25.031,000 --> 0:02:28,000
MM: And that linking of the digital content

54
0:02:28.216,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to something that's physical is what we call an aura, and

55
0:02:30.645,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk.

56
0:02:33.012,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So, what's great about this is it isn't just a faster,

57
0:02:36.304,000 --> 0:02:38,000
more convenient way to get information in the real world,

58
0:02:39.124,000 --> 0:02:41,000
but there are times when actually using this medium

59
0:02:41.643,000 --> 0:02:43,000
allows you to be able to display information in a way

60
0:02:43.975,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that was never before possible.

61
0:02:46.09,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So what I have here is a wireless router.

62
0:02:48.929,000 --> 0:02:51,000
My American colleagues have told me I've got to call it a router,

63
0:02:52.194,000 --> 0:02:53,000
so that everyone here understands — (Laughter) —

64
0:02:54.014,000 --> 0:02:57,000
but nonetheless, here is the device.

65
0:02:57.459,000 --> 0:03:,000
So now what I can do is, rather than getting the instructions

66
0:03:00.529,000 --> 0:03:02,000
for the device online, I can simply point at it,

67
0:03:03.135,000 --> 0:03:07,000
the device is recognized, and then --

68
0:03:07.707,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Voice: Begin by plugging in the grey ADSL cable.

69
0:03:10.819,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Then connect the power. Finally, the yellow ethernet cable.

70
0:03:16.29,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Congratulations. You have now completed setup.

71
0:03:19.646,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Laughter) MM: Awesome. Thank you.

72
0:03:21.812,000 --> 0:03:24,000
(Applause)

73
0:03:24.922,000 --> 0:03:26,000
The incredible work that made that possible was done

74
0:03:27.9,000 --> 0:03:29,000
here in the U.K. by scientists at Cambridge,

75
0:03:30.738,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and they work in our offices,

76
0:03:32.523,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and I've got a lovely picture of them here.

77
0:03:34.051,000 --> 0:03:35,000
They couldn't all be on stage, but we're going to

78
0:03:35.81,000 --> 0:03:38,000
bring their aura to the stage, so here they are.

79
0:03:43.215,000 --> 0:03:44,000
They're not very animated. (Laughter)

80
0:03:45.139,000 --> 0:03:49,000
This was the fourth take, I'm told. (Laughter)

81
0:03:49.407,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Okay. So, as we're talking about Cambridge,

82
0:03:52.872,000 --> 0:03:54,000
let's now move on to technical advancements,

83
0:03:55.233,000 --> 0:03:57,000
because since we started putting this technology

84
0:03:57.4,000 --> 0:04:01,000
on mobile phones less than 12 months ago,

85
0:04:01.515,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the speed and the processing in these devices

86
0:04:03.569,000 --> 0:04:05,000
has grown at a really phenomenal rate,

87
0:04:05.969,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and that means that I can now take cinema-quality

88
0:04:08.223,000 --> 0:04:11,000
3D models and place them in the world around me,

89
0:04:11.433,000 --> 0:04:13,000
so I have one over here.

90
0:04:13.617,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Tamara, would you like to jump in?

91
0:04:19.025,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Music)

92
0:04:21.854,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Dinosaur roaring) (Laughter)

93
0:04:26.861,000 --> 0:04:28,000
MM: I should leap in.

94
0:04:29.038,000 --> 0:04:32,000
(Music) (Dinosaur roaring)

95
0:04:32.815,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Applause)

96
0:04:37.964,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So then, after the fun, comes the more emotional side

97
0:04:40.404,000 --> 0:04:42,000
of what we do, because effectively, this technology

98
0:04:42.86,000 --> 0:04:44,000
allows you to see the world through someone's eyes,

99
0:04:45.252,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and for that person to be able to take a moment in time

100
0:04:48.165,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and effectively store it and tag it to something physical

101
0:04:51.298,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that exists in the real world.

102
0:04:53.275,000 --> 0:04:55,000
What's great about this is, the tools to do this are free.

103
0:04:55.796,000 --> 0:04:58,000
They're open, they're available to everyone within our application,

104
0:04:58.924,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and educators have really got on board with the classrooms.

105
0:05:02.606,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So we have teachers who've tagged up textbooks,

106
0:05:04.98,000 --> 0:05:06,000
teachers who've tagged up school classrooms,

107
0:05:07.02,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and a great example of this is a school in the U.K.

108
0:05:09.193,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I have a picture here from a video, and we're now going to play it.

109
0:05:13.632,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Teacher: See what happens. (Children talking) Keep going.

110
0:05:21.372,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Child: TV. (Children react)

111
0:05:25.285,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Child: Oh my God.

112
0:05:26.665,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Teacher: Now move it either side. See what happens.

113
0:05:29.219,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Move away from it and come back to it.

114
0:05:32.631,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Child: Oh, that is so cool.

115
0:05:35.776,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Teacher: And then, have you got it again?

116
0:05:38.663,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Child: Oh my God! How did you do that?

117
0:05:43.071,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Second child: It's magic.

118
0:05:45.803,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Laughter) MM: (Laughs) So, it's not magic.

119
0:05:49.376,000 --> 0:05:5,000
It's available for everyone to do,

120
0:05:51.143,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and actually I'm going to show you how easy it is to do

121
0:05:53.028,000 --> 0:05:54,000
by doing one right now.

122
0:05:54.317,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So, as sort of — I'm told it's called a stadium wave,

123
0:05:57.073,000 --> 0:05:58,000
so we're going to start from this side of the room

124
0:05:58.39,000 --> 0:05:59,000
on the count of three, and go over to here.

125
0:06:00.34,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Tamara, are you recording?

126
0:06:01.723,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Okay, so are you all ready?

127
0:06:03.607,000 --> 0:06:05,000
One, two, three. Go!

128
0:06:05.806,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Audience: Whooooooo!

129
0:06:09.431,000 --> 0:06:12,000
MM: Fellows are really good at that. (Laughs) (Laughter)

130
0:06:12.865,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Okay. Now we're going to switch back

131
0:06:14.562,000 --> 0:06:15,000
into the Aurasma application,

132
0:06:16.383,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and what Tamara's going to do is tag that video that we just

133
0:06:19.768,000 --> 0:06:25,000
took onto my badge, so that I can remember it forever.

134
0:06:25.807,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Now, we have lots of people who are doing this already,

135
0:06:29.112,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and we've talked a little bit about the educational side.

136
0:06:31.37,000 --> 0:06:33,000
On the emotional side, we have people who've

137
0:06:33.52,000 --> 0:06:36,000
done things like send postcards and Christmas cards

138
0:06:36.592,000 --> 0:06:39,000
back to their family with little messages on them.

139
0:06:39.818,000 --> 0:06:41,000
We have people who have, for example,

140
0:06:42.047,000 --> 0:06:44,000
taken the inside of the engine bay of an old car

141
0:06:44.104,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and tagged up different components within an engine,

142
0:06:46.569,000 --> 0:06:48,000
so that if you're stuck and you want to find out more,

143
0:06:48.848,000 --> 0:06:5,000
you can point and discover the information.

144
0:06:51.409,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We're all very, very familiar with the Internet.

145
0:06:54.479,000 --> 0:06:56,000
In the last 20 years, it's really

146
0:06:57.329,000 --> 0:06:58,000
changed the way that we live and work,

147
0:06:59.223,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and the way that we see the world, and what's great is,

148
0:07:02.255,000 --> 0:07:04,000
we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift,

149
0:07:04.569,000 --> 0:07:07,000
because now we can literally take the content

150
0:07:07.976,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that we share, we discover, and that we enjoy

151
0:07:11.172,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and make it a part of the world around us.

152
0:07:13.544,000 --> 0:07:14,000
It's completely free to download this application.

153
0:07:15.37,000 --> 0:07:17,000
If you have a good Wi-Fi connection or 3G,

154
0:07:18.104,000 --> 0:07:19,000
this process is very, very quick.

155
0:07:19.369,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Oh, there we are. We can save it now.

156
0:07:21.282,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It's just going to do a tiny bit of processing

157
0:07:23.518,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to convert that image that we just took

158
0:07:25.639,000 --> 0:07:26,000
into a sort of digital fingerprint,

159
0:07:27.543,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and the great thing is, if you're a professional user,

160
0:07:29.576,000 --> 0:07:31,000
-- so, a newspaper -- the tools are pretty much identical

161
0:07:32.256,000 --> 0:07:34,000
to what we've just used to create this demonstration.

162
0:07:34.75,000 --> 0:07:35,000
The only difference is that you've got the ability

163
0:07:36.462,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to add in links and slightly more content. Are you now ready?

164
0:07:39.139,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Tamara Roukaerts: We're ready to go.

165
0:07:40.191,000 --> 0:07:42,000
MM: Okay. So, I'm told we're ready, which means

166
0:07:42.397,000 --> 0:07:44,000
we can now point at the image, and there you all are.

167
0:07:44.816,000 --> 0:07:5,000
MM on video: One, two, three. Go!

168
0:07:51.211,000 --> 0:07:53,000
MM: Well done. We've been Aurasma. Thank you.

169
0:07:53.56,000 --> 0:07:58,000
(Applause)

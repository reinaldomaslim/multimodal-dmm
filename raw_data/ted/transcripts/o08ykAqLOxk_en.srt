1
0:00:12.452,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Do you think the world is going to be a better place next year?

2
0:00:18.12,000 --> 0:00:19,000
In the next decade?

3
0:00:20.657,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Can we end hunger,

4
0:00:23.444,000 --> 0:00:25,000
achieve gender equality,

5
0:00:25.999,000 --> 0:00:27,000
halt climate change,

6
0:00:28.145,000 --> 0:00:3,000
all in the next 15 years?

7
0:00:31.764,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Well, according to the governments of the world, yes we can.

8
0:00:36.343,000 --> 0:00:38,000
In the last few days, the leaders of the world,

9
0:00:38.985,000 --> 0:00:4,000
meeting at the UN in New York,

10
0:00:41.485,000 --> 0:00:43,000
agreed a new set of Global Goals

11
0:00:44.264,000 --> 0:00:46,000
for the development of the world to 2030.

12
0:00:47.493,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And here they are:

13
0:00:48.94,000 --> 0:00:52,000
these goals are the product of a massive consultation exercise.

14
0:00:53.658,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The Global Goals are who we, humanity, want to be.

15
0:00:59.423,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Now that's the plan, but can we get there?

16
0:01:03.599,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Can this vision for a better world really be achieved?

17
0:01:08.247,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Well, I'm here today because we've run the numbers,

18
0:01:12.031,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and the answer, shockingly,

19
0:01:16.599,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is that maybe we actually can.

20
0:01:19.599,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But not with business as usual.

21
0:01:23.757,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Now, the idea that the world is going to get a better place

22
0:01:26.836,000 --> 0:01:27,000
may seem a little fanciful.

23
0:01:29.17,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Watch the news every day and the world seems to be going backwards, not forwards.

24
0:01:33.599,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And let's be frank:

25
0:01:35.321,000 --> 0:01:38,000
it's pretty easy to be skeptical about grand announcements

26
0:01:38.599,000 --> 0:01:39,000
coming out of the UN.

27
0:01:41.067,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But please, I invite you to suspend your disbelief for just a moment.

28
0:01:45.956,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Because back in 2001,

29
0:01:47.877,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the UN agreed another set of goals, the Millennium Development Goals.

30
0:01:53.138,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And the flagship target there was to halve the proportion of people

31
0:01:57.362,000 --> 0:01:59,000
living in poverty by 2015.

32
0:02:01.072,000 --> 0:02:04,000
The target was to take from a baseline of 1990,

33
0:02:04.913,000 --> 0:02:07,000
when 36 percent of the world's population lived in poverty,

34
0:02:08.599,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to get to 18 percent poverty this year.

35
0:02:12.599,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Did we hit this target?

36
0:02:14.599,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Well, no, we didn't.

37
0:02:16.599,000 --> 0:02:17,000
We exceeded it.

38
0:02:18.677,000 --> 0:02:22,000
This year, global poverty is going to fall to 12 percent.

39
0:02:23.804,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Now, that's still not good enough,

40
0:02:25.599,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and the world does still have plenty of problems.

41
0:02:29.242,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But the pessimists and doomsayers who say that the world can't get better

42
0:02:34.701,000 --> 0:02:35,000
are simply wrong.

43
0:02:37.748,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So how did we achieve this success?

44
0:02:40.002,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Well, a lot of it was because of economic growth.

45
0:02:43.383,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Some of the biggest reductions in poverty were in countries such as China and India,

46
0:02:48.599,000 --> 0:02:51,000
which have seen rapid economic growth in recent years.

47
0:02:52.898,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So can we pull off the same trick again?

48
0:02:55.934,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Can economic growth get us to the Global Goals?

49
0:03:00.642,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Well, to answer that question,

50
0:03:02.405,000 --> 0:03:06,000
we need to benchmark where the world is today against the Global Goals

51
0:03:06.599,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and figure out how far we have to travel.

52
0:03:10.046,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But that ain't easy,

53
0:03:11.973,000 --> 0:03:13,000
because the Global Goals aren't just ambitious,

54
0:03:14.814,000 --> 0:03:16,000
they're also pretty complicated.

55
0:03:17.599,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Over 17 goals, there are then 169 targets

56
0:03:21.767,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and literally hundreds of indicators.

57
0:03:25.444,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Also, while some of the goals are pretty specific --

58
0:03:29.072,000 --> 0:03:3,000
end hunger --

59
0:03:30.519,000 --> 0:03:31,000
others are a lot vaguer --

60
0:03:32.439,000 --> 0:03:34,000
promote peaceful and tolerant societies.

61
0:03:35.924,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So to help us with this benchmarking,

62
0:03:37.873,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I'm going to use a tool called the Social Progress Index.

63
0:03:42.166,000 --> 0:03:45,000
What this does is measures all the stuff the Global Goals are trying to achieve,

64
0:03:46.144,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but sums it up into a single number that we can use as our benchmark

65
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and track progress over time.

66
0:03:52.9,000 --> 0:03:55,000
The Social Progress Index basically asks three fundamental questions

67
0:03:56.477,000 --> 0:03:57,000
about a society.

68
0:03:58.214,000 --> 0:04:01,000
First of all, does everyone have the basic needs of survival:

69
0:04:01.703,000 --> 0:04:03,000
food, water, shelter, safety?

70
0:04:04.535,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Secondly, does everyone have the building blocks of a better life:

71
0:04:08.313,000 --> 0:04:12,000
education, information, health and a sustainable environment?

72
0:04:13.153,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And does everyone have the opportunity to improve their lives,

73
0:04:16.863,000 --> 0:04:2,000
through rights, freedom of choice, freedom from discrimination,

74
0:04:20.887,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and access to the world's most advanced knowledge?

75
0:04:24.463,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The Social Progress Index sums all this together using 52 indicators

76
0:04:28.599,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to create an aggregate score on a scale of 0 to 100.

77
0:04:33.436,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And what we find is that there's a wide diversity of performance

78
0:04:36.623,000 --> 0:04:37,000
in the world today.

79
0:04:38.189,000 --> 0:04:41,000
The highest performing country, Norway, scores 88.

80
0:04:42.281,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The lowest performing country, Central African Republic, scores 31.

81
0:04:47.599,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And we can add up all the countries together,

82
0:04:49.719,000 --> 0:04:51,000
weighting for the different population sizes,

83
0:04:52.177,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and that global score is 61.

84
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
In concrete terms,

85
0:04:57.335,000 --> 0:05:,000
that means that the average human being is living on a level of social progress

86
0:05:01.117,000 --> 0:05:04,000
about the same of Cuba or Kazakhstan today.

87
0:05:05.229,000 --> 0:05:07,000
That's where we are today: 61 out of 100.

88
0:05:08.42,000 --> 0:05:11,000
What do we have to get to to achieve the Global Goals?

89
0:05:12.254,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now, the Global Goals are certainly ambitious,

90
0:05:14.766,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but they're not about turning the world into Norway in just 15 years.

91
0:05:19.395,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So having looked at the numbers, my estimate is that a score of 75

92
0:05:23.518,000 --> 0:05:27,000
would not only be a giant leap forward in human well-being,

93
0:05:27.599,000 --> 0:05:3,000
it would also count as hitting the Global Goals target.

94
0:05:31.412,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So there's our target, 75 out of 100.

95
0:05:34.222,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Can we get there?

96
0:05:36.275,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Well, the Social Progress Index can help us calculate this,

97
0:05:39.283,000 --> 0:05:4,000
because as you might have noticed,

98
0:05:40.973,000 --> 0:05:42,000
there are no economic indicators in there;

99
0:05:43.222,000 --> 0:05:47,000
there's no GDP or economic growth in the Social Progress Index model.

100
0:05:48.032,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And what that lets us do is understand the relationship

101
0:05:51.599,000 --> 0:05:54,000
between economic growth and social progress.

102
0:05:55.749,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Let me show you on this chart.

103
0:05:57.393,000 --> 0:06:,000
So here on the vertical axis, I've put social progress,

104
0:06:00.599,000 --> 0:06:02,000
the stuff the Global Goals are trying to achieve.

105
0:06:03.191,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Higher is better.

106
0:06:04.761,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And then on the horizontal axis, is GDP per capita.

107
0:06:08.169,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Further to the right means richer.

108
0:06:10.732,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And in there, I'm now going to put all the countries of the world,

109
0:06:14.056,000 --> 0:06:16,000
each one represented by a dot,

110
0:06:16.188,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and on top of that I'm going to put the regression line

111
0:06:18.807,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that shows the average relationship.

112
0:06:21.161,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And what this tells us is that as we get richer,

113
0:06:24.715,000 --> 0:06:26,000
social progress does tend to improve.

114
0:06:28.072,000 --> 0:06:32,000
However, as we get richer, each extra dollar of GDP

115
0:06:32.687,000 --> 0:06:35,000
is buying us less and less social progress.

116
0:06:37.109,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And now we can use this information to start building our forecast.

117
0:06:41.403,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So here is the world in 2015.

118
0:06:44.718,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We have a social progress score of 61

119
0:06:48.14,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and a GDP per capita of $14,000.

120
0:06:51.895,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And the place we're trying to get to, remember, is 75, that Global Goals target.

121
0:06:56.147,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So here we are today, $14,000 per capita GDP.

122
0:07:00.29,000 --> 0:07:02,000
How rich are we going to be in 2030?

123
0:07:02.679,000 --> 0:07:03,000
That's what we need to know next.

124
0:07:04.541,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Well, the best forecast we can find comes from the US Department of Agriculture,

125
0:07:08.816,000 --> 0:07:12,000
which forecasts 3.1 percent average global economic growth

126
0:07:13.491,000 --> 0:07:14,000
over the next 15 years,

127
0:07:15.259,000 --> 0:07:18,000
which means that in 2030, if they're right,

128
0:07:18.402,000 --> 0:07:22,000
per capita GDP will be about $23,000.

129
0:07:23.293,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So now the question is: if we get that much richer,

130
0:07:25.858,000 --> 0:07:27,000
how much social progress are we going to get?

131
0:07:28.747,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Well, we asked a team of economists at Deloitte

132
0:07:31.381,000 --> 0:07:32,000
who checked and crunched the numbers,

133
0:07:33.174,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and they came back and said, well, look: if the world's average wealth goes

134
0:07:38.15,000 --> 0:07:41,000
from $14,000 a year to $23,000 a year,

135
0:07:41.95,000 --> 0:07:43,000
social progress is going to increase

136
0:07:44.262,000 --> 0:07:48,000
from 61 to 62.4.

137
0:07:48.926,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Laughter)

138
0:07:50.863,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Just 62.4. Just a tiny increase.

139
0:07:56.315,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Now this seems a bit strange.

140
0:07:57.886,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Economic growth seems to have really helped

141
0:08:00.122,000 --> 0:08:01,000
in the fight against poverty,

142
0:08:01.835,000 --> 0:08:03,000
but it doesn't seem to be having much impact

143
0:08:04.059,000 --> 0:08:06,000
on trying to get to the Global Goals.

144
0:08:06.467,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So what's going on?

145
0:08:08.182,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Well, I think there are two things.

146
0:08:09.897,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The first is that in a way, we're the victims of our own success.

147
0:08:13.788,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We've used up the easy wins from economic growth,

148
0:08:16.804,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and now we're moving on to harder problems.

149
0:08:19.65,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And also, we know that economic growth comes with costs as well as benefits.

150
0:08:24.062,000 --> 0:08:28,000
There are costs to the environment, costs from new health problems like obesity.

151
0:08:29.825,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So that's the bad news.

152
0:08:31.531,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We're not going to get to the Global Goals just by getting richer.

153
0:08:36.211,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So are the pessimists right?

154
0:08:38.599,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Well, maybe not.

155
0:08:39.965,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Because the Social Progress Index also has some very good news.

156
0:08:44.683,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Let me take you back to that regression line.

157
0:08:47.066,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So this is the average relationship between GDP and social progress,

158
0:08:50.47,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and this is what our last forecast was based on.

159
0:08:54.04,000 --> 0:08:55,000
But as you saw already,

160
0:08:55.737,000 --> 0:08:58,000
there is actually lots of noise around this trend line.

161
0:09:00.471,000 --> 0:09:02,000
What that tells us, quite simply,

162
0:09:02.932,000 --> 0:09:05,000
is that GDP is not destiny.

163
0:09:06.589,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We have countries that are underperforming

164
0:09:09.091,000 --> 0:09:11,000
on social progress, relative to their wealth.

165
0:09:12.321,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Russia has lots of natural resource wealth,

166
0:09:14.695,000 --> 0:09:16,000
but lots of social problems.

167
0:09:16.871,000 --> 0:09:18,000
China has boomed economically,

168
0:09:19.126,000 --> 0:09:23,000
but hasn't made much headway on human rights or environmental issues.

169
0:09:23.93,000 --> 0:09:27,000
India has a space program and millions of people without toilets.

170
0:09:29.264,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Now, on the other hand, we have countries that are overperforming

171
0:09:32.585,000 --> 0:09:34,000
on social progress relative to their GDP.

172
0:09:35.922,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Costa Rica has prioritized education, health and environmental sustainability,

173
0:09:41.657,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and as a result, it's achieving a very high level of social progress,

174
0:09:45.602,000 --> 0:09:48,000
despite only having a rather modest GDP.

175
0:09:49.471,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And Costa Rica's not alone.

176
0:09:51.599,000 --> 0:09:54,000
From poor countries like Rwanda to richer countries like New Zealand,

177
0:09:55.599,000 --> 0:09:58,000
we see that it's possible to get lots of social progress,

178
0:09:59.221,000 --> 0:10:01,000
even if your GDP is not so great.

179
0:10:02.649,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And that's really important, because it tells us two things.

180
0:10:06.284,000 --> 0:10:11,000
First of all, it tells us that we already in the world have the solutions

181
0:10:11.516,000 --> 0:10:14,000
to many of the problems that the Global Goals are trying to solve.

182
0:10:15.879,000 --> 0:10:18,000
It also tells us that we're not slaves to GDP.

183
0:10:20.029,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Our choices matter: if we prioritize the well-being of people,

184
0:10:24.328,000 --> 0:10:27,000
then we can make a lot more progress than our GDP might expect.

185
0:10:29.008,000 --> 0:10:32,000
How much? Enough to get us to the Global Goals?

186
0:10:32.184,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Well, let's look at some numbers.

187
0:10:33.819,000 --> 0:10:36,000
What we know already: the world today is scoring 61 on social progress,

188
0:10:37.704,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and the place we want to get to is 75.

189
0:10:40.526,000 --> 0:10:42,000
If we rely on economic growth alone,

190
0:10:42.77,000 --> 0:10:44,000
we're going to get to 62.4.

191
0:10:45.375,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So let's assume now that we can get the countries that are currently

192
0:10:49.501,000 --> 0:10:52,000
underperforming on social progress -- the Russia, China, Indias --

193
0:10:52.719,000 --> 0:10:53,000
just up to the average.

194
0:10:54.408,000 --> 0:10:56,000
How much social progress does that get us?

195
0:10:56.623,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Well, that takes us to 65.

196
0:10:59.297,000 --> 0:11:01,000
It's a bit better, but still quite a long way to go.

197
0:11:02.227,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So let's get a little bit more optimistic and say,

198
0:11:04.612,000 --> 0:11:06,000
what if every country gets a little bit better

199
0:11:07.426,000 --> 0:11:09,000
at turning its wealth into well-being?

200
0:11:10.194,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Well then, we get to 67.

201
0:11:13.44,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And now let's be even bolder still.

202
0:11:16.119,000 --> 0:11:2,000
What if every country in the world chose to be like Costa Rica

203
0:11:20.599,000 --> 0:11:22,000
in prioritizing human well-being,

204
0:11:22.993,000 --> 0:11:24,000
using its wealth for the well-being of its citizens?

205
0:11:25.599,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Well then, we get to nearly 73, very close to the Global Goals.

206
0:11:30.599,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Can we achieve the Global Goals?

207
0:11:32.599,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Certainly not with business as usual.

208
0:11:35.278,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Even a flood tide of economic growth is not going to get us there,

209
0:11:39.653,000 --> 0:11:42,000
if it just raises the mega-yachts and the super-wealthy

210
0:11:42.74,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and leaves the rest behind.

211
0:11:45.177,000 --> 0:11:48,000
If we're going to achieve the Global Goals we have to do things differently.

212
0:11:49.195,000 --> 0:11:53,000
We have to prioritize social progress, and really scale solutions

213
0:11:53.428,000 --> 0:11:54,000
around the world.

214
0:11:54.942,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I believe the Global Goals are a historic opportunity,

215
0:11:58.681,000 --> 0:12:01,000
because the world's leaders have promised to deliver them.

216
0:12:03.101,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Let's not dismiss the goals or slide into pessimism;

217
0:12:07.098,000 --> 0:12:08,000
let's hold them to that promise.

218
0:12:09.829,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And we need to hold them to that promise by holding them accountable,

219
0:12:13.183,000 --> 0:12:16,000
tracking their progress all the way through the next 15 years.

220
0:12:16.928,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And I want to finish by showing you

221
0:12:18.634,000 --> 0:12:2,000
a way to do that, called the People's Report Card.

222
0:12:21.423,000 --> 0:12:25,000
The People's Report Card brings together all this data into a simple framework

223
0:12:26.354,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that we'll all be familiar with from our school days,

224
0:12:28.918,000 --> 0:12:29,000
to hold them to account.

225
0:12:30.37,000 --> 0:12:32,000
It grades our performance on the Global Goals

226
0:12:32.649,000 --> 0:12:35,000
on a scale from F to A,

227
0:12:36.144,000 --> 0:12:41,000
where F is humanity at its worst, and A is humanity at its best.

228
0:12:41.69,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Our world today is scoring a C-.

229
0:12:47.405,000 --> 0:12:5,000
The Global Goals are all about getting to an A,

230
0:12:50.858,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and that's why we're going to be updating the People's Report Card annually,

231
0:12:54.599,000 --> 0:12:57,000
for the world and for all the countries of the world,

232
0:12:57.836,000 --> 0:12:59,000
so we can hold our leaders to account

233
0:13:00.451,000 --> 0:13:04,000
to achieve this target and fulfill this promise.

234
0:13:05.18,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Because getting to the Global Goals will only happen if we do things differently,

235
0:13:09.851,000 --> 0:13:11,000
if our leaders do things differently,

236
0:13:12.042,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and for that to happen, that needs us to demand it.

237
0:13:16.494,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So let's reject business as usual.

238
0:13:20.455,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Let's demand a different path.

239
0:13:23.365,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Let's choose the world that we want.

240
0:13:28.157,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Thank you.

241
0:13:29.333,000 --> 0:13:34,000
(Applause)

242
0:13:34.599,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Michael.

243
0:13:38.675,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Michael, just one question: the Millennium Development Goals

244
0:13:41.522,000 --> 0:13:42,000
established 15 years ago,

245
0:13:43.027,000 --> 0:13:46,000
they were kind of applying to every country

246
0:13:46.128,000 --> 0:13:49,000
but it turned out to be really a scorecard for emerging countries.

247
0:13:49.719,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Now the new Global Goals are explicitly universal.

248
0:13:52.195,000 --> 0:13:56,000
They ask for every country to show action and to show progress.

249
0:13:56.371,000 --> 0:13:58,000
How can I, as a private citizen, use the report card

250
0:13:59.383,000 --> 0:14:01,000
to create pressure for action?

251
0:14:02.241,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Michael Green: This is a really important point; it's a big shift in priorities --

252
0:14:06.14,000 --> 0:14:08,000
it's no longer about poor countries and just poverty.

253
0:14:08.643,000 --> 0:14:09,000
It's about every country.

254
0:14:09.882,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And every country is going to have challenges in getting to the Global Goals.

255
0:14:13.536,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Even, I'm sorry to say, Bruno, Switzerland has got to work to do.

256
0:14:16.87,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And so that's why we're going to produce these report cards in 2016

257
0:14:20.264,000 --> 0:14:21,000
for every country in the world.

258
0:14:21.774,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Then we can really see, how are we doing?

259
0:14:23.877,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And it's not going to be rich countries scoring straight A's.

260
0:14:26.782,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And that, then, I think, is to provide a point of focus

261
0:14:29.414,000 --> 0:14:32,000
for people to start demanding action and start demanding progress.

262
0:14:32.894,000 --> 0:14:33,000
BG: Thank you very much.

263
0:14:34.366,000 --> 0:14:37,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.185,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I have a two-year-old daughter named Naya

2
0:00:15.686,000 --> 0:00:16,000
who is under the mistaken impression

3
0:00:17.576,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that this conference is named in honor of her father.

4
0:00:21.163,000 --> 0:00:22,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:22.486,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Who am I to contradict my baby girl?

6
0:00:25.495,000 --> 0:00:28,000
As many of you know, there's something about becoming a parent

7
0:00:29.389,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that concentrates the mind on long-term problems like climate change.

8
0:00:34.404,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It was the birth of my daughter that inspired me

9
0:00:36.893,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to launch this climate organization,

10
0:00:39.471,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in order to counteract the excessive polarization of this issue

11
0:00:43.366,000 --> 0:00:44,000
in the United States,

12
0:00:44.699,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and to find a conservative pathway forward.

13
0:00:49.97,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Yes, folks, a Republican climate solution is possible,

14
0:00:54.627,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and you know what?

15
0:00:55.976,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It may even be better.

16
0:00:58.332,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:59.967,000 --> 0:01:,000
Let me try to prove that to you.

18
0:01:03.089,000 --> 0:01:07,000
What we really need is a killer app to climate policy.

19
0:01:07.687,000 --> 0:01:11,000
In the technology world, a killer app is an application so transformative

20
0:01:12.128,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that it creates its own market,

21
0:01:13.631,000 --> 0:01:14,000
like Uber.

22
0:01:15.22,000 --> 0:01:16,000
In the climate world,

23
0:01:16.871,000 --> 0:01:2,000
a killer app is a new solution so promising

24
0:01:21.82,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that it can break through the seemingly insurmountable

25
0:01:25.391,000 --> 0:01:26,000
barriers to progress.

26
0:01:27.276,000 --> 0:01:3,000
These include the psychological barrier.

27
0:01:30.825,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Climate advocates have long been encouraging their fellow citizens

28
0:01:34.062,000 --> 0:01:35,000
to make short-term sacrifices now

29
0:01:35.996,000 --> 0:01:37,000
for benefits that accrue to other people

30
0:01:38.057,000 --> 0:01:41,000
in other countries 30 or 40 years in the future.

31
0:01:41.425,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It just doesn't fly because it runs contrary to basic human nature.

32
0:01:46.507,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Next is the geopolitical barrier.

33
0:01:49.844,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Under the current rules of global trade,

34
0:01:52.136,000 --> 0:01:56,000
countries have a strong incentive to free ride off the emissions reductions

35
0:01:56.506,000 --> 0:01:57,000
of other nations,

36
0:01:57.789,000 --> 0:01:59,000
instead of strengthening their own programs.

37
0:02:00.045,000 --> 0:02:01,000
This has been the curse

38
0:02:01.627,000 --> 0:02:04,000
of every international climate negotiations, including Paris.

39
0:02:06.243,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Finally, we have the partisan barrier.

40
0:02:09.322,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Even the most committed countries --

41
0:02:11.417,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada --

42
0:02:14.641,000 --> 0:02:18,000
are nowhere near reducing emissions at the required scale and speed.

43
0:02:19.386,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Not even close.

44
0:02:20.878,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And the partisan climate divide is far more acute

45
0:02:25.152,000 --> 0:02:26,000
here in the United States.

46
0:02:27.623,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We are fundamentally stuck,

47
0:02:29.753,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and that is why we need a killer app of climate policy

48
0:02:33.337,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to break through each of these barriers.

49
0:02:36.57,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I'm convinced that the road to climate progress in the United States

50
0:02:42.262,000 --> 0:02:44,000
runs through the Republican Party

51
0:02:44.901,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and the business community.

52
0:02:48.072,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So in launching the Climate Leadership Council,

53
0:02:50.852,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I started by reaching out to a who's who of Republican elder statesmen

54
0:02:54.79,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and business leaders,

55
0:02:56.004,000 --> 0:02:59,000
including James Baker and George Schultz,

56
0:02:59.405,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the two most respected Republican elder statesmen in America;

57
0:03:03.549,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Martin Feldstein and Greg Mankiw,

58
0:03:05.442,000 --> 0:03:08,000
the two most respected conservative economists in the country;

59
0:03:09.108,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and Henry Paulson and Rob Walton,

60
0:03:11.225,000 --> 0:03:13,000
two of the most successful and admired business leaders.

61
0:03:14.218,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Together, we co-authored

62
0:03:16.543,000 --> 0:03:19,000
"The Conservative Case For Carbon Dividends."

63
0:03:19.631,000 --> 0:03:21,000
This represents the first time

64
0:03:22.19,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that Republican leaders put forth

65
0:03:25.805,000 --> 0:03:27,000
a concrete market-based climate solution.

66
0:03:28.342,000 --> 0:03:29,000
(Applause)

67
0:03:29.747,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Thank you.

68
0:03:30.84,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Applause)

69
0:03:33.467,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We presented our plan at the White House

70
0:03:35.818,000 --> 0:03:37,000
two weeks after President Trump moved in.

71
0:03:39.465,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Almost every leading editorial board in the country

72
0:03:43.367,000 --> 0:03:45,000
has since endorsed our plan,

73
0:03:45.638,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and Fortune 100 companies from a wide range of industries

74
0:03:50.347,000 --> 0:03:52,000
are now getting behind it.

75
0:03:52.722,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So by now you're probably wondering,

76
0:03:54.707,000 --> 0:03:56,000
what exactly is this plan?

77
0:03:57.133,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Well, our carbon dividends solution is based on four pillars.

78
0:04:01.525,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The first is a gradually rising carbon tax.

79
0:04:05.459,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Although capitalism is a wonderful system,

80
0:04:08.01,000 --> 0:04:11,000
like many operating systems, it's prone to bugs,

81
0:04:11.209,000 --> 0:04:14,000
which, in this case, are called "market failures."

82
0:04:14.426,000 --> 0:04:17,000
By far the largest is that market prices fail to take

83
0:04:17.972,000 --> 0:04:2,000
social and environmental costs into account.

84
0:04:21.735,000 --> 0:04:26,000
That means every market transaction is based on incorrect information.

85
0:04:27.099,000 --> 0:04:31,000
This fundamental bug of capitalism, more than any other single factor,

86
0:04:31.221,000 --> 0:04:33,000
is to blame for our climate predicament.

87
0:04:34.58,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Now in theory, this should be an easy problem to fix.

88
0:04:37.915,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Economists agree

89
0:04:39.305,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that the best solution is to put a price on the carbon content of fossil fuels,

90
0:04:44.117,000 --> 0:04:46,000
otherwise known as a carbon tax.

91
0:04:46.415,000 --> 0:04:49,000
This would discourage carbon emissions

92
0:04:50.167,000 --> 0:04:52,000
in every single economic transaction,

93
0:04:52.511,000 --> 0:04:53,000
every day of the year.

94
0:04:54.245,000 --> 0:04:59,000
However, a carbon tax by itself has proven to be unpopular

95
0:04:59.615,000 --> 0:05:,000
and a political dead end.

96
0:05:01.813,000 --> 0:05:04,000
The answer is to return all the money raised

97
0:05:05.362,000 --> 0:05:07,000
directly to citizens,

98
0:05:07.678,000 --> 0:05:1,000
in the form of equal monthly dividends.

99
0:05:11.499,000 --> 0:05:14,000
This would transform an unpopular carbon tax

100
0:05:15.055,000 --> 0:05:18,000
into a popular and populist solution,

101
0:05:18.321,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and it would also solve

102
0:05:20.169,000 --> 0:05:23,000
the underlying psychological barrier that we discussed,

103
0:05:23.506,000 --> 0:05:27,000
by giving everyone a concrete benefit in the here and now.

104
0:05:29.127,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And these benefits would be significant.

105
0:05:31.44,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Assuming a carbon tax rate that starts at 40 dollars per ton,

106
0:05:35.206,000 --> 0:05:38,000
a family of four would receive 2,000 dollars per year

107
0:05:38.653,000 --> 0:05:39,000
from the get-go.

108
0:05:40.463,000 --> 0:05:42,000
According to the US Treasury Department,

109
0:05:43.459,000 --> 0:05:48,000
the bottom 70 percent of Americans would receive more in dividends

110
0:05:48.513,000 --> 0:05:51,000
than they would pay in increased energy prices.

111
0:05:51.828,000 --> 0:05:57,000
That means 223 million Americans would win economically

112
0:05:58.845,000 --> 0:06:,000
from solving climate change.

113
0:06:01.631,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And that --

114
0:06:02.817,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Applause)

115
0:06:03.896,000 --> 0:06:04,000
is revolutionary,

116
0:06:05.47,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and could fundamentally alter climate politics.

117
0:06:10.598,000 --> 0:06:12,000
But there's another revolutionary element here.

118
0:06:13.439,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The amount of the dividend would grow

119
0:06:16.943,000 --> 0:06:18,000
as the carbon tax rate increases.

120
0:06:19.328,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The more we protect our climate,

121
0:06:21.428,000 --> 0:06:22,000
the more our citizens benefit.

122
0:06:23.307,000 --> 0:06:25,000
This creates a positive feedback loop,

123
0:06:25.553,000 --> 0:06:26,000
which is crucial,

124
0:06:27.107,000 --> 0:06:3,000
because the only way we will reach our long-term emission-reduction goals

125
0:06:31.027,000 --> 0:06:33,000
is if the carbon tax rate goes up every year.

126
0:06:34.799,000 --> 0:06:37,000
The third pillar of our program is eliminating regulations

127
0:06:38.789,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that are no longer needed

128
0:06:40.352,000 --> 0:06:43,000
once a carbon dividends plan is enacted.

129
0:06:43.454,000 --> 0:06:49,000
This is a key selling point to Republicans and business leaders.

130
0:06:50.919,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So why should we trade

131
0:06:52.986,000 --> 0:06:54,000
climate regulations for a price on carbon?

132
0:06:55.541,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Well, let me show you.

133
0:06:57.996,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Our plan would achieve nearly twice the emissions reductions

134
0:07:02.448,000 --> 0:07:06,000
of all Obama-era climate regulations combined,

135
0:07:06.628,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and nearly three times the new baseline

136
0:07:10.262,000 --> 0:07:14,000
after President Trump repeals all of those regulations.

137
0:07:14.443,000 --> 0:07:17,000
That assumes a carbon tax starting at 40 dollars per ton,

138
0:07:18.23,000 --> 0:07:22,000
which translates into roughly an extra 36 cents per gallon of gas.

139
0:07:23.882,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Our plan by itself

140
0:07:26.415,000 --> 0:07:29,000
would meet the high end of America's commitment

141
0:07:30.012,000 --> 0:07:32,000
under the Paris Climate Agreement,

142
0:07:32.314,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and as you can see,

143
0:07:34.012,000 --> 0:07:36,000
the emissions reductions would continue over time.

144
0:07:37.521,000 --> 0:07:42,000
This illustrates the power of a conservative climate solution

145
0:07:43.113,000 --> 0:07:45,000
based on free markets and limited government.

146
0:07:46.025,000 --> 0:07:49,000
We would end up with less regulation

147
0:07:49.228,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and far less pollution at the same time,

148
0:07:52.344,000 --> 0:07:55,000
while helping working-class Americans get ahead.

149
0:07:56.352,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Doesn't that sound like something we could all support?

150
0:07:59.614,000 --> 0:08:01,000
(Applause)

151
0:08:05.723,000 --> 0:08:09,000
The fourth and final pillar of our program is a new climate domino effect,

152
0:08:10.266,000 --> 0:08:12,000
based on border carbon adjustments.

153
0:08:12.944,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Now that may sound complicated,

154
0:08:15.071,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but it, too, is revolutionary,

155
0:08:16.96,000 --> 0:08:18,000
because it provides us a whole new strategy

156
0:08:19.845,000 --> 0:08:21,000
to reach a global price on carbon,

157
0:08:22.417,000 --> 0:08:23,000
which is ultimately what we need.

158
0:08:24.308,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Let me show you an example.

159
0:08:26.264,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Suppose Country A adopts a carbon dividends plan,

160
0:08:29.789,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and Country B does not.

161
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Well, to level the playing field

162
0:08:33.687,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and protect the competitiveness of its industries,

163
0:08:36.946,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Country A would tax imports from Country B

164
0:08:40.868,000 --> 0:08:41,000
based on their carbon content.

165
0:08:42.731,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Fair enough.

166
0:08:44.272,000 --> 0:08:46,000
But here's where it gets really interesting,

167
0:08:46.44,000 --> 0:08:49,000
because the money raised at the border would increase the dividends

168
0:08:50.102,000 --> 0:08:52,000
going to the citizens of Country A.

169
0:08:52.38,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Well, how long do you think it would take the public in Country B to realize

170
0:08:56.576,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that that money should be going to them,

171
0:08:58.533,000 --> 0:09:,000
and to push for a carbon dividends plan in their own land?

172
0:09:01.546,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Add a few more countries,

173
0:09:03.069,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and we get a new climate domino effect.

174
0:09:07.337,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Once one major country or region adopts carbon dividends

175
0:09:11.65,000 --> 0:09:12,000
with border carbon adjustments,

176
0:09:13.299,000 --> 0:09:15,000
other countries are compelled to follow suit.

177
0:09:15.782,000 --> 0:09:17,000
One by one the dominoes fall.

178
0:09:18.718,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And this domino effect could start anywhere.

179
0:09:21.071,000 --> 0:09:24,000
My preference, strongly, is the United States,

180
0:09:24.505,000 --> 0:09:26,000
but it could also start in the United Kingdom,

181
0:09:27.056,000 --> 0:09:29,000
in Germany or another European country,

182
0:09:29.288,000 --> 0:09:3,000
or even in China.

183
0:09:31.832,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Let's take China as an example.

184
0:09:33.866,000 --> 0:09:37,000
China is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions,

185
0:09:38.434,000 --> 0:09:4,000
but what its leaders care even more about

186
0:09:40.799,000 --> 0:09:44,000
is transitioning their economy to consumer-led economic development.

187
0:09:45.8,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Well, nothing could do more to hasten that transition

188
0:09:48.7,000 --> 0:09:51,000
than giving every Chinese citizen a monthly dividend.

189
0:09:52.003,000 --> 0:09:55,000
In fact, this is the only policy solution

190
0:09:55.548,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that would enable China to meet its environmental and economic goals

191
0:09:59.214,000 --> 0:10:,000
at the same time.

192
0:10:00.596,000 --> 0:10:03,000
That's why this is the killer app of climate policy,

193
0:10:03.997,000 --> 0:10:06,000
because it would enable us to overcome

194
0:10:07.36,000 --> 0:10:09,000
each of the barriers we discussed earlier:

195
0:10:09.697,000 --> 0:10:12,000
the psychological barrier, the partisan barrier,

196
0:10:12.805,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and, as we've just seen, the geopolitical barrier.

197
0:10:16.289,000 --> 0:10:19,000
All we need is a country to lead the way.

198
0:10:20.291,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And one method of finding what you're looking for

199
0:10:22.744,000 --> 0:10:23,000
is to take out an ad.

200
0:10:24.428,000 --> 0:10:25,000
So let's read this one together.

201
0:10:26.431,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Wanted: country to pioneer carbon dividends plan.

202
0:10:30.265,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Cost to country: zero.

203
0:10:32.732,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Starting date: as soon as possible.

204
0:10:35.035,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Advantages: most effective climate solution,

205
0:10:38.501,000 --> 0:10:39,000
popular and populist,

206
0:10:40.282,000 --> 0:10:41,000
pro-growth and pro-business,

207
0:10:42.148,000 --> 0:10:45,000
shrinks government and helps the working class.

208
0:10:47.101,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Additional compensation: gratitude of current and future generations,

209
0:10:53.458,000 --> 0:10:55,000
including my daughter.

210
0:10:56.031,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Thank you.

211
0:10:57.207,000 --> 0:11:04,000
(Applause)

212
0:11:04.461,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Chris Anderson: Just one question for you, Ted.

213
0:11:09.221,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I'm actually not sure

214
0:11:10.396,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I've seen a conservative get a standing O at TED before that.

215
0:11:13.317,000 --> 0:11:14,000
That's pretty cool.

216
0:11:15.554,000 --> 0:11:16,000
The logic seems really powerful,

217
0:11:17.404,000 --> 0:11:19,000
but some people you talk to in politics

218
0:11:19.498,000 --> 0:11:23,000
say it's hard to imagine this still getting through Congress.

219
0:11:23.593,000 --> 0:11:25,000
How are you feeling about momentum behind this?

220
0:11:26.132,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Ted Halstead: So I understand that many are very pessimistic

221
0:11:29.781,000 --> 0:11:32,000
about what's happening in the United States with President Trump.

222
0:11:32.854,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I'm less pessimistic; here's why.

223
0:11:34.457,000 --> 0:11:37,000
The actions of this White House, the early actions on climate,

224
0:11:37.487,000 --> 0:11:42,000
are just the first move in a complex game of climate chess.

225
0:11:43.09,000 --> 0:11:45,000
So far it's been a repeal-only strategy;

226
0:11:45.725,000 --> 0:11:47,000
the pressure is going to mount for a replacement program,

227
0:11:48.599,000 --> 0:11:49,000
which is where we come in.

228
0:11:49.869,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And there are three reasons why, which I'll go through real quickly.

229
0:11:53.091,000 --> 0:11:56,000
One, the business community is fundamentally parting ways

230
0:11:56.328,000 --> 0:11:58,000
with the White House on climate change.

231
0:11:58.788,000 --> 0:11:59,000
In fact, we're finding

232
0:11:59.963,000 --> 0:12:02,000
a number of Fortune 100 companies supporting our program.

233
0:12:03.098,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Within two months, we're going to be announcing

234
0:12:05.321,000 --> 0:12:08,000
some really surprising names coming out in favor of this program.

235
0:12:08.4,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Two, there is no issue in American politics

236
0:12:11.557,000 --> 0:12:14,000
where there's a more fundamental gap between the Republican base

237
0:12:15.391,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and the Republican leadership than climate change.

238
0:12:18.05,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And three, thinking of this analogy of chess,

239
0:12:23.225,000 --> 0:12:27,000
the big decision up ahead is: Does the administration stay in Paris?

240
0:12:27.478,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Well, let's pan it out both ways.

241
0:12:29.129,000 --> 0:12:32,000
If it stays in Paris, as many are pushing for in the administration,

242
0:12:32.946,000 --> 0:12:34,000
well then that begs a question: What's the plan?

243
0:12:35.565,000 --> 0:12:36,000
We have the plan.

244
0:12:37.049,000 --> 0:12:39,000
But if they don't stay in Paris,

245
0:12:39.144,000 --> 0:12:41,000
the international pressure will be overwhelming.

246
0:12:41.62,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Our Secretary of State will be asking other countries for NATO contributions,

247
0:12:45.271,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and they'll be saying, "No, give us our Paris commitment.

248
0:12:48.197,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Come through on your commitments, we'll come through on ours."

249
0:12:51.133,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So, international, business and even the Republican base

250
0:12:54.451,000 --> 0:12:57,000
will all be calling for a Republican replacement plan.

251
0:12:58.397,000 --> 0:13:,000
And, hopefully, we've provided one.

252
0:13:01.351,000 --> 0:13:02,000
CA: Thank you so much, Ted.

253
0:13:02.662,000 --> 0:13:03,000
TH: Thank you, Chris.

254
0:13:03.837,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Applause)

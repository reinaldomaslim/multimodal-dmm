1
0:00:12.658,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So I've had the great privilege

2
0:00:14.738,000 --> 0:00:16,000
of traveling to some incredible places,

3
0:00:17.178,000 --> 0:00:21,000
photographing these distant landscapes and remote cultures

4
0:00:21.436,000 --> 0:00:22,000
all over the world.

5
0:00:22.886,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I love my job.

6
0:00:24.32,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But people think it's this string of epiphanies

7
0:00:26.909,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and sunrises and rainbows,

8
0:00:29.422,000 --> 0:00:31,000
when in reality, it looks more something like this.

9
0:00:32.21,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:33.456,000 --> 0:00:34,000
This is my office.

11
0:00:35.473,000 --> 0:00:37,000
We can't afford the fanciest places to stay at night,

12
0:00:38.128,000 --> 0:00:4,000
so we tend to sleep a lot outdoors.

13
0:00:41.365,000 --> 0:00:42,000
As long as we can stay dry,

14
0:00:42.818,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that's a bonus.

15
0:00:44.243,000 --> 0:00:46,000
We also can't afford the fanciest restaurants.

16
0:00:46.672,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So we tend to eat whatever's on the local menu.

17
0:00:50.045,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And if you're in the Ecuadorian Páramo,

18
0:00:53.141,000 --> 0:00:55,000
you're going to eat a large rodent called a cuy.

19
0:00:55.927,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Laughter)

20
0:00:57.568,000 --> 0:01:,000
But what makes our experiences perhaps a little bit different

21
0:01:01.21,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and a little more unique than that of the average person

22
0:01:03.956,000 --> 0:01:06,000
is that we have this gnawing thing in the back of our mind

23
0:01:07.436,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that even in our darkest moments, and those times of despair,

24
0:01:11.377,000 --> 0:01:14,000
we think, "Hey, there might be an image to be made here,

25
0:01:15.303,000 --> 0:01:17,000
there might be a story to be told."

26
0:01:18.164,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And why is storytelling important?

27
0:01:20.509,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Well, it helps us to connect with our cultural and our natural heritage.

28
0:01:25.063,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And in the Southeast,

29
0:01:26.246,000 --> 0:01:29,000
there's an alarming disconnect between the public

30
0:01:29.328,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and the natural areas that allow us to be here in the first place.

31
0:01:33.77,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We're visual creatures,

32
0:01:35.999,000 --> 0:01:38,000
so we use what we see to teach us what we know.

33
0:01:39.773,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Now the majority of us aren't going to willingly go

34
0:01:42.195,000 --> 0:01:43,000
way down to a swamp.

35
0:01:44.638,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So how can we still expect those same people to then advocate

36
0:01:48.256,000 --> 0:01:49,000
on behalf of their protection?

37
0:01:50.41,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We can't.

38
0:01:51.608,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So my job, then, is to use photography as a communication tool,

39
0:01:55.877,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to help bridge the gap between the science and the aesthetics,

40
0:01:59.876,000 --> 0:02:,000
to get people talking,

41
0:02:01.518,000 --> 0:02:02,000
to get them thinking,

42
0:02:02.911,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and to hopefully, ultimately,

43
0:02:04.592,000 --> 0:02:05,000
get them caring.

44
0:02:06.841,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I started doing this 15 years ago right here in Gainesville,

45
0:02:09.775,000 --> 0:02:1,000
right here in my backyard.

46
0:02:11.674,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And I fell in love with adventure and discovery,

47
0:02:14.546,000 --> 0:02:16,000
going to explore all these different places

48
0:02:16.627,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that were just minutes from my front doorstep.

49
0:02:18.944,000 --> 0:02:2,000
There are a lot of beautiful places to find.

50
0:02:21.872,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Despite all these years that have passed,

51
0:02:24.198,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I still see the world through the eyes of a child

52
0:02:26.516,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and I try to incorporate that sense of wonderment

53
0:02:29.393,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and that sense of curiosity into my photography

54
0:02:34.098,000 --> 0:02:35,000
as often as I can.

55
0:02:37.006,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And we're pretty lucky because here in the South,

56
0:02:39.328,000 --> 0:02:42,000
we're still blessed with a relatively blank canvas

57
0:02:42.424,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that we can fill with the most fanciful adventures

58
0:02:45.632,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and incredible experiences.

59
0:02:48.103,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It's just a matter of how far our imagination will take us.

60
0:02:52.402,000 --> 0:02:54,000
See, a lot of people look at this and they say,

61
0:02:54.625,000 --> 0:02:55,000
"Oh yeah, wow, that's a pretty tree."

62
0:02:56.427,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But I don't just see a tree --

63
0:02:57.922,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I look at this and I see opportunity.

64
0:03:00.525,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I see an entire weekend.

65
0:03:03.122,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Because when I was a kid, these were the types of images

66
0:03:05.783,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that got me off the sofa and dared me to explore,

67
0:03:08.275,000 --> 0:03:09,000
dared me to go find the woods

68
0:03:09.74,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and put my head underwater and see what we have.

69
0:03:13.433,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And folks, I've been photographing all over the world

70
0:03:16.258,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and I promise you,

71
0:03:17.623,000 --> 0:03:18,000
what we have here in the South,

72
0:03:19.142,000 --> 0:03:2,000
what we have in the Sunshine State,

73
0:03:20.847,000 --> 0:03:22,000
rivals anything else that I've seen.

74
0:03:23.943,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But yet our tourism industry is busy promoting all the wrong things.

75
0:03:28.698,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Before most kids are 12, they'll have been to Disney World

76
0:03:31.453,000 --> 0:03:32,000
more times than they've been in a canoe

77
0:03:33.438,000 --> 0:03:35,000
or camping under a starry sky.

78
0:03:36.816,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And I have nothing against Disney or Mickey; I used to go there, too.

79
0:03:40.387,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But they're missing out on those fundamental connections

80
0:03:43.07,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that create a real sense of pride and ownership

81
0:03:46.316,000 --> 0:03:48,000
for the place that they call home.

82
0:03:49.251,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And this is compounded by the issue that the landscapes

83
0:03:52.314,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that define our natural heritage

84
0:03:54.447,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and fuel our aquifer for our drinking water

85
0:03:57.447,000 --> 0:04:01,000
have been deemed as scary and dangerous and spooky.

86
0:04:02.329,000 --> 0:04:03,000
When our ancestors first came here,

87
0:04:04.106,000 --> 0:04:06,000
they warned, "Stay out of these areas, they're haunted.

88
0:04:06.766,000 --> 0:04:09,000
They're full of evil spirits and ghosts."

89
0:04:09.887,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I don't know where they came up with that idea.

90
0:04:12.804,000 --> 0:04:14,000
But it's actually led to a very real disconnect,

91
0:04:15.46,000 --> 0:04:16,000
a very real negative mentality

92
0:04:17.245,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that has kept the public disinterested, silent,

93
0:04:20.847,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and ultimately, our environment at risk.

94
0:04:24.523,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We're a state that's surrounded and defined by water,

95
0:04:27.999,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and yet for centuries,

96
0:04:29.299,000 --> 0:04:3,000
swamps and wetlands have been regarded

97
0:04:31.216,000 --> 0:04:33,000
as these obstacles to overcome.

98
0:04:34.367,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And so we've treated them as these second-class ecosystems,

99
0:04:38.373,000 --> 0:04:4,000
because they have very little monetary value

100
0:04:40.661,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and of course, they're known to harbor alligators and snakes --

101
0:04:44.37,000 --> 0:04:47,000
which, I'll admit, these aren't the most cuddly of ambassadors.

102
0:04:47.692,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Laughter)

103
0:04:48.852,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So it became assumed, then, that the only good swamp

104
0:04:51.654,000 --> 0:04:52,000
was a drained swamp.

105
0:04:53.364,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And in fact,

106
0:04:54.539,000 --> 0:04:57,000
draining a swamp to make way for agriculture and development

107
0:04:57.974,000 --> 0:05:,000
was considered the very essence of conservation not too long ago.

108
0:05:02.522,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But now we're backpedaling,

109
0:05:04.092,000 --> 0:05:07,000
because the more we come to learn about these sodden landscapes,

110
0:05:07.467,000 --> 0:05:08,000
the more secrets we're starting to unlock

111
0:05:09.457,000 --> 0:05:11,000
about interspecies relationships

112
0:05:11.844,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and the connectivity of habitats, watersheds and flyways.

113
0:05:17.04,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Take this bird, for example:

114
0:05:19.049,000 --> 0:05:2,000
this is the prothonotary warbler.

115
0:05:20.961,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I love this bird because it's a swamp bird,

116
0:05:23.171,000 --> 0:05:24,000
through and through, a swamp bird.

117
0:05:24.899,000 --> 0:05:27,000
They nest and they mate and they breed in these old-growth swamps

118
0:05:28.571,000 --> 0:05:29,000
in these flooded forests.

119
0:05:30.059,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And so after the spring, after they raise their young,

120
0:05:32.631,000 --> 0:05:34,000
they then fly thousand of miles over the Gulf of Mexico

121
0:05:35.46,000 --> 0:05:36,000
into Central and South America.

122
0:05:37.806,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And then after the winter,

123
0:05:39.082,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the spring rolls around and they come back.

124
0:05:41.121,000 --> 0:05:43,000
They fly thousands of miles over the Gulf of Mexico.

125
0:05:44.044,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And where do they go? Where do they land?

126
0:05:47.474,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Right back in the same tree.

127
0:05:50.686,000 --> 0:05:51,000
That's nuts.

128
0:05:52.151,000 --> 0:05:55,000
This is a bird the size of a tennis ball --

129
0:05:55.522,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I mean, that's crazy!

130
0:05:57.223,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I used a GPS to get here today,

131
0:05:59.797,000 --> 0:06:,000
and this is my hometown.

132
0:06:01.488,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Laughter)

133
0:06:02.783,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It's crazy.

134
0:06:04.374,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So what happens, then, when this bird flies over the Gulf of Mexico

135
0:06:08.088,000 --> 0:06:09,000
into Central America for the winter

136
0:06:09.98,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and then the spring rolls around and it flies back,

137
0:06:12.445,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and it comes back to this:

138
0:06:15.236,000 --> 0:06:16,000
a freshly sodded golf course?

139
0:06:17.942,000 --> 0:06:19,000
This is a narrative that's all too commonly unraveling

140
0:06:20.555,000 --> 0:06:21,000
here in this state.

141
0:06:21.766,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And this is a natural process that's occurred for thousands of years

142
0:06:25.029,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and we're just now learning about it.

143
0:06:26.831,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So you can imagine all else we have to learn about these landscapes

144
0:06:30.018,000 --> 0:06:31,000
if we just preserve them first.

145
0:06:31.9,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Now despite all this rich life that abounds in these swamps,

146
0:06:36.455,000 --> 0:06:37,000
they still have a bad name.

147
0:06:38.828,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Many people feel uncomfortable with the idea of wading

148
0:06:42.518,000 --> 0:06:43,000
into Florida's blackwater.

149
0:06:44.206,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I can understand that.

150
0:06:46.019,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But what I loved about growing up in the Sunshine State

151
0:06:49.184,000 --> 0:06:5,000
is that for so many of us,

152
0:06:50.49,000 --> 0:06:53,000
we live with this latent but very palpable fear

153
0:06:54.303,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that when we put our toes into the water,

154
0:06:56.668,000 --> 0:06:58,000
there might be something much more ancient

155
0:06:59.674,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and much more adapted than we are.

156
0:07:02.664,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Knowing that you're not top dog is a welcomed discomfort, I think.

157
0:07:08.082,000 --> 0:07:11,000
How often in this modern and urban and digital age

158
0:07:11.992,000 --> 0:07:14,000
do you actually get the chance to feel vulnerable,

159
0:07:15.66,000 --> 0:07:19,000
or consider that the world may not have been made for just us?

160
0:07:19.85,000 --> 0:07:2,000
So for the last decade,

161
0:07:21.156,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I began seeking out these areas where the concrete yields to forest

162
0:07:24.575,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and the pines turn to cypress,

163
0:07:26.777,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and I viewed all these mosquitoes and reptiles,

164
0:07:30.446,000 --> 0:07:31,000
all these discomforts,

165
0:07:31.969,000 --> 0:07:34,000
as affirmations that I'd found true wilderness,

166
0:07:35.525,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and I embrace them wholly.

167
0:07:37.709,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Now as a conservation photographer obsessed with blackwater,

168
0:07:41.136,000 --> 0:07:43,000
it's only fitting that I'd eventually end up

169
0:07:43.28,000 --> 0:07:45,000
in the most famous swamp of all:

170
0:07:45.481,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the Everglades.

171
0:07:47.144,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Growing up here in North Central Florida,

172
0:07:49.137,000 --> 0:07:5,000
it always had these enchanted names,

173
0:07:50.891,000 --> 0:07:53,000
places like Loxahatchee and Fakahatchee,

174
0:07:54.257,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Corkscrew, Big Cypress.

175
0:07:56.403,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I started what turned into a five-year project

176
0:07:59.967,000 --> 0:08:02,000
to hopefully reintroduce the Everglades in a new light,

177
0:08:03.741,000 --> 0:08:04,000
in a more inspired light.

178
0:08:05.922,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But I knew this would be a tall order, because here you have an area

179
0:08:09.171,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that's roughly a third the size the state of Florida, it's huge.

180
0:08:12.224,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And when I say Everglades,

181
0:08:13.525,000 --> 0:08:15,000
most people are like, "Oh, yeah, the national park."

182
0:08:16.017,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But the Everglades is not just a park; it's an entire watershed,

183
0:08:21.054,000 --> 0:08:24,000
starting with the Kissimmee chain of lakes in the north,

184
0:08:24.083,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and then as the rains would fall in the summer,

185
0:08:26.332,000 --> 0:08:28,000
these downpours would flow into Lake Okeechobee,

186
0:08:28.988,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and Lake Okeechobee would fill up and it would overflow its banks

187
0:08:32.259,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and spill southward, ever slowly, with the topography,

188
0:08:35.557,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and get into the river of grass, the Sawgrass Prairies,

189
0:08:38.177,000 --> 0:08:4,000
before meting into the cypress slews,

190
0:08:40.246,000 --> 0:08:42,000
until going further south into the mangrove swamps,

191
0:08:42.957,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and then finally -- finally -- reaching Florida Bay,

192
0:08:46.731,000 --> 0:08:47,000
the emerald gem of the Everglades,

193
0:08:48.528,000 --> 0:08:49,000
the great estuary,

194
0:08:49.735,000 --> 0:08:51,000
the 850 square-mile estuary.

195
0:08:52.464,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So sure, the national park is the southern end of this system,

196
0:08:56.821,000 --> 0:08:59,000
but all the things that make it unique are these inputs that come in,

197
0:09:00.148,000 --> 0:09:02,000
the fresh water that starts 100 miles north.

198
0:09:02.979,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So no manner of these political or invisible boundaries

199
0:09:06.268,000 --> 0:09:1,000
protect the park from polluted water or insufficient water.

200
0:09:11.242,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And unfortunately, that's precisely what we've done.

201
0:09:14.63,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Over the last 60 years,

202
0:09:16.187,000 --> 0:09:19,000
we have drained, we have dammed, we have dredged the Everglades

203
0:09:19.568,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to where now only one third of the water that used to reach the bay

204
0:09:23.573,000 --> 0:09:25,000
now reaches the bay today.

205
0:09:26.586,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So this story is not all sunshine and rainbows, unfortunately.

206
0:09:30.953,000 --> 0:09:31,000
For better or for worse,

207
0:09:32.863,000 --> 0:09:35,000
the story of the Everglades is intrinsically tied

208
0:09:36.304,000 --> 0:09:39,000
to the peaks and the valleys of mankind's relationship

209
0:09:39.524,000 --> 0:09:4,000
with the natural world.

210
0:09:41.255,000 --> 0:09:43,000
But I'll show you these beautiful pictures,

211
0:09:43.304,000 --> 0:09:44,000
because it gets you on board.

212
0:09:44.789,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And while I have your attention, I can tell you the real story.

213
0:09:47.941,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It's that we're taking this,

214
0:09:49.916,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and we're trading it for this,

215
0:09:52.903,000 --> 0:09:53,000
at an alarming rate.

216
0:09:55.358,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And what's lost on so many people

217
0:09:57.092,000 --> 0:09:59,000
is the sheer scale of which we're discussing.

218
0:09:59.627,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Because the Everglades is not just responsible for the drinking water

219
0:10:03.079,000 --> 0:10:05,000
for 7 million Floridians;

220
0:10:05.307,000 --> 0:10:07,000
today it also provides the agricultural fields

221
0:10:07.869,000 --> 0:10:09,000
for the year-round tomatoes and oranges

222
0:10:10.452,000 --> 0:10:12,000
for over 300 million Americans.

223
0:10:14.391,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And it's that same seasonal pulse of water in the summer

224
0:10:17.729,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that built the river of grass 6,000 years ago.

225
0:10:22.284,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Ironically, today, it's also responsible for the over half a million acres

226
0:10:26.686,000 --> 0:10:28,000
of the endless river of sugarcane.

227
0:10:29.899,000 --> 0:10:31,000
These are the same fields that are responsible

228
0:10:32.092,000 --> 0:10:36,000
for dumping exceedingly high levels of fertilizers into the watershed,

229
0:10:36.14,000 --> 0:10:38,000
forever changing the system.

230
0:10:38.749,000 --> 0:10:41,000
But in order for you to not just understand how this system works,

231
0:10:41.985,000 --> 0:10:43,000
but to also get personally connected to it,

232
0:10:44.072,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I decided to break the story down into several different narratives.

233
0:10:47.371,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And I wanted that story to start in Lake Okeechobee,

234
0:10:50.183,000 --> 0:10:52,000
the beating heart of the Everglade system.

235
0:10:52.954,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And to do that, I picked an ambassador,

236
0:10:55.441,000 --> 0:10:56,000
an iconic species.

237
0:10:57.204,000 --> 0:10:58,000
This is the Everglade snail kite.

238
0:10:59.72,000 --> 0:11:,000
It's a great bird,

239
0:11:00.99,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and they used to nest in the thousands,

240
0:11:02.888,000 --> 0:11:03,000
thousands in the northern Everglades.

241
0:11:04.715,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And then they've gone down to about 400 nesting pairs today.

242
0:11:08.243,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And why is that?

243
0:11:09.612,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Well, it's because they eat one source of food, an apple snail,

244
0:11:12.76,000 --> 0:11:15,000
about the size of a ping-pong ball, an aquatic gastropod.

245
0:11:16.185,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So as we started damming up the Everglades,

246
0:11:19.434,000 --> 0:11:22,000
as we started diking Lake Okeechobee and draining the wetlands,

247
0:11:22.935,000 --> 0:11:24,000
we lost the habitat for the snail.

248
0:11:25.071,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And thus, the population of the kites declined.

249
0:11:28.454,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And so, I wanted a photo that would not only communicate this relationship

250
0:11:31.974,000 --> 0:11:34,000
between wetland, snail and bird,

251
0:11:35.087,000 --> 0:11:37,000
but I also wanted a photo that would communicate

252
0:11:37.36,000 --> 0:11:39,000
how incredible this relationship was,

253
0:11:40.178,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and how very important it is that they've come to depend on each other,

254
0:11:44.358,000 --> 0:11:45,000
this healthy wetland and this bird.

255
0:11:46.049,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And to do that, I brainstormed this idea.

256
0:11:48.045,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I started sketching out these plans to make a photo,

257
0:11:51.307,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and I sent it to the wildlife biologist down in Okeechobee --

258
0:11:54.218,000 --> 0:11:57,000
this is an endangered bird, so it takes special permission to do.

259
0:11:57.329,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So I built this submerged platform

260
0:11:59.047,000 --> 0:12:01,000
that would hold snails just right under the water.

261
0:12:01.553,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And I spent months planning this crazy idea.

262
0:12:06.035,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And I took this platform down to Lake Okeechobee

263
0:12:09.035,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and I spent over a week in the water,

264
0:12:11.131,000 --> 0:12:14,000
wading waist-deep, 9-hour shifts from dawn until dusk,

265
0:12:14.871,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to get one image that I thought might communicate this.

266
0:12:18.055,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And here's the day that it finally worked:

267
0:12:20.294,000 --> 0:12:22,000
[Video: (Mac Stone narrating) After setting up the platform,

268
0:12:23.175,000 --> 0:12:25,000
I look off and I see a kite coming over the cattails.

269
0:12:25.736,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And I see him scanning and searching.

270
0:12:27.682,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And he gets right over the trap,

271
0:12:29.311,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and I see that he's seen it.

272
0:12:30.856,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And he beelines, he goes straight for the trap.

273
0:12:33.603,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And in that moment, all those months of planning, waiting,

274
0:12:36.783,000 --> 0:12:38,000
all the sunburn, mosquito bites --

275
0:12:38.917,000 --> 0:12:4,000
suddenly, they're all worth it.

276
0:12:41.479,000 --> 0:12:44,000
(Mac Stone in film) Oh my gosh, I can't believe it!]

277
0:12:45.695,000 --> 0:12:47,000
You can believe how excited I was when that happened.

278
0:12:48.316,000 --> 0:12:49,000
But what the idea was,

279
0:12:49.68,000 --> 0:12:51,000
is that for someone who's never seen this bird

280
0:12:51.903,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and has no reason to care about it,

281
0:12:53.997,000 --> 0:12:55,000
these photos, these new perspectives,

282
0:12:56.646,000 --> 0:12:59,000
will help shed a little new light on just one species

283
0:12:59.792,000 --> 0:13:03,000
that makes this watershed so incredible, so valuable, so important.

284
0:13:04.615,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Now, I know I can't come here to Gainesville

285
0:13:07.562,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and talk to you about animals in the Everglades

286
0:13:09.832,000 --> 0:13:1,000
without talking about gators.

287
0:13:11.644,000 --> 0:13:13,000
I love gators, I grew up loving gators.

288
0:13:14.361,000 --> 0:13:17,000
My parents always said I had an unhealthy relationship with gators.

289
0:13:17.801,000 --> 0:13:18,000
But what I like about them is,

290
0:13:19.293,000 --> 0:13:21,000
they're like the freshwater equivalent of sharks.

291
0:13:21.921,000 --> 0:13:22,000
They're feared, they're hated,

292
0:13:23.593,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and they are tragically misunderstood.

293
0:13:26.386,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Because these are a unique species, they're not just apex predators.

294
0:13:30.174,000 --> 0:13:31,000
In the Everglades,

295
0:13:31.488,000 --> 0:13:33,000
they are the very architects of the Everglades,

296
0:13:34.006,000 --> 0:13:36,000
because as the water drops down in the winter

297
0:13:36.173,000 --> 0:13:37,000
during the dry season,

298
0:13:37.355,000 --> 0:13:4,000
they start excavating these holes called gator holes.

299
0:13:40.401,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And they do this because as the water drops down,

300
0:13:42.735,000 --> 0:13:45,000
they'll be able to stay wet and they'll be able to forage.

301
0:13:46.645,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And now this isn't just affecting them,

302
0:13:48.988,000 --> 0:13:5,000
other animals also depend on this relationship,

303
0:13:51.245,000 --> 0:13:53,000
so they become a keystone species as well.

304
0:13:54.677,000 --> 0:13:58,000
So how do you make an apex predator, an ancient reptile,

305
0:13:58.936,000 --> 0:14:,000
at once look like it dominates the system,

306
0:14:01.438,000 --> 0:14:03,000
but at the same time, look vulnerable?

307
0:14:04.706,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Well, you wade into a pit of about 120 of them,

308
0:14:08.773,000 --> 0:14:1,000
then you hope that you've made the right decision.

309
0:14:11.203,000 --> 0:14:12,000
(Laughter)

310
0:14:13.955,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I still have all my fingers, it's cool.

311
0:14:16.677,000 --> 0:14:18,000
But I understand, I know I'm not going to rally you guys,

312
0:14:19.403,000 --> 0:14:22,000
I'm not going to rally the troops to "Save the Everglades for the gators!"

313
0:14:23.037,000 --> 0:14:25,000
It won't happen because they're so ubiquitous,

314
0:14:25.259,000 --> 0:14:26,000
we see them now,

315
0:14:26.434,000 --> 0:14:29,000
they're one of the great conservation success stories of the US.

316
0:14:29.8,000 --> 0:14:32,000
But there is one species in the Everglades that no matter who you are,

317
0:14:33.15,000 --> 0:14:36,000
you can't help but love, too, and that's the roseate spoonbill.

318
0:14:36.253,000 --> 0:14:39,000
These birds are great, but they've had a really tough time in the Everglades,

319
0:14:39.908,000 --> 0:14:42,000
because they started out with thousands of nesting pairs in Florida Bay,

320
0:14:43.398,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and at the turn of the 20th century,

321
0:14:45.485,000 --> 0:14:48,000
they got down to two -- two nesting pairs.

322
0:14:49.101,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And why?

323
0:14:50.681,000 --> 0:14:52,000
That's because women thought they looked better on their hats

324
0:14:53.601,000 --> 0:14:55,000
then they did flying in the sky.

325
0:14:56.324,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Then we banned the plume trade,

326
0:14:58.757,000 --> 0:15:,000
and their numbers started rebounding.

327
0:15:00.899,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And as their numbers started rebounding,

328
0:15:02.948,000 --> 0:15:03,000
scientists began to pay attention,

329
0:15:04.711,000 --> 0:15:05,000
they started studying these birds.

330
0:15:06.448,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And what they found out is that

331
0:15:07.957,000 --> 0:15:09,000
these birds' behavior is intrinsically tied

332
0:15:10.139,000 --> 0:15:12,000
to the annual draw-down cycle of water in the Everglades,

333
0:15:13.081,000 --> 0:15:15,000
the thing that defines the Everglades watershed.

334
0:15:16.291,000 --> 0:15:17,000
What they found out is that

335
0:15:17.852,000 --> 0:15:2,000
these birds started nesting in the winter as the water drew down,

336
0:15:20.944,000 --> 0:15:23,000
because they're tactile feeders, so they have to touch whatever they eat.

337
0:15:24.548,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And so they wait for these concentrated pools of fish

338
0:15:27.67,000 --> 0:15:29,000
to be able to feed enough to feed their young.

339
0:15:30.877,000 --> 0:15:32,000
So these birds became the very icon of the Everglades --

340
0:15:33.89,000 --> 0:15:36,000
an indicator species of the overall health of the system.

341
0:15:37.406,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And just as their numbers were rebounding in the mid-20th century --

342
0:15:40.637,000 --> 0:15:44,000
shooting up to 900, 1,000, 1,100, 1,200 --

343
0:15:45.31,000 --> 0:15:48,000
just as that started happening, we started draining the southern Everglades.

344
0:15:49.09,000 --> 0:15:52,000
And we stopped two-thirds of that water from moving south.

345
0:15:52.618,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And it had drastic consequences.

346
0:15:55.584,000 --> 0:15:57,000
And just as those numbers started reaching their peak,

347
0:15:58.222,000 --> 0:16:01,000
unfortunately, today, the real spoonbill story,

348
0:16:01.319,000 --> 0:16:05,000
the real photo of what it looks like is more something like this.

349
0:16:07.007,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And we're down to less than 70 nesting pairs in Florida Bay today,

350
0:16:11.647,000 --> 0:16:13,000
because we've disrupted the system so much.

351
0:16:14.215,000 --> 0:16:17,000
So all these different organizations are shouting, they're screaming,

352
0:16:17.49,000 --> 0:16:19,000
"The Everglades is fragile! It's fragile!"

353
0:16:19.529,000 --> 0:16:2,000
It is not.

354
0:16:20.704,000 --> 0:16:21,000
It is resilient.

355
0:16:22.278,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Because despite all we've taken, despite all we've done and we've drained

356
0:16:25.794,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and we've dammed and we've dredged it,

357
0:16:27.657,000 --> 0:16:29,000
pieces of it are still here, waiting to be put back together.

358
0:16:30.577,000 --> 0:16:32,000
And this is what I've loved about South Florida,

359
0:16:32.855,000 --> 0:16:35,000
that in one place, you have this unstoppable force of mankind

360
0:16:36.653,000 --> 0:16:39,000
meeting the immovable object of tropical nature.

361
0:16:40.973,000 --> 0:16:43,000
And it's at this new frontier that we are forced with a new appraisal.

362
0:16:44.837,000 --> 0:16:45,000
What is wilderness worth?

363
0:16:47.119,000 --> 0:16:5,000
What is the value of biodiversity, or our drinking water?

364
0:16:51.195,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And fortunately, after decades of debate,

365
0:16:53.652,000 --> 0:16:55,000
we're finally starting to act on those questions.

366
0:16:56.643,000 --> 0:16:58,000
We're slowly undertaking these projects

367
0:16:59.024,000 --> 0:17:01,000
to bring more freshwater back to the bay.

368
0:17:01.544,000 --> 0:17:04,000
But it's up to us as citizens, as residents, as stewards

369
0:17:05.223,000 --> 0:17:07,000
to hold our elected officials to their promises.

370
0:17:09.154,000 --> 0:17:1,000
What can you do to help?

371
0:17:11.011,000 --> 0:17:12,000
It's so easy.

372
0:17:12.29,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Just get outside, get out there.

373
0:17:14.282,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Take your friends out, take your kids out,

374
0:17:16.337,000 --> 0:17:17,000
take your family out.

375
0:17:17.936,000 --> 0:17:18,000
Hire a fishing guide.

376
0:17:19.622,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Show the state that protecting wilderness

377
0:17:21.629,000 --> 0:17:25,000
not only makes ecological sense, but economic sense as well.

378
0:17:26.288,000 --> 0:17:29,000
It's a lot of fun, just do it -- put your feet in the water.

379
0:17:29.639,000 --> 0:17:31,000
The swamp will change you, I promise.

380
0:17:33.351,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Over the years, we've been so generous

381
0:17:35.247,000 --> 0:17:38,000
with these other landscapes around the country,

382
0:17:38.341,000 --> 0:17:4,000
cloaking them with this American pride,

383
0:17:41.186,000 --> 0:17:43,000
places that we now consider to define us:

384
0:17:43.581,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone.

385
0:17:46.73,000 --> 0:17:48,000
And we use these parks and these natural areas

386
0:17:49.163,000 --> 0:17:52,000
as beacons and as cultural compasses.

387
0:17:53.184,000 --> 0:17:55,000
And sadly, the Everglades is very commonly

388
0:17:55.253,000 --> 0:17:56,000
left out of that conversation.

389
0:17:57.6,000 --> 0:17:59,000
But I believe it's every bit as iconic and emblematic

390
0:18:00.132,000 --> 0:18:01,000
of who we are as a country

391
0:18:02.029,000 --> 0:18:04,000
as any of these other wildernesses.

392
0:18:04.554,000 --> 0:18:06,000
It's just a different kind of wild.

393
0:18:08.057,000 --> 0:18:09,000
But I'm encouraged,

394
0:18:09.408,000 --> 0:18:11,000
because maybe we're finally starting to come around,

395
0:18:12.126,000 --> 0:18:14,000
because what was once deemed this swampy wasteland,

396
0:18:14.737,000 --> 0:18:16,000
today is a World Heritage site.

397
0:18:17.404,000 --> 0:18:19,000
It's a wetland of international importance.

398
0:18:20.699,000 --> 0:18:22,000
And we've come a long way in the last 60 years.

399
0:18:23.526,000 --> 0:18:27,000
And as the world's largest and most ambitious wetland restoration project,

400
0:18:27.944,000 --> 0:18:31,000
the international spotlight is on us in the Sunshine State.

401
0:18:32.309,000 --> 0:18:33,000
Because if we can heal this system,

402
0:18:34.066,000 --> 0:18:37,000
it's going to become an icon for wetland restoration

403
0:18:37.539,000 --> 0:18:38,000
all over the world.

404
0:18:40.236,000 --> 0:18:44,000
But it's up to us to decide which legacy we want to attach our flag to.

405
0:18:45.508,000 --> 0:18:48,000
They say that the Everglades is our greatest test.

406
0:18:49.984,000 --> 0:18:51,000
If we pass it, we get to keep the planet.

407
0:18:53.565,000 --> 0:18:54,000
I love that quote,

408
0:18:54.992,000 --> 0:18:56,000
because it's a challenge, it's a prod.

409
0:18:57.049,000 --> 0:18:58,000
Can we do it? Will we do it?

410
0:18:58.952,000 --> 0:18:59,000
We have to, we must.

411
0:19:01.507,000 --> 0:19:02,000
But the Everglades is not just a test.

412
0:19:03.916,000 --> 0:19:04,000
It's also a gift,

413
0:19:05.559,000 --> 0:19:07,000
and ultimately, our responsibility.

414
0:19:08.959,000 --> 0:19:09,000
Thank you.

415
0:19:10.134,000 --> 0:19:13,000
(Applause)

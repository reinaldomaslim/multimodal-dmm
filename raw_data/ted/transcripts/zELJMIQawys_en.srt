1
0:00:12.833,000 --> 0:00:15,000
To start, I want to share with you guys something about my hometown

2
0:00:16.042,000 --> 0:00:17,000
of Norwalk, Ohio.

3
0:00:17.333,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Now, as this video stated, I am from Norwalk,

4
0:00:19.5,000 --> 0:00:22,000
which is an extremely small town, about 15,000 people.

5
0:00:22.667,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And really, in Norwalk, if you want to do something fun,

6
0:00:25.333,000 --> 0:00:28,000
you go to Walmart or drive half an hour to something more interesting.

7
0:00:28.666,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And for Norwalk, I've lived there for my entire life,

8
0:00:31.625,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I'm a senior at the local public high school,

9
0:00:34.458,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and you know, it's something to where I really enjoy my small town.

10
0:00:37.875,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And I'm just a normal kid, you know,

11
0:00:39.875,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I lead debate clubs, I volunteer at my church.

12
0:00:42.292,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And back in November of 2018,

13
0:00:45.5,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I made a small Reddit post asking for advice

14
0:00:47.625,000 --> 0:00:51,000
on an issue that I was encountering that I needed some clarification on.

15
0:00:52.542,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And this issue, as was stated in the introduction,

16
0:00:54.917,000 --> 0:00:55,000
was something towards vaccinations

17
0:00:56.708,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and how I was not immunized against various diseases,

18
0:00:59.417,000 --> 0:01:03,000
including polio and measles, as well as influenza, HPV, hepatitis --

19
0:01:03.917,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the standard vaccine someone my age would receive.

20
0:01:06.917,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Now, this question I asked was simple and pretty strange,

21
0:01:10.5,000 --> 0:01:12,000
because, you know, I wanted to get vaccinated.

22
0:01:12.667,000 --> 0:01:13,000
That's kind of weird, but it happened,

23
0:01:14.583,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and then this turned into a public story,

24
0:01:16.792,000 --> 0:01:18,000
because I wanted to get vaccinated.

25
0:01:18.958,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So that was kind of strange, and then it blew up more,

26
0:01:21.542,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and I was doing interviews and talking to more people,

27
0:01:24.09,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and again, I'm a normal kid, I'm not a scientist,

28
0:01:26.417,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I don't lead a non-profit, I am a pretty casual person,

29
0:01:29.667,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I'm wearing a hoodie.

30
0:01:31.083,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:33.167,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Because of this question and this story,

32
0:01:36.333,000 --> 0:01:37,000
because I wanted to get vaccinated

33
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and this interesting situation I was in,

34
0:01:39.958,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I saw that I quickly was in this public setting

35
0:01:42.173,000 --> 0:01:45,000
of an extremely important controversy and discussion taking place.

36
0:01:46.083,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Now, I saw that the stories and headlines were pretty accurate for most part,

37
0:01:50.167,000 --> 0:01:52,000
you know, "After defying anti-vax mom,

38
0:01:52.458,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Ohio teen expresses why he got vaccinated."

39
0:01:54.792,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Pretty accurate, pretty true.

40
0:01:56.583,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And, as stated, I testified in front of a Senate committee,

41
0:01:59.417,000 --> 0:02:,000
so there, they said,

42
0:02:00.875,000 --> 0:02:01,000
"This teen who self-vaccinated

43
0:02:02.333,000 --> 0:02:05,000
just ripped his mom's anti-vaxer beliefs in front of Congress."

44
0:02:05.417,000 --> 0:02:08,000
OK, I didn't really do that, but that's fine.

45
0:02:08.75,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And certain news outlets took it a little further.

46
0:02:13.167,000 --> 0:02:14,000
"'God knows how I'm still alive':

47
0:02:14.958,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Teenager, 18, finally gets vaccinated and attacks his anti-vax parents."

48
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So I did not attack my parents, that's not accurate at all.

49
0:02:23.5,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And you know, really, my story was more about controversy.

50
0:02:27.042,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It was about how my mom was bad and I was good,

51
0:02:30.167,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and I was ripping her a new one.

52
0:02:32.042,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Not true.

53
0:02:33.333,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Not what was happening.

54
0:02:34.625,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I never was rude towards my mother,

55
0:02:36.375,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and even in public settings where I expressed

56
0:02:38.583,000 --> 0:02:39,000
how her beliefs were misinformed,

57
0:02:40.208,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I said that she was a loving mother, and that's important to understand.

58
0:02:44.042,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Because a lot of people, I think, in the scientific community

59
0:02:46.958,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that understand why vaccines are so important,

60
0:02:49.167,000 --> 0:02:51,000
can really be confused by someone who would not vaccinate.

61
0:02:51.917,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Really, we can compare it to someone not taking their child to the ER.

62
0:02:55.25,000 --> 0:02:57,000
That's a very dangerous situation to be in

63
0:02:57.274,000 --> 0:03:,000
and it shows some lack of empathy towards your children in some regards.

64
0:03:00.679,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And really, I can understand that, I can.

65
0:03:02.917,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But my mom, she was misinformed and misled by sources that convinced her

66
0:03:07.125,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that if she was a loving parent, she wouldn't vaccinate.

67
0:03:10.917,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Now, when I encountered this and I talked to my mom,

68
0:03:13.833,000 --> 0:03:14,000
it didn't obviously go well at first,

69
0:03:15.667,000 --> 0:03:16,000
because I was wanting to do something

70
0:03:17.48,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that she thought would either cause autism or maim me for the rest of my life,

71
0:03:21.18,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and I said I wanted to do this -- didn't really fly,

72
0:03:23.626,000 --> 0:03:24,000
didn't really go well.

73
0:03:24.792,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But the thing that I found interesting

74
0:03:26.667,000 --> 0:03:28,000
was that when I had started to get into this circumstance,

75
0:03:29.5,000 --> 0:03:3,000
do these interviews,

76
0:03:30.792,000 --> 0:03:31,000
there was one question I proposed.

77
0:03:32.458,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Wasn't a positive one:

78
0:03:33.75,000 --> 0:03:35,000
What in the world have I gotten myself into?

79
0:03:35.875,000 --> 0:03:36,000
That's what I asked constantly,

80
0:03:37.417,000 --> 0:03:39,000
because, again, I am not an expert, I am a normal kid,

81
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and now I'm talking to CNN and Fox News about a scientific discussion

82
0:03:43.333,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that really, should I be facilitating, should I be commenting on?

83
0:03:47.583,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And a lot of people questioned that, and for good reason.

84
0:03:50.667,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But I never claimed things I didn't understand,

85
0:03:52.882,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I talked about my personal experiences.

86
0:03:54.792,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And even at the Senate hearing,

87
0:03:56.293,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I just talked about how misinformation is dangerous.

88
0:03:58.792,000 --> 0:04:01,000
My mom got a lot of her beliefs from social media, from Facebook

89
0:04:01.875,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and from organizations that were allowing their platforms to push lies

90
0:04:05.208,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that were very dangerous.

91
0:04:06.5,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Now, I also saw that as I was doing this --

92
0:04:08.917,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and I was doing this as respectfully as I could,

93
0:04:11.208,000 --> 0:04:12,000
as accurately as I could --

94
0:04:12.583,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I was getting a lot of criticism, a lot of very angry people.

95
0:04:15.465,000 --> 0:04:17,000
When I was in DC for that testimony I gave,

96
0:04:17.75,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I was looking around the office building

97
0:04:19.833,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and three ladies got in an elevator with me

98
0:04:21.917,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and said I'm the reason their children are being maimed and murdered

99
0:04:25.167,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and I'm basically Hitler.

100
0:04:26.542,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So that was fun.

101
0:04:27.875,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:29.75,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So really, for most circumstances, for most teenagers and most people,

103
0:04:34.458,000 --> 0:04:36,000
when they get criticized, it leads to doubt.

104
0:04:36.583,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And that doubt leads to questioning, and that questioning leads to quitting.

105
0:04:40.208,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Because, when you have a topic that you're interested in,

106
0:04:43.625,000 --> 0:04:45,000
or a movement that you want to be a part of,

107
0:04:46.125,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and you're taking a stance and saying what's true,

108
0:04:48.5,000 --> 0:04:49,000
good ideas don't avoid criticism.

109
0:04:50.25,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And for especially young people, they have a hard time dealing with that,

110
0:04:53.708,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and these important discussions that need young people to take a part in,

111
0:04:57.208,000 --> 0:04:58,000
it takes a lot of commitment.

112
0:04:58.667,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I'm not saying that I'm amazing, but here's what's important:

113
0:05:01.708,000 --> 0:05:04,000
through me joining this movement and this important scientific discussion,

114
0:05:05.25,000 --> 0:05:06,000
here's what happened.

115
0:05:06.583,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Facebook changed their platform.

116
0:05:08.167,000 --> 0:05:1,000
They were going to change how they approach anti-vax content.

117
0:05:11.125,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Amazon even removed misinformed books about autism and vaccines.

118
0:05:14.208,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And recently, GoFundMe took down anti-vax campaigns.

119
0:05:16.792,000 --> 0:05:19,000
We're talking about how movements like this are causing actual change,

120
0:05:20.125,000 --> 0:05:22,000
actually impacting the way this game is played

121
0:05:22.375,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and the misinformation that's lying to people

122
0:05:24.542,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and convincing them of very dangerous ideas.

123
0:05:26.958,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Now, before I leave, because I only have a short amount of time,

124
0:05:30.042,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I want to give you one important thing to keep in mind.

125
0:05:32.708,000 --> 0:05:33,000
One important takeaway from this all.

126
0:05:34.542,000 --> 0:05:36,000
What you can do and what I did.

127
0:05:36.917,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I didn't do amazing research and studies

128
0:05:40.167,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and take information and present it to people;

129
0:05:42.375,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I didn't have deep, intellectual, scientific debates with people.

130
0:05:45.792,000 --> 0:05:46,000
All I did was share my story.

131
0:05:47.667,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And that's enough for most people:

132
0:05:49.333,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to understand the anecdotal experiences, the real people behind the data.

133
0:05:54.167,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Because data doesn't resonate with people.

134
0:05:56.208,000 --> 0:05:57,000
People resonate with people.

135
0:05:57.625,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And you have to keep that in mind,

136
0:05:59.292,000 --> 0:06:01,000
because when you are talking about a topic,

137
0:06:01.417,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and you're sharing your story, and sharing what is important,

138
0:06:04.333,000 --> 0:06:05,000
you stay authentic.

139
0:06:05.625,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Stay authentic to the data, to the information,

140
0:06:07.875,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to the importance of this topic.

141
0:06:09.583,000 --> 0:06:1,000
If I was talking to an individual

142
0:06:11.208,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and they said, "Why are vaccines important?"

143
0:06:13.292,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I would say nothing alongside any other answer,

144
0:06:15.583,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I would not in any way fathomably give them answer outside of:

145
0:06:19.292,000 --> 0:06:21,000
people are dying, and that's important.

146
0:06:21.833,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And that children are dying, and that's important.

147
0:06:24.333,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And that we're having disease outbreaks that should not be here.

148
0:06:27.375,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And I believe, as John Boyle put it,

149
0:06:29.167,000 --> 0:06:32,000
these diseases should be in history books and not in our communities.

150
0:06:32.43,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So because of that, you need to make a personal decision to stand up for truth.

151
0:06:36.18,000 --> 0:06:38,000
You need to make a personal decision for yourself

152
0:06:38.583,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to say, "This is accurate, this is what's real,

153
0:06:41.667,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and these lies are not OK."

154
0:06:43.125,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Because it started with me doing that on a personal level.

155
0:06:45.875,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I wasn't going from small town to Senate in a day.

156
0:06:48.292,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It wasn't like, I go to bed, I wake up

157
0:06:50.167,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and there's Senator Isakson, asking me questions about vaccines.

158
0:06:53.25,000 --> 0:06:55,000
It was a slow progression and it started with me saying,

159
0:06:55.917,000 --> 0:06:56,000
"This is true,

160
0:06:57.25,000 --> 0:06:59,000
my mom doesn't believe it, but that's OK."

161
0:06:59.333,000 --> 0:07:,000
Because that doesn't change the truth,

162
0:07:01.208,000 --> 0:07:03,000
doesn't change what's accurate and what's important.

163
0:07:03.833,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And honestly, the biggest thing,

164
0:07:06.25,000 --> 0:07:09,000
this whole idea of unbreakable: remain unbroken.

165
0:07:09.542,000 --> 0:07:11,000
When you stand up for what's true and you have that criticism,

166
0:07:12.5,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and you're trying to cause a movement, don't sway.

167
0:07:15.583,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Thank you.

168
0:07:16.875,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.641,000 --> 0:00:16,000
These are some photos of me volunteering in a Cambodian orphanage

2
0:00:16.757,000 --> 0:00:17,000
in 2006.

3
0:00:18.66,000 --> 0:00:19,000
When these photos were taken,

4
0:00:20.587,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I thought I was doing a really good thing

5
0:00:22.913,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and that I was really helping those kids.

6
0:00:26.333,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I had a lot to learn.

7
0:00:29.039,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It all started for me when I was 19 years old

8
0:00:31.859,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and went backpacking through Southeast Asia.

9
0:00:34.863,000 --> 0:00:35,000
When I reached Cambodia,

10
0:00:36.562,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I felt uncomfortable being on holiday surrounded by so much poverty

11
0:00:40.86,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and wanted to do something to give back.

12
0:00:43.695,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So I visited some orphanages and donated some clothes and books

13
0:00:47.437,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and some money

14
0:00:48.755,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to help the kids that I met.

15
0:00:51.535,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But one of the orphanages I visited was desperately poor.

16
0:00:55.711,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I had never encountered poverty like that before in my life.

17
0:00:59.985,000 --> 0:01:01,000
They didn't have funds for enough food,

18
0:01:02.419,000 --> 0:01:03,000
clean water

19
0:01:03.753,000 --> 0:01:04,000
or medical treatment,

20
0:01:05.769,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and the sad little faces on those kids

21
0:01:08.691,000 --> 0:01:09,000
were heartbreaking.

22
0:01:10.55,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So I was compelled to do something more to help.

23
0:01:14.078,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I fund-raised in Australia and returned to Cambodia the following year

24
0:01:17.766,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to volunteer at the orphanage for a few months.

25
0:01:21.195,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I taught English and bought water filters and food

26
0:01:24.368,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and took all of the kids to the dentist for the first time in their lives.

27
0:01:29.307,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But over the course of the next year,

28
0:01:31.244,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I came to discover that this orphanage that I had been supporting

29
0:01:34.852,000 --> 0:01:35,000
was terribly corrupt.

30
0:01:36.934,000 --> 0:01:4,000
The director had been embezzling every cent donated to the orphanage,

31
0:01:41.715,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and in my absence, the children were suffering such gross neglect

32
0:01:46.089,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that they were forced to catch mice to feed themselves.

33
0:01:50.306,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I also found out later

34
0:01:51.733,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that the director had been physically and sexually abusing the kids.

35
0:01:56.703,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I couldn't bring myself to turn my back on children

36
0:01:59.343,000 --> 0:02:01,000
who I had come to know and care about

37
0:02:02.029,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and return to my life in Australia.

38
0:02:04.981,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So I worked with a local team and the local authorities

39
0:02:08.542,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to set up a new orphanage and rescue the kids

40
0:02:11.945,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to give them a safe new home.

41
0:02:16.041,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But this is where my story takes another unexpected turn.

42
0:02:20.77,000 --> 0:02:25,000
As I adjusted to my new life running an orphanage in Cambodia,

43
0:02:26.815,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Khmer) I learned to speak Khmer fluently,

44
0:02:30.797,000 --> 0:02:33,000
which means that I learned to speak the Khmer language fluently.

45
0:02:34.344,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And when I could communicate properly with the kids,

46
0:02:37.419,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I began to uncover some strange things.

47
0:02:41.517,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Most of the children we had removed from the orphanage

48
0:02:45.206,000 --> 0:02:48,000
were not, in fact, orphans at all.

49
0:02:49.833,000 --> 0:02:5,000
They had parents,

50
0:02:52.367,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and the few that were orphaned had other living relatives,

51
0:02:55.762,000 --> 0:02:57,000
like grandparents and aunties and uncles

52
0:02:58.306,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and other siblings.

53
0:03:00.705,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So why were these children living in an orphanage

54
0:03:05.161,000 --> 0:03:07,000
when they weren't orphans?

55
0:03:09.097,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Since 2005, the number of orphanages in Cambodia

56
0:03:12.355,000 --> 0:03:14,000
has risen by 75 percent,

57
0:03:15.596,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and the number of children living in Cambodian orphanages

58
0:03:18.715,000 --> 0:03:2,000
has nearly doubled,

59
0:03:20.885,000 --> 0:03:21,000
despite the fact

60
0:03:22.421,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that the vast majority of children living in these orphanages

61
0:03:25.568,000 --> 0:03:27,000
are not orphans in the traditional sense.

62
0:03:29.097,000 --> 0:03:31,000
They're children from poor families.

63
0:03:32.711,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So if the vast majority of children living in orphanages

64
0:03:35.665,000 --> 0:03:36,000
are not orphans,

65
0:03:37.112,000 --> 0:03:38,000
then the term "orphanage"

66
0:03:38.998,000 --> 0:03:42,000
is really just a euphemistic name for a residential care institution.

67
0:03:44.381,000 --> 0:03:46,000
These institutions go by other names as well,

68
0:03:47.338,000 --> 0:03:52,000
like "shelters," "safe houses," "children's homes," "children's villages,"

69
0:03:52.847,000 --> 0:03:53,000
even "boarding schools."

70
0:03:55.25,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And this problem is not just confined to Cambodia.

71
0:04:00.271,000 --> 0:04:03,000
This map shows some of the countries that have seen a dramatic increase

72
0:04:04.086,000 --> 0:04:06,000
in the numbers of residential care institutions

73
0:04:06.945,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and the numbers of children being institutionalized.

74
0:04:11.627,000 --> 0:04:12,000
In Uganda, for example,

75
0:04:13.058,000 --> 0:04:15,000
the number of children living in institutions

76
0:04:15.671,000 --> 0:04:2,000
has increased by more than 1,600 percent since 1992.

77
0:04:22.409,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And the problems posed by putting kids into institutions

78
0:04:26.853,000 --> 0:04:3,000
don't just pertain to the corrupt and abusive institutions

79
0:04:31.552,000 --> 0:04:33,000
like the one that I rescued the kids from.

80
0:04:34.231,000 --> 0:04:38,000
The problems are with all forms of residential care.

81
0:04:39.749,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Over 60 years of international research has shown us

82
0:04:43.779,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that children who grow up in institutions,

83
0:04:47.119,000 --> 0:04:49,000
even the very best institutions,

84
0:04:50.087,000 --> 0:04:53,000
are at serious risk of developing mental illnesses,

85
0:04:53.615,000 --> 0:04:54,000
attachment disorders,

86
0:04:55.422,000 --> 0:04:57,000
growth and speech delays,

87
0:04:57.677,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and many will struggle with an inability to reintegrate

88
0:05:00.665,000 --> 0:05:02,000
back into society later in life

89
0:05:02.901,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and form healthy relationships as adults.

90
0:05:06.646,000 --> 0:05:09,000
These kids grow up without any model of family

91
0:05:09.858,000 --> 0:05:11,000
or of what good parenting looks like,

92
0:05:12.329,000 --> 0:05:15,000
so they then can struggle to parent their own children.

93
0:05:16.604,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So if you institutionalize large numbers of children,

94
0:05:20.745,000 --> 0:05:23,000
it will affect not only this generation,

95
0:05:24.306,000 --> 0:05:26,000
but also the generations to come.

96
0:05:28.366,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We've learned these lessons before in Australia.

97
0:05:31.881,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's what happened to our "Stolen Generations,"

98
0:05:35.73,000 --> 0:05:38,000
the indigenous children who were removed from their families

99
0:05:39.412,000 --> 0:05:41,000
with the belief that we could do a better job

100
0:05:41.857,000 --> 0:05:43,000
of raising their children.

101
0:05:45.782,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Just imagine for a moment

102
0:05:47.329,000 --> 0:05:49,000
what residential care would be like for a child.

103
0:05:50.843,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Firstly, you have a constant rotation of caregivers,

104
0:05:54.025,000 --> 0:05:57,000
with somebody new coming on to the shift every eight hours.

105
0:05:57.739,000 --> 0:06:,000
And then on top of that you have a steady stream of visitors

106
0:06:00.966,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and volunteers coming in,

107
0:06:02.752,000 --> 0:06:05,000
showering you in the love and affection you're craving

108
0:06:07.041,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and then leaving again,

109
0:06:09.157,000 --> 0:06:11,000
evoking all of those feelings of abandonment,

110
0:06:12.083,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and proving again and again

111
0:06:15.379,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that you are not worthy of being loved.

112
0:06:19.475,000 --> 0:06:24,000
We don't have orphanages in Australia, the USA, the UK anymore,

113
0:06:25.297,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and for a very good reason:

114
0:06:28.175,000 --> 0:06:31,000
one study has shown that young adults raised in institutions

115
0:06:31.768,000 --> 0:06:34,000
are 10 times more likely to fall into sex work than their peers,

116
0:06:36.298,000 --> 0:06:39,000
40 times more likely to have a criminal record,

117
0:06:40.586,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and 500 times more likely

118
0:06:44.712,000 --> 0:06:45,000
to take their own lives.

119
0:06:48.623,000 --> 0:06:52,000
There are an estimated eight million children around the world

120
0:06:53.351,000 --> 0:06:56,000
living in institutions like orphanages,

121
0:06:56.399,000 --> 0:07:,000
despite the fact that around 80 percent of them are not orphans.

122
0:07:01.623,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Most have families who could be caring for them

123
0:07:04.628,000 --> 0:07:05,000
if they had the right support.

124
0:07:08.066,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But for me,

125
0:07:09.975,000 --> 0:07:11,000
the most shocking thing of all to realize

126
0:07:13.325,000 --> 0:07:15,000
is what's contributing to this boom

127
0:07:16.001,000 --> 0:07:21,000
in the unnecessary institutionalization of so many children:

128
0:07:23.184,000 --> 0:07:24,000
it's us --

129
0:07:25.576,000 --> 0:07:28,000
the tourists, the volunteers

130
0:07:29.334,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and the donors.

131
0:07:31.783,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It's the well-meaning support from people like me back in 2006,

132
0:07:37.278,000 --> 0:07:4,000
who visit these children and volunteer and donate,

133
0:07:41.171,000 --> 0:07:46,000
who are unwittingly fueling an industry that exploits children

134
0:07:46.294,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and tears families apart.

135
0:07:49.761,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It's really no coincidence that these institutions are largely set up

136
0:07:53.563,000 --> 0:07:55,000
in areas where tourists can most easily be lured in

137
0:07:56.499,000 --> 0:08:,000
to visit and volunteer in exchange for donations.

138
0:08:01.744,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Of the 600 so-called orphanages in Nepal,

139
0:08:05.869,000 --> 0:08:09,000
over 90 percent of them are located in the most popular tourist hotspots.

140
0:08:12.222,000 --> 0:08:14,000
The cold, hard truth is,

141
0:08:14.459,000 --> 0:08:18,000
the more money that floods in in support of these institutions,

142
0:08:18.826,000 --> 0:08:2,000
the more institutions open

143
0:08:21.715,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and the more children are removed from their families

144
0:08:24.885,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to fill their beds.

145
0:08:27.055,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It's just the laws of supply and demand.

146
0:08:32.434,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I had to learn all of these lessons the hard way,

147
0:08:35.595,000 --> 0:08:38,000
after I had already set up an orphanage in Cambodia.

148
0:08:40.297,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I had to eat a big piece of humble pie to admit

149
0:08:44.289,000 --> 0:08:46,000
that I had made a mistake

150
0:08:46.718,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and inadvertently become a part of the problem.

151
0:08:50.634,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I had been an orphanage tourist,

152
0:08:52.986,000 --> 0:08:53,000
a voluntourist.

153
0:08:54.871,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I then set up my own orphanage and facilitated orphanage tourism

154
0:08:59.878,000 --> 0:09:01,000
in order to generate funds for my orphanage,

155
0:09:03.281,000 --> 0:09:04,000
before I knew better.

156
0:09:06.195,000 --> 0:09:08,000
What I came to learn

157
0:09:08.227,000 --> 0:09:11,000
is that no matter how good my orphanage was,

158
0:09:11.661,000 --> 0:09:15,000
it was never going to give those kids what they really needed:

159
0:09:17.769,000 --> 0:09:18,000
their families.

160
0:09:21.118,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I know that it can feel incredibly depressing

161
0:09:24.161,000 --> 0:09:27,000
to learn that helping vulnerable children and overcoming poverty

162
0:09:27.94,000 --> 0:09:3,000
is not as simple as we've all been led to believe it should be.

163
0:09:32.741,000 --> 0:09:35,000
But thankfully, there is a solution.

164
0:09:36.484,000 --> 0:09:39,000
These problems are reversible and preventable,

165
0:09:40.306,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and when we know better,

166
0:09:42.344,000 --> 0:09:43,000
we can do better.

167
0:09:44.913,000 --> 0:09:46,000
The organization that I run today,

168
0:09:47.285,000 --> 0:09:49,000
the Cambodian Children's Trust,

169
0:09:49.581,000 --> 0:09:51,000
is no longer an orphanage.

170
0:09:52.255,000 --> 0:09:57,000
In 2012, we changed the model in favor of family-based care.

171
0:09:58.891,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I now lead an amazing team of Cambodian social workers,

172
0:10:02.706,000 --> 0:10:03,000
nurses and teachers.

173
0:10:04.803,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Together, we work within communities

174
0:10:07.232,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to untangle a complex web of social issues

175
0:10:10.57,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and help Cambodian families escape poverty.

176
0:10:14.595,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Our primary focus is on preventing some of the most vulnerable families

177
0:10:18.777,000 --> 0:10:19,000
in our community

178
0:10:19.962,000 --> 0:10:21,000
from being separated in the first place.

179
0:10:23.314,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But in cases where it's not possible

180
0:10:25.371,000 --> 0:10:28,000
for a child to live with its biological family,

181
0:10:28.649,000 --> 0:10:3,000
we support them in foster care.

182
0:10:31.99,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Family-based care is always better

183
0:10:35.681,000 --> 0:10:38,000
than placing a child in an institution.

184
0:10:40.293,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Do you remember that first photo that I showed you before?

185
0:10:43.875,000 --> 0:10:46,000
See that girl who is just about to catch the ball?

186
0:10:47.042,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Her name is Torn

187
0:10:49.283,000 --> 0:10:52,000
She's a strong, brave and fiercely intelligent girl.

188
0:10:53.157,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But in 2006, when I first met her

189
0:10:56.076,000 --> 0:10:59,000
living in that corrupt and abusive orphanage,

190
0:10:59.869,000 --> 0:11:,000
she had never been to school.

191
0:11:02.193,000 --> 0:11:04,000
She was suffering terrible neglect,

192
0:11:04.957,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and she yearned desperately

193
0:11:07.817,000 --> 0:11:09,000
for the warmth and love of her mother.

194
0:11:12.354,000 --> 0:11:16,000
But this is a photo of Torn today with her family.

195
0:11:16.462,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Her mother now has a secure job,

196
0:11:18.9,000 --> 0:11:2,000
her siblings are doing well in high school

197
0:11:21.448,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and she is just about to finish her nursing degree at university.

198
0:11:25.928,000 --> 0:11:26,000
For Torn's family --

199
0:11:27.523,000 --> 0:11:33,000
(Applause)

200
0:11:36.057,000 --> 0:11:37,000
for Torn's family,

201
0:11:37.486,000 --> 0:11:39,000
the cycle of poverty has been broken.

202
0:11:41.091,000 --> 0:11:44,000
The family-based care model that we have developed at CCT

203
0:11:44.787,000 --> 0:11:45,000
has been so successful,

204
0:11:46.62,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that it's now being put forward by UNICEF Cambodia

205
0:11:50.022,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and the Cambodian government

206
0:11:51.562,000 --> 0:11:55,000
as a national solution to keep children in families.

207
0:11:56.936,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And one of the best --

208
0:11:58.721,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Applause)

209
0:12:04.484,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And one of the best ways that you can help to solve this problem

210
0:12:08.85,000 --> 0:12:11,000
is by giving these eight million children a voice

211
0:12:12.67,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and become an advocate for family-based care.

212
0:12:16.358,000 --> 0:12:19,000
If we work together to raise awareness,

213
0:12:19.484,000 --> 0:12:21,000
we can make sure the world knows

214
0:12:22.344,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that we need to put an end to the unnecessary institutionalization

215
0:12:27.476,000 --> 0:12:28,000
of vulnerable children.

216
0:12:29.973,000 --> 0:12:3,000
How do we achieve that?

217
0:12:32.014,000 --> 0:12:35,000
By redirecting our support and our donations

218
0:12:35.865,000 --> 0:12:39,000
away from orphanages and residential care institutions

219
0:12:40.215,000 --> 0:12:46,000
towards organizations that are committed to keeping children in families.

220
0:12:47.384,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I believe we can make this happen in our lifetime,

221
0:12:50.827,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and as a result, we will see developing communities thrive

222
0:12:54.494,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and ensure that vulnerable children everywhere

223
0:12:57.711,000 --> 0:13:,000
have what all children need and deserve:

224
0:13:02.468,000 --> 0:13:03,000
a family.

225
0:13:03.879,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Thank you.

226
0:13:05.083,000 --> 0:13:08,000
(Applause)

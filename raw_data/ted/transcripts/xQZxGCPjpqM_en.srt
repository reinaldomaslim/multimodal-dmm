1
0:00:12.929,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm a radio glaciologist.

2
0:00:15.397,000 --> 0:00:18,000
That means that I use radar to study glaciers and ice sheets.

3
0:00:19.705,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And like most glaciologists right now,

4
0:00:21.752,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I'm working on the problem of estimating

5
0:00:23.844,000 --> 0:00:27,000
how much the ice is going to contribute to sea level rise in the future.

6
0:00:28.367,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So today, I want to talk to you about

7
0:00:30.166,000 --> 0:00:33,000
why it's so hard to put good numbers on sea level rise,

8
0:00:33.927,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and why I believe that by changing the way we think about radar technology

9
0:00:37.991,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and earth-science education,

10
0:00:39.403,000 --> 0:00:4,000
we can get much better at it.

11
0:00:42.03,000 --> 0:00:44,000
When most scientists talk about sea level rise,

12
0:00:44.356,000 --> 0:00:45,000
they show a plot like this.

13
0:00:45.761,000 --> 0:00:47,000
This is produced using ice sheet and climate models.

14
0:00:48.966,000 --> 0:00:5,000
On the right, you can see the range of sea level

15
0:00:51.331,000 --> 0:00:54,000
predicted by these models over the next 100 years.

16
0:00:54.553,000 --> 0:00:56,000
For context, this is current sea level,

17
0:00:57.529,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and this is the sea level

18
0:00:58.951,000 --> 0:01:01,000
above which more than 4 million people could be vulnerable to displacement.

19
0:01:02.863,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So in terms of planning,

20
0:01:04.657,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the uncertainty in this plot is already large.

21
0:01:07.863,000 --> 0:01:11,000
However, beyond that, this plot comes with the asterisk and the caveat,

22
0:01:12.561,000 --> 0:01:14,000
"... unless the West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapses."

23
0:01:15.506,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And in that case, we would be talking about dramatically higher numbers.

24
0:01:19.093,000 --> 0:01:2,000
They'd literally be off the chart.

25
0:01:21.671,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And the reason we should take that possibility seriously

26
0:01:24.76,000 --> 0:01:26,000
is that we know from the geologic history of the Earth

27
0:01:27.364,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that there were periods in its history

28
0:01:29.546,000 --> 0:01:31,000
when sea level rose much more quickly than today.

29
0:01:32.211,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And right now, we cannot rule out

30
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
the possibility of that happening in the future.

31
0:01:37.625,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So why can't we say with confidence

32
0:01:40.785,000 --> 0:01:45,000
whether or not a significant portion of a continent-scale ice sheet

33
0:01:46.006,000 --> 0:01:48,000
will or will not collapse?

34
0:01:48.799,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Well, in order to do that, we need models

35
0:01:50.808,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that we know include all of the processes, conditions and physics

36
0:01:54.413,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that would be involved in a collapse like that.

37
0:01:57.206,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And that's hard to know,

38
0:01:58.69,000 --> 0:02:,000
because those processes and conditions are taking place

39
0:02:01.448,000 --> 0:02:02,000
beneath kilometers of ice,

40
0:02:03.311,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and satellites, like the one that produced this image,

41
0:02:05.885,000 --> 0:02:06,000
are blind to observe them.

42
0:02:07.713,000 --> 0:02:11,000
In fact, we have much more comprehensive observations of the surface of Mars

43
0:02:12.021,000 --> 0:02:14,000
than we do of what's beneath the Antarctic ice sheet.

44
0:02:15.829,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And this is even more challenging in that we need these observations

45
0:02:19.06,000 --> 0:02:22,000
at a gigantic scale in both space and time.

46
0:02:22.687,000 --> 0:02:24,000
In terms of space, this is a continent.

47
0:02:25.322,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And in the same way that in North America,

48
0:02:27.466,000 --> 0:02:31,000
the Rocky Mountains, Everglades and Great Lakes regions are very distinct,

49
0:02:31.53,000 --> 0:02:33,000
so are the subsurface regions of Antarctica.

50
0:02:34.545,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And in terms of time, we now know

51
0:02:36.212,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that ice sheets not only evolve over the timescale of millennia and centuries,

52
0:02:40.577,000 --> 0:02:43,000
but they're also changing over the scale of years and days.

53
0:02:44.387,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So what we want is observations beneath kilometers of ice

54
0:02:48.72,000 --> 0:02:49,000
at the scale of a continent,

55
0:02:50.673,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and we want them all the time.

56
0:02:53.014,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So how do we do this?

57
0:02:54.814,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Well, we're not totally blind to the subsurface.

58
0:02:58.894,000 --> 0:03:,000
I said in the beginning that I was a radio glaciologist,

59
0:03:01.588,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and the reason that that's a thing

60
0:03:03.49,000 --> 0:03:06,000
is that airborne ice-penetrating radar is the main tool we have

61
0:03:07.284,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to see inside of ice sheets.

62
0:03:09.212,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So most of the data used by my group is collected by airplanes

63
0:03:13.082,000 --> 0:03:15,000
like this World War II-era DC-3,

64
0:03:15.331,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that actually fought in the Battle of the Bulge.

65
0:03:17.807,000 --> 0:03:19,000
You can see the antennas underneath the wing.

66
0:03:20.411,000 --> 0:03:23,000
These are used to transmit radar signals down into the ice.

67
0:03:24.165,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And the echos that come back contain information

68
0:03:26.642,000 --> 0:03:28,000
about what's happening inside and beneath the ice sheet.

69
0:03:30.53,000 --> 0:03:31,000
While this is happening,

70
0:03:31.871,000 --> 0:03:33,000
scientists and engineers are on the airplane

71
0:03:34.18,000 --> 0:03:35,000
for eight hours at a stretch,

72
0:03:35.691,000 --> 0:03:36,000
making sure that the radar's working.

73
0:03:37.996,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And I think this is actually a misconception

74
0:03:40.561,000 --> 0:03:41,000
about this type of fieldwork,

75
0:03:42.029,000 --> 0:03:45,000
where people imagine scientists peering out the window,

76
0:03:45.2,000 --> 0:03:47,000
contemplating the landscape, its geologic context

77
0:03:48.138,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and the fate of the ice sheets.

78
0:03:50.327,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We actually had a guy from the BBC's "Frozen Planet" on one of these flights.

79
0:03:53.974,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And he spent, like, hours videotaping us turn knobs.

80
0:03:57.046,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Laughter)

81
0:03:59.673,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And I was actually watching the series years later with my wife,

82
0:04:03.073,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and a scene like this came up, and I commented on how beautiful it was.

83
0:04:07.001,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And she said, "Weren't you on that flight?"

84
0:04:09.955,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Laughter)

85
0:04:11.138,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I said, "Yeah, but I was looking at a computer screen."

86
0:04:14.107,000 --> 0:04:15,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:15.387,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So when you think about this type of fieldwork,

88
0:04:17.618,000 --> 0:04:19,000
don't think about images like this.

89
0:04:19.665,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Think about images like this.

90
0:04:21.38,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:22.567,000 --> 0:04:25,000
This is a radargram, which is a vertical profile through the ice sheet,

92
0:04:25.933,000 --> 0:04:26,000
kind of like a slice of cake.

93
0:04:27.768,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The bright layer on the top is the surface of the ice sheet,

94
0:04:30.641,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the bright layer on the bottom is the bedrock of the continent itself,

95
0:04:33.995,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and the layers in between are kind of like tree rings,

96
0:04:36.545,000 --> 0:04:39,000
in that they contain information about the history of the ice sheet.

97
0:04:39.776,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And it's amazing that this works this well.

98
0:04:42.321,000 --> 0:04:44,000
The ground-penetrating radars that are used

99
0:04:44.363,000 --> 0:04:46,000
to investigate infrastructures of roads or detect land mines

100
0:04:47.315,000 --> 0:04:49,000
struggle to get through a few meters of earth.

101
0:04:49.498,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And here we're peering through three kilometers of ice.

102
0:04:52.278,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And there are sophisticated, interesting, electromagnetic reasons for that,

103
0:04:56.142,000 --> 0:05:,000
but let's say for now that ice is basically the perfect target for radar,

104
0:05:00.317,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and radar is basically the perfect tool to study ice sheets.

105
0:05:04.641,000 --> 0:05:05,000
These are the flight lines

106
0:05:05.944,000 --> 0:05:08,000
of most of the modern airborne radar-sounding profiles

107
0:05:09.012,000 --> 0:05:1,000
collected over Antarctica.

108
0:05:10.75,000 --> 0:05:12,000
This is the result of heroic efforts over decades

109
0:05:13.744,000 --> 0:05:16,000
by teams from a variety of countries and international collaborations.

110
0:05:17.672,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And when you put those together, you get an image like this,

111
0:05:20.553,000 --> 0:05:22,000
which is what the continent of Antarctica would look like

112
0:05:23.283,000 --> 0:05:24,000
without all the ice on top.

113
0:05:25.958,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And you can really see the diversity of the continent in an image like this.

114
0:05:30.514,000 --> 0:05:32,000
The red features are volcanoes or mountains;

115
0:05:32.95,000 --> 0:05:34,000
the areas that are blue would be open ocean

116
0:05:35.084,000 --> 0:05:36,000
if the ice sheet was removed.

117
0:05:36.688,000 --> 0:05:38,000
This is that giant spatial scale.

118
0:05:39.807,000 --> 0:05:42,000
However, all of this that took decades to produce

119
0:05:42.832,000 --> 0:05:45,000
is just one snapshot of the subsurface.

120
0:05:46.22,000 --> 0:05:5,000
It does not give us any indication of how the ice sheet is changing in time.

121
0:05:51.338,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Now, we're working on that, because it turns out

122
0:05:53.779,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that the very first radar observations of Antarctica were collected

123
0:05:57.252,000 --> 0:05:59,000
using 35 millimeter optical film.

124
0:06:00.021,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And there were thousands of reels of this film

125
0:06:02.236,000 --> 0:06:05,000
in the archives of the museum of the Scott Polar Research Institute

126
0:06:05.514,000 --> 0:06:06,000
at the University of Cambridge.

127
0:06:07.04,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So last summer, I took a state-of-the-art film scanner

128
0:06:09.645,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that was developed for digitizing Hollywood films and remastering them,

129
0:06:13.225,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and two art historians,

130
0:06:14.4,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and we went over to England, put on some gloves

131
0:06:16.642,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and archived and digitized all of that film.

132
0:06:19.744,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So that produced two million high-resolution images

133
0:06:22.863,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that my group is now working on analyzing and processing

134
0:06:26.085,000 --> 0:06:28,000
for comparing with contemporary conditions in the ice sheet.

135
0:06:29.458,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And, actually, that scanner -- I found out about it

136
0:06:31.874,000 --> 0:06:34,000
from an archivist at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

137
0:06:35.284,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So I'd like to thank the Academy --

138
0:06:37.832,000 --> 0:06:39,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:40.101,000 --> 0:06:41,000
for making this possible.

140
0:06:41.443,000 --> 0:06:42,000
(Laughter)

141
0:06:42.522,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And as amazing as it is

142
0:06:44.243,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that we can look at what was happening under the ice sheet 50 years ago,

143
0:06:47.903,000 --> 0:06:49,000
this is still just one more snapshot.

144
0:06:50.609,000 --> 0:06:52,000
It doesn't give us observations

145
0:06:52.75,000 --> 0:06:55,000
of the variation at the annual or seasonal scale,

146
0:06:55.947,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that we know matters.

147
0:06:57.926,000 --> 0:06:58,000
There's some progress here, too.

148
0:06:59.514,000 --> 0:07:02,000
There are these recent ground-based radar systems that stay in one spot.

149
0:07:03.062,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So you take these radars and put them on the ice sheet

150
0:07:05.699,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and you bury a cache of car batteries.

151
0:07:07.613,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And you leave them out there for months or years at a time,

152
0:07:10.447,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and they send a pulse down into the ice sheet

153
0:07:12.583,000 --> 0:07:13,000
every so many minutes or hours.

154
0:07:14.105,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So this gives you continuous observation in time --

155
0:07:16.958,000 --> 0:07:17,000
but at one spot.

156
0:07:18.418,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So if you compare that imaging to the 2-D pictures provided by the airplane,

157
0:07:22.832,000 --> 0:07:23,000
this is just one vertical line.

158
0:07:25.498,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And this is pretty much where we are as a field right now.

159
0:07:28.378,000 --> 0:07:3,000
We can choose between good spatial coverage

160
0:07:31.06,000 --> 0:07:32,000
with airborne radar sounding

161
0:07:32.577,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and good temporal coverage in one spot with ground-based sounding.

162
0:07:36.41,000 --> 0:07:38,000
But neither gives us what we really want:

163
0:07:38.745,000 --> 0:07:39,000
both at the same time.

164
0:07:40.753,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And if we're going to do that,

165
0:07:42.214,000 --> 0:07:45,000
we're going to need totally new ways of observing the ice sheet.

166
0:07:45.245,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And ideally, those should be extremely low-cost

167
0:07:47.99,000 --> 0:07:5,000
so that we can take lots of measurements from lots of sensors.

168
0:07:51.871,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Well, for existing radar systems,

169
0:07:54.038,000 --> 0:07:57,000
the biggest driver of cost is the power required

170
0:07:57.106,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to transmit the radar signal itself.

171
0:08:00.187,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So it’d be great if we were able to use existing radio systems

172
0:08:03.506,000 --> 0:08:05,000
or radio signals that are in the environment.

173
0:08:06.252,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And fortunately, the entire field of radio astronomy

174
0:08:09.125,000 --> 0:08:12,000
is built on the fact that there are bright radio signals in the sky.

175
0:08:12.934,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And a really bright one is our sun.

176
0:08:15.259,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So, actually, one of the most exciting things my group is doing right now

177
0:08:18.743,000 --> 0:08:21,000
is trying to use the radio emissions from the sun as a type of radar signal.

178
0:08:22.354,000 --> 0:08:24,000
This is one of our field tests at Big Sur.

179
0:08:24.565,000 --> 0:08:28,000
That PVC pipe ziggurat is an antenna stand some undergrads in my lab built.

180
0:08:29.1,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And the idea here is that we stay out at Big Sur,

181
0:08:32.107,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and we watch the sunset in radio frequencies,

182
0:08:34.569,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and we try and detect the reflection of the sun off the surface of the ocean.

183
0:08:39.585,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Now, I know you're thinking, "There are no glaciers at Big Sur."

184
0:08:43.405,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Laughter)

185
0:08:44.514,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And that's true.

186
0:08:45.696,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Laughter)

187
0:08:46.9,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But it turns out that detecting the reflection of the sun

188
0:08:50.624,000 --> 0:08:51,000
off the surface of the ocean

189
0:08:52.006,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and detecting the reflection off the bottom of an ice sheet

190
0:08:54.832,000 --> 0:08:55,000
are extremely geophysically similar.

191
0:08:56.597,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And if this works,

192
0:08:57.82,000 --> 0:09:,000
we should be able to apply the same measurement principle in Antarctica.

193
0:09:01.249,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And this is not as far-fetched as it seems.

194
0:09:03.313,000 --> 0:09:06,000
The seismic industry has gone through a similar technique-development exercise,

195
0:09:07.09,000 --> 0:09:1,000
where they were able to move from detonating dynamite as a source,

196
0:09:10.244,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to using ambient seismic noise in the environment.

197
0:09:12.757,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And defense radars use TV signals and radio signals all the time,

198
0:09:16.614,000 --> 0:09:18,000
so they don't have to transmit a signal of radar

199
0:09:19.217,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and give away their position.

200
0:09:21.28,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So what I'm saying is, this might really work.

201
0:09:23.902,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And if it does, we're going to need extremely low-cost sensors

202
0:09:27.128,000 --> 0:09:3,000
so we can deploy networks of hundreds or thousands of these on an ice sheet

203
0:09:30.741,000 --> 0:09:31,000
to do imaging.

204
0:09:31.916,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And that's where the technological stars have really aligned to help us.

205
0:09:35.546,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Those earlier radar systems I talked about

206
0:09:37.974,000 --> 0:09:4,000
were developed by experienced engineers over the course of years

207
0:09:41.631,000 --> 0:09:42,000
at national facilities

208
0:09:43.004,000 --> 0:09:44,000
with expensive specialized equipment.

209
0:09:45.354,000 --> 0:09:47,000
But the recent developments in software-defined radio,

210
0:09:48.268,000 --> 0:09:5,000
rapid fabrication and the maker movement,

211
0:09:50.538,000 --> 0:09:52,000
make it so that it's possible for a team of teenagers

212
0:09:53.514,000 --> 0:09:55,000
working in my lab over the course of a handful of months

213
0:09:56.18,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to build a prototype radar.

214
0:09:58.045,000 --> 0:10:,000
OK, they're not any teenagers, they’re Stanford undergrads,

215
0:10:00.878,000 --> 0:10:01,000
but the point holds --

216
0:10:02.549,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Laughter)

217
0:10:03.997,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that these enabling technologies are letting us break down the barrier

218
0:10:07.324,000 --> 0:10:1,000
between engineers who build instruments and scientists that use them.

219
0:10:11.59,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And by teaching engineering students to think like earth scientists

220
0:10:15.555,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and earth-science students who can think like engineers,

221
0:10:18.257,000 --> 0:10:22,000
my lab is building an environment in which we can build custom radar sensors

222
0:10:22.514,000 --> 0:10:23,000
for each problem at hand,

223
0:10:24.148,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that are optimized for low cost and high performance

224
0:10:27.609,000 --> 0:10:28,000
for that problem.

225
0:10:29.101,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And that's going to totally change the way we observe ice sheets.

226
0:10:32.998,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Look, the sea level problem and the role of the cryosphere in sea level rise

227
0:10:38.103,000 --> 0:10:39,000
is extremely important

228
0:10:39.712,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and will affect the entire world.

229
0:10:41.815,000 --> 0:10:43,000
But that is not why I work on it.

230
0:10:44.458,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I work on it for the opportunity to teach and mentor

231
0:10:47.597,000 --> 0:10:48,000
extremely brilliant students,

232
0:10:49.804,000 --> 0:10:52,000
because I deeply believe that teams of hypertalented,

233
0:10:52.937,000 --> 0:10:54,000
hyperdriven, hyperpassionate young people

234
0:10:55.453,000 --> 0:10:57,000
can solve most of the challenges facing the world,

235
0:10:58.577,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and that providing the observations required to estimate sea level rise

236
0:11:02.613,000 --> 0:11:05,000
is just one of the many such problems they can and will solve.

237
0:11:06.768,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Thank you.

238
0:11:07.944,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Applause)

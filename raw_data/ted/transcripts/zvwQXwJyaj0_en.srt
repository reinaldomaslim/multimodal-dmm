1
0:00:15.33,000 --> 0:00:17,000
You may not know this,

2
0:00:17.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but you are celebrating an anniversary with me.

3
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I'm not married,

4
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but one year ago today,

5
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I woke up

6
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
from a month-long coma,

7
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
following a double lung transplant.

8
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Crazy, I know. Insane.

9
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Thank you.

10
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Six years before that,

11
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I was starting my career

12
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
as an opera singer in Europe,

13
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
when I was diagnosed with

14
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
idiopathic pulmonary hypertension --

15
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
also known as PH.

16
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It happens when there's a thickening

17
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
in the pulmonary veins,

18
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
making the right side of the heart

19
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
work overtime,

20
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and causing what I call

21
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
the reverse-Grinch effect.

22
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
My heart was three-and-a-half sizes

23
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
too big.

24
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Physical activity becomes very difficult

25
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
for people with this condition,

26
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and usually after two to five years,

27
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
you die.

28
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I went to see this specialist,

29
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and she was top-of-the-field

30
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and told me I had to stop singing.

31
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
She said, "Those high notes are going to kill you."

32
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
While she didn't have any medical evidence

33
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to back up her claim

34
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that there was a relationship

35
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
between operatic arias

36
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and pulmonary hypertension,

37
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
she was absolutely emphatic

38
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I was singing my own obituary.

39
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I was very limited by my condition, physically.

40
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But I was not limited when I sang,

41
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and as air came up from my lungs,

42
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
through my vocal cords

43
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and passed my lips as sound,

44
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
it was the closest thing I had ever come

45
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to transcendence.

46
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And just because of someone's hunch,

47
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I wasn't going to give it up.

48
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Thankfully, I met Reda Girgis,

49
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
who is dry as toast,

50
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but he and his team at Johns Hopkins

51
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
didn't just want me to survive,

52
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
they wanted me

53
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to live a meaningful life.

54
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
This meant making trade-offs.

55
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I come from Colorado.

56
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It's a mile high,

57
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and I grew up there with my 10 brothers and sisters

58
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and two adoring parents.

59
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Well, the altitude exacerbated my symptoms.

60
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So I moved to Baltimore to be near my doctors

61
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and enrolled in a conservatory nearby.

62
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I couldn't walk as much as I used to,

63
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
so I opted for five-inch heels.

64
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And I gave up salt,

65
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
I went vegan,

66
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and I started taking huge doses of

67
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
sildenafil,

68
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
also known as Viagra.

69
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
My father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing

71
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
in alternative or traditional therapies

72
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
for PH,

73
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
but after six months,

74
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I couldn't walk up a small hill. I couldn't climb a flight of stairs.

75
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I could barely stand up

76
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
without feeling like I was going to faint.

77
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I had a heart catheterization,

78
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
where they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure,

79
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
which is supposed to be between 15 and 20.

80
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Mine was 146.

81
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I like to do things big,

82
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and it meant one thing:

83
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
there is a big gun treatment

84
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
for pulmonary hypertension called Flolan,

85
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and it's not just a drug;

86
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
it's a way of life.

87
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Doctors insert a catheter into your chest,

88
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
which is attached to a pump

89
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that weighs about four-and-a-half pounds.

90
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Every day, 24 hours, that pump is at your side,

91
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
administering medicine

92
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
directly to your heart,

93
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and it's not

94
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
a particularly preferable

95
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
medicine in many senses.

96
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
This is a list of the side effects:

97
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
if you eat too much salt,

98
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,

99
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
you'll probably end up in the ICU.

100
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
If you go through a metal detector,

101
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
you'll probably die.

102
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
If you get a bubble in your medicine --

103
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
because you have to mix it every morning --

104
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and it stays in there,

105
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
you probably die.

106
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
If you run out of medicine, you definitely die.

107
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
No one wants to go on Flolan.

108
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
But when I needed it,

109
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
it was a godsend.

110
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Within a few days, I could walk again.

111
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Within a few weeks, I was performing,

112
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and in a few months,

113
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I debuted at the Kennedy Center.

114
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
The pump was a little bit problematic when performing,

115
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
so I'd attach it to my inner thigh

116
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
with the help of the girdle and an ACE bandage.

117
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Literally hundreds of elevator rides

118
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
were spent with me alone

119
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
stuffing the pump into my Spanx,

120
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly.

121
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And the tubing coming out of my chest

122
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
was a nightmare for costume designers.

123
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I graduated from graduate school in 2006,

124
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and I got a fellowship to go back to Europe.

125
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
A few days after arriving,

126
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I met this wonderful, old conductor

127
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
who started casting me in all of these roles.

128
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And before long, I was commuting

129
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
between Budapest, Milan

130
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and Florence.

131
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Though I was attached

132
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
to this ugly, unwanted,

133
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
high-maintenance, mechanical pet,

134
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
my life was kind of like the happy part in an opera --

135
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
very complicated,

136
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
but in a good way.

137
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Then in February

138
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
of 2008,

139
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
my grandfather passed away.

140
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
He was a big figure in all of our lives,

141
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and we loved him very much.

142
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It certainly didn't prepare me

143
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
for what came next.

144
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Seven weeks later,

145
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I got a call from my family.

146
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
My father had been in a catastrophic car accident,

147
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and he died.

148
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
At 24, my death would have been

149
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
entirely expected.

150
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
But his --

151
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
well, the only way I can articulate how it felt

152
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
was that it precipitated

153
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
my medical decline.

154
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Against my doctors' and family's wishes,

155
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I needed to go back for the funeral.

156
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I had to say goodbye

157
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
in some way, shape or form.

158
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But soon I was showing signs of right-heart failure,

159
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and I had to return to sea level,

160
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
doing so knowing

161
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that I probably would never see my home again.

162
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I canceled most of my engagements that summer,

163
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but I had one left in Tel Aviv, so I went.

164
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
After one performance,

165
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I could barely drag myself

166
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
from the stage to the taxicab.

167
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I sat down and felt the blood

168
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
rush down from my face,

169
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and in the heat of the desert,

170
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I was freezing cold.

171
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
My fingers started turning blue,

172
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and I was like, "What is going on here?"

173
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I heard my heart's valves

174
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
snapping open and closed.

175
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The cab stopped,

176
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and I pulled my body from it

177
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
feeling each ounce of weight

178
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
as I walked to the elevator.

179
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I fell through my apartment door

180
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and crawled to the bathroom

181
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
where I found my problem:

182
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
I had forgotten to mix in

183
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
the most important part of my medicine.

184
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I was dying,

185
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and if I didn't mix that stuff up fast,

186
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I would never leave that apartment alive.

187
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I started mixing,

188
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and I felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another,

189
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but I just kept on going.

190
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Finally, with the last bottle in and the last bubble out,

191
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I attached the pump to the tubing

192
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and lay there hoping it would kick in

193
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
soon enough.

194
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
If it didn't, I'd probably see my father

195
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
sooner than I anticipated.

196
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Thankfully, in a few minutes,

197
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I saw the signature hive-like rash

198
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
appear on my legs,

199
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
which is a side effect of the medication,

200
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and I knew I'd be okay.

201
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We're not big on fear in my family,

202
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but I was scared.

203
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I went back to the States,

204
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
anticipating I'd return to Europe,

205
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
but the heart catheterization

206
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
showed that I wasn't going anywhere

207
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
further that a flight-for-life from Johns Hopkins Hospital.

208
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I performed here and there,

209
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
but as my condition deteriorated,

210
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
so did my voice.

211
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
My doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant.

212
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I didn't.

213
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I had two friends who had recently died

214
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
months after having very challenging surgeries.

215
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I knew another young man, though, who had PH

216
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
who died while waiting for one.

217
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I wanted to live.

218
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I thought stem cells were a good option,

219
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
but they hadn't developed to a point

220
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
where I could take advantage of them yet.

221
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I officially took a break from singing,

222
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and I went to the Cleveland Clinic

223
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to be reevaluated

224
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
for the third time in five years, for transplant.

225
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking

226
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
with the head transplant surgeon,

227
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and I asked him if I needed a transplant,

228
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
what I could do to prepare.

229
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
He said, "Be happy.

230
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
A happy patient

231
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
is a healthy patient."

232
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
It was like in one verbal swoop

233
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
he had channeled my thoughts

234
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
on life and medicine

235
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and Confucius.

236
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I still didn't want a transplant,

237
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
but in a month,

238
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I was back in the hospital

239
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
with some severely edemic kankles --

240
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
very attractive.

241
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And it was right-heart failure.

242
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I finally decided

243
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
it was time to take my doctor's advice.

244
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It was time for me to go to Cleveland

245
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and to start the agonizing wait

246
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
for a match.

247
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
But the next morning,

248
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
while I was still in the hospital,

249
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I got a telephone call.

250
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It was my doctor in Cleveland,

251
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Marie Budev.

252
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And they had lungs.

253
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
It was a match.

254
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
They were from Texas.

255
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And everybody was really happy for me,

256
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
but me.

257
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Because, despite their problems,

258
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I had spent my whole life training my lungs,

259
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and I was not particularly enthusiastic

260
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
about giving them up.

261
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
I flew to Cleveland,

262
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and my family rushed there

263
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
in hopes that they would meet me

264
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and say what we knew

265
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
might be our final goodbye.

266
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
But organs don't wait,

267
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and I went into surgery

268
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
before I could say goodbye.

269
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
The last thing I remember

270
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
was lying on a white blanket,

271
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
telling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again,

272
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and to please try and save my voice.

273
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I fell into this apocalyptic dream world.

274
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
During the thirteen-and-a-half-hour surgery,

275
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I flatlined twice,

276
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
40 quarts of blood

277
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
were infused into my body.

278
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And in my surgeon's 20-year career,

279
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
he said it was among the most difficult transplants

280
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
that he's ever performed.

281
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
They left my chest open for two weeks.

282
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
You could see my over-sized heart

283
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
beating inside of it.

284
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
I was on a dozen machines

285
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
that were keeping me alive.

286
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
An infection ravaged my skin.

287
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I had hoped my voice would be saved,

288
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
but my doctors knew

289
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that the breathing tubes going down my throat

290
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
might have already destroyed it.

291
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
If they stayed in, there was no way I would ever sing again.

292
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So my doctor got the ENT,

293
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
the top guy at the clinic, to come down

294
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and give me surgery

295
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to move the tubes around my voice box.

296
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
He said it would kill me.

297
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
So my own surgeon performed the procedure

298
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
in a last-ditch attempt to save my voice.

299
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Though my mom couldn't say goodbye to me

300
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
before the surgery,

301
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
she didn't leave my side

302
0:12:58.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
in the months of recovery that followed.

303
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And if you want an example

304
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
of perseverance,

305
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
grit and strength

306
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
in a beautiful, little package,

307
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
it is her.

308
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
One year ago

309
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
to this very day,

310
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I woke up.

311
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
I was 95 lbs.

312
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
There were a dozen tubes

313
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
coming in and out of my body.

314
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
I couldn't walk, I couldn't talk,

315
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
I couldn't eat, I couldn't move,

316
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I certainly couldn't sing,

317
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I couldn't even breathe,

318
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
but when I looked up

319
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and I saw my mother,

320
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
I couldn't help but smile.

321
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Whether by a Mack truck

322
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
or by heart failure

323
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
or faulty lungs,

324
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
death happens.

325
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
But life isn't really just about avoiding death, is it?

326
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
It's about living.

327
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Medical conditions don't negate the human condition.

328
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And when people are allowed

329
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
to pursue their passions,

330
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
doctors will find they have better,

331
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
happier and healthier patients.

332
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
My parents were totally stressed out

333
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
about me going and auditioning

334
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and traveling and performing all over the place,

335
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
but they knew that it was much better for me to do that

336
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time.

337
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And I'm so grateful they did.

338
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
This past summer, when I was running and singing

339
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews

340
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother

341
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
in the Colorado Rockies,

342
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I couldn't help but think of that doctor

343
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
who told me that I couldn't sing.

344
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And I wanted to tell her,

345
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and I want to tell you,

346
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
we need to stop letting disease

347
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
divorce us from our dreams.

348
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
When we do,

349
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
we will find that patients

350
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
don't just survive;

351
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
we thrive.

352
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And some of us

353
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
might even sing.

354
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
(Applause)

355
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:17:36,000
[Singing: French]

356
0:17:37.33,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Thank you.

357
0:17:39.33,000 --> 0:17:45,000
(Applause)

358
0:17:45.33,000 --> 0:17:47,000
Thank you.

359
0:17:47.33,000 --> 0:17:5,000
And I'd like to thank my pianist, Monica Lee.

360
0:17:50.33,000 --> 0:17:55,000
(Applause)

361
0:17:55.33,000 --> 0:17:57,000
Thank you so much.

362
0:17:57.33,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Thank you.

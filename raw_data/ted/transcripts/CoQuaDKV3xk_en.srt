1
0:00:11.269,000 --> 0:00:17,000
hi everybody hi Whitney hey David how

2
0:00:15.21,000 --> 0:00:21,000
are you doing I am good and I'm excited

3
0:00:17.609,000 --> 0:00:25,000
for for this conversation even if it is

4
0:00:21.51,000 --> 0:00:26,000
about pandemics I mean that that is the

5
0:00:25.619,000 --> 0:00:28,000
thing to talk about right now and I feel

6
0:00:27.48,000 --> 0:00:3,000
like some you know we'll have some

7
0:00:29.22,000 --> 0:00:32,000
things to share that could really help

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
us all understand a little bit better

9
0:00:32.85,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and feel hopefully a little bit better

10
0:00:34.85,000 --> 0:00:39,000
exactly we can learn from the past so

11
0:00:37.76,000 --> 0:00:42,000
without further ado I'd like to

12
0:00:40.17,000 --> 0:00:46,000
introduce Sonia Shah she's a

13
0:00:43.219,000 --> 0:00:48,000
award-winning journalist and author who

14
0:00:46.53,000 --> 0:00:51,000
counts among her many illuminating books

15
0:00:48.75,000 --> 0:00:52,000
one simply titled pandemic and she's

16
0:00:51.539,000 --> 0:00:54,000
here to help us understand what a

17
0:00:53.07,000 --> 0:00:57,000
pandemic is and what we can learn from

18
0:00:55.289,000 --> 0:01:,000
the pandemics of the past thanks for

19
0:00:57.449,000 --> 0:01:03,000
joining us Sonia nice to be here nice to

20
0:01:00.39,000 --> 0:01:05,000
see you nice to see you too so I guess

21
0:01:04.199,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I'll start with having written a book

22
0:01:06.27,000 --> 0:01:13,000
about this what does it feel like to

23
0:01:09.15,000 --> 0:01:17,000
have it kind of come true well it's very

24
0:01:13.56,000 --> 0:01:18,000
eerie and surreal but I think that's how

25
0:01:17.58,000 --> 0:01:21,000
a lot of people are feeling you know so

26
0:01:19.409,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I'm sort of experiencing the horror and

27
0:01:21.81,000 --> 0:01:26,000
tragedy of it with everyone else but

28
0:01:24.27,000 --> 0:01:3,000
also having a lot of sort of flashbacks

29
0:01:27.36,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to different historical epidemics and

30
0:01:30.45,000 --> 0:01:33,000
how they've unfolded and the fact that

31
0:01:31.979,000 --> 0:01:35,000
we're kind of reliving all of that is

32
0:01:33.57,000 --> 0:01:38,000
yeah it's a very eerie feeling yeah

33
0:01:36.78,000 --> 0:01:41,000
so at least I guess now we know it's a

34
0:01:39.119,000 --> 0:01:43,000
virus and not some bad air or whatever

35
0:01:41.939,000 --> 0:01:45,000
else people believed hundreds of years

36
0:01:43.71,000 --> 0:01:48,000
ago so what can we learn from past

37
0:01:45.96,000 --> 0:01:49,000
pandemics I mean it's it's interesting

38
0:01:48.869,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that you say that I think that is sort

39
0:01:50.579,000 --> 0:01:55,000
of the big difference I see is that we

40
0:01:52.979,000 --> 0:01:58,000
understand the transmission and sort of

41
0:01:56.31,000 --> 0:02:,000
the causative agent of pandemics today

42
0:01:59.1,000 --> 0:02:03,000
very rapidly like you know in the past

43
0:02:01.079,000 --> 0:02:04,000
with say cholera or malaria took

44
0:02:03.27,000 --> 0:02:06,000
hundreds of years to figure it out that

45
0:02:05.04,000 --> 0:02:09,000
you know oh it's caused by this like

46
0:02:07.14,000 --> 0:02:11,000
parasite or this cult of this bacteria

47
0:02:09.06,000 --> 0:02:13,000
or whatever microbial intruder it is

48
0:02:12.11,000 --> 0:02:16,000
nowadays we know

49
0:02:13.97,000 --> 0:02:17,000
really rapidly you know within like

50
0:02:16.25,000 --> 0:02:19,000
weeks of these things emerging we can

51
0:02:18.2,000 --> 0:02:22,000
understand what it is that's actually

52
0:02:19.79,000 --> 0:02:25,000
causing that but it's still not clear to

53
0:02:22.91,000 --> 0:02:27,000
me that that knowledge is you know

54
0:02:26.36,000 --> 0:02:3,000
helping us contain it any better you

55
0:02:28.64,000 --> 0:02:31,000
know so so so that's the trick I mean

56
0:02:30.71,000 --> 0:02:34,000
one of the things I wrote about in my

57
0:02:32.12,000 --> 0:02:37,000
last book pandemic was about the

58
0:02:35.27,000 --> 0:02:39,000
outbreak of cholera in Haiti which was

59
0:02:37.4,000 --> 0:02:4,000
similar to you know in a small scale to

60
0:02:39.47,000 --> 0:02:43,000
what we're seeing today in that this is

61
0:02:41.39,000 --> 0:02:45,000
a population that had never experienced

62
0:02:43.7,000 --> 0:02:46,000
this pathogen and then suddenly comes in

63
0:02:46.19,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and it just like spreads like wildfire

64
0:02:47.63,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and it's really this violent

65
0:02:49.75,000 --> 0:02:53,000
confrontation between a pathogen and a

66
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
new population that's never you know

67
0:02:54.41,000 --> 0:02:58,000
experienced it before and has no immune

68
0:02:55.94,000 --> 0:03:,000
defenses or anything else against it and

69
0:02:59.35,000 --> 0:03:02,000
in that case you know there was a lot of

70
0:03:01.85,000 --> 0:03:04,000
knowledge you know there was a lot of

71
0:03:03.2,000 --> 0:03:06,000
knowledge about what's causing it and

72
0:03:05.54,000 --> 0:03:08,000
you know people were collecting cell

73
0:03:07.07,000 --> 0:03:1,000
phone data and they could see like where

74
0:03:08.63,000 --> 0:03:11,000
is this Co ain't going oh it's going to

75
0:03:10.4,000 --> 0:03:13,000
hit this village necks gonna hit that

76
0:03:11.66,000 --> 0:03:15,000
village next and it was really cool so

77
0:03:13.79,000 --> 0:03:16,000
all these like cool maps that were made

78
0:03:15.77,000 --> 0:03:2,000
about cholera spreading in Haiti after

79
0:03:17.69,000 --> 0:03:24,000
the earthquake but it didn't actually

80
0:03:21.07,000 --> 0:03:27,000
help anyone here not get cholera you

81
0:03:25.04,000 --> 0:03:3,000
know so so there's two separate things

82
0:03:27.769,000 --> 0:03:31,000
here like we have the knowledge that's

83
0:03:30.05,000 --> 0:03:34,000
good but are we able to actually like

84
0:03:32.06,000 --> 0:03:36,000
act on the knowledge and in a way that

85
0:03:34.22,000 --> 0:03:4,000
will save lives

86
0:03:36.34,000 --> 0:03:43,000
yeah so on that point looking at past

87
0:03:40.25,000 --> 0:03:45,000
pandemics what should we be doing that

88
0:03:43.43,000 --> 0:03:47,000
we're not currently doing based on the

89
0:03:46.1,000 --> 0:03:5,000
past I mean I think the thing that

90
0:03:48.11,000 --> 0:03:53,000
always interested me about emerging

91
0:03:50.18,000 --> 0:03:56,000
diseases is that you know they take off

92
0:03:53.54,000 --> 0:04:,000
so quickly that you can't come up with

93
0:03:56.93,000 --> 0:04:02,000
the wonder drug the magic pill the the

94
0:04:00.65,000 --> 0:04:05,000
shot the vaccine all of those things

95
0:04:02.989,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that we have relied upon since you know

96
0:04:05.66,000 --> 0:04:1,000
the 1940s when we developed antibiotics

97
0:04:08.14,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that's has completely revolutionized

98
0:04:10.94,000 --> 0:04:14,000
medicine and it's completely changed the

99
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
way we deal with contagious diseases

100
0:04:15.049,000 --> 0:04:19,000
where we don't have to think about well

101
0:04:17.78,000 --> 0:04:21,000
maybe we should you know clean up our

102
0:04:19.729,000 --> 0:04:22,000
water supply or maybe we should separate

103
0:04:21.799,000 --> 0:04:24,000
our waste from our food or maybe we

104
0:04:23.479,000 --> 0:04:27,000
should you know all these things that we

105
0:04:24.86,000 --> 0:04:26,000
used to have to do to avoid contagion in

106
0:04:27.56,000 --> 0:04:29,000
the

107
0:04:27.8,000 --> 0:04:31,000
past we don't have to do that anymore or

108
0:04:30.11,000 --> 0:04:33,000
not so much because we think oh we'll

109
0:04:32.24,000 --> 0:04:35,000
just take a course of antibiotics like

110
0:04:33.83,000 --> 0:04:36,000
big diello we'll make a vaccine it's no

111
0:04:35.569,000 --> 0:04:39,000
problem

112
0:04:36.86,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and so you know and I think what's

113
0:04:40.159,000 --> 0:04:43,000
interesting about emerging diseases is

114
0:04:41.659,000 --> 0:04:45,000
when something's brand new it starts

115
0:04:43.94,000 --> 0:04:48,000
growing exponentially and of course our

116
0:04:46.31,000 --> 0:04:51,000
response is linear so there's a mismatch

117
0:04:48.949,000 --> 0:04:53,000
there and you cannot have a drug or

118
0:04:51.379,000 --> 0:04:56,000
vaccine in time for the first wave of

119
0:04:54.409,000 --> 0:04:58,000
infection in susceptible populations

120
0:04:56.599,000 --> 0:05:,000
which is of course the most sort of

121
0:04:58.49,000 --> 0:05:01,000
disruptive and dangerous wave so we saw

122
0:05:00.65,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that with Zika just now - right like

123
0:05:02.449,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Zika came through and it you know

124
0:05:04.069,000 --> 0:05:07,000
infected a whole load of people we have

125
0:05:05.659,000 --> 0:05:09,000
a whole generation of babies who are

126
0:05:07.159,000 --> 0:05:11,000
affected by that and we'll get some Zika

127
0:05:10.43,000 --> 0:05:14,000
treatments in Zika vaccines but it's not

128
0:05:12.139,000 --> 0:05:17,000
going to be in time for that first wave

129
0:05:15.129,000 --> 0:05:2,000
so what really you have to do with

130
0:05:17.99,000 --> 0:05:22,000
emerging diseases brand new diseases is

131
0:05:20.3,000 --> 0:05:24,000
you have to think about how to change

132
0:05:23.21,000 --> 0:05:27,000
behavior you know you have to have

133
0:05:25.28,000 --> 0:05:29,000
collective action and solidarity for

134
0:05:27.919,000 --> 0:05:31,000
everyone to say okay this is spreading

135
0:05:29.479,000 --> 0:05:33,000
using you know exploiting this facet of

136
0:05:32.479,000 --> 0:05:35,000
human behavior because of course that's

137
0:05:34.37,000 --> 0:05:38,000
always what they are doing right like a

138
0:05:36.469,000 --> 0:05:41,000
pathogen is a tiny microbe it can't move

139
0:05:39.02,000 --> 0:05:43,000
around on its own it's completely

140
0:05:41.479,000 --> 0:05:45,000
immobile unless we carry it around to

141
0:05:43.759,000 --> 0:05:48,000
each other so they're exploiting human

142
0:05:46.19,000 --> 0:05:5,000
behaviors and that's what we have to

143
0:05:48.8,000 --> 0:05:51,000
change then so so that's what really

144
0:05:50.96,000 --> 0:05:53,000
interested me about emerging diseases

145
0:05:52.61,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and we're seeing you know we're seeing

146
0:05:54.11,000 --> 0:06:,000
that play out and tragically right now

147
0:05:56.319,000 --> 0:06:03,000
yeah I mean obviously Kovan 19 is one of

148
0:06:00.5,000 --> 0:06:05,000
the worst pandemics in recent memory but

149
0:06:03.849,000 --> 0:06:07,000
it seems like you mentioned Zika

150
0:06:06.169,000 --> 0:06:11,000
infectious diseases like this even even

151
0:06:08.599,000 --> 0:06:13,000
kind of smaller scale pandemics were

152
0:06:11.69,000 --> 0:06:17,000
we're already on the rise why why is

153
0:06:14.27,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that yeah I mean I think what you know

154
0:06:17.779,000 --> 0:06:2,000
what first sort of got me interested in

155
0:06:19.699,000 --> 0:06:23,000
emerging diseases also is this idea

156
0:06:21.409,000 --> 0:06:27,000
about these microbes the pathogens

157
0:06:24.529,000 --> 0:06:3,000
themselves are not you know new right

158
0:06:27.71,000 --> 0:06:33,000
they're newly emerged so for example

159
0:06:31.279,000 --> 0:06:36,000
cholera lives in it's a you know it's a

160
0:06:34.34,000 --> 0:06:39,000
it's a bacteria that lives in marine

161
0:06:37.159,000 --> 0:06:41,000
habitats and it lives there you know

162
0:06:39.889,000 --> 0:06:42,000
it's been there for hundreds of

163
0:06:41.51,000 --> 0:06:46,000
of years or more but we didn't have

164
0:06:43.58,000 --> 0:06:49,000
cholera until you know 1817 we

165
0:06:47.29,000 --> 0:06:52,000
coronaviruses have probably been in bats

166
0:06:49.88,000 --> 0:06:54,000
for hundreds of years if not longer but

167
0:06:52.85,000 --> 0:06:57,000
we're only getting you know a SARS

168
0:06:55.31,000 --> 0:07:,000
pandemic and the current virus the Koba

169
0:06:58.13,000 --> 0:07:03,000
19 pandemic right now so why is that

170
0:07:00.65,000 --> 0:07:05,000
well we know that over the past 50 or 70

171
0:07:03.8,000 --> 0:07:07,000
years or so we've had the hundreds of

172
0:07:06.38,000 --> 0:07:1,000
new pathogens either kind of newly

173
0:07:08.72,000 --> 0:07:12,000
emerged or re-emerge into places where

174
0:07:10.88,000 --> 0:07:15,000
they have never been seen before

175
0:07:13.49,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Ebola in West Africa and 2014 s another

176
0:07:15.95,000 --> 0:07:18,000
example it had never we've had lots of

177
0:07:17.78,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Ebola outbreaks in the past since an you

178
0:07:19.76,000 --> 0:07:24,000
know the 1970s but never in that part of

179
0:07:23.15,000 --> 0:07:27,000
the continent in West Africa Zika in the

180
0:07:25.7,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Americas Zika existed for hundreds of

181
0:07:27.98,000 --> 0:07:3,000
years - at least you know we knew about

182
0:07:29.66,000 --> 0:07:32,000
it in in other parts of the world but it

183
0:07:31.82,000 --> 0:07:35,000
had never been seen in the Americas

184
0:07:33.38,000 --> 0:07:37,000
before we have new kinds of tick borne

185
0:07:36.14,000 --> 0:07:39,000
diseases new kinds of mosquito-borne

186
0:07:37.82,000 --> 0:07:41,000
illnesses new kinds of antibiotic

187
0:07:39.56,000 --> 0:07:44,000
resistant pathogens and you know the

188
0:07:42.44,000 --> 0:07:47,000
list goes on and on and so what we do

189
0:07:45.29,000 --> 0:07:5,000
know about them is that about 60% of

190
0:07:48.08,000 --> 0:07:53,000
these new pathogens are coming from the

191
0:07:50.66,000 --> 0:07:55,000
bodies of animals about 70% of those are

192
0:07:53.99,000 --> 0:07:57,000
coming from the bodies of wild animals

193
0:07:55.88,000 --> 0:08:,000
and that's not strange you know almost

194
0:07:58.66,000 --> 0:08:02,000
many many of our infectious diseases

195
0:08:01.22,000 --> 0:08:06,000
come from animals from you know ancient

196
0:08:03.08,000 --> 0:08:08,000
encounters with animals cows sheep you

197
0:08:06.8,000 --> 0:08:09,000
know chickens all kinds of animals have

198
0:08:08.72,000 --> 0:08:11,000
given us the diseases of you know we

199
0:08:10.7,000 --> 0:08:14,000
accept as sort of normal parts of

200
0:08:12.44,000 --> 0:08:17,000
childhood influenza measles all of that

201
0:08:15.08,000 --> 0:08:2,000
so that's not weird what's weird is that

202
0:08:17.78,000 --> 0:08:23,000
it's happening so fast now that you know

203
0:08:20.6,000 --> 0:08:25,000
this the scale apace has stepped up and

204
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
you know the other part of it is that we

205
0:08:25.94,000 --> 0:08:29,000
don't which we don't talk about enough

206
0:08:27.29,000 --> 0:08:32,000
is that humans are giving animals a

207
0:08:30.17,000 --> 0:08:35,000
pandemic causing pathogens also you know

208
0:08:32.9,000 --> 0:08:36,000
we've seen major pandemics and animal

209
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
species already white nose syndrome and

210
0:08:37.58,000 --> 0:08:42,000
that's kitchen fungus and amphibians

211
0:08:40.46,000 --> 0:08:43,000
colony collapse disorder in these you

212
0:08:42.71,000 --> 0:08:45,000
know there's there's a number of

213
0:08:43.669,000 --> 0:08:47,000
different ones so this exchange has been

214
0:08:45.83,000 --> 0:08:48,000
going on that's part of you know that's

215
0:08:47.9,000 --> 0:08:5,000
part of sort of the human condition

216
0:08:49.01,000 --> 0:08:53,000
living on a microbial planet is that we

217
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
share these microbes and when they come

218
0:08:53.51,000 --> 0:08:57,000
into a new

219
0:08:54.83,000 --> 0:08:58,000
habitats they expand to take advantage

220
0:08:57.709,000 --> 0:09:01,000
of it you know and in that spate that

221
0:08:59.779,000 --> 0:09:03,000
moment before our bodies can launch any

222
0:09:02.24,000 --> 0:09:07,000
kind of response they can really take

223
0:09:04.22,000 --> 0:09:1,000
over but the the underlying driver I

224
0:09:07.88,000 --> 0:09:11,000
think of the the speed at which we're

225
0:09:10.519,000 --> 0:09:15,000
seeing these new pathogens emerge today

226
0:09:12.5,000 --> 0:09:16,000
is because our expansion has reached

227
0:09:15.74,000 --> 0:09:19,000
sort of it like a tipping point almost

228
0:09:17.45,000 --> 0:09:21,000
you know I mean we've been industrial

229
0:09:19.97,000 --> 0:09:24,000
expansion has been going on for you know

230
0:09:22.07,000 --> 0:09:27,000
the last decades or so since we entered

231
0:09:25.1,000 --> 0:09:3,000
sort of the fossil fuel era in earnest

232
0:09:27.339,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and by now we've we've paved over over

233
0:09:30.98,000 --> 0:09:35,000
half of the terrestrial surface of the

234
0:09:33.769,000 --> 0:09:37,000
planet just in the last twenty years or

235
0:09:36.74,000 --> 0:09:39,000
so we've added another twenty two

236
0:09:38.48,000 --> 0:09:43,000
percent of the planet you know to for

237
0:09:40.579,000 --> 0:09:46,000
our farms or our mines or cities or

238
0:09:43.73,000 --> 0:09:48,000
towns or industrial activities and you

239
0:09:46.73,000 --> 0:09:5,000
know the most obvious impact of that is

240
0:09:48.86,000 --> 0:09:52,000
of course this the species extinction

241
0:09:51.32,000 --> 0:09:56,000
crisis the sixth extinction as we call

242
0:09:53.6,000 --> 0:09:58,000
it with 150 species being lost every day

243
0:09:56.62,000 --> 0:10:,000
but for the you know because we're

244
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:04,000
destroying where they live but the

245
0:10:00.92,000 --> 0:10:06,000
species that to hang on they have to

246
0:10:04.399,000 --> 0:10:1,000
crowd into ever smaller fragments that

247
0:10:07.339,000 --> 0:10:12,000
we leave for them so and that's more

248
0:10:10.97,000 --> 0:10:15,000
often going to be closer to where our

249
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
you know our habitations are and that

250
0:10:16.07,000 --> 0:10:2,000
just increases the probability of

251
0:10:18.02,000 --> 0:10:22,000
contact between wildlife and humans

252
0:10:20.57,000 --> 0:10:24,000
whether it's through you know bushmeat

253
0:10:22.49,000 --> 0:10:26,000
hunting or a wildlife trade or wet

254
0:10:25.13,000 --> 0:10:29,000
markets or farming or just casual

255
0:10:27.32,000 --> 0:10:32,000
contact you know the the Ebola outbreak

256
0:10:29.72,000 --> 0:10:35,000
of 2014 we know was traced back to a

257
0:10:33.23,000 --> 0:10:37,000
single spillover event which is a

258
0:10:35.75,000 --> 0:10:38,000
two-year-old child who's playing near a

259
0:10:37.79,000 --> 0:10:42,000
tree where bats were known to roost and

260
0:10:39.73,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that child was the very first case of

261
0:10:42.92,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Ebola in that in that epidemic and we

262
0:10:45.47,000 --> 0:10:49,000
know that from sort of genetic

263
0:10:46.64,000 --> 0:10:5,000
sequencing he infected his parents and

264
0:10:49.88,000 --> 0:10:51,000
they infected their healthcare workers

265
0:10:51.199,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and they infected their family members

266
0:10:52.579,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and you know on and on and on until

267
0:10:53.959,000 --> 0:10:58,000
eleven thousand people are dead and you

268
0:10:57.769,000 --> 0:11:01,000
know and that can that those kinds of

269
0:10:59.51,000 --> 0:11:03,000
events are you know if they're

270
0:11:01.82,000 --> 0:11:04,000
probabilistic right so it's not like

271
0:11:03.74,000 --> 0:11:06,000
it's definitely going to happen but you

272
0:11:05.66,000 --> 0:11:07,000
know if you cut down the trees where the

273
0:11:07.07,000 --> 0:11:1,000
bats live in the

274
0:11:08.36,000 --> 0:11:13,000
farm jungle they don't just disappear

275
0:11:10.459,000 --> 0:11:15,000
they come retard in your garden instead

276
0:11:13.85,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and so when your kid goes outside and

277
0:11:16.43,000 --> 0:11:19,000
plays with the picks up a piece of fruit

278
0:11:18.05,000 --> 0:11:23,000
it might have some fat poo on it or bat

279
0:11:20.39,000 --> 0:11:24,000
saliva on it and then they touch they

280
0:11:23.39,000 --> 0:11:25,000
hate you know they get it on a hand they

281
0:11:25.01,000 --> 0:11:31,000
touch their mouth that's that's it

282
0:11:26.269,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that's enough yeah yeah so so that's the

283
0:11:31.97,000 --> 0:11:34,000
kind of wildlife portion side of it but

284
0:11:33.74,000 --> 0:11:36,000
then as you were talking about there's

285
0:11:35.089,000 --> 0:11:41,000
the the human side of it and obviously

286
0:11:36.92,000 --> 0:11:42,000
we're taking big measures in many parts

287
0:11:41.75,000 --> 0:11:44,000
of the developed world with lockdowns

288
0:11:43.79,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and and whatever else but what about

289
0:11:45.74,000 --> 0:11:49,000
places that I mean you mentioned the

290
0:11:48.14,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Ebola pandemic with the places that

291
0:11:49.85,000 --> 0:11:54,000
don't have running water or soap or the

292
0:11:52.61,000 --> 0:11:57,000
ability to self isolate and still still

293
0:11:55.459,000 --> 0:12:,000
feed their family I'm thinking of you

294
0:11:57.95,000 --> 0:12:03,000
know India going on kind of lockdown but

295
0:12:01.149,000 --> 0:12:06,000
you know if you're a slum dweller how do

296
0:12:04.19,000 --> 0:12:08,000
you even do that is it is it going to be

297
0:12:06.41,000 --> 0:12:1,000
even harder to contain this virus

298
0:12:08.3,000 --> 0:12:14,000
because of you know the circumstances

299
0:12:10.79,000 --> 0:12:15,000
people are living in I mean I think what

300
0:12:14.3,000 --> 0:12:17,000
we need is a differentiated approach you

301
0:12:16.49,000 --> 0:12:2,000
know you don't have one size fits all

302
0:12:18.05,000 --> 0:12:23,000
for everywhere that this virus is going

303
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
to occur you know the demographics are

304
0:12:23.66,000 --> 0:12:27,000
different the socio-economic conditions

305
0:12:25.19,000 --> 0:12:3,000
are different so right now like you know

306
0:12:27.92,000 --> 0:12:31,000
lockdown is something that maybe and we

307
0:12:30.41,000 --> 0:12:34,000
don't even know how well it will work

308
0:12:32.12,000 --> 0:12:37,000
but the idea is that it will work in

309
0:12:34.54,000 --> 0:12:38,000
places like the United States and Europe

310
0:12:37.519,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and elsewhere where you know there's a

311
0:12:39.5,000 --> 0:12:43,000
good amount of wealth and people can

312
0:12:41.3,000 --> 0:12:44,000
stay indoors and you do and what you're

313
0:12:43.55,000 --> 0:12:46,000
doing is you're saving your healthcare

314
0:12:44.93,000 --> 0:12:47,000
system so you have to consider that

315
0:12:46.85,000 --> 0:12:5,000
there is the health care capacity there

316
0:12:48.56,000 --> 0:12:51,000
to some extent and so we want to save

317
0:12:50.899,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that so we're going to stay home just to

318
0:12:52.339,000 --> 0:12:55,000
slow down transmission so they're not

319
0:12:53.99,000 --> 0:12:56,000
overwhelmed but if you're looking at a

320
0:12:56.06,000 --> 0:13:,000
country where you don't have that

321
0:12:57.62,000 --> 0:13:01,000
capacity anyway you know places you know

322
0:13:00.41,000 --> 0:13:03,000
countries in some parts of Africa that

323
0:13:02.3,000 --> 0:13:06,000
may not have a lot of ICU beds and they

324
0:13:04.13,000 --> 0:13:09,000
don't have ventilators anyway and then

325
0:13:07.1,000 --> 0:13:12,000
also you know people aren't able to stay

326
0:13:09.62,000 --> 0:13:12,000
home and socially distance adequately

327
0:13:12.14,000 --> 0:13:15,000
because they're homeless or they're

328
0:13:13.399,000 --> 0:13:17,000
migrant laborers or you know whatever

329
0:13:15.32,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that you know lockdown maybe isn't the

330
0:13:18.35,000 --> 0:13:21,000
right approach it doesn't mean that

331
0:13:19.64,000 --> 0:13:23,000
there isn't other things they can do

332
0:13:22.31,000 --> 0:13:27,000
you know I think about like influenza in

333
0:13:24.44,000 --> 0:13:29,000
the United States and the most obvious

334
0:13:27.62,000 --> 0:13:32,000
thing to do because kids are sort of the

335
0:13:30.32,000 --> 0:13:34,000
main carrier of you know they they shed

336
0:13:32.93,000 --> 0:13:36,000
more flu virus they spread it more

337
0:13:34.64,000 --> 0:13:37,000
amongst themselves and they they get to

338
0:13:37.82,000 --> 0:13:41,000
vouch for that

339
0:13:38.39,000 --> 0:13:45,000
I have tickets for that yes so they're

340
0:13:42.35,000 --> 0:13:47,000
very germy with the flu but the most

341
0:13:45.529,000 --> 0:13:49,000
obvious thing to do then is okay well

342
0:13:47.839,000 --> 0:13:5,000
let's not touch our children during

343
0:13:49.55,000 --> 0:13:53,000
those six weeks of flu season or let's

344
0:13:51.83,000 --> 0:13:55,000
make them wear masks or let's keep them

345
0:13:53.9,000 --> 0:13:56,000
home from school you know there's we

346
0:13:55.91,000 --> 0:13:58,000
could isolate the kids don't hug your

347
0:13:57.5,000 --> 0:14:,000
kids you know we could make those kinds

348
0:13:59.54,000 --> 0:14:03,000
of recommendations and it would make

349
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
sense but it's not sensitive to the fact

350
0:14:04.46,000 --> 0:14:08,000
that these are people in our lives that

351
0:14:07.1,000 --> 0:14:1,000
we need to be connected to so we think

352
0:14:08.96,000 --> 0:14:12,000
of other ways to deal with it you know

353
0:14:10.82,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and so I I think there's I don't know

354
0:14:13.339,000 --> 0:14:18,000
what the answers are in a resource poor

355
0:14:15.74,000 --> 0:14:19,000
situation like how do you actually stand

356
0:14:18.44,000 --> 0:14:21,000
that but that doesn't mean there isn't

357
0:14:19.91,000 --> 0:14:24,000
better options we don't all have to do

358
0:14:22.1,000 --> 0:14:27,000
it the same way yeah are we so are there

359
0:14:25.88,000 --> 0:14:28,000
lessons that we can learn from past

360
0:14:27.38,000 --> 0:14:31,000
pandemics about what works I mean

361
0:14:29.15,000 --> 0:14:34,000
obviously Europe and let's say the 1600s

362
0:14:32.12,000 --> 0:14:37,000
when the plague is is floating around

363
0:14:34.37,000 --> 0:14:39,000
was was was kind of resource-poor and

364
0:14:37.79,000 --> 0:14:41,000
certainly understanding poor are there

365
0:14:40.13,000 --> 0:14:44,000
lessons we can learn from our from our

366
0:14:41.99,000 --> 0:14:46,000
ancestors or at least mistakes we can

367
0:14:44.51,000 --> 0:14:48,000
kind of avoid yeah I think I think more

368
0:14:47.51,000 --> 0:14:51,000
the latter and the stakes we can avoid I

369
0:14:49.13,000 --> 0:14:53,000
mean I think about sort of color in the

370
0:14:51.74,000 --> 0:14:55,000
19th century when it came to New York

371
0:14:53.51,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and it took you know they had evidence

372
0:14:56.57,000 --> 0:15:,000
that cholera was coming down the canal

373
0:14:59.089,000 --> 0:15:04,000
coming down the Erie Canal coming down

374
0:15:01.28,000 --> 0:15:05,000
the Hudson River into Manhattan they had

375
0:15:04.37,000 --> 0:15:07,000
they collected all that evidence like

376
0:15:05.9,000 --> 0:15:08,000
we've mapped it out and it's like so

377
0:15:07.82,000 --> 0:15:11,000
clear if you look at it today in

378
0:15:09.29,000 --> 0:15:14,000
retrospect right they knew that the

379
0:15:12.2,000 --> 0:15:15,000
water was contaminated with human waste

380
0:15:14.72,000 --> 0:15:17,000
they knew that would make them sick

381
0:15:16.19,000 --> 0:15:2,000
there was just all these opportunities

382
0:15:17.72,000 --> 0:15:22,000
to actually solve this problem but they

383
0:15:20.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
never did and they had 80 years of

384
0:15:22.93,000 --> 0:15:24,000
epidemics whereas thousands and

385
0:15:24.92,000 --> 0:15:27,000
thousands of people

386
0:15:25.76,000 --> 0:15:29,000
New Yorkers would die and they're you

387
0:15:28.13,000 --> 0:15:32,000
know just terrifying panda epidemics

388
0:15:30.38,000 --> 0:15:34,000
like what we're seeing today but in the

389
0:15:32.66,000 --> 0:15:35,000
end you know when they finally did clean

390
0:15:34.459,000 --> 0:15:36,000
up the water and

391
0:15:35.75,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Koller disappeared for good it wasn't

392
0:15:37.25,000 --> 0:15:43,000
for public health it was because brewers

393
0:15:41.03,000 --> 0:15:44,000
wanted better tasting water for their

394
0:15:43.31,000 --> 0:15:45,000
beer and they felt they were at a

395
0:15:44.78,000 --> 0:15:48,000
competitive disadvantage because

396
0:15:46.1,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Philadelphia had had Institute had had

397
0:15:48.8,000 --> 0:15:52,000
you know cleaned up their water supply

398
0:15:50.15,000 --> 0:15:55,000
so you know it so much is going to

399
0:15:53.36,000 --> 0:15:59,000
depend on the stories we tell about

400
0:15:55.87,000 --> 0:16:02,000
these diseases you know to think about

401
0:15:59.6,000 --> 0:16:04,000
cholera in London also and they you know

402
0:16:02.99,000 --> 0:16:06,000
because they thought that cholera is a

403
0:16:05.27,000 --> 0:16:1,000
problem of miasmas which were you know

404
0:16:07.61,000 --> 0:16:11,000
basically bad smells though they wanted

405
0:16:11.06,000 --> 0:16:14,000
to get rid of the bad smells so they

406
0:16:12.47,000 --> 0:16:16,000
installed flush toilets or what they

407
0:16:14.48,000 --> 0:16:18,000
called water closets but since they only

408
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
cared about the smell you know they

409
0:16:19.37,000 --> 0:16:22,000
installed the flush toilet because they

410
0:16:20.87,000 --> 0:16:23,000
didn't want the smell of human waste

411
0:16:22.55,000 --> 0:16:25,000
around their homes and alleys because

412
0:16:24.44,000 --> 0:16:29,000
they thought the smell would make them

413
0:16:25.97,000 --> 0:16:3,000
sick though so they started installing

414
0:16:29.78,000 --> 0:16:31,000
installing flush toilets get rid of all

415
0:16:31.49,000 --> 0:16:33,000
this stuff you know get rid of the

416
0:16:32.57,000 --> 0:16:35,000
smells but since all they cared about

417
0:16:34.28,000 --> 0:16:38,000
was the smell and not the contents they

418
0:16:36.53,000 --> 0:16:39,000
dumped all that into the River Thames

419
0:16:38.72,000 --> 0:16:42,000
which was of course their drinking water

420
0:16:40.19,000 --> 0:16:45,000
supply and so after every outbreak of

421
0:16:43.19,000 --> 0:16:47,000
cholera they installed more flush

422
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
toilets to dump more of their waste into

423
0:16:47.33,000 --> 0:16:52,000
the drinking water and made it you know

424
0:16:49.28,000 --> 0:16:54,000
progressively worse so so much depends

425
0:16:52.88,000 --> 0:16:55,000
on how we sort of characterize this

426
0:16:54.89,000 --> 0:16:58,000
disease like if we did characterizes

427
0:16:56.66,000 --> 0:17:,000
this disease as as you know some

428
0:16:59.51,000 --> 0:17:03,000
political leaders have done a Chinese

429
0:17:01.1,000 --> 0:17:05,000
virus you know then then what becomes

430
0:17:04.04,000 --> 0:17:07,000
our response our response is then okay

431
0:17:05.87,000 --> 0:17:1,000
well we should like close our borders

432
0:17:07.76,000 --> 0:17:12,000
and trade you know or do we or you know

433
0:17:10.97,000 --> 0:17:13,000
do we think of it as a problem of well

434
0:17:12.89,000 --> 0:17:15,000
too many people are travelling let's cut

435
0:17:14.449,000 --> 0:17:18,000
let's shut that down or do we think of

436
0:17:16.76,000 --> 0:17:2,000
it as you know people are invading

437
0:17:19.01,000 --> 0:17:22,000
wildlife habitat let's start conserving

438
0:17:20.81,000 --> 0:17:23,000
wildlife habitat so that doesn't happen

439
0:17:22.31,000 --> 0:17:25,000
you know there's there's all of these

440
0:17:24.709,000 --> 0:17:28,000
things all of these epidemics are

441
0:17:26.15,000 --> 0:17:3,000
multifactorial there's more than one you

442
0:17:28.76,000 --> 0:17:33,000
know there's a lot of pieces that come

443
0:17:30.56,000 --> 0:17:36,000
together so ultimately the stories we

444
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:38,000
tell are going to be really influential

445
0:17:36.74,000 --> 0:17:4,000
in the actions we'll take after this

446
0:17:38.57,000 --> 0:17:42,000
pandemic ends it's that cultural piece

447
0:17:41.21,000 --> 0:17:44,000
where we just need to get the Brewers

448
0:17:42.8,000 --> 0:17:45,000
involved and that America will take

449
0:17:44.36,000 --> 0:17:48,000
action but it looks like Whitney has a

450
0:17:46.429,000 --> 0:17:48,000
question

451
0:17:48.69,000 --> 0:17:51,000
now this is this is so fascinating and

452
0:17:50.549,000 --> 0:17:54,000
we have some questions coming in from

453
0:17:52.139,000 --> 0:17:56,000
the audience one of them is about you

454
0:17:54.6,000 --> 0:17:57,000
know in your point about this being

455
0:17:56.37,000 --> 0:18:01,000
multifactorial thinking about the

456
0:17:58.259,000 --> 0:18:03,000
climate crisis and how and why might

457
0:18:01.559,000 --> 0:18:07,000
that make infectious disease outbreaks

458
0:18:03.87,000 --> 0:18:09,000
more common yeah so I mean the thing

459
0:18:08.25,000 --> 0:18:15,000
about the climate change is it's gonna

460
0:18:10.679,000 --> 0:18:16,000
have a diverse effect on infectious

461
0:18:15.33,000 --> 0:18:19,000
disease epidemiology in some places

462
0:18:17.19,000 --> 0:18:21,000
there'll be more opportunities for

463
0:18:19.379,000 --> 0:18:22,000
pathogens to spread certain pathogens to

464
0:18:21.48,000 --> 0:18:24,000
spread in other places there might be

465
0:18:22.769,000 --> 0:18:26,000
less so malaria is a good example of

466
0:18:25.11,000 --> 0:18:29,000
that where malaria is carried by

467
0:18:26.789,000 --> 0:18:3,000
mosquitoes of course if you had say

468
0:18:29.19,000 --> 0:18:34,000
climate change means more precipitation

469
0:18:31.19,000 --> 0:18:36,000
in a place maybe that would mean that

470
0:18:34.23,000 --> 0:18:38,000
there'll be more puddles around so

471
0:18:36.509,000 --> 0:18:4,000
there'll be more breeding areas from

472
0:18:38.309,000 --> 0:18:42,000
mosquitoes and so that could mean that

473
0:18:40.529,000 --> 0:18:44,000
there will be more malaria or there

474
0:18:42.36,000 --> 0:18:45,000
could be more malaria but it also could

475
0:18:44.61,000 --> 0:18:47,000
mean that there'd be more flooding and

476
0:18:46.019,000 --> 0:18:49,000
if there's more flooding then that would

477
0:18:47.61,000 --> 0:18:51,000
wash more mosquito eggs away and so

478
0:18:49.86,000 --> 0:18:53,000
you'd have less mosquitoes and so then

479
0:18:52.08,000 --> 0:18:56,000
you might have less malaria around so

480
0:18:53.97,000 --> 0:18:58,000
the the impact is going to vary but I

481
0:18:56.7,000 --> 0:19:,000
think the main thing is that the

482
0:18:59.669,000 --> 0:19:01,000
opportunities for transmission are going

483
0:19:01.62,000 --> 0:19:04,000
to change

484
0:19:02.309,000 --> 0:19:06,000
so when disease happens in new places

485
0:19:04.83,000 --> 0:19:06,000
that's that's what we're gonna see is

486
0:19:06.36,000 --> 0:19:1,000
disease happening in new places

487
0:19:07.789,000 --> 0:19:11,000
meaning populations that haven't had

488
0:19:10.559,000 --> 0:19:13,000
those experiences before going to be

489
0:19:12.509,000 --> 0:19:15,000
having diseases and that's we know

490
0:19:14.46,000 --> 0:19:17,000
because of immunity you know when

491
0:19:16.289,000 --> 0:19:2,000
something's new to you you'll get more

492
0:19:17.97,000 --> 0:19:22,000
sick - overall I think the impact will

493
0:19:20.7,000 --> 0:19:24,000
be a higher burden of disease from

494
0:19:23.279,000 --> 0:19:26,000
infectious from infectious pathogens

495
0:19:25.379,000 --> 0:19:29,000
even as like in some places there might

496
0:19:26.909,000 --> 0:19:3,000
be less you know less of this one

497
0:19:29.46,000 --> 0:19:32,000
disease and more more of it somewhere

498
0:19:31.409,000 --> 0:19:36,000
else but the other factor is just

499
0:19:33.36,000 --> 0:19:38,000
wildlife is moving you know climate

500
0:19:36.84,000 --> 0:19:4,000
change is already scrambling migration

501
0:19:38.37,000 --> 0:19:43,000
patterns of people and also wildlife

502
0:19:41.039,000 --> 0:19:45,000
about 80% of the species that have been

503
0:19:43.59,000 --> 0:19:46,000
checked are actually moving they're

504
0:19:45.24,000 --> 0:19:49,000
shifting their ranges to you know

505
0:19:47.519,000 --> 0:19:51,000
maintain their what they're used to in

506
0:19:49.409,000 --> 0:19:53,000
terms of the climate and that's really

507
0:19:51.629,000 --> 0:19:54,000
good that's like what we want that

508
0:19:53.46,000 --> 0:19:56,000
that's going to help them survive but it

509
0:19:55.289,000 --> 0:19:58,000
also means that wildlife and human

510
0:19:57.33,000 --> 0:20:01,000
populations are going to come into new

511
0:19:58.95,000 --> 0:20:03,000
kinds of contact in those areas too

512
0:20:02.22,000 --> 0:20:06,000
and so we don't know how that's going to

513
0:20:04.74,000 --> 0:20:08,000
kind of play out in terms of infectious

514
0:20:06.87,000 --> 0:20:11,000
disease risks but certainly that will

515
0:20:09.27,000 --> 0:20:13,000
that will also play a role thank you

516
0:20:12.51,000 --> 0:20:14,000
I'll be back from there questions and

517
0:20:13.86,000 --> 0:20:16,000
I'd love to remind our audience online

518
0:20:15.45,000 --> 0:20:18,000
that you can lead questions in the chat

519
0:20:17.159,000 --> 0:20:2,000
function which is that little talk

520
0:20:19.2,000 --> 0:20:23,000
bubble on the upper right-hand side of

521
0:20:21.09,000 --> 0:20:26,000
your window I'll be back shortly

522
0:20:23.69,000 --> 0:20:28,000
so it sounds like we got a bring an end

523
0:20:26.94,000 --> 0:20:32,000
to the wildlife trade for one thing but

524
0:20:28.71,000 --> 0:20:34,000
let's let's turn to maybe a more more

525
0:20:33.27,000 --> 0:20:38,000
hopeful subject how does this how does a

526
0:20:35.46,000 --> 0:20:4,000
pandemic end based on you know examples

527
0:20:38.58,000 --> 0:20:42,000
from the past and how will we even know

528
0:20:40.919,000 --> 0:20:43,000
when the pandemic is is ending what

529
0:20:43.44,000 --> 0:20:47,000
would you point to what will be the

530
0:20:44.76,000 --> 0:20:51,000
initial signs and what are the quickest

531
0:20:47.549,000 --> 0:20:54,000
things to to end I mean I think here in

532
0:20:51.929,000 --> 0:20:57,000
the in the US it'll be you know we'll

533
0:20:55.2,000 --> 0:21:02,000
have once our hospitals can manage the

534
0:20:58.7,000 --> 0:21:04,000
number of cases that become severe on a

535
0:21:02.22,000 --> 0:21:06,000
on a sort of steady basis then we'll be

536
0:21:05.37,000 --> 0:21:08,000
able to relax some of our social

537
0:21:06.78,000 --> 0:21:1,000
distancing and we'll probably have to

538
0:21:09.27,000 --> 0:21:12,000
have intermittent you know social

539
0:21:11.19,000 --> 0:21:14,000
distancing a little bit here and there

540
0:21:12.659,000 --> 0:21:16,000
kind of coming and going but the way the

541
0:21:15.12,000 --> 0:21:19,000
way I see it is like you know we're in

542
0:21:16.89,000 --> 0:21:21,000
the Steep first wave and it's the most

543
0:21:19.53,000 --> 0:21:23,000
sort of violent and difficult part of

544
0:21:22.44,000 --> 0:21:26,000
this process of sort of a new pathogen

545
0:21:24.21,000 --> 0:21:3,000
kind of tearing through a susceptible

546
0:21:27.36,000 --> 0:21:31,000
population but as it proceeds more and

547
0:21:30.27,000 --> 0:21:34,000
more of us are going to become you know

548
0:21:32.159,000 --> 0:21:36,000
immune because we'll have had it or you

549
0:21:34.5,000 --> 0:21:38,000
know MIT some of us will perish from it

550
0:21:36.9,000 --> 0:21:39,000
of course we're going to lose people but

551
0:21:38.909,000 --> 0:21:42,000
most of us are going to be able to have

552
0:21:40.53,000 --> 0:21:46,000
it and recover or wait until there is a

553
0:21:43.89,000 --> 0:21:47,000
vaccine and then have exposure so you

554
0:21:46.74,000 --> 0:21:49,000
know we look at measles coming into

555
0:21:48.419,000 --> 0:21:51,000
North America I think about that a lot

556
0:21:49.95,000 --> 0:21:52,000
and how violent that was you know that

557
0:21:51.63,000 --> 0:21:56,000
was just such a such a violent

558
0:21:53.84,000 --> 0:21:59,000
confrontation and you know changed

559
0:21:57,000 --> 0:22:02,000
history entirely but then you know after

560
0:22:00.69,000 --> 0:22:03,000
those first waves that are so deadly

561
0:22:02.49,000 --> 0:22:06,000
measles then becomes a disease of

562
0:22:04.679,000 --> 0:22:08,000
childhood and we see that with malaria

563
0:22:07.11,000 --> 0:22:12,000
too which is you know an ongoing

564
0:22:08.96,000 --> 0:22:13,000
catastrophe that malaria killed so many

565
0:22:12.21,000 --> 0:22:15,000
people every year this is something

566
0:22:14.13,000 --> 0:22:18,000
we've known how to prevent

567
0:22:16.05,000 --> 0:22:2,000
entirely and cure with drugs for

568
0:22:18.15,000 --> 0:22:23,000
hundreds of years and still you know

569
0:22:21.03,000 --> 0:22:26,000
thousands and thousands of babies die of

570
0:22:23.22,000 --> 0:22:27,000
malaria every day every year and you

571
0:22:26.07,000 --> 0:22:3,000
know and this has been going on year

572
0:22:27.45,000 --> 0:22:31,000
after year after year but in places

573
0:22:30.27,000 --> 0:22:34,000
where there is a lot of malaria malaria

574
0:22:32.28,000 --> 0:22:37,000
is a disease of childhood so if you can

575
0:22:34.59,000 --> 0:22:38,000
survive those first and episodes of

576
0:22:38.22,000 --> 0:22:41,000
malaria

577
0:22:39.03,000 --> 0:22:44,000
you know before you're 2 years old then

578
0:22:41.6,000 --> 0:22:46,000
you'll you can live in a malaria society

579
0:22:44.91,000 --> 0:22:48,000
and malaria kill you that's you know

580
0:22:47.13,000 --> 0:22:5,000
it's much less likely to be able to kill

581
0:22:49.2,000 --> 0:22:52,000
you because you've acquired some

582
0:22:50.19,000 --> 0:22:54,000
immunity so it's it's I sort of see it

583
0:22:52.2,000 --> 0:22:56,000
as a process of slowly getting you know

584
0:22:54.78,000 --> 0:22:57,000
sunburn that turns into a tan you know

585
0:22:57.03,000 --> 0:23:01,000
you have to have to go through this the

586
0:22:58.65,000 --> 0:23:02,000
pain of that and sort of get to this

587
0:23:01.11,000 --> 0:23:05,000
level where like okay you can kind of

588
0:23:02.85,000 --> 0:23:07,000
withstand it and that'll be supplemented

589
0:23:05.46,000 --> 0:23:08,000
hopefully with vaccines so that not you

590
0:23:07.86,000 --> 0:23:1,000
know so not so many of us have to

591
0:23:09.3,000 --> 0:23:14,000
experience the actual like hardship of

592
0:23:11.79,000 --> 0:23:16,000
having to survive this pathogen yeah

593
0:23:14.7,000 --> 0:23:18,000
what but what does it look like so you

594
0:23:17.25,000 --> 0:23:2,000
talked about the cholera epidemic in

595
0:23:19.11,000 --> 0:23:23,000
Haiti what does it look like when when

596
0:23:20.79,000 --> 0:23:24,000
life returns to normal or does it does

597
0:23:23.79,000 --> 0:23:28,000
it ever return to normal are we

598
0:23:25.29,000 --> 0:23:31,000
typically kind of transformed as a

599
0:23:28.89,000 --> 0:23:32,000
society post pandemic well I think

600
0:23:31.35,000 --> 0:23:35,000
that's what's been so frustrating about

601
0:23:33.27,000 --> 0:23:37,000
writing about infectious diseases for

602
0:23:35.37,000 --> 0:23:39,000
all these years is that things don't

603
0:23:37.5,000 --> 0:23:41,000
change enough after we have these you

604
0:23:40.23,000 --> 0:23:44,000
know the I mean that's sort of the the

605
0:23:42.48,000 --> 0:23:47,000
deep lesson I've learned his like people

606
0:23:45.02,000 --> 0:23:5,000
society to undergo these horrible

607
0:23:47.91,000 --> 0:23:51,000
epidemics that are so disruptive and so

608
0:23:50.64,000 --> 0:23:54,000
deadly and we turn against each other

609
0:23:52.71,000 --> 0:23:55,000
and you know corrupt governments kind of

610
0:23:54.9,000 --> 0:23:58,000
take advantage of it and there's secrecy

611
0:23:56.64,000 --> 0:24:,000
all these things happen and it's it's

612
0:23:59.01,000 --> 0:24:03,000
very negative in a lot of ways but we

613
0:24:01.59,000 --> 0:24:04,000
come out of it we just bounce right back

614
0:24:03.15,000 --> 0:24:07,000
right back to business as usual and

615
0:24:05.4,000 --> 0:24:11,000
that's why pathogens are so successful

616
0:24:08.03,000 --> 0:24:13,000
you know in the end it's because we

617
0:24:11.49,000 --> 0:24:15,000
don't change our behavior we keep doing

618
0:24:13.71,000 --> 0:24:17,000
the same things and therefore they

619
0:24:16.08,000 --> 0:24:21,000
keeping there they're able to continue

620
0:24:18.21,000 --> 0:24:22,000
to exploit our our behaviors you know I

621
0:24:21.27,000 --> 0:24:24,000
think we're getting to a point now

622
0:24:22.86,000 --> 0:24:27,000
though that you know with this pandemic

623
0:24:25.17,000 --> 0:24:29,000
in particular where business as usual

624
0:24:28.11,000 --> 0:24:31,000
has been so disruptive

625
0:24:29.85,000 --> 0:24:33,000
that I think there's going to be a lot

626
0:24:31.679,000 --> 0:24:36,000
more political will to actually get to

627
0:24:34.049,000 --> 0:24:39,000
the root causes of you know why were at

628
0:24:37.26,000 --> 0:24:41,000
why we're being why we're so vulnerable

629
0:24:39.45,000 --> 0:24:43,000
to these new pathogens and what we can

630
0:24:41.97,000 --> 0:24:44,000
what can we do to prevent them and there

631
0:24:43.59,000 --> 0:24:49,000
is a lot of things we can do to minimize

632
0:24:45.84,000 --> 0:24:5,000
the risk of pandemics so that's a

633
0:24:49.89,000 --> 0:24:52,000
beautiful segue what are what are the

634
0:24:51.51,000 --> 0:24:55,000
things we can do to minimize the risk

635
0:24:53.1,000 --> 0:24:57,000
well so one of the things I talk about

636
0:24:55.799,000 --> 0:25:,000
in my book is that you know what I tried

637
0:24:57.66,000 --> 0:25:03,000
to what I tried to do is show how a

638
0:25:01.14,000 --> 0:25:05,000
microbe turns into a pandemic causing

639
0:25:03.69,000 --> 0:25:08,000
pathogen so you know starting from its

640
0:25:06.03,000 --> 0:25:11,000
environmental reservoir happy beneficial

641
0:25:09.33,000 --> 0:25:12,000
and it's known environment not causing

642
0:25:11.28,000 --> 0:25:15,000
any disease for anyone and then slowly

643
0:25:13.11,000 --> 0:25:19,000
adapt to the human body and becomes this

644
0:25:15.33,000 --> 0:25:21,000
very disruptive pathogen so so I wanted

645
0:25:19.62,000 --> 0:25:22,000
to look at that whole story and what I

646
0:25:21.63,000 --> 0:25:25,000
learned is that you we really know how

647
0:25:23.22,000 --> 0:25:28,000
that process unfolds we know a lot about

648
0:25:25.77,000 --> 0:25:29,000
how that process unfolds so what that

649
0:25:29.1,000 --> 0:25:32,000
means is while we can't tell which

650
0:25:30.69,000 --> 0:25:34,000
microbe is going to cause the next

651
0:25:32.25,000 --> 0:25:37,000
pandemic since we know how it happens we

652
0:25:35.159,000 --> 0:25:4,000
can predict where it's most likely to

653
0:25:37.47,000 --> 0:25:42,000
happen so you know infectious disease

654
0:25:40.5,000 --> 0:25:44,000
modelers have come up with hotspot mats

655
0:25:43.289,000 --> 0:25:46,000
you know basically a map of the world

656
0:25:44.76,000 --> 0:25:48,000
where places where there's a lot of

657
0:25:47.25,000 --> 0:25:51,000
invasion of wildlife habitat there's a

658
0:25:49.38,000 --> 0:25:53,000
lot of intensification of like factory

659
0:25:51.539,000 --> 0:25:54,000
farming a lot of slums a lot of flight

660
0:25:53.669,000 --> 0:25:57,000
connections you know these are the

661
0:25:55.47,000 --> 0:25:59,000
drivers of microbes turning into

662
0:25:58.14,000 --> 0:26:01,000
pandemic housing pathogens and so

663
0:25:59.97,000 --> 0:26:03,000
there's hotspots around the world and in

664
0:26:01.65,000 --> 0:26:05,000
those places we can actively surveil

665
0:26:04.02,000 --> 0:26:08,000
from microbes you know don't wait until

666
0:26:06.63,000 --> 0:26:1,000
a bunch of people start getting sick

667
0:26:08.28,000 --> 0:26:12,000
because that's when the pathogens

668
0:26:10.919,000 --> 0:26:13,000
already adapted to the human body it's

669
0:26:12.659,000 --> 0:26:15,000
already starting to spread it's already

670
0:26:14.07,000 --> 0:26:18,000
starting to spread exponentially and our

671
0:26:16.169,000 --> 0:26:19,000
response is linear you it's not gonna

672
0:26:18.09,000 --> 0:26:21,000
you know we're not gonna be able to

673
0:26:19.26,000 --> 0:26:23,000
catch up but you can actively look for

674
0:26:21.929,000 --> 0:26:24,000
microbes that might be changing you know

675
0:26:24.179,000 --> 0:26:27,000
might be evolving in certain ways and

676
0:26:25.83,000 --> 0:26:28,000
they do that through you know various

677
0:26:27.39,000 --> 0:26:31,000
sampling techniques looking at blood

678
0:26:29.22,000 --> 0:26:34,000
samples or scat from wild animals or you

679
0:26:32.13,000 --> 0:26:35,000
know taking blood from farmers bush meat

680
0:26:34.409,000 --> 0:26:39,000
hunters like people kind of on the front

681
0:26:36.12,000 --> 0:26:42,000
lines of interacting with microbes in

682
0:26:39.96,000 --> 0:26:42,000
this way and really look and see like

683
0:26:42.299,000 --> 0:26:44,000
which ones are changing and they

684
0:26:43.71,000 --> 0:26:47,000
you can just kind of tinker with the

685
0:26:45.27,000 --> 0:26:5,000
local situations so that it doesn't have

686
0:26:47.97,000 --> 0:26:52,000
those opportunities anymore and you know

687
0:26:50.97,000 --> 0:26:54,000
we were the USAID was funding that

688
0:26:53.309,000 --> 0:26:58,000
program was called predict it was like a

689
0:26:55.679,000 --> 0:26:59,000
ten year old program and over the course

690
0:26:58.559,000 --> 0:27:01,000
of ten years that scientists who are

691
0:27:00.6,000 --> 0:27:05,000
involved in that program fingered about

692
0:27:02.49,000 --> 0:27:07,000
nine hundred microbes that might be

693
0:27:06.39,000 --> 0:27:09,000
changing in ways that could cause

694
0:27:07.74,000 --> 0:27:12,000
pandemics and so that's the kind of like

695
0:27:09.929,000 --> 0:27:14,000
you know background invisible Public

696
0:27:13.11,000 --> 0:27:17,000
Health work that nobody hears about you

697
0:27:15.45,000 --> 0:27:19,000
know because when Public Health is

698
0:27:17.25,000 --> 0:27:21,000
really really successful like nothing

699
0:27:19.47,000 --> 0:27:22,000
happens you know students sort of you

700
0:27:21.299,000 --> 0:27:24,000
know that the the paradox of it all is

701
0:27:23.34,000 --> 0:27:27,000
like the great victory of Public Health

702
0:27:25.14,000 --> 0:27:29,000
is that oh nothing happened you know so

703
0:27:28.32,000 --> 0:27:31,000
the optics aren't great for public

704
0:27:29.789,000 --> 0:27:32,000
health but it's really important work so

705
0:27:31.77,000 --> 0:27:34,000
you know that's and that that's the kind

706
0:27:33.299,000 --> 0:27:36,000
of thing we could do if we had the

707
0:27:35.399,000 --> 0:27:38,000
political will and then of course

708
0:27:36.409,000 --> 0:27:39,000
protecting wildlife habitat

709
0:27:38.49,000 --> 0:27:41,000
you know conserving more wildlife

710
0:27:39.99,000 --> 0:27:43,000
habitat and thinking about the public

711
0:27:42.12,000 --> 0:27:45,000
health impact of development you know we

712
0:27:44.01,000 --> 0:27:47,000
know we think about sort of the

713
0:27:45.299,000 --> 0:27:48,000
environmental impact okay is this gonna

714
0:27:47.07,000 --> 0:27:5,000
you know cause runoff or you know

715
0:27:49.2,000 --> 0:27:52,000
whatever you know we'll look at sort of

716
0:27:50.88,000 --> 0:27:53,000
the environmental impact before we say

717
0:27:52.44,000 --> 0:27:56,000
yes okay you can build that house or

718
0:27:54.6,000 --> 0:27:58,000
that mine or expand that mall or

719
0:27:56.52,000 --> 0:27:59,000
whatever but we don't look at well what

720
0:27:58.919,000 --> 0:28:01,000
is the public health impact and maybe

721
0:28:00.36,000 --> 0:28:03,000
that's something we can add on you know

722
0:28:02.279,000 --> 0:28:06,000
and I think if we did that and we had a

723
0:28:04.32,000 --> 0:28:09,000
really holistic way of looking at how

724
0:28:06.649,000 --> 0:28:12,000
pathogens emerge like it would have a

725
0:28:09.62,000 --> 0:28:14,000
constraining effect on our expanding

726
0:28:13.14,000 --> 0:28:17,000
footprint on the landscape and that's

727
0:28:14.82,000 --> 0:28:2,000
ultimately really the the kind of deep

728
0:28:17.789,000 --> 0:28:25,000
driver of all this so Public Health is

729
0:28:20.97,000 --> 0:28:26,000
kind of the you know boy who didn't cry

730
0:28:26.37,000 --> 0:28:3,000
wolf and therefore it's very easy to

731
0:28:27.87,000 --> 0:28:32,000
forget about those programs right and

732
0:28:30.87,000 --> 0:28:34,000
but they're the only thing predict

733
0:28:33.33,000 --> 0:28:39,000
predict protecting us is is predict

734
0:28:35.789,000 --> 0:28:41,000
still still around or were we so foolish

735
0:28:39.659,000 --> 0:28:45,000
as to stop it the Trump administration

736
0:28:42.57,000 --> 0:28:48,000
cut it last year I think but I believe

737
0:28:46.049,000 --> 0:28:49,000
they had some anonymous donor who gave

738
0:28:48.6,000 --> 0:28:51,000
them a couple million dollars so they're

739
0:28:49.95,000 --> 0:28:52,000
doing a little bit more but this is

740
0:28:51.899,000 --> 0:28:54,000
something that obviously we're gonna

741
0:28:53.37,000 --> 0:28:57,000
need to beef up in the

742
0:28:55.2,000 --> 0:28:59,000
you know if we you know make some new

743
0:28:57.419,000 --> 0:29:01,000
prices in November and you know get a

744
0:28:59.82,000 --> 0:29:03,000
government and political leaders in

745
0:29:02.07,000 --> 0:29:06,000
place who understand the value of that

746
0:29:04.2,000 --> 0:29:08,000
kind of work and then of course we need

747
0:29:06.33,000 --> 0:29:1,000
to have our you know uplift our primary

748
0:29:08.97,000 --> 0:29:12,000
health care the people have more access

749
0:29:10.59,000 --> 0:29:14,000
to care and paid sick leave and you know

750
0:29:13.889,000 --> 0:29:17,000
all of those things so that when

751
0:29:15.059,000 --> 0:29:19,000
outbreaks do occur that we you know we

752
0:29:17.94,000 --> 0:29:2,000
don't have we don't have this kind of

753
0:29:19.86,000 --> 0:29:24,000
disruption and try to do that we're

754
0:29:21.779,000 --> 0:29:26,000
seeing right now and looks like Whitney

755
0:29:25.38,000 --> 0:29:28,000
is back with another question I have

756
0:29:27.21,000 --> 0:29:31,000
many more though Whitney if you if you

757
0:29:29.13,000 --> 0:29:33,000
are struggling no no no no there's

758
0:29:32.039,000 --> 0:29:35,000
there's a couple of interesting ones

759
0:29:33.299,000 --> 0:29:36,000
here in fact one that sort of takes

760
0:29:35.669,000 --> 0:29:39,000
things in a little bit of a different

761
0:29:36.929,000 --> 0:29:4,000
direction one person wrote in about how

762
0:29:39.99,000 --> 0:29:42,000
you wrote recently about another type of

763
0:29:41.85,000 --> 0:29:45,000
pandemic that of xenophobia and

764
0:29:43.74,000 --> 0:29:47,000
scapegoating and it's really interested

765
0:29:46.529,000 --> 0:29:5,000
to hear you talk more about that and

766
0:29:47.909,000 --> 0:29:54,000
sort of how we can combat that pattern

767
0:29:51.269,000 --> 0:29:58,000
of harassment yeah I mean this has been

768
0:29:55.529,000 --> 0:30:,000
sort of a hallmark of outbreaks of new

769
0:29:58.47,000 --> 0:30:02,000
disease you know since like hundreds of

770
0:30:01.08,000 --> 0:30:05,000
years ago as at least in the history

771
0:30:03.029,000 --> 0:30:07,000
that I've been writing about that you

772
0:30:05.639,000 --> 0:30:08,000
know a new disease comes out and nowhere

773
0:30:07.11,000 --> 0:30:11,000
people don't know why is it coming you

774
0:30:09.51,000 --> 0:30:12,000
know why is it spreading who why some

775
0:30:11.789,000 --> 0:30:14,000
people getting white other people aren't

776
0:30:13.2,000 --> 0:30:17,000
getting in and they start pointing their

777
0:30:15,000 --> 0:30:19,000
fingers at each other during the days of

778
0:30:17.94,000 --> 0:30:2,000
cholera it was you know the Irish

779
0:30:19.71,000 --> 0:30:23,000
immigrants who were blamed before the

780
0:30:21.389,000 --> 0:30:25,000
cholera after you know after they were

781
0:30:24.24,000 --> 0:30:26,000
blamed then it was the Muslims were

782
0:30:25.559,000 --> 0:30:29,000
blamed and then it was the Eastern

783
0:30:26.909,000 --> 0:30:31,000
Europeans who are blamed and so today we

784
0:30:29.909,000 --> 0:30:33,000
see people blaming the Chinese or maybe

785
0:30:32.19,000 --> 0:30:38,000
Asians writ large and of course there is

786
0:30:34.71,000 --> 0:30:4,000
a geography to where pathogens emerge

787
0:30:38.269,000 --> 0:30:44,000
but once they once they erupt their

788
0:30:41.519,000 --> 0:30:47,000
global you know as we clearly see today

789
0:30:44.519,000 --> 0:30:48,000
this thing is everywhere then as much as

790
0:30:47.639,000 --> 0:30:52,000
you know coronavirus might have

791
0:30:49.32,000 --> 0:30:54,000
originated in parts of China again this

792
0:30:53.159,000 --> 0:30:57,000
goes back to like what are the stories

793
0:30:54.63,000 --> 0:30:59,000
we tell about epidemics and contagions

794
0:30:57.299,000 --> 0:31:02,000
when we see a pathogen emerge somewhere

795
0:31:00.6,000 --> 0:31:04,000
else you know outside of our society we

796
0:31:03,000 --> 0:31:06,000
talk about it in a certain way when it's

797
0:31:05.279,000 --> 0:31:07,000
something that emerges right on our own

798
0:31:06.99,000 --> 0:31:08,000
soil in our own

799
0:31:08.039,000 --> 0:31:11,000
we talked about it in a totally

800
0:31:09.479,000 --> 0:31:14,000
different way do you look at for example

801
0:31:12.019,000 --> 0:31:17,000
antibiotic resistant bacteria this is a

802
0:31:14.909,000 --> 0:31:18,000
huge problem in the United States and

803
0:31:17.1,000 --> 0:31:21,000
it's directly linked to our completely

804
0:31:19.259,000 --> 0:31:24,000
irrational use of antibiotics not just

805
0:31:21.929,000 --> 0:31:26,000
in human medicine but in agriculture and

806
0:31:24.659,000 --> 0:31:28,000
you know we're already rapidly

807
0:31:27.479,000 --> 0:31:32,000
approaching the point where we'll have

808
0:31:29.22,000 --> 0:31:34,000
like unstoppable infections but we don't

809
0:31:32.7,000 --> 0:31:36,000
talk about it that way you know we don't

810
0:31:34.32,000 --> 0:31:37,000
talk about it as this like scary thing

811
0:31:36.72,000 --> 0:31:39,000
that's like growing and encroaching on

812
0:31:38.279,000 --> 0:31:43,000
us because it doesn't match this

813
0:31:40.639,000 --> 0:31:45,000
paradigm of invasion and encroachment

814
0:31:43.59,000 --> 0:31:47,000
that others are the ones they're the you

815
0:31:46.139,000 --> 0:31:5,000
know the the other people are the

816
0:31:47.639,000 --> 0:31:52,000
polluted polluted intruders who are

817
0:31:50.46,000 --> 0:31:54,000
contaminating us and we need to kind of

818
0:31:52.71,000 --> 0:31:58,000
close our borders and keep our pristine

819
0:31:55.019,000 --> 0:32:,000
you know pure a pure societies intact

820
0:31:58.71,000 --> 0:32:02,000
and keep all this contamination outside

821
0:32:00.599,000 --> 0:32:06,000
of us and I think that's sort of the

822
0:32:03.149,000 --> 0:32:09,000
general way we talk about pathogens and

823
0:32:07.229,000 --> 0:32:11,000
disease processes as a process of

824
0:32:09.509,000 --> 0:32:13,000
invasion really lends itself to

825
0:32:11.869,000 --> 0:32:15,000
scapegoating even if you don't have a

826
0:32:14.19,000 --> 0:32:18,000
political leader like we do in the

827
0:32:16.409,000 --> 0:32:2,000
United States who actually actively

828
0:32:18.269,000 --> 0:32:23,000
calls you know the virus a Chinese virus

829
0:32:21.33,000 --> 0:32:28,000
or you know it you know actively kind of

830
0:32:24.109,000 --> 0:32:29,000
engages and encourages scapegoating but

831
0:32:28.47,000 --> 0:32:31,000
I think the general way we even talk

832
0:32:29.879,000 --> 0:32:32,000
about diseases has to change you know we

833
0:32:31.889,000 --> 0:32:35,000
don't talk about HIV as the New York

834
0:32:33.869,000 --> 0:32:37,000
City virus even though it explored

835
0:32:36.029,000 --> 0:32:39,000
exploded in New York City we don't talk

836
0:32:37.889,000 --> 0:32:41,000
about methicillin-resistant

837
0:32:39.45,000 --> 0:32:44,000
staphylococcus aureus MRSA as you know

838
0:32:42.69,000 --> 0:32:48,000
the Boston plague even though that's

839
0:32:45.299,000 --> 0:32:5,000
where it exploded you know because we we

840
0:32:48.72,000 --> 0:32:52,000
named things as other and foreign when

841
0:32:51.21,000 --> 0:32:54,000
they're outside of us and I think that's

842
0:32:53.009,000 --> 0:32:58,000
part of trying to make us feel better

843
0:32:54.779,000 --> 0:32:58,000
about it and also I mean you know like

844
0:32:58.019,000 --> 0:33:04,000
externalizing the threat when really

845
0:32:59.759,000 --> 0:33:05,000
it's so much about our own behaviors and

846
0:33:04.619,000 --> 0:33:07,000
I'll I'll come back to join you guys at

847
0:33:05.82,000 --> 0:33:07,000
the very end

848
0:33:09.51,000 --> 0:33:15,000
that I think is a very important point

849
0:33:13.179,000 --> 0:33:17,000
point in that we're kind of an info

850
0:33:15.61,000 --> 0:33:18,000
demmick of sorts there's as much kind of

851
0:33:17.559,000 --> 0:33:23,000
missing misinformation with this

852
0:33:19.39,000 --> 0:33:25,000
pandemic as well as any I've ever seen

853
0:33:24.01,000 --> 0:33:28,000
are there examples from the past where

854
0:33:25.96,000 --> 0:33:29,000
we're kind of the rumors and the bad

855
0:33:28.96,000 --> 0:33:31,000
Intel

856
0:33:30.22,000 --> 0:33:34,000
kind of raced ahead of the pandemic or

857
0:33:32.32,000 --> 0:33:38,000
is that truly a feature of our kind of

858
0:33:35.11,000 --> 0:33:4,000
modern age oh no I don't think it's a

859
0:33:38.83,000 --> 0:33:41,000
feature of our modern age at all like

860
0:33:40.419,000 --> 0:33:45,000
that you know that was not there was

861
0:33:42.57,000 --> 0:33:48,000
rumors and like secrecy and all of that

862
0:33:46.059,000 --> 0:33:51,000
was is definitely very much a part of

863
0:33:49.09,000 --> 0:33:54,000
epidemics of the past I mean I was just

864
0:33:51.73,000 --> 0:33:56,000
I think a lot about an epidemic of

865
0:33:54.429,000 --> 0:34:,000
cholera that happened in Italy in 1911

866
0:33:57.61,000 --> 0:34:03,000
or so and that it was on the eve of the

867
0:34:00.97,000 --> 0:34:05,000
I think was a 50th anniversary of the

868
0:34:04.149,000 --> 0:34:07,000
country of the state of Italy and so

869
0:34:06.399,000 --> 0:34:08,000
there's these big you know big

870
0:34:07.75,000 --> 0:34:11,000
celebrations planned and then cholera

871
0:34:09.28,000 --> 0:34:13,000
erupted in Naples and the government

872
0:34:11.98,000 --> 0:34:15,000
basically just decided to keep it a

873
0:34:13.659,000 --> 0:34:16,000
secret I mean it was still spreading and

874
0:34:16.33,000 --> 0:34:19,000
you know people are getting sick and

875
0:34:17.5,000 --> 0:34:2,000
people are dying but they kind of paid

876
0:34:19.419,000 --> 0:34:23,000
off newspaper reporters not to mention

877
0:34:21.25,000 --> 0:34:25,000
it and they intercepted telegrams that

878
0:34:24.04,000 --> 0:34:29,000
had the word collaring in the you know

879
0:34:26.08,000 --> 0:34:31,000
censored those they it was in cahoots

880
0:34:29.53,000 --> 0:34:32,000
with other international leaders you

881
0:34:31.21,000 --> 0:34:34,000
know in the United States and in France

882
0:34:32.859,000 --> 0:34:34,000
they knew and they said okay we're just

883
0:34:34.24,000 --> 0:34:38,000
not gonna you know let's just not

884
0:34:35.649,000 --> 0:34:4,000
mention it you know and you know in the

885
0:34:38.679,000 --> 0:34:43,000
absence of sort of authoritative

886
0:34:41.399,000 --> 0:34:45,000
accurate information from the top the

887
0:34:44.26,000 --> 0:34:47,000
all kinds of rumors spread

888
0:34:46.149,000 --> 0:34:49,000
you know oh it's people are dying from

889
0:34:47.889,000 --> 0:34:5,000
eating watermelons people are dying from

890
0:34:49.54,000 --> 0:34:53,000
eating strawberries people are dying too

891
0:34:51.19,000 --> 0:34:55,000
all different because it cuz you don't

892
0:34:54.159,000 --> 0:34:57,000
know you don't know there's just this

893
0:34:55.51,000 --> 0:34:59,000
vacuum but you know something is

894
0:34:57.25,000 --> 0:35:02,000
happening and I think right now because

895
0:34:59.83,000 --> 0:35:03,000
there you know there are some mixed

896
0:35:02.47,000 --> 0:35:05,000
messaging there is some Mis mixed

897
0:35:04.54,000 --> 0:35:07,000
messaging coming from our political

898
0:35:06.13,000 --> 0:35:12,000
leaders where some are saying oh it's a

899
0:35:08.53,000 --> 0:35:14,000
oh it's very serious is kind of the fog

900
0:35:12.849,000 --> 0:35:15,000
of war you know there's a lot of

901
0:35:14.71,000 --> 0:35:18,000
uncertainty right now and so it's

902
0:35:16.33,000 --> 0:35:21,000
understandable but that definitely lends

903
0:35:19.42,000 --> 0:35:23,000
itself to the rumors and misinformation

904
0:35:21.55,000 --> 0:35:24,000
you know just like in you

905
0:35:23.42,000 --> 0:35:26,000
eight 19th century when people blame

906
0:35:25.309,000 --> 0:35:29,000
diseases on Irish immigrants you know

907
0:35:27.41,000 --> 0:35:32,000
that that was that was basically a

908
0:35:29.63,000 --> 0:35:34,000
made-up idea also right well we we

909
0:35:33.019,000 --> 0:35:38,000
certainly saw that early on in this

910
0:35:35.21,000 --> 0:35:41,000
pandemic you know China was not exactly

911
0:35:38.42,000 --> 0:35:42,000
transparent in the early days and that's

912
0:35:41.869,000 --> 0:35:44,000
a feature you know going back to the

913
0:35:43.369,000 --> 0:35:46,000
Spanish flu which is only called the

914
0:35:45.049,000 --> 0:35:49,000
Spanish flu because as I understand that

915
0:35:47.329,000 --> 0:35:5,000
Spain was the only one to kind of openly

916
0:35:49.369,000 --> 0:35:54,000
talk about it but it's thought that it

917
0:35:51.23,000 --> 0:35:55,000
actually originated in the US right yeah

918
0:35:55.16,000 --> 0:35:57,000
I'm not sure where it actually

919
0:35:56.18,000 --> 0:36:,000
originated somewhere in the Americas but

920
0:35:57.97,000 --> 0:36:02,000
but yeah it's vanished blue became sort

921
0:36:01.069,000 --> 0:36:04,000
of you know the Spain got blamed for the

922
0:36:03.2,000 --> 0:36:07,000
whole thing even though it didn't even

923
0:36:04.369,000 --> 0:36:1,000
originate there so that is a recurring

924
0:36:07.91,000 --> 0:36:12,000
feature are there kind of common

925
0:36:11.119,000 --> 0:36:14,000
responses that we have to these

926
0:36:13.549,000 --> 0:36:16,000
pandemics that kind of repeat themselves

927
0:36:15.109,000 --> 0:36:21,000
over and over again that we could maybe

928
0:36:16.91,000 --> 0:36:23,000
avoid next time around because it seems

929
0:36:21.349,000 --> 0:36:28,000
like end mxr are going are are a feature

930
0:36:24.559,000 --> 0:36:31,000
of human existence I mean I think they

931
0:36:29.269,000 --> 0:36:36,000
are in a way but you know they are also

932
0:36:32.15,000 --> 0:36:39,000
manufactured by our political choices so

933
0:36:36.589,000 --> 0:36:4,000
I think we can we can't get rid of

934
0:36:39.74,000 --> 0:36:43,000
infectious diseases

935
0:36:41,000 --> 0:36:46,000
we'll always have those will always have

936
0:36:44.049,000 --> 0:36:49,000
outbreaks and epidemics here and there

937
0:36:46.73,000 --> 0:36:51,000
but we don't have to spread them around

938
0:36:49.309,000 --> 0:36:53,000
the world rapidly in a pandemic I don't

939
0:36:52.309,000 --> 0:36:55,000
think so you know Larry brilliant

940
0:36:53.619,000 --> 0:36:58,000
epidemiologists had this great quote

941
0:36:55.549,000 --> 0:37:,000
which I used a lot but he said

942
0:36:58.64,000 --> 0:37:02,000
infectious diseases are inevitable but

943
0:37:00.71,000 --> 0:37:04,000
pandemics are optional and I think that

944
0:37:03.47,000 --> 0:37:08,000
is right you know we don't have to

945
0:37:05.359,000 --> 0:37:1,000
spread these around so rapidly and we

946
0:37:08.75,000 --> 0:37:13,000
don't have to create that basically

947
0:37:11.329,000 --> 0:37:16,000
built we're building highways for these

948
0:37:14.24,000 --> 0:37:18,000
microbes to enter the human body and

949
0:37:16.64,000 --> 0:37:19,000
then we're distributing them around the

950
0:37:18.319,000 --> 0:37:24,000
globe you know in the most efficient way

951
0:37:20.269,000 --> 0:37:27,000
possible and yet you know and for me

952
0:37:24.349,000 --> 0:37:29,000
like the spread you know the Travel

953
0:37:27.74,000 --> 0:37:32,000
Network is also part of the solution

954
0:37:29.779,000 --> 0:37:34,000
right because yes that spreads disease

955
0:37:33.619,000 --> 0:37:36,000
but it also spreads cures it also

956
0:37:35.119,000 --> 0:37:39,000
spreads knowledge and innovation

957
0:37:36.869,000 --> 0:37:4,000
so to me there's all of these risk

958
0:37:39.299,000 --> 0:37:43,000
factors are theirs costs and benefits

959
0:37:41.19,000 --> 0:37:47,000
and you have to weigh those so to me

960
0:37:43.859,000 --> 0:37:48,000
movement is is it's so beneficial also

961
0:37:47.369,000 --> 0:37:51,000
that you know I think that maybe

962
0:37:49.2,000 --> 0:37:54,000
outweighs the cost but there's a lot of

963
0:37:51.69,000 --> 0:37:55,000
other things we can do you know in terms

964
0:37:54.72,000 --> 0:37:57,000
of being prepared for the next epidemic

965
0:37:56.549,000 --> 0:38:,000
but also just minimizing the risk that's

966
0:37:58.259,000 --> 0:38:03,000
going to happen at all you know I mean

967
0:38:00.96,000 --> 0:38:06,000
Quran the coronavirus family is obvious

968
0:38:03.299,000 --> 0:38:09,000
candidate like this this virus is the

969
0:38:07.38,000 --> 0:38:13,000
same species of the SARS virus that came

970
0:38:10.049,000 --> 0:38:15,000
out in 2002 so you know once we can

971
0:38:13.65,000 --> 0:38:16,000
better understand where these things are

972
0:38:15.42,000 --> 0:38:2,000
coming from and what is the exact sort

973
0:38:17.16,000 --> 0:38:23,000
of pathway we can we can start to

974
0:38:20.64,000 --> 0:38:25,000
rearrange those so that it becomes less

975
0:38:23.369,000 --> 0:38:27,000
likely that you know these pathogens

976
0:38:25.74,000 --> 0:38:29,000
label to take it to exploit these

977
0:38:27.45,000 --> 0:38:31,000
pathways we've created for them right

978
0:38:30.029,000 --> 0:38:35,000
and and looking at history is it that

979
0:38:32.16,000 --> 0:38:37,000
pandemics kind of follow these waves of

980
0:38:35.13,000 --> 0:38:4,000
the globalization or is it more

981
0:38:37.799,000 --> 0:38:42,000
complicated than that yeah I think that

982
0:38:40.619,000 --> 0:38:44,000
is true I mean you look at you know

983
0:38:42.96,000 --> 0:38:45,000
cholera is the one I wrote about the

984
0:38:45.18,000 --> 0:38:48,000
most because it's one of our most

985
0:38:46.319,000 --> 0:38:51,000
successful pandemic causing pathogens

986
0:38:48.45,000 --> 0:38:53,000
it's caused famine global pandemics and

987
0:38:51.539,000 --> 0:38:56,000
I think there's an eighth one sort of

988
0:38:53.579,000 --> 0:38:57,000
brewing most likely but yeah it

989
0:38:56.7,000 --> 0:38:59,000
definitely took advantage of you know

990
0:38:58.44,000 --> 0:39:02,000
19th century travel patterns of the new

991
0:39:00.269,000 --> 0:39:04,000
canals and steamships and you know the

992
0:39:02.519,000 --> 0:39:07,000
Industrial Age was really something that

993
0:39:04.499,000 --> 0:39:09,000
cholera took advantage of and you know

994
0:39:08.039,000 --> 0:39:12,000
we see with like stars for example in

995
0:39:10.17,000 --> 0:39:14,000
2002 would never have gotten out of

996
0:39:12.14,000 --> 0:39:16,000
South China and Hong Kong if it weren't

997
0:39:14.759,000 --> 0:39:17,000
you know it reached Hong Kong which like

998
0:39:16.799,000 --> 0:39:19,000
critical because that was that's an

999
0:39:18.69,000 --> 0:39:21,000
international flight hub and then from

1000
0:39:20.19,000 --> 0:39:24,000
there was able to be carried out in

1001
0:39:22.17,000 --> 0:39:26,000
flights to like dozens of other

1002
0:39:24.299,000 --> 0:39:28,000
countries and same with Zika you know

1003
0:39:26.999,000 --> 0:39:29,000
Zika you know wouldn't have made it over

1004
0:39:28.98,000 --> 0:39:31,000
to the Americas except for international

1005
0:39:30.839,000 --> 0:39:33,000
sporting events and things like that so

1006
0:39:32.339,000 --> 0:39:36,000
everyone kind of come in suddenly coming

1007
0:39:34.2,000 --> 0:39:38,000
together creates these great

1008
0:39:36.839,000 --> 0:39:4,000
opportunities for pathogens to spread

1009
0:39:38.809,000 --> 0:39:44,000
but at the same time you know you can

1010
0:39:41.73,000 --> 0:39:46,000
actually predict like where and this has

1011
0:39:44.819,000 --> 0:39:48,000
been mapped out in really beautiful maps

1012
0:39:47.009,000 --> 0:39:5,000
where if you have like a map of the

1013
0:39:49.41,000 --> 0:39:52,000
world and you do

1014
0:39:50.61,000 --> 0:39:54,000
flu you simulate a flu pandemic on it

1015
0:39:52.8,000 --> 0:39:55,000
you know the you know they'll be like a

1016
0:39:54.69,000 --> 0:39:56,000
little red dot in one place where is

1017
0:39:56.22,000 --> 0:40:,000
infection and then it kind of just

1018
0:39:57.66,000 --> 0:40:02,000
spreads kind of seemingly randomly

1019
0:40:00.36,000 --> 0:40:05,000
around the globe until it's everyone's

1020
0:40:02.7,000 --> 0:40:07,000
gotten it if you take that same map and

1021
0:40:05.58,000 --> 0:40:1,000
you map out all the cities in terms of

1022
0:40:08.43,000 --> 0:40:13,000
their direct flight connections and then

1023
0:40:11.04,000 --> 0:40:15,000
run that same stimulated flu pandemic on

1024
0:40:13.89,000 --> 0:40:17,000
that kind of map it resolves into this

1025
0:40:15.93,000 --> 0:40:2,000
like beautiful perfect series of waves

1026
0:40:18.42,000 --> 0:40:24,000
because you can literally predict which

1027
0:40:21.23,000 --> 0:40:25,000
Divi will be infected next just based on

1028
0:40:24.78,000 --> 0:40:28,000
the number of direct flights between

1029
0:40:26.13,000 --> 0:40:31,000
uninfected and infected cities so you

1030
0:40:29.4,000 --> 0:40:32,000
know the way we travel is hugely

1031
0:40:31.32,000 --> 0:40:36,000
influential in sort of the shape of

1032
0:40:33.12,000 --> 0:40:38,000
these pandemics and how they unfold so

1033
0:40:36.96,000 --> 0:40:39,000
it looks like we we have to wrap up but

1034
0:40:38.85,000 --> 0:40:41,000
I want to I want to ask one final

1035
0:40:40.53,000 --> 0:40:44,000
question which is you know you've

1036
0:40:42.72,000 --> 0:40:47,000
studied all these past pandemics what

1037
0:40:45.45,000 --> 0:40:5,000
gives you what gives you hope from from

1038
0:40:48.06,000 --> 0:40:51,000
what you've learned what you've seen

1039
0:40:52.3,000 --> 0:40:57,000
two things one is maybe a little darker

1040
0:40:56.48,000 --> 0:40:58,000
than the second one so I'll I'll start

1041
0:40:58.13,000 --> 0:41:01,000
with the dark :

1042
0:40:58.97,000 --> 0:41:02,000
what is that pathogens have to balance

1043
0:41:01.31,000 --> 0:41:05,000
their transmissibility and their

1044
0:41:03.68,000 --> 0:41:06,000
virulence you know if you have a

1045
0:41:06.08,000 --> 0:41:09,000
pathogen and this is just from the

1046
0:41:07.61,000 --> 0:41:11,000
pathogens point of view you know to

1047
0:41:09.29,000 --> 0:41:13,000
survive they have to spread from one

1048
0:41:12.41,000 --> 0:41:15,000
host to the next and they have to

1049
0:41:13.97,000 --> 0:41:16,000
replicate within that host so that they

1050
0:41:15.62,000 --> 0:41:18,000
you know their populations get stronger

1051
0:41:17.3,000 --> 0:41:2,000
and bigger so they need to do both of

1052
0:41:18.98,000 --> 0:41:22,000
those things and that's the tension for

1053
0:41:20.99,000 --> 0:41:24,000
them because if they're too virulent if

1054
0:41:23.21,000 --> 0:41:27,000
they replicate too fast then their host

1055
0:41:25.1,000 --> 0:41:3,000
is gonna get so sick and maybe even die

1056
0:41:28.15,000 --> 0:41:31,000
and then they're not gonna be able to

1057
0:41:30.2,000 --> 0:41:34,000
carry them to the next person you know a

1058
0:41:32.09,000 --> 0:41:36,000
dead host or a sick host is isolated

1059
0:41:34.7,000 --> 0:41:37,000
they're not interacting with other

1060
0:41:36.26,000 --> 0:41:4,000
people as much so there's much fewer

1061
0:41:38.45,000 --> 0:41:42,000
transmission opportunities to sort of in

1062
0:41:40.67,000 --> 0:41:44,000
the pathogens interest to not be so

1063
0:41:43.31,000 --> 0:41:46,000
virulent that you can't get carried on

1064
0:41:45.62,000 --> 0:41:48,000
you know that you end up in sort of a

1065
0:41:47.09,000 --> 0:41:51,000
dead end host essentially so they have

1066
0:41:48.98,000 --> 0:41:53,000
to balance those two things out so

1067
0:41:52.04,000 --> 0:41:56,000
that's just a way I cope with had the

1068
0:41:54.86,000 --> 0:41:58,000
fact that we live in a world of

1069
0:41:56.48,000 --> 0:41:59,000
pathogens around us you know is is it's

1070
0:41:59.24,000 --> 0:42:02,000
not really in their interest

1071
0:42:00.28,000 --> 0:42:04,000
evolutionarily speaking to be like

1072
0:42:02.78,000 --> 0:42:05,000
really really deadly that's that's why I

1073
0:42:05.03,000 --> 0:42:08,000
saw it the first stars died out that

1074
0:42:06.71,000 --> 0:42:1,000
that virus is extinct now it basically

1075
0:42:08.87,000 --> 0:42:12,000
just burnt itself out because it was it

1076
0:42:11.63,000 --> 0:42:15,000
wasn't very it wasn't transmissible

1077
0:42:13.61,000 --> 0:42:17,000
enough it was too deadly so that's

1078
0:42:16.28,000 --> 0:42:19,000
something that I always kind of keep in

1079
0:42:17.75,000 --> 0:42:21,000
mind is it just in terms of like

1080
0:42:20.03,000 --> 0:42:24,000
perspective it helps me but the other

1081
0:42:22.58,000 --> 0:42:26,000
thing is I think what we're seeing today

1082
0:42:24.65,000 --> 0:42:28,000
is you know people really coming

1083
0:42:26.93,000 --> 0:42:3,000
together because we don't have

1084
0:42:29.02,000 --> 0:42:34,000
technology you know when we have a tool

1085
0:42:31.46,000 --> 0:42:36,000
when we have a product then we can more

1086
0:42:34.31,000 --> 0:42:37,000
easily say well I'm just gonna get my

1087
0:42:36.5,000 --> 0:42:39,000
piece of it I'm going to get my

1088
0:42:37.76,000 --> 0:42:4,000
prescription and my pill and my vaccine

1089
0:42:39.77,000 --> 0:42:42,000
in my shot and then you know I don't

1090
0:42:41.15,000 --> 0:42:45,000
need to mind what other people are doing

1091
0:42:43.46,000 --> 0:42:47,000
it's not going to matter as much to me

1092
0:42:45.56,000 --> 0:42:49,000
it becomes a very individual response

1093
0:42:47.62,000 --> 0:42:5,000
and I think what we're seeing today is

1094
0:42:49.76,000 --> 0:42:52,000
the need for collective action and

1095
0:42:51.32,000 --> 0:42:54,000
solidarity and we're seeing that across

1096
0:42:52.91,000 --> 0:42:55,000
societies you know with you know

1097
0:42:54.95,000 --> 0:42:57,000
governments sharing information

1098
0:42:56.6,000 --> 0:43:,000
scientists and collaborating and whole

1099
0:42:58.94,000 --> 0:43:01,000
new ways that we haven't seen before you

1100
0:43:00.92,000 --> 0:43:03,000
know global populations collaborating

1101
0:43:02.69,000 --> 0:43:06,000
and connecting and all these

1102
0:43:03.95,000 --> 0:43:07,000
new ways and sort of having this common

1103
0:43:06.71,000 --> 0:43:1,000
experience this shared experience it's a

1104
0:43:08.87,000 --> 0:43:12,000
tragic experience it's going to be so

1105
0:43:11.12,000 --> 0:43:15,000
traumatic for so many of us but we're

1106
0:43:13.43,000 --> 0:43:17,000
all going through it together and I and

1107
0:43:15.23,000 --> 0:43:19,000
I'm hopeful that out of that something

1108
0:43:17.51,000 --> 0:43:22,000
good will come for all of us

1109
0:43:19.51,000 --> 0:43:25,000
me too well thank you so much for

1110
0:43:23.24,000 --> 0:43:29,000
joining us and sharing your insights and

1111
0:43:26.21,000 --> 0:43:31,000
wisdom Sonya I'm gonna say goodbye

1112
0:43:29.84,000 --> 0:43:33,000
because I think we're out of time is

1113
0:43:31.79,000 --> 0:43:35,000
that right Whitney yeah that's right

1114
0:43:34.13,000 --> 0:43:37,000
thank you so much Sonya it was really

1115
0:43:36.14,000 --> 0:43:4,000
great to have you and to hear your

1116
0:43:37.7,000 --> 0:43:41,000
conversation but David here be well by

1117
0:43:40.91,000 --> 0:43:44,000
Sonya

1118
0:43:41.86,000 --> 0:43:44,000
they say it's

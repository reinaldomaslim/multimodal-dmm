1
0:00:12.4,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'm Chris Nowinski, and odds are if you've met me in the last five years

2
0:00:16.88,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I've asked you, after a few minutes, a bit of an odd question:

3
0:00:20.24,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Can I have your brain?

4
0:00:22.52,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Now, it only seems like a strange question if you don't know my story

5
0:00:25.8,000 --> 0:00:26,000
so please let me share it with you.

6
0:00:28.239,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I grew up outside of Chicago, and I was an athlete

7
0:00:31.52,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and I was very lucky to get recruited to play football at Harvard University.

8
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:37,000
So that's me.

9
0:00:37.56,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And then after graduating, like most Harvard graduates,

10
0:00:40.2,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I decided I wanted to join the WWE.

11
0:00:43.56,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So that's also me.

12
0:00:44.8,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:47.24,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Sure you remember me from Monday Night Raw in 2002 and 2003,

14
0:00:50.96,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and I had a blast

15
0:00:52.44,000 --> 0:00:54,000
playing what people affectionately like to call

16
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Chris Harvard, the Ivy League snob.

17
0:00:57.2,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:,000
It was perfect for me.

19
0:01:00.32,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But unfortunately,

20
0:01:02.44,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I got kicked in the head by my colleague Bubba Ray Dudley,

21
0:01:06.32,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and I suffered a severe concussion.

22
0:01:08.32,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And it led to what became permanent postconcussion symptoms:

23
0:01:12.68,000 --> 0:01:16,000
constant headaches, inability to sleep, depression, feeling in a fog.

24
0:01:17.36,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And in that first year,

25
0:01:18.64,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I tried to figure out how could I make this pain go away.

26
0:01:22.12,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And I wasn't getting the answers I needed from doctors,

27
0:01:24.76,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and so I started digging into the medical literature.

28
0:01:27.44,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And I found there's this whole story about concussions

29
0:01:30.04,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that we weren't really being told.

30
0:01:31.72,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So I decided to write a book about it,

31
0:01:33.6,000 --> 0:01:35,000
called "Head Games: Football's Concussion Crisis"

32
0:01:35.96,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that came out in 2006.

33
0:01:37.2,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But in that process, I learned it's not really just about concussions.

34
0:01:40.52,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I learned about a disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE.

35
0:01:45.76,000 --> 0:01:49,000
What we used to call punch-drunk, because we only knew about it from boxers.

36
0:01:49.92,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We knew that getting hit in the head too many times with boxers

37
0:01:53.56,000 --> 0:01:57,000
would cause their brain to essentially start to rot, to degenerate.

38
0:01:57.68,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And they'd have symptoms

39
0:01:58.92,000 --> 0:02:,000
like memory problems and problems with cognition,

40
0:02:01.36,000 --> 0:02:04,000
depression, impulse control issues, aggression.

41
0:02:05.32,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So basically, I got ...

42
0:02:09.48,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I got injured at the right time,

43
0:02:11.36,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in which the first two NFL players were studied for this disease.

44
0:02:15.92,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And it turned out they both had it.

45
0:02:17.68,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The first was Mike Webster, 50 years old, already had dementia.

46
0:02:21.52,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The second, Terry Long, 45 years old when he took his life.

47
0:02:26.36,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The medical examiner in Pittsburgh decided to look at their brains

48
0:02:30.24,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and found this disease.

49
0:02:31.8,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I wrote a chapter about it,

50
0:02:33.6,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and I thought people would make a big deal out of it.

51
0:02:36.12,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But shockingly, even when the first two cases came in positive,

52
0:02:39.2,000 --> 0:02:41,000
there was never a national news story about this,

53
0:02:42.2,000 --> 0:02:44,000
what's going on in football with these cases of CTE.

54
0:02:45.08,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So the book comes out,

55
0:02:47.32,000 --> 0:02:48,000
not a whole lot is happening,

56
0:02:48.96,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and one day I read the newspaper -- November 20, 2006.

57
0:02:53.44,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I find out that Andre Waters just took his life.

58
0:02:57.08,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Those of you who know football,

59
0:02:58.64,000 --> 0:03:,000
Andre Waters was someone I grew up watching.

60
0:03:00.76,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Former Philadelphia Eagles strong safety,

61
0:03:02.76,000 --> 0:03:04,000
[44] years old, a Division II football coach

62
0:03:05.56,000 --> 0:03:06,000
when he decided to put a gun to his head.

63
0:03:08.28,000 --> 0:03:1,000
In the article they reminded me, his nickname was Dirty Waters.

64
0:03:11.28,000 --> 0:03:12,000
He was known for leading with his head,

65
0:03:13.2,000 --> 0:03:14,000
so I thought I'm just going to look up

66
0:03:15.08,000 --> 0:03:17,000
did he ever talk about the concussions he had.

67
0:03:17.28,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And I found a quote from 1994 where Andre Waters said,

68
0:03:20.6,000 --> 0:03:22,000
"I stopped counting my concussions at 15.

69
0:03:23.08,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I wouldn't say anything, I'd just sniff smelling salts and go back out there."

70
0:03:26.8,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And I thought, I wonder if he might have CTE, too.

71
0:03:30.44,000 --> 0:03:33,000
If that might have contributed to whatever made him choose to end his life.

72
0:03:34.36,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So I ended up calling the doctor who did the first two studies, and I said,

73
0:03:37.92,000 --> 0:03:4,000
"Hey, I think you should study Andre Waters."

74
0:03:41.36,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And he said, "I'd be happy to.

75
0:03:44.2,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The problem is, the first two cases died in the county in which I work,

76
0:03:47.72,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and I could study them as part of my job.

77
0:03:49.76,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I can't do that with Andre Waters, he died in Florida.

78
0:03:52.72,000 --> 0:03:54,000
If you want me to study him, you're going to have to figure out

79
0:03:55.72,000 --> 0:03:57,000
how to get me the brain."

80
0:03:57.76,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So I said, "OK.

81
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:02,000
How does one get a brain?"

82
0:04:03.24,000 --> 0:04:05,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:05.32,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So I racked my brain

84
0:04:07.4,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and I thought, why don't I call the medical examiner

85
0:04:09.88,000 --> 0:04:1,000
who I think has the brain right now?

86
0:04:11.64,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So I called up the medical examiner in Florida, and I said,

87
0:04:14.44,000 --> 0:04:17,000
"Hey, you don't know me, but do you still have the brain of Andre Waters?"

88
0:04:18.44,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:19.92,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And he said, "Yes, I do."

90
0:04:22.24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I said, "OK, are you going to study him for CTE?"

91
0:04:26.32,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And he said no, in fact at that time he didn't believe that was a real disease.

92
0:04:30.44,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I said, "OK, if you're not, do you mind if I have it?"

93
0:04:34.88,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And he said, "Well, young man,

94
0:04:38.76,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I can't give you the brain.

95
0:04:40.28,000 --> 0:04:41,000
You need his family's permission.

96
0:04:41.92,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But if you do get the permission of his next of kin,

97
0:04:45.2,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I will release the brain to you."

98
0:04:47.68,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And I said, "Great!"

99
0:04:49.4,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And then I realized I had to figure out who his next of kin was and ask them,

100
0:04:53.08,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and it turned out it was Andre Waters's 88-year-old mother.

101
0:04:57.36,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And I sat there, and I took a breath and I thought,

102
0:05:00.12,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"Am I really going to cold-call an 88-year-old grieving mother

103
0:05:04.36,000 --> 0:05:05,000
who just lost her son to suicide?"

104
0:05:06.96,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And almost everything in me said, "Don't do it.

105
0:05:10.88,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It's too much to put this poor woman through,

106
0:05:13.28,000 --> 0:05:15,000
she's been through so much already."

107
0:05:15.44,000 --> 0:05:17,000
But then this other voice in my head said,

108
0:05:17.72,000 --> 0:05:18,000
"You know what?

109
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:21,000
If guys are killing themselves from this disease

110
0:05:21.84,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and we could study it to maybe prevent this from happening in the future,

111
0:05:25.8,000 --> 0:05:28,000
sometimes you've just got to suck it up and do something that's very hard."

112
0:05:29.4,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So I called her.

113
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:34,000
First time, nobody answered.

114
0:05:34.36,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Second time, no one answered, third... no voice mails.

115
0:05:37.32,000 --> 0:05:39,000
The fifth time, I got an answer.

116
0:05:39.76,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And thank God that Andre Waters's family was so gracious about the call and said,

117
0:05:46.32,000 --> 0:05:48,000
"You know what, we want to know what happened to Andre.

118
0:05:48.96,000 --> 0:05:51,000
We want to know why he changed so much in the last five years of his life."

119
0:05:52.52,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And so we studied the brain,

120
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and it turned out that he did have CTE.

121
0:05:59.2,000 --> 0:06:01,000
He became the third NFL player diagnosed with the disease.

122
0:06:02.04,000 --> 0:06:03,000
This is what it looks like.

123
0:06:03.64,000 --> 0:06:06,000
He was somewhere between mild and severe.

124
0:06:06.84,000 --> 0:06:09,000
OK, we have three of three NFL players here.

125
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Maybe this needs to get a little bit more serious.

126
0:06:12.72,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Maybe something's happening here.

127
0:06:14.36,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So I ended up starting the Concussion Legacy Foundation,

128
0:06:17.04,000 --> 0:06:18,000
actually formalized the work,

129
0:06:18.48,000 --> 0:06:2,000
so it wasn't just some guy calling for brains.

130
0:06:20.84,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And I searched the world.

131
0:06:23.6,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And I put together the best research team I could find.

132
0:06:26.56,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So we partnered with Boston University,

133
0:06:28.48,000 --> 0:06:31,000
we partnered with scientists at the VA here in Boston,

134
0:06:31.6,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and we started a brain bank.

135
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Turns out, if you want to know how to cure degenerative brain disease,

136
0:06:36.36,000 --> 0:06:38,000
you have to start by actually studying the brains.

137
0:06:38.76,000 --> 0:06:42,000
At this point, we were the first center in the world focused on CTE.

138
0:06:43.04,000 --> 0:06:45,000
It just had not been studied formally.

139
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And so we start this brain bank, and it's my job to get the brains

140
0:06:49.56,000 --> 0:06:52,000
for Dr. Ann McKee and her brain bank, right in the middle.

141
0:06:52.68,000 --> 0:06:55,000
We also work with Dr. Bob Stern, Dr. Robert Cantu,

142
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:58,000
truly my dream team of scientists that I support.

143
0:06:58.52,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So my job is to get the brains.

144
0:07:00.36,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And I was very successful in those early years.

145
0:07:03.88,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Since 2007 I've started every day by reading the obituaries.

146
0:07:08.84,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And it's a tough way to live.

147
0:07:10.68,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And it's hard on me

148
0:07:12.08,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and it's even worse on these poor families that I've been calling

149
0:07:16.12,000 --> 0:07:19,000
for the last 10 years, to ask for their brains.

150
0:07:19.2,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And so early on in the process, as it started to really eat away at me,

151
0:07:22.6,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I decided, you know what, can I find another way

152
0:07:25.6,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to get people to donate their brains to this research?

153
0:07:28.68,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And I figured out, what if we could create a culture

154
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
of brain donation in this country?

155
0:07:33.84,000 --> 0:07:36,000
What if it became normal for athletes to donate their brain after they died?

156
0:07:37.44,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And so what I started was a brain donation registry.

157
0:07:40.12,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And I started asking athletes

158
0:07:43.2,000 --> 0:07:46,000
if they would publicly pledge to donate their brain to science.

159
0:07:47.08,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And it started with, actually, a hockey player in 2009.

160
0:07:50.68,000 --> 0:07:54,000
One of my first pledges was a former Harvard hockey player,

161
0:07:55.12,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Noah Welch, who was in the NHL at the time.

162
0:07:57.8,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It was a slow start people understanding what this was about.

163
0:08:00.72,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So when the news hit the front page,

164
0:08:02.48,000 --> 0:08:04,000
"Noah Welch pledging his brain to science,"

165
0:08:04.52,000 --> 0:08:06,000
he said he went to the locker room the next day,

166
0:08:06.8,000 --> 0:08:08,000
one of his teammates pulled him aside and said,

167
0:08:09.04,000 --> 0:08:11,000
"Hey, I heard you're donating your brain to science."

168
0:08:11.56,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And he said, "Yep."

169
0:08:12.8,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And he said, "Wow. How many games are you going to miss?"

170
0:08:15.6,000 --> 0:08:16,000
(Laughter)

171
0:08:17.4,000 --> 0:08:18,000
True story.

172
0:08:18.64,000 --> 0:08:2,000
(Laughter)

173
0:08:24.8,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But we've been remarkably successful --

174
0:08:28.04,000 --> 0:08:31,000
over 2,500 athletes have signed up.

175
0:08:31.52,000 --> 0:08:34,000
They get a brain-donation card they keep in their wallet.

176
0:08:34.88,000 --> 0:08:37,000
This is mine, I was obviously first, it says 01.

177
0:08:39.36,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And I will donate my brain to this.

178
0:08:41.12,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We've also been lucky to have people like Brandi Chastain,

179
0:08:43.88,000 --> 0:08:44,000
the women's soccer icon,

180
0:08:45.159,000 --> 0:08:46,000
NASCAR's Dale Earnhardt Jr.

181
0:08:46.559,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Just two weeks ago, Hall-of-Famer Nick Buoniconti

182
0:08:48.96,000 --> 0:08:51,000
who had been diagnosed with dementia, signed up to pledge his brain.

183
0:08:52.2,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So it's been wonderful, and the great thing about it

184
0:08:54.679,000 --> 0:08:57,000
is that it has worked in changing how we're able to get brains.

185
0:08:58.44,000 --> 0:09:,000
So now, instead of me having to call, more families call us.

186
0:09:01.44,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And our phones ring off the hook.

187
0:09:03.48,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And so I can now focus on taking this information,

188
0:09:06.6,000 --> 0:09:08,000
figuring out how do we work towards a cure,

189
0:09:09.32,000 --> 0:09:1,000
how do we work towards prevention,

190
0:09:11.2,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and so my life has gotten a lot easier.

191
0:09:13.8,000 --> 0:09:16,000
This is just some of the headlines that we've able to get over the years

192
0:09:17.8,000 --> 0:09:18,000
from athletes pledging their brain.

193
0:09:20.08,000 --> 0:09:22,000
The problem has been what we learned.

194
0:09:22.24,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So when we started this,

195
0:09:23.48,000 --> 0:09:27,000
only 45 cases existed in the world of this disease

196
0:09:27.8,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that had been studied in brain banks.

197
0:09:30.04,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Since then, we have acquired 500 brains

198
0:09:33.32,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and found over 300 of them had CTE.

199
0:09:36.04,000 --> 0:09:37,000
To put that in perspective,

200
0:09:37.36,000 --> 0:09:4,000
the rest of the world has not studied 100 brains since we started this.

201
0:09:42.72,000 --> 0:09:44,000
What we've seen though is very frightening.

202
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So some of you might have seen the headline in July

203
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:49,000
in the "New York Times."

204
0:09:49.88,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And a recent study we published,

205
0:09:51.48,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that of the first 111 NFL players we looked at

206
0:09:54.64,000 --> 0:09:56,000
110 were positive for this disease.

207
0:09:57.76,000 --> 0:10:,000
Of the first 53 college football players we looked at,

208
0:10:01.24,000 --> 0:10:02,000
48 had this disease.

209
0:10:04.04,000 --> 0:10:07,000
That's something that's a very big concern to me.

210
0:10:07.68,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And so now, I'm very much focused

211
0:10:09.76,000 --> 0:10:12,000
on what can we do to actually treat this disease?

212
0:10:14.12,000 --> 0:10:17,000
We still can't diagnose CTE in living people,

213
0:10:17.68,000 --> 0:10:2,000
we have no treatments that are going to be coming

214
0:10:20.76,000 --> 0:10:22,000
out of the pharmaceutical industry in the next five years.

215
0:10:23.52,000 --> 0:10:25,000
This is a long, long fight.

216
0:10:25.6,000 --> 0:10:29,000
But our Concussion Legacy Foundation is here to not only facilitate this work,

217
0:10:30.32,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and that's the long game,

218
0:10:31.56,000 --> 0:10:33,000
but the short game is, hey, we can prevent this.

219
0:10:33.823,000 --> 0:10:34,000
We can prevent this disease

220
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
if we just stopped hitting people in the head so much.

221
0:10:37.76,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And frankly, we need to stop hitting children in the head.

222
0:10:40.64,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Turns out, it's not a great idea to hit a five-year-old in the head

223
0:10:43.84,000 --> 0:10:44,000
500 times each year.

224
0:10:45.08,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And it does actually open up the door to this disease.

225
0:10:47.84,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And so, we've got a lot of work ahead of us.

226
0:10:51.8,000 --> 0:10:54,000
But I have great hope that we're on our way to curing this disease.

227
0:10:56.28,000 --> 0:11:,000
But I hope you understand my story a little more now.

228
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And now that we've gotten to know each other a little bit better,

229
0:11:05.12,000 --> 0:11:07,000
this is the time where I ask you,

230
0:11:07.4,000 --> 0:11:08,000
"Can I have your brain?"

231
0:11:09.04,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Thank you very much.

232
0:11:10.44,000 --> 0:11:12,000
(Applause)

233
0:11:13.4,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Thank you.

234
0:11:14.64,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Applause)

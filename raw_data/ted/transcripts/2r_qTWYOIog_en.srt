1
0:00:12.739,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Has anyone among you ever been exposed to tear gas?

2
0:00:17.318,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Tear gas? Anyone?

3
0:00:20.433,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I'm sorry to hear that, so you might know that it's a very toxic substance,

4
0:00:25.004,000 --> 0:00:28,000
but you might not know that it's a very simple molecule

5
0:00:28.428,000 --> 0:00:3,000
with an unpronouncable name:

6
0:00:30.642,000 --> 0:00:33,000
it's called chlorobenzalmalononitrile.

7
0:00:35.779,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It's decades old, but it's becoming very trendy among police forces

8
0:00:41.137,000 --> 0:00:43,000
around the planet lately, it seems,

9
0:00:44.016,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and according to my experience as a non-voluntary breather of it,

10
0:00:48.753,000 --> 0:00:52,000
tear gas has two main but quite opposite effects.

11
0:00:53.026,000 --> 0:00:56,000
One, it can really burn your eyes,

12
0:00:56.168,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and two, it can also help you to open them.

13
0:01:00.603,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Tear gas definitely helped to open mine to something

14
0:01:04.192,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that I want to share with you this afternoon:

15
0:01:07.932,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that livestreaming the power of independent broadcasts through the web

16
0:01:13.226,000 --> 0:01:16,000
can be a game-changer in journalism,

17
0:01:16.407,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in activism, and as I see it, in the political discourse as well.

18
0:01:22.749,000 --> 0:01:26,000
That idea started to dawn on me in early 2011

19
0:01:27.522,000 --> 0:01:3,000
when I was covering a protest in São Paulo.

20
0:01:31.06,000 --> 0:01:32,000
It was the marijuana march,

21
0:01:33.048,000 --> 0:01:36,000
a gathering of people asking for the legalization of cannabis.

22
0:01:37.01,000 --> 0:01:39,000
When that group started to move,

23
0:01:39.475,000 --> 0:01:43,000
the riot police came from the back with rubber bullets, bombs,

24
0:01:43.785,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and then the gas.

25
0:01:46.184,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But to make a long story short,

26
0:01:48.202,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I had entered that protest as the editor-in-chief

27
0:01:52.091,000 --> 0:01:56,000
of a well-established printed magazine where I'd worked for 11 years,

28
0:01:56.864,000 --> 0:02:,000
and thanks to this unsolicited effects of tear gas,

29
0:02:01.776,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I left it as a journalist that was now committed to new ways

30
0:02:06.709,000 --> 0:02:11,000
of sharing the raw experience of what it's like to be there, actually.

31
0:02:12.652,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So in the following week, I was back in the streets,

32
0:02:16.492,000 --> 0:02:2,000
but that time, I wasn't a member of any media outlet anymore.

33
0:02:20.555,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I was there as an independent livestreamer, and all I had with me

34
0:02:25.176,000 --> 0:02:27,000
was basically borrowed equipment.

35
0:02:27.312,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I had a very simple camera and a backpack with 3G modems.

36
0:02:33.366,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And I had this weblink that could be shared through social media,

37
0:02:38.991,000 --> 0:02:4,000
could be put in any website,

38
0:02:41.868,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and that time, the protest went along fine.

39
0:02:44.897,000 --> 0:02:45,000
There was no violence.

40
0:02:46.746,000 --> 0:02:48,000
There was no action scenes.

41
0:02:48.835,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But there was something really exciting,

42
0:02:51.274,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because I could see at a distance the TV channels covering it,

43
0:02:56.124,000 --> 0:03:,000
and they had these big vans and the teams and the cameras,

44
0:03:00.148,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and I was basically doing the same thing

45
0:03:02.627,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and all I had was a backpack.

46
0:03:05.403,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And that was really exciting to a journalist,

47
0:03:08.678,000 --> 0:03:12,000
but the most interesting part was when I got back home, actually,

48
0:03:13.059,000 --> 0:03:15,000
because I learned that I had been watched

49
0:03:15.886,000 --> 0:03:18,000
by more than 90,000 people,

50
0:03:18.99,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and I got hundreds of emails and messages of people asking me, basically,

51
0:03:23.895,000 --> 0:03:24,000
how did I do it,

52
0:03:25.295,000 --> 0:03:28,000
how it was possible to do such a thing.

53
0:03:28.611,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And I learned something else, that that was actually the first time

54
0:03:31.884,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that somebody had ever done a livestreaming in a street protest

55
0:03:37.022,000 --> 0:03:38,000
in the country.

56
0:03:39.216,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And that really shocked me,

57
0:03:41.758,000 --> 0:03:44,000
because I was no geek, I was no technology guy,

58
0:03:45.536,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and all the equipment needed was already there,

59
0:03:48.295,000 --> 0:03:5,000
was easily available.

60
0:03:50.501,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And I realized that we had a frontier here,

61
0:03:53.617,000 --> 0:03:54,000
a very important one,

62
0:03:55.08,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that it was just a matter of changing the perspective,

63
0:03:58.237,000 --> 0:04:,000
and the web could be actually used,

64
0:04:00.466,000 --> 0:04:03,000
already used, as a colossal and uncontrollable

65
0:04:03.908,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and highly anarchical TV channel, TV network,

66
0:04:07.721,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and anyone with very basic skills and very basic equipment,

67
0:04:12.905,000 --> 0:04:17,000
even someone like me who had this little stuttering issue,

68
0:04:18.748,000 --> 0:04:22,000
so if it happens, bear with me please,

69
0:04:22.873,000 --> 0:04:26,000
even someone like me could become a broadcaster.

70
0:04:27.392,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And that sounded revolutionary in my mind.

71
0:04:29.584,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So for the next couple of years,

72
0:04:31.162,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I started to experiment with livestreaming in different ways,

73
0:04:35.209,000 --> 0:04:38,000
not only in the streets but mostly in studios and in homes,

74
0:04:38.815,000 --> 0:04:41,000
until the beginning of 2013, last year,

75
0:04:42.123,000 --> 0:04:46,000
when I became the cofounder of a group called Mídia NINJA.

76
0:04:46.303,000 --> 0:04:47,000
NINJA is an acronym

77
0:04:47.752,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that stands for Narrativas Independentes Jornalismo e Ação,

78
0:04:51.582,000 --> 0:04:54,000
or in English, independent narratives, journalism, and action.

79
0:04:55.493,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It was a media group that had little media plan.

80
0:04:59.415,000 --> 0:05:01,000
We didn't have any financial structure.

81
0:05:01.464,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We were not planning to make money out of this,

82
0:05:04.644,000 --> 0:05:08,000
which was wise, because you shouldn't try to make money out of journalism now.

83
0:05:10.484,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But we had a very solid and clear conviction,

84
0:05:13.188,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that we knew that the hyperconnected environment of social media

85
0:05:18.142,000 --> 0:05:2,000
could maybe allow us to consolidate

86
0:05:20.773,000 --> 0:05:25,000
a network of experimental journalists throughout the country.

87
0:05:26.117,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So we launched a Facebook page first, and then a manifesto,

88
0:05:31.254,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and started to cover the streets in a very simple way.

89
0:05:34.992,000 --> 0:05:38,000
But then something happened, something that wasn't predicted,

90
0:05:39.31,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that no one could have anticipated.

91
0:05:41.817,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Street protests started to erupt in São Paulo.

92
0:05:44.737,000 --> 0:05:46,000
They began as very local and specific.

93
0:05:46.917,000 --> 0:05:51,000
They were against the bus fare hike that had just happened in the city.

94
0:05:52.227,000 --> 0:05:53,000
This is a bus.

95
0:05:54.138,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It's written there, "Theft."

96
0:05:57.102,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But those kind of manifestations started to grow,

97
0:06:02.161,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and they kept happening.

98
0:06:03.996,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So the police violence against them started to grow as well.

99
0:06:08.803,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But there was another conflict,

100
0:06:10.512,000 --> 0:06:12,000
the one I believe that's more important here

101
0:06:13.016,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to make my point that it was a narrative conflict.

102
0:06:16.976,000 --> 0:06:19,000
There was this mainstream media version of the facts

103
0:06:20.006,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that anyone who was on the streets could easily challenge

104
0:06:24.292,000 --> 0:06:3,000
if they presented their own vision of what was actually happening there.

105
0:06:30.561,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And it was this clash of visions, this clash of narratives,

106
0:06:33.641,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that I think turned those protests

107
0:06:36.983,000 --> 0:06:39,000
into a long period in the country of political reckoning

108
0:06:40.824,000 --> 0:06:43,000
where hundreds of thousands of people,

109
0:06:44.332,000 --> 0:06:45,000
probably more than a million people

110
0:06:46.15,000 --> 0:06:48,000
took to the streets in the whole country.

111
0:06:49.638,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But it wasn't about the bus fare hike anymore.

112
0:06:52.252,000 --> 0:06:55,000
It was about everything.

113
0:06:55.796,000 --> 0:06:57,000
The people's demands, their expectations,

114
0:06:58.246,000 --> 0:07:,000
the reasons why they were on the streets

115
0:07:00.396,000 --> 0:07:04,000
could be as diverse as they could be contradictory in many cases.

116
0:07:05.235,000 --> 0:07:09,000
If you could read it, you would understand me.

117
0:07:09.343,000 --> 0:07:13,000
But it was in this environment of political catharsis

118
0:07:13.738,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that the country was going through

119
0:07:16.687,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that it had to do with politics, indeed,

120
0:07:19.984,000 --> 0:07:23,000
but it had to do also with a new way of organizing,

121
0:07:24.017,000 --> 0:07:26,000
through a new way of communicating.

122
0:07:26.95,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It was in that environment that Mídia NINJA emerged

123
0:07:29.752,000 --> 0:07:33,000
from almost anonymity to become a national phenomenon,

124
0:07:34.435,000 --> 0:07:36,000
because we did have the right equipment.

125
0:07:37.288,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We are not using big cameras.

126
0:07:39.488,000 --> 0:07:41,000
We are using basically this.

127
0:07:42.112,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We are using smartphones.

128
0:07:44.111,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And that, actually, allowed us to become invisible in the middle of the protests,

129
0:07:49.019,000 --> 0:07:51,000
but it allowed us to do something else:

130
0:07:51.701,000 --> 0:07:54,000
to show what it was like to be in the protests,

131
0:07:55.525,000 --> 0:08:,000
to present to people at home a subjective perspective.

132
0:08:01.279,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But there was something that is more important,

133
0:08:03.615,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I think, than the equipment.

134
0:08:04.971,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It was our mindset,

135
0:08:07.699,000 --> 0:08:1,000
because we are not behaving as a media outlet.

136
0:08:10.87,000 --> 0:08:11,000
We are not competing for news.

137
0:08:12.808,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We are trying to encourage people,

138
0:08:15.129,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to invite people, and to actually teach people

139
0:08:17.985,000 --> 0:08:21,000
how to do this, how they also could become broadcasters.

140
0:08:22.195,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And that was crucial to turn Mídia NINJA from a small group of people,

141
0:08:28.265,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and in a matter of weeks,

142
0:08:29.915,000 --> 0:08:33,000
we multiplied and we grew exponentially throughout the country.

143
0:08:34.492,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So in a matter of a week or two, as the protests kept happening,

144
0:08:39.169,000 --> 0:08:41,000
we were hundreds of young people

145
0:08:41.381,000 --> 0:08:43,000
connected in this network throughout the country.

146
0:08:44.186,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We were covering more than 50 cities at the same time.

147
0:08:47.326,000 --> 0:08:5,000
That's something that no TV channel could ever do.

148
0:08:50.98,000 --> 0:08:53,000
That was responsible for turning us suddenly, actually,

149
0:08:54.393,000 --> 0:08:58,000
into kind of the mainstream media of social media.

150
0:08:59.319,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So we had a couple of thousands of followers on our Facebook page,

151
0:09:03.37,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and soon we had a quarter of a million followers.

152
0:09:06.606,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Our posts and our videos

153
0:09:08.29,000 --> 0:09:11,000
were being seen by more than 11 million timelines a week.

154
0:09:12.269,000 --> 0:09:17,000
It was way more than any newspaper or any magazine could ever do.

155
0:09:17.99,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And that turned Mídia NINJA into something else,

156
0:09:21.234,000 --> 0:09:24,000
more than a media outlet, than a media project.

157
0:09:24.675,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It became almost like a public service

158
0:09:27.434,000 --> 0:09:29,000
to the citizen, to the protester,

159
0:09:29.961,000 --> 0:09:3,000
to the activist,

160
0:09:31.695,000 --> 0:09:34,000
because they had a very simple and efficient and peaceful tool

161
0:09:35.123,000 --> 0:09:39,000
to confront both police and media authority.

162
0:09:41.644,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Many of our images started to be used in regular TV channels.

163
0:09:45.643,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Our livestreams started to be broadcast even in regular televisions

164
0:09:50.474,000 --> 0:09:51,000
when things got really rough.

165
0:09:52.433,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Some our images were responsible to take some people out of jail,

166
0:09:57.73,000 --> 0:09:59,000
people who were being arrested unfairly

167
0:10:00.569,000 --> 0:10:03,000
under false accusations, and we could prove them innocent.

168
0:10:04.338,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And that also turned Mídia NINJA very soon

169
0:10:07.579,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to be seen as almost an enemy of cops, unfortunately,

170
0:10:11.59,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and we started to be severely beaten, and eventually arrested on the streets.

171
0:10:16.663,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It happened in many cases.

172
0:10:18.577,000 --> 0:10:22,000
But that was also useful, because we were still at the web,

173
0:10:22.909,000 --> 0:10:27,000
so that helped to trigger an important debate in the country

174
0:10:28.094,000 --> 0:10:3,000
on the role of the media itself

175
0:10:30.543,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and the state of the freedom of the press in the country.

176
0:10:34.142,000 --> 0:10:35,000
So Mídia NINJA now evolved

177
0:10:36.093,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and finally consolidated itself in what we hoped it would become:

178
0:10:42.143,000 --> 0:10:45,000
a national network of hundreds of young people,

179
0:10:45.427,000 --> 0:10:48,000
self-organizing themselves locally

180
0:10:49.304,000 --> 0:10:52,000
to cover social, human rights issues,

181
0:10:53.065,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and expressing themselves not only politically

182
0:10:55.833,000 --> 0:10:57,000
but journalistically.

183
0:11:00.665,000 --> 0:11:04,000
What I started to do in the beginning of this year,

184
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:09,000
as Mídia NINJA is already a self-organizing network,

185
0:11:09.156,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I'm dedicating myself to another project.

186
0:11:12.589,000 --> 0:11:15,000
It's called Fluxo, which is Portuguese for "stream."

187
0:11:15.835,000 --> 0:11:17,000
It's a journalism studio in São Paulo downtown,

188
0:11:18.642,000 --> 0:11:21,000
where I used livestream to experiment

189
0:11:21.969,000 --> 0:11:24,000
with what I call post-television formats.

190
0:11:25.474,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But I'm also trying to come up with ways to finance independent journalism

191
0:11:30.852,000 --> 0:11:32,000
through a direct relationship with an audience,

192
0:11:33.664,000 --> 0:11:34,000
with an active audience,

193
0:11:35.626,000 --> 0:11:37,000
because now I really want to try to make a living

194
0:11:38.296,000 --> 0:11:41,000
out of my tear gas resolution back then.

195
0:11:42.058,000 --> 0:11:44,000
But there's something more significant here,

196
0:11:44.348,000 --> 0:11:49,000
something that I believe is more important and more crucial than my personal example.

197
0:11:49.794,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I said that livestream could turn the web into a colossal TV network,

198
0:11:54.629,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but I believe it does something else,

199
0:11:56.666,000 --> 0:11:58,000
because after watching people using it,

200
0:11:59.627,000 --> 0:12:05,000
not only to cover things but to express, to organize themselves politically,

201
0:12:05.651,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I believe livestream can turn cyberspace into a global political arena

202
0:12:12.419,000 --> 0:12:14,000
where everyone might have a voice,

203
0:12:14.803,000 --> 0:12:15,000
a proper voice,

204
0:12:16.347,000 --> 0:12:21,000
because livestream takes the monopoly of the broadcast political discourse,

205
0:12:21.832,000 --> 0:12:23,000
of the verbal aspect of the political dialogue

206
0:12:24.585,000 --> 0:12:29,000
out of the mouths of just politicians and political pundits alone,

207
0:12:30.194,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and it empowers the citizen through this direct and non-mediated power

208
0:12:35.664,000 --> 0:12:37,000
of exchanging experiences and dialogue,

209
0:12:38.647,000 --> 0:12:42,000
empowers them to question and to influence authorities

210
0:12:42.697,000 --> 0:12:45,000
in ways in which we are about to see.

211
0:12:46.226,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And I believe it does something else that might be even more important,

212
0:12:50.78,000 --> 0:12:56,000
that the simplicity of the technology can merge objectivity and subjectivity

213
0:12:57.47,000 --> 0:12:59,000
in a very political way, as I see it,

214
0:13:00.133,000 --> 0:13:05,000
because it really helps the audience,

215
0:13:05.302,000 --> 0:13:09,000
the citizen, to see the world through somebody else's eye,

216
0:13:09.796,000 --> 0:13:12,000
so it helps the citizen to put him- or herself

217
0:13:13.23,000 --> 0:13:15,000
in other people's place.

218
0:13:15.902,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And that idea, I think, should be the intention,

219
0:13:19.17,000 --> 0:13:23,000
should be the goal of any good journalism, any good activism,

220
0:13:23.885,000 --> 0:13:25,000
but most of all, any good politics.

221
0:13:26.537,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Thank you very much. It was an honor.

222
0:13:29.065,000 --> 0:13:34,000
(Applause)

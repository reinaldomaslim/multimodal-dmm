1
0:00:13.134,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So let me with start with Roy Amara.

2
0:00:16.35,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Roy's argument is that most new technologies tend to be overestimated

3
0:00:20.585,000 --> 0:00:22,000
in their impact to begin with,

4
0:00:22.677,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and then they get underestimated in the long term

5
0:00:25.103,000 --> 0:00:26,000
because we get used to them.

6
0:00:26.491,000 --> 0:00:28,000
These really are days of miracle and wonder.

7
0:00:29.433,000 --> 0:00:31,000
You remember that wonderful song by Paul Simon?

8
0:00:32.365,000 --> 0:00:33,000
There were two lines in it.

9
0:00:33.727,000 --> 0:00:36,000
So what was it that was considered miraculous back then?

10
0:00:38.393,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Slowing down things -- slow motion --

11
0:00:41.371,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and the long-distance call.

12
0:00:43.941,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Because, of course, you used to get interrupted by operators

13
0:00:46.824,000 --> 0:00:48,000
who'd tell you, "Long distance calling. Do you want to hang up?"

14
0:00:49.845,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And now we think nothing of calling all over the world.

15
0:00:53.04,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Well, something similar may be happening

16
0:00:55.694,000 --> 0:00:57,000
with reading and programming life.

17
0:00:58.636,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But before I unpack that,

18
0:01:01.069,000 --> 0:01:03,000
let's just talk about telescopes.

19
0:01:04.798,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Telescopes were overestimated originally in their impact.

20
0:01:09.133,000 --> 0:01:11,000
This is one of Galileo's early models.

21
0:01:12.09,000 --> 0:01:15,000
People thought it was just going to ruin all religion.

22
0:01:15.473,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:18.862,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So we're not paying that much attention to telescopes.

24
0:01:22.628,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But, of course, telescopes launched 10 years ago, as you just heard,

25
0:01:26.734,000 --> 0:01:28,000
could take this Volkswagen, fly it to the moon,

26
0:01:29.749,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and you could see the lights on that Volkswagen light up on the moon.

27
0:01:36.624,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And that's the kind of resolution power that allowed you to see

28
0:01:40.592,000 --> 0:01:43,000
little specks of dust floating around distant suns.

29
0:01:44.22,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Imagine for a second that this was a sun a billion light years away,

30
0:01:48.31,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and you had a little speck of dust that came in front of it.

31
0:01:51.566,000 --> 0:01:53,000
That's what detecting an exoplanet is like.

32
0:01:55.268,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And the cool thing is, the telescopes that are now being launched

33
0:02:00.138,000 --> 0:02:03,000
would allow you to see a single candle lit on the moon.

34
0:02:04.279,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And if you separated it by one plate,

35
0:02:07.131,000 --> 0:02:09,000
you could see two candles separately at that distance.

36
0:02:11.124,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And that's the kind of resolution that you need

37
0:02:13.961,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to begin to image that little speck of dust

38
0:02:16.453,000 --> 0:02:17,000
as it comes around the sun

39
0:02:17.763,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and see if it has a blue-green signature.

40
0:02:21.12,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And if it does have a blue-green signature,

41
0:02:23.215,000 --> 0:02:25,000
it means that life is common in the universe.

42
0:02:25.459,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The first time you ever see a blue-green signature on a distant planet,

43
0:02:29.679,000 --> 0:02:3,000
it means there's photosynthesis there,

44
0:02:31.696,000 --> 0:02:32,000
there's water there,

45
0:02:33.001,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and the chances that you saw the only other planet with photosynthesis

46
0:02:36.897,000 --> 0:02:37,000
are about zero.

47
0:02:39.108,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And that's a calendar-changing event.

48
0:02:41.67,000 --> 0:02:43,000
There's a before and after we were alone in the universe:

49
0:02:44.446,000 --> 0:02:46,000
forget about the discovery of whatever continent.

50
0:02:48.751,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So as you're thinking about this,

51
0:02:50.355,000 --> 0:02:52,000
we're now beginning to be able to image most of the universe.

52
0:02:53.281,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And that is a time of miracle and wonder.

53
0:02:55.559,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And we kind of take that for granted.

54
0:02:59.562,000 --> 0:03:,000
Something similar is happening in life.

55
0:03:01.501,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So we're hearing about life in these little bits and pieces.

56
0:03:04.563,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We hear about CRISPR, and we hear about this technology,

57
0:03:07.245,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and we hear about this technology.

58
0:03:08.935,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But the bottom line on life is that life turns out to be code.

59
0:03:13.9,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And life as code is a really important concept because it means,

60
0:03:17.874,000 --> 0:03:2,000
just in the same way as you can write a sentence

61
0:03:21.108,000 --> 0:03:24,000
in English or in French or Chinese,

62
0:03:25.146,000 --> 0:03:27,000
just in the same way as you can copy a sentence,

63
0:03:28.076,000 --> 0:03:3,000
just in the same way as you can edit a sentence,

64
0:03:30.626,000 --> 0:03:32,000
just in the same way as you can print a sentence,

65
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
you're beginning to be able to do that with life.

66
0:03:37.237,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It means that we're beginning to learn how to read this language.

67
0:03:40.772,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And this, of course, is the language that is used by this orange.

68
0:03:44.702,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So how does this orange execute code?

69
0:03:46.522,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It doesn't do it in ones and zeroes like a computer does.

70
0:03:49.254,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It sits on a tree, and one day it does:

71
0:03:51.163,000 --> 0:03:52,000
plop!

72
0:03:52.819,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And that means: execute.

73
0:03:55.149,000 --> 0:03:58,000
AATCAAG: make me a little root.

74
0:03:59.057,000 --> 0:04:01,000
TCGACC: make me a little stem.

75
0:04:01.583,000 --> 0:04:04,000
GAC: make me some leaves. AGC: make me some flowers.

76
0:04:05.045,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And then GCAA: make me some more oranges.

77
0:04:08.984,000 --> 0:04:12,000
If I edit a sentence in English on a word processor,

78
0:04:15.153,000 --> 0:04:18,000
then what happens is you can go from this word to that word.

79
0:04:20.134,000 --> 0:04:22,000
If I edit something in this orange

80
0:04:22.294,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and put in GCAAC, using CRISPR or something else that you've heard of,

81
0:04:28.261,000 --> 0:04:29,000
then this orange becomes a lemon,

82
0:04:30.957,000 --> 0:04:31,000
or it becomes a grapefruit,

83
0:04:32.529,000 --> 0:04:33,000
or it becomes a tangerine.

84
0:04:35.102,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And if I edit one in a thousand letters,

85
0:04:37.144,000 --> 0:04:39,000
you become the person sitting next to you today.

86
0:04:40.757,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Be more careful where you sit.

87
0:04:42.301,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:45.014,000 --> 0:04:48,000
What's happening on this stuff is it was really expensive to begin with.

89
0:04:48.513,000 --> 0:04:49,000
It was like long-distance calls.

90
0:04:51.399,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But the cost of this is dropping 50 percent faster than Moore's law.

91
0:04:55.909,000 --> 0:04:58,000
The first $200 full genome was announced yesterday by Veritas.

92
0:05:00.494,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And so as you're looking at these systems,

93
0:05:02.648,000 --> 0:05:05,000
it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, and then it does.

94
0:05:06.474,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So let me just give you the map view of this stuff.

95
0:05:10.973,000 --> 0:05:12,000
This is a big discovery.

96
0:05:13.556,000 --> 0:05:14,000
There's 23 chromosomes.

97
0:05:15.503,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Cool.

98
0:05:17.287,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Let's now start using a telescope version, but instead of using a telescope,

99
0:05:20.99,000 --> 0:05:22,000
let's use a microscope to zoom in

100
0:05:23.334,000 --> 0:05:25,000
on the inferior of those chromosomes,

101
0:05:25.43,000 --> 0:05:26,000
which is the Y chromosome.

102
0:05:28.432,000 --> 0:05:31,000
It's a third the size of the X. It's recessive and mutant.

103
0:05:32.443,000 --> 0:05:33,000
But hey,

104
0:05:34.262,000 --> 0:05:35,000
just a male.

105
0:05:36.914,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And as you're looking at this stuff,

106
0:05:39.218,000 --> 0:05:42,000
here's kind of a country view

107
0:05:42.692,000 --> 0:05:44,000
at a 400 base pair resolution level,

108
0:05:44.92,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and then you zoom in to 550, and then you zoom in to 850,

109
0:05:48.363,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and you can begin to identify more and more genes as you zoom in.

110
0:05:52.249,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Then you zoom in to the state level,

111
0:05:55.473,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and you can begin to tell who's got leukemia,

112
0:05:59.543,000 --> 0:06:02,000
how did they get leukemia, what kind of leukemia do they have,

113
0:06:02.591,000 --> 0:06:04,000
what shifted from what place to what place.

114
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And then you zoom in to the Google street view level.

115
0:06:09.387,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So this is what happens if you have colorectal cancer

116
0:06:12.084,000 --> 0:06:16,000
for a very specific patient on the letter-by-letter resolution.

117
0:06:18.148,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So what we're doing in this stuff is we're gathering information

118
0:06:21.282,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and just generating enormous amounts of information.

119
0:06:23.822,000 --> 0:06:25,000
This is one of the largest databases on the planet

120
0:06:26.72,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and it's growing faster than we can build computers to store it.

121
0:06:32.063,000 --> 0:06:34,000
You can create some incredible maps with this stuff.

122
0:06:35.292,000 --> 0:06:37,000
You want to understand the plague and why one plague is bubonic

123
0:06:38.287,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and the other one is a different kind of plague

124
0:06:40.535,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and the other one is a different kind of plague?

125
0:06:42.869,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Well, here's a map of the plague.

126
0:06:45.037,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Some are absolutely deadly to humans,

127
0:06:46.881,000 --> 0:06:47,000
some are not.

128
0:06:48.486,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And note, by the way, as you go to the bottom of this,

129
0:06:51.106,000 --> 0:06:52,000
how does it compare to tuberculosis?

130
0:06:53.708,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So this is the difference between tuberculosis and various kinds of plagues,

131
0:06:57.361,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and you can play detective with this stuff,

132
0:06:59.72,000 --> 0:07:01,000
because you can take a very specific kind of cholera

133
0:07:02.219,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that affected Haiti,

134
0:07:04.377,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and you can look at which country it came from,

135
0:07:07.087,000 --> 0:07:08,000
which region it came from,

136
0:07:09.496,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and probably which soldier took that from that African country to Haiti.

137
0:07:17.133,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Zoom out.

138
0:07:18.669,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It's not just zooming in.

139
0:07:21.042,000 --> 0:07:23,000
This is one of the coolest maps ever done by human beings.

140
0:07:24.446,000 --> 0:07:27,000
What they've done is taken all the genetic information they have

141
0:07:27.526,000 --> 0:07:28,000
about all the species,

142
0:07:29.031,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and they've put a tree of life on a single page

143
0:07:32.485,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that you can zoom in and out of.

144
0:07:34.484,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So this is what came first, how did it diversify, how did it branch,

145
0:07:38.229,000 --> 0:07:39,000
how large is that genome,

146
0:07:39.483,000 --> 0:07:4,000
on a single page.

147
0:07:41.619,000 --> 0:07:43,000
It's kind of the universe of life on Earth,

148
0:07:43.706,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and it's being constantly updated and completed.

149
0:07:46.982,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And so as you're looking at this stuff,

150
0:07:48.865,000 --> 0:07:51,000
the really important change is the old biology used to be reactive.

151
0:07:52.24,000 --> 0:07:54,000
You used to have a lot of biologists that had microscopes,

152
0:07:54.984,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and they had magnifying glasses and they were out observing animals.

153
0:07:58.897,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The new biology is proactive.

154
0:08:01.433,000 --> 0:08:04,000
You don't just observe stuff, you make stuff.

155
0:08:05.135,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And that's a really big change

156
0:08:06.807,000 --> 0:08:08,000
because it allows us to do things like this.

157
0:08:10.559,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And I know you're really excited by this picture.

158
0:08:13.05,000 --> 0:08:14,000
(Laughter)

159
0:08:14.185,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It only took us four years and 40 million dollars

160
0:08:16.583,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to be able to take this picture.

161
0:08:18.209,000 --> 0:08:19,000
(Laughter)

162
0:08:19.463,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And what we did

163
0:08:21.586,000 --> 0:08:24,000
is we took the full gene code out of a cell --

164
0:08:24.885,000 --> 0:08:27,000
not a gene, not two genes, the full gene code out of a cell --

165
0:08:30.016,000 --> 0:08:31,000
built a completely new gene code,

166
0:08:32.825,000 --> 0:08:33,000
inserted it into the cell,

167
0:08:34.424,000 --> 0:08:36,000
figured out a way to have the cell execute that code

168
0:08:37.38,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and built a completely new species.

169
0:08:40.884,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So this is the world's first synthetic life form.

170
0:08:45.81,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And so what do you do with this stuff?

171
0:08:48.43,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Well, this stuff is going to change the world.

172
0:08:51.417,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Let me give you three short-term trends

173
0:08:53.38,000 --> 0:08:55,000
in terms of how it's going to change the world.

174
0:08:56.269,000 --> 0:08:58,000
The first is we're going to see a new industrial revolution.

175
0:08:59.674,000 --> 0:09:,000
And I actually mean that literally.

176
0:09:01.992,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So in the same way as Switzerland and Germany and Britain

177
0:09:06.507,000 --> 0:09:09,000
changed the world with machines like the one you see in this lobby,

178
0:09:11.537,000 --> 0:09:12,000
created power --

179
0:09:13.273,000 --> 0:09:15,000
in the same way CERN is changing the world,

180
0:09:15.961,000 --> 0:09:18,000
using new instruments and our concept of the universe --

181
0:09:20.06,000 --> 0:09:22,000
programmable life forms are also going to change the world

182
0:09:23.81,000 --> 0:09:24,000
because once you can program cells

183
0:09:25.489,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in the same way as you program your computer chip,

184
0:09:29.736,000 --> 0:09:3,000
then you can make almost anything.

185
0:09:32.369,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So your computer chip can produce photographs,

186
0:09:35.172,000 --> 0:09:37,000
can produce music, can produce film,

187
0:09:37.269,000 --> 0:09:39,000
can produce love letters, can produce spreadsheets.

188
0:09:39.706,000 --> 0:09:41,000
It's just ones and zeroes flying through there.

189
0:09:42.604,000 --> 0:09:44,000
If you can flow ATCGs through cells,

190
0:09:46.123,000 --> 0:09:49,000
then this software makes its own hardware,

191
0:09:49.201,000 --> 0:09:51,000
which means it scales very quickly.

192
0:09:52.487,000 --> 0:09:53,000
No matter what happens,

193
0:09:54.162,000 --> 0:09:56,000
if you leave your cell phone by your bedside,

194
0:09:56.344,000 --> 0:09:58,000
you will not have a billion cell phones in the morning.

195
0:09:59.489,000 --> 0:10:03,000
But if you do that with living organisms,

196
0:10:05.222,000 --> 0:10:07,000
you can make this stuff at a very large scale.

197
0:10:09.39,000 --> 0:10:11,000
One of the things you can do is you can start producing

198
0:10:12.31,000 --> 0:10:14,000
close to carbon-neutral fuels

199
0:10:14.557,000 --> 0:10:16,000
on a commercial scale by 2025,

200
0:10:18.054,000 --> 0:10:19,000
which we're doing with Exxon.

201
0:10:20.87,000 --> 0:10:22,000
But you can also substitute for agricultural lands.

202
0:10:23.303,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Instead of having 100 hectares to make oils or to make proteins,

203
0:10:28.078,000 --> 0:10:29,000
you can make it in these vats

204
0:10:29.961,000 --> 0:10:31,000
at 10 or 100 times the productivity per hectare.

205
0:10:33.488,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Or you can store information, or you can make all the world's vaccines

206
0:10:36.894,000 --> 0:10:37,000
in those three vats.

207
0:10:39.276,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Or you can store most of the information that's held at CERN in those three vats.

208
0:10:44.35,000 --> 0:10:47,000
DNA is a really powerful information storage device.

209
0:10:48.806,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Second turn:

210
0:10:50.418,000 --> 0:10:52,000
you're beginning to see the rise of theoretical biology.

211
0:10:54.256,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So, medical school departments are one of the most conservative places on earth.

212
0:10:58.482,000 --> 0:11:01,000
The way they teach anatomy is similar to the way they taught anatomy

213
0:11:01.923,000 --> 0:11:02,000
100 years ago.

214
0:11:03.113,000 --> 0:11:05,000
"Welcome, student. Here's your cadaver."

215
0:11:06.149,000 --> 0:11:09,000
One of the things medical schools are not good at is creating new departments,

216
0:11:09.88,000 --> 0:11:1,000
which is why this is so unusual.

217
0:11:12.351,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Isaac Kohane has now created a department based on informatics, data, knowledge

218
0:11:18.873,000 --> 0:11:19,000
at Harvard Medical School.

219
0:11:21.408,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And in a sense, what's beginning to happen is

220
0:11:23.609,000 --> 0:11:25,000
biology is beginning to get enough data

221
0:11:26.115,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that it can begin to follow the steps of physics,

222
0:11:28.905,000 --> 0:11:31,000
which used to be observational physics

223
0:11:32.317,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and experimental physicists,

224
0:11:34.312,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and then started creating theoretical biology.

225
0:11:36.498,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Well, that's what you're beginning to see

226
0:11:38.526,000 --> 0:11:39,000
because you have so many medical records,

227
0:11:40.53,000 --> 0:11:42,000
because you have so much data about people:

228
0:11:42.586,000 --> 0:11:44,000
you've got their genomes, you've got their viromes,

229
0:11:45.02,000 --> 0:11:46,000
you've got their microbiomes.

230
0:11:46.538,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And as this information stacks,

231
0:11:48.543,000 --> 0:11:5,000
you can begin to make predictions.

232
0:11:52.149,000 --> 0:11:55,000
The third thing that's happening is this is coming to the consumer.

233
0:11:56.629,000 --> 0:12:,000
So you, too, can get your genes sequenced.

234
0:12:01.698,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And this is beginning to create companies like 23andMe,

235
0:12:04.45,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and companies like 23andMe are going to be giving you

236
0:12:06.952,000 --> 0:12:07,000
more and more and more data,

237
0:12:08.328,000 --> 0:12:09,000
not just about your relatives,

238
0:12:10.562,000 --> 0:12:11,000
but about you and your body,

239
0:12:11.946,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and it's going to compare stuff,

240
0:12:13.501,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and it's going to compare stuff across time,

241
0:12:15.618,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and these are going to become very large databases.

242
0:12:18.249,000 --> 0:12:2,000
But it's also beginning to affect a series of other businesses

243
0:12:21.235,000 --> 0:12:22,000
in unexpected ways.

244
0:12:23.802,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Normally, when you advertise something, you really don't want the consumer

245
0:12:27.577,000 --> 0:12:31,000
to take your advertisement into the bathroom to pee on.

246
0:12:33.993,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Unless, of course, if you're IKEA.

247
0:12:37.381,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Because when you rip this out of a magazine and you pee on it,

248
0:12:40.311,000 --> 0:12:42,000
it'll turn blue if you're pregnant.

249
0:12:42.404,000 --> 0:12:43,000
(Laughter)

250
0:12:44.214,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And they'll give you a discount on your crib.

251
0:12:48.111,000 --> 0:12:49,000
(Laughter)

252
0:12:49.293,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Right? So when I say consumer empowerment,

253
0:12:51.332,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and this is spreading beyond biotech,

254
0:12:54.095,000 --> 0:12:55,000
I actually really mean that.

255
0:12:58.273,000 --> 0:13:01,000
We're now beginning to produce, at Synthetic Genomics,

256
0:13:02.54,000 --> 0:13:03,000
desktop printers

257
0:13:05.228,000 --> 0:13:08,000
that allow you to design a cell,

258
0:13:08.782,000 --> 0:13:09,000
print a cell,

259
0:13:09.973,000 --> 0:13:1,000
execute the program on the cell.

260
0:13:12.825,000 --> 0:13:14,000
We can now print vaccines

261
0:13:14.952,000 --> 0:13:16,000
real time as an airplane takes off

262
0:13:17.223,000 --> 0:13:18,000
before it lands.

263
0:13:19.929,000 --> 0:13:21,000
We're shipping 78 of these machines this year.

264
0:13:24.068,000 --> 0:13:28,000
This is not theoretical biology. This is printing biology.

265
0:13:30.182,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Let me talk about two long-term trends

266
0:13:33.374,000 --> 0:13:36,000
that are coming at you over a longer time period.

267
0:13:37.658,000 --> 0:13:39,000
The first one is, we're starting to redesign species.

268
0:13:41.055,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And you've heard about that, right?

269
0:13:42.856,000 --> 0:13:44,000
We're redesigning trees. We're redesigning flowers.

270
0:13:45.561,000 --> 0:13:47,000
We're redesigning yogurt,

271
0:13:48.513,000 --> 0:13:5,000
cheese, whatever else you want.

272
0:13:51.678,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And that, of course, brings up the interesting question:

273
0:13:54.884,000 --> 0:13:56,000
How and when should we redesign humans?

274
0:13:59.566,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And a lot of us think, "Oh no, we never want to redesign humans."

275
0:14:04.147,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Unless, of course, if your child has a Huntington's gene

276
0:14:06.886,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and is condemned to death.

277
0:14:09.172,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Or, unless if you're passing on a cystic fibrosis gene,

278
0:14:12.559,000 --> 0:14:14,000
in which case, you don't just want to redesign yourself,

279
0:14:15.273,000 --> 0:14:17,000
you want to redesign your children and their children.

280
0:14:18.723,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And these are complicated debates and they're going to happen in real time.

281
0:14:22.839,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I'll give you one current example.

282
0:14:25.531,000 --> 0:14:28,000
One of the debates going on at the National Academies today

283
0:14:29.896,000 --> 0:14:33,000
is you have the power to put a gene drive into mosquitoes

284
0:14:34.622,000 --> 0:14:36,000
so that you will kill all the malaria-carrying mosquitoes.

285
0:14:39.547,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Now, some people say,

286
0:14:42.964,000 --> 0:14:45,000
"That's going to affect the environment in an extreme way, don't do it."

287
0:14:47.326,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Other people say,

288
0:14:48.505,000 --> 0:14:51,000
"This is one of the things that's killing millions of people yearly.

289
0:14:51.756,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Who are you to tell me that I can't save the kids in my country?"

290
0:14:57.183,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And why is this debate so complicated?

291
0:14:59.06,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Because as soon as you let this loose in Brazil

292
0:15:01.965,000 --> 0:15:02,000
or in Southern Florida --

293
0:15:03.412,000 --> 0:15:04,000
mosquitoes don't respect walls.

294
0:15:04.977,000 --> 0:15:06,000
You're making a decision for the world

295
0:15:07.302,000 --> 0:15:08,000
when you put a gene drive into the air.

296
0:15:14.145,000 --> 0:15:16,000
This wonderful man won a Nobel Prize,

297
0:15:17.103,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and after winning the Nobel Prize

298
0:15:18.767,000 --> 0:15:19,000
he's been worrying about

299
0:15:21.531,000 --> 0:15:23,000
how did life get started on this planet

300
0:15:23.658,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and how likely is it that it's in other places?

301
0:15:27.097,000 --> 0:15:3,000
So what he's been doing is going around to this graduate students

302
0:15:30.323,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and saying to his graduate students,

303
0:15:32.864,000 --> 0:15:35,000
"Build me life but don't use any modern chemicals or instruments.

304
0:15:36.21,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Build me stuff that was here three billion years ago.

305
0:15:38.899,000 --> 0:15:41,000
You can't use lasers. You can't use this. You can't use that."

306
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000
He gave me a vial of what he's built about three weeks ago.

307
0:15:48.639,000 --> 0:15:49,000
What has he built?

308
0:15:49.842,000 --> 0:15:53,000
He's built basically what looked like soap bubbles that are made out of lipids.

309
0:15:53.891,000 --> 0:15:55,000
He's built a precursor of RNA.

310
0:15:57.291,000 --> 0:16:,000
He's had the precursor of the RNA be absorbed by the cell

311
0:16:02.194,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and then he's had the cells divide.

312
0:16:06.031,000 --> 0:16:07,000
We may not be that far --

313
0:16:09.687,000 --> 0:16:12,000
call it a decade, maybe two decades --

314
0:16:12.828,000 --> 0:16:13,000
from generating life from scratch

315
0:16:16.285,000 --> 0:16:17,000
out of proto-communities.

316
0:16:19.512,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Second long-term trend:

317
0:16:22.273,000 --> 0:16:25,000
we've been living and are living through the digital age --

318
0:16:25.823,000 --> 0:16:27,000
we're starting to live through the age of the genome

319
0:16:28.366,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and biology and CRISPR and synthetic biology --

320
0:16:32.87,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and all of that is going to merge into the age of the brain.

321
0:16:36.743,000 --> 0:16:39,000
So we're getting to the point where we can rebuild most of our body parts,

322
0:16:40.748,000 --> 0:16:43,000
in the same way as if you break a bone or burn your skin, it regrows.

323
0:16:44.428,000 --> 0:16:46,000
We're beginning to learn how to regrow our tracheas

324
0:16:47.12,000 --> 0:16:48,000
or how to regrow our bladders.

325
0:16:49.008,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Both of those have been implanted in humans.

326
0:16:51.338,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Tony Atala is working on 32 different organs.

327
0:16:55.487,000 --> 0:16:56,000
But the core is going to be this,

328
0:16:57.401,000 --> 0:17:,000
because this is you and the rest is just packaging.

329
0:17:02.011,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Nobody's going to live beyond 120, 130, 140 years

330
0:17:05.582,000 --> 0:17:06,000
unless if we fix this.

331
0:17:08.084,000 --> 0:17:1,000
And that's the most interesting challenge.

332
0:17:10.174,000 --> 0:17:12,000
That's the next frontier, along with:

333
0:17:12.309,000 --> 0:17:14,000
"How common is life in the universe?"

334
0:17:14.68,000 --> 0:17:15,000
"Where did we come from?"

335
0:17:16.51,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and questions like that.

336
0:17:20.031,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Let me end this with an apocryphal quote from Einstein.

337
0:17:23.697,000 --> 0:17:25,000
[You can live as if everything is a miracle,

338
0:17:25.94,000 --> 0:17:27,000
or you can live as if nothing is a miracle.]

339
0:17:28.236,000 --> 0:17:29,000
It's your choice.

340
0:17:30.555,000 --> 0:17:32,000
You can focus on the bad, you can focus on the scary,

341
0:17:33.058,000 --> 0:17:35,000
and certainly there's a lot of scary out there.

342
0:17:36.012,000 --> 0:17:4,000
But use 10 percent of your brain to focus on that, or maybe 20 percent,

343
0:17:40.768,000 --> 0:17:41,000
or maybe 30 percent.

344
0:17:43.474,000 --> 0:17:44,000
But just remember,

345
0:17:45.28,000 --> 0:17:47,000
we really are living in an age of miracle and wonder.

346
0:17:48.271,000 --> 0:17:51,000
We're lucky to be alive today. We're lucky to see this stuff.

347
0:17:51.846,000 --> 0:17:53,000
We're lucky to be able to interact with folks like the folks

348
0:17:54.711,000 --> 0:17:56,000
who are building all the stuff in this room.

349
0:17:57.487,000 --> 0:17:59,000
So thank you to all of you, for all you do.

350
0:18:01.066,000 --> 0:18:04,000

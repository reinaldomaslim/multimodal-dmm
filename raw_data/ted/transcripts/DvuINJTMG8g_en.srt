1
0:00:12.96,000 --> 0:00:15,000
(Music)

2
0:01:28.2,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I went down

3
0:01:30.8,000 --> 0:01:33,000
to St. James Infirmary

4
0:01:36.8,000 --> 0:01:4,000
To see my baby there

5
0:01:42.2,000 --> 0:01:47,000
She was lying on a long wooden table

6
0:01:49.76,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So cold, so still, so fair

7
0:01:57.32,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I went up to see the doctor

8
0:02:05.04,000 --> 0:02:09,000
"She's very low," he said

9
0:02:10.64,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I went back to see my baby

10
0:02:18.32,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Good God

11
0:02:20.32,000 --> 0:02:26,000
she's lying there dead

12
0:03:07.64,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I went down to old Joe's bar room

13
0:03:14.04,000 --> 0:03:19,000
On the corner of the square

14
0:03:20.72,000 --> 0:03:25,000
They were serving drinks as per usual

15
0:03:26.04,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And the usual crowd was there

16
0:03:31.8,000 --> 0:03:35,000
To my left stood Old Joe McKennedy

17
0:03:37.44,000 --> 0:03:4,000
His eyes were bloodshot red

18
0:03:42.24,000 --> 0:03:46,000
He turned to the crowd around him

19
0:03:47.72,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And these are the words he said

20
0:03:53.6,000 --> 0:03:56,000
"Let her go, let her go, God bless her

21
0:03:59.48,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Wherever she may be

22
0:04:03.68,000 --> 0:04:07,000
She can search this whole wide world all over

23
0:04:08.92,000 --> 0:04:12,000
But she'll never find another man like me

24
0:04:14.56,000 --> 0:04:18,000
She can search this whole wide world all over

25
0:04:19.44,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And she'll never find

26
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
another man

27
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:35,000
like me

28
0:04:46.28,000 --> 0:04:5,000
When I die, please God, bury me

29
0:04:51.68,000 --> 0:04:55,000
In my ten-dollar Stetson hat

30
0:04:57.52,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Put a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chain

31
0:05:02.72,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So my friends know I died standing pat

32
0:05:08.88,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Get six gamblers to carry my coffin

33
0:05:14.4,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And six choir girls to sing me a song

34
0:05:20.36,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

35
0:05:25.72,000 --> 0:05:3,000
To raise hell as I go along

36
0:07:33.08,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Now that's the end of my story

37
0:07:42.6,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Let's have another round of booze

38
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And if anyone should ask you

39
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
Just tell them I got

40
0:08:01.12,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the St. James Infirmary

41
0:08:15.96,000 --> 0:08:18,000
blues

42
0:08:30.04,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Applause)

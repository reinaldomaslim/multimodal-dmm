1
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
For some time I have been interested in

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the placebo effect,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
which might seem like an odd thing

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
for a magician to be interested in,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
unless you think of it in the terms that I do,

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
which is, "Something fake

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
is believed in enough by somebody

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that it becomes something real."

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
In other words, sugar pills

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies,

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the placebo effect,

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
just because the person thinks

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
or some sort of a --

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
for pain management, for example,

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
called the placebo effect.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Something fake becomes

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
something real

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
because of someone's perception of it.

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
In order for us to understand each other,

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I want to start by showing you a rudimentary,

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
very simple magic trick.

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that's been in every children's magic book since at least the 1950s.

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s.

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I'll do it for you, and then I'll explain it.

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And then I'll explain why I explained it.

29
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So, here's what happens.

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The knife, which you can examine; my hand, which you could examine.

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this.

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I'll get my sleeve back.

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here.

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
That way you can see that at no time

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
can anything travel, as long as I'm squeezing there

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
nothing can go up or down my sleeve.

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And the object of this is quite simple.

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I'm going to open my hand,

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and hopefully, if all is well,

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife.

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
In fact it's held so tightly in place

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that I can shake it,

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and the knife does not come off.

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Nothing goes up or down my sleeve,

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
no trickery. And you can examine everything.

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Ta-da!

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Applause)

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So, this is a trick that I often teach to young children

50
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that are interested in magic, because you can learn

51
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
a great deal about deception by studying

52
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
this very -- even though it's a very simple trick methodologically.

53
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Probably many of you in the room know this trick.

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
What happens is this.

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I hold the knife in my hand.

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I say I'm going to grab hold of my wrist

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve,

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that is a lie.

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The reason I'm holding onto my wrist

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is because that's actually the secret

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
of the illusion.

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
In a moment when my hand moves from facing you

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to being away from you,

64
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
this finger right here, my index finger is just going to shift

65
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
from where it is, to a position

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
pointing out like this.

67
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Nice one.

68
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Someone who didn't have a childhood is out there.

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Laughter)

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So, it goes like this, from here, right.

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And as I move around my finger shifts.

72
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And we could talk about why this is deceptive,

73
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here,

74
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
because the mind, and the way it processes information,

75
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
it doesn't count, one, two, three. It groups them.

76
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But that's not really what this is about. Right? And then I open my hand up.

77
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Obviously it's clinging there, not by animal magnetism,

78
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
but by chicanery,

79
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
my index finger being there.

80
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And then when I close my finger, same thing,

81
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
as I move back, this motion

82
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
kind of covers the moving back of my finger.

83
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I take this hand away. You give the knife out.

84
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors. Thanks.

85
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now, (Laughter)

86
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
what does that have to do with the placebo effect?

87
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I read a study a year or so ago

88
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that really blew my mind wide open.

89
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this, to me,

90
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
was an astonishing thing.

91
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It turns out that if you administer

92
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
a placebo in the form of a white pill,

93
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that's like aspirin shaped --

94
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
it's just a round white pill -- it has some certain measurable effect.

95
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But if you change the form that you give the placebo in,

96
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
like you make a smaller pill,

97
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and color it blue, and stamp a letter into it,

98
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
it is actually measurably more effective.

99
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Even though neither one of these things

100
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
has any pharmaceutical -- they're sugar pills.

101
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill.

102
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
What? (Laughter) That really flipped me out.

103
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Turns out though, that that's not even where it stops.

104
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
If you have capsules,

105
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
they're more effective than tablets in any form.

106
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
A colored capsule, that's yellow on one end and red on the other

107
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
is better than a white capsule.

108
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Dosage has something to do with this.

109
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
One pill twice a day

110
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
is not as good at three pills --

111
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I don't remember the statistic now. Sorry.

112
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
But the point is ...

113
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Laughter) ... these dosages have something to do with it.

114
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And the form has something to do with it.

115
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And if you want the ultimate in placebo,

116
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
you've go to the needle.

117
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Right? A syringe with some inert --

118
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
a couple CCs of some inert something,

119
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and you inject this into a patient ...

120
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Well this is such a powerful image in their mind,

121
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
it's so much stronger than the white pill.

122
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
It's a really, this graph, well I'll show it to you

123
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
some other time when we have slides.

124
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The point is

125
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
the white pill is not as good as the blue pill

126
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle.

127
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality,

128
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
it's only your belief that makes it real

129
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
in your body and makes a stronger effect.

130
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I wanted to see if I could take that idea

131
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and apply it to a magic trick.

132
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And take something that is obviously a fake trick

133
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and make it seem real.

134
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And we know from that study

135
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that when you want reality, you go to the needle.

136
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
This is a seven-inch hatpin. It's very, very sharp,

137
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and I'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit.

138
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
This is really my flesh. This is not

139
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Damian's special-grown flesh.

140
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
That's my skin right there. This is not a Hollywood special effect.

141
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I'm going to pierce my skin

142
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and run this needle through to the other side.

143
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
If you're queasy -- (Laughs)

144
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
if you faint easily -- I was doing this for some friends

145
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
in the hotel room last night, and some people that I didn't know,

146
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and one woman almost passed out.

147
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So, I suggest if you get queasy easy

148
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that you look away for about the next 30 --

149
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
in fact, you know what, I'll do the first bad part behind it.

150
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
You'll get to see, you can look away too if you'd like to.

151
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So, here is what happens, right here,

152
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
the beginning of my flesh

153
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
at the lower part of my arm I just make

154
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
a little pierce.

155
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I'm sorry, man. Am I freaking you out?

156
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
OK, and then just through my skin a tiny bit,

157
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and then out the other side like this.

158
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Now, essentially we're in the same position we were in

159
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
with the knife trick.

160
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
(Laughter)

161
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Sort of.

162
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
But you can't count my fingers right now can you?

163
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So, let me show them to you. That's one, two

164
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
three, four, five.

165
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Yes, well...

166
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I know what people think when they see this.

167
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
They go, "Well, he's certainly not dumb enough

168
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes.

169
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So, let me give you a little peek.

170
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
How's that look out there? Pretty good.

171
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Laughs)

172
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Yeah, I know. (Laughs)

173
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And the people in the back go, "OK, I didn't really see that."

174
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
People in the satellite room are starting to move in now.

175
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Let me give you good close look at this.

176
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
That really is my skin. That is not a Hollywood special effect.

177
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
That's my flesh, and I can twist that around.

178
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I'm sorry. If you're getting queasy, look away,

179
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
don't look at the thing.

180
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
People in the back or people on video years from now watching this

181
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
will go, "Well yeah, that looks kind of neat

182
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
in some sort of effect there, but if it were real he would be --

183
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
see there's a hole there and a hole there, if it were real he would be bleeding.

184
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Well let me work up some blood for you.

185
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
(Laughter)

186
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Yes, there it is.

187
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Applause)

188
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Laughter)

189
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Normally now, I would take the needle out.

190
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I would clean off my arm, and I would show you that there are no wounds.

191
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
But I think in this context

192
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and with the idea of taking something fake

193
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and making it into something real,

194
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I'm just going to leave it there,

195
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and walk off the stage.

196
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
(Laughter)

197
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I will be seeing you several times over the next few days.

198
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I hope you're looking forward to that. Thank you very much.

199
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Laughter)

200
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:15.959,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So if you've been following the news,

3
0:00:17.717,000 --> 0:00:19,000
you've heard that there's a pack of giant asteroids

4
0:00:20.206,000 --> 0:00:21,000
headed for the United States,

5
0:00:21.279,000 --> 0:00:24,000
all scheduled to strike within the next 50 years.

6
0:00:24.746,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Now I don't mean actual asteroids made of rock and metal.

7
0:00:27.799,000 --> 0:00:28,000
That actually wouldn't be such a problem,

8
0:00:29.306,000 --> 0:00:31,000
because if we were really all going to die,

9
0:00:31.41,000 --> 0:00:34,000
we would put aside our differences, we'd spend whatever it took,

10
0:00:34.448,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and we'd find a way to deflect them.

11
0:00:36.578,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I'm talking instead about threats that are headed our way,

12
0:00:39.28,000 --> 0:00:41,000
but they're wrapped in a special energy field

13
0:00:41.416,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that polarizes us, and therefore paralyzes us.

14
0:00:45.766,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Last March, I went to the TED conference,

15
0:00:47.67,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and I saw Jim Hansen speak, the NASA scientist

16
0:00:50.506,000 --> 0:00:52,000
who first raised the alarm about global warming in the 1980s,

17
0:00:53.416,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and it seems that the predictions he made back then

18
0:00:55.881,000 --> 0:00:56,000
are coming true.

19
0:00:57.722,000 --> 0:01:,000
This is where we're headed in terms of global temperature rises,

20
0:01:01.209,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and if we keep on going the way we're going,

21
0:01:02.818,000 --> 0:01:05,000
we get a four- or five-degree-Centigrade temperature rise

22
0:01:06.286,000 --> 0:01:07,000
by the end of this century.

23
0:01:07.634,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Hansen says we can expect about a five-meter rise in sea levels.

24
0:01:11.422,000 --> 0:01:14,000
This is what a five-meter rise in sea levels would look like.

25
0:01:14.664,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Low-lying cities all around the world will disappear

26
0:01:17.672,000 --> 0:01:2,000
within the lifetime of children born today.

27
0:01:21.47,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Hansen closed his talk by saying,

28
0:01:23.766,000 --> 0:01:27,000
"Imagine a giant asteroid on a collision course with Earth.

29
0:01:27.903,000 --> 0:01:29,000
That is the equivalent of what we face now.

30
0:01:30.256,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Yet we dither, taking no action to deflect the asteroid,

31
0:01:34.03,000 --> 0:01:35,000
even though the longer we wait,

32
0:01:35.739,000 --> 0:01:38,000
the more difficult and expensive it becomes."

33
0:01:38.816,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Of course, the left wants to take action,

34
0:01:40.623,000 --> 0:01:43,000
but the right denies that there's any problem.

35
0:01:43.959,000 --> 0:01:44,000
All right, so I go back from TED,

36
0:01:45.537,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and then the following week, I'm invited to a dinner party

37
0:01:48.431,000 --> 0:01:5,000
in Washington, D.C., where I know that I'll be meeting

38
0:01:50.896,000 --> 0:01:52,000
a number of conservative intellectuals, including Yuval Levin,

39
0:01:53.638,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and to prepare for the meeting, I read this article by Levin

40
0:01:57.234,000 --> 0:02:,000
in National Affairs called "Beyond the Welfare State."

41
0:02:00.6,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Levin writes that all over the world,

42
0:02:03.799,000 --> 0:02:05,000
nations are coming to terms with the fact

43
0:02:06.01,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that the social democratic welfare state

44
0:02:08.311,000 --> 0:02:11,000
is turning out to be untenable and unaffordable,

45
0:02:11.83,000 --> 0:02:13,000
dependent upon dubious economics

46
0:02:14.394,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and the demographic model of a bygone era.

47
0:02:18.031,000 --> 0:02:2,000
All right, now this might not sound as scary as an asteroid,

48
0:02:20.676,000 --> 0:02:22,000
but look at these graphs that Levin showed.

49
0:02:23.354,000 --> 0:02:25,000
This graph shows the national debt

50
0:02:25.804,000 --> 0:02:28,000
as a percentage of America's GDP, and as you see,

51
0:02:28.886,000 --> 0:02:3,000
if you go all the way back to the founding,

52
0:02:30.967,000 --> 0:02:32,000
we borrowed a lot of money to fight the Revolutionary War.

53
0:02:33.083,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Wars are expensive. But then we'd pay it off, pay it off, pay it off,

54
0:02:36.421,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and then, oh, what's this? The Civil War. Even more expensive.

55
0:02:39.473,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Borrow a lot of money, pay it off, pay it off, pay it off,

56
0:02:42.206,000 --> 0:02:44,000
get down to near zero, and bang! -- World War I.

57
0:02:44.928,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Once again, the same process repeats.

58
0:02:46.63,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Now then we get the Great Depression and World War II.

59
0:02:48.538,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We rise to an astronomical level, around 118 percent of GDP,

60
0:02:52.896,000 --> 0:02:55,000
really unsustainable, really dangerous.

61
0:02:56.576,000 --> 0:03:,000
But we pay it off, pay it off, pay it off, and then, what's this?

62
0:03:01.203,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Why has it been rising since the '70s?

63
0:03:04.212,000 --> 0:03:06,000
It's partly due to tax cuts that were unfunded,

64
0:03:07.005,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but it's due primarily to the rise of entitlement spending,

65
0:03:09.699,000 --> 0:03:11,000
especially Medicare.

66
0:03:11.853,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We're approaching the levels of indebtedness we had at World War II,

67
0:03:14.948,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and the baby boomers haven't even retired yet,

68
0:03:17.939,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and when they do, this is what will happen.

69
0:03:21.209,000 --> 0:03:22,000
This is data from the Congressional Budget Office

70
0:03:22.938,000 --> 0:03:24,000
showing its most realistic forecast of what would happen

71
0:03:25.765,000 --> 0:03:29,000
if current situations and expectations and trends are extended.

72
0:03:29.88,000 --> 0:03:31,000
All right, now what you might notice is that these two graphs

73
0:03:32.812,000 --> 0:03:36,000
are actually identical, not in terms of the x- and y-axes,

74
0:03:37.443,000 --> 0:03:38,000
or in terms of the data they present,

75
0:03:38.638,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but in terms of their moral and political implications, they say the same thing.

76
0:03:43.111,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Let me translate for you.

77
0:03:44.947,000 --> 0:03:47,000
"We are doomed unless we start acting now.

78
0:03:48.614,000 --> 0:03:5,000
What's wrong with you people on the other side in the other party?

79
0:03:51.594,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Can't you see reality? If you won't help, then get the hell out of the way."

80
0:03:55.983,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We can deflect both of these asteroids.

81
0:03:58.264,000 --> 0:04:01,000
These problems are both technically solvable.

82
0:04:01.654,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Our problem and our tragedy is that in these hyper-partisan times,

83
0:04:04.433,000 --> 0:04:06,000
the mere fact that one side says, "Look, there's an asteroid,"

84
0:04:07.425,000 --> 0:04:09,000
means that the other side's going to say, "Huh? What?

85
0:04:09.666,000 --> 0:04:11,000
No, I'm not even going to look up. No."

86
0:04:12.244,000 --> 0:04:15,000
To understand why this is happening to us,

87
0:04:15.348,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and what we can do about it, we need to learn more about moral psychology.

88
0:04:19.394,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So I'm a social psychologist, and I study morality,

89
0:04:22.052,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and one of the most important principles of morality

90
0:04:24.439,000 --> 0:04:27,000
is that morality binds and blinds.

91
0:04:27.689,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It binds us into teams that circle around sacred values

92
0:04:30.123,000 --> 0:04:33,000
but thereby makes us go blind to objective reality.

93
0:04:34.036,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Think of it like this.

94
0:04:35.142,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Large-scale cooperation is extremely rare on this planet.

95
0:04:39.205,000 --> 0:04:41,000
There are only a few species that can do it.

96
0:04:41.364,000 --> 0:04:44,000
That's a beehive. That's a termite mound, a giant termite mound.

97
0:04:44.364,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And when you find this in other animals, it's always the same story.

98
0:04:47.464,000 --> 0:04:51,000
They're always all siblings who are children of a single queen,

99
0:04:52.361,000 --> 0:04:53,000
so they're all in the same boat.

100
0:04:54.22,000 --> 0:04:57,000
They rise or fall, they live or die, as one.

101
0:04:57.541,000 --> 0:04:59,000
There's only one species on the planet that can do this

102
0:04:59.832,000 --> 0:05:01,000
without kinship, and that, of course, is us.

103
0:05:02.407,000 --> 0:05:04,000
This is a reconstruction of ancient Babylon,

104
0:05:04.678,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and this is Tenochtitlan.

105
0:05:07.001,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Now how did we do this? How did we go

106
0:05:09.093,000 --> 0:05:11,000
from being hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago

107
0:05:12.087,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to building these gigantic cities in just a few thousand years?

108
0:05:16.105,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It's miraculous, and part of the explanation

109
0:05:19.148,000 --> 0:05:23,000
is this ability to circle around sacred values.

110
0:05:23.372,000 --> 0:05:26,000
As you see, temples and gods play a big role in all ancient civilizations.

111
0:05:27.296,000 --> 0:05:3,000
This is an image of Muslims circling the Kaaba in Mecca.

112
0:05:31.148,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's a sacred rock, and when people circle something together,

113
0:05:34.293,000 --> 0:05:38,000
they unite, they can trust each other, they become one.

114
0:05:38.664,000 --> 0:05:4,000
It's as though you're moving an electrical wire

115
0:05:40.845,000 --> 0:05:42,000
through a magnetic field that generates current.

116
0:05:42.982,000 --> 0:05:44,000
When people circle together, they generate a current.

117
0:05:45.905,000 --> 0:05:46,000
We love to circle around things.

118
0:05:47.438,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We circle around flags, and then we can trust each other.

119
0:05:51.136,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We can fight as a team, as a unit.

120
0:05:53.977,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But even as morality binds people together into a unit,

121
0:05:57.136,000 --> 0:06:,000
into a team, the circling blinds them.

122
0:06:01.108,000 --> 0:06:02,000
It causes them to distort reality.

123
0:06:02.916,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We begin separating everything into good versus evil.

124
0:06:06.953,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Now that process feels great. It feels really satisfying.

125
0:06:10.851,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But it is a gross distortion of reality.

126
0:06:15.07,000 --> 0:06:18,000
You can see the moral electromagnet operating in the U.S. Congress.

127
0:06:18.478,000 --> 0:06:2,000
This is a graph that shows the degree to which voting

128
0:06:20.71,000 --> 0:06:22,000
in Congress falls strictly along the left-right axis,

129
0:06:23.541,000 --> 0:06:25,000
so that if you know how liberal or conservative someone is,

130
0:06:26.217,000 --> 0:06:29,000
you know exactly how they voted on all the major issues.

131
0:06:29.443,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And what you can see is that,

132
0:06:31.497,000 --> 0:06:33,000
in the decades after the Civil War,

133
0:06:33.882,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Congress was extraordinarily polarized,

134
0:06:36.371,000 --> 0:06:38,000
as you would expect, about as high as can be.

135
0:06:38.914,000 --> 0:06:4,000
But then, after World War I, things dropped,

136
0:06:41.89,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and we get this historically low level of polarization.

137
0:06:44.795,000 --> 0:06:45,000
This was a golden age of bipartisanship,

138
0:06:46.487,000 --> 0:06:49,000
at least in terms of the parties' ability to work together

139
0:06:49.762,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and solve grand national problems.

140
0:06:52.77,000 --> 0:06:56,000
But in the 1980s and '90s, the electromagnet turns back on.

141
0:06:57.219,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Polarization rises.

142
0:07:00.06,000 --> 0:07:02,000
It used to be that conservatives and moderates and liberals

143
0:07:03.026,000 --> 0:07:04,000
could all work together in Congress.

144
0:07:04.858,000 --> 0:07:06,000
They could rearrange themselves, form bipartisan committees,

145
0:07:07.699,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but as the moral electromagnet got cranked up,

146
0:07:10.972,000 --> 0:07:12,000
the force field increased,

147
0:07:13.242,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Democrats and Republicans were pulled apart.

148
0:07:16.006,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It became much harder for them to socialize,

149
0:07:17.993,000 --> 0:07:18,000
much harder for them to cooperate.

150
0:07:19.471,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Retiring members nowadays say that it's become like gang warfare.

151
0:07:24.312,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Did anybody notice that in two of the three debates,

152
0:07:27.824,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Obama wore a blue tie and Romney wore a red tie?

153
0:07:31.34,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Do you know why they do this?

154
0:07:33.326,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It's so that the Bloods and the Crips will know which side to vote for. (Laughter)

155
0:07:37.468,000 --> 0:07:39,000
The polarization is strongest among our political elites.

156
0:07:40.234,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Nobody doubts that this is happening in Washington.

157
0:07:42.412,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But for a while, there was some doubt as to whether it was happening among the people.

158
0:07:45.848,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Well, in the last 12 years it's become

159
0:07:47.156,000 --> 0:07:49,000
much more apparent that it is.

160
0:07:49.243,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So look at this data. This is from the American National Elections Survey.

161
0:07:52.465,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And what they do on that survey is they ask

162
0:07:55.105,000 --> 0:07:57,000
what's called a feeling thermometer rating.

163
0:07:57.117,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So, how warm or cold do you feel about, you know,

164
0:08:01.354,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Native Americans, or the military, the Republican Party,

165
0:08:04.129,000 --> 0:08:06,000
the Democratic Party, all sorts of groups in American life.

166
0:08:07.055,000 --> 0:08:09,000
The blue line shows how warmly Democrats feel

167
0:08:09.737,000 --> 0:08:11,000
about Democrats, and they like them.

168
0:08:12.2,000 --> 0:08:14,000
You know, ratings in the 70s on a 100-point scale.

169
0:08:14.905,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Republicans like Republicans. That's not a surprise.

170
0:08:17.92,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But when you look at cross-party ratings,

171
0:08:19.994,000 --> 0:08:21,000
you find, well, that it's lower, but actually,

172
0:08:22.529,000 --> 0:08:23,000
when I first saw this data, I was surprised.

173
0:08:24.513,000 --> 0:08:27,000
That's actually not so bad. If you go back to the Carter and even Reagan administrations,

174
0:08:27.808,000 --> 0:08:31,000
they were rating the other party 43, 45. It's not terrible.

175
0:08:32.385,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It drifts downwards very slightly,

176
0:08:34.7,000 --> 0:08:37,000
but now look what happens under George W. Bush and Obama.

177
0:08:38.561,000 --> 0:08:4,000
It plummets. Something is going on here.

178
0:08:41.313,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The moral electromagnet is turning back on,

179
0:08:43.714,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and nowadays, just very recently,

180
0:08:45.874,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Democrats really dislike Republicans.

181
0:08:48.114,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Republicans really dislike the Democrats. We're changing.

182
0:08:51.63,000 --> 0:08:53,000
It's as though the moral electromagnet is affecting us too.

183
0:08:54.48,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It's like put out in the two oceans and it's pulling the whole country apart,

184
0:08:58.205,000 --> 0:09:01,000
pulling left and right into their own territories

185
0:09:02.161,000 --> 0:09:04,000
like the Bloods and the Crips.

186
0:09:04.97,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Now, there are many reasons why this is happening to us,

187
0:09:07.984,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and many of them we cannot reverse.

188
0:09:10.904,000 --> 0:09:12,000
We will never again have a political class

189
0:09:13.401,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that was forged by the experience of fighting together

190
0:09:16.96,000 --> 0:09:18,000
in World War II against a common enemy.

191
0:09:19.704,000 --> 0:09:22,000
We will never again have just three television networks,

192
0:09:23.238,000 --> 0:09:26,000
all of which are relatively centrist.

193
0:09:26.411,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And we will never again have a large group of conservative southern Democrats

194
0:09:31.251,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and liberal northern Republicans making it easy,

195
0:09:35.042,000 --> 0:09:39,000
making there be a lot of overlap for bipartisan cooperation.

196
0:09:39.36,000 --> 0:09:41,000
So for a lot of reasons, those decades after the Second World War

197
0:09:42.008,000 --> 0:09:43,000
were an historically anomalous time.

198
0:09:43.811,000 --> 0:09:46,000
We will never get back to those low levels of polarization, I believe.

199
0:09:47.528,000 --> 0:09:49,000
But there's a lot that we can do. There are dozens

200
0:09:50.126,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and dozens of reforms we can do that will make things better,

201
0:09:53.272,000 --> 0:09:55,000
because a lot of our dysfunction can be traced directly

202
0:09:55.696,000 --> 0:09:58,000
to things that Congress did to itself in the 1990s

203
0:09:59.319,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that created a much more polarized and dysfunctional institution.

204
0:10:04.414,000 --> 0:10:06,000
These changes are detailed in many books.

205
0:10:06.606,000 --> 0:10:08,000
These are two that I strongly recommend,

206
0:10:08.846,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and they list a whole bunch of reforms.

207
0:10:10.997,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I'm just going to group them into three broad classes here.

208
0:10:13.767,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So if you think about this as the problem of a dysfunctional,

209
0:10:16.805,000 --> 0:10:19,000
hyper-polarized institution, well, the first step is,

210
0:10:20.149,000 --> 0:10:25,000
do what you can so that fewer hyper-partisans get elected in the first place,

211
0:10:25.423,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and when you have closed party primaries,

212
0:10:26.817,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and only the most committed Republicans and Democrats are voting,

213
0:10:29.881,000 --> 0:10:32,000
you're nominating and selecting the most extreme hyper-partisans.

214
0:10:33.877,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So open primaries would make that problem much, much less severe.

215
0:10:37.464,000 --> 0:10:41,000
But the problem isn't primarily that we're electing bad people to Congress.

216
0:10:42.215,000 --> 0:10:45,000
From my experience, and from what I've heard from Congressional insiders,

217
0:10:45.615,000 --> 0:10:47,000
most of the people going to Congress are good, hard-working,

218
0:10:48.595,000 --> 0:10:5,000
intelligent people who really want to solve problems,

219
0:10:51.256,000 --> 0:10:53,000
but once they get there, they find that they are forced

220
0:10:53.881,000 --> 0:10:55,000
to play a game that rewards hyper-partisanship

221
0:10:56.812,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and that punishes independent thinking.

222
0:10:58.461,000 --> 0:11:,000
You step out of line, you get punished.

223
0:11:01.039,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So there are a lot of reforms we could do

224
0:11:02.806,000 --> 0:11:03,000
that will counteract this.

225
0:11:03.978,000 --> 0:11:06,000
For example, this "Citizens United" ruling is a disaster,

226
0:11:07.198,000 --> 0:11:09,000
because it means there's like a money gun aimed at your head,

227
0:11:09.397,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and if you step out of line, if you try to reach across the aisle,

228
0:11:12.162,000 --> 0:11:14,000
there's a ton of money waiting to be given to your opponent

229
0:11:14.678,000 --> 0:11:19,000
to make everybody think that you are a terrible person through negative advertising.

230
0:11:20.343,000 --> 0:11:22,000
But the third class of reforms is that we've got to change

231
0:11:22.646,000 --> 0:11:24,000
the nature of social relationships in Congress.

232
0:11:25.473,000 --> 0:11:29,000
The politicians I've met are generally very extroverted,

233
0:11:29.784,000 --> 0:11:32,000
friendly, very socially skillful people,

234
0:11:32.855,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and that's the nature of politics. You've got to make relationships,

235
0:11:36.209,000 --> 0:11:39,000
make deals, you've got to cajole, please, flatter,

236
0:11:39.488,000 --> 0:11:41,000
you've got to use your personal skills,

237
0:11:41.873,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and that's the way politics has always worked.

238
0:11:44.264,000 --> 0:11:47,000
But beginning in the 1990s, first the House of Representatives

239
0:11:47.344,000 --> 0:11:49,000
changed its legislative calendar

240
0:11:49.729,000 --> 0:11:52,000
so that all business is basically done in the middle of the week.

241
0:11:53.385,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Nowadays, Congressmen fly in on Tuesday morning,

242
0:11:55.614,000 --> 0:11:57,000
they do battle for two days, then they fly home Thursday afternoon.

243
0:11:58.463,000 --> 0:11:59,000
They don't move their families to the District.

244
0:12:00.368,000 --> 0:12:02,000
They don't meet each other's spouses or children.

245
0:12:02.686,000 --> 0:12:04,000
There's no more relationship there.

246
0:12:05.2,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And trying to run Congress without human relationships

247
0:12:08.996,000 --> 0:12:1,000
is like trying to run a car without motor oil.

248
0:12:11.823,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Should we be surprised when the whole thing freezes up

249
0:12:14.66,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and descends into paralysis and polarization?

250
0:12:18.493,000 --> 0:12:19,000
A simple change to the legislative calendar,

251
0:12:20.244,000 --> 0:12:22,000
such as having business stretch out for three weeks

252
0:12:22.571,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and then they get a week off to go home,

253
0:12:24.134,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that would change the fundamental relationships in Congress.

254
0:12:27.459,000 --> 0:12:3,000
So there's a lot we can do, but who's going to push them to do it?

255
0:12:30.595,000 --> 0:12:32,000
There are a number of groups that are working on this.

256
0:12:32.979,000 --> 0:12:34,000
No Labels and Common Cause, I think,

257
0:12:35.131,000 --> 0:12:37,000
have very good ideas for changes we need to do

258
0:12:37.27,000 --> 0:12:4,000
to make our democracy more responsive and our Congress more effective.

259
0:12:40.435,000 --> 0:12:41,000
But I'd like to supplement their work

260
0:12:42.258,000 --> 0:12:46,000
with a little psychological trick, and the trick is this.

261
0:12:46.322,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Nothing pulls people together like a common threat

262
0:12:49.372,000 --> 0:12:52,000
or a common attack, especially an attack from a foreign enemy,

263
0:12:53.165,000 --> 0:12:58,000
unless of course that threat hits on our polarized psychology,

264
0:12:58.487,000 --> 0:13:,000
in which case, as I said before, it can actually pull us apart.

265
0:13:01.441,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Sometimes a single threat can polarize us, as we saw.

266
0:13:04.364,000 --> 0:13:07,000
But what if the situation we face is not a single threat

267
0:13:07.474,000 --> 0:13:08,000
but is actually more like this,

268
0:13:09.311,000 --> 0:13:1,000
where there's just so much stuff coming in,

269
0:13:10.741,000 --> 0:13:12,000
it's just, "Start shooting, come on, everybody,

270
0:13:12.822,000 --> 0:13:14,000
we've got to just work together, just start shooting."

271
0:13:15.072,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Because actually, we do face this situation.

272
0:13:17.697,000 --> 0:13:19,000
This is where we are as a country.

273
0:13:20.233,000 --> 0:13:22,000
So here's another asteroid.

274
0:13:22.427,000 --> 0:13:23,000
We've all seen versions of this graph, right,

275
0:13:24.103,000 --> 0:13:27,000
which shows the changes in wealth since 1979,

276
0:13:27.937,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and as you can see, almost all the gains in wealth

277
0:13:30.536,000 --> 0:13:34,000
have gone to the top 20 percent, and especially the top one percent.

278
0:13:35.43,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Rising inequality like this is associated

279
0:13:37.558,000 --> 0:13:39,000
with so many problems for a democracy.

280
0:13:40.231,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Especially, it destroys our ability to trust each other,

281
0:13:43.199,000 --> 0:13:46,000
to feel that we're all in the same boat, because it's obvious we're not.

282
0:13:46.652,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Some of us are sitting there safe and sound in gigantic private yachts.

283
0:13:49.61,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Other people are clinging to a piece of driftwood.

284
0:13:51.2,000 --> 0:13:53,000
We're not all in the same boat, and that means

285
0:13:53.252,000 --> 0:13:57,000
nobody's willing to sacrifice for the common good.

286
0:13:58.161,000 --> 0:14:,000
The left has been screaming about this asteroid for 30 years now,

287
0:14:01.037,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and the right says, "Huh, what? Hmm? No problem. No problem."

288
0:14:05.979,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Now,

289
0:14:08.558,000 --> 0:14:1,000
why is that happening to us? Why is the inequality rising?

290
0:14:10.907,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Well, one of the largest causes, after globalization,

291
0:14:14.525,000 --> 0:14:16,000
is actually this fourth asteroid,

292
0:14:17.371,000 --> 0:14:18,000
rising non-marital births.

293
0:14:19.346,000 --> 0:14:21,000
This graph shows the steady rise of out-of-wedlock births

294
0:14:22.282,000 --> 0:14:23,000
since the 1960s.

295
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Most Hispanic and black children are now born to unmarried mothers.

296
0:14:27.539,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Whites are headed that way too.

297
0:14:29.947,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Within a decade or two, most American children

298
0:14:32.292,000 --> 0:14:34,000
will be born into homes with no father.

299
0:14:35.161,000 --> 0:14:37,000
This means that there's much less money coming into the house.

300
0:14:37.515,000 --> 0:14:4,000
But it's not just money. It's also stability versus chaos.

301
0:14:41.473,000 --> 0:14:43,000
As I know from working with street children in Brazil,

302
0:14:43.708,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Mom's boyfriend is often a really, really dangerous person for kids.

303
0:14:48.77,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Now the right has been screaming about this asteroid since the 1960s,

304
0:14:52.787,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and the left has been saying, "It's not a problem. It's not a problem."

305
0:14:56.666,000 --> 0:14:57,000
The left has been very reluctant to say

306
0:14:58.372,000 --> 0:15:01,000
that marriage is actually good for women and for children.

307
0:15:01.977,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Now let me be clear. I'm not blaming the women here.

308
0:15:03.938,000 --> 0:15:04,000
I'm actually more critical of the men

309
0:15:05.432,000 --> 0:15:06,000
who won't take responsibility for their own children

310
0:15:07.425,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and of an economic system that makes it difficult

311
0:15:10.256,000 --> 0:15:13,000
for many men to earn enough money to support those children.

312
0:15:13.489,000 --> 0:15:17,000
But even if you blame nobody, it still is a national problem,

313
0:15:17.857,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and one side has been more concerned about it than the other.

314
0:15:21.592,000 --> 0:15:23,000
The New York Times finally noticed this asteroid

315
0:15:23.825,000 --> 0:15:25,000
with a front-page story last July

316
0:15:26.105,000 --> 0:15:3,000
showing how the decline of marriage contributes to inequality.

317
0:15:30.319,000 --> 0:15:33,000
We are becoming a nation of just two classes.

318
0:15:33.913,000 --> 0:15:35,000
When Americans go to college and marry each other,

319
0:15:36.655,000 --> 0:15:38,000
they have very low divorce rates.

320
0:15:39.355,000 --> 0:15:42,000
They earn a lot of money, they invest that money in their kids,

321
0:15:42.4,000 --> 0:15:43,000
some of them become tiger mothers,

322
0:15:43.943,000 --> 0:15:44,000
the kids rise to their full potential,

323
0:15:45.619,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and the kids go on to become

324
0:15:48.042,000 --> 0:15:52,000
the top two lines in this graph.

325
0:15:52.333,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And then there's everybody else:

326
0:15:54.963,000 --> 0:15:57,000
the children who don't benefit from a stable marriage,

327
0:15:58.207,000 --> 0:15:59,000
who don't have as much invested in them,

328
0:15:59.91,000 --> 0:16:,000
who don't grow up in a stable environment,

329
0:16:01.694,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and who go on to become the bottom three lines in that graph.

330
0:16:06.652,000 --> 0:16:09,000
So once again, we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing.

331
0:16:10.217,000 --> 0:16:13,000
As before, we've got a problem, we've got to start working on this,

332
0:16:13.231,000 --> 0:16:15,000
we've got to do something,

333
0:16:15.263,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and what's wrong with you people that you don't see my threat?

334
0:16:17.903,000 --> 0:16:2,000
But if everybody could just take off their partisan blinders,

335
0:16:21.705,000 --> 0:16:23,000
we'd see that these two problems actually

336
0:16:24.308,000 --> 0:16:26,000
are best addressed together.

337
0:16:27.055,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Because if you really care about income inequality,

338
0:16:28.798,000 --> 0:16:3,000
you might want to talk to some evangelical Christian groups

339
0:16:31.105,000 --> 0:16:34,000
that are working on ways to promote marriage.

340
0:16:34.236,000 --> 0:16:36,000
But then you're going to run smack into the problem

341
0:16:36.442,000 --> 0:16:38,000
that women don't generally want to marry someone

342
0:16:38.97,000 --> 0:16:4,000
who doesn't have a job.

343
0:16:41.322,000 --> 0:16:42,000
So if you really care about strengthening families,

344
0:16:43.135,000 --> 0:16:44,000
you might want to talk to some liberal groups

345
0:16:44.796,000 --> 0:16:47,000
who are working on promoting educational equality,

346
0:16:48.202,000 --> 0:16:49,000
who are working on raising the minimum wage,

347
0:16:49.962,000 --> 0:16:51,000
who are working on finding ways to stop so many men

348
0:16:52.802,000 --> 0:16:54,000
from being sucked into the criminal justice system and

349
0:16:54.841,000 --> 0:16:57,000
taken out of the marriage market for their whole lives.

350
0:16:58.195,000 --> 0:17:03,000
So to conclude, there are at least four asteroids headed our way.

351
0:17:04.043,000 --> 0:17:06,000
How many of you can see all four?

352
0:17:06.835,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Please raise your hand right now if you're willing to admit

353
0:17:09.45,000 --> 0:17:11,000
that all four of these are national problems.

354
0:17:12.443,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Please raise your hands.

355
0:17:14.3,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Okay, almost all of you.

356
0:17:15.947,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Well, congratulations, you guys are the inaugural members

357
0:17:18.789,000 --> 0:17:21,000
of the Asteroids Club, which is a club

358
0:17:22.052,000 --> 0:17:25,000
for all Americans who are willing to admit

359
0:17:25.293,000 --> 0:17:27,000
that the other side actually might have a point.

360
0:17:28.196,000 --> 0:17:31,000
In the Asteroids Club, we don't start by looking for common ground.

361
0:17:31.227,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Common ground is often very hard to find.

362
0:17:33.121,000 --> 0:17:35,000
No, we start by looking for common threats

363
0:17:35.305,000 --> 0:17:38,000
because common threats make common ground.

364
0:17:38.974,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Now, am I being naive? Is it naive to think

365
0:17:42.798,000 --> 0:17:43,000
that people could ever lay down their swords,

366
0:17:44.169,000 --> 0:17:47,000
and left and right could actually work together?

367
0:17:47.775,000 --> 0:17:49,000
I don't think so, because it happens,

368
0:17:50.262,000 --> 0:17:53,000
not all that often, but there are a variety of examples that point the way.

369
0:17:54.126,000 --> 0:17:55,000
This is something we can do.

370
0:17:55.565,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Because Americans on both sides care about the decline in civility,

371
0:17:59.6,000 --> 0:18:,000
and they've formed dozens of organizations,

372
0:18:01.351,000 --> 0:18:03,000
at the national level, such as this one,

373
0:18:03.524,000 --> 0:18:04,000
down to many local organizations,

374
0:18:05.172,000 --> 0:18:07,000
such as To The Village Square in Tallahassee, Florida,

375
0:18:07.53,000 --> 0:18:09,000
which tries to bring state leaders together to help facilitate

376
0:18:10.005,000 --> 0:18:13,000
that sort of working together human relationship

377
0:18:13.451,000 --> 0:18:16,000
that's necessary to solve Florida's problems.

378
0:18:16.491,000 --> 0:18:2,000
Americans on both sides care about global poverty and AIDS,

379
0:18:20.886,000 --> 0:18:22,000
and on so many humanitarian issues,

380
0:18:23.782,000 --> 0:18:26,000
liberals and evangelicals are actually natural allies,

381
0:18:26.806,000 --> 0:18:27,000
and at times they really have worked together

382
0:18:28.689,000 --> 0:18:29,000
to solve these problems.

383
0:18:30.606,000 --> 0:18:32,000
And most surprisingly to me, they sometimes can even see

384
0:18:33.329,000 --> 0:18:34,000
eye to eye on criminal justice.

385
0:18:35.325,000 --> 0:18:38,000
For example, the incarceration rate, the prison population

386
0:18:39.278,000 --> 0:18:42,000
in this country has quadrupled since 1980.

387
0:18:43.231,000 --> 0:18:45,000
Now this is a social disaster,

388
0:18:45.815,000 --> 0:18:47,000
and liberals are very concerned about this.

389
0:18:47.867,000 --> 0:18:49,000
The Southern Poverty Law Center is often fighting

390
0:18:50.654,000 --> 0:18:52,000
the prison-industrial complex, fighting to prevent a system

391
0:18:53.526,000 --> 0:18:55,000
that's just sucking in more and more poor young men.

392
0:18:56.304,000 --> 0:18:58,000
But are conservatives happy about this?

393
0:18:58.637,000 --> 0:19:01,000
Well, Grover Norquist isn't, because this system

394
0:19:01.719,000 --> 0:19:04,000
costs an unbelievable amount of money.

395
0:19:04.791,000 --> 0:19:06,000
And so, because the prison-industrial complex

396
0:19:07.37,000 --> 0:19:11,000
is bankrupting our states and corroding our souls,

397
0:19:11.607,000 --> 0:19:14,000
groups of fiscal conservatives and Christian conservatives

398
0:19:15.339,000 --> 0:19:18,000
have come together to form a group called Right on Crime.

399
0:19:19.171,000 --> 0:19:21,000
And at times they have worked with the Southern Poverty Law Center

400
0:19:21.827,000 --> 0:19:22,000
to oppose the building of new prisons

401
0:19:23.805,000 --> 0:19:26,000
and to work for reforms that will make the justice system

402
0:19:27.146,000 --> 0:19:3,000
more efficient and more humane.

403
0:19:30.267,000 --> 0:19:33,000
So this is possible. We can do it.

404
0:19:33.562,000 --> 0:19:36,000
Let us therefore go to battle stations,

405
0:19:36.643,000 --> 0:19:37,000
not to fight each other,

406
0:19:37.902,000 --> 0:19:4,000
but to begin deflecting these incoming asteroids.

407
0:19:41.228,000 --> 0:19:44,000
And let our first mission be to press Congress

408
0:19:44.299,000 --> 0:19:47,000
to reform itself, before it's too late for our nation.

409
0:19:48.242,000 --> 0:19:52,000
Thank you. (Applause)

2
0:00:13.175,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I wanted to be a psychologist since I was a teenager,

3
0:00:17.087,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and I spent years pursuing that one goal.

4
0:00:20.429,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I opened my private practice as soon as I was licensed.

5
0:00:24.469,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It was a risky move, not getting a day job at a hospital or a clinic,

6
0:00:28.531,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but within one year, my practice was doing quite well

7
0:00:31.802,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and I was making more money than I ever made before.

8
0:00:35.691,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Of course, I was a full-time student my entire life.

9
0:00:38.723,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:39.79,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I could have worked at McDonald's

11
0:00:41.411,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and made more money than I ever made before.

12
0:00:44.215,000 --> 0:00:47,000
That one-year mark came on a Friday night in July.

13
0:00:48.394,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I walked home to my apartment

14
0:00:50.077,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and got into the elevator with a neighbor who was a doctor in the ER.

15
0:00:54.529,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The elevator rose,

16
0:00:56.101,000 --> 0:00:59,000
then it shuddered and stalled between floors.

17
0:00:59.347,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And the man who dealt with emergencies for a living

18
0:01:02.419,000 --> 0:01:04,000
began poking at the buttons and banging on the door, saying,

19
0:01:05.337,000 --> 0:01:07,000
"This is my nightmare, this is my nightmare!"

20
0:01:08.061,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And I was like, "And this is my nightmare."

21
0:01:10.125,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:13.577,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I felt terrible afterwards, though.

23
0:01:15.932,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Because I wasn't panicked

24
0:01:17.742,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and I knew what to say to calm him down.

25
0:01:20.512,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I was just too depleted to do it,

26
0:01:22.781,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I had nothing left to give, and that confused me.

27
0:01:28.167,000 --> 0:01:3,000
After all, I was finally living my dream,

28
0:01:30.667,000 --> 0:01:31,000
so why wasn't I happy?

29
0:01:33.278,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Why did I feel so burned out?

30
0:01:36.714,000 --> 0:01:37,000
For a few terrible weeks,

31
0:01:38.736,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I questioned whether I'd made a mistake.

32
0:01:41.633,000 --> 0:01:43,000
What if I had chosen the wrong profession?

33
0:01:44.3,000 --> 0:01:48,000
What if I had spent my entire life pursuing the wrong career?

34
0:01:49.639,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But then I realized, no, I still loved psychology.

35
0:01:53.718,000 --> 0:01:56,000
The problem wasn't the work I did in my office.

36
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
It was the hours I spent ruminating about work

37
0:02:00.871,000 --> 0:02:01,000
when I was home.

38
0:02:02.172,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I closed the door to my office every night,

39
0:02:04.268,000 --> 0:02:07,000
but the door in my head remained wide-open

40
0:02:07.962,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and the stress just flooded in.

41
0:02:10.938,000 --> 0:02:12,000
That's the interesting thing about work stress.

42
0:02:14.033,000 --> 0:02:17,000
We don't really experience much of it at work.

43
0:02:17.522,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We're too busy.

44
0:02:18.846,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We experience it outside of work,

45
0:02:21.903,000 --> 0:02:22,000
when we are commuting,

46
0:02:23.427,000 --> 0:02:24,000
when we're home,

47
0:02:24.866,000 --> 0:02:26,000
when we're trying to rejuvenate.

48
0:02:27.223,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It is important to recover in our spare time,

49
0:02:29.841,000 --> 0:02:31,000
to de-stress and do things we enjoy,

50
0:02:32.585,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and the biggest obstruction we face in that regard is ruminating.

51
0:02:36.673,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Because each time we do it,

52
0:02:38.53,000 --> 0:02:41,000
we're actually activating our stress response.

53
0:02:41.784,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Now, to ruminate means to chew over.

54
0:02:45.014,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The word refers to how cows digest their food.

55
0:02:49.09,000 --> 0:02:53,000
For those of you unfamiliar with the joys of cow digestion,

56
0:02:53.241,000 --> 0:02:54,000
cows chew,

57
0:02:54.811,000 --> 0:02:55,000
then they swallow,

58
0:02:56.106,000 --> 0:02:59,000
then they regurgitate it back up and chew it again.

59
0:02:59.142,000 --> 0:03:,000
(Laughter)

60
0:03:00.255,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It's disgusting.

61
0:03:01.439,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:02.47,000 --> 0:03:03,000
But it works for cows.

63
0:03:03.962,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:05.022,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It does not work for humans.

65
0:03:07.443,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Because what we chew over are the upsetting things,

66
0:03:10.76,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the distressing things,

67
0:03:12.458,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and we do it in ways that are entirely unproductive.

68
0:03:16.934,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It's the hours we spend obsessing about tasks we didn't complete

69
0:03:21.038,000 --> 0:03:24,000
or stewing about tensions with a colleague,

70
0:03:24.331,000 --> 0:03:25,000
or anxiously worrying about the future,

71
0:03:26.232,000 --> 0:03:28,000
or second-guessing decisions we've made.

72
0:03:29.463,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Now there's a lot of research on how we think about work

73
0:03:33.463,000 --> 0:03:35,000
when we are not at work,

74
0:03:35.836,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and the findings are quite alarming.

75
0:03:38.589,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Ruminating about work,

76
0:03:39.972,000 --> 0:03:43,000
replaying the same thoughts and worries over and over again,

77
0:03:44.272,000 --> 0:03:49,000
significantly disrupts our ability to recover and recharge in the off hours.

78
0:03:49.851,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The more we ruminate about work when we're home,

79
0:03:52.735,000 --> 0:03:55,000
the more likely we are to experience sleep disturbances,

80
0:03:56.41,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to eat unhealthier foods

81
0:03:58.671,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and to have worse moods.

82
0:04:00.171,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It may even increase our risk of cardiovascular disease

83
0:04:04.687,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and of impairing our executive functioning,

84
0:04:07.655,000 --> 0:04:09,000
the very skill sets we need to do our jobs well.

85
0:04:10.512,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Not to mention the toll it takes on our relationships and family lives,

86
0:04:13.995,000 --> 0:04:17,000
because people around us can tell we're checked out and preoccupied.

87
0:04:18.591,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Now, those same studies found

88
0:04:20.544,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that while ruminating about work when we're home

89
0:04:23.48,000 --> 0:04:25,000
damages our emotional well-being,

90
0:04:25.957,000 --> 0:04:29,000
thinking about work in creative or problem-solving ways does not.

91
0:04:31.116,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Because those kinds of thinking do not elicit emotional distress

92
0:04:35.291,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and, more importantly, they're in our control.

93
0:04:38.807,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We can decide whether to respond to an email

94
0:04:41.043,000 --> 0:04:42,000
or leave it till morning,

95
0:04:43.006,000 --> 0:04:46,000
or whether we want to brainstorm about work projects that excite us.

96
0:04:47.085,000 --> 0:04:49,000
But ruminations are involuntary.

97
0:04:50.217,000 --> 0:04:51,000
They're intrusive.

98
0:04:51.741,000 --> 0:04:53,000
They pop into our head when we don't want them to.

99
0:04:54.551,000 --> 0:04:57,000
They upset us when we don't want to be upset.

100
0:04:57.821,000 --> 0:05:01,000
They switch us on when we are trying to switch off.

101
0:05:01.892,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And they are very difficult to resist,

102
0:05:04.892,000 --> 0:05:07,000
because thinking of all our unfinished tasks feels urgent.

103
0:05:09.082,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Anxiously worrying about the future feels compelling.

104
0:05:13.069,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Ruminating always feels like we're doing something important,

105
0:05:17.173,000 --> 0:05:19,000
when in fact, we're doing something harmful.

106
0:05:20.134,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And we all do it far more than we realize.

107
0:05:23.563,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Back when I was burned out,

108
0:05:25.182,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I decided to keep a journal for a week

109
0:05:27.833,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and document exactly how much time I spent ruminating.

110
0:05:31.942,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And I was horrified by the results.

111
0:05:34.435,000 --> 0:05:37,000
It was over 30 minutes a night when I was trying to fall asleep.

112
0:05:38.157,000 --> 0:05:41,000
My entire commute, to and from my office --

113
0:05:41.585,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that was 45 minutes a day.

114
0:05:44.125,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Totally checked out for 20 minutes

115
0:05:46.355,000 --> 0:05:48,000
during the dinner party at a colleague's house.

116
0:05:48.95,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Never got invited there again.

117
0:05:50.442,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Laughter)

118
0:05:51.474,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And 90 minutes during a friend's "talent show"

119
0:05:55.196,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that, coincidentally, was 90 minutes long.

120
0:05:58.468,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Laughter)

121
0:05:59.674,000 --> 0:06:03,000
In total, that week, it was almost 14 hours.

122
0:06:04.484,000 --> 0:06:06,000
That's how much "downtime" I was losing

123
0:06:06.937,000 --> 0:06:09,000
to something that actually increased my stress.

124
0:06:09.99,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Try keeping a journal for one week.

125
0:06:11.951,000 --> 0:06:12,000
See how much you do it.

126
0:06:14.085,000 --> 0:06:17,000
That's what made me realize that I still loved my work.

127
0:06:17.792,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But ruminating was destroying that love

128
0:06:20.601,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and it was destroying my personal life, too.

129
0:06:23.712,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So I read every study I could find,

130
0:06:26.109,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and I went to war against my ruminations.

131
0:06:28.982,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Now, habit change is hard.

132
0:06:31.513,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It took real diligence to catch myself ruminating each time,

133
0:06:35.458,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and real consistency to make the new habits stick.

134
0:06:39.061,000 --> 0:06:4,000
But eventually, they did.

135
0:06:41.378,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I won my war against ruminating,

136
0:06:43.647,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and I'm here to tell you how you can win yours.

137
0:06:47.235,000 --> 0:06:5,000
First, you need clear guardrails.

138
0:06:50.823,000 --> 0:06:52,000
You have to define when you switch off every night,

139
0:06:53.53,000 --> 0:06:54,000
when you stop working.

140
0:06:55.252,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And you have to be strict about it.

141
0:06:57.95,000 --> 0:07:02,000
The rule I made to myself at the time was that I was done at 8pm.

142
0:07:03.617,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And I forced myself to stick to it.

143
0:07:06.22,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Now people say to me,

144
0:07:07.41,000 --> 0:07:1,000
"Really? You didn't return a single email after 8pm?

145
0:07:11.354,000 --> 0:07:13,000
You didn't even look at your phone?"

146
0:07:13.657,000 --> 0:07:15,000
No, not once.

147
0:07:16.292,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Because it was the '90s, we didn't have smartphones.

148
0:07:18.815,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

149
0:07:20.613,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I got my first smartphone in 2007.

150
0:07:23.542,000 --> 0:07:24,000
You know, the iPhone had just come out,

151
0:07:25.463,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and I wanted a phone that was cool and hip.

152
0:07:28.264,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I got a BlackBerry.

153
0:07:29.939,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Laughter)

154
0:07:31.123,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I was excited, though,

155
0:07:32.321,000 --> 0:07:35,000
you know, my first thought was, "I get my emails wherever I am."

156
0:07:35.678,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And 24 hours later,

157
0:07:37.178,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I was like, "I get my emails wherever I am."

158
0:07:39.781,000 --> 0:07:4,000
(Laughter)

159
0:07:41.292,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I mean, battling ruminations was hard enough

160
0:07:43.364,000 --> 0:07:44,000
when they just invaded our thoughts.

161
0:07:45.252,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But now they have this Trojan horse,

162
0:07:47.497,000 --> 0:07:48,000
our phones, to hide within.

163
0:07:49.268,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And each time we just look at our phone after hours,

164
0:07:52.307,000 --> 0:07:53,000
we can be reminded of work

165
0:07:54.03,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and ruminative thoughts can slip out

166
0:07:56.3,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and slaughter our evening or weekend.

167
0:07:59.211,000 --> 0:08:,000
So, when you switch off,

168
0:08:01.1,000 --> 0:08:03,000
switch off your email notifications.

169
0:08:03.417,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And if you have to check them, decide on when to do it,

170
0:08:06.378,000 --> 0:08:07,000
so it doesn't interfere with your plans,

171
0:08:08.376,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and do it only then.

172
0:08:10.449,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Cell phones aren't the only way technology is empowering rumination,

173
0:08:15.21,000 --> 0:08:17,000
because we have an even bigger fight coming.

174
0:08:18.211,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Telecommuting has increased 115 percent over the past decade.

175
0:08:23.159,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And it's expected to increase even more dramatically going forward.

176
0:08:27.088,000 --> 0:08:3,000
More and more of us are losing our physical boundary

177
0:08:30.381,000 --> 0:08:31,000
between work and home.

178
0:08:32.704,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And that means that reminders of work

179
0:08:34.585,000 --> 0:08:37,000
will be able to trigger ruminations from anywhere in our home.

180
0:08:38.577,000 --> 0:08:42,000
When we lack a physical boundary between work and home,

181
0:08:42.635,000 --> 0:08:44,000
we have to create a psychological one.

182
0:08:45.294,000 --> 0:08:46,000
We have to trick our mind

183
0:08:47.247,000 --> 0:08:5,000
into defining work and nonwork times and spaces.

184
0:08:51.588,000 --> 0:08:52,000
So here's how you do that.

185
0:08:52.973,000 --> 0:08:55,000
First, create a defined work zone in your home,

186
0:08:56.925,000 --> 0:08:57,000
even if it's tiny,

187
0:08:58.282,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and try to work only there.

188
0:09:00.711,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Try not to work on the living room couch

189
0:09:02.774,000 --> 0:09:03,000
or on the bed

190
0:09:03.963,000 --> 0:09:05,000
because really, those areas should be associated

191
0:09:06.251,000 --> 0:09:07,000
with living and ... bedding.

192
0:09:08.838,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Laughter)

193
0:09:09.862,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Next, when you're working from home,

194
0:09:12.283,000 --> 0:09:14,000
wear clothes you only wear when you're working.

195
0:09:15.077,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And then at the end of the day,

196
0:09:16.626,000 --> 0:09:17,000
change clothes,

197
0:09:17.847,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and use music and lighting to shift the atmosphere

198
0:09:21.577,000 --> 0:09:22,000
from work to home.

199
0:09:23.559,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Make it a ritual.

200
0:09:24.884,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Now, some of you might think that's silly.

201
0:09:27.194,000 --> 0:09:28,000
That changing clothes and lighting

202
0:09:29.033,000 --> 0:09:31,000
will convince my mind I'm no longer at work.

203
0:09:31.67,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Trust me, your mind will fall for it.

204
0:09:34.125,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Because we are really smart, our mind is really stupid.

205
0:09:36.77,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Laughter)

206
0:09:37.809,000 --> 0:09:39,000
It falls for random associations all the time, right?

207
0:09:40.32,000 --> 0:09:43,000
I mean, that's why Pavlov's dog began drooling at the sound of a bell.

208
0:09:44.204,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And why TED speakers begin sweating at the sight of a red circle.

209
0:09:47.641,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Laughter)

210
0:09:49.069,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Now those things will help,

211
0:09:50.744,000 --> 0:09:52,000
but ruminations will still invade.

212
0:09:53.046,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And when they do, you have to convert them

213
0:09:55.649,000 --> 0:09:58,000
into productive forms of thinking, like problem-solving.

214
0:09:59.611,000 --> 0:10:01,000
My patient Sally is a good example.

215
0:10:01.881,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Sally was given the promotion of a lifetime,

216
0:10:04.953,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but it came with a price.

217
0:10:06.802,000 --> 0:10:08,000
She was no longer able to pick up her daughter

218
0:10:09.048,000 --> 0:10:1,000
from school every day,

219
0:10:10.261,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and that broke her heart.

220
0:10:12.086,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So she came up with a plan.

221
0:10:13.872,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Every Tuesday and Thursday, Sally left work early,

222
0:10:17.451,000 --> 0:10:18,000
picked up her daughter from school,

223
0:10:19.404,000 --> 0:10:23,000
played with her, fed her, bathed her and put her to bed.

224
0:10:23.821,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And then she went back to the office

225
0:10:25.59,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and worked past midnight to catch up.

226
0:10:28.908,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Only, Sally's rumination journal indicated

227
0:10:31.919,000 --> 0:10:34,000
she spent almost every minute of her quality time with her daughter

228
0:10:35.903,000 --> 0:10:38,000
ruminating about how much work she had to do.

229
0:10:38.942,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Ruminations often deny us our most precious moments.

230
0:10:43.657,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Sally's rumination, "I have so much work to do,"

231
0:10:46.872,000 --> 0:10:47,000
is a very common one.

232
0:10:48.222,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And like all of them,

233
0:10:49.452,000 --> 0:10:5,000
it's useless and it's harmful,

234
0:10:51.388,000 --> 0:10:54,000
because we'd never think it when we're at work, getting stuff done.

235
0:10:55.452,000 --> 0:10:57,000
We think it when we're outside of work,

236
0:10:57.482,000 --> 0:11:,000
when we're trying to relax or do things that we find meaningful,

237
0:11:00.577,000 --> 0:11:01,000
like playing with our children,

238
0:11:02.101,000 --> 0:11:04,000
or having a date night with our partner.

239
0:11:05.038,000 --> 0:11:08,000
To convert a ruminative thought into a productive one,

240
0:11:08.353,000 --> 0:11:11,000
you have to pose it as a problem to be solved.

241
0:11:11.71,000 --> 0:11:14,000
The problem-solving version of "I have so much work to do"

242
0:11:15.083,000 --> 0:11:16,000
is a scheduling question.

243
0:11:16.797,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Like, "Where in my schedule can I fit the tasks that are troubling me?"

244
0:11:20.775,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Or, "What can I move in my schedule to make room for this more urgent thing?"

245
0:11:24.902,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Or even, "When do I have 15 minutes to go over my schedule?"

246
0:11:29.673,000 --> 0:11:32,000
All those are problems that can be solved.

247
0:11:33.109,000 --> 0:11:35,000
"I have so much work to do" is not.

248
0:11:37.276,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Battling rumination is hard,

249
0:11:39.66,000 --> 0:11:41,000
but if you stick to your guardrails,

250
0:11:41.732,000 --> 0:11:44,000
if you ritualize the transition from work to home,

251
0:11:45.224,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and if you train yourself to convert ruminations

252
0:11:47.962,000 --> 0:11:49,000
into productive forms of thinking,

253
0:11:50.119,000 --> 0:11:51,000
you will succeed.

254
0:11:51.95,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Banishing ruminations truly enhanced my personal life,

255
0:11:55.474,000 --> 0:11:57,000
but what it enhanced even more

256
0:11:58.18,000 --> 0:12:01,000
was the joy and satisfaction I get from my work.

257
0:12:02.442,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Ground zero for creating a healthy work-life balance

258
0:12:06.053,000 --> 0:12:07,000
is not in the real world.

259
0:12:08.038,000 --> 0:12:09,000
It's in our head.

260
0:12:09.466,000 --> 0:12:1,000
It's with ruminating.

261
0:12:11.276,000 --> 0:12:14,000
If you want to reduce your stress and improve your quality of life,

262
0:12:15.173,000 --> 0:12:18,000
you don't necessarily have to change your hours or your job.

263
0:12:19.024,000 --> 0:12:21,000
You just have to change how you think.

264
0:12:22.016,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Thank you.

265
0:12:23.191,000 --> 0:12:27,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Planetary systems outside our own

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
but whose streets we can't walk.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
By studying those twinkling lights though,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
we can learn about how stars and planets interact

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to form their own ecosystem

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and make habitats that are amenable to life.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
In this image of the Tokyo skyline,

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I've hidden data

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block,

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
the Kepler Mission.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Can you see it?

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
There we go.

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
This is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at,

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
where it searches for planets

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars,

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
all at once, every half hour,

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and very precisely.

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And what we're looking for

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
is the tiny dimming of light

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us.

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
In just over two years of operations,

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
we've found over 1,200

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
potential new planetary systems around other stars.

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
To give you some perspective,

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
in the previous two decades of searching,

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
we had only known about 400

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
prior to Kepler.

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
When we see these little dips in the light,

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
we can determine a number of things.

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
For one thing, we can determine that there's a planet there,

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but also how big that planet is

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and how far it is away from its parent star.

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
That distance is really important

36
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
because it tells us

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
how much light the planet receives overall.

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And that distance and knowing that amount of light is important

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
because it's a little like you or I sitting around a campfire:

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
You want to be close enough to the campfire so that you're warm,

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
but not so close

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that you're too toasty and you get burned.

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
However, there's more to know about your parent star

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
than just how much light you receive overall.

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And I'll tell you why.

46
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
This is our star. This is our Sun.

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It's shown here in visible light.

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
That's the light that you can see with your own human eyes.

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
You'll notice that it looks pretty much

50
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
like the iconic yellow ball --

51
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that Sun that we all draw when we're children.

52
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But you'll notice something else,

53
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and that's that the face of the Sun

54
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
has freckles.

55
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
These freckles are called sunspots,

56
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and they are just one of the manifestations

57
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
of the Sun's magnetic field.

58
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
They also cause the light from the star to vary.

59
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And we can measure this

60
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
very, very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects.

61
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
However, these are just the tip of the iceberg.

62
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
If we had UV eyes or X-ray eyes,

63
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
we would really see

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the dynamic and dramatic effects

65
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
of our Sun's magnetic activity --

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well.

67
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Just think, even when it's cloudy outside,

68
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
these kind of events are happening

69
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
in the sky above you all the time.

70
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
So when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable,

71
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
whether it might be amenable to life,

72
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
we want to know not only how much total light it receives

73
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and how warm it is,

74
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but we want to know about its space weather --

75
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
this high-energy radiation,

76
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
the UV and the X-rays

77
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that are created by its star

78
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation.

79
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And so, we can't really look

80
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
at planets around other stars

81
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
in the same kind of detail

82
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that we can look at planets in our own solar system.

83
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I'm showing here Venus, Earth and Mars --

84
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size,

85
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
but only one of which

86
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
is really a good place to live.

87
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But what we can do in the meantime

88
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
is measure the light from our stars

89
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and learn about this relationship

90
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
between the planets and their parent stars

91
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to suss out clues

92
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
about which planets might be good places

93
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to look for life in the universe.

94
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Kepler won't find a planet

95
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
around every single star it looks at.

96
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But really, every measurement it makes

97
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
is precious,

98
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
because it's teaching us about the relationship

99
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
between stars and planets,

100
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and how it's really the starlight

101
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that sets the stage

102
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
for the formation of life in the universe.

103
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
While it's Kepler the telescope, the instrument that stares,

104
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
it's we, life, who are searching.

105
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Thank you.

106
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Applause)

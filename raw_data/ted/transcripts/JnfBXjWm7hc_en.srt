1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut,

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
so I decided to follow in the footsteps

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock,

4
0:00:25.82,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and try something new for 30 days.

5
0:00:28.783,000 --> 0:00:29,000
The idea is actually pretty simple.

6
0:00:30.935,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life

7
0:00:33.96,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and try it for the next 30 days.

8
0:00:37.157,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It turns out 30 days is just about the right amount of time

9
0:00:40.575,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to add a new habit or subtract a habit --

10
0:00:43.291,000 --> 0:00:44,000
like watching the news --

11
0:00:44.56,000 --> 0:00:45,000
from your life.

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
There's a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges.

13
0:00:49.882,000 --> 0:00:5,000
The first was,

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
instead of the months flying by, forgotten,

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
the time was much more memorable.

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month.

17
0:01:00.856,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day.

18
0:01:06.392,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I also noticed

19
0:01:07.693,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges,

20
0:01:11.046,000 --> 0:01:12,000
my self-confidence grew.

21
0:01:12.839,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd

22
0:01:14.76,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to the kind of guy who bikes to work.

23
0:01:17.857,000 --> 0:01:18,000
For fun!

24
0:01:19.129,000 --> 0:01:2,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:20.503,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Even last year, I ended up hiking up Mt. Kilimanjaro,

26
0:01:23.55,000 --> 0:01:24,000
the highest mountain in Africa.

27
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges.

28
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I also figured out that if you really want something badly enough,

29
0:01:35.881,000 --> 0:01:37,000
you can do anything for 30 days.

30
0:01:39.365,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Have you ever wanted to write a novel?

31
0:01:42.219,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Every November,

32
0:01:43.534,000 --> 0:01:44,000
tens of thousands of people

33
0:01:44.86,000 --> 0:01:48,000
try to write their own 50,000-word novel, from scratch,

34
0:01:48.965,000 --> 0:01:49,000
in 30 days.

35
0:01:50.923,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It turns out, all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day

36
0:01:55.796,000 --> 0:01:56,000
for a month.

37
0:01:57.833,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So I did.

38
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
By the way, the secret is not to go to sleep

39
0:02:02.145,000 --> 0:02:04,000
until you've written your words for the day.

40
0:02:04.79,000 --> 0:02:05,000
You might be sleep-deprived,

41
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
but you'll finish your novel.

42
0:02:09.029,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Now is my book the next great American novel?

43
0:02:12.707,000 --> 0:02:13,000
No. I wrote it in a month.

44
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It's awful.

45
0:02:16.12,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:17.786,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But for the rest of my life,

47
0:02:19.995,000 --> 0:02:21,000
if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party,

48
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I don't have to say,

49
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
"I'm a computer scientist."

50
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
No, no, if I want to, I can say, "I'm a novelist."

51
0:02:29.623,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:33.009,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So here's one last thing I'd like to mention.

53
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I learned that when I made small, sustainable changes,

54
0:02:38.763,000 --> 0:02:39,000
things I could keep doing,

55
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
they were more likely to stick.

56
0:02:42.507,000 --> 0:02:44,000
There's nothing wrong with big, crazy challenges.

57
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
In fact, they're a ton of fun.

58
0:02:48.088,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But they're less likely to stick.

59
0:02:50.51,000 --> 0:02:52,000
When I gave up sugar for 30 days,

60
0:02:53.102,000 --> 0:02:54,000
day 31 looked like this.

61
0:02:54.941,000 --> 0:02:56,000
(Laughter)

62
0:02:57.269,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So here's my question to you:

63
0:02:59.734,000 --> 0:03:,000
What are you waiting for?

64
0:03:01.493,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I guarantee you the next 30 days

65
0:03:03.795,000 --> 0:03:06,000
are going to pass whether you like it or not,

66
0:03:07.419,000 --> 0:03:11,000
so why not think about something you have always wanted to try

67
0:03:12.142,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and give it a shot!

68
0:03:13.971,000 --> 0:03:14,000
For the next 30 days.

69
0:03:15.916,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Thanks.

70
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Metaphor lives a secret life all around us.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
We utter about six metaphors a minute.

3
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Metaphorical thinking is essential

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
to how we understand ourselves and others,

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
how we communicate, learn, discover

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and invent.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
But metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words.

8
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now, to assist me in explaining this,

9
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I've enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers,

10
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
the reigning king of the metaphorians,

11
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
a man whose contributions to the field

12
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
are so great that he himself

13
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
has become a metaphor.

14
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I am, of course, referring to none other

15
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
than Elvis Presley.

16
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Now, "All Shook Up" is a great love song.

18
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It's also a great example of how

19
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
whenever we deal with anything abstract --

20
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
ideas, emotions, feelings, concepts, thoughts --

21
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
we inevitably resort to metaphor.

22
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
In "All Shook Up," a touch is not a touch, but a chill.

23
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Lips are not lips, but volcanoes.

24
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
She is not she, but a buttercup.

25
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And love is not love, but being all shook up.

26
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
In this, Elvis is following Aristotle's classic definition of metaphor

27
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
as the process of giving the thing

28
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
a name that belongs to something else.

29
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
This is the mathematics of metaphor.

30
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And fortunately it's very simple.

31
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
X equals Y.

32
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
This formula works wherever metaphor is present.

34
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Elvis uses it, but so does Shakespeare

35
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
in this famous line from "Romeo and Juliet:"

36
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Juliet is the sun.

37
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Now, here, Shakespeare gives the thing, Juliet,

38
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
a name that belongs to something else, the sun.

39
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else,

40
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
we give it a whole network of analogies too.

41
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We mix and match what we know about the metaphor's source,

42
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
in this case the sun,

43
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
with what we know about its target, Juliet.

44
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of Juliet

45
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
than if Shakespeare had literally described what she looks like.

46
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So, how do we make and understand metaphors?

47
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
This might look familiar.

48
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
The first step is pattern recognition.

49
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Look at this image. What do you see?

50
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Three wayward Pac-Men,

51
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and three pointy brackets are actually present.

52
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
What we see, however,

53
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
are two overlapping triangles.

54
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Metaphor is not just the detection of patterns;

55
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
it is the creation of patterns.

56
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Second step, conceptual synesthesia.

57
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Now, synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ

58
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in another sense organ as well,

59
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
such as colored hearing.

60
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
People with colored hearing

61
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
actually see colors when they hear the sounds

62
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
of words or letters.

63
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We all have synesthetic abilities.

64
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
This is the Bouba/Kiki test.

65
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
What you have to do is identify which of these shapes

66
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
is called Bouba, and which is called Kiki.

67
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
If you are like 98 percent of other people,

69
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
you will identify the round, amoeboid shape as Bouba,

70
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and the sharp, spiky one as Kiki.

71
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Can we do a quick show of hands?

72
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Does that correspond?

73
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Okay, I think 99.9 would about cover it.

74
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Why do we do that?

75
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Because we instinctively find, or create,

76
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
a pattern between the round shape

77
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and the round sound of Bouba,

78
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
and the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki.

79
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic.

80
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Silence is sweet.

81
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Neckties are loud.

82
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Sexually attractive people are hot.

83
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Sexually unattractive people leave us cold.

84
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia,

85
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
in which we understand one concept

86
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
in the context of another.

87
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Third step is cognitive dissonance.

88
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
This is the Stroop test.

89
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
What you need to do here is identify

90
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
as quickly as possible

91
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the color of the ink in which these words are printed.

92
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
You can take the test now.

93
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
If you're like most people, you will experience

94
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
a moment of cognitive dissonance

95
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
when the name of the color

96
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
is printed in a differently colored ink.

97
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words

98
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
even when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer.

99
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well.

100
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
The participants had to identify, as quickly as possible,

101
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
the literally false sentences.

102
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
They took longer to reject metaphors as false

103
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
than they did to reject literally false sentences.

104
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Why? Because we cannot ignore

105
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
the metaphorical meaning of words either.

106
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
One of the sentences was, "Some jobs are jails."

107
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Now, unless you're a prison guard,

108
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
the sentence "Some jobs are jails" is literally false.

109
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Sadly, it's metaphorically true.

110
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability

111
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to identify it as literally false.

112
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Metaphor matters because

113
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
it's around us every day, all the time.

114
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Metaphor matters because it creates expectations.

115
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news.

116
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Agent metaphors describe price movements

117
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
as the deliberate action of a living thing,

118
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
as in, "The NASDAQ climbed higher."

119
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Object metaphors describe price movements

120
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
as non-living things,

121
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
as in, "The Dow fell like a brick."

122
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Researchers asked a group of people

123
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
to read a clutch of market commentaries,

124
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and then predict the next day's price trend.

125
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Those exposed to agent metaphors

126
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
had higher expectations that price trends would continue.

127
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And they had those expectations because

128
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
agent metaphors imply the deliberate action

129
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
of a living thing pursuing a goal.

130
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
If, for example, house prices

131
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
are routinely described as climbing and climbing,

132
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
higher and higher, people might naturally assume

133
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that that rise is unstoppable.

134
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
They may feel confident, say,

135
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
in taking out mortgages they really can't afford.

136
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
That's a hypothetical example of course.

137
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
But this is how metaphor misleads.

138
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Metaphor also matters because it influences decisions

139
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
by activating analogies.

140
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
A group of students was told that a small democratic country

141
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
had been invaded and had asked the U.S. for help.

142
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And they had to make a decision.

143
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
What should they do?

144
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Intervene, appeal to the U.N., or do nothing?

145
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
They were each then given one of three

146
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
descriptions of this hypothetical crisis.

147
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Each of which was designed to trigger

148
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
a different historical analogy:

149
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
World War II, Vietnam,

150
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and the third was historically neutral.

151
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Those exposed to the World War II scenario

152
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
made more interventionist recommendations

153
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
than the others.

154
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words,

155
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
we cannot ignore the analogies

156
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that are triggered by metaphor.

157
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery.

158
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Whenever we solve a problem, or make a discovery,

159
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
we compare what we know with what we don't know.

160
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And the only way to find out about the latter

161
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
is to investigate the ways it might be like the former.

162
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Einstein described his scientific method as combinatory play.

163
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
He famously used thought experiments,

164
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
which are essentially elaborate analogies,

165
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
to come up with some of his greatest discoveries.

166
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
By bringing together what we know

167
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and what we don't know through analogy,

168
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
metaphorical thinking strikes the spark

169
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that ignites discovery.

170
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Now metaphor is ubiquitous, yet it's hidden.

171
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
But you just have to look at the words around you

172
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and you'll find it.

173
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Ralph Waldo Emerson described language

174
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
as "fossil poetry."

175
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
But before it was fossil poetry

176
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
language was fossil metaphor.

177
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And these fossils still breathe.

178
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Take the three most famous words in all of Western philosophy:

179
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
"Cogito ergo sum."

180
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
That's routinely translated as, "I think, therefore I am."

181
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But there is a better translation.

182
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
The Latin word "cogito"

183
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
is derived from the prefix "co," meaning "together,"

184
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and the verb "agitare," meaning "to shake."

185
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So, the original meaning of "cogito"

186
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
is to shake together.

187
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And the proper translation of "cogito ergo sum"

188
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
is "I shake things up, therefore I am."

189
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Laughter)

190
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
Metaphor shakes things up,

191
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
giving us everything from Shakespeare to scientific discovery in the process.

192
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The mind is a plastic snow dome,

193
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
the most beautiful, most interesting,

194
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and most itself, when, as Elvis put it,

195
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
it's all shook up.

196
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And metaphor keeps the mind shaking,

197
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
rattling and rolling, long after Elvis has left the building.

198
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Thank you very much.

199
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(Applause)

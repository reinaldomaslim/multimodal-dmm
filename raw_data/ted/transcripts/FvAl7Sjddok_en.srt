0:00:12,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'd like to begin this song I wrote

2
0:00:15,000 --> 0:00:2,000
about ceaseless yearning and never-ending want

3
0:00:2,000 --> 0:00:25,000
with a poem of popular Petrarchan paradoxes

4
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
by Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder:

5
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:33,000
"I find no peace, and all my war is done;

6
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I fear and hope, I burn and freeze like ice;

7
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I fly above the wind,

8
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and yet I cannot arise;

9
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And naught I have,

10
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and all the world I seize upon."

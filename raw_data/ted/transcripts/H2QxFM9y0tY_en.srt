0:00:13.341,000 --> 0:00:15,000
When I was about eight years old,

3
0:00:16.308,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I first heard about something called climate change or global warming.

4
0:00:21.619,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Apparently, that was something humans had created by our way of living.

5
0:00:27.222,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I was told to turn off the lights to save energy

6
0:00:31.088,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and to recycle paper to save resources.

7
0:00:36.268,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I remember thinking that it was very strange

8
0:00:39.309,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that humans, who are an animal species among others,

9
0:00:43.019,000 --> 0:00:47,000
could be capable of changing the Earth's climate.

10
0:00:48.09,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Because if we were, and if it was really happening,

11
0:00:51.836,000 --> 0:00:53,000
we wouldn't be talking about anything else.

12
0:00:55.72,000 --> 0:00:59,000
As soon as you'd turn on the TV, everything would be about that.

13
0:01:00.508,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Headlines, radio, newspapers,

14
0:01:03.849,000 --> 0:01:05,000
you would never read or hear about anything else,

15
0:01:07.18,000 --> 0:01:09,000
as if there was a world war going on.

16
0:01:10.838,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But no one ever talked about it.

17
0:01:14.13,000 --> 0:01:2,000
If burning fossil fuels was so bad that it threatened our very existence,

18
0:01:20.649,000 --> 0:01:22,000
how could we just continue like before?

19
0:01:24.263,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Why were there no restrictions?

20
0:01:27.03,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Why wasn't it made illegal?

21
0:01:30.921,000 --> 0:01:32,000
To me, that did not add up.

22
0:01:34.288,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It was too unreal.

23
0:01:38.401,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So when I was 11, I became ill.

24
0:01:41.25,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I fell into depression,

25
0:01:43.319,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I stopped talking,

26
0:01:44.998,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and I stopped eating.

27
0:01:47.699,000 --> 0:01:5,000
In two months, I lost about 10 kilos of weight.

28
0:01:52.889,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Later on, I was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome,

29
0:01:56.319,000 --> 0:01:58,000
OCD and selective mutism.

30
0:02:00.189,000 --> 0:02:03,000
That basically means I only speak when I think it's necessary -

31
0:02:03.76,000 --> 0:02:04,000
now is one of those moments.

32
0:02:05.67,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Applause)

33
0:02:15.908,000 --> 0:02:17,000
For those of us who are on the spectrum,

34
0:02:18.29,000 --> 0:02:2,000
almost everything is black or white.

35
0:02:21.564,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We aren't very good at lying,

36
0:02:23.234,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and we usually don't enjoy participating in this social game

37
0:02:26.598,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that the rest of you seem so fond of.

38
0:02:29.153,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:30.688,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I think in many ways that we autistic are the normal ones,

40
0:02:34.041,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and the rest of the people are pretty strange,

41
0:02:36.368,000 --> 0:02:37,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:37.561,000 --> 0:02:39,000
especially when it comes to the sustainability crisis,

43
0:02:40.8,000 --> 0:02:43,000
where everyone keeps saying climate change is an existential threat

44
0:02:44.925,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and the most important issue of all,

45
0:02:47.534,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and yet they just carry on like before.

46
0:02:51.631,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I don't understand that,

47
0:02:53.699,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because if the emissions have to stop,

48
0:02:56.447,000 --> 0:02:58,000
then we must stop the emissions.

49
0:02:59.194,000 --> 0:03:,000
To me that is black or white.

50
0:03:01.698,000 --> 0:03:03,000
There are no gray areas when it comes to survival.

51
0:03:04.83,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Either we go on as a civilization or we don't.

52
0:03:08.646,000 --> 0:03:1,000
We have to change.

53
0:03:12.016,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Rich countries like Sweden need to start reducing emissions

54
0:03:15.95,000 --> 0:03:18,000
by at least 15 percent every year.

55
0:03:20.199,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And that is so that we can stay below a two-degree warming target.

56
0:03:24.821,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Yet, as the IPCC have recently demonstrated,

57
0:03:29.25,000 --> 0:03:31,000
aiming instead for 1.5 degrees Celsius

58
0:03:32.362,000 --> 0:03:34,000
would significantly reduce the climate impacts.

59
0:03:35.928,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But we can only imagine what that means for reducing emissions.

60
0:03:40.897,000 --> 0:03:42,000
You would think the media and every one of our leaders

61
0:03:43.607,000 --> 0:03:45,000
would be talking about nothing else,

62
0:03:45.897,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but they never even mention it.

63
0:03:49.004,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Nor does anyone ever mention

64
0:03:50.739,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the greenhouse gases already locked in the system.

65
0:03:54.34,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Nor that air pollution is hiding a warming

66
0:03:57.455,000 --> 0:03:59,000
so that when we stop burning fossil fuels,

67
0:04:00.416,000 --> 0:04:02,000
we already have an extra level of warming

68
0:04:02.864,000 --> 0:04:06,000
perhaps as high as 0.5 to 1.1 degrees Celsius.

69
0:04:09.072,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Furthermore does hardly anyone speak about the fact

70
0:04:11.624,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction,

71
0:04:15.765,000 --> 0:04:19,000
with up to 200 species going extinct every single day,

72
0:04:22.178,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that the extinction rate today

73
0:04:25.819,000 --> 0:04:28,000
is between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher

74
0:04:29.619,000 --> 0:04:31,000
than what is seen as normal.

75
0:04:34.516,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Nor does hardly anyone ever speak about the aspect of equity or climate justice,

76
0:04:40.25,000 --> 0:04:42,000
clearly stated everywhere in the Paris Agreement,

77
0:04:43.614,000 --> 0:04:47,000
which is absolutely necessary to make it work on a global scale.

78
0:04:49.486,000 --> 0:04:5,000
That means that rich countries

79
0:04:51.342,000 --> 0:04:54,000
need to get down to zero emissions within 6 to 12 years,

80
0:04:56.065,000 --> 0:04:58,000
with today's emission speed.

81
0:05:00.19,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And that is so that people in poorer countries

82
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
can have a chance to heighten their standard of living

83
0:05:04.99,000 --> 0:05:07,000
by building some of the infrastructure that we have already built,

84
0:05:08.863,000 --> 0:05:11,000
such as roads, schools, hospitals,

85
0:05:11.911,000 --> 0:05:14,000
clean drinking water, electricity, and so on.

86
0:05:15.707,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Because how can we expect countries like India or Nigeria

87
0:05:20.303,000 --> 0:05:21,000
to care about the climate crisis

88
0:05:22.185,000 --> 0:05:27,000
if we who already have everything don't care even a second about it

89
0:05:27.19,000 --> 0:05:29,000
or our actual commitments to the Paris Agreement?

90
0:05:32.449,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So, why are we not reducing our emissions?

91
0:05:37.611,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Why are they in fact still increasing?

92
0:05:41.82,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Are we knowingly causing a mass extinction?

93
0:05:45.738,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Are we evil?

94
0:05:49.118,000 --> 0:05:51,000
No, of course not.

95
0:05:51.7,000 --> 0:05:52,000
People keep doing what they do

96
0:05:53.329,000 --> 0:05:55,000
because the vast majority doesn't have a clue

97
0:05:55.969,000 --> 0:05:58,000
about the actual consequences of our everyday life,

98
0:06:00.474,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and they don't know that rapid change is required.

99
0:06:04.48,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We all think we know, and we all think everybody knows,

100
0:06:08.447,000 --> 0:06:09,000
but we don't.

101
0:06:10.708,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Because how could we?

102
0:06:14.474,000 --> 0:06:15,000
If there really was a crisis,

103
0:06:16.696,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and if this crisis was caused by our emissions,

104
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:22,000
you would at least see some signs.

105
0:06:23.048,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Not just flooded cities, tens of thousands of dead people,

106
0:06:27.166,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and whole nations leveled to piles of torn down buildings.

107
0:06:31.904,000 --> 0:06:33,000
You would see some restrictions.

108
0:06:34.616,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But no.

109
0:06:36.774,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And no one talks about it.

110
0:06:40.359,000 --> 0:06:45,000
There are no emergency meetings, no headlines, no breaking news.

111
0:06:46.659,000 --> 0:06:48,000
No one is acting as if we were in a crisis.

112
0:06:50.309,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Even most climate scientists or green politicians

113
0:06:54.399,000 --> 0:06:57,000
keep on flying around the world, eating meat and dairy.

114
0:07:02.267,000 --> 0:07:07,000
If I live to be 100, I will be alive in the year 2103.

115
0:07:09.738,000 --> 0:07:14,000
When you think about the future today, you don't think beyond the year 2050.

116
0:07:16.178,000 --> 0:07:2,000
By then, I will, in the best case, not even have lived half of my life.

117
0:07:22.319,000 --> 0:07:23,000
What happens next?

118
0:07:25.559,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The year 2078, I will celebrate my 75th birthday.

119
0:07:32.45,000 --> 0:07:37,000
If I have children or grandchildren, maybe they will spend that day with me.

120
0:07:38.682,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Maybe they will ask me about you,

121
0:07:41.384,000 --> 0:07:44,000
the people who were around, back in 2018.

122
0:07:46.786,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Maybe they will ask why you didn't do anything

123
0:07:49.83,000 --> 0:07:51,000
while there still was time to act.

124
0:07:53.89,000 --> 0:07:57,000
What we do or don't do right now will affect my entire life

125
0:07:58.268,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and the lives of my children and grandchildren.

126
0:08:01.96,000 --> 0:08:03,000
What we do or don't do right now,

127
0:08:04.562,000 --> 0:08:08,000
me and my generation can't undo in the future.

128
0:08:12.169,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So when school started in August of this year,

129
0:08:15.034,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I decided that this was enough.

130
0:08:18.083,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I set myself down on the ground outside the Swedish parliament.

131
0:08:22.51,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I school striked for the climate.

132
0:08:26.677,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Some people say that I should be in school instead.

133
0:08:30.269,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Some people say that I should study to become a climate scientist

134
0:08:33.929,000 --> 0:08:36,000
so that I can "solve the climate crisis."

135
0:08:38.868,000 --> 0:08:4,000
But the climate crisis has already been solved.

136
0:08:42.4,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We already have all the facts and solutions.

137
0:08:45.92,000 --> 0:08:47,000
All we have to do is to wake up and change.

138
0:08:50.1,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And why should I be studying for a future that soon will be no more

139
0:08:54.839,000 --> 0:08:57,000
when no one is doing anything whatsoever to save that future?

140
0:08:59.859,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And what is the point of learning facts in the school system

141
0:09:03.943,000 --> 0:09:04,000
when the most important facts

142
0:09:05.902,000 --> 0:09:08,000
given by the finest science of that same school system

143
0:09:09.62,000 --> 0:09:13,000
clearly means nothing to our politicians and our society.

144
0:09:15.588,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Some people say that Sweden is just a small country,

145
0:09:18.869,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and that it doesn't matter what we do,

146
0:09:21.901,000 --> 0:09:25,000
but I think that if a few children can get headlines all over the world

147
0:09:26.179,000 --> 0:09:28,000
just by not coming to school for a few weeks,

148
0:09:29.077,000 --> 0:09:32,000
imagine what we could all do together if you wanted to.

149
0:09:32.108,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Applause)

150
0:09:36.5,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Now we're almost at the end of my talk,

151
0:09:41.089,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and this is where people usually start talking about hope,

152
0:09:46.96,000 --> 0:09:5,000
solar panels, wind power, circular economy, and so on,

153
0:09:52.38,000 --> 0:09:54,000
but I'm not going to do that.

154
0:09:54.751,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We've had 30 years of pep-talking and selling positive ideas.

155
0:09:59.912,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And I'm sorry, but it doesn't work.

156
0:10:02.909,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Because if it would have,

157
0:10:04.521,000 --> 0:10:06,000
the emissions would have gone down by now.

158
0:10:06.779,000 --> 0:10:07,000
They haven't.

159
0:10:09.472,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And yes, we do need hope,

160
0:10:12.58,000 --> 0:10:13,000
of course we do.

161
0:10:14.649,000 --> 0:10:17,000
But the one thing we need more than hope is action.

162
0:10:19.04,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Once we start to act, hope is everywhere.

163
0:10:23.72,000 --> 0:10:25,000
So instead of looking for hope,

164
0:10:25.96,000 --> 0:10:26,000
look for action.

165
0:10:28.51,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Then, and only then, hope will come.

166
0:10:34.561,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Today, we use 100 million barrels of oil every single day.

167
0:10:41.97,000 --> 0:10:43,000
There are no politics to change that.

168
0:10:45.148,000 --> 0:10:47,000
There are no rules to keep that oil in the ground.

169
0:10:49.358,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So we can't save the world by playing by the rules,

170
0:10:52.99,000 --> 0:10:54,000
because the rules have to be changed.

171
0:10:56.199,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Everything needs to change --

172
0:10:58.676,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and it has to start today.

173
0:11:01.009,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Thank you.

174
0:11:02.148,000 --> 0:11:05,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:16,000
It has been 128 years

2
0:00:16.84,000 --> 0:00:19,000
since the last country in the world abolished slavery

3
0:00:21.24,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and 53 years

4
0:00:23.68,000 --> 0:00:28,000
since Martin Luther King pronounced his "I Have A Dream" speech.

5
0:00:29.8,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But we still live in a world

6
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:37,000
where the color of our skin not only gives a first impression,

7
0:00:37.88,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but a lasting one that remains.

8
0:00:43.12,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I was born in a family full of colors.

9
0:00:47.4,000 --> 0:00:5,000
My father is the son of a maid

10
0:00:50.44,000 --> 0:00:55,000
from whom he inherited an intense dark chocolate tone.

11
0:00:56.28,000 --> 0:01:,000
He was adopted by those who I know as my grandparents.

12
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:03,000
The matriarch, my grandma,

13
0:01:03.28,000 --> 0:01:06,000
has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair.

14
0:01:07.56,000 --> 0:01:12,000
My grandpa was somewhere between a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone,

15
0:01:13.32,000 --> 0:01:15,000
like my uncle and my cousin.

16
0:01:16.68,000 --> 0:01:22,000
My mother is a cinnamon-skin daughter of a native Brazilian,

17
0:01:23.56,000 --> 0:01:25,000
with a pinch of hazel and honey,

18
0:01:26.92,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and a man [who is] a mix of coffee with milk,

19
0:01:29.88,000 --> 0:01:3,000
but with a lot of coffee.

20
0:01:32.4,000 --> 0:01:34,000
She has two sisters.

21
0:01:34.68,000 --> 0:01:36,000
One in a toasted-peanut skin

22
0:01:37.6,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and the other,

23
0:01:39.04,000 --> 0:01:4,000
also adopted,

24
0:01:40.6,000 --> 0:01:41,000
more on the beige side,

25
0:01:42.52,000 --> 0:01:43,000
like a pancake.

26
0:01:43.84,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:45.24,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Growing up in this family,

28
0:01:48.12,000 --> 0:01:5,000
color was never important for me.

29
0:01:51.6,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Outside home, however, things were different soon.

30
0:01:57.56,000 --> 0:02:,000
Color had many other meanings.

31
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I remember my first drawing lessons in school

32
0:02:05.96,000 --> 0:02:07,000
as a bunch of contradictory feelings.

33
0:02:08.92,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It was exciting and creative

34
0:02:11.88,000 --> 0:02:15,000
but I never understood the unique flesh-colored pencil.

35
0:02:17.36,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I was made of flesh but I wasn't pink.

36
0:02:20.759,000 --> 0:02:23,000
My skin was brown, and people said I was black.

37
0:02:24.56,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I was seven years old with a mess of colors in my head.

38
0:02:29.96,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Later,

39
0:02:31.88,000 --> 0:02:33,000
when I took my cousin to school,

40
0:02:34.4,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I was usually taken for the nanny.

41
0:02:37.32,000 --> 0:02:4,000
By helping in the kitchen at a friend's party,

42
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:43,000
people thought I was the maid.

43
0:02:43.68,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I was even treated like a prostitute

44
0:02:46.72,000 --> 0:02:5,000
just because I was walking alone on the beach with European friends.

45
0:02:51.76,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And many times,

46
0:02:53.28,000 --> 0:02:57,000
visiting my grandma or friends in upper class buildings,

47
0:02:57.88,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I was invited not to use the main elevator.

48
0:03:02.84,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Because in the end,

49
0:03:05.24,000 --> 0:03:07,000
with this color and this hair,

50
0:03:07.96,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I cannot belong to some places.

51
0:03:12.4,000 --> 0:03:13,000
In some way,

52
0:03:13.64,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I get to used to it and accept part of it.

53
0:03:17.2,000 --> 0:03:21,000
However, something inside of me keeps revolving and struggling.

54
0:03:23.2,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Years later I married a Spaniard.

55
0:03:27.44,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But not any Spaniard.

56
0:03:29.64,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I chose one with the skin color of a lobster when sunburnt.

57
0:03:33.56,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:35.6,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Since then, a new question started to chase me.

59
0:03:39.96,000 --> 0:03:41,000
What will be the color of your children?

60
0:03:43.04,000 --> 0:03:45,000
As you can understand, this is my last concern.

61
0:03:46.28,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But thinking about it,

62
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:5,000
with my previous background,

63
0:03:50.96,000 --> 0:03:56,000
my story led me to make my personal exercise as a photographer.

64
0:03:57.08,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And that is how Humanae was born.

65
0:04:00.64,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Humanae is a pursuit to highlight our true colors,

66
0:04:05.6,000 --> 0:04:06,000
rather than the untrue

67
0:04:07.28,000 --> 0:04:12,000
white, red, black or yellow associated with race.

68
0:04:12.72,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It's a kind of game to question our codes.

69
0:04:17.08,000 --> 0:04:22,000
It's a work in progress from a personal story to a global history.

70
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I portray the subjects in a white background.

71
0:04:27.88,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Then I choose an 11-pixel square from the nose,

72
0:04:32.8,000 --> 0:04:33,000
paint the background,

73
0:04:35.2,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and look for the corresponding color in the industrial palette, Pantone.

74
0:04:40.48,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I started with my family and friends,

75
0:04:43.48,000 --> 0:04:46,000
then more and more people joined the adventure,

76
0:04:47.4,000 --> 0:04:5,000
thanks to public calls coming through the social media.

77
0:04:52.44,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I thought that the main space to show my work was the Internet

78
0:04:57.04,000 --> 0:05:01,000
because I want an open concept that invites everybody

79
0:05:01.6,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to push the share button in both the computer and their brain.

80
0:05:08.28,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The snowball started to roll.

81
0:05:11.88,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The project had a great welcome --

82
0:05:15.76,000 --> 0:05:18,000
invitations, exhibitions,

83
0:05:19.24,000 --> 0:05:2,000
physical formats,

84
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:23,000
galleries and museums ...

85
0:05:23.8,000 --> 0:05:24,000
just happened.

86
0:05:25.56,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And among them, my favorite:

87
0:05:29.24,000 --> 0:05:32,000
when Humanae occupies public spaces

88
0:05:33.28,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and appears in the street,

89
0:05:36.44,000 --> 0:05:38,000
it fosters a popular debate

90
0:05:39.84,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and creates a feeling of community.

91
0:05:46.8,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I have portrayed more than 3,000 people

92
0:05:50.92,000 --> 0:05:52,000
in 13 different countries,

93
0:05:53.56,000 --> 0:05:56,000
19 different cities around the world.

94
0:05:56.64,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Just to mention some of them --

95
0:05:59.2,000 --> 0:06:01,000
from someone included in the Forbes list,

96
0:06:01.76,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to refugees who crossed the Mediterranean by boat.

97
0:06:05.24,000 --> 0:06:09,000
In Paris, from the UNESCO Headquarters to a shelter.

98
0:06:09.68,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And students both in Switzerland and favelas in Rio de Janeiro.

99
0:06:15.36,000 --> 0:06:16,000
All kinds of beliefs,

100
0:06:17.36,000 --> 0:06:18,000
gender identities

101
0:06:18.92,000 --> 0:06:19,000
or physical impairments,

102
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
a newborn or terminally ill.

103
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
We all together build Humanae.

104
0:06:29.04,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Those portraits make us rethink how we see each other.

105
0:06:34.12,000 --> 0:06:37,000
When modern science is questioning the race concept,

106
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:43,000
what does it mean for us to be black, white, yellow, red?

107
0:06:44.56,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Is it the eye, the nose, the mouth, the hair?

108
0:06:49.72,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Or does it have to do with our origin,

109
0:06:53.08,000 --> 0:06:54,000
nationality

110
0:06:54.36,000 --> 0:06:55,000
or bank account?

111
0:06:58.88,000 --> 0:07:02,000
This personal exercise turned out to be a discovery.

112
0:07:03.64,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Suddenly I realized that Humanae was useful for many people.

113
0:07:09.88,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It represents a sort of mirror

114
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
for those who cannot find themselves reflected in any label.

115
0:07:17.32,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It was amazing

116
0:07:18.64,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me.

117
0:07:23.08,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I have hundreds of that,

118
0:07:25.08,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I will share with you, too.

119
0:07:27.88,000 --> 0:07:29,000
A mother of 11 years --

120
0:07:30.76,000 --> 0:07:33,000
A mother of an 11-year-old girl wrote me,

121
0:07:35.08,000 --> 0:07:38,000
"Very good for me as a tool to work on her confidence,

122
0:07:38.88,000 --> 0:07:4,000
as this past weekend

123
0:07:40.96,000 --> 0:07:44,000
one of her girlfriends argued with her that she does not belong

124
0:07:45.92,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and should not be allowed to live in Norway.

125
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So your work has a very special place in my heart

126
0:07:53.96,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and it's very important for me."

127
0:07:58.88,000 --> 0:08:01,000
A woman shared her portrait on Facebook and wrote,

128
0:08:03.64,000 --> 0:08:04,000
"All my life,

129
0:08:04.88,000 --> 0:08:09,000
people from across the globe had difficulties to place me in a group,

130
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:11,000
a stereotype,

131
0:08:11.48,000 --> 0:08:12,000
a box.

132
0:08:12.8,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Perhaps we should stop.

133
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Instead of framing, ask the individual,

134
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
'How would you label yourself?'

135
0:08:20.48,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Then I would say,

136
0:08:22.32,000 --> 0:08:24,000
'Hi. I'm Massiel.

137
0:08:24.36,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I'm a Dominican-Dutch,

138
0:08:25.92,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I grew up in a mixed family

139
0:08:27.96,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and I'm a bisexual woman.' "

140
0:08:31.88,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Besides these unexpected and touching reactions,

141
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Humanae finds a new life in a different variety of fields.

142
0:08:40.68,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Just to show you some examples,

143
0:08:43.68,000 --> 0:08:45,000
illustrators and art students

144
0:08:45.919,000 --> 0:08:49,000
using it as a reference for their sketches and their studies.

145
0:08:50.039,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It's a collection of faces.

146
0:08:52.84,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Researchers in the fields of anthropology,

147
0:08:56.8,000 --> 0:08:58,000
physics and neuroscience

148
0:08:59.12,000 --> 0:09:03,000
use Humanae with different scientific approaches

149
0:09:03.28,000 --> 0:09:05,000
related to human ethnicity,

150
0:09:05.92,000 --> 0:09:06,000
optophysiology,

151
0:09:07.68,000 --> 0:09:08,000
face recognition

152
0:09:09.44,000 --> 0:09:1,000
or Alzheimer's.

153
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:15,000
One of the most important impacts of the project

154
0:09:15.44,000 --> 0:09:19,000
is that Humanae was chosen to be the cover of Foreign Affairs,

155
0:09:20.12,000 --> 0:09:24,000
one of the most relevant political publications.

156
0:09:24.76,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And talking about foreign affairs,

157
0:09:28.28,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I found the perfect ambassadors for my project ...

158
0:09:32.68,000 --> 0:09:33,000
teachers.

159
0:09:33.92,000 --> 0:09:38,000
They are the ones that use Humanae as a tool for educational purposes.

160
0:09:40.88,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Their passion encourages me to go back to drawing classes,

161
0:09:46.36,000 --> 0:09:48,000
but this time as a teacher myself.

162
0:09:50.2,000 --> 0:09:51,000
My students,

163
0:09:51.68,000 --> 0:09:53,000
both adults and kids,

164
0:09:53.96,000 --> 0:09:55,000
paint their self-portraits,

165
0:09:56.76,000 --> 0:10:,000
trying to discover their own unique color.

166
0:10:08.72,000 --> 0:10:1,000
As a photographer,

167
0:10:10.76,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I realize that I can be a channel for others to communicate.

168
0:10:17.04,000 --> 0:10:18,000
As an individual,

169
0:10:18.88,000 --> 0:10:19,000
as Angélica,

170
0:10:21.08,000 --> 0:10:24,000
every time I take a picture,

171
0:10:24.28,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I feel that I am sitting in front of a therapist.

172
0:10:29.48,000 --> 0:10:33,000
All the frustration, fear and loneliness

173
0:10:34.44,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that I once felt ...

174
0:10:36.36,000 --> 0:10:37,000
becomes love.

175
0:10:41.4,000 --> 0:10:42,000
The last country --

176
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:49,000
the last country in the world who abolished slavery

177
0:10:49.04,000 --> 0:10:51,000
is the country where I was born,

178
0:10:51.92,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Brazil.

179
0:10:54.44,000 --> 0:10:58,000
We still have to work hard to abolish discrimination.

180
0:11:00.08,000 --> 0:11:03,000
That remains a common practice worldwide,

181
0:11:04.08,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and that will not disappear by itself.

182
0:11:08.48,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Thank you.

183
0:11:09.76,000 --> 0:11:23,000
(Applause)

184
0:11:23.88,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Thank you.

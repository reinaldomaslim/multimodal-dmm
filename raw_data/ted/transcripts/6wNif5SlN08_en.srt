1
0:00:12.764,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I remember when I first found out

2
0:00:14.686,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I was going to speak at a TED conference.

3
0:00:16.749,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I ran across the hall to one of my classrooms

4
0:00:18.884,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to inform my students.

5
0:00:20.337,000 --> 0:00:21,000
"Guess what, guys?

6
0:00:21.609,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I've been asked to give a TED Talk."

7
0:00:23.711,000 --> 0:00:25,000
The reaction wasn't one I quite expected.

8
0:00:25.766,000 --> 0:00:26,000
The whole room went silent.

9
0:00:28.954,000 --> 0:00:3,000
"A TED Talk? You mean, like the one you made us watch on grit?

10
0:00:31.938,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Or the one with the scientist that did this really awesome thing with robots?"

11
0:00:35.657,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Muhammad asked.

12
0:00:36.847,000 --> 0:00:37,000
"Yes, just like that."

13
0:00:38.957,000 --> 0:00:4,000
"But Coach, those people are really important and smart."

14
0:00:41.915,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:44.016,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"I know that."

16
0:00:46.613,000 --> 0:00:49,000
"But Coach, why are you speaking? You hate public speaking."

17
0:00:50.891,000 --> 0:00:51,000
"I do," I admitted,

18
0:00:54.154,000 --> 0:00:57,000
"But it's important that I speak about us, that I speak about your journeys,

19
0:00:57.777,000 --> 0:00:58,000
about my journey.

20
0:00:58.96,000 --> 0:00:59,000
People need to know."

21
0:01:00.918,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The students at the all-refugee school that I founded

22
0:01:03.655,000 --> 0:01:05,000
decided to end with some words of encouragement.

23
0:01:06.071,000 --> 0:01:07,000
"Cool! It better be good, Coach."

24
0:01:07.914,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:10.638,000 --> 0:01:13,000
There are 65.3 million people who have been forcibly displaced

26
0:01:14.22,000 --> 0:01:16,000
from their homes because of war or persecution.

27
0:01:17.855,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The largest number, 11 million, are from Syria.

28
0:01:21.783,000 --> 0:01:25,000
33,952 people flee their homes daily.

29
0:01:28.666,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The vast majority remain in refugee camps,

30
0:01:31.888,000 --> 0:01:35,000
whose conditions cannot be defined as humane under anyone's definition.

31
0:01:36.506,000 --> 0:01:4,000
We are participating in the degradation of humans.

32
0:01:44.57,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Never have we had numbers this high.

33
0:01:46.375,000 --> 0:01:49,000
This is the highest number of refugees since World War II.

34
0:01:50.235,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Now, let me tell you why this issue is so important to me.

35
0:01:53.964,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I am an Arab. I am an immigrant.

36
0:01:57.844,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I am a Muslim.

37
0:01:59.826,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I've also spent the last 12 years of my life working with refugees.

38
0:02:03.624,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Oh -- and I'm also gay.

39
0:02:05.09,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It makes me really popular these days.

40
0:02:07.014,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:08.929,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But I am the daughter of a refugee.

42
0:02:11.876,000 --> 0:02:15,000
My grandmother fled Syria in 1964 during the first Assad regime.

43
0:02:16.398,000 --> 0:02:19,000
She was three months pregnant when she packed up a suitcase,

44
0:02:19.869,000 --> 0:02:22,000
piled in her five children and drove to neighboring Jordan,

45
0:02:22.987,000 --> 0:02:25,000
not knowing what the future held for her and her family.

46
0:02:26.023,000 --> 0:02:29,000
My grandfather decided to stay, not believing it was that bad.

47
0:02:30.382,000 --> 0:02:33,000
He followed her a month later, after his brothers were tortured

48
0:02:33.88,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and his factory was taken over by the government.

49
0:02:36.859,000 --> 0:02:38,000
They rebuilt their lives starting from scratch

50
0:02:39.077,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and eventually became independently wealthy Jordanian citizens.

51
0:02:43.789,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I was born in Jordan 11 years later.

52
0:02:47.251,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It was really important to my grandmother for us to know our history

53
0:02:50.585,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and our journey.

54
0:02:52.703,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I was eight years old when she took me to visit my first refugee camp.

55
0:02:56.344,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I didn't understand why.

56
0:02:58.456,000 --> 0:03:,000
I didn't know why it was so important to her

57
0:03:00.611,000 --> 0:03:01,000
for us to go.

58
0:03:02.085,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I remember walking into the camp holding her hand,

59
0:03:05.048,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and her saying, "Go play with the kids,"

60
0:03:07.041,000 --> 0:03:09,000
while she visited with the women in the camp.

61
0:03:10.426,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I didn't want to.

62
0:03:11.662,000 --> 0:03:12,000
These kids weren't like me.

63
0:03:13.102,000 --> 0:03:14,000
They were poor. They lived in a camp.

64
0:03:14.904,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I refused.

65
0:03:16.268,000 --> 0:03:18,000
She knelt down beside me and firmly said, "Go.

66
0:03:19.258,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And don't come back until you've played.

67
0:03:21.436,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Don't ever think people are beneath you

68
0:03:23.5,000 --> 0:03:25,000
or that you have nothing to learn from others."

69
0:03:26.34,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I reluctantly went.

70
0:03:27.813,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I never wanted to disappoint my grandmother.

71
0:03:31.295,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I returned a few hours later,

72
0:03:32.716,000 --> 0:03:36,000
having spent some time playing soccer with the kids in the camp.

73
0:03:37.859,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We walked out of the camp,

74
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and I was excitedly telling her what a great time I had

75
0:03:41.879,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and how fantastic the kids were.

76
0:03:44.995,000 --> 0:03:46,000
"Haram!" I said in Arabic. "Poor them."

77
0:03:48.468,000 --> 0:03:51,000
"Haram on us," she said, using the word's different meaning,

78
0:03:51.579,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that we were sinning.

79
0:03:53.822,000 --> 0:03:55,000
"Don't feel sorry for them; believe in them."

80
0:03:58.171,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It wasn't until I left my country of origin for the United States

81
0:04:01.614,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that I realized the impact of her words.

82
0:04:05.007,000 --> 0:04:08,000
After my college graduation, I applied for and was granted political asylum,

83
0:04:08.705,000 --> 0:04:1,000
based on being a member of a social group.

84
0:04:11.53,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Some people may not realize this,

85
0:04:13.244,000 --> 0:04:16,000
but you can still get the death penalty in some countries for being gay.

86
0:04:18.897,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I had to give up my Jordanian citizenship.

87
0:04:20.965,000 --> 0:04:22,000
That was the hardest decision I've ever had to make,

88
0:04:23.438,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but I had no other choice.

89
0:04:29.207,000 --> 0:04:3,000
The point is,

90
0:04:31.326,000 --> 0:04:34,000
when you find yourself choosing between home and survival,

91
0:04:34.426,000 --> 0:04:36,000
the question "Where are you from?" becomes very loaded.

92
0:04:38.592,000 --> 0:04:41,000
A Syrian woman who I recently met at a refugee camp in Greece

93
0:04:41.883,000 --> 0:04:42,000
articulated it best,

94
0:04:43.175,000 --> 0:04:46,000
when she recalled the exact moment she realized she had to flee Aleppo.

95
0:04:47.097,000 --> 0:04:49,000
"I looked out the window and there was nothing.

96
0:04:49.379,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It was all rubble.

97
0:04:51.413,000 --> 0:04:54,000
There were no stores, no streets, no schools. Everything was gone.

98
0:04:55.826,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I had been in my apartment for months,

99
0:04:57.897,000 --> 0:05:,000
listening to bombs drop and watching people die.

100
0:05:01.591,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But I always thought it would get better,

101
0:05:04.848,000 --> 0:05:06,000
that no one could force me to leave,

102
0:05:06.946,000 --> 0:05:08,000
no one could take my home away from me.

103
0:05:09.615,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And I don't know why it was that morning, but when I looked outside,

104
0:05:12.911,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I realized if I didn't leave, my three young children would die.

105
0:05:16.073,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And so we left.

106
0:05:17.486,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We left because we had to, not because we wanted to.

107
0:05:20.514,000 --> 0:05:21,000
There was no choice," she said.

108
0:05:23.798,000 --> 0:05:25,000
It's kind of hard to believe that you belong

109
0:05:26.1,000 --> 0:05:27,000
when you don't have a home,

110
0:05:27.588,000 --> 0:05:31,000
when your country of origin rejects you because of fear or persecution,

111
0:05:31.618,000 --> 0:05:34,000
or the city that you grew up in is completely destroyed.

112
0:05:36.625,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I didn't feel like I had a home.

113
0:05:38.68,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I was no longer a Jordanian citizen,

114
0:05:41.161,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but I wasn't American, either.

115
0:05:43.463,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I felt a kind of loneliness

116
0:05:45.225,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that is still hard to put into words today.

117
0:05:48.601,000 --> 0:05:51,000
After college, I desperately needed to find a place to call home.

118
0:05:52.366,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I bounced around from state to state

119
0:05:54.106,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and eventually ended up in North Carolina.

120
0:05:56.565,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Kindhearted people who felt sorry for me

121
0:05:59.233,000 --> 0:06:,000
offered to pay rent

122
0:06:01.225,000 --> 0:06:04,000
or buy me a meal or a suit for my new interview.

123
0:06:04.563,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It just made me feel more isolated and incapable.

124
0:06:08.301,000 --> 0:06:09,000
It wasn't until I met Miss Sarah,

125
0:06:10.139,000 --> 0:06:13,000
a Southern Baptist who took me in at my lowest and gave me a job,

126
0:06:13.899,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that I started to believe in myself.

127
0:06:16.515,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Miss Sarah owned a diner in the mountains of North Carolina.

128
0:06:21.676,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I assumed, because of my privileged upbringing

129
0:06:23.869,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and my Seven Sister education,

130
0:06:25.412,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that she would ask me to manage the restaurant.

131
0:06:27.64,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I was wrong.

132
0:06:29.792,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I started off washing dishes,

133
0:06:31.519,000 --> 0:06:32,000
cleaning toilets and working the grill.

134
0:06:34.067,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I was humbled; I was shown the value of hard work.

135
0:06:37.176,000 --> 0:06:39,000
But most importantly, I felt valued and embraced.

136
0:06:40.744,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I celebrated Christmas with her family,

137
0:06:42.648,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and she attempted to observe Ramadan with me.

138
0:06:46.056,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I remember being very nervous about coming out to her --

139
0:06:48.75,000 --> 0:06:5,000
after all, she was a Southern Baptist.

140
0:06:50.816,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I sat on the couch next to her

141
0:06:52.3,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and I said, "Miss Sarah, you know that I'm gay."

142
0:06:54.855,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Her response is one that I will never forget.

143
0:06:57.535,000 --> 0:06:59,000
"That's fine, honey. Just don't be a slut."

144
0:06:59.758,000 --> 0:07:02,000
(Laughter)

145
0:07:02.954,000 --> 0:07:04,000
(Applause)

146
0:07:05.653,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I eventually moved to Atlanta, still trying to find my home.

147
0:07:12.081,000 --> 0:07:14,000
My journey took a strange turn three years later,

148
0:07:14.484,000 --> 0:07:17,000
after I met a group of refugee kids playing soccer outside.

149
0:07:18.138,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I'd made a wrong turn into this apartment complex,

150
0:07:20.702,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and I saw these kids outside playing soccer.

151
0:07:23.316,000 --> 0:07:25,000
They were playing barefoot with a raggedy soccer ball

152
0:07:25.903,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and rocks set up as goals.

153
0:07:27.379,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I watched them for about an hour,

154
0:07:29.103,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and after that I was smiling.

155
0:07:31.116,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The boys reminded me of home.

156
0:07:33.188,000 --> 0:07:35,000
They reminded me of the way I grew up playing soccer

157
0:07:35.69,000 --> 0:07:37,000
in the streets of Jordan, with my brothers and cousins.

158
0:07:39.612,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I eventually joined their game.

159
0:07:41.637,000 --> 0:07:43,000
They were a little skeptical about letting me join it,

160
0:07:44.504,000 --> 0:07:46,000
because according to them, girls don't know how to play.

161
0:07:47.19,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But obviously I did.

162
0:07:48.56,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I asked them if they had ever played on a team.

163
0:07:50.828,000 --> 0:07:52,000
They said they hadn't, but that they would love to.

164
0:07:53.751,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I gradually won them over, and we formed our first team.

165
0:07:57.671,000 --> 0:08:01,000
This group of kids would give me a crash course in refugees, poverty

166
0:08:03.817,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and humanity.

167
0:08:06.195,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Three brothers from Afghanistan -- Roohullah, Noorullah and Zabiullah --

168
0:08:09.774,000 --> 0:08:1,000
played a major role in that.

169
0:08:12.2,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I showed up late to practice one day to find the field completely deserted.

170
0:08:15.792,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I was really worried.

171
0:08:16.997,000 --> 0:08:17,000
My team loved to practice.

172
0:08:18.632,000 --> 0:08:2,000
It wasn't like them to miss practice.

173
0:08:21.263,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I got out of my car, and two kids ran out from behind a dumpster,

174
0:08:24.375,000 --> 0:08:25,000
waving their hands frantically.

175
0:08:26.915,000 --> 0:08:28,000
"Coach, Rooh got beat up. He got jumped.

176
0:08:28.986,000 --> 0:08:29,000
There was blood everywhere."

177
0:08:30.588,000 --> 0:08:32,000
"What do you mean? What do you mean he got beat up?"

178
0:08:33.067,000 --> 0:08:35,000
"These bad kids came and beat him up, Coach.

179
0:08:35.164,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Everybody left. They were all scared."

180
0:08:37.414,000 --> 0:08:39,000
We hopped into my car and drove over to Rooh's apartment.

181
0:08:40.156,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I knocked on the door, and Noor opened it.

182
0:08:43.409,000 --> 0:08:45,000
"Where's Rooh? I need to talk to him, see if he's OK."

183
0:08:46.185,000 --> 0:08:48,000
"He's in his room, Coach. He's refusing to come out."

184
0:08:49.145,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I knocked on the door.

185
0:08:50.336,000 --> 0:08:52,000
"Rooh, come on out. I need to talk to you.

186
0:08:52.786,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I need to see if you're OK or if we need to go to the hospital."

187
0:08:55.861,000 --> 0:08:56,000
He came out.

188
0:08:57.036,000 --> 0:08:59,000
He had a big gash on his head, a split lip,

189
0:08:59.839,000 --> 0:09:,000
and he was physically shaken.

190
0:09:02.334,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I was looking at him,

191
0:09:03.691,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and I asked the boys to call for their mom,

192
0:09:06.274,000 --> 0:09:08,000
because I needed to go to the hospital with him.

193
0:09:08.71,000 --> 0:09:09,000
They called for their mom.

194
0:09:10.428,000 --> 0:09:11,000
She came out.

195
0:09:12.059,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I had my back turned to her, and she started screaming in Farsi.

196
0:09:16.397,000 --> 0:09:18,000
The boys fell to the ground laughing.

197
0:09:18.496,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I was very confused,

198
0:09:19.672,000 --> 0:09:21,000
because there was nothing funny about this.

199
0:09:22.21,000 --> 0:09:24,000
They explained to me that she said,

200
0:09:24.234,000 --> 0:09:26,000
"You told me your coach was a Muslim and a woman."

201
0:09:27.072,000 --> 0:09:29,000
From behind, I didn't appear to be either to her.

202
0:09:29.465,000 --> 0:09:32,000
(Laughter)

203
0:09:33.122,000 --> 0:09:35,000
"I am Muslim," I said, turning to her.

204
0:09:35.382,000 --> 0:09:36,000

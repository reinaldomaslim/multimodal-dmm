1
0:00:13.292,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Women are works of art.

2
0:00:15.833,000 --> 0:00:17,000
On the outside as on the inside.

3
0:00:18.417,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I am a neuroscientist, and I focus on the inside,

4
0:00:21.833,000 --> 0:00:23,000
especially on women's brains.

5
0:00:24.417,000 --> 0:00:26,000
There are many theories on how women's brains differ

6
0:00:27.292,000 --> 0:00:28,000
from men's brains,

7
0:00:28.583,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and I've been looking at brains for 20 years

8
0:00:30.708,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and can guarantee that there is no such thing

9
0:00:33.708,000 --> 0:00:35,000
as a gendered brain.

10
0:00:35.792,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Pink and blue, Barbie and Lego,

11
0:00:38.125,000 --> 0:00:4,000
those are all inventions that have nothing to do

12
0:00:40.833,000 --> 0:00:42,000
with the way our brains are built.

13
0:00:44.125,000 --> 0:00:47,000
That said, women's brains differ from men's brains

14
0:00:47.25,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in some respects.

15
0:00:48.667,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And I'm here to talk about these differences,

16
0:00:50.917,000 --> 0:00:53,000
because they actually matter for our health.

17
0:00:54.25,000 --> 0:00:55,000
For example,

18
0:00:55.542,000 --> 0:00:58,000
women are more likely than men to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder

19
0:00:59.333,000 --> 0:01:,000
or depression,

20
0:01:00.75,000 --> 0:01:02,000
not to mention headaches and migraines.

21
0:01:03.5,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But also, at the core of my research,

22
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:09,000
women are more likely than men to have Alzheimer's disease.

23
0:01:09.75,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause

24
0:01:12.042,000 --> 0:01:14,000
of dementia on the planet,

25
0:01:14.208,000 --> 0:01:19,000
affecting close to six million people in the United States alone.

26
0:01:19.792,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But almost two thirds of all those people

27
0:01:23.333,000 --> 0:01:24,000
are actually women.

28
0:01:25.25,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So for every man suffering from Alzheimer's

29
0:01:28.042,000 --> 0:01:29,000
there are two women.

30
0:01:29.667,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So why is that overall?

31
0:01:32.667,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Is it age?

32
0:01:34.042,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Is it lifespan?

33
0:01:35.458,000 --> 0:01:37,000
What else could it be?

34
0:01:37.625,000 --> 0:01:38,000
A few years ago,

35
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I launched the Women's Brain Initiative

36
0:01:40.958,000 --> 0:01:42,000
at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City,

37
0:01:43.25,000 --> 0:01:45,000
exactly to answer those questions.

38
0:01:45.625,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And tonight, I'm here with some answers.

39
0:01:49.75,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So it turns out our brains age differently,

40
0:01:54.5,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and menopause plays a key role here for women.

41
0:01:59.25,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Now most people think of the brain as a kind of black box,

42
0:02:02.5,000 --> 0:02:03,000
isolated from the rest of the body.

43
0:02:04.5,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But in reality, our brains are in constant interaction

44
0:02:07.625,000 --> 0:02:08,000
with the rest of us.

45
0:02:08.917,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And perhaps surprisingly,

46
0:02:10.417,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the interactions with the reproductive system

47
0:02:14.042,000 --> 0:02:17,000
are crucial for brain aging in women.

48
0:02:17.875,000 --> 0:02:19,000
These interactions are mediated by our hormones.

49
0:02:20.667,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And we know that hormones differ between the genders.

50
0:02:24.667,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Men have more testosterone, women have more estrogens.

51
0:02:28.25,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But what really matters here

52
0:02:29.708,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is that these hormones differ in their longevity.

53
0:02:33.417,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Men's testosterone doesn't run out until late in life,

54
0:02:36.625,000 --> 0:02:4,000
which is a slow and pretty much symptom-free process, of course.

55
0:02:41.5,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:45.042,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Women's estrogens, on the other hand,

57
0:02:47.458,000 --> 0:02:49,000
start fading in midlife, during menopause,

58
0:02:50.458,000 --> 0:02:53,000
which is anything but symptom-free.

59
0:02:54.083,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We associate menopause with the ovaries,

60
0:02:57.042,000 --> 0:02:59,000
but when women say that they're having hot flashes,

61
0:02:59.875,000 --> 0:03:02,000
night sweats, insomnia, memory lapses, depression, anxiety,

62
0:03:03.833,000 --> 0:03:05,000
those symptoms don't start in the ovaries.

63
0:03:06.208,000 --> 0:03:08,000
They start in the brain.

64
0:03:08.792,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Those are neurological symptoms.

65
0:03:10.917,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We're just not used to thinking about them as such.

66
0:03:14.333,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So why is that?

67
0:03:15.667,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Why are our brains impacted by menopause?

68
0:03:19.417,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Well, first of all,

69
0:03:20.708,000 --> 0:03:24,000
our brains and ovaries are part of the neuroendocrine system.

70
0:03:24.833,000 --> 0:03:26,000
As part of the system, the brain talks to the ovaries

71
0:03:27.375,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and the ovaries talk back to the brain,

72
0:03:29.257,000 --> 0:03:32,000
every day of our lives as women.

73
0:03:32.375,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So the health of the ovaries is linked to the health of the brain.

74
0:03:36.292,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And the other way around.

75
0:03:38.333,000 --> 0:03:39,000
At the same time,

76
0:03:39.667,000 --> 0:03:42,000
hormones like estrogen are not only involved in reproduction,

77
0:03:43.333,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but also in brain function.

78
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And estrogen in particular, or estradiol,

79
0:03:48.583,000 --> 0:03:52,000
is really key for energy production in the brain.

80
0:03:52.75,000 --> 0:03:53,000
At the cellular level,

81
0:03:54.333,000 --> 0:03:57,000
estrogen literally pushes neurons to burn glucose to make energy.

82
0:03:58.333,000 --> 0:03:59,000
If your estrogen is high,

83
0:03:59.792,000 --> 0:04:01,000
your brain energy is high.

84
0:04:01.917,000 --> 0:04:03,000
When your estrogen declines though,

85
0:04:04.208,000 --> 0:04:07,000
your neurons start slowing down and age faster.

86
0:04:08.125,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And studies have shown that this process

87
0:04:10.208,000 --> 0:04:13,000
can even lead to the formation of amyloid plaques,

88
0:04:13.625,000 --> 0:04:14,000
or Alzheimer's plaques,

89
0:04:15.208,000 --> 0:04:18,000
which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.

90
0:04:18.333,000 --> 0:04:2,000
These effects are stronger in specific brain regions,

91
0:04:21.167,000 --> 0:04:22,000
starting with the hypothalamus,

92
0:04:23.083,000 --> 0:04:26,000
which is in charge of regulating body temperature.

93
0:04:26.208,000 --> 0:04:29,000
When estrogen doesn't activate the hypothalamus correctly,

94
0:04:29.292,000 --> 0:04:32,000
the brain cannot regulate body temperature correctly.

95
0:04:33.042,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So those hot flashes that women get,

96
0:04:35.458,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that's the hypothalamus.

97
0:04:37.583,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Then there's the brain stem, in charge of sleep and wake.

98
0:04:40.958,000 --> 0:04:42,000
When estrogen doesn't activate the brain stem correctly,

99
0:04:43.667,000 --> 0:04:44,000
we have trouble sleeping.

100
0:04:45.625,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Or it's the amygdala,

101
0:04:46.958,000 --> 0:04:49,000
the emotional center of the brain, close to the hippocampus,

102
0:04:50.25,000 --> 0:04:52,000
the memory center of the brain.

103
0:04:52.292,000 --> 0:04:54,000
When estrogen levels ebb in these regions,

104
0:04:55.167,000 --> 0:04:57,000
we start getting mood swings perhaps

105
0:04:57.25,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and forget things.

106
0:04:58.542,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So this is the brain anatomy of menopause, if you will.

107
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:04,000
But let me show you

108
0:05:04.292,000 --> 0:05:06,000
what an actual woman's brain can look like.

109
0:05:07.25,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So this is a kind of brain scan

110
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:11,000
called positron emission tomography or PET.

111
0:05:11.75,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It looks at brain energy levels.

112
0:05:13.875,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And this is what you want your brain to look like

113
0:05:17.542,000 --> 0:05:18,000
when you're in your 40s.

114
0:05:19.25,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Really nice and bright.

115
0:05:21.333,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Now this brain belongs to a woman who was 43 years old

116
0:05:24.417,000 --> 0:05:27,000
when she was first scanned, before menopause.

117
0:05:27.542,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And this is the same brain just eight years later,

118
0:05:32.417,000 --> 0:05:34,000
after menopause.

119
0:05:34.708,000 --> 0:05:35,000
If we put them side by side,

120
0:05:36.542,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I think you can easily see how the bright yellow

121
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:41,000
turned orange, almost purple.

122
0:05:41.792,000 --> 0:05:45,000
That's a 30 percent drop in brain energy levels.

123
0:05:47.417,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Now in general,

124
0:05:49.417,000 --> 0:05:54,000
this just doesn't seem to happen to a man of the same age.

125
0:05:54.792,000 --> 0:05:56,000
In our studies with hundreds of people,

126
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:01,000
we show that middle-aged men usually have high brain energy levels.

127
0:06:01.833,000 --> 0:06:05,000
For women, brain energy is usually fine before menopause,

128
0:06:06.042,000 --> 0:06:09,000
but then it gradually declines during the transition.

129
0:06:10.875,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And this was found independent of age.

130
0:06:13.792,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It didn't matter if the women were 40, 50 or 60.

131
0:06:16.917,000 --> 0:06:2,000
What mattered most was that they were in menopause.

132
0:06:21.417,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So of course we need more research to confirm this,

133
0:06:24.125,000 --> 0:06:26,000
but it looks like women's brains in midlife

134
0:06:26.75,000 --> 0:06:28,000
are more sensitive to hormonal aging

135
0:06:29.417,000 --> 0:06:31,000
than just straight up chronological aging.

136
0:06:32.042,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And this is important information to have,

137
0:06:34.208,000 --> 0:06:37,000
because so many women can feel these changes.

138
0:06:37.542,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So many of our patients have said to me

139
0:06:39.542,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that they feel like their minds are playing tricks on them,

140
0:06:42.542,000 --> 0:06:43,000
to put it mildly.

141
0:06:44.208,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So I really want to validate this, because it's real.

142
0:06:47.417,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And so just to clarify, if this is you,

143
0:06:50.833,000 --> 0:06:52,000
you are not crazy.

144
0:06:53.125,000 --> 0:06:54,000
(Laughter)

145
0:06:54.875,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Applause)

146
0:06:56.667,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Thank you.

147
0:06:58.708,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It's important.

148
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So many women have worried that they might be losing their minds.

149
0:07:03.083,000 --> 0:07:06,000
But the truth is that your brain might be going through a transition,

150
0:07:06.667,000 --> 0:07:07,000
or is going through a transition

151
0:07:08.215,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and needs time and support to adjust.

152
0:07:11.333,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Also, if anyone is concerned

153
0:07:12.917,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that middle-aged women might be underperformers,

154
0:07:16.042,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I'll just quickly add that we looked at cognitive performance,

155
0:07:19.167,000 --> 0:07:2,000
God forbid, right?

156
0:07:20.5,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

157
0:07:21.958,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Let's not do that.

158
0:07:23.708,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But we looked at cognitive performance,

159
0:07:25.625,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and we found absolutely no differences between men and women

160
0:07:29.083,000 --> 0:07:31,000
before and after menopause.

161
0:07:31.708,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And other studies confirm this.

162
0:07:33.958,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So basically, we may be tired,

163
0:07:36.792,000 --> 0:07:38,000
but we are just as sharp.

164
0:07:38.958,000 --> 0:07:4,000
(Laughter)

165
0:07:41.375,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Get that out of the way.

166
0:07:43.417,000 --> 0:07:44,000
That all said,

167
0:07:44.708,000 --> 0:07:47,000
there is something else more serious that deserves our attention.

168
0:07:47.792,000 --> 0:07:48,000
If you remember,

169
0:07:49.083,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I mentioned that estrogen declines could potentially promote

170
0:07:51.958,000 --> 0:07:53,000
the formation of amyloid plaques, or Alzheimer's plaques.

171
0:07:54.833,000 --> 0:07:57,000
But there's another kind of brain scan that looks exactly at those plaques.

172
0:07:58.458,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And we used it to show that middle-aged men hardly have any,

173
0:08:02.333,000 --> 0:08:03,000
which is great.

174
0:08:03.625,000 --> 0:08:04,000
But for women,

175
0:08:05.083,000 --> 0:08:1,000
there's quite a bit of an increase during the transition to menopause.

176
0:08:10.292,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And I want to be really, really clear here

177
0:08:12.375,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that not all women develop the plaques,

178
0:08:14.792,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and not all women with the plaques develop dementia.

179
0:08:18.042,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Having the plaques is a risk factor,

180
0:08:20.083,000 --> 0:08:24,000
it is not in any way a diagnosis, especially at this stage.

181
0:08:24.5,000 --> 0:08:26,000
But still, it's quite an insight

182
0:08:26.792,000 --> 0:08:28,000
to associate Alzheimer's with menopause.

183
0:08:29.458,000 --> 0:08:31,000
We think of menopause as belonging to middle age

184
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and Alzheimer's as belonging to old age.

185
0:08:34.542,000 --> 0:08:35,000
But in reality,

186
0:08:35.833,000 --> 0:08:37,000
many studies, including my own work,

187
0:08:37.875,000 --> 0:08:41,000
had shown that Alzheimer's disease starts with negative changes in the brain

188
0:08:42.125,000 --> 0:08:46,000
years, if not decades, prior to clinical symptoms.

189
0:08:46.708,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So for women,

190
0:08:48.042,000 --> 0:08:5,000
it looks like this process starts in midlife,

191
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:52,000
during menopause.

192
0:08:52.417,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Which is important information to have,

193
0:08:54.333,000 --> 0:08:58,000
because it gives us a time line to start looking for those changes.

194
0:08:58.583,000 --> 0:09:,000
So in terms of a time line,

195
0:09:00.75,000 --> 0:09:03,000
most women go through menopause in their early 50s.

196
0:09:04.125,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But it can be earlier,

197
0:09:05.917,000 --> 0:09:07,000
often because of medical interventions.

198
0:09:08.833,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And the common example is a hysterectomy and/or an oophorectomy,

199
0:09:12.75,000 --> 0:09:14,000
which is the surgical removal of the uterus

200
0:09:15.417,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and/or the ovaries.

201
0:09:17.375,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And unfortunately, there is evidence

202
0:09:19.875,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that having the uterus and, more so, the ovaries removed

203
0:09:23.083,000 --> 0:09:24,000
prior to menopause

204
0:09:24.833,000 --> 0:09:28,000
correlates with the higher risk of dementia in women.

205
0:09:29.458,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And I know that this is upsetting news,

206
0:09:31.583,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and it's definitely depressing news,

207
0:09:33.708,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but we need to talk about it

208
0:09:35.375,000 --> 0:09:38,000
because most women are not aware of this correlation,

209
0:09:38.917,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and it seems like very important information to have.

210
0:09:42.125,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Also, no one is suggesting that women decline these procedures

211
0:09:45.208,000 --> 0:09:46,000
if they need them.

212
0:09:46.917,000 --> 0:09:49,000
The point here is that we really need to better understand

213
0:09:50.625,000 --> 0:09:53,000
what happens to our brains as we go through menopause,

214
0:09:54.042,000 --> 0:09:55,000
natural or medical,

215
0:09:55.75,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and how to protect our brains in the process.

216
0:09:59.208,000 --> 0:10:,000
So how do we do that?

217
0:10:00.583,000 --> 0:10:01,000
How do we protect our brains?

218
0:10:02.042,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Should we take hormones?

219
0:10:03.917,000 --> 0:10:05,000
That's a fair question, it's a good question.

220
0:10:06.583,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And the shortest possible answer right now

221
0:10:09.208,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is that hormonal therapy can be helpful

222
0:10:11.708,000 --> 0:10:14,000
to alleviate a number of symptoms, like hot flashes,

223
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:18,000
but it's not currently recommended for dementia prevention.

224
0:10:18.792,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And many of us are working on testing different formulations

225
0:10:22.208,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and different dosages and different time lines,

226
0:10:24.792,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and hopefully, all this work will lead to a change in recommendations

227
0:10:28.875,000 --> 0:10:29,000
in the future.

228
0:10:30.792,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Meanwhile, there are other things that we can do today

229
0:10:34.167,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to support our hormones and their effects on the brain

230
0:10:36.917,000 --> 0:10:38,000
that do not require medications

231
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:42,000
but do require taking a good look at our lifestyle.

232
0:10:42.958,000 --> 0:10:44,000
That's because the foods we eat,

233
0:10:45.25,000 --> 0:10:46,000
how much exercise we get,

234
0:10:46.958,000 --> 0:10:48,000
how much sleep we get or don't get,

235
0:10:49.125,000 --> 0:10:5,000
how much stress we have in our lives,

236
0:10:51.125,000 --> 0:10:54,000
those are all things that can actually impact our hormones --

237
0:10:54.333,000 --> 0:10:56,000
for better and for worse.

238
0:10:56.708,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Food, for example.

239
0:10:58.708,000 --> 0:10:59,000
There are many diets out there,

240
0:11:00.625,000 --> 0:11:03,000
but studies have shown that the Mediterranean diet in particular

241
0:11:04.458,000 --> 0:11:07,000
is supportive of women's health.

242
0:11:07.667,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Women on this diet have a much lower risk

243
0:11:11.125,000 --> 0:11:13,000
of cognitive decline, of depression,

244
0:11:13.667,000 --> 0:11:16,000
of heart disease, of stroke and of cancer,

245
0:11:16.708,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and they also have fewer hot flashes.

246
0:11:19.542,000 --> 0:11:21,000
What's interesting about this diet

247
0:11:21.875,000 --> 0:11:25,000
is that it's quite rich in foods that contain estrogens

248
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
in the form of phytoestrogens or estrogens from plants

249
0:11:29.667,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that act like mild estrogens in our bodies.

250
0:11:32.667,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Some phytoestrogens have been linked to a possible risk of cancer,

251
0:11:36.167,000 --> 0:11:39,000
but not the ones in this diet, which are safe.

252
0:11:39.375,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Especially from flax seeds,

253
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:44,000
sesame seeds, dried apricots,

254
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:47,000
legumes and a number of fruits.

255
0:11:47.583,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And for some good news,

256
0:11:49.5,000 --> 0:11:53,000
dark chocolate contains phytoestrogens, too.

257
0:11:53.667,000 --> 0:11:55,000
So diet is one way to gain estrogens,

258
0:11:56.083,000 --> 0:12:,000
but it's just as important to avoid things that suppress our estrogens instead,

259
0:12:00.375,000 --> 0:12:01,000
especially stress.

260
0:12:02.333,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Stress can literally steal your estrogens,

261
0:12:05.333,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and that's because cortisol, which is the main stress hormone,

262
0:12:08.833,000 --> 0:12:1,000
works in balance with our estrogens.

263
0:12:11.458,000 --> 0:12:13,000
So if cortisol goes up, your estrogens go down.

264
0:12:14.167,000 --> 0:12:16,000
If cortisol goes down, your estrogens go back up.

265
0:12:17.083,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So reducing stress is really important.

266
0:12:19.375,000 --> 0:12:21,000
It doesn't just help your day,

267
0:12:21.667,000 --> 0:12:23,000
it also helps your brain.

268
0:12:24.417,000 --> 0:12:25,000
So these are just a few things

269
0:12:25.958,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that we can do to support our brains

270
0:12:27.708,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and there are more.

271
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:3,000
But the important thing here

272
0:12:30.417,000 --> 0:12:33,000
is that changing the way we understand the female brain

273
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:37,000
really changes the way that we care for it,

274
0:12:37.167,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and the way that we frame women's health.

275
0:12:39.958,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And the more women demand this information,

276
0:12:42.917,000 --> 0:12:45,000
the sooner we'll be able to break the taboos around menopause,

277
0:12:46.333,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and also come up with solutions that actually work,

278
0:12:49.25,000 --> 0:12:5,000
not just for Alzheimer's disease,

279
0:12:50.875,000 --> 0:12:52,000
but for women's brain health as a whole.

280
0:12:53.583,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Brain health is women's health.

281
0:12:56.292,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Thank you.

282
0:12:57.583,000 --> 0:12:58,000
(Applause)

283
0:12:59.542,000 --> 0:13:,000
Thank you.

284
0:13:00.833,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Oh, thank you.

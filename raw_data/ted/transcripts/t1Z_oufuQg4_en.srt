1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Do you remember the story

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
of Odysseus and the Sirens

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
from high school or junior high school?

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
There was this hero, Odysseus, who's heading back home

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
after the Trojan War.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And he's standing on the deck of his ship,

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
he's talking to his first mate,

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and he's saying,

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"Tomorrow, we will sail past those rocks,

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and on those rocks sit some beautiful women

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
called Sirens.

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And these women sing an enchanting song,

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
a song so alluring

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that all sailors who hear it

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
crash into the rocks and die."

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Now you would expect, given that,

17
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that they would choose an alternate route around the Sirens,

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but instead Odysseus says,

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
"I want to hear that song.

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
And so what I'm going to do

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
is I'm going to pour wax in the ears

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
of you and all the men --

23
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
stay with me --

24
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
so that you can't hear the song,

25
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and then I'm going to have you tie me to the mast

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
so that I can listen

27
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and we can all sail by unaffected."

28
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So this is a captain

29
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
putting the life of every single person on the ship at risk

30
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
so that he can hear a song.

31
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And I'd like to think if this was the case,

32
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
they probably would have rehearsed it a few times.

33
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Odysseus would have said, "Okay, let's do a dry run.

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
You tie me to the mast, and I'm going to beg and plead.

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And no matter what I say, you cannot untie me from the mast.

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
All right, so tie me to the mast."

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And the first mate takes a rope

38
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and ties Odysseus to the mast in a nice knot.

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And Odysseus does his best job playacting

40
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and says, "Untie me. Untie me.

41
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I want to hear that song. Untie me."

42
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And the first mate wisely resists

43
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and doesn't untie Odysseus.

44
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And then Odysseus says, "I see that you can get it.

45
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
All right, untie me now and we'll get some dinner."

46
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
And the first mate hesitates.

47
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
He's like, "Is this still the rehearsal,

48
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
or should I untie him?"

49
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And the first mate thinks,

50
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
"Well, I guess at some point the rehearsal has to end."

51
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So he unties Odysseus, and Odysseus flips out.

52
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
He's like, "You idiot. You moron.

53
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
If you do that tomorrow, I'll be dead, you'll be dead,

54
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
every single one of the men will be dead.

55
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Now just don't untie me no matter what."

56
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
He throws the first mate to the ground.

57
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
This repeats itself through the night --

58
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
rehearsal, tying to the mast,

59
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
conning his way out of it,

60
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
beating the poor first mate up mercilessly.

61
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Hilarity ensues.

62
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Tying yourself to a mast

63
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
is perhaps the oldest written example

64
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
of what psychologists call a commitment device.

65
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
A commitment device is a decision that you make

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
with a cool head to bind yourself

67
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
so that you don't do something regrettable

68
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
when you have a hot head.

69
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Because there's two heads inside one person

70
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
when you think about it.

71
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves

72
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
when it comes to questions of temptation.

73
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
There is first, the present self.

74
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
This is like Odysseus when he's hearing the song.

75
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
He just wants to get to the front row.

76
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
He just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification.

77
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But then there's this other self, the future self.

78
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
This is Odysseus as an old man

79
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
who wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa

80
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
with his wife Penelope

81
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
outside of Ithaca -- the other one.

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So why do we need commitment devices?

83
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Well resisting temptation is hard,

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
as the 19th century English economist

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Nassau William Senior said,

86
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
"To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power,

87
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
or to seek distant rather than immediate results,

88
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
are among the most painful exertions

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
of the human will."

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
If you set goals for yourself and you're like a lot of other people,

91
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
you probably realize

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
it's not that your goals are physically impossible

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that's keeping you from achieving them,

94
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
it's that you lack the self-discipline to stick to them.

95
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It's physically possible to lose weight.

96
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It's physically possible to exercise more.

97
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But resisting temptation

98
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
is hard.

99
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The other reason

100
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that it's difficult to resist temptation

101
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
is because it's an unequal battle

102
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
between the present self and the future self.

103
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I mean, let's face it, the present self is present.

104
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It's in control. It's in power right now.

105
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It has these strong, heroic arms

106
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that can lift doughnuts into your mouth.

107
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And the future self is not even around.

108
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
It's off in the future. It's weak.

109
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
It doesn't even have a lawyer present.

110
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
There's nobody to stick up for the future self.

111
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And so the present self can trounce

112
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
all over its dreams.

113
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So there's this battle between the two selves that's being fought,

114
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and we need commitment devices

115
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to level the playing field between the two.

116
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Now I'm a big fan of commitment devices actually.

117
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Tying yourself to the mast is the oldest one, but there are other ones

118
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
such as locking a credit card away with a key

119
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
or not bringing junk food into the house so you won't eat it

120
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
or unplugging your Internet connection

121
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
so you can use your computer.

122
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I was creating commitment devices of my own

123
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
long before I knew what they were.

124
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So when I was a starving post-doc

125
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
at Columbia University,

126
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I was deep in a publish-or-perish phase of my career.

127
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I had to write five pages a day

128
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
towards papers

129
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
or I would have to give up five dollars.

130
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And when you try to execute these commitment devices,

131
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
you realize the devil is really in the details.

132
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Because it's not that easy to get rid of five dollars.

133
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I mean, you can't burn it; that's illegal.

134
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And I thought, well I could give it to a charity

135
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
or give it to my wife or something like that.

136
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
But then I thought, oh, I'm sending myself mixed messages.

137
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Because not writing is bad, but giving to charity is good.

138
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So then I would kind of justify not writing

139
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
by giving a gift.

140
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And then I kind of flipped that around and thought,

141
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
well I could give it to the neo-Nazis.

142
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But then I was like, that's more bad than writing is good,

143
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and so that wouldn't work.

144
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So ultimately, I just decided

145
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I would leave it in an envelope on the subway.

146
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Sometimes a good person would find it,

147
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
sometimes a bad person would find it.

148
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
On average, it was just a completely pointless exchange of money

149
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that I would regret.

150
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Laughter)

151
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Such it is with commitment devices.

152
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But despite my like for them,

153
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
there's two nagging concerns

154
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that I've always had about commitment devices,

155
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and you might feel this if you use them yourself.

156
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So the first is,

157
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
when you've got one of these devices going,

158
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
such as this contract to write everyday or pay,

159
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
it's just a constant reminder

160
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that you have no self-control.

161
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
You're just telling yourself, "Without you, commitment device,

162
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I am nothing, I have no self-discipline."

163
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And then when you're ever in a situation

164
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
where you don't have a commitment device in place --

165
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
like, "Oh my God, that person's offering me a doughnut,

166
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and I have no defense mechanism," --

167
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
you just eat it.

168
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So I don't like the way that they take the power away from you.

169
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I think self-discipline is something, it's like a muscle.

170
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
The more you exercise it, the stronger it gets.

171
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The other problem with commitment devices

172
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
is that you can always weasel your way out of them.

173
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
You say, "Well, of course I can't write today,

174
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
because I'm giving a TEDTalk and I have five media interviews,

175
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and then I'm going to a cocktail party and then I'll be drunk after that.

176
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And so there's no way that this is going to work."

177
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So in effect, you are like Odysseus and the first mate

178
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
in one person.

179
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
You're putting yourself, you're binding yourself,

180
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and you're weaseling your way out of it,

181
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and then you're beating yourself up afterwards.

182
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So I've been working

183
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
for about a decade now

184
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
on finding other ways

185
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
to change people's relationship to the future self

186
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
without using commitment devices.

187
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
In particular, I'm interested in the relationship

188
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
to the future financial self.

189
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And this is a timely issue.

190
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I'm talking about the topic of saving.

191
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
Now saving is a classic two selves problem.

192
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
The present self does not want to save at all.

193
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
It wants to consume.

194
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Whereas the future self wants the present self to save.

195
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So this is a timely problem.

196
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We look at the savings rate

197
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and it has been declining since the 1950s.

198
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
At the same time, the Retirement Risk Index,

199
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
the chance of not being able to meet your needs in retirement,

200
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
has been increasing.

201
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And we're at a situation now

202
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
where for every three baby boomers,

203
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
the McKinsey Global Institute predicts

204
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs

205
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
while they're in retirement.

206
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So what can we do about this?

207
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
There's a philosopher, Derek Parfit,

208
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and I.

209
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
He said that, "We might neglect our future selves

210
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
because of some failure of belief or imagination."

211
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
That is to say,

212
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
we somehow might not believe that we're going to get old,

213
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
or we might not be able to imagine

214
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that we're going to get old some day.

215
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
On the one hand, it sounds ridiculous.

216
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Of course, we know that we're going to get old.

217
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
But aren't there things that we believe and don't believe at the same time?

218
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So my coauthors and I have used computers,

219
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
the greatest tool of our time,

220
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to assist people's imagination

221
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and help them imagine what it might be like

222
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
to go into the future.

223
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And I'll show you some of these tools right here.

224
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
The first is called the distribution builder.

225
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
It shows people what the future might be like

226
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
by showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes

227
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that might be obtained in the future.

228
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Each outcome is shown by one of these markers,

229
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and each sits on a row

230
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
that represents a level of wealth and retirement.

231
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Being up at the top

232
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
means that you're enjoying a high income in retirement.

233
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Being down at the bottom

234
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
means that you're struggling to make ends meet.

235
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
When you make an investment,

236
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
what you're really saying is, "I accept

237
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that any one of these 100 things

238
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
could happen to me and determine my wealth."

239
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Now you can try to move your outcomes around.

240
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
You can try to manipulate your fate, like this person is doing,

241
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
but it costs you something to do it.

242
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It means that you have to save more today.

243
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Once you find an investment that you're happy with,

244
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
what people do is they click "done"

245
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and the markers begin to disappear,

246
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
slowly, one by one.

247
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
It simulates what it is like to invest in something

248
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and to watch that investment pan out.

249
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
At the end, there will only be one marker left standing

250
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and it will determine our wealth in retirement.

251
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Yes, this person retired

252
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
at 150 percent of their working income in retirement.

253
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
They're making more money while retired

254
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
than they were making while they were working.

255
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
If you're like most people,

256
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy --

257
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
just to think about making

258
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
50 percent more money in retirement than before.

259
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
However, had you ended up on the very bottom,

260
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
it might have given you a slight sense

261
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
of dread and/or nausea

262
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
thinking about struggling to get by in retirement.

263
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
By using this tool over and over

264
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and simulating outcome after outcome,

265
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
people can understand

266
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that the investments and savings that they undertake today

267
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
determine their well-being in the future.

268
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Now people are motivated through emotions,

269
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
but different people find different things motivating.

270
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
This is a simulation

271
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
that uses graphics,

272
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
but other people find motivating what money can buy,

273
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
not just numbers.

274
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So here I made a distribution builder

275
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
where instead of showing numerical outcomes,

276
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I show people what those outcomes will get you,

277
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
in particular apartments that you can afford

278
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
if you're retiring on 3,000, 2,500,

279
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
2,000 dollars per month and so on.

280
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
As you move down the ladder of apartments,

281
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
you see that they get worse and worse.

282
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Some of them look like places I lived in as a graduate student.

283
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And as you get to the very bottom,

284
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
you're faced with the unfortunate reality

285
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that if you don't save anything for retirement,

286
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
you won't be able to afford any housing at all.

287
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Those are actual pictures of actual apartments

288
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
renting for that amount

289
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
as advertised on the Internet.

290
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
The last thing I'll show you,

291
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
the last behavioral time machine,

292
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
is something that I created with Hal Hershfield,

293
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project,

294
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Bill Sharpe.

295
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And what it is

296
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
is an exploration into virtual reality.

297
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
So what we do is we take pictures of people --

298
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
in this case, college-age people --

299
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and we use software to age them

300
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and show these people what they'll look like

301
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
when they're 60, 70, 80 years old.

302
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And we try to test

303
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
whether actually assisting your imagination

304
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
by looking at the face of your future self

305
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
can change you investment behavior.

306
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
So this is one of our experiments.

307
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Here we see the face of the young subject on the left.

308
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
He's given a control

309
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
that allows him to adjust his savings rate.

310
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
As he moves his savings rate down,

311
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
it means that he's saving zero

312
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
when it's all the way here at the left.

313
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
You can see his current annual income --

314
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today --

315
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
is quite high, 91 percent,

316
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
but his retirement income is quite low.

317
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
He's going to retire on 44 percent

318
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
of what he earned while he was working.

319
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
If he saves the maximum legal amount,

320
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
his retirement income goes up,

321
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
but he's unhappy

322
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
because now he has less money on the left-hand side to spend today.

323
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Other conditions show people the future self.

324
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And from the future self's point of view, everything is in reverse.

325
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
If you save very little,

326
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
the future self is unhappy

327
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
living on 44 percent of the income.

328
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Whereas if the present self saves a lot,

329
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
the future self is delighted,

330
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
where the income is close up near 100 percent.

331
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
To bring this to a wider audience,

332
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I've been working with Hal and Allianz

333
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
to create something we call the behavioral time machine,

334
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
in which you not only get to see yourself in the future,

335
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
but you get to see anticipated emotional reactions

336
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
to different levels of retirement wealth.

337
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
So for instance,

338
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
here is somebody using the tool.

339
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And just watch the facial expressions

340
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
as they move the slider.

341
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
The younger face gets happier and happier, saving nothing.

342
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
The older face is miserable.

343
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And slowly, slowly we're bringing it up to a moderate savings rate.

344
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And then it's a high savings rate.

345
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
The younger face is getting unhappy.

346
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
The older face is quite pleased

347
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
with the decision.

348
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
We're going to see if this has an effect on what people do.

349
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And what's nice about it

350
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
is it's not something that biasing people actually,

351
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
because as one face smiles,

352
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
the other face frowns.

353
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
It's not telling you which way to put the slider,

354
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
it's just reminding you that you are

355
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
connected to and legally tied to

356
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
this future self.

357
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Your decisions today are going to determine its well-being.

358
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And that's something that's easy to forget.

359
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
This use of virtual reality

360
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
is not just good for making people look older.

361
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
There are programs you can get

362
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
to see how people might look

363
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
if they smoke, if they get too much exposure to the sun,

364
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
if they gain weight and so on.

365
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And what's good is,

366
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
unlike in the experiments that Hal and myself ran with Russ Smith,

367
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
you don't have to program these by yourself

368
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
in order to see the virtual reality.

369
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
There are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars

370
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
that do the same thing.

371
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
This is actually a picture of Hal, my coauthor.

372
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
You might recognize him from the previous demos.

373
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And just for kicks we ran his picture

374
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
through the balding, aging and weight gain software

375
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
to see how he would look.

376
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Hal is here, so I think we owe it to him as well as yourself

377
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
to disabuse you of that last image.

378
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And I'll close it there.

379
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
On behalf of Hal and myself,

380
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
I wish all the best to your present and future selves.

381
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Thank you.

382
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
(Applause)

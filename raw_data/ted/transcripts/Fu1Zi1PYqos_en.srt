2
0:00:12.913,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'm going to start by saying something you think you know to be true.

3
0:00:18.706,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Your brain creates all facets of your mind.

4
0:00:23.133,000 --> 0:00:26,000
So then why do we treat mental and physical illnesses

5
0:00:26.808,000 --> 0:00:27,000
so differently,

6
0:00:28.006,000 --> 0:00:3,000
if we think we know that the mind comes from the brain?

7
0:00:32.197,000 --> 0:00:33,000
As a neuroscientist, I'm often told

8
0:00:34.102,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that I'm not allowed to study how internal states

9
0:00:37.114,000 --> 0:00:4,000
like anxiety or craving or loneliness

10
0:00:40.616,000 --> 0:00:41,000
are represented by the brain,

11
0:00:42.433,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and so I decided to set out and do exactly that.

12
0:00:47.87,000 --> 0:00:5,000
My research program is designed to understand the mind

13
0:00:50.967,000 --> 0:00:52,000
by investigating brain circuits.

14
0:00:53.347,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Specifically, how does our brain give rise to emotion.

15
0:00:57.847,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It's really hard to study feelings and emotions,

16
0:01:00.815,000 --> 0:01:02,000
because you can't measure them.

17
0:01:03.351,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Behavior is still the best and only window

18
0:01:07.634,000 --> 0:01:09,000
into the emotional experience of another.

19
0:01:11.359,000 --> 0:01:13,000
For both animals and people,

20
0:01:13.688,000 --> 0:01:15,000
yes, self-report is a behavioral output.

21
0:01:17.633,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Motivated behaviors fall into two general classes:

22
0:01:20.863,000 --> 0:01:22,000
seeking pleasure and avoiding pain.

23
0:01:24.099,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The ability to approach things that are good for you

24
0:01:26.552,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and avoid things that are bad for you

25
0:01:28.369,000 --> 0:01:29,000
is fundamental to survival.

26
0:01:29.702,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And in our modern-day society,

27
0:01:31.361,000 --> 0:01:34,000
trouble telling the difference can be labeled as a mental illness.

28
0:01:35.653,000 --> 0:01:37,000
If I was having car trouble,

29
0:01:38.478,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and I took my car to the mechanic,

30
0:01:40.343,000 --> 0:01:43,000
the first thing they do is look under the hood.

31
0:01:44.593,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But with mental health research,

32
0:01:47.045,000 --> 0:01:5,000
you can't just pop open the hood with the press of a button.

33
0:01:50.911,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So this is why we do experiments on animals.

34
0:01:53.648,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Specifically, in my lab, mice.

35
0:01:57.585,000 --> 0:02:,000
To understand the brain, well, we need to study brains.

36
0:02:01.752,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And for the first time, we actually can.

37
0:02:04.586,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We can pop open the hood.

38
0:02:06.229,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We can look inside

39
0:02:07.705,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and do an experiment and see what comes out.

40
0:02:12.149,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Technology has opened new windows into the black box that is our minds.

41
0:02:17.363,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The development of optogenetic tools

42
0:02:20.99,000 --> 0:02:24,000
has allowed us unprecedented control over specific neurons in the brain

43
0:02:25.467,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and how they talk to each other by firing electrical signals.

44
0:02:30.109,000 --> 0:02:33,000
We can genetically engineer neurons to be light sensitive

45
0:02:33.348,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and then use light to control how neurons fire.

46
0:02:37.426,000 --> 0:02:39,000
This can change an animal's behavior,

47
0:02:39.577,000 --> 0:02:42,000
giving us insight into what that neural circuit can do.

48
0:02:43.895,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Want to know how scientists figure this out?

49
0:02:47.855,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Scientists developed optogenetic tools by borrowing knowledge

50
0:02:51.347,000 --> 0:02:53,000
from other basic science fields.

51
0:02:53.887,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Algae are single-celled organisms that have evolved to swim towards light.

52
0:02:58.783,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And when blue light shines onto the eyespot of an algae cell,

53
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
a channel opens, sending an electrical signal

54
0:03:05.538,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that makes little flagella flap

55
0:03:07.411,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and propels the algae towards sunlight.

56
0:03:10.482,000 --> 0:03:13,000
If we clone this light-sensitive part of the algae

57
0:03:13.569,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and then add it to neurons through genetic modification,

58
0:03:17.279,000 --> 0:03:19,000
we can make neurons light-sensitive, too.

59
0:03:20.755,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Except, with neurons,

60
0:03:22.716,000 --> 0:03:25,000
when we shine light down an optical fiber deep into the brain,

61
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
we change how they send electrical signals to other neurons in the brain

62
0:03:30.228,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and thus change the animal's behavior.

63
0:03:34.014,000 --> 0:03:35,000
With the help of my colleagues,

64
0:03:35.736,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I pioneered the use of optogenetic tools

65
0:03:38.609,000 --> 0:03:41,000
to selectively target neurons that are living in point A,

66
0:03:42.431,000 --> 0:03:45,000
sending messages down wires aimed at point B,

67
0:03:47.899,000 --> 0:03:5,000
leaving neighboring neurons going other places unaffected.

68
0:03:52.347,000 --> 0:03:56,000
This approach allowed us to test the function of each wire

69
0:03:56.466,000 --> 0:03:58,000
within the tangled mess that is our brain.

70
0:03:59.775,000 --> 0:04:,000
A brain region called the amygdala

71
0:04:01.609,000 --> 0:04:03,000
has long been thought to be important for emotion,

72
0:04:04.149,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and my laboratory discovered

73
0:04:05.863,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that the amygdala resembles a fork in the road

74
0:04:08.18,000 --> 0:04:12,000
where activating one path can drive positive emotion and approach,

75
0:04:12.347,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and activating another path can drive negative emotion and avoidance.

76
0:04:18.6,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I'm going to show you a couple of examples --

77
0:04:20.72,000 --> 0:04:22,000
a taste of raw data --

78
0:04:22.966,000 --> 0:04:26,000
of how we can use optogenetics to target specific neurons in the brain

79
0:04:26.998,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and get very specific changes in behavior.

80
0:04:30.117,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Anxiety patients have abnormal communication

81
0:04:33.499,000 --> 0:04:35,000
between two parts of the amygdala,

82
0:04:35.665,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but in people, it's hard to know if this abnormality is cause or effect

83
0:04:40.573,000 --> 0:04:41,000
of the disease.

84
0:04:42.787,000 --> 0:04:46,000
We can use optogenetics to target the same pathway in a mouse,

85
0:04:47.533,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and see what happens.

86
0:04:48.747,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So this is the elevated plus maze.

87
0:04:51.57,000 --> 0:04:52,000
It's a widely used anxiety test

88
0:04:53.372,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that measures the amount of time

89
0:04:55.34,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that the mouse spends in the safety of the closed arms

90
0:04:58.094,000 --> 0:05:,000
relative to exploring the open arms.

91
0:05:01.046,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Mice have evolved to prefer enclosed spaces,

92
0:05:04.055,000 --> 0:05:05,000
like the safety of their burrows,

93
0:05:06.032,000 --> 0:05:08,000
but to find food, water, mates,

94
0:05:08.398,000 --> 0:05:1,000
they need to go out into the open

95
0:05:10.969,000 --> 0:05:12,000
where they're more vulnerable to predatory threats.

96
0:05:14.039,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So I'm sitting in the background here,

97
0:05:16.071,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and I'm about to flip the switch.

98
0:05:18.158,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And now, when I flip the switch and turn the light on,

99
0:05:20.914,000 --> 0:05:24,000
you can see the mouse begins to explore the open arms of the maze more.

100
0:05:25.843,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And in contrast to drug treatments for anxiety,

101
0:05:29.716,000 --> 0:05:32,000
there's no sedation, no locomotor impairment,

102
0:05:33.137,000 --> 0:05:36,000
just coordinated, natural-looking exploration.

103
0:05:37.406,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So not only is the effect almost immediate,

104
0:05:40.85,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but there are no detectable side effects.

105
0:05:43.97,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Now, when I flip the switch off,

106
0:05:45.843,000 --> 0:05:48,000
you can see that the mouse goes back to its normal brain function

107
0:05:49.676,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and back to its corner.

108
0:05:52.427,000 --> 0:05:55,000
When I was in the lab and I was taking these data,

109
0:05:56.077,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I was all by myself, and I was so excited.

110
0:05:59.632,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I was so excited, I did one of these quiet screams.

111
0:06:02.053,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Silently) Aah!

112
0:06:03.578,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Laughter)

113
0:06:05.601,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Why was I so excited?

114
0:06:06.815,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I mean, yeah, theoretically, I knew that the brain controlled the mind,

115
0:06:10.627,000 --> 0:06:12,000
but to flip the switch with my hand

116
0:06:13.156,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and see the mouse change its behavioral state

117
0:06:15.476,000 --> 0:06:17,000
so rapidly and so reversibly,

118
0:06:17.974,000 --> 0:06:2,000
it was really the first time that I truly believed it.

119
0:06:22.45,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Since that first breakthrough,

120
0:06:24.315,000 --> 0:06:26,000
there have been a number of other discoveries.

121
0:06:26.846,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Finding specific neural circuits that can elicit dramatic changes

122
0:06:30.401,000 --> 0:06:31,000
in animal behavior.

123
0:06:32.956,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Here's another example: compulsive overeating.

124
0:06:36.633,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We can eat for two reasons.

125
0:06:38.649,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Seeking pleasure, like tasty food,

126
0:06:41.212,000 --> 0:06:43,000
or avoiding pain, like being hungry.

127
0:06:44.603,000 --> 0:06:47,000
How can we find a treatment for compulsive overeating

128
0:06:48.278,000 --> 0:06:5,000
without messing up the hunger-driven feeding

129
0:06:50.35,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that we need to survive?

130
0:06:52.5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
The first step is to understand

131
0:06:54.509,000 --> 0:06:57,000
how the brain gives rise to feeding behavior.

132
0:06:58.165,000 --> 0:07:02,000
This fully-fed mouse is just exploring a space

133
0:07:02.474,000 --> 0:07:04,000
completely devoid of any food.

134
0:07:05.736,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Here we're using optogenetics to target neurons living in the hypothalamus,

135
0:07:09.292,000 --> 0:07:12,000
sending messages down wires aimed at the midbrain.

136
0:07:13.736,000 --> 0:07:16,000
When I turn the light on, right here,

137
0:07:17.141,000 --> 0:07:2,000
you can see that the mouse immediately begins licking the floor.

138
0:07:20.847,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

139
0:07:25.048,000 --> 0:07:27,000
This seemingly frenzied behavior

140
0:07:27.167,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is about to escalate into something I find really incredible.

141
0:07:31.151,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It's kind of trippy, actually.

142
0:07:33.532,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Ready?

143
0:07:35.006,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It's right here.

144
0:07:37.856,000 --> 0:07:4,000
See, he picks up his hands as if he is eating a piece of food,

145
0:07:41.744,000 --> 0:07:43,000
but there's nothing there, he's not holding anything.

146
0:07:44.269,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So this circuit is sufficient to drive feeding behavior

147
0:07:48.388,000 --> 0:07:49,000
in the absence of hunger,

148
0:07:50.15,000 --> 0:07:52,000
even in the absence of food.

149
0:07:53.53,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I can't know for sure how this mouse is feeling,

150
0:07:56.209,000 --> 0:07:59,000
but I speculate these neurons drive craving

151
0:07:59.298,000 --> 0:08:02,000
based on the behaviors we elicit when we target this pathway.

152
0:08:04.655,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Turn the light back off --

153
0:08:06.441,000 --> 0:08:07,000
animal's back to normal.

154
0:08:08.743,000 --> 0:08:1,000
When we silence this pathway,

155
0:08:11.735,000 --> 0:08:14,000
we can suppress and reduce compulsive overeating

156
0:08:15.156,000 --> 0:08:17,000
without altering hunger-driven feeding.

157
0:08:20.593,000 --> 0:08:22,000
What did you take away from these two videos

158
0:08:22.688,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that I just showed you?

159
0:08:23.96,000 --> 0:08:26,000
That making a very specific change to neural circuits in the brain

160
0:08:27.936,000 --> 0:08:29,000
can have specific changes to behavior.

161
0:08:30.761,000 --> 0:08:33,000
That every conscious experience that we have

162
0:08:34.268,000 --> 0:08:36,000
is governed by cells in our brain.

163
0:08:39.085,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I am the daughter of a physicist and a biologist,

164
0:08:42.807,000 --> 0:08:45,000
who literally met on the boat coming to America

165
0:08:45.919,000 --> 0:08:46,000
in pursuit of an education.

166
0:08:48.714,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So naturally,

167
0:08:49.898,000 --> 0:08:52,000
since there was "no pressure" to be a scientist ...

168
0:08:53.08,000 --> 0:08:56,000
(Laughter)

169
0:08:56.27,000 --> 0:08:57,000
as a college student,

170
0:08:57.473,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I had to decide whether I wanted to focus on psychology, the study of the mind,

171
0:09:02.458,000 --> 0:09:04,000
or neuroscience, the study of the brain.

172
0:09:04.969,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And I chose neuroscience,

173
0:09:06.522,000 --> 0:09:08,000
because I wanted to understand how the mind is born

174
0:09:09.416,000 --> 0:09:1,000
out of biological tissue.

175
0:09:11.296,000 --> 0:09:13,000
But really, I've come full circle to do both.

176
0:09:13.907,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And now my research program

177
0:09:15.669,000 --> 0:09:17,000
bridges the gap between the mind and the brain.

178
0:09:19.315,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Research from my laboratory

179
0:09:20.633,000 --> 0:09:23,000
suggests that we can begin to tie specific neural circuits

180
0:09:24.204,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to emotional states.

181
0:09:26.053,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And we have found a number of circuits

182
0:09:27.921,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that control anxiety-related behavior,

183
0:09:30.546,000 --> 0:09:31,000
compulsive overeating,

184
0:09:32.046,000 --> 0:09:34,000
social interaction, avoidance

185
0:09:34.712,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and many other types of motivated behaviors

186
0:09:36.797,000 --> 0:09:39,000
that may reflect internal emotional states.

187
0:09:41.899,000 --> 0:09:45,000
We used to think of functions of the mind as being defined by brain regions.

188
0:09:46.81,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But my work shows that within a given brain region,

189
0:09:49.215,000 --> 0:09:51,000
there are many different neurons doing different things.

190
0:09:52.414,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And these functions are partly defined by the paths they take.

191
0:09:58.033,000 --> 0:10:,000
Here's a metaphor to help illustrate

192
0:10:00.256,000 --> 0:10:03,000
how these discoveries change the way that we think about the brain.

193
0:10:05.069,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Let's say that the brain is analogous to the world

194
0:10:08.831,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and that neurons are analogous to people.

195
0:10:11.458,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And we want to understand how information is transmitted across the planet.

196
0:10:17.073,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Sure, it's useful to know

197
0:10:18.843,000 --> 0:10:21,000
where a given person is located when recording what they're saying.

198
0:10:22.581,000 --> 0:10:24,000
But I would argue that it's equally important

199
0:10:24.743,000 --> 0:10:26,000
to know who this person is talking to,

200
0:10:27.688,000 --> 0:10:28,000
who is listening

201
0:10:29.307,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and how the people listening respond to the information that they receive.

202
0:10:34.3,000 --> 0:10:36,000
The current state of mental health treatment

203
0:10:36.474,000 --> 0:10:38,000
is essentially a strategy of trial and error.

204
0:10:40.236,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And it is not working.

205
0:10:43.22,000 --> 0:10:46,000
The development of new drug therapies for mental health disorders

206
0:10:46.824,000 --> 0:10:47,000
has hit a brick wall,

207
0:10:48.173,000 --> 0:10:52,000
with scarcely any real progress since the 1950s.

208
0:10:52.927,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So what does the future hold?

209
0:10:55.474,000 --> 0:10:56,000
In the near future,

210
0:10:56.831,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I expect to see a mental health treatment revolution,

211
0:11:00.117,000 --> 0:11:03,000
where we focus on specific neural circuits in the brain.

212
0:11:03.315,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Diagnoses will be made based on both behavioral symptoms

213
0:11:07.3,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and measurable brain activity.

214
0:11:10.339,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Further in the future,

215
0:11:12.355,000 --> 0:11:15,000
by combining our ability to make acute changes to the brain

216
0:11:15.678,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and get acute changes to behavior

217
0:11:17.728,000 --> 0:11:21,000
with our knowledge of synaptic plasticity to make more permanent changes,

218
0:11:22.077,000 --> 0:11:25,000
we could push the brain into a state of fixing itself

219
0:11:25.708,000 --> 0:11:27,000
by reprogramming neural circuits.

220
0:11:28.927,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Exposure therapy at the circuit level.

221
0:11:33.238,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Once we switch the brain into a state of self-healing,

222
0:11:36.405,000 --> 0:11:38,000
this could potentially have long-lasting effects

223
0:11:38.937,000 --> 0:11:4,000
with no side effects.

224
0:11:41.831,000 --> 0:11:44,000
I can envision a future where neural circuit reprogramming

225
0:11:45.355,000 --> 0:11:48,000
represents a potential cure, not just a treatment.

226
0:11:51.877,000 --> 0:11:53,000
OK, but what about right now?

227
0:11:55.702,000 --> 0:11:57,000
If from this very moment forward,

228
0:11:58.154,000 --> 0:12:,000
each and every one of you left this talk

229
0:12:00.514,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and truly believed that the mind comes entirely from cells in your brain,

230
0:12:06.173,000 --> 0:12:09,000
then we could immediately get rid of negative perceptions and stigmas

231
0:12:09.696,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that prevent so many people

232
0:12:11.014,000 --> 0:12:13,000
from getting the mental health support that they need.

233
0:12:13.998,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Mental health professionals,

234
0:12:15.395,000 --> 0:12:17,000
we're always thinking about what's the next new treatment.

235
0:12:18.395,000 --> 0:12:2,000
But before we can apply new treatments,

236
0:12:20.871,000 --> 0:12:22,000
we need people to feel comfortable seeking them.

237
0:12:24.522,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Imagine how dramatically we could reduce the rates of suicides

238
0:12:29.379,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and school shootings

239
0:12:30.839,000 --> 0:12:33,000
if everyone who needed mental health support actually got it.

240
0:12:36.486,000 --> 0:12:41,000
When we truly understand exactly how the mind comes from the brain,

241
0:12:41.637,000 --> 0:12:43,000
we will improve the lives of everyone

242
0:12:43.939,000 --> 0:12:45,000
who will have a mental illness in their lifetime --

243
0:12:46.637,000 --> 0:12:47,000
half the population --

244
0:12:48.468,000 --> 0:12:51,000
as well as everyone else with whom they share the world.

245
0:12:53.198,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Thank you.

246
0:12:54.373,000 --> 0:12:58,000
(Applause)

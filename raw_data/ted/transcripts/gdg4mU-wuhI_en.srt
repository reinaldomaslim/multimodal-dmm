1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Because I usually take the role

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
of trying to explain to people

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
how wonderful the new technologies

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that are coming along are going to be,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and I thought that, since I was among friends here,

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I would tell you what I really think

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and try to look back and try to understand

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
what is really going on here

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
with these amazing jumps in technology

10
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it.

11
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So I'm going to start out

12
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
by showing just one very boring technology slide.

13
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And then, so if you can just turn on the slide that's on.

14
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
This is just a random slide

15
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
that I picked out of my file.

16
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide,

17
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
but the general form of it.

18
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing

19
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
about the power of RISC microprocessors

20
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
versus the power of local area networks.

21
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And the interesting thing about it

22
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is that this slide,

23
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
like so many technology slides that we're used to,

24
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
is a sort of a straight line

25
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
on a semi-log curve.

26
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
In other words, every step here

27
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
represents an order of magnitude

28
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
in performance scale.

29
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And this is a new thing

30
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that we talk about technology

31
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
on semi-log curves.

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Something really weird is going on here.

33
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And that's basically what I'm going to be talking about.

34
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So, if you could bring up the lights.

35
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
If you could bring up the lights higher,

36
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
because I'm just going to use a piece of paper here.

37
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Now why do we draw technology curves

38
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
in semi-log curves?

39
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve

40
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
where, let's say, this is years,

41
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
this is time of some sort,

42
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and this is whatever measure of the technology

43
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that I'm trying to graph,

44
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
the graphs look sort of silly.

45
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
They sort of go like this.

46
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And they don't tell us much.

47
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Now if I graph, for instance,

48
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
some other technology, say transportation technology,

49
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
on a semi-log curve,

50
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
it would look very stupid, it would look like a flat line.

51
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But when something like this happens,

52
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
things are qualitatively changing.

53
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So if transportation technology

54
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology,

55
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
then the day after tomorrow,

56
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I would be able to get in a taxi cab

57
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.

58
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It's not moving like that.

59
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And there's nothing precedented

60
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
in the history of technology development

61
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
of this kind of self-feeding growth

62
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
where you go by orders of magnitude every few years.

63
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Now the question that I'd like to ask is,

64
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
if you look at these exponential curves,

65
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
they don't go on forever.

66
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Things just can't possibly keep changing

67
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
as fast as they are.

68
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
One of two things is going to happen.

69
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Either it's going to turn into a sort of classical S-curve like this,

70
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
until something totally different comes along,

71
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
or maybe it's going to do this.

72
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
That's about all it can do.

73
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Now I'm an optimist,

74
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
so I sort of think it's probably going to do something like that.

75
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
If so, that means that what we're in the middle of right now

76
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
is a transition.

77
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We're sort of on this line

78
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
in a transition from the way the world used to be

79
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to some new way that the world is.

80
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And so what I'm trying to ask, what I've been asking myself,

81
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
is what's this new way that the world is?

82
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
What's that new state that the world is heading toward?

83
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Because the transition seems very, very confusing

84
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
when we're right in the middle of it.

85
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Now when I was a kid growing up,

86
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
the future was kind of the year 2000,

87
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.

88
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Now here's a conference

89
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in which people talk about the future,

90
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000.

91
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It's about as far as we go out.

92
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So in other words, the future has kind of been shrinking

93
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
one year per year

94
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
for my whole lifetime.

95
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Now I think that the reason

96
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
is because we all feel

97
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that something's happening there.

98
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
That transition is happening. We can all sense it.

99
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And we know that it just doesn't make too much sense

100
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to think out 30, 50 years

101
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
because everything's going to be so different

102
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that a simple extrapolation of what we're doing

103
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
just doesn't make any sense at all.

104
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So what I would like to talk about

105
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
is what that could be,

106
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
what that transition could be that we're going through.

107
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Now in order to do that

108
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff

109
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that really has nothing to do

110
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
with technology and computers.

111
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Because I think the only way to understand this

112
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
is to really step back

113
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and take a long time scale look at things.

114
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So the time scale that I would like to look at this on

115
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is the time scale of life on Earth.

116
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So I think this picture makes sense

117
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
if you look at it a few billion years at a time.

118
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So if you go back

119
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
about two and a half billion years,

120
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
the Earth was this big, sterile hunk of rock

121
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
with a lot of chemicals floating around on it.

122
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And if you look at the way

123
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that the chemicals got organized,

124
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it.

125
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And I think that there's theories that are beginning to understand

126
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
about how it started with RNA,

127
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
but I'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it,

128
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
which is that, at that time,

129
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
there were little drops of oil floating around

130
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them.

131
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And some of those drops of oil

132
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
had a particular combination of chemicals in them

133
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside

134
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and grow the drops of oil.

135
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And those that were like that

136
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
started to split and divide.

137
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense,

138
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
those little drops of oil.

139
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But now those drops of oil weren't really alive, as we say it now,

140
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
because every one of them

141
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
was a little random recipe of chemicals.

142
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And every time it divided,

143
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
they got sort of unequal division

144
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
of the chemicals within them.

145
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And so every drop was a little bit different.

146
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
In fact, the drops that were different in a way

147
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that caused them to be better

148
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
at incorporating chemicals around them,

149
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more.

150
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So those tended to live longer,

151
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
get expressed more.

152
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Now that's sort of just a very simple

153
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
chemical form of life,

154
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
but when things got interesting

155
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
was when these drops

156
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
learned a trick about abstraction.

157
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Somehow by ways that we don't quite understand,

158
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
these little drops learned to write down information.

159
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
They learned to record the information

160
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that was the recipe of the cell

161
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
onto a particular kind of chemical

162
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
called DNA.

163
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So in other words, they worked out,

164
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
in this mindless sort of evolutionary way,

165
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
a form of writing that let them write down what they were,

166
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
so that that way of writing it down could get copied.

167
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
The amazing thing is that that way of writing

168
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
seems to have stayed steady

169
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
since it evolved two and a half billion years ago.

170
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
In fact the recipe for us, our genes,

171
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
is exactly that same code and that same way of writing.

172
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
In fact, every living creature is written

173
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
in exactly the same set of letters and the same code.

174
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
In fact, one of the things that I did

175
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
just for amusement purposes

176
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
is we can now write things in this code.

177
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And I've got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder,

178
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
which I try not to let the security people see at airports.

179
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Laughter)

180
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But this has in it --

181
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
what I did is I took this code --

182
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it --

183
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA

184
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and amplified it 10 to the 22 times.

185
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card,

186
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I have plenty for everyone in the room,

187
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and, in fact, everyone in the world,

188
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and it's right here.

189
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
(Laughter)

190
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
If I had really been a egotist,

191
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room.

192
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Laughter)

193
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So what was the next step?

194
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Writing down the DNA was an interesting step.

195
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And that caused these cells --

196
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that kept them happy for another billion years.

197
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But then there was another really interesting step

198
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
where things became completely different,

199
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information,

200
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
so that they began to get communities of cells.

201
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I don't know if you know this,

202
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
but bacteria can actually exchange DNA.

203
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Now that's why, for instance,

204
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
antibiotic resistance has evolved.

205
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin,

206
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information

207
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
with other bacteria,

208
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin,

209
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
because bacteria communicate.

210
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Now what this communication allowed

211
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
was communities to form

212
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that, in some sense, were in the same boat together;

213
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
they were synergistic.

214
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So they survived

215
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
or they failed together,

216
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
which means that if a community was very successful,

217
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
all the individuals in that community

218
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
were repeated more

219
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and they were favored by evolution.

220
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Now the transition point happened

221
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
when these communities got so close

222
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that, in fact, they got together

223
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community

224
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
together on one string of DNA.

225
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And so the next stage that's interesting in life

226
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
took about another billion years.

227
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And at that stage,

228
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
we have multi-cellular communities,

229
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
communities of lots of different types of cells,

230
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
working together as a single organism.

231
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And in fact, we're such a multi-cellular community.

232
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
We have lots of cells

233
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
that are not out for themselves anymore.

234
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Your skin cell is really useless

235
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
without a heart cell, muscle cell,

236
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
a brain cell and so on.

237
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So these communities began to evolve

238
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place

239
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
was no longer a cell,

240
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
but a community which we call an organism.

241
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Now the next step that happened

242
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
is within these communities.

243
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
These communities of cells,

244
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
again, began to abstract information.

245
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And they began building very special structures

246
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that did nothing but process information within the community.

247
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And those are the neural structures.

248
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So neurons are the information processing apparatus

249
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
that those communities of cells built up.

250
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And in fact, they began to get specialists in the community

251
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and special structures

252
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that were responsible for recording,

253
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
understanding, learning information.

254
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And that was the brains and the nervous system

255
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
of those communities.

256
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.

257
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Because at that point,

258
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
an individual --

259
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
learning could happen

260
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
within the time span of a single organism,

261
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
instead of over this evolutionary time span.

262
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
So an organism could, for instance,

263
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit

264
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it.

265
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
That could happen within the lifetime of a single organism,

266
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
whereas before they'd built these special information processing structures,

267
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that would have had to be learned evolutionarily

268
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
over hundreds of thousands of years

269
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit.

270
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
So that nervous system,

271
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
the fact that they built these special information structures,

272
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution.

273
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Because evolution could now happen within an individual.

274
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It could happen in learning time scales.

275
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
But then what happened

276
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
was the individuals worked out,

277
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
of course, tricks of communicating.

278
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And for example,

279
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
the most sophisticated version that we're aware of is human language.

280
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
It's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it.

281
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Here I have a very complicated, messy,

282
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
confused idea in my head.

283
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically,

284
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and hopefully constructing a similar messy, confused idea in your head

285
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that bears some analogy to it.

286
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But we're taking something very complicated,

287
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
turning it into sound, sequences of sounds,

288
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and producing something very complicated in your brain.

289
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So this allows us now

290
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
to begin to start functioning

291
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
as a single organism.

292
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And so, in fact, what we've done

293
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
is we, humanity,

294
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
have started abstracting out.

295
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
We're going through the same levels

296
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
that multi-cellular organisms have gone through --

297
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
abstracting out our methods of recording,

298
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
presenting, processing information.

299
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
So for example, the invention of language

300
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
was a tiny step in that direction.

301
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Telephony, computers,

302
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
videotapes, CD-ROMs and so on

303
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
are all our specialized mechanisms

304
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
that we've now built within our society

305
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
for handling that information.

306
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And it all connects us together

307
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
into something

308
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that is much bigger

309
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and much faster

310
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and able to evolve

311
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
than what we were before.

312
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So now, evolution can take place

313
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
on a scale of microseconds.

314
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And you saw Ty's little evolutionary example

315
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
where he sort of did a little bit of evolution

316
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
on the Convolution program right before your eyes.

317
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
So now we've speeded up the time scales once again.

318
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
So the first steps of the story that I told you about

319
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
took a billion years a piece.

320
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And the next steps,

321
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
like nervous systems and brains,

322
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
took a few hundred million years.

323
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Then the next steps, like language and so on,

324
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
took less than a million years.

325
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And these next steps, like electronics,

326
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
seem to be taking only a few decades.

327
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
The process is feeding on itself

328
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and becoming, I guess, autocatalytic is the word for it --

329
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
when something reinforces its rate of change.

330
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
The more it changes, the faster it changes.

331
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And I think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion of curve.

332
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
We're seeing this process feeding back on itself.

333
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Now I design computers for a living,

334
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and I know that the mechanisms

335
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
that I use to design computers

336
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
would be impossible

337
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
without recent advances in computers.

338
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
So right now, what I do

339
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
is I design objects at such complexity

340
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
that it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense.

341
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
I don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does.

342
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
There are billions of them.

343
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Instead, what I do

344
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and what the designers at Thinking Machines do

345
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
is we think at some level of abstraction

346
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and then we hand it to the machine

347
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do,

348
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
much farther and faster than we could ever do.

349
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And in fact, sometimes it takes it by methods

350
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
that we don't quite even understand.

351
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
One method that's particularly interesting

352
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
that I've been using a lot lately

353
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
is evolution itself.

354
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
So what we do

355
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
is we put inside the machine

356
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
a process of evolution

357
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
that takes place on the microsecond time scale.

358
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
So for example,

359
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
in the most extreme cases,

360
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
we can actually evolve a program

361
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
by starting out with random sequences of instructions.

362
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Say, "Computer, would you please make

363
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
a hundred million random sequences of instructions.

364
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions,

365
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
run all of those programs,

366
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted."

367
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
So in other words, I define what I wanted.

368
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Let's say I want to sort numbers,

369
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
as a simple example I've done it with.

370
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers.

371
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
So of course, random sequences of instructions

372
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
are very unlikely to sort numbers,

373
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
so none of them will really do it.

374
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
But one of them, by luck,

375
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
may put two numbers in the right order.

376
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And I say, "Computer,

377
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
would you please now take the 10 percent

378
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
of those random sequences that did the best job.

379
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Save those. Kill off the rest.

380
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And now let's reproduce

381
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
the ones that sorted numbers the best.

382
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And let's reproduce them by a process of recombination

383
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
analogous to sex."

384
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Take two programs and they produce children

385
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
by exchanging their subroutines,

386
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs.

387
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
So I've got now a new generation of programs

388
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
that are produced by combinations

389
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
of the programs that did a little bit better job.

390
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Say, "Please repeat that process."

391
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Score them again.

392
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Introduce some mutations perhaps.

393
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
And try that again and do that for another generation.

394
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds.

395
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
So I can do the equivalent

396
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
of millions of years of evolution on that

397
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
within the computer in a few minutes,

398
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
or in the complicated cases, in a few hours.

399
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
At the end of that, I end up with programs

400
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers.

401
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
In fact, they are programs that are much more efficient

402
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
than programs I could have ever written by hand.

403
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Now if I look at those programs,

404
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
I can't tell you how they work.

405
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
I've tried looking at them and telling you how they work.

406
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
They're obscure, weird programs.

407
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
But they do the job.

408
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
And in fact, I know, I'm very confident that they do the job

409
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
because they come from a line

410
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job.

411
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
In fact, their life depended on doing the job.

412
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
(Laughter)

413
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
I was riding in a 747

414
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
with Marvin Minsky once,

415
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
and he pulls out this card and says, "Oh look. Look at this.

416
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
It says, 'This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts

417
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
working together to make you a safe flight.'

418
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Doesn't that make you feel confident?"

419
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
(Laughter)

420
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
In fact, we know that the engineering process doesn't work very well

421
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
when it gets complicated.

422
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
So we're beginning to depend on computers

423
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
to do a process that's very different than engineering.

424
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
And it lets us produce things of much more complexity

425
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
than normal engineering lets us produce.

426
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
And yet, we don't quite understand the options of it.

427
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
So in a sense, it's getting ahead of us.

428
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
We're now using those programs

429
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
to make much faster computers

430
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
so that we'll be able to run this process much faster.

431
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
So it's feeding back on itself.

432
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
The thing is becoming faster

433
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
and that's why I think it seems so confusing.

434
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves.

435
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
We're taking off.

436
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
And what we are is we're at a point in time

437
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
which is analogous to when single-celled organisms

438
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
were turning into multi-celled organisms.

439
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
So we're the amoebas

440
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
and we can't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we're creating.

441
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
We're right at that point of transition.

442
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
But I think that there really is something coming along after us.

443
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
I think it's very haughty of us

444
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
to think that we're the end product of evolution.

445
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
And I think all of us here

446
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
are a part of producing

447
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
whatever that next thing is.

448
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
So lunch is coming along,

449
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
and I think I will stop at that point,

450
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:,000
before I get selected out.

451
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:03,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.745,000 --> 0:00:14,000
To give me an idea of how many of you here

2
0:00:14.974,000 --> 0:00:16,000
may find what I'm about to tell you

3
0:00:17.096,000 --> 0:00:18,000
of practical value,

4
0:00:18.721,000 --> 0:00:2,000
let me ask you please to raise your hands:

5
0:00:21.41,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Who here is either over 65 years old

6
0:00:24.977,000 --> 0:00:27,000
or hopes to live past age 65

7
0:00:28.746,000 --> 0:00:3,000
or has parents or grandparents who did live

8
0:00:31.691,000 --> 0:00:32,000
or have lived past 65,

9
0:00:33.658,000 --> 0:00:35,000
raise your hands please. (Laughter)

10
0:00:36.243,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Okay. You are the people to whom my talk

11
0:00:38.397,000 --> 0:00:4,000
will be of practical value. (Laughter)

12
0:00:40.831,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The rest of you

13
0:00:42.488,000 --> 0:00:43,000
won't find my talk personally relevant,

14
0:00:44.276,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but I think that you will still find the subject

15
0:00:46.19,000 --> 0:00:47,000
fascinating.

16
0:00:47.837,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I'm going to talk about growing older

17
0:00:49.469,000 --> 0:00:51,000
in traditional societies.

18
0:00:51.888,000 --> 0:00:53,000
This subject constitutes just one chapter

19
0:00:54.634,000 --> 0:00:56,000
of my latest book, which compares

20
0:00:57.225,000 --> 0:01:,000
traditional, small, tribal societies

21
0:01:00.442,000 --> 0:01:02,000
with our large, modern societies,

22
0:01:02.992,000 --> 0:01:03,000
with respect to many topics

23
0:01:04.617,000 --> 0:01:05,000
such as bringing up children,

24
0:01:06.476,000 --> 0:01:09,000
growing older, health, dealing with danger,

25
0:01:10.397,000 --> 0:01:12,000
settling disputes, religion

26
0:01:12.742,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and speaking more than one language.

27
0:01:15.533,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Those tribal societies, which constituted

28
0:01:18.09,000 --> 0:01:2,000
all human societies for most of human history,

29
0:01:21.075,000 --> 0:01:24,000
are far more diverse than are our modern,

30
0:01:24.369,000 --> 0:01:26,000
recent, big societies.

31
0:01:26.536,000 --> 0:01:28,000
All big societies that have governments,

32
0:01:28.899,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and where most people are strangers to each other,

33
0:01:31.165,000 --> 0:01:33,000
are inevitably similar to each other

34
0:01:33.513,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and different from tribal societies.

35
0:01:36.361,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments

36
0:01:39.672,000 --> 0:01:41,000
in how to run a human society.

37
0:01:42.221,000 --> 0:01:44,000
They constitute experiments from which we ourselves

38
0:01:45.028,000 --> 0:01:47,000
may be able to learn.

39
0:01:47.43,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Tribal societies shouldn't be scorned

40
0:01:49.45,000 --> 0:01:5,000
as primitive and miserable,

41
0:01:51.186,000 --> 0:01:53,000
but also they shouldn't be romanticized

42
0:01:53.557,000 --> 0:01:55,000
as happy and peaceful.

43
0:01:55.774,000 --> 0:01:57,000
When we learn of tribal practices,

44
0:01:58.033,000 --> 0:01:59,000
some of them will horrify us,

45
0:01:59.807,000 --> 0:02:01,000
but there are other tribal practices which,

46
0:02:02.357,000 --> 0:02:03,000
when we hear about them,

47
0:02:03.706,000 --> 0:02:04,000
we may admire and envy

48
0:02:05.653,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and wonder whether we could adopt those practices

49
0:02:07.877,000 --> 0:02:09,000
ourselves.

50
0:02:10.574,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Most old people in the U.S. end up living

51
0:02:13.661,000 --> 0:02:14,000
separately from their children

52
0:02:15.648,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and from most of their friends

53
0:02:17.154,000 --> 0:02:18,000
of their earlier years,

54
0:02:18.846,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly,

55
0:02:22.7,000 --> 0:02:24,000
whereas in traditional societies,

56
0:02:24.908,000 --> 0:02:26,000
older people instead live out their lives

57
0:02:27.742,000 --> 0:02:29,000
among their children, their other relatives,

58
0:02:29.908,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and their lifelong friends.

59
0:02:32.305,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Nevertheless, the treatment of the elderly

60
0:02:34.474,000 --> 0:02:37,000
varies enormously among traditional societies,

61
0:02:37.639,000 --> 0:02:39,000
from much worse to much better

62
0:02:39.82,000 --> 0:02:41,000
than in our modern societies.

63
0:02:42.778,000 --> 0:02:44,000
At the worst extreme, many traditional societies

64
0:02:45.575,000 --> 0:02:46,000
get rid of their elderly

65
0:02:47.388,000 --> 0:02:5,000
in one of four increasingly direct ways:

66
0:02:50.919,000 --> 0:02:51,000
by neglecting their elderly

67
0:02:52.582,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and not feeding or cleaning them until they die,

68
0:02:56.011,000 --> 0:02:59,000
or by abandoning them when the group moves,

69
0:02:59.065,000 --> 0:03:02,000
or by encouraging older people to commit suicide,

70
0:03:02.204,000 --> 0:03:05,000
or by killing older people.

71
0:03:05.249,000 --> 0:03:07,000
In which tribal societies do children

72
0:03:07.998,000 --> 0:03:09,000
abandon or kill their parents?

73
0:03:10.384,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It happens mainly under two conditions.

74
0:03:13.408,000 --> 0:03:15,000
One is in nomadic, hunter-gather societies

75
0:03:16.388,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that often shift camp

76
0:03:18.111,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and that are physically incapable

77
0:03:20.29,000 --> 0:03:23,000
of transporting old people who can't walk

78
0:03:23.413,000 --> 0:03:25,000
when the able-bodied younger people already

79
0:03:25.973,000 --> 0:03:26,000
have to carry their young children

80
0:03:27.908,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and all their physical possessions.

81
0:03:30.726,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The other condition is in societies

82
0:03:32.89,000 --> 0:03:35,000
living in marginal or fluctuating environments,

83
0:03:36.2,000 --> 0:03:38,000
such as the Arctic or deserts,

84
0:03:38.533,000 --> 0:03:4,000
where there are periodic food shortages,

85
0:03:41.117,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and occasionally there just isn't enough food

86
0:03:43.046,000 --> 0:03:45,000
to keep everyone alive.

87
0:03:45.526,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Whatever food is available has to be reserved

88
0:03:47.95,000 --> 0:03:51,000
for able-bodied adults and for children.

89
0:03:52.275,000 --> 0:03:54,000
To us Americans, it sounds horrible

90
0:03:55.175,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to think of abandoning or killing

91
0:03:57.408,000 --> 0:03:59,000
your own sick wife or husband

92
0:03:59.589,000 --> 0:04:01,000
or elderly mother or father,

93
0:04:01.888,000 --> 0:04:04,000
but what could those traditional societies

94
0:04:05.647,000 --> 0:04:06,000
do differently?

95
0:04:07.13,000 --> 0:04:1,000
They face a cruel situation of no choice.

96
0:04:10.95,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Their old people had to do it to their own parents,

97
0:04:13.945,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and the old people know

98
0:04:15.233,000 --> 0:04:18,000
what now is going to happen to them.

99
0:04:18.384,000 --> 0:04:19,000
At the opposite extreme

100
0:04:20.198,000 --> 0:04:22,000
in treatment of the elderly, the happy extreme,

101
0:04:22.877,000 --> 0:04:23,000
are the New Guinea farming societies

102
0:04:24.864,000 --> 0:04:26,000
where I've been doing my fieldwork for the past 50 years,

103
0:04:27.861,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and most other sedentary traditional societies

104
0:04:31.108,000 --> 0:04:33,000
around the world.

105
0:04:33.194,000 --> 0:04:35,000
In those societies, older people are cared for.

106
0:04:36.142,000 --> 0:04:38,000
They are fed. They remain valuable.

107
0:04:38.492,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And they continue to live in the same hut

108
0:04:40.68,000 --> 0:04:42,000
or else in a nearby hut near their children,

109
0:04:43.367,000 --> 0:04:46,000
relatives and lifelong friends.

110
0:04:47.266,000 --> 0:04:49,000
There are two main sets of reasons for this variation

111
0:04:49.698,000 --> 0:04:51,000
among societies in their treatment

112
0:04:52.053,000 --> 0:04:53,000
of old people.

113
0:04:53.45,000 --> 0:04:54,000
The variation depends especially

114
0:04:55.087,000 --> 0:04:57,000
on the usefulness of old people

115
0:04:57.357,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and on the society's values.

116
0:05:00.07,000 --> 0:05:02,000
First, as regards usefulness,

117
0:05:02.393,000 --> 0:05:05,000
older people continue to perform useful services.

118
0:05:05.848,000 --> 0:05:07,000
One use of older people in traditional societies

119
0:05:08.533,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is that they often are still effective

120
0:05:10.533,000 --> 0:05:12,000
at producing food.

121
0:05:12.946,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Another traditional usefulness of older people

122
0:05:15.359,000 --> 0:05:18,000
is that they are capable of babysitting

123
0:05:18.638,000 --> 0:05:19,000
their grandchildren,

124
0:05:20.332,000 --> 0:05:22,000
thereby freeing up their own adult children,

125
0:05:23.002,000 --> 0:05:24,000
the parents of those grandchildren,

126
0:05:24.873,000 --> 0:05:27,000
to go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren.

127
0:05:28.346,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Still another traditional value of older people

128
0:05:30.551,000 --> 0:05:32,000
is in making tools, weapons, baskets,

129
0:05:33.471,000 --> 0:05:34,000
pots and textiles.

130
0:05:35.428,000 --> 0:05:38,000
In fact, they're usually the people who are best at it.

131
0:05:38.677,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Older people usually are the leaders

132
0:05:41.445,000 --> 0:05:42,000
of traditional societies,

133
0:05:43.294,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and the people most knowledgeable about politics,

134
0:05:46.553,000 --> 0:05:49,000
medicine, religion, songs and dances.

135
0:05:50.552,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Finally, older people in traditional societies

136
0:05:53.004,000 --> 0:05:56,000
have a huge significance that would never occur

137
0:05:56.931,000 --> 0:05:59,000
to us in our modern, literate societies,

138
0:06:00.607,000 --> 0:06:02,000
where our sources of information are books

139
0:06:03.022,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and the Internet.

140
0:06:04.706,000 --> 0:06:07,000
In contrast, in traditional societies without writing,

141
0:06:08.129,000 --> 0:06:11,000
older people are the repositories of information.

142
0:06:11.815,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It's their knowledge that spells the difference

143
0:06:14.38,000 --> 0:06:17,000
between survival and death for their whole society

144
0:06:18.13,000 --> 0:06:21,000
in a time of crisis caused by rare events

145
0:06:21.388,000 --> 0:06:23,000
for which only the oldest people alive

146
0:06:23.983,000 --> 0:06:25,000
have had experience.

147
0:06:26.272,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Those, then, are the ways in which older people

148
0:06:28.742,000 --> 0:06:3,000
are useful in traditional societies.

149
0:06:31.645,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Their usefulness varies and contributes

150
0:06:34.207,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to variation in the society's treatment

151
0:06:36.825,000 --> 0:06:38,000
of the elderly.

152
0:06:38.825,000 --> 0:06:39,000
The other set of reasons for variation

153
0:06:40.644,000 --> 0:06:41,000
in the treatment of the elderly is

154
0:06:42.519,000 --> 0:06:45,000
the society's cultural values.

155
0:06:45.754,000 --> 0:06:47,000
For example, there's particular emphasis

156
0:06:47.78,000 --> 0:06:5,000
on respect for the elderly in East Asia,

157
0:06:50.989,000 --> 0:06:52,000
associated with Confucius' doctrine

158
0:06:53.9,000 --> 0:06:56,000
of filial piety, which means obedience,

159
0:06:57.45,000 --> 0:07:01,000
respect and support for elderly parents.

160
0:07:01.544,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Cultural values that emphasize respect for older people

161
0:07:05.257,000 --> 0:07:07,000
contrast with the low status of the elderly

162
0:07:08.074,000 --> 0:07:1,000
in the U.S.

163
0:07:10.236,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Older Americans are at a big disadvantage

164
0:07:12.794,000 --> 0:07:14,000
in job applications.

165
0:07:14.907,000 --> 0:07:16,000
They're at a big disadvantage in hospitals.

166
0:07:17.442,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Our hospitals have an explicit policy

167
0:07:20.065,000 --> 0:07:24,000
called age-based allocation of healthcare resources.

168
0:07:25.032,000 --> 0:07:27,000
That sinister expression means that

169
0:07:27.805,000 --> 0:07:29,000
if hospital resources are limited,

170
0:07:30.011,000 --> 0:07:32,000
for example if only one donor heart

171
0:07:32.061,000 --> 0:07:34,000
becomes available for transplant,

172
0:07:34.359,000 --> 0:07:36,000
or if a surgeon has time to operate

173
0:07:36.461,000 --> 0:07:38,000
on only a certain number of patients,

174
0:07:38.972,000 --> 0:07:4,000
American hospitals have an explicit policy

175
0:07:41.922,000 --> 0:07:43,000
of giving preference to younger patients

176
0:07:44.242,000 --> 0:07:45,000
over older patients

177
0:07:45.722,000 --> 0:07:48,000
on the grounds that younger patients are considered

178
0:07:48.966,000 --> 0:07:49,000
more valuable to society

179
0:07:50.783,000 --> 0:07:52,000
because they have more years of life ahead of them,

180
0:07:53.428,000 --> 0:07:55,000
even though the younger patients have fewer years

181
0:07:56.088,000 --> 0:07:59,000
of valuable life experience behind them.

182
0:08:00.07,000 --> 0:08:02,000
There are several reasons for this low status

183
0:08:02.298,000 --> 0:08:04,000
of the elderly in the U.S.

184
0:08:04.64,000 --> 0:08:07,000
One is our Protestant work ethic

185
0:08:07.825,000 --> 0:08:09,000
which places high value on work,

186
0:08:10.138,000 --> 0:08:12,000
so older people who are no longer working

187
0:08:12.361,000 --> 0:08:13,000
aren't respected.

188
0:08:14.344,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Another reason is our American emphasis

189
0:08:17.201,000 --> 0:08:2,000
on the virtues of self-reliance and independence,

190
0:08:20.584,000 --> 0:08:23,000
so we instinctively look down on older people

191
0:08:23.653,000 --> 0:08:26,000
who are no longer self-reliant and independent.

192
0:08:27.25,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Still a third reason is our American cult of youth,

193
0:08:31.351,000 --> 0:08:33,000
which shows up even in our advertisements.

194
0:08:34.159,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Ads for Coca-Cola and beer always depict

195
0:08:37.423,000 --> 0:08:38,000
smiling young people,

196
0:08:38.978,000 --> 0:08:39,000
even though old as well as young people

197
0:08:40.948,000 --> 0:08:42,000
buy and drink Coca-Cola and beer.

198
0:08:43.27,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Just think, what's the last time you saw

199
0:08:45.273,000 --> 0:08:47,000
a Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people

200
0:08:47.95,000 --> 0:08:49,000
85 years old? Never.

201
0:08:50.899,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Instead, the only American ads

202
0:08:52.705,000 --> 0:08:54,000
featuring white-haired old people

203
0:08:54.711,000 --> 0:08:57,000
are ads for retirement homes and pension planning.

204
0:08:58.576,000 --> 0:09:,000
Well, what has changed in the status

205
0:09:00.626,000 --> 0:09:01,000
of the elderly today

206
0:09:02.609,000 --> 0:09:05,000
compared to their status in traditional societies?

207
0:09:05.998,000 --> 0:09:06,000
There have been a few changes for the better

208
0:09:07.868,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and more changes for the worse.

209
0:09:10.073,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Big changes for the better

210
0:09:11.674,000 --> 0:09:13,000
include the fact that today we enjoy

211
0:09:13.825,000 --> 0:09:14,000
much longer lives,

212
0:09:15.809,000 --> 0:09:17,000
much better health in our old age,

213
0:09:18.103,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and much better recreational opportunities.

214
0:09:21.741,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Another change for the better is that we now have

215
0:09:24.011,000 --> 0:09:26,000
specialized retirement facilities

216
0:09:26.851,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and programs to take care of old people.

217
0:09:30.202,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality

218
0:09:33.07,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that we now have

219
0:09:34.759,000 --> 0:09:36,000
more old people and fewer young people

220
0:09:37.333,000 --> 0:09:39,000
than at any time in the past.

221
0:09:40.017,000 --> 0:09:41,000
That means that all those old people

222
0:09:41.768,000 --> 0:09:43,000
are more of a burden on the few young people,

223
0:09:44.193,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and that each old person has less individual value.

224
0:09:48.679,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Another big change for the worse in the status of the elderly

225
0:09:51.863,000 --> 0:09:53,000
is the breaking of social ties with age,

226
0:09:54.54,000 --> 0:09:55,000
because older people, their children,

227
0:09:56.384,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and their friends,

228
0:09:57.7,000 --> 0:09:59,000
all move and scatter independently of each other

229
0:10:00.55,000 --> 0:10:02,000
many times during their lives.

230
0:10:02.804,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We Americans move on the average

231
0:10:04.617,000 --> 0:10:05,000
every five years.

232
0:10:06.57,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Hence our older people are likely

233
0:10:08.601,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to end up living distant from their children

234
0:10:10.908,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and the friends of their youth.

235
0:10:13.711,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Yet another change for the worse in the status of the elderly

236
0:10:16.873,000 --> 0:10:19,000
is formal retirement from the workforce,

237
0:10:20.603,000 --> 0:10:22,000
carrying with it a loss of work friendships

238
0:10:23.353,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and a loss of the self-esteem associated with work.

239
0:10:27.493,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Perhaps the biggest change for the worse

240
0:10:29.978,000 --> 0:10:31,000
is that our elderly are objectively

241
0:10:32.851,000 --> 0:10:35,000
less useful than in traditional societies.

242
0:10:36.013,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Widespread literacy means that they are no longer

243
0:10:38.976,000 --> 0:10:4,000
useful as repositories of knowledge.

244
0:10:41.607,000 --> 0:10:42,000
When we want some information,

245
0:10:43.55,000 --> 0:10:45,000
we look it up in a book or we Google it

246
0:10:45.811,000 --> 0:10:48,000
instead of finding some old person to ask.

247
0:10:49.281,000 --> 0:10:51,000
The slow pace of technological change

248
0:10:51.368,000 --> 0:10:52,000
in traditional societies

249
0:10:53.19,000 --> 0:10:55,000
means that what someone learns there as a child

250
0:10:56.04,000 --> 0:10:58,000
is still useful when that person is old,

251
0:10:58.699,000 --> 0:11:01,000
but the rapid pace of technological change today

252
0:11:02.302,000 --> 0:11:04,000
means that what we learn as children

253
0:11:04.369,000 --> 0:11:06,000
is no longer useful 60 years later.

254
0:11:07.259,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And conversely, we older people are not fluent

255
0:11:09.638,000 --> 0:11:12,000
in the technologies essential for surviving

256
0:11:12.672,000 --> 0:11:13,000
in modern society.

257
0:11:14.643,000 --> 0:11:16,000
For example, as a 15-year-old,

258
0:11:16.816,000 --> 0:11:19,000
I was considered outstandingly good at multiplying numbers

259
0:11:20.406,000 --> 0:11:23,000
because I had memorized the multiplication tables

260
0:11:23.601,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and I know how to use logarithms

261
0:11:25.746,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and I'm quick at manipulating a slide rule.

262
0:11:28.609,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Today, though, those skills are utterly useless

263
0:11:31.695,000 --> 0:11:33,000
because any idiot

264
0:11:34.066,000 --> 0:11:36,000
can now multiply eight-digit numbers

265
0:11:36.424,000 --> 0:11:39,000
accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator.

266
0:11:39.611,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Conversely, I at age 75

267
0:11:41.781,000 --> 0:11:43,000
am incompetent at skills

268
0:11:44.445,000 --> 0:11:46,000
essential for everyday life.

269
0:11:46.899,000 --> 0:11:48,000
My family's first TV set in 1948

270
0:11:49.683,000 --> 0:11:52,000
had only three knobs that I quickly mastered:

271
0:11:52.736,000 --> 0:11:54,000
an on-off switch, a volume knob,

272
0:11:55.486,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and a channel selector knob.

273
0:11:57.707,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Today, just to watch a program

274
0:11:59.795,000 --> 0:12:01,000
on the TV set in my own house,

275
0:12:02.251,000 --> 0:12:05,000
I have to operate a 41-button TV remote

276
0:12:05.968,000 --> 0:12:06,000
that utterly defeats me.

277
0:12:07.95,000 --> 0:12:1,000
I have to telephone my 25-year-old sons

278
0:12:10.964,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and ask them to talk me through it

279
0:12:13.161,000 --> 0:12:17,000
while I try to push those wretched 41 buttons.

280
0:12:18.158,000 --> 0:12:2,000
What can we do to improve the lives of the elderly

281
0:12:20.805,000 --> 0:12:23,000
in the U.S., and to make better use of their value?

282
0:12:24.259,000 --> 0:12:25,000
That's a huge problem.

283
0:12:26.033,000 --> 0:12:28,000
In my remaining four minutes today,

284
0:12:28.504,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I can offer just a few suggestions.

285
0:12:31.081,000 --> 0:12:32,000
One value of older people is that they are

286
0:12:33.003,000 --> 0:12:36,000
increasingly useful as grandparents

287
0:12:36.447,000 --> 0:12:38,000
for offering high-quality childcare

288
0:12:38.954,000 --> 0:12:4,000
to their grandchildren, if they choose to do it,

289
0:12:41.607,000 --> 0:12:43,000
as more young women enter the workforce

290
0:12:44.456,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and as fewer young parents of either gender

291
0:12:46.79,000 --> 0:12:49,000
stay home as full-time caretakers of their children.

292
0:12:50.45,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Compared to the usual alternatives

293
0:12:52.486,000 --> 0:12:55,000
of paid babysitters and day care centers,

294
0:12:56.084,000 --> 0:12:59,000
grandparents offer superior, motivated,

295
0:12:59.211,000 --> 0:13:01,000
experienced child care.

296
0:13:01.899,000 --> 0:13:04,000
They've already gained experience from raising their own children.

297
0:13:05.165,000 --> 0:13:07,000
They usually love their grandchildren,

298
0:13:07.509,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and are eager to spend time with them.

299
0:13:10.174,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Unlike other caregivers,

300
0:13:12.075,000 --> 0:13:14,000
grandparents don't quit their job

301
0:13:14.972,000 --> 0:13:16,000
because they found another job with higher pay

302
0:13:17.408,000 --> 0:13:2,000
looking after another baby.

303
0:13:20.921,000 --> 0:13:22,000
A second value of older people is paradoxically

304
0:13:23.325,000 --> 0:13:25,000
related to their loss of value

305
0:13:25.986,000 --> 0:13:29,000
as a result of changing world conditions and technology.

306
0:13:30.059,000 --> 0:13:32,000
At the same time, older people have gained

307
0:13:32.095,000 --> 0:13:34,000
in value today precisely because

308
0:13:34.406,000 --> 0:13:37,000
of their unique experience of living conditions

309
0:13:37.515,000 --> 0:13:38,000
that have now become rare

310
0:13:39.234,000 --> 0:13:42,000
because of rapid change, but that could come back.

311
0:13:42.544,000 --> 0:13:44,000
For example, only Americans now in their 70s

312
0:13:45.498,000 --> 0:13:47,000
or older today can remember

313
0:13:47.758,000 --> 0:13:5,000
the experience of living through a great depression,

314
0:13:51.086,000 --> 0:13:53,000
the experience of living through a world war,

315
0:13:53.724,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and agonizing whether or not

316
0:13:56.27,000 --> 0:13:59,000
dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible

317
0:13:59.307,000 --> 0:14:03,000
than the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs.

318
0:14:03.42,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Most of our current voters and politicians

319
0:14:05.696,000 --> 0:14:07,000
have no personal experience of any of those things,

320
0:14:08.428,000 --> 0:14:1,000
but millions of older Americans do.

321
0:14:11.123,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Unfortunately, all of those terrible situations

322
0:14:13.774,000 --> 0:14:14,000
could come back.

323
0:14:15.161,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Even if they don't come back,

324
0:14:16.467,000 --> 0:14:18,000
we have to be able to plan for them

325
0:14:18.659,000 --> 0:14:2,000
on the basis of the experience of what they were like.

326
0:14:21.47,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Older people have that experience.

327
0:14:23.304,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Younger people don't.

328
0:14:25.357,000 --> 0:14:26,000
The remaining value of older people

329
0:14:26.877,000 --> 0:14:28,000
that I'll mention involves recognizing that

330
0:14:29.32,000 --> 0:14:31,000
while there are many things that older people

331
0:14:31.9,000 --> 0:14:32,000
can no longer do,

332
0:14:33.506,000 --> 0:14:34,000
there are other things that they can do

333
0:14:34.995,000 --> 0:14:36,000
better than younger people.

334
0:14:37.09,000 --> 0:14:39,000
A challenge for society is to make use of those things

335
0:14:39.986,000 --> 0:14:41,000
that older people are better at doing.

336
0:14:42.458,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Some abilities, of course, decrease with age.

337
0:14:45.707,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Those include abilities at tasks

338
0:14:48.345,000 --> 0:14:51,000
requiring physical strength and stamina,

339
0:14:51.916,000 --> 0:14:54,000
ambition, and the power of novel reasoning

340
0:14:55.04,000 --> 0:14:57,000
in a circumscribed situation,

341
0:14:57.465,000 --> 0:14:59,000
such as figuring out the structure of DNA,

342
0:15:00.053,000 --> 0:15:03,000
best left to scientists under the age of 30.

343
0:15:03.954,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Conversely, valuable attributes

344
0:15:05.603,000 --> 0:15:08,000
that increase with age include experience,

345
0:15:09.149,000 --> 0:15:12,000
understanding of people and human relationships,

346
0:15:12.162,000 --> 0:15:14,000
ability to help other people

347
0:15:14.453,000 --> 0:15:16,000
without your own ego getting in the way,

348
0:15:16.881,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases,

349
0:15:20.406,000 --> 0:15:22,000
such as economics and comparative history,

350
0:15:23.231,000 --> 0:15:26,000
best left to scholars over the age of 60.

351
0:15:26.445,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Hence older people are much better than younger people

352
0:15:28.917,000 --> 0:15:31,000
at supervising, administering, advising,

353
0:15:32.888,000 --> 0:15:35,000
strategizing, teaching, synthesizing,

354
0:15:36.37,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and devising long-term plans.

355
0:15:39.076,000 --> 0:15:41,000
I've seen this value of older people

356
0:15:41.096,000 --> 0:15:43,000
with so many of my friends in their 60s,

357
0:15:43.668,000 --> 0:15:44,000
70s, 80s and 90s,

358
0:15:45.658,000 --> 0:15:48,000
who are still active as investment managers,

359
0:15:48.943,000 --> 0:15:51,000
farmers, lawyers and doctors.

360
0:15:51.956,000 --> 0:15:53,000
In short, many traditional societies

361
0:15:54.086,000 --> 0:15:56,000
make better use of their elderly

362
0:15:56.199,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and give their elderly more satisfying lives

363
0:15:59.309,000 --> 0:16:01,000
than we do in modern, big societies.

364
0:16:02.159,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Paradoxically nowadays,

365
0:16:04.024,000 --> 0:16:06,000
when we have more elderly people than ever before,

366
0:16:06.95,000 --> 0:16:08,000
living healthier lives and with better medical care

367
0:16:09.671,000 --> 0:16:1,000
than ever before,

368
0:16:11.157,000 --> 0:16:13,000
old age is in some respects more miserable

369
0:16:13.864,000 --> 0:16:14,000
than ever before.

370
0:16:15.631,000 --> 0:16:17,000
The lives of the elderly are widely recognized

371
0:16:18.053,000 --> 0:16:2,000
as constituting a disaster area

372
0:16:20.82,000 --> 0:16:22,000
of modern American society.

373
0:16:23.353,000 --> 0:16:24,000
We can surely do better by learning

374
0:16:25.034,000 --> 0:16:26,000
from the lives of the elderly

375
0:16:26.909,000 --> 0:16:28,000
in traditional societies.

376
0:16:28.921,000 --> 0:16:29,000
But what's true of the lives of the elderly

377
0:16:30.863,000 --> 0:16:31,000
in traditional societies

378
0:16:32.327,000 --> 0:16:33,000
is true of many other features

379
0:16:34.022,000 --> 0:16:36,000
of traditional societies as well.

380
0:16:36.616,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Of course, I'm not advocating that we all give up

381
0:16:39.205,000 --> 0:16:41,000
agriculture and metal tools

382
0:16:41.32,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

383
0:16:44.404,000 --> 0:16:45,000
There are many obvious respects

384
0:16:45.948,000 --> 0:16:47,000
in which our lives today are far happier

385
0:16:48.427,000 --> 0:16:51,000
than those in small, traditional societies.

386
0:16:51.489,000 --> 0:16:52,000
To mention just a few examples,

387
0:16:53.195,000 --> 0:16:55,000
our lives are longer, materially much richer,

388
0:16:56.165,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and less plagued by violence

389
0:16:58.448,000 --> 0:17:01,000
than are the lives of people in traditional societies.

390
0:17:01.676,000 --> 0:17:03,000
But there are also things to be admired

391
0:17:04.204,000 --> 0:17:06,000
about people in traditional societies,

392
0:17:06.346,000 --> 0:17:08,000
and perhaps to be learned from them.

393
0:17:08.665,000 --> 0:17:1,000
Their lives are usually socially much richer

394
0:17:11.256,000 --> 0:17:12,000
than our lives,

395
0:17:12.848,000 --> 0:17:14,000
although materially poorer.

396
0:17:15.14,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Their children are more self-confident,

397
0:17:18.092,000 --> 0:17:2,000
more independent, and more socially skilled

398
0:17:20.686,000 --> 0:17:22,000
than are our children.

399
0:17:23.022,000 --> 0:17:26,000
They think more realistically about dangers than we do.

400
0:17:26.765,000 --> 0:17:29,000
They almost never die of diabetes, heart disease,

401
0:17:30.294,000 --> 0:17:33,000
stroke, and the other noncommunicable diseases

402
0:17:33.528,000 --> 0:17:35,000
that will be the causes of death of almost

403
0:17:36.04,000 --> 0:17:39,000
all of us in this room today.

404
0:17:39.126,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Features of the modern lifestyle predispose us to those diseases,

405
0:17:43.136,000 --> 0:17:45,000
and features of the traditional lifestyle

406
0:17:45.37,000 --> 0:17:47,000
protect us against them.

407
0:17:47.877,000 --> 0:17:49,000
Those are just some examples of what we can learn

408
0:17:50.036,000 --> 0:17:52,000
from traditional societies.

409
0:17:52.324,000 --> 0:17:53,000
I hope that you will find it as fascinating

410
0:17:54.211,000 --> 0:17:56,000
to read about traditional societies

411
0:17:56.62,000 --> 0:17:58,000
as I found it to live in those societies.

412
0:17:59.323,000 --> 0:18:01,000
Thank you.

413
0:18:01.503,000 --> 0:18:05,000
(Applause)

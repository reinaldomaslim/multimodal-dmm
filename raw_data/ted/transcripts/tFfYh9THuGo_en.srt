1
0:00:12.873,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Take a moment

2
0:00:14.319,000 --> 0:00:15,000
and think about a virus.

3
0:00:16.913,000 --> 0:00:17,000
What comes to your mind?

4
0:00:18.73,000 --> 0:00:19,000
An illness?

5
0:00:20.007,000 --> 0:00:21,000
A fear?

6
0:00:21.357,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Probably something really unpleasant.

7
0:00:23.387,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And yet, viruses are not all the same.

8
0:00:25.958,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It's true, some of them cause devastating disease.

9
0:00:29.513,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But others can do the exact opposite -- they can cure disease.

10
0:00:33.624,000 --> 0:00:35,000
These viruses are called "phages."

11
0:00:36.125,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Now, the first time I heard about phages was back in 2013.

12
0:00:39.458,000 --> 0:00:41,000
My father-in-law, who's a surgeon,

13
0:00:41.633,000 --> 0:00:43,000
was telling me about a woman he was treating.

14
0:00:44.077,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The woman had a knee injury, required multiple surgeries,

15
0:00:47.22,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and over the course of these,

16
0:00:48.697,000 --> 0:00:5,000
developed a chronic bacterial infection in her leg.

17
0:00:51.593,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Unfortunately for her,

18
0:00:52.877,000 --> 0:00:55,000
the bacteria causing the infection also did not respond

19
0:00:55.934,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to any antibiotic that was available.

20
0:00:58.807,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So at this point, typically, the only option left is to amputate the leg

21
0:01:02.22,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to stop the infection from spreading further.

22
0:01:05.268,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now, my father-in-law was desperate for a different kind of solution,

23
0:01:08.823,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and he applied for an experimental, last-resort treatment using phages.

24
0:01:13.727,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And guess what? It worked.

25
0:01:15.617,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Within three weeks of applying the phages, the chronic infection had healed up,

26
0:01:19.807,000 --> 0:01:21,000
where before, no antibiotic was working.

27
0:01:22.998,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I was fascinated by this weird conception:

28
0:01:27.522,000 --> 0:01:29,000
viruses curing an infection.

29
0:01:30.617,000 --> 0:01:33,000
To this day, I am fascinated by the medical potential of phages.

30
0:01:34.117,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And I actually quit my job last year to build a company in this space.

31
0:01:38.76,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Now, what is a phage?

32
0:01:41.465,000 --> 0:01:44,000
The image that you see here was taken by an electron microscope.

33
0:01:45.195,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And that means what we see on the screen is in reality extremely tiny.

34
0:01:49.25,000 --> 0:01:52,000
The grainy thing in the middle with the head, the long body

35
0:01:53.041,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and a number of feet --

36
0:01:54.514,000 --> 0:01:56,000
this is the image of a prototypical phage.

37
0:01:57.228,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It's kind of cute.

38
0:01:58.474,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:00.958,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Now, take a look at your hand.

40
0:02:03.829,000 --> 0:02:07,000
In our team, we've estimated that you have more than 10 billion phages

41
0:02:08.099,000 --> 0:02:09,000
on each of your hands.

42
0:02:09.94,000 --> 0:02:1,000
What are they doing there?

43
0:02:11.702,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:12.974,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Well, viruses are good at infecting cells.

45
0:02:15.792,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And phages are great at infecting bacteria.

46
0:02:18.03,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And your hand, just like so much of our body,

47
0:02:20.482,000 --> 0:02:22,000
is a hotbed of bacterial activity,

48
0:02:22.942,000 --> 0:02:25,000
making it an ideal hunting ground for phages.

49
0:02:26.204,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Because after all, phages hunt bacteria.

50
0:02:29.91,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It's also important to know that phages are extremely selective hunters.

51
0:02:34.014,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Typically, a phage will only infect a single bacterial species.

52
0:02:38.648,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So in this rendering here, the phage that you see

53
0:02:41.664,000 --> 0:02:44,000
hunts for a bacterium called Staphylococcus aureus,

54
0:02:44.854,000 --> 0:02:47,000
which is known as MRSA in its drug-resistant form.

55
0:02:48.133,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It causes skin or wound infections.

56
0:02:51.069,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The way the phage hunts is with its feet.

57
0:02:54.364,000 --> 0:02:56,000
The feet are actually extremely sensitive receptors,

58
0:02:56.886,000 --> 0:02:58,000
on the lookout for the right surface on a bacterial cell.

59
0:03:00.158,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Once it finds it,

60
0:03:01.434,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the phage will latch on to the bacterial cell wall

61
0:03:04.387,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and then inject its DNA.

62
0:03:06.371,000 --> 0:03:07,000
DNA sits in the head of the phage

63
0:03:08.061,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and travels into the bacteria through the long body.

64
0:03:11.307,000 --> 0:03:13,000
At this point, the phage reprograms the bacteria

65
0:03:14.022,000 --> 0:03:16,000
into producing lots of new phages.

66
0:03:16.419,000 --> 0:03:18,000
The bacteria, in effect, becomes a phage factory.

67
0:03:19.704,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Once around 50-100 phages have accumulated within the bacteria cell,

68
0:03:23.688,000 --> 0:03:25,000
the phages are then able to release a protein

69
0:03:26.101,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that disrupts the bacteria cell wall.

70
0:03:28.514,000 --> 0:03:31,000
As the bacteria bursts, the phages move out

71
0:03:31.704,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and go on the hunt again for a new bacteria to infect.

72
0:03:35.371,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now, I'm sorry, this probably sounded like a scary virus again.

73
0:03:39.22,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But it's exactly this ability of phages --

74
0:03:41.887,000 --> 0:03:43,000
to multiply within the bacteria and then kill them --

75
0:03:44.602,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that make them so interesting from a medical point of view.

76
0:03:47.763,000 --> 0:03:49,000
The other part that I find extremely interesting

77
0:03:50.064,000 --> 0:03:52,000
is the scale at which this is going on.

78
0:03:52.342,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Now, just five years ago, I really had no clue about phages.

79
0:03:55.85,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And yet, today I would tell you they are part of a natural principle.

80
0:03:59.694,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Phages and bacteria go back to the earliest days of evolution.

81
0:04:03.726,000 --> 0:04:06,000
They have always existed in tandem, keeping each other in check.

82
0:04:07.765,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So this is really the story of yin and yang, of the hunter and the prey,

83
0:04:11.661,000 --> 0:04:12,000
at a microscopic level.

84
0:04:14.005,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Some scientists have even estimated

85
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that phages are the most abundant organism on our planet.

86
0:04:20.863,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So even before we continue talking about their medical potential,

87
0:04:23.958,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I think everybody should know about phages and their role on earth:

88
0:04:27.146,000 --> 0:04:29,000
they hunt, infect and kill bacteria.

89
0:04:30.55,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Now, how come we have something that works so well in nature,

90
0:04:33.535,000 --> 0:04:35,000
every day, everywhere around us,

91
0:04:35.95,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and yet, in most parts of the world,

92
0:04:37.728,000 --> 0:04:39,000
we do not have a single drug on the market

93
0:04:39.768,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that uses this principle to combat bacterial infections?

94
0:04:43.458,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The simple answer is: no one has developed this kind of a drug yet,

95
0:04:47.3,000 --> 0:04:5,000
at least not one that conforms to the Western regulatory standards

96
0:04:50.483,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that set the norm for so much of the world.

97
0:04:53.251,000 --> 0:04:55,000
To understand why, we need to move back in time.

98
0:04:57.298,000 --> 0:04:59,000
This is a picture of Félix d'Herelle.

99
0:04:59.52,000 --> 0:05:02,000
He is one of the two scientists credited with discovering phages.

100
0:05:02.99,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Except, when he discovered them back in 1917, he had no clue

101
0:05:06.77,000 --> 0:05:07,000
what he had discovered.

102
0:05:08.72,000 --> 0:05:11,000
He was interested in a disease called bacillary dysentery,

103
0:05:12.032,000 --> 0:05:14,000
which is a bacterial infection that causes severe diarrhea,

104
0:05:14.929,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and back then, was actually killing a lot of people,

105
0:05:17.397,000 --> 0:05:2,000
because after all, no cure for bacterial infections had been invented.

106
0:05:21.165,000 --> 0:05:24,000
He was looking at samples from patients who had survived this illness.

107
0:05:25.099,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And he found that something weird was going on.

108
0:05:27.356,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Something in the sample was killing the bacteria

109
0:05:29.736,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that were supposed to cause the disease.

110
0:05:31.95,000 --> 0:05:34,000
To find out what was going on, he did an ingenious experiment.

111
0:05:35.395,000 --> 0:05:37,000
He took the sample, filtered it

112
0:05:37.539,000 --> 0:05:4,000
until he was sure that only something very small could have remained,

113
0:05:40.818,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and then took a tiny drop and added it to freshly cultivated bacteria.

114
0:05:45.087,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And he observed that within a number of hours,

115
0:05:47.287,000 --> 0:05:48,000
the bacteria had been killed.

116
0:05:49.276,000 --> 0:05:52,000
He then repeated this, again filtering, taking a tiny drop,

117
0:05:53.077,000 --> 0:05:55,000
adding it to the next batch of fresh bacteria.

118
0:05:55.675,000 --> 0:05:57,000
He did this in sequence 50 times,

119
0:05:58.206,000 --> 0:05:59,000
always observing the same effect.

120
0:06:00.095,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And at this point, he made two conclusions.

121
0:06:02.841,000 --> 0:06:05,000
First of all, the obvious one: yes, something was killing the bacteria,

122
0:06:06.302,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and it was in that liquid.

123
0:06:07.822,000 --> 0:06:09,000
The other one: it had to be biologic in nature,

124
0:06:10.631,000 --> 0:06:13,000
because a tiny drop was sufficient to have a huge impact.

125
0:06:14.853,000 --> 0:06:17,000
He called the agent he had found an "invisible microbe"

126
0:06:18.101,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and gave it the name "bacteriophage,"

127
0:06:19.93,000 --> 0:06:21,000
which, literally translated, means "bacteria eater."

128
0:06:22.8,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And by the way, this is one of the most fundamental discoveries

129
0:06:25.816,000 --> 0:06:26,000
of modern microbiology.

130
0:06:27.149,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So many modern techniques go back to our understanding of how phages work --

131
0:06:31.387,000 --> 0:06:33,000
in genomic editing, but also in other fields.

132
0:06:33.705,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And just today, the Nobel Prize in chemistry was announced

133
0:06:36.688,000 --> 0:06:39,000
for two scientists who work with phages and develop drugs based on that.

134
0:06:41.631,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Now, back in the 1920s and 1930s,

135
0:06:43.782,000 --> 0:06:45,000
people also immediately saw the medical potential of phages.

136
0:06:46.719,000 --> 0:06:47,000
After all, albeit invisible,

137
0:06:48.402,000 --> 0:06:5,000
you had something that reliably was killing bacteria.

138
0:06:51.489,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Companies that still exist today, such as Abbott, Squibb or Lilly,

139
0:06:54.974,000 --> 0:06:55,000
sold phage preparations.

140
0:06:57.204,000 --> 0:07:,000
But the reality is, if you're starting with an invisible microbe,

141
0:07:00.284,000 --> 0:07:02,000
it's very difficult to get to a reliable drug.

142
0:07:03.117,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Just imagine going to the FDA today

143
0:07:05.133,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and telling them all about that invisible virus

144
0:07:07.463,000 --> 0:07:08,000
you want to give to patients.

145
0:07:09.752,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So when chemical antibiotics emerged in the 1940s,

146
0:07:12.696,000 --> 0:07:14,000
they completely changed the game.

147
0:07:14.811,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And this guy played a major role.

148
0:07:16.843,000 --> 0:07:17,000
This is Alexander Fleming.

149
0:07:18.161,000 --> 0:07:19,000
He won the Nobel Prize in medicine

150
0:07:19.994,000 --> 0:07:21,000
for his work contributing to the development

151
0:07:22.153,000 --> 0:07:23,000
of the first antibiotic, penicillin.

152
0:07:24.871,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And antibiotics really work very differently than phages.

153
0:07:29.022,000 --> 0:07:31,000
For the most part, they inhibit the growth of the bacteria,

154
0:07:31.823,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and they don't care so much which kind of bacteria are present.

155
0:07:35.196,000 --> 0:07:36,000
The ones that we call broad-spectrum

156
0:07:37.15,000 --> 0:07:4,000
will even work against a whole bunch of bacteria out there.

157
0:07:40.766,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Compare that to phages, which work extremely narrowly

158
0:07:43.284,000 --> 0:07:44,000
against one bacterial species,

159
0:07:44.751,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and you can see the obvious advantage.

160
0:07:47.575,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Now, back then, this must have felt like a dream come true.

161
0:07:50.45,000 --> 0:07:53,000
You had a patient with a suspected bacterial infection,

162
0:07:53.673,000 --> 0:07:54,000
you gave him the antibiotic,

163
0:07:55.292,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and without really needing to know anything else about the bacteria

164
0:07:58.475,000 --> 0:07:59,000
causing the disease,

165
0:07:59.673,000 --> 0:08:,000
many of the patients recovered.

166
0:08:01.212,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And so as we developed more and more antibiotics,

167
0:08:03.593,000 --> 0:08:06,000
they, rightly so, became the first-line therapy for bacterial infections.

168
0:08:07.831,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And by the way, they have contributed tremendously to our life expectancy.

169
0:08:12.093,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We are only able to do complex medical interventions

170
0:08:14.823,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and medical surgeries today

171
0:08:16.49,000 --> 0:08:17,000
because we have antibiotics,

172
0:08:17.887,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and we don't risk the patient dying the very next day

173
0:08:20.417,000 --> 0:08:23,000
from the bacterial infection that he might contract during the operation.

174
0:08:24.288,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So we started to forget about phages, especially in Western medicine.

175
0:08:28.638,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And to a certain extent, even when I was growing up, the notion was:

176
0:08:32.396,000 --> 0:08:35,000
we have solved bacterial infections; we have antibiotics.

177
0:08:37.185,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Of course, today, we know that this is wrong.

178
0:08:40.553,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Today, most of you will have heard about superbugs.

179
0:08:42.974,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Those are bacteria that have become resistant

180
0:08:45.135,000 --> 0:08:49,000
to many, if not all, of the antibiotics that we have developed

181
0:08:49.673,000 --> 0:08:5,000
to treat this infection.

182
0:08:51.76,000 --> 0:08:52,000
How did we get here?

183
0:08:53.118,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Well, we weren't as smart as we thought we were.

184
0:08:56.578,000 --> 0:08:58,000
As we started using antibiotics everywhere --

185
0:08:59.545,000 --> 0:09:02,000
in hospitals, to treat and prevent; at home, for simple colds;

186
0:09:02.958,000 --> 0:09:04,000
on farms, to keep animals healthy --

187
0:09:05.244,000 --> 0:09:06,000
the bacteria evolved.

188
0:09:07.509,000 --> 0:09:1,000
In the onslaught of antibiotics that were all around them,

189
0:09:11.382,000 --> 0:09:14,000
those bacteria survived that were best able to adapt.

190
0:09:15.017,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Today, we call these "multidrug-resistant bacteria."

191
0:09:18.283,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And let me put a scary number out there.

192
0:09:20.442,000 --> 0:09:22,000
In a recent study commissioned by the UK government,

193
0:09:22.919,000 --> 0:09:24,000
it was estimated that by 2050,

194
0:09:25.339,000 --> 0:09:29,000
ten million people could die every year from multidrug-resistant infections.

195
0:09:29.871,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Compare that to eight million deaths from cancer per year today,

196
0:09:33.038,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and you can see that this is a scary number.

197
0:09:35.792,000 --> 0:09:37,000
But the good news is, phages have stuck around.

198
0:09:39.014,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And let me tell you, they are not impressed by multidrug resistance.

199
0:09:42.244,000 --> 0:09:43,000
(Laughter)

200
0:09:43.419,000 --> 0:09:48,000
They are just as happily killing and hunting bacteria all around us.

201
0:09:50.028,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And they've also stayed selective, which today is really a good thing.

202
0:09:53.353,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Today, we are able to reliably identify a bacterial pathogen

203
0:09:56.861,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that's causing an infection in many settings.

204
0:09:59.379,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And their selectivity will help us avoid some of the side effects

205
0:10:02.501,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that are commonly associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

206
0:10:06.609,000 --> 0:10:09,000
But maybe the best news of all is: they are no longer an invisible microbe.

207
0:10:10.466,000 --> 0:10:11,000
We can look at them.

208
0:10:11.815,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And we did so together before.

209
0:10:13.284,000 --> 0:10:14,000
We can sequence their DNA.

210
0:10:15.156,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We understand how they replicate.

211
0:10:16.776,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And we understand the limitations.

212
0:10:18.688,000 --> 0:10:19,000
We are in a great place

213
0:10:20.079,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to now develop strong and reliable phage-based pharmaceuticals.

214
0:10:24.117,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And that's what's happening around the globe.

215
0:10:26.323,000 --> 0:10:28,000
More than 10 biotech companies, including our own company,

216
0:10:29.102,000 --> 0:10:32,000
are developing human-phage applications to treat bacterial infections.

217
0:10:32.711,000 --> 0:10:36,000
A number of clinical trials are getting underway in Europe and the US.

218
0:10:37.751,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So I'm convinced that we're standing on the verge

219
0:10:40.085,000 --> 0:10:41,000
of a renaissance of phage therapy.

220
0:10:42.069,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And to me, the correct way to depict the phage is something like this.

221
0:10:46.855,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Laughter)

222
0:10:49.371,000 --> 0:10:52,000
To me, phages are the superheroes that we have been waiting for

223
0:10:52.871,000 --> 0:10:55,000
in our fight against multidrug-resistant infections.

224
0:10:56.617,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So the next time you think about a virus,

225
0:10:59.149,000 --> 0:11:,000
keep this image in mind.

226
0:11:01.236,000 --> 0:11:03,000
After all, a phage might one day save your life.

227
0:11:04.81,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Thank you.

228
0:11:06.024,000 --> 0:11:11,000
(Applause)

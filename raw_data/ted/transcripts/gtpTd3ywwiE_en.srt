2
0:00:13.067,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I made a film that was impossible to make,

3
0:00:15.952,000 --> 0:00:18,000
but I didn't know it was impossible,

4
0:00:19.603,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and that's how I was able to do it.

5
0:00:22.395,000 --> 0:00:24,000
"Mars et Avril" is a science fiction film.

6
0:00:24.855,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It's set in Montreal some 50 years in the future.

7
0:00:29.053,000 --> 0:00:31,000
No one had done that kind of movie in Quebec before

8
0:00:31.255,000 --> 0:00:34,000
because it's expensive, it's set in the future,

9
0:00:34.937,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and it's got tons of visual effects,

10
0:00:36.597,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and it's shot on green screen.

11
0:00:39.028,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Yet this is the kind of movie that I wanted to make

12
0:00:41.179,000 --> 0:00:42,000
ever since I was a kid, really,

13
0:00:43.164,000 --> 0:00:45,000
back when I was reading some comic books

14
0:00:45.273,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and dreaming about what the future might be.

15
0:00:48.869,000 --> 0:00:5,000
When American producers see my film,

16
0:00:51.505,000 --> 0:00:54,000
they think that I had a big budget to do it,

17
0:00:54.789,000 --> 0:00:57,000
like 23 million.

18
0:00:57.908,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But in fact I had 10 percent of that budget.

19
0:01:00.894,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I did "Mars et Avril" for only 2.3 million.

20
0:01:03.443,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So you might wonder, what's the deal here?

21
0:01:04.539,000 --> 0:01:06,000
How did I do this?

22
0:01:07.092,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Well, it's two things. First, it's time.

23
0:01:10.329,000 --> 0:01:12,000
When you don't have money, you must take time,

24
0:01:13.11,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and it took me seven years to do "Mars et Avril."

25
0:01:17.002,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The second aspect is love.

26
0:01:20.332,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved.

27
0:01:23.87,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And it seems like every department had nothing,

28
0:01:26.04,000 --> 0:01:29,000
so they had to rely on our creativity

29
0:01:29.068,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and turn every problem into an opportunity.

30
0:01:31.642,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And that brings me to the point of my talk, actually,

31
0:01:33.668,000 --> 0:01:37,000
how constraints, big creative constraints, can boost creativity.

32
0:01:37.808,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But let me go back in time a bit.

33
0:01:41.216,000 --> 0:01:44,000
In my early 20s, I did some graphic novels,

34
0:01:44.373,000 --> 0:01:46,000
but they weren't your usual graphic novels.

35
0:01:46.407,000 --> 0:01:48,000
They were books telling a science fiction story

36
0:01:48.9,000 --> 0:01:5,000
through images and text,

37
0:01:51.605,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and most of the actors who are now starring

38
0:01:55.188,000 --> 0:01:57,000
in the movie adaptation, they were already involved

39
0:01:57.246,000 --> 0:02:,000
in these books portraying characters

40
0:02:00.84,000 --> 0:02:05,000
into a sort of experimental, theatrical, simplistic way.

41
0:02:06.387,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And one of these actors is the great stage director

42
0:02:10.09,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and actor Robert Lepage.

43
0:02:11.534,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And I just love this guy.

44
0:02:13.055,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I've been in love with this guy since I was a kid.

45
0:02:16.5,000 --> 0:02:18,000
His career I admire a lot.

46
0:02:19.303,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And I wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project,

47
0:02:22.236,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and he was kind enough to lend his image

48
0:02:26.396,000 --> 0:02:27,000
to the character of Eugène Spaak,

49
0:02:28.059,000 --> 0:02:32,000
who is a cosmologist and artist who seeks relation

50
0:02:32.681,000 --> 0:02:37,000
in between time, space, love, music and women.

51
0:02:38.151,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And he was a perfect fit for the part,

52
0:02:41.706,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and Robert is actually the one who gave me my first chance.

53
0:02:44.89,000 --> 0:02:46,000
He was the one who believed in me

54
0:02:47.226,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and encouraged me to do an adaptation of my books

55
0:02:50.803,000 --> 0:02:52,000
into a film, and to write, direct,

56
0:02:53.758,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and produce the film myself.

57
0:02:55.81,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And Robert is actually the very first example

58
0:02:59.62,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of how constraints can boost creativity.

59
0:03:03.504,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Because this guy is the busiest man on the planet.

60
0:03:06.171,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I mean, his agenda is booked until 2042,

61
0:03:09.294,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and he's really hard to get,

62
0:03:13.134,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and I wanted him to be in the movie,

63
0:03:16.017,000 --> 0:03:17,000
to reprise his role in the movie.

64
0:03:17.922,000 --> 0:03:19,000
But the thing is, had I waited

65
0:03:20.918,000 --> 0:03:22,000
for him until 2042, my film wouldn't be

66
0:03:23.47,000 --> 0:03:26,000
a futuristic film anymore, so I just couldn't do that. Right?

67
0:03:27.266,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But that's kind of a big problem.

68
0:03:28.95,000 --> 0:03:31,000
How do you get somebody who is too busy

69
0:03:32.243,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to star in a movie?

70
0:03:34.369,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Well, I said as a joke in a production meeting --

71
0:03:38.271,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and this is a true story, by the way —

72
0:03:40.016,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I said, "Why don't we turn this guy into a hologram?

73
0:03:42.928,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Because, you know, he is everywhere

74
0:03:45.091,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and nowhere on the planet at the same time,

75
0:03:46.957,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and he's an illuminated being in my mind,

76
0:03:49.528,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and he's in between reality and virtual reality,

77
0:03:53.782,000 --> 0:03:54,000
so it would make perfect sense

78
0:03:55.756,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to turn this guy into a hologram."

79
0:03:58.006,000 --> 0:04:,000
Everybody around the table laughed,

80
0:04:00.326,000 --> 0:04:02,000
but the joke was kind of a good solution,

81
0:04:02.862,000 --> 0:04:04,000
so that's what we ended up doing.

82
0:04:05.318,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Here's how we did it. We shot Robert with six cameras.

83
0:04:09.021,000 --> 0:04:11,000
He was dressed in green and he was like

84
0:04:11.463,000 --> 0:04:12,000
in a green aquarium.

85
0:04:13.207,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Each camera was covering 60 degrees of his head,

86
0:04:15.985,000 --> 0:04:17,000
so that in post-production we could use

87
0:04:18.598,000 --> 0:04:19,000
pretty much any angle we needed,

88
0:04:20.49,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and we shot only his head.

89
0:04:22.902,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Six months later there was a guy on set,

90
0:04:25.408,000 --> 0:04:26,000
a mime portraying the body,

91
0:04:27.238,000 --> 0:04:29,000
the vehicle for the head.

92
0:04:29.678,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And he was wearing a green hood

93
0:04:32.929,000 --> 0:04:35,000
so that we could erase the green hood in postproduction

94
0:04:36.111,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and replace it with Robert Lepage's head.

95
0:04:38.398,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So he became like a renaissance man,

96
0:04:40.406,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and here's what it looks like in the movie.

97
0:04:42.456,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Music)

98
0:04:54.776,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Video) Robert Lepage: [As usual, Arthur's drawing

99
0:04:56.944,000 --> 0:04:58,000
didn't account for the technical challenges.

100
0:04:59.138,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I welded the breech, but the valve is still gaping.

101
0:05:03.081,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I tried to lift the pallets to lower the pressure in the sound box,

102
0:05:07.364,000 --> 0:05:1,000
but I might have hit a heartstring.

103
0:05:11.296,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It still sounds too low.]

104
0:05:13.678,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Jacques Languirand: [That's normal.

105
0:05:14.609,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The instrument always ends up resembling its model.]

106
0:05:17.771,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Music)

107
0:05:38.266,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Martin Villeneuve: Now these musical instruments

108
0:05:41.684,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that you see in this excerpt,

109
0:05:43.828,000 --> 0:05:45,000
they're my second example of how

110
0:05:46.335,000 --> 0:05:48,000
constraints can boost creativity,

111
0:05:48.727,000 --> 0:05:51,000
because I desperately needed these objects in my movie.

112
0:05:51.947,000 --> 0:05:52,000
They are objects of desire.

113
0:05:53.648,000 --> 0:05:55,000
They are imaginary musical instruments.

114
0:05:56.043,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And they carry a nice story with them.

115
0:05:58.123,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Actually, I knew what these things would look like

116
0:06:02.777,000 --> 0:06:03,000
in my mind for many, many years.

117
0:06:04.607,000 --> 0:06:08,000
But my problem was, I didn't have the money

118
0:06:08.82,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to pay for them. I couldn't afford them.

119
0:06:11.601,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So that's kind of a big problem too.

120
0:06:14.032,000 --> 0:06:17,000
How do you get something that you can't afford?

121
0:06:17.633,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And, you know, I woke up one morning with a pretty good idea.

122
0:06:21.593,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I said, "What if I have somebody else pay for them?"

123
0:06:25.756,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Laughter)

124
0:06:28.617,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But who on Earth would be interested

125
0:06:32.345,000 --> 0:06:35,000
by seven not-yet-built musical instruments

126
0:06:35.561,000 --> 0:06:36,000
inspired by women's bodies?

127
0:06:37.261,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And I thought of Cirque du Soleil in Montreal,

128
0:06:40.175,000 --> 0:06:43,000
because who better to understand the kind of

129
0:06:43.533,000 --> 0:06:45,000
crazy poetry that I wanted to put on screen?

130
0:06:46.212,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So I found my way to Guy Laliberté, Cirque du Soleil's CEO,

131
0:06:49.386,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and I presented my crazy idea to him

132
0:06:52.154,000 --> 0:06:55,000
with sketches like this and visual references,

133
0:06:55.388,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and something pretty amazing happened.

134
0:06:58.115,000 --> 0:07:,000
Guy was interested by this idea

135
0:07:00.466,000 --> 0:07:03,000
not because I was asking for his money,

136
0:07:03.771,000 --> 0:07:06,000
but because I came to him with a good idea

137
0:07:07.197,000 --> 0:07:08,000
in which everybody was happy.

138
0:07:08.919,000 --> 0:07:1,000
It was kind of a perfect triangle

139
0:07:11.028,000 --> 0:07:14,000
in which the art buyer was happy

140
0:07:14.515,000 --> 0:07:16,000
because he got the instruments at a cheaper price,

141
0:07:17.455,000 --> 0:07:18,000
because they weren't even made.

142
0:07:19.328,000 --> 0:07:2,000
He took a leap of faith.

143
0:07:20.937,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And the artist, Dominique Engel, brilliant guy,

144
0:07:24.794,000 --> 0:07:26,000
he was happy too because he had a dream project

145
0:07:27.623,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to work on for a year.

146
0:07:29.104,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And obviously I was happy because I got the instruments

147
0:07:32.918,000 --> 0:07:36,000
in my film for free, which was kind of what I tried to do.

148
0:07:37.726,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So here they are.

149
0:07:39.444,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And my last example of how constraints

150
0:07:42.918,000 --> 0:07:43,000
can boost creativity

151
0:07:44.427,000 --> 0:07:47,000
comes from the green,

152
0:07:48.037,000 --> 0:07:51,000
because this is a weird color, a crazy color,

153
0:07:51.88,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and you need to replace the green screens eventually

154
0:07:54.942,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and you must figure that out sooner rather than later.

155
0:07:57.763,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And I had, again, pretty much, ideas in my mind

156
0:08:01.936,000 --> 0:08:03,000
as to what the world would be,

157
0:08:03.952,000 --> 0:08:08,000
but then again I turned to my childhood imagination

158
0:08:09.03,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and went to the work of Belgian comic book master

159
0:08:12.593,000 --> 0:08:14,000
François Schuiten in Belgium.

160
0:08:15.241,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And this guy is another guy I admire a lot,

161
0:08:18.561,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and I wanted him to be involved in the movie

162
0:08:21.033,000 --> 0:08:23,000
as a production designer.

163
0:08:23.281,000 --> 0:08:25,000
But people told me, you know, Martin, it's impossible,

164
0:08:25.618,000 --> 0:08:27,000
the guy is too busy and he will say no.

165
0:08:28.305,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Well, I said, you know what, instead of mimicking his style,

166
0:08:32.159,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I might as well call the real guy and ask him,

167
0:08:34.158,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and I sent him my books,

168
0:08:36.834,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and he answered that he was interested

169
0:08:38.857,000 --> 0:08:39,000
in working on the film with me

170
0:08:40.678,000 --> 0:08:44,000
because he could be a big fish in a small aquarium.

171
0:08:44.862,000 --> 0:08:47,000
In other words, there was space for him to dream with me.

172
0:08:48.756,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So here I was with one of my childhood heroes,

173
0:08:51.59,000 --> 0:08:53,000
drawing every single frame that's in the film

174
0:08:54.535,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to turn that into Montreal in the future.

175
0:08:57.749,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And it was an amazing collaboration

176
0:08:59.873,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to work with this great artist whom I admire.

177
0:09:02.526,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But then, you know, eventually you have to turn

178
0:09:06.214,000 --> 0:09:08,000
all these drawings into reality.

179
0:09:08.238,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So, again, my solution was to aim

180
0:09:11.367,000 --> 0:09:14,000
for the best possible artist that I could think of.

181
0:09:14.474,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And there's this guy in Montreal, another Quebecois

182
0:09:17.875,000 --> 0:09:2,000
called Carlos Monzon, and he's a very good VFX artist.

183
0:09:21.857,000 --> 0:09:24,000
This guy had been lead compositor on such films

184
0:09:25.339,000 --> 0:09:27,000
as "Avatar" and "Star Trek" and "Transformers,"

185
0:09:28.286,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and other unknown projects like this,

186
0:09:30.519,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and I knew he was the perfect fit for the job,

187
0:09:33.433,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and I had to convince him,

188
0:09:34.976,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and, instead of working on the next Spielberg movie,

189
0:09:38.407,000 --> 0:09:4,000
he accepted to work on mine.

190
0:09:40.463,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Why? Because I offered him a space to dream.

191
0:09:44.25,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So if you don't have money to offer to people,

192
0:09:47.664,000 --> 0:09:5,000
you must strike their imagination with something

193
0:09:50.879,000 --> 0:09:52,000
as nice as you can think of.

194
0:09:53.391,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So this is what happened on this movie,

195
0:09:55.767,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and that's how it got made,

196
0:09:57.108,000 --> 0:10:,000
and we went to this very nice postproduction company

197
0:10:00.239,000 --> 0:10:02,000
in Montreal called Vision Globale,

198
0:10:02.311,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and they lent their 60 artists to work full time

199
0:10:06.948,000 --> 0:10:08,000
for six months to do this crazy film.

200
0:10:09.894,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So I want to tell you that, if you have some crazy ideas

201
0:10:14.683,000 --> 0:10:15,000
in your mind, and that people tell you

202
0:10:16.356,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that it's impossible to make,

203
0:10:17.843,000 --> 0:10:19,000
well, that's an even better reason to want to do it,

204
0:10:20.438,000 --> 0:10:22,000
because people have a tendency

205
0:10:22.538,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to see the problems rather than the final result,

206
0:10:25.869,000 --> 0:10:27,000
whereas if you start to deal with problems

207
0:10:28.651,000 --> 0:10:3,000
as being your allies rather than your opponents,

208
0:10:31.453,000 --> 0:10:33,000
life will start to dance with you

209
0:10:33.964,000 --> 0:10:34,000
in the most amazing way.

210
0:10:35.52,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I have experienced it.

211
0:10:37.208,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And you might end up doing some crazy projects,

212
0:10:40.267,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and who knows, you might even end up

213
0:10:43.206,000 --> 0:10:45,000
going to Mars.

214
0:10:45.47,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Thank you.

215
0:10:47.171,000 --> 0:10:5,000
(Applause)

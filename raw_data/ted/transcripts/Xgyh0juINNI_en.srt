1
0:00:11.99,000 --> 0:00:15,000
my name's Chris Anderson I'm the guy

2
0:00:14.04,000 --> 0:00:19,000
lucky enough to run the head

3
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
organization it's a treat to be here

4
0:00:19.59,000 --> 0:00:22,000
with you thank you so much for taking

5
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
time to come and be part of this this is

6
0:00:22.98,000 --> 0:00:26,000
new for Ted this is you know we're known

7
0:00:25.35,000 --> 0:00:29,000
for TED Talks

8
0:00:27.119,000 --> 0:00:32,000
here we're going to spend an hour in

9
0:00:29.539,000 --> 0:00:35,000
conversation with some of the world's

10
0:00:32.39,000 --> 0:00:4,000
wisest people because this is a moment

11
0:00:35.879,000 --> 0:00:43,000
when we need that wisdom more than ever

12
0:00:40.46,000 --> 0:00:46,000
though we're facing the pandemic that

13
0:00:44.04,000 --> 0:00:48,000
we've warned about you know these are

14
0:00:46.86,000 --> 0:00:51,000
extraordinary times times we'll remember

15
0:00:48.449,000 --> 0:00:54,000
for the rest of our lives I suspect and

16
0:00:51.979,000 --> 0:00:56,000
it's not like you know the battle is

17
0:00:55.44,000 --> 0:01:,000
just the external battle the battle

18
0:00:57.839,000 --> 0:01:02,000
against the virus the decisions that our

19
0:01:00.51,000 --> 0:01:05,000
leaders make there's this other battle

20
0:01:03.42,000 --> 0:01:08,000
as well that is probably equally as

21
0:01:05.7,000 --> 0:01:12,000
consequential the battle that's going on

22
0:01:09.09,000 --> 0:01:15,000
right inside our minds I mean if you're

23
0:01:12.96,000 --> 0:01:16,000
anything like me you've had heard this

24
0:01:15.3,000 --> 0:01:21,000
real rollercoaster of emotions the last

25
0:01:17.73,000 --> 0:01:24,000
few days weeks this is scary this is

26
0:01:22.23,000 --> 0:01:26,000
different this is alarming you know we

27
0:01:25.2,000 --> 0:01:3,000
don't know what to what to make of it a

28
0:01:26.82,000 --> 0:01:32,000
lot of us and the decisions we make

29
0:01:31.08,000 --> 0:01:36,000
collectively I think is going to be

30
0:01:33.15,000 --> 0:01:38,000
hugely consequential on one scenario

31
0:01:36.57,000 --> 0:01:41,000
there's a chance that we can use this

32
0:01:38.67,000 --> 0:01:43,000
moment to build community to build bonds

33
0:01:42.18,000 --> 0:01:46,000
with each other to get to know each

34
0:01:44.55,000 --> 0:01:47,000
other in different ways to spend time

35
0:01:46.56,000 --> 0:01:5,000
with people we haven't spent time with

36
0:01:47.85,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to look for the best in each other and

37
0:01:50.63,000 --> 0:01:56,000
on another scenario our fear and anger

38
0:01:54.63,000 --> 0:01:59,000
will drive us apart I'd like to

39
0:01:57.54,000 --> 0:02:03,000
introduce the questioner in chief my

40
0:02:00.38,000 --> 0:02:05,000

our guests you know as Chris mentioned

48
0:02:18.36,000 --> 0:02:2,000
there's so

49
0:02:19.819,000 --> 0:02:22,000
happening in the media so much

50
0:02:20.9,000 --> 0:02:25,000
conversation around the coronavirus and

51
0:02:23.569,000 --> 0:02:27,000
oftentimes it's focused on the things

52
0:02:26.12,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that our government officials are doing

53
0:02:28.069,000 --> 0:02:32,000
the decisions that they're making so

54
0:02:30.29,000 --> 0:02:33,000
what's happening to our lives physically

55
0:02:32.15,000 --> 0:02:37,000
what are some of the changes that we're

56
0:02:33.95,000 --> 0:02:4,000
experiencing as far as working remotely

57
0:02:37.93,000 --> 0:02:43,000
social distancing but what often is

58
0:02:41.03,000 --> 0:02:46,000
overlooked is the social and the

59
0:02:44.06,000 --> 0:02:49,000
emotional toll that this is all taking

60
0:02:46.7,000 --> 0:02:5,000
on of all of us which is a really

61
0:02:49.4,000 --> 0:02:53,000
critically important and a very real

62
0:02:51.109,000 --> 0:02:56,000
part of how we're all experiencing this

63
0:02:53.75,000 --> 0:02:58,000
pandemic and so we're we're really

64
0:02:56.48,000 --> 0:03:,000
thrilled to be joined today by renowned

65
0:02:59.15,000 --> 0:03:03,000
author and harvard medical school

66
0:03:01.37,000 --> 0:03:06,000
psychologist susan david she gave a

67
0:03:04.099,000 --> 0:03:08,000
hugely popular TED talk about emotional

68
0:03:07.01,000 --> 0:03:11,000
courage and the impact that

69
0:03:08.959,000 --> 0:03:13,000
understanding your emotions can have on

70
0:03:11.18,000 --> 0:03:15,000
your lives on our lives and so we're

71
0:03:14.06,000 --> 0:03:19,000
excited to chat with her about how we

72
0:03:16.159,000 --> 0:03:21,000
can approach this as we're experiencing

73
0:03:19.189,000 --> 0:03:23,000
this pandemic in this moment thank you

74
0:03:21.919,000 --> 0:03:24,000
for inviting me to the conversation I'm

75
0:03:23.78,000 --> 0:03:26,000
delighted to be part of it I really

76
0:03:25.31,000 --> 0:03:29,000
appreciate it thank you so much for

77
0:03:27.739,000 --> 0:03:32,000
being here with us today so we're we're

78
0:03:29.629,000 --> 0:03:33,000
again excited to have you and I I guess

79
0:03:32.84,000 --> 0:03:36,000
first and foremost how are you doing how

80
0:03:34.25,000 --> 0:03:39,000
are you holding up well I think like

81
0:03:37.28,000 --> 0:03:41,000
everyone we're doing the best we can

82
0:03:39.62,000 --> 0:03:45,000
given the circumstances my husband is a

83
0:03:42.139,000 --> 0:03:48,000
physician at MGH and it's really a stark

84
0:03:46.459,000 --> 0:03:49,000
reality when one week you saying you

85
0:03:48.799,000 --> 0:03:51,000
know can you pick up groceries in the

86
0:03:50.299,000 --> 0:03:53,000
next week you exchanging emergency

87
0:03:52.31,000 --> 0:03:55,000
contact information if something were to

88
0:03:53.9,000 --> 0:03:57,000
go wrong so you know we're all living

89
0:03:56.239,000 --> 0:04:01,000
this reality and I think trying to find

90
0:03:58.609,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the inner resources to do that in the

91
0:04:01.25,000 --> 0:04:07,000
best way we can is just a profound

92
0:04:04.159,000 --> 0:04:1,000
importance right now but thank you yeah

93
0:04:07.609,000 --> 0:04:11,000
no definitely I'm glad to hear that

94
0:04:10.43,000 --> 0:04:14,000
you're you're managing and hanging in

95
0:04:12.229,000 --> 0:04:16,000
there your work is is so focused around

96
0:04:14.75,000 --> 0:04:18,000
how we can best prepare ourselves

97
0:04:16.4,000 --> 0:04:21,000
emotionally and psychologically for

98
0:04:19.609,000 --> 0:04:23,000
these moments of change and complexity

99
0:04:21.56,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and you have this really beautiful

100
0:04:24.08,000 --> 0:04:28,000
saying about life's beauty is

101
0:04:26.02,000 --> 0:04:3,000
inseparable from its fragility what does

102
0:04:28.58,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that mean and how does that apply to the

103
0:04:30.409,000 --> 0:04:35,000
the current moment we're all experienced

104
0:04:33.24,000 --> 0:04:38,000
well I think we all know this internally

105
0:04:36.03,000 --> 0:04:41,000
at some level that there is this complex

106
0:04:38.52,000 --> 0:04:42,000
an intimate beautiful relationship

107
0:04:41.52,000 --> 0:04:45,000
between the beauty of life and the

108
0:04:42.9,000 --> 0:04:48,000
fragility of life we love and then we

109
0:04:45.72,000 --> 0:04:51,000
lose we are healthy until we are ill we

110
0:04:49.41,000 --> 0:04:54,000
enjoy in which we need it until those

111
0:04:51.84,000 --> 0:04:56,000
jobs are no longer we might you know

112
0:04:54.479,000 --> 0:04:59,000
roll our eyes and yell at our kids and

113
0:04:57.479,000 --> 0:05:,000
ask them to tidy their rooms and then

114
0:04:59.58,000 --> 0:05:02,000
one day there's silence where their

115
0:05:01.11,000 --> 0:05:04,000
child once was they're now making their

116
0:05:03.15,000 --> 0:05:08,000
way in the world and so there's this

117
0:05:05.039,000 --> 0:05:11,000
complex interplay between the beauty and

118
0:05:08.759,000 --> 0:05:13,000
the fragility of life that just is what

119
0:05:11.22,000 --> 0:05:16,000
makes the wholeness of life and it's so

120
0:05:14.4,000 --> 0:05:18,000
often in our narratives in society we

121
0:05:16.68,000 --> 0:05:2,000
talk about you know focusing on success

122
0:05:19.02,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and being positive all the time and

123
0:05:20.849,000 --> 0:05:24,000
goal-setting and you know there's this

124
0:05:23.34,000 --> 0:05:27,000
whole even even our avoidance that we

125
0:05:25.77,000 --> 0:05:29,000
have really I think at a very broad

126
0:05:28.139,000 --> 0:05:32,000
level in society our voidance of talking

127
0:05:30.12,000 --> 0:05:34,000
about what is the most common feature

128
0:05:32.46,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that all of us or common experience that

129
0:05:34.889,000 --> 0:05:38,000
all of us will go through which is to

130
0:05:37.02,000 --> 0:05:43,000
die and yet so much of our society is

131
0:05:39.72,000 --> 0:05:47,000
constructed around preventing avoidance

132
0:05:43.139,000 --> 0:05:49,000
denial of this reality and you know the

133
0:05:47.94,000 --> 0:05:5,000
circumstance that we in now is not

134
0:05:49.74,000 --> 0:05:54,000
something that we asked for

135
0:05:51.53,000 --> 0:05:58,000
but life is calling on every single one

136
0:05:55.139,000 --> 0:06:02,000
of us to move into the place of wisdom

137
0:05:59.07,000 --> 0:06:06,000
in ourselves beyond the thinking judgey

138
0:06:02.37,000 --> 0:06:1,000
county mind into the space of wisdom and

139
0:06:06.69,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and fortitude and solidarity community

140
0:06:10.62,000 --> 0:06:16,000
courage and it's a calling for all of us

141
0:06:13.409,000 --> 0:06:2,000
right now that I think is just so imaged

142
0:06:16.919,000 --> 0:06:22,000
in what is in our absolute and our

143
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
reality the fragility of life right now

144
0:06:23.219,000 --> 0:06:26,000
thank you for that and I mean and I

145
0:06:25.169,000 --> 0:06:28,000
think that for a lot of us when we're

146
0:06:26.94,000 --> 0:06:3,000
thinking about how our lives have

147
0:06:28.56,000 --> 0:06:33,000
changed you know and we are approaching

148
0:06:31.199,000 --> 0:06:35,000
this idea of happiness so many of the

149
0:06:33.78,000 --> 0:06:37,000
things that at one point really did

150
0:06:36.15,000 --> 0:06:4,000
bring us a lot of joy being able to go

151
0:06:37.949,000 --> 0:06:42,000
out with friends and socialize and spend

152
0:06:40.68,000 --> 0:06:43,000
physical time with loved ones so many of

153
0:06:43.02,000 --> 0:06:45,000
those things have changed

154
0:06:43.979,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but you know I guess in

155
0:06:45.84,000 --> 0:06:49,000
moment how do you advise that we

156
0:06:48.15,000 --> 0:06:52,000
cultivate happiness and enjoy with all

157
0:06:50.52,000 --> 0:06:53,000
everything that's going on well so just

158
0:06:52.83,000 --> 0:06:56,000
to be clear firstly I'm not anti

159
0:06:54.449,000 --> 0:07:,000
happiness which you'll understand why

160
0:06:57.15,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I'm saying this as I progressed I think

161
0:07:01.05,000 --> 0:07:06,000
though that often again we have this

162
0:07:03.9,000 --> 0:07:09,000
narrative in society that is about be

163
0:07:06.449,000 --> 0:07:12,000
happy and be positive and whilst that

164
0:07:10.71,000 --> 0:07:13,000
may sound like it's the right thing and

165
0:07:12.66,000 --> 0:07:15,000
it sounds like that is the thing that we

166
0:07:14.669,000 --> 0:07:17,000
should all be saying you know just keep

167
0:07:16.02,000 --> 0:07:19,000
positive or you know when people are

168
0:07:18.12,000 --> 0:07:21,000
experiencing cancer they're told to just

169
0:07:19.919,000 --> 0:07:22,000
be positive or when people are being

170
0:07:21.479,000 --> 0:07:25,000
marginalized or discriminated against

171
0:07:23.4,000 --> 0:07:28,000
just stop being so angry you know we

172
0:07:25.5,000 --> 0:07:32,000
have in our society this um almost

173
0:07:28.61,000 --> 0:07:34,000
judgment that happiness and joy are the

174
0:07:32.88,000 --> 0:07:37,000
most important emotional experiences

175
0:07:35.31,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that we can have and on the other hands

176
0:07:38.19,000 --> 0:07:45,000
are so called bad or negative emotions

177
0:07:40.919,000 --> 0:07:48,000
are frustration anxiety grief loss fear

178
0:07:46.02,000 --> 0:07:5,000
sadness and so what we do is we often

179
0:07:49.44,000 --> 0:07:52,000
become very comfortable with happiness

180
0:07:50.88,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and we become uncomfortable with those

181
0:07:52.83,000 --> 0:07:55,000
difficult emotions and we push them

182
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
aside but I think what store often

183
0:07:56.55,000 --> 0:08:01,000
happens when we try to pursue some idea

184
0:07:59.669,000 --> 0:08:04,000
of well going out was what made me happy

185
0:08:02.01,000 --> 0:08:07,000
or I can't go clubbing this weekend and

186
0:08:05.19,000 --> 0:08:09,000
now I can't be happy is what we're doing

187
0:08:07.5,000 --> 0:08:11,000
is we're basically establishing the

188
0:08:09.419,000 --> 0:08:16,000
anchor point of happiness around

189
0:08:12.38,000 --> 0:08:17,000
expectations or goals and what we know

190
0:08:16.83,000 --> 0:08:19,000
actually when we look at the scientific

191
0:08:18.21,000 --> 0:08:23,000
literature is that when we overly

192
0:08:20.31,000 --> 0:08:24,000
strongly focus on happiness as a goal we

193
0:08:23.31,000 --> 0:08:26,000
actually become less happier over time

194
0:08:25.08,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and it's this really interesting paradox

195
0:08:27.3,000 --> 0:08:32,000
because that's we almost seeking

196
0:08:29.49,000 --> 0:08:34,000
something as opposed to just living our

197
0:08:32.52,000 --> 0:08:37,000
lives in a way that is I'm passionate

198
0:08:35.07,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and accepting what I would say is that

199
0:08:38.089,000 --> 0:08:45,000
rather than trying to find happiness I

200
0:08:42.12,000 --> 0:08:49,000
think now for all of us is actually a

201
0:08:45.15,000 --> 0:08:53,000
space for us to come into ourselves to

202
0:08:49.35,000 --> 0:08:56,000
come into our emotions to not try to

203
0:08:53.49,000 --> 0:08:59,000
brush away the grief or the loneliness

204
0:08:57.3,000 --> 0:09:04,000
or the anxiety but to our

205
0:08:59.66,000 --> 0:09:06,000
face into that one of those stories that

206
0:09:04.68,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I spoke about in my TED talk which has

207
0:09:06.81,000 --> 0:09:11,000
really stuck with me my whole life was

208
0:09:09.329,000 --> 0:09:16,000
when I was about five years old I became

209
0:09:12.379,000 --> 0:09:18,000
absolutely aware of the fact that I was

210
0:09:16.589,000 --> 0:09:19,000
gonna die one day and this is very

211
0:09:18.48,000 --> 0:09:21,000
normal around the age of five or six

212
0:09:20.189,000 --> 0:09:24,000
years old children become aware of their

213
0:09:21.779,000 --> 0:09:26,000
own mortality and I became aware of the

214
0:09:24.779,000 --> 0:09:27,000
fact that I was going to die and if my

215
0:09:27.149,000 --> 0:09:33,000
parents weren't going to be around

216
0:09:28.47,000 --> 0:09:35,000
forever and I would find my way into my

217
0:09:33.3,000 --> 0:09:37,000
parents bed at night you know squeezing

218
0:09:35.519,000 --> 0:09:39,000
between the two of them and I would say

219
0:09:37.949,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to my father and my mother

220
0:09:39.629,000 --> 0:09:43,000
you know promise me that you won't die I

221
0:09:41.6,000 --> 0:09:48,000
must me you won't die and I was five and

222
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I was desperate and my father was so

223
0:09:49.519,000 --> 0:09:55,000
profoundly beautiful in the way he told

224
0:09:52.949,000 --> 0:09:57,000
me during those nights he didn't try to

225
0:09:56.069,000 --> 0:10:,000
build some false narrative oh just be

226
0:09:58.35,000 --> 0:10:01,000
positive I'm gonna be around don't worry

227
0:10:00.389,000 --> 0:10:03,000
about me everything's fine

228
0:10:01.86,000 --> 0:10:06,000
he didn't try to build some false

229
0:10:04.319,000 --> 0:10:11,000
narrative between me and reality what he

230
0:10:07.74,000 --> 0:10:14,000
said to me is dizzy it's normal to be

231
0:10:11.73,000 --> 0:10:18,000
scared we all die and it's normal to be

232
0:10:15.449,000 --> 0:10:21,000
scared and what we need to do is we need

233
0:10:19.439,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to not try to away with fear but rather

234
0:10:21.809,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to reach inside ourselves and to find

235
0:10:24.75,000 --> 0:10:28,000
the courage and I think there is a

236
0:10:26.73,000 --> 0:10:32,000
message for our times which is not to

237
0:10:29.55,000 --> 0:10:34,000
try rush aside or belittle or judge

238
0:10:33.629,000 --> 0:10:37,000
yourself if you experiencing difficult

239
0:10:35.37,000 --> 0:10:41,000
emotions this is a tough time but rather

240
0:10:38.579,000 --> 0:10:43,000
we can use strategies to enable us to be

241
0:10:42.089,000 --> 0:10:46,000
with those emotions in healthy ways

242
0:10:43.709,000 --> 0:10:47,000
which is the whole foundational

243
0:10:46.819,000 --> 0:10:51,000
experience of what I call emotional

244
0:10:48.6,000 --> 0:10:54,000
agility this is ultimately what will

245
0:10:52.009,000 --> 0:10:58,000
enable us to bring the best of ourselves

246
0:10:55.079,000 --> 0:11:02,000
forward in every aspect of how we love

247
0:10:58.41,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and how we lead in these times we parent

248
0:11:02.25,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and how we come to ourselves and I think

249
0:11:05.129,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that that's exactly what we'd love to

250
0:11:06.959,000 --> 0:11:09,000
hear more about is this emotional

251
0:11:08.55,000 --> 0:11:11,000
agility that you just referenced maybe

252
0:11:10.23,000 --> 0:11:13,000
just first start there what is the most

253
0:11:12.01,000 --> 0:11:16,000
agility what are the the main tenets of

254
0:11:13.99,000 --> 0:11:17,000
this philosophy well the first part of

255
0:11:16.96,000 --> 0:11:2,000
emotional agility which is really

256
0:11:18.61,000 --> 0:11:22,000
critical is moving away from I think

257
0:11:21.52,000 --> 0:11:25,000
what so many of us have I did some

258
0:11:23.56,000 --> 0:11:26,000
research where I was asking people you

259
0:11:25.6,000 --> 0:11:28,000
know when you have difficulty emotional

260
0:11:27.01,000 --> 0:11:31,000
experiences what do you tend to do with

261
0:11:29.23,000 --> 0:11:34,000
them and I did surveys of around 70,000

262
0:11:31.9,000 --> 0:11:38,000
people and what I found is that a large

263
0:11:34.66,000 --> 0:11:4,000
majority of us maybe you know driven by

264
0:11:38.98,000 --> 0:11:4,000
this narrative of I've got to be happy

265
0:11:40.78,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and positive all the time

266
0:11:41.86,000 --> 0:11:45,000
what we tend to do when we have these

267
0:11:43.78,000 --> 0:11:47,000
difficult emotional experiences is we do

268
0:11:45.94,000 --> 0:11:5,000
we judge them we've been little then we

269
0:11:48.25,000 --> 0:11:53,000
push them aside or we get stuck in them

270
0:11:50.98,000 --> 0:11:54,000
so the language that I use is we often

271
0:11:53.29,000 --> 0:11:57,000
bottle our emotions we rationalize them

272
0:11:55.51,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and we push them aside or we brood on

273
0:11:57.97,000 --> 0:12:,000
them and we get stuck in them and what

274
0:11:59.77,000 --> 0:12:02,000
emotional agility is and I can talk

275
0:12:01.51,000 --> 0:12:04,000
about this you know in terms of its

276
0:12:02.92,000 --> 0:12:05,000
principles but also its strategies in

277
0:12:04.72,000 --> 0:12:09,000
more detail but really what emotional

278
0:12:06.64,000 --> 0:12:13,000
agility is it's the ability to be with

279
0:12:10.09,000 --> 0:12:16,000
ourselves our full selves our full

280
0:12:13.96,000 --> 0:12:19,000
emotional experience in ways that are

281
0:12:16.72,000 --> 0:12:23,000
compassionate because the Syst of and

282
0:12:20.71,000 --> 0:12:25,000
these emotions are real so we need to be

283
0:12:24.49,000 --> 0:12:29,000
compassionate with ourselves and others

284
0:12:25.92,000 --> 0:12:3,000
we need to be curious you know what is

285
0:12:29.53,000 --> 0:12:34,000
my frustration telling me about what's

286
0:12:31.48,000 --> 0:12:36,000
important to me what is my guilt telling

287
0:12:35.05,000 --> 0:12:38,000
me when I'm interacting with my children

288
0:12:36.94,000 --> 0:12:4,000
right now what is they telling me about

289
0:12:39.04,000 --> 0:12:44,000
what's important there are so many

290
0:12:41.53,000 --> 0:12:46,000
millions of people who are jobless or

291
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
disenfranchised or in situations of

292
0:12:47.49,000 --> 0:12:52,000
profound difficulty right now and I've

293
0:12:50.38,000 --> 0:12:56,000
got anger towards that what is my anger

294
0:12:52.51,000 --> 0:12:57,000
tell me about what I value so if we can

295
0:12:56.56,000 --> 0:13:,000
move into a space where instead of

296
0:12:58.03,000 --> 0:13:03,000
pushing aside these signposts that our

297
0:13:00.85,000 --> 0:13:04,000
emotions give us and instead move into a

298
0:13:03.07,000 --> 0:13:08,000
space where we are passionate with them

299
0:13:05.43,000 --> 0:13:11,000
where we curious with them and where we

300
0:13:08.77,000 --> 0:13:13,000
start saying how can I even in the midst

301
0:13:12.22,000 --> 0:13:16,000
of fear I don't need to do away with my

302
0:13:14.11,000 --> 0:13:2,000
fear the fear just is it's my body it's

303
0:13:17.2,000 --> 0:13:24,000
my mind it's my emotions doing their job

304
0:13:20.35,000 --> 0:13:25,000
our emotions have evolved to help us

305
0:13:24.52,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and so when we feel fear that's our

306
0:13:26.29,000 --> 0:13:31,000
emotion trying to help us so the

307
0:13:28.69,000 --> 0:13:32,000
important thing here is not to do away

308
0:13:31.3,000 --> 0:13:35,000
with it but also not to get stuck in it

309
0:13:33.49,000 --> 0:13:38,000
so to develop a sense of what our

310
0:13:36.28,000 --> 0:13:41,000
courageous steps that I can take even in

311
0:13:39.04,000 --> 0:13:44,000
the midst of a reality that I didn't

312
0:13:41.38,000 --> 0:13:46,000
choose and that isn't of my asking how

313
0:13:44.68,000 --> 0:13:48,000
can I bring myself forward in a way

314
0:13:46.6,000 --> 0:13:52,000
that's courageous and connected so in

315
0:13:49.66,000 --> 0:13:55,000
brief emotionally is the ability to be

316
0:13:52.78,000 --> 0:13:57,000
with ourselves in our fullness with

317
0:13:56.08,000 --> 0:14:,000
compassion curiosity so that we can live

318
0:13:58.75,000 --> 0:14:01,000
in ways that our valley is connected

319
0:14:00.58,000 --> 0:14:02,000
that's beautiful

320
0:14:01.9,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and I think that that for me that's

321
0:14:03.31,000 --> 0:14:06,000
definitely really meaningful in thinking

322
0:14:04.72,000 --> 0:14:07,000
about how I'm personally experiencing a

323
0:14:07.03,000 --> 0:14:11,000
lot of this and I imagine for a lot of

324
0:14:08.41,000 --> 0:14:12,000
folks and and so I'm curious then in

325
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
thinking about emotional agility free

326
0:14:13.18,000 --> 0:14:18,000
you know pandemic and today what are

327
0:14:16.81,000 --> 0:14:19,000
some of the differences between how you

328
0:14:18.7,000 --> 0:14:21,000
might practice that before and how are

329
0:14:20.62,000 --> 0:14:23,000
you practicing that now what are some of

330
0:14:22.09,000 --> 0:14:26,000
the the ways practicing emotional

331
0:14:24.13,000 --> 0:14:28,000
agility has changed well I think the

332
0:14:26.8,000 --> 0:14:29,000
principles of emotional agility are

333
0:14:28.45,000 --> 0:14:32,000
actually fundamental principles of

334
0:14:30.67,000 --> 0:14:34,000
psychological health and wellness

335
0:14:32.67,000 --> 0:14:37,000
regardless of the context that we end

336
0:14:35.11,000 --> 0:14:42,000
regardless of whether we stressed in our

337
0:14:37.81,000 --> 0:14:42,000
job or you know struggling to be with

338
0:14:42.4,000 --> 0:14:44,000
our children in a way that's effective

339
0:14:43.57,000 --> 0:14:46,000
over dinnertime

340
0:14:45.07,000 --> 0:14:48,000
you know those must have been the

341
0:14:46.84,000 --> 0:14:5,000
day-to-day realities that we

342
0:14:48.76,000 --> 0:14:52,000
experiencing and I think that all that's

343
0:14:51.1,000 --> 0:14:55,000
really happened is the need for

344
0:14:53.14,000 --> 0:14:57,000
emotional agility becomes so much more

345
0:14:55.9,000 --> 0:15:01,000
profound and so much clearer

346
0:14:57.85,000 --> 0:15:03,000
we also are deciding whether we let that

347
0:15:02.23,000 --> 0:15:07,000
narrative that is coming through the

348
0:15:04.54,000 --> 0:15:1,000
media own us whether we're going to let

349
0:15:07.87,000 --> 0:15:12,000
our emotions earn us or whether we are

350
0:15:10.63,000 --> 0:15:16,000
going to exert some kind of empowerment

351
0:15:13.57,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and connection over these experiences

352
0:15:17.5,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and whether we going to earn it and you

353
0:15:20.29,000 --> 0:15:24,000
know what always just comes to mind and

354
0:15:22.06,000 --> 0:15:28,000
it's it's probably you know very oft

355
0:15:25.12,000 --> 0:15:3,000
used phrase but it really I think is so

356
0:15:28.83,000 --> 0:15:33,000
profoundly important right now I think

357
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:37,000
as I'm speaking of that beautiful Viktor

358
0:15:34.42,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Frankl idea Viktor Frankl who

359
0:15:37.8,000 --> 0:15:43,000
survived the Nazi death camps who

360
0:15:41.059,000 --> 0:15:46,000
describes what I think is the most

361
0:15:43.8,000 --> 0:15:47,000
profoundly powerful human sentiment and

362
0:15:46.079,000 --> 0:15:52,000
it's this that between stimulus and

363
0:15:48.72,000 --> 0:15:54,000
response there is a space and in that

364
0:15:52.23,000 --> 0:15:57,000
space is our power to choose and it's in

365
0:15:55.47,000 --> 0:15:59,000
that choice that lies our growth and

366
0:15:57.449,000 --> 0:16:02,000
freedom we didn't choose these

367
0:15:59.639,000 --> 0:16:05,000
circumstances often what happens is we

368
0:16:02.519,000 --> 0:16:07,000
get hooked we get into an experience

369
0:16:05.879,000 --> 0:16:07,000
where there's no space between stimulus

370
0:16:07.709,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and response

371
0:16:08.519,000 --> 0:16:12,000
we either mindlessly you know go ant our

372
0:16:10.949,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Twitter feeds and we engage with the

373
0:16:13.47,000 --> 0:16:17,000
news and we catastrophize or we feelin

374
0:16:15.689,000 --> 0:16:2,000
so stressed out or we avoiding or and so

375
0:16:18.239,000 --> 0:16:23,000
I think this is really a time of peering

376
0:16:21.209,000 --> 0:16:25,000
space between stimulus and response we

377
0:16:23.879,000 --> 0:16:27,000
do that by being open to what we

378
0:16:25.92,000 --> 0:16:29,000
experiencing by saying what do I need to

379
0:16:28.139,000 --> 0:16:32,000
do here but being intentional and the

380
0:16:30.509,000 --> 0:16:32,000
particular strategies are thinking short

381
0:16:32.429,000 --> 0:16:35,000
answer to your question you know

382
0:16:33.42,000 --> 0:16:38,000
emotional agility are basically the

383
0:16:35.999,000 --> 0:16:4,000
skills that are foundational to wellness

384
0:16:39.079,000 --> 0:16:44,000
within ourselves to being healthy within

385
0:16:41.61,000 --> 0:16:47,000
ourselves every day what's happening in

386
0:16:44.61,000 --> 0:16:5,000
this context is we are needing to bring

387
0:16:47.819,000 --> 0:16:51,000
those skills with greater courage and

388
0:16:50.79,000 --> 0:16:54,000
strength to the situation that we face

389
0:16:52.589,000 --> 0:16:56,000
I'm curious to I guess and if we can

390
0:16:55.199,000 --> 0:16:59,000
look at some specific issues that people

391
0:16:56.759,000 --> 0:17:,000
might be experiencing I think one of the

392
0:16:59.249,000 --> 0:17:03,000
big ones with social distancing is that

393
0:17:01.439,000 --> 0:17:05,000
a lot of folks who at one point you know

394
0:17:04.079,000 --> 0:17:07,000
went to an office are now working at

395
0:17:06.24,000 --> 0:17:1,000
home they're working at home get

396
0:17:07.559,000 --> 0:17:12,000
sleeping at home relaxing at home and so

397
0:17:10.289,000 --> 0:17:13,000
maybe in talking about that specifically

398
0:17:12.63,000 --> 0:17:15,000
for some of the ways this might impact

399
0:17:14.189,000 --> 0:17:18,000
us and then what are some areas that you

400
0:17:15.929,000 --> 0:17:2,000
think you can apply from emotional

401
0:17:18.419,000 --> 0:17:24,000
agility to young to this new this new

402
0:17:21.419,000 --> 0:17:26,000
normal yeah so and very important point

403
0:17:24.75,000 --> 0:17:27,000
is I think you know when I talk about

404
0:17:26.459,000 --> 0:17:29,000
having more space to have these

405
0:17:28.11,000 --> 0:17:32,000
experiences of course that doesn't mean

406
0:17:29.97,000 --> 0:17:34,000
we are always alone we might be as I am

407
0:17:32.73,000 --> 0:17:37,000
I've got two young children who are now

408
0:17:35.07,000 --> 0:17:39,000
home from school and I'm trying to do my

409
0:17:38.49,000 --> 0:17:42,000
work and I'm trying to look after them

410
0:17:39.899,000 --> 0:17:45,000
and there's a lot that's going on but we

411
0:17:43.35,000 --> 0:17:52,000
on spending hours commuting you know

412
0:17:46.77,000 --> 0:17:53,000
most most of us we on spending hour

413
0:17:52.37,000 --> 0:17:55,000
distracting or avoiding outside of the

414
0:17:54.66,000 --> 0:17:58,000
house so we're really starting to think

415
0:17:55.98,000 --> 0:17:59,000
about how they're using what I've got in

416
0:17:58.83,000 --> 0:18:02,000
the space in this context right now

417
0:18:00.84,000 --> 0:18:04,000
don't you know one of the things that I

418
0:18:03,000 --> 0:18:08,000
think is really profoundly important is

419
0:18:05.81,000 --> 0:18:1,000
when we think about social distancing I

420
0:18:08.85,000 --> 0:18:12,000
think a better way for us to all be

421
0:18:11.37,000 --> 0:18:14,000
thinking about this originally the media

422
0:18:13.8,000 --> 0:18:17,000
had used this language of social

423
0:18:15.15,000 --> 0:18:2,000
distancing but actually what we're

424
0:18:18.78,000 --> 0:18:22,000
thinking about here is physical

425
0:18:20.4,000 --> 0:18:26,000
distancing physical distancing we can

426
0:18:23.58,000 --> 0:18:29,000
still if we are social creatures which

427
0:18:26.55,000 --> 0:18:32,000
many of us are we still need to be able

428
0:18:29.88,000 --> 0:18:34,000
to look for meaningful quality

429
0:18:32.82,000 --> 0:18:36,000
interactions that are really critically

430
0:18:35.64,000 --> 0:18:39,000
important to us right now

431
0:18:36.9,000 --> 0:18:41,000
so we know that we can be lonely in a

432
0:18:39.99,000 --> 0:18:43,000
crowd you know we don't we don't we

433
0:18:42.57,000 --> 0:18:46,000
don't need when we think about

434
0:18:44.82,000 --> 0:18:48,000
loneliness loneliness is not just oh I'm

435
0:18:47.01,000 --> 0:18:51,000
by myself therefore I'm lonely you can

436
0:18:49.11,000 --> 0:18:53,000
be in a crowd of people and be lonely so

437
0:18:51.81,000 --> 0:18:54,000
what is it that we think about when we

438
0:18:53.55,000 --> 0:18:56,000
think about how do you mitigate against

439
0:18:55.71,000 --> 0:19:,000
or how do you ameliorate learning us

440
0:18:57.5,000 --> 0:19:03,000
learning this is actually a function of

441
0:19:00.84,000 --> 0:19:06,000
whether our our interactions are

442
0:19:03.84,000 --> 0:19:09,000
meaningful or not so again this idea

443
0:19:07.47,000 --> 0:19:12,000
that emotions tell us a story behind our

444
0:19:10.65,000 --> 0:19:14,000
most difficult emotions are signposts to

445
0:19:12.63,000 --> 0:19:16,000
the things that we care about if you

446
0:19:14.88,000 --> 0:19:19,000
find yourself feeling lonely as an

447
0:19:17.25,000 --> 0:19:22,000
example what is that loneliness the

448
0:19:20.37,000 --> 0:19:25,000
signpost of the loneliness is often the

449
0:19:23.1,000 --> 0:19:28,000
signpost that you value presence and

450
0:19:25.98,000 --> 0:19:3,000
connectedness and that you don't have

451
0:19:28.56,000 --> 0:19:31,000
enough of it now so that loneliness is

452
0:19:31.2,000 --> 0:19:35,000
telling you that there's something that

453
0:19:32.49,000 --> 0:19:38,000
you value that you need to be moving

454
0:19:35.22,000 --> 0:19:39,000
more in the direction of and so you can

455
0:19:38.85,000 --> 0:19:42,000
start asking yourself what are some

456
0:19:40.2,000 --> 0:19:45,000
small changes that I can make that are

457
0:19:43.11,000 --> 0:19:48,000
really important to me right now in this

458
0:19:45.72,000 --> 0:19:49,000
context of loneliness are there people

459
0:19:48.36,000 --> 0:19:51,000
that I'm reaching out to that I maybe

460
0:19:50.04,000 --> 0:19:57,000
haven't spoken to for a few years is

461
0:19:52.07,000 --> 0:19:59,000
there a way that I you know I have this

462
0:19:57.36,000 --> 0:20:01,000
really remarkable experience sometimes

463
0:19:59.73,000 --> 0:20:04,000
where I feel like even when we speaking

464
0:20:01.86,000 --> 0:20:06,000
to someone we speaking beyond the person

465
0:20:04.99,000 --> 0:20:09,000
um there's something beautiful that I do

466
0:20:07.21,000 --> 0:20:11,000
in one of my exercises that I've

467
0:20:10.12,000 --> 0:20:14,000
actually done in some TED workshops

468
0:20:11.44,000 --> 0:20:17,000
before where I asked people just to

469
0:20:14.2,000 --> 0:20:19,000
silently look at another person there's

470
0:20:17.529,000 --> 0:20:21,000
this beautiful phrase in South Africa

471
0:20:19.87,000 --> 0:20:23,000
summer bonnets are greeting that were

472
0:20:22.059,000 --> 0:20:28,000
born amines I see you and by seeing you

473
0:20:24.22,000 --> 0:20:3,000
I bring you into being and in the

474
0:20:28.51,000 --> 0:20:31,000
workshops sometimes what I do is I'll

475
0:20:30.22,000 --> 0:20:34,000
stop people and I cue them and I say

476
0:20:32.38,000 --> 0:20:38,000
Sabha Boehner and all I'm doing is I'm

477
0:20:34.659,000 --> 0:20:4,000
asking people to look beyond the eyes to

478
0:20:39.159,000 --> 0:20:43,000
look into the soul and the love and the

479
0:20:41.14,000 --> 0:20:45,000
light and the hurt in the person that's

480
0:20:43.57,000 --> 0:20:46,000
in front of you and I've been doing that

481
0:20:45.49,000 --> 0:20:48,000
with my children you know they don't

482
0:20:46.75,000 --> 0:20:5,000
necessarily love it but instead of doing

483
0:20:49.21,000 --> 0:20:52,000
the quick hug when they at the computer

484
0:20:51.1,000 --> 0:20:55,000
trying to do their learning each day I'm

485
0:20:52.779,000 --> 0:20:56,000
starting to say to them you know let's

486
0:20:55.539,000 --> 0:20:58,000
just look at each other

487
0:20:56.789,000 --> 0:21:02,000
it's just connect with each other let's

488
0:20:59.44,000 --> 0:21:04,000
be the person behind the person so I

489
0:21:03.61,000 --> 0:21:06,000
think that there ways that we can

490
0:21:05.14,000 --> 0:21:11,000
whether it's an online meeting with our

491
0:21:07.539,000 --> 0:21:12,000
colleagues or phoning someone that we

492
0:21:11.26,000 --> 0:21:16,000
care about or even how we look at a

493
0:21:13.24,000 --> 0:21:18,000
person there is meaning that brings us

494
0:21:17.049,000 --> 0:21:21,000
out of loneliness and meaning that

495
0:21:19.12,000 --> 0:21:24,000
brings us out of social isolation in

496
0:21:21.49,000 --> 0:21:27,000
ways that are really profound and

497
0:21:24.46,000 --> 0:21:29,000
beautiful I just wanted to nip in with a

498
0:21:28.029,000 --> 0:21:34,000
couple of questions from the where out

499
0:21:29.74,000 --> 0:21:35,000
of people who were watching so I'm

500
0:21:34.39,000 --> 0:21:37,000
thinking especially I think some people

501
0:21:36.13,000 --> 0:21:39,000
watching you know literally in a

502
0:21:37.75,000 --> 0:21:43,000
situation now where they they have spent

503
0:21:40.09,000 --> 0:21:47,000
days alone and it's a fearful it's a

504
0:21:43.84,000 --> 0:21:49,000
fearful time and so one question is you

505
0:21:47.679,000 --> 0:21:53,000
know what do you mean when you say reach

506
0:21:50.77,000 --> 0:21:57,000
inside of us to find courage how do you

507
0:21:54.1,000 --> 0:22:01,000
actually do that well firstly what we

508
0:21:58.27,000 --> 0:22:03,000
know is the way fear operates so when

509
0:22:01.21,000 --> 0:22:05,000
people are feeling fearful or when the

510
0:22:03.34,000 --> 0:22:06,000
situation is ambiguous as it as it is

511
0:22:05.74,000 --> 0:22:08,000
right now

512
0:22:06.57,000 --> 0:22:13,000
usually what we try to do and this is

513
0:22:09.34,000 --> 0:22:15,000
literally a cognitive reality for us is

514
0:22:14.2,000 --> 0:22:17,000
that our mind tries to fill in the

515
0:22:16.33,000 --> 0:22:18,000
blanks so we don't know the answers and

516
0:22:18.13,000 --> 0:22:2,000
we

517
0:22:18.61,000 --> 0:22:22,000
try to fill in the blank so we mat

518
0:22:20.799,000 --> 0:22:25,000
catastrophize or we might you know

519
0:22:23.44,000 --> 0:22:28,000
develop huge amounts of anxiety or we go

520
0:22:26.44,000 --> 0:22:3,000
to our Twitter feed in search of the

521
0:22:28.72,000 --> 0:22:33,000
answers and often what that does is it

522
0:22:31.39,000 --> 0:22:35,000
actually provokes the very opposite of

523
0:22:33.85,000 --> 0:22:38,000
what we need what that provokes is it

524
0:22:36.28,000 --> 0:22:41,000
often provokes more anxiety more fear

525
0:22:39.4,000 --> 0:22:44,000
and more you know we talk about viruses

526
0:22:41.77,000 --> 0:22:45,000
and we talk about physical contagion um

527
0:22:44.5,000 --> 0:22:49,000
but we also know that people can

528
0:22:46.51,000 --> 0:22:51,000
experience very real levels of emotional

529
0:22:49.54,000 --> 0:22:53,000
contagion emotional contagion is when

530
0:22:52.059,000 --> 0:22:57,000
you in subtle ways pick up on the

531
0:22:54.13,000 --> 0:23:,000
emotions of other people because as

532
0:22:57.85,000 --> 0:23:03,000
human beings again we've evolved to pick

533
0:23:00.61,000 --> 0:23:05,000
up on these cues and so I think you know

534
0:23:04.24,000 --> 0:23:08,000
when I'm saying reach inside of yourself

535
0:23:06.04,000 --> 0:23:11,000
when we think about intentionality

536
0:23:08.76,000 --> 0:23:14,000
intentionality is this idea that rather

537
0:23:11.77,000 --> 0:23:17,000
than being mindlessly sucked into our

538
0:23:15.61,000 --> 0:23:2,000
experience which I have been - you know

539
0:23:18.13,000 --> 0:23:22,000
this is this is a common common human

540
0:23:20.89,000 --> 0:23:22,000
experience we get sucked into our news

541
0:23:22.87,000 --> 0:23:24,000
feeds

542
0:23:23.35,000 --> 0:23:29,000
instead we're starting to ask ourselves

543
0:23:25.36,000 --> 0:23:32,000
questions of is this helping me and is

544
0:23:29.83,000 --> 0:23:34,000
this some alternative way that I can be

545
0:23:32.59,000 --> 0:23:37,000
engaging so I've had lots of people

546
0:23:35.669,000 --> 0:23:4,000
contact me recently just saying things

547
0:23:38.29,000 --> 0:23:43,000
that you know I I've just taken such joy

548
0:23:41.559,000 --> 0:23:47,000
in creating a little garden for myself I

549
0:23:44.049,000 --> 0:23:49,000
have gotten a list of books that I

550
0:23:47.559,000 --> 0:23:51,000
really wanted to read and I haven't I've

551
0:23:49.95,000 --> 0:23:54,000
reached out a friend who I haven't

552
0:23:52.39,000 --> 0:23:56,000
spoken to for years and where we had

553
0:23:55.179,000 --> 0:23:57,000
some silly argument about something and

554
0:23:57.01,000 --> 0:24:01,000
we can't even remember what that

555
0:23:58.09,000 --> 0:24:04,000
argument was but I now know that whether

556
0:24:01.33,000 --> 0:24:06,000
I'm right or wrong doesn't matter more

557
0:24:04.54,000 --> 0:24:09,000
than a more important question which is

558
0:24:06.46,000 --> 0:24:12,000
is my actions serving me is it serving

559
0:24:09.85,000 --> 0:24:14,000
the person the loved one that the human

560
0:24:12.82,000 --> 0:24:15,000
being that I must want to be so if we

561
0:24:15.04,000 --> 0:24:18,000
can start reaching inside ourselves and

562
0:24:16.69,000 --> 0:24:21,000
saying you know what are ways that I can

563
0:24:18.85,000 --> 0:24:23,000
if I'm lonely how can I contribute how

564
0:24:21.94,000 --> 0:24:26,000
can i connect what are ways that I can

565
0:24:24.28,000 --> 0:24:29,000
come to my experience though that it's

566
0:24:27.58,000 --> 0:24:32,000
intentional and its values connected and

567
0:24:30.25,000 --> 0:24:35,000
also if you feel

568
0:24:32.81,000 --> 0:24:37,000
and so many of us are also be

569
0:24:35.72,000 --> 0:24:4,000
compassionate with that this this is

570
0:24:37.91,000 --> 0:24:41,000
tough we often live our lives as if we

571
0:24:40.79,000 --> 0:24:43,000
in a never-ending Ironman or an woman

572
0:24:42.86,000 --> 0:24:46,000
competition you know where we've got to

573
0:24:44.33,000 --> 0:24:48,000
have goals and be healthy and be fit and

574
0:24:47.09,000 --> 0:24:5,000
be there all these things that we feel

575
0:24:49.04,000 --> 0:24:52,000
we've got to do every single day we've

576
0:24:50.66,000 --> 0:24:55,000
got to be the best leaders we've got to

577
0:24:52.1,000 --> 0:24:58,000
be I think just you know breathing into

578
0:24:55.94,000 --> 0:24:59,000
the experience is really important there

579
0:24:58.46,000 --> 0:25:01,000
are other practical things that we can

580
0:24:59.99,000 --> 0:25:05,000
do in relation to this experience as

581
0:25:02.45,000 --> 0:25:12,000
well and often we use this language we

582
0:25:06.62,000 --> 0:25:15,000
say I am lonely I am sad I am angry and

583
0:25:13.1,000 --> 0:25:19,000
it's a normal default way that we

584
0:25:16.48,000 --> 0:25:2,000
describe how we feeling but if we think

585
0:25:19.49,000 --> 0:25:26,000
about the language of that what we doing

586
0:25:21.38,000 --> 0:25:31,000
is we are saying I am all of me 100% of

587
0:25:26.96,000 --> 0:25:33,000
me is the singular experience I am sad

588
0:25:32.29,000 --> 0:25:36,000
but what are you starting to do when you

589
0:25:34.94,000 --> 0:25:37,000
use that language is we do it

590
0:25:37.19,000 --> 0:25:41,000
unintentionally but what we started to

591
0:25:38.66,000 --> 0:25:46,000
do is we starting to define ourselves by

592
0:25:41.36,000 --> 0:25:5,000
our emotion we are not our emotion we

593
0:25:47.63,000 --> 0:25:54,000
own our emotions they don't own and

594
0:25:50.78,000 --> 0:25:56,000
define us what we want to do is we want

595
0:25:55.07,000 --> 0:26:,000
to show up to our emotions with

596
0:25:57.46,000 --> 0:26:02,000
compassion and curiosity but we also

597
0:26:00.56,000 --> 0:26:05,000
don't want to get stuck in our emotions

598
0:26:02.95,000 --> 0:26:07,000
though simple strategies that can be

599
0:26:05.63,000 --> 0:26:11,000
really helpful to people is instead of

600
0:26:08.24,000 --> 0:26:14,000
saying I am sad label your thoughts your

601
0:26:12.53,000 --> 0:26:18,000
emotions or your feelings for what they

602
0:26:14.63,000 --> 0:26:21,000
are they are not back there are thoughts

603
0:26:18.77,000 --> 0:26:23,000
there are emotions their feelings so you

604
0:26:21.77,000 --> 0:26:28,000
might say something like I'm noticing

605
0:26:24.52,000 --> 0:26:33,000
the feeling that I'm said I'm noticing

606
0:26:29.02,000 --> 0:26:37,000
the urge to shut down the conversation

607
0:26:33.59,000 --> 0:26:4,000
with my spouse or I'm noticing the urge

608
0:26:37.25,000 --> 0:26:41,000
to keep going on my social media feed

609
0:26:40.91,000 --> 0:26:43,000
right now

610
0:26:41.6,000 --> 0:26:45,000
I'm noticing the thought that things are

611
0:26:44.6,000 --> 0:26:47,000
never gonna get any better

612
0:26:45.81,000 --> 0:26:49,000
what you start doing when you this is a

613
0:26:48.09,000 --> 0:26:52,000
mindfulness technique but what you're

614
0:26:49.89,000 --> 0:26:54,000
really doing is you are labeling your

615
0:26:52.71,000 --> 0:26:56,000
thoughts your emotions your feelings as

616
0:26:54.96,000 --> 0:26:58,000
thoughts emotions feelings and when you

617
0:26:57.45,000 --> 0:27:,000
do this what you start doing is you

618
0:26:59.04,000 --> 0:27:04,000
create that space that I spoke about

619
0:27:01.19,000 --> 0:27:06,000
between stimulus and response no longer

620
0:27:04.35,000 --> 0:27:08,000
are you defined if you are now able to

621
0:27:06.21,000 --> 0:27:11,000
see them for what they are and then you

622
0:27:08.58,000 --> 0:27:14,000
can start saying I'm noticing that I'm

623
0:27:11.55,000 --> 0:27:17,000
feeling sad what is that telling me

624
0:27:14.67,000 --> 0:27:2,000
about what I care about and how can I

625
0:27:17.67,000 --> 0:27:21,000
bring more of the thing into my life and

626
0:27:20.79,000 --> 0:27:22,000
it's going to be different for different

627
0:27:21.72,000 --> 0:27:24,000
people are you mentioned there about

628
0:27:23.22,000 --> 0:27:27,000
contribution and about compassion I

629
0:27:25.71,000 --> 0:27:29,000
wonder is it the case the two things

630
0:27:27.93,000 --> 0:27:31,000
first of all how can people help like

631
0:27:29.85,000 --> 0:27:33,000
practically how can they help others

632
0:27:31.98,000 --> 0:27:35,000
when we're all in this isolated world

633
0:27:34.56,000 --> 0:27:39,000
right now but secondly can that can that

634
0:27:36.96,000 --> 0:27:41,000
process itself actually help people that

635
0:27:39.57,000 --> 0:27:42,000
shifting from feeling the pain to act to

636
0:27:42.18,000 --> 0:27:44,000
the sort of the agency and they're

637
0:27:43.23,000 --> 0:27:46,000
reaching out and try to do something for

638
0:27:44.46,000 --> 0:27:47,000
data can that make a difference yes it's

639
0:27:46.74,000 --> 0:27:5,000
such an important question it's this

640
0:27:48.15,000 --> 0:27:53,000
thing of sama buona ICU but in seeing

641
0:27:51.06,000 --> 0:27:55,000
myself I'm able to see others to this

642
0:27:53.4,000 --> 0:27:58,000
profoundly important way of seeing

643
0:27:55.83,000 --> 0:28:,000
others and yes you know finding ways

644
0:27:59.37,000 --> 0:28:02,000
that you can contribute there are so

645
0:28:01.08,000 --> 0:28:05,000
many people in pain right now there are

646
0:28:03.09,000 --> 0:28:09,000
people who are in their houses who

647
0:28:05.79,000 --> 0:28:12,000
haven't spoken to another soul for days

648
0:28:09.87,000 --> 0:28:16,000
there are people who need help with

649
0:28:13.55,000 --> 0:28:19,000
essential groceries and services they

650
0:28:17.04,000 --> 0:28:23,000
are chuk keepers who are struggling and

651
0:28:19.65,000 --> 0:28:25,000
so within our community instead of

652
0:28:23.4,000 --> 0:28:27,000
spending our time you know trying to get

653
0:28:26.16,000 --> 0:28:3,000
stucked or or trying to stop ourselves

654
0:28:27.84,000 --> 0:28:31,000
even from being in the sabor ticks which

655
0:28:30.81,000 --> 0:28:33,000
I think the so many of us is that

656
0:28:32.22,000 --> 0:28:36,000
experience is really thinking about what

657
0:28:34.59,000 --> 0:28:39,000
are practical ways that we can do it and

658
0:28:36.93,000 --> 0:28:4,000
what is what's what's so true for us as

659
0:28:39.9,000 --> 0:28:42,000
human beings is we often think that in

660
0:28:41.49,000 --> 0:28:44,000
order to make a contribution we've got

661
0:28:43.8,000 --> 0:28:46,000
to do something huge

662
0:28:45.27,000 --> 0:28:51,000
it's got to be grand it's got to be

663
0:28:47.25,000 --> 0:28:53,000
massive scale but you know if we think

664
0:28:51.45,000 --> 0:28:55,000
about the need to belong every single

665
0:28:53.52,000 --> 0:28:58,000
one of us needs to belong and we know

666
0:28:56.34,000 --> 0:29:02,000
that we can have one other person's pain

667
0:28:59.47,000 --> 0:29:06,000
just by being that persons person today

668
0:29:02.58,000 --> 0:29:09,000
that might just be a phone call but if

669
0:29:06.7,000 --> 0:29:11,000
we can reach beyond ourselves that's

670
0:29:1,000 --> 0:29:13,000
healing for others and it's healing for

671
0:29:11.95,000 --> 0:29:14,000
ourselves as well and so this is often

672
0:29:13.84,000 --> 0:29:17,000
not about these big things it's often

673
0:29:15.64,000 --> 0:29:21,000
about what I call tiny tweaks more

674
0:29:18.36,000 --> 0:29:24,000
values connected actions that we can

675
0:29:22.059,000 --> 0:29:27,000
take that are committed and and even you

676
0:29:24.97,000 --> 0:29:3,000
know being at home being physically

677
0:29:27.58,000 --> 0:29:32,000
distant there's this courage

678
0:29:31.39,000 --> 0:29:34,000
there's courage in doing that I mean

679
0:29:32.89,000 --> 0:29:35,000
we're doing it because we know that it's

680
0:29:34.9,000 --> 0:29:37,000
the right thing but there's also courage

681
0:29:36.52,000 --> 0:29:42,000
in looking inside of ourselves and and

682
0:29:38.86,000 --> 0:29:45,000
and owning that you're doing that not

683
0:29:42.58,000 --> 0:29:47,000
only because you have to but because

684
0:29:45.94,000 --> 0:29:49,000
that is something that is profoundly

685
0:29:48.45,000 --> 0:29:51,000
important that you care about others and

686
0:29:50.799,000 --> 0:29:53,000
I think actually this is also a

687
0:29:52.33,000 --> 0:29:56,000
conversation to be having with children

688
0:29:53.98,000 --> 0:29:57,000
right now you know I think you know

689
0:29:56.5,000 --> 0:29:58,000
often what happens with our kids is we

690
0:29:58.09,000 --> 0:30:,000
say well these are the rules

691
0:29:59.26,000 --> 0:30:03,000
you know this is what we've got to do

692
0:30:00.669,000 --> 0:30:04,000
now but what are we doing we're really

693
0:30:03.37,000 --> 0:30:07,000
trying to help our children develop

694
0:30:05.53,000 --> 0:30:09,000
their own sense of values and character

695
0:30:07.75,000 --> 0:30:12,000
and so we can start doing this by

696
0:30:10.15,000 --> 0:30:15,000
showing up to our children's emotions

697
0:30:13.14,000 --> 0:30:17,000
how are you feeling instead of kind of

698
0:30:15.7,000 --> 0:30:18,000
you know say everything's going to be a

699
0:30:17.289,000 --> 0:30:2,000
cage I worry about it and try brush over

700
0:30:19.33,000 --> 0:30:22,000
it our children are feeling what they're

701
0:30:20.74,000 --> 0:30:24,000
feeling if we can shut those feelings

702
0:30:22.659,000 --> 0:30:28,000
with compassion but then also ask our

703
0:30:24.88,000 --> 0:30:33,000
children you know what are ways that you

704
0:30:29.32,000 --> 0:30:34,000
think you can bring yourself to your

705
0:30:33.94,000 --> 0:30:36,000
friends

706
0:30:34.63,000 --> 0:30:38,000
what are your connections or how always

707
0:30:37.48,000 --> 0:30:39,000
that you are living right now connected

708
0:30:39.37,000 --> 0:30:46,000
with who you want to be as a person

709
0:30:40.39,000 --> 0:30:47,000
these are incredible times for us we

710
0:30:46.45,000 --> 0:30:49,000
didn't ask for them but we are

711
0:30:47.919,000 --> 0:30:5,000
developing our resilience and our

712
0:30:49.51,000 --> 0:30:53,000
character and the character of those

713
0:30:51.1,000 --> 0:30:55,000
around us without a doubt so your last

714
0:30:53.74,000 --> 0:30:56,000
comment about children and how you can

715
0:30:55.87,000 --> 0:30:58,000
really have conversations with them

716
0:30:57.429,000 --> 0:31:,000
about what's going on you know a lot of

717
0:30:59.26,000 --> 0:31:02,000
them may be experiencing some of the

718
0:31:01.03,000 --> 0:31:04,000
same emotions that that we're all

719
0:31:02.789,000 --> 0:31:05,000
experiencing but maybe with a little

720
0:31:04.69,000 --> 0:31:08,000
more confusion because they have less

721
0:31:06.549,000 --> 0:31:1,000
life experience and so how can we talk

722
0:31:09.399,000 --> 0:31:12,000
to children if you're if there are

723
0:31:10.84,000 --> 0:31:13,000
parents out there about what's going

724
0:31:13.299,000 --> 0:31:17,000
out there and how they can deal with

725
0:31:14.649,000 --> 0:31:19,000
their emotions the most important thing

726
0:31:17.83,000 --> 0:31:21,000
we know you know spoke about instead of

727
0:31:19.69,000 --> 0:31:23,000
saying I am said you noticing that you

728
0:31:22.509,000 --> 0:31:26,000
feeling said another very very important

729
0:31:24.61,000 --> 0:31:29,000
part of being effective with our

730
0:31:26.559,000 --> 0:31:31,000
emotions is being granular with our

731
0:31:29.83,000 --> 0:31:34,000
emotions and what I mean when I say

732
0:31:32.049,000 --> 0:31:37,000
being granule is often we use very big

733
0:31:35.009,000 --> 0:31:4,000
labels to describe my emotions you know

734
0:31:37.84,000 --> 0:31:41,000
people might say I'm stressed dressed

735
0:31:40.419,000 --> 0:31:45,000
I'm stressed that's the most common one

736
0:31:42.369,000 --> 0:31:46,000
that I hear um you know in in my work

737
0:31:45.669,000 --> 0:31:47,000
and the work that I'm doing in

738
0:31:46.659,000 --> 0:31:49,000
organizations very often people sound

739
0:31:48.249,000 --> 0:31:52,000
stressed but there's a world of

740
0:31:50.2,000 --> 0:31:54,000
difference between stress and

741
0:31:52.529,000 --> 0:31:58,000
disappointment or stress and overwhelm

742
0:31:55.09,000 --> 0:32:02,000
or stress and yeah and what we know

743
0:31:59.32,000 --> 0:32:05,000
psychologically is when we label our

744
0:32:02.32,000 --> 0:32:08,000
emotions in a more granular way when we

745
0:32:05.59,000 --> 0:32:12,000
move beyond the I am stressed into what

746
0:32:08.649,000 --> 0:32:15,000
is this emotion really then what it does

747
0:32:12.97,000 --> 0:32:18,000
is it helps us again move into that

748
0:32:16.45,000 --> 0:32:2,000
space of ourselves and it doesn't think

749
0:32:19.629,000 --> 0:32:22,000
really powerful in our brains that

750
0:32:20.799,000 --> 0:32:25,000
starts helping us to understand what is

751
0:32:23.499,000 --> 0:32:27,000
the cause of the emotion and what is the

752
0:32:26.2,000 --> 0:32:31,000
pathway forward so we're now moving

753
0:32:28.419,000 --> 0:32:34,000
beyond this are it all feels stress into

754
0:32:31.389,000 --> 0:32:36,000
this is overwhelm I can do something

755
0:32:34.57,000 --> 0:32:41,000
with overwhelm I can create pockets of

756
0:32:36.94,000 --> 0:32:43,000
control okay if my stress is lonely I

757
0:32:41.889,000 --> 0:32:45,000
can look for opportunities to each other

758
0:32:44.44,000 --> 0:32:48,000
so emotion granularity is really

759
0:32:46.239,000 --> 0:32:52,000
important when it comes to children the

760
0:32:48.639,000 --> 0:32:55,000
same applies we often as parents with

761
0:32:52.509,000 --> 0:32:58,000
really really good intentions want to

762
0:32:55.809,000 --> 0:33:01,000
just jump in and say you know the child

763
0:32:58.57,000 --> 0:33:04,000
says mommy I'm worried you know don't

764
0:33:01.869,000 --> 0:33:05,000
worry it'll be okay and again I take

765
0:33:04.57,000 --> 0:33:09,000
that lesson of my father you know it's

766
0:33:06.369,000 --> 0:33:13,000
normal to be scared what we know for our

767
0:33:10.09,000 --> 0:33:19,000
children is simply showing up to them

768
0:33:13.649,000 --> 0:33:21,000
simply being them and holding space for

769
0:33:19.389,000 --> 0:33:25,000
them to feel what they feel is probably

770
0:33:22.629,000 --> 0:33:26,000
the most important way that children can

771
0:33:25.929,000 --> 0:33:28,000
develop a sense of

772
0:33:26.83,000 --> 0:33:32,000
security in the context of chaos so

773
0:33:29.919,000 --> 0:33:37,000
that's the showing apart the second part

774
0:33:33.159,000 --> 0:33:4,000
is again we are wanting children to feel

775
0:33:38.019,000 --> 0:33:42,000
that their emotions don't own them when

776
0:33:40.659,000 --> 0:33:43,000
we set a kid's like I don't worry

777
0:33:42.25,000 --> 0:33:46,000
everything will be okay or just be happy

778
0:33:44.169,000 --> 0:33:48,000
what are we teaching we teaching that

779
0:33:46.659,000 --> 0:33:49,000
some emotions are good and some emotions

780
0:33:48.429,000 --> 0:33:52,000
are bad and that the bad ones should be

781
0:33:50.649,000 --> 0:33:55,000
done away with and so when we do that

782
0:33:53.11,000 --> 0:33:59,000
very often children don't get practice

783
0:33:55.87,000 --> 0:34:01,000
with feeling what a difficult emotion

784
0:33:59.11,000 --> 0:34:05,000
feels like and better don't then develop

785
0:34:01.99,000 --> 0:34:07,000
the the the strength and the capacity

786
0:34:06.07,000 --> 0:34:1,000
the psychological resource that that

787
0:34:08.379,000 --> 0:34:12,000
builds the winner child is feeling what

788
0:34:10.629,000 --> 0:34:14,000
they're feeling that's what they're

789
0:34:12.7,000 --> 0:34:19,000
feeling if we can show up to that with

790
0:34:15.429,000 --> 0:34:22,000
compassion that in of itself is probably

791
0:34:19.99,000 --> 0:34:23,000
the most powerful thing then another

792
0:34:22.839,000 --> 0:34:25,000
thing that we can do is we can start

793
0:34:24.099,000 --> 0:34:26,000
helping their child to label their

794
0:34:26.139,000 --> 0:34:29,000
emotions

795
0:34:26.8,000 --> 0:34:3,000
we know that children as young as 2 or 3

796
0:34:29.47,000 --> 0:34:32,000
years old are able to start

797
0:34:30.82,000 --> 0:34:37,000
differentiating between angry versus

798
0:34:33.399,000 --> 0:34:4,000
said I feel rejected or I feel it's

799
0:34:38.109,000 --> 0:34:43,000
unfair okay so so children are starting

800
0:34:40.99,000 --> 0:34:44,000
to develop this language and when our

801
0:34:43.419,000 --> 0:34:46,000
children are going through difficulties

802
0:34:45.22,000 --> 0:34:51,000
we can help them to do that like is it

803
0:34:47.379,000 --> 0:34:54,000
that you feeling you know stressed here

804
0:34:51.339,000 --> 0:34:56,000
or is it that you scared are you lonely

805
0:34:54.49,000 --> 0:34:59,000
are you you know what is it that's going

806
0:34:56.47,000 --> 0:35:01,000
on for you sir helping our children to

807
0:34:59.71,000 --> 0:35:03,000
step out of their emotions so that those

808
0:35:02.109,000 --> 0:35:06,000
emotions are data but they're not

809
0:35:04.24,000 --> 0:35:08,000
directives they're data they're telling

810
0:35:06.25,000 --> 0:35:11,000
us what we need but they're not calling

811
0:35:09.099,000 --> 0:35:13,000
the shots and then we can start helping

812
0:35:11.38,000 --> 0:35:15,000
our children to say so what is it that

813
0:35:13.54,000 --> 0:35:19,000
you need right now you know do you need

814
0:35:16.24,000 --> 0:35:23,000
us to organize a facebook conversation

815
0:35:20.38,000 --> 0:35:26,000
with a friend but at the end of the day

816
0:35:23.44,000 --> 0:35:28,000
all of us every single person listening

817
0:35:26.71,000 --> 0:35:31,000
every single person who will be

818
0:35:28.48,000 --> 0:35:35,000
listening every one of us is doing the

819
0:35:32.68,000 --> 0:35:37,000
best we can with who we are with what

820
0:35:36.099,000 --> 0:35:4,000
we've got and with the resources that we

821
0:35:38.619,000 --> 0:35:41,000
have available to us

822
0:35:40.42,000 --> 0:35:44,000
the most important thing that we can do

823
0:35:42.25,000 --> 0:35:47,000
with ourselves and it will then be role

824
0:35:45.069,000 --> 0:35:49,000
models to our children is to be

825
0:35:47.799,000 --> 0:35:51,000
compassionate with yourself

826
0:35:49.48,000 --> 0:35:54,000
and that moves us into the space instead

827
0:35:52.51,000 --> 0:35:59,000
of of judgment and not enough and never

828
0:35:55.329,000 --> 0:36:03,000
enough into the space of being and

829
0:36:00.03,000 --> 0:36:06,000
resilience and grace and dignity some

830
0:36:04.24,000 --> 0:36:07,000
people are asking almost not so much

831
0:36:06.28,000 --> 0:36:09,000
about you know fear and depression but

832
0:36:08.049,000 --> 0:36:12,000
about just just focus like people who

833
0:36:10.119,000 --> 0:36:17,000
have had their academic life their year

834
0:36:12.4,000 --> 0:36:2,000
has been disrupted what can I do to find

835
0:36:17.26,000 --> 0:36:22,000
any focus and to pay attention to yeah I

836
0:36:21.13,000 --> 0:36:26,000
mean life is right now

837
0:36:22.69,000 --> 0:36:28,000
conspiring conspiring against any kind

838
0:36:26.38,000 --> 0:36:31,000
of focus and at the same time you know

839
0:36:29.26,000 --> 0:36:34,000
we've almost got all of us as a science

840
0:36:31.45,000 --> 0:36:37,000
society like a forced amount a forced

841
0:36:34.329,000 --> 0:36:4,000
time of needing to read galvanize

842
0:36:38.349,000 --> 0:36:43,000
ourselves and so I think for every

843
0:36:40.78,000 --> 0:36:44,000
person first do you recognizing what are

844
0:36:44.2,000 --> 0:36:48,000
some of the things that you are doing

845
0:36:45.579,000 --> 0:36:5,000
that are unintentionally sucking

846
0:36:48.839,000 --> 0:36:53,000
literally sucking the life out of your

847
0:36:51.369,000 --> 0:36:57,000
day um it might be it might be the

848
0:36:54.52,000 --> 0:37:,000
constantly checking the numbers it might

849
0:36:57.91,000 --> 0:37:01,000
be you know going down a rabbit hole of

850
0:37:00.7,000 --> 0:37:05,000
epidemiological studies there are

851
0:37:02.799,000 --> 0:37:07,000
different ways that we are just having

852
0:37:05.77,000 --> 0:37:1,000
this conspiring against our attentional

853
0:37:08.68,000 --> 0:37:12,000
resources and again you know trying to

854
0:37:10.99,000 --> 0:37:13,000
navigate what's going on with children

855
0:37:13.27,000 --> 0:37:17,000
and with both elderly parents there's

856
0:37:14.98,000 --> 0:37:17,000
just so much going on I think you know

857
0:37:17.38,000 --> 0:37:22,000
one of the most important things that we

858
0:37:18.73,000 --> 0:37:26,000
can do it is as far as you can try to

859
0:37:22.96,000 --> 0:37:28,000
establish pockets of control you know

860
0:37:27.13,000 --> 0:37:31,000
there's lots that's out of our control

861
0:37:29.26,000 --> 0:37:35,000
we we don't control almost all of us

862
0:37:31.96,000 --> 0:37:39,000
what can we control we control how we

863
0:37:35.71,000 --> 0:37:43,000
respond we can control how we connect

864
0:37:40.15,000 --> 0:37:47,000
and we control how we are to the best of

865
0:37:44.38,000 --> 0:37:51,000
our ability able to segment our time off

866
0:37:47.89,000 --> 0:37:53,000
so if for you that means that your

867
0:37:51.49,000 --> 0:37:56,000
control that day is simply making and

868
0:37:54.28,000 --> 0:38:01,000
of what food is going to be on the table

869
0:37:56.98,000 --> 0:38:04,000
or whether that control is putting your

870
0:38:01.84,000 --> 0:38:08,000
cell phone in a drawer for an hour every

871
0:38:05.71,000 --> 0:38:11,000
day or whether the control is you know

872
0:38:09.75,000 --> 0:38:14,000
shutting something else so we we're

873
0:38:12.52,000 --> 0:38:17,000
family we love music and we we always

874
0:38:15.13,000 --> 0:38:19,000
dancing around the kitchen and you know

875
0:38:17.83,000 --> 0:38:21,000
we love and you know that's one way that

876
0:38:20.08,000 --> 0:38:25,000
we bring joy to our lives but I've

877
0:38:22.36,000 --> 0:38:28,000
actually been finding that there's so

878
0:38:25.21,000 --> 0:38:31,000
much joy is in general that for me the

879
0:38:29.26,000 --> 0:38:33,000
control is actually the control of

880
0:38:31.39,000 --> 0:38:35,000
exerting some kind of silence in the

881
0:38:34.21,000 --> 0:38:39,000
environment wherever it's possible I

882
0:38:35.77,000 --> 0:38:42,000
haven't left the house for two weeks and

883
0:38:39.39,000 --> 0:38:44,000
the first week was absolutely you know

884
0:38:43.21,000 --> 0:38:46,000
it was chaotic with all of the stuff

885
0:38:44.89,000 --> 0:38:48,000
going on and I found for me being able

886
0:38:46.99,000 --> 0:38:5,000
to just think about okay if this lands

887
0:38:49.57,000 --> 0:38:53,000
up being some kind of forced sabbatical

888
0:38:51.85,000 --> 0:38:56,000
that I don't ask for but if that's what

889
0:38:54.4,000 --> 0:39:,000
it is what are the three or four things

890
0:38:57.19,000 --> 0:39:03,000
that I need to be doing everyday that

891
0:39:00.79,000 --> 0:39:06,000
are going to create some kind of routine

892
0:39:03.22,000 --> 0:39:1,000
and what are ways that I can think of

893
0:39:07.36,000 --> 0:39:11,000
other projects that I want to do so we

894
0:39:10.24,000 --> 0:39:15,000
created some kind of routine for my

895
0:39:11.95,000 --> 0:39:17,000
children and and it's not perfect none

896
0:39:15.25,000 --> 0:39:19,000
of us is perfect but it is what it is

897
0:39:18.07,000 --> 0:39:21,000
it's these pockets of control that give

898
0:39:19.93,000 --> 0:39:22,000
us back our sense of agency and that's

899
0:39:21.52,000 --> 0:39:24,000
really critical so so these

900
0:39:23.2,000 --> 0:39:27,000
conversations are very high on the

901
0:39:24.67,000 --> 0:39:28,000
Maslow pyramid how do we who have the

902
0:39:27.55,000 --> 0:39:31,000
privilege to have these conversations

903
0:39:29.25,000 --> 0:39:33,000
support those who are out working on the

904
0:39:32.08,000 --> 0:39:36,000
front lines who don't have the luxury of

905
0:39:33.82,000 --> 0:39:35,000
taking time for introspection that's

906
0:39:36.13,000 --> 0:39:39,000
exactly right

907
0:39:36.73,000 --> 0:39:4,000
every single one of us has very very

908
0:39:39.16,000 --> 0:39:44,000
different circumstances and like you

909
0:39:41.47,000 --> 0:39:46,000
know I've been thinking so much about

910
0:39:44.94,000 --> 0:39:49,000
individuals for instance who might be in

911
0:39:47.05,000 --> 0:39:53,000
situations of domestic abuse or where

912
0:39:50.91,000 --> 0:39:57,000
children are feeling physically unsafe

913
0:39:53.5,000 --> 0:40:03,000
and we're going to school was was

914
0:39:58.36,000 --> 0:40:07,000
literally what was saving that child

915
0:40:04.33,000 --> 0:40:11,000
and this this is where my heart goes to

916
0:40:07.75,000 --> 0:40:12,000
you know this is where our connecting

917
0:40:11.59,000 --> 0:40:15,000
with others you know there things that

918
0:40:13.09,000 --> 0:40:19,000
we can do that can be helpful there are

919
0:40:16.02,000 --> 0:40:22,000
crisis tech slides that are currently

920
0:40:19.21,000 --> 0:40:26,000
looking for people who are available to

921
0:40:22.57,000 --> 0:40:3,000
be a helpful ear to individuals there

922
0:40:26.5,000 --> 0:40:33,000
are ways that we can support businesses

923
0:40:31.24,000 --> 0:40:36,000
you know is that is there a way that we

924
0:40:33.97,000 --> 0:40:37,000
can buy gift cards to but I mean these

925
0:40:36.31,000 --> 0:40:4,000
are these are very practical and micro

926
0:40:38.77,000 --> 0:40:43,000
suggestions but I think that they they

927
0:40:41.29,000 --> 0:40:46,000
important because there is real

928
0:40:43.99,000 --> 0:40:48,000
suffering and this is not just about you

929
0:40:46.51,000 --> 0:40:52,000
know how can I move myself into a higher

930
0:40:49.33,000 --> 0:40:54,000
plane of being and compassion and

931
0:40:52.66,000 --> 0:40:57,000
restoration because it's not I mean the

932
0:40:54.7,000 --> 0:41:03,000
reality for many many many people is

933
0:40:58.57,000 --> 0:41:06,000
that I don't have food in my house and

934
0:41:03.76,000 --> 0:41:09,000
this is why us coming together as

935
0:41:07.27,000 --> 0:41:13,000
community and being values connected and

936
0:41:10.63,000 --> 0:41:16,000
saying how can we help what a little big

937
0:41:13.81,000 --> 0:41:2,000
ways that we can help is is fundamental

938
0:41:17.26,000 --> 0:41:25,000
this this right now is the marker of our

939
0:41:21.07,000 --> 0:41:28,000
ability as humanity to come together and

940
0:41:25.51,000 --> 0:41:29,000
to fight back against this pandemic so

941
0:41:28.24,000 --> 0:41:31,000
putting the camera backs is and you as a

942
0:41:29.95,000 --> 0:41:34,000
as a psychologist looking at this

943
0:41:31.48,000 --> 0:41:36,000
overall situation you know people you

944
0:41:35.17,000 --> 0:41:38,000
can see things going into two ways

945
0:41:37.12,000 --> 0:41:4,000
because the world's conducting this

946
0:41:38.56,000 --> 0:41:43,000
massive psychological experiment we've

947
0:41:40.63,000 --> 0:41:45,000
never had done before you some people

948
0:41:43.81,000 --> 0:41:46,000
worry that we are going to drive each

949
0:41:46.18,000 --> 0:41:5,000
other crazy we're gonna we're gonna

950
0:41:47.41,000 --> 0:41:51,000
bring out so much fear and anger there's

951
0:41:50.35,000 --> 0:41:53,000
already a blame game going on between

952
0:41:52.27,000 --> 0:41:55,000
nations possibly between different

953
0:41:53.86,000 --> 0:41:57,000
communities that on some scenarios that

954
0:41:56.11,000 --> 0:42:,000
gets very dark on the other hand there

955
0:41:58.69,000 --> 0:42:02,000
are thousands and thousands of just

956
0:42:00.19,000 --> 0:42:04,000
amazing stories of help and love and

957
0:42:02.98,000 --> 0:42:05,000
creativity and people at which way is

958
0:42:05.05,000 --> 0:42:1,000
this going to go do you think do you

959
0:42:06.94,000 --> 0:42:12,000
think overall we are you know we're

960
0:42:10.3,000 --> 0:42:15,000
going to find a way of this persuading

961
0:42:13.72,000 --> 0:42:16,000
each other to be our better selves when

962
0:42:16.24,000 --> 0:42:18,000
we

963
0:42:17.11,000 --> 0:42:21,000
experience what in Psychological terms

964
0:42:19.06,000 --> 0:42:24,000
is called mortality salience mortality

965
0:42:22.09,000 --> 0:42:28,000
salience is this idea that our death

966
0:42:24.79,000 --> 0:42:3,000
becomes it's moved from something that

967
0:42:28.42,000 --> 0:42:32,000
we can conveniently avoid to something

968
0:42:31.33,000 --> 0:42:34,000
that is much more at the periphery even

969
0:42:32.95,000 --> 0:42:35,000
if we aren't directly infected or

970
0:42:35.11,000 --> 0:42:39,000
directly experiencing something it's

971
0:42:36.94,000 --> 0:42:4,000
much more salient to us and we know that

972
0:42:39.4,000 --> 0:42:43,000
when human beings have this mortality

973
0:42:41.56,000 --> 0:42:46,000
salience we tend to become much more as

974
0:42:44.14,000 --> 0:42:5,000
in them we tend to become more biased

975
0:42:47.2,000 --> 0:42:52,000
mysterious up there lot of predictable

976
0:42:50.32,000 --> 0:42:55,000
psychological responses when we

977
0:42:52.63,000 --> 0:42:58,000
experience this um but we also know that

978
0:42:55.39,000 --> 0:43:03,000
human beings have through time had a

979
0:42:59.32,000 --> 0:43:05,000
well of wisdom and humanity and you know

980
0:43:04,000 --> 0:43:08,000
what I would just say is I think that

981
0:43:05.5,000 --> 0:43:1,000
what so often happens is we try to solve

982
0:43:08.28,000 --> 0:43:12,000
the world's problems with our minds and

983
0:43:11.38,000 --> 0:43:14,000
of course we've got them this Minds out

984
0:43:13.24,000 --> 0:43:16,000
there working on and they should

985
0:43:14.38,000 --> 0:43:2,000
continue working on it and I think this

986
0:43:17.08,000 --> 0:43:24,000
is a time where we we actually need to

987
0:43:20.56,000 --> 0:43:28,000
move away from our minds into our hearts

988
0:43:24.94,000 --> 0:43:31,000
into our breathing our seeing our

989
0:43:28.9,000 --> 0:43:34,000
compassion our wisdom our fortitude and

990
0:43:32.64,000 --> 0:43:38,000
when I look at the research when I look

991
0:43:35.56,000 --> 0:43:42,000
at the psychology of generosity and

992
0:43:39.13,000 --> 0:43:45,000
helpers and community and you see that

993
0:43:43.48,000 --> 0:43:47,000
through history that there is this

994
0:43:45.91,000 --> 0:43:51,000
experience of human beings coming

995
0:43:47.68,000 --> 0:43:53,000
together I believe with all of me that

996
0:43:52.03,000 --> 0:43:56,000
we can but it comes through the place of

997
0:43:54.58,000 --> 0:43:59,000
being able to see ourselves and to see

998
0:43:56.92,000 --> 0:44:,000
the other introducer with compassion you

999
0:43:59.92,000 --> 0:44:04,000
know even the person who might be

1000
0:44:01.87,000 --> 0:44:07,000
hoarding toilet-paper compassion doesn't

1001
0:44:05.41,000 --> 0:44:1,000
mean that you agree that that person is

1002
0:44:08.68,000 --> 0:44:12,000
doing you know the right or the wrong

1003
0:44:10.78,000 --> 0:44:14,000
thing it's it's about moving beyond

1004
0:44:13.09,000 --> 0:44:18,000
right or wrong and it's saying you know

1005
0:44:15.46,000 --> 0:44:2,000
what is this person experiencing inside

1006
0:44:18.31,000 --> 0:44:22,000
of themselves that might be driving a

1007
0:44:20.8,000 --> 0:44:26,000
particular response that is this

1008
0:44:23.29,000 --> 0:44:29,000
openness of the beauty of who he can be

1009
0:44:27.79,000 --> 0:44:29,000
as human beings and I believe that we

1010
0:44:29.41,000 --> 0:44:32,000
can

1011
0:44:30.03,000 --> 0:44:35,000
and we'll do that and that that is the

1012
0:44:32.55,000 --> 0:44:37,000
sustainable way forward in what is a

1013
0:44:35.37,000 --> 0:44:39,000
fragile and beautiful world right now

1014
0:44:38.09,000 --> 0:44:41,000

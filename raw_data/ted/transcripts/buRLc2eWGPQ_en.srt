0:00:13.039,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Hello, TEDWomen, what's up.

2
0:00:14.786,000 --> 0:00:15,000
(Cheering)

3
0:00:16.075,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Not good enough.

4
0:00:17.515,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Hello, TEDWomen, what is up?

5
0:00:19.904,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Loud cheering)

6
0:00:21.849,000 --> 0:00:23,000
My name is Maysoon Zayid,

7
0:00:24.374,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and I am not drunk,

8
0:00:26.262,000 --> 0:00:28,000
but the doctor who delivered me was.

9
0:00:28.953,000 --> 0:00:31,000
He cut my mom six different times

10
0:00:32.507,000 --> 0:00:34,000
in six different directions,

11
0:00:35.317,000 --> 0:00:37,000
suffocating poor little me in the process.

12
0:00:37.935,000 --> 0:00:39,000
As a result, I have cerebral palsy,

13
0:00:40.577,000 --> 0:00:42,000
which means I shake all the time.

14
0:00:43.379,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Look.

15
0:00:46.006,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It's exhausting.

16
0:00:47.443,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I'm like Shakira, Shakira meets Muhammad Ali.

17
0:00:51.24,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:54.493,000 --> 0:00:55,000
CP is not genetic.

19
0:00:56.398,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It's not a birth defect. You can't catch it.

20
0:00:59.237,000 --> 0:01:02,000
No one put a curse on my mother's uterus,

21
0:01:02.435,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and I didn't get it because my parents are first cousins,

22
0:01:05.824,000 --> 0:01:06,000
which they are.

23
0:01:07.172,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:11.538,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It only happens from accidents,

25
0:01:13.752,000 --> 0:01:15,000
like what happened to me on my birth day.

26
0:01:16.306,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Now, I must warn you,

27
0:01:18.553,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I'm not inspirational.

28
0:01:20.472,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:21.497,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And I don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me,

30
0:01:25.467,000 --> 0:01:27,000
because at some point in your life,

31
0:01:27.697,000 --> 0:01:29,000
you have dreamt of being disabled.

32
0:01:30.887,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Come on a journey with me.

33
0:01:32.935,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It's Christmas Eve, you're at the mall,

34
0:01:36.073,000 --> 0:01:39,000
you're driving around in circles looking for parking,

35
0:01:39.389,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and what do you see?

36
0:01:41.435,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Sixteen empty handicapped spaces.

37
0:01:44.214,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:46.745,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And you're like, "God, can't I just be a little disabled?"

39
0:01:49.782,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:55.416,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Also, I've got to tell you,

41
0:01:57.019,000 --> 0:02:,000
I've got 99 problems, and palsy is just one.

42
0:02:00.715,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:01.762,000 --> 0:02:03,000
If there was an Oppression Olympics,

44
0:02:04.352,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I would win the gold medal.

45
0:02:06.109,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I'm Palestinian, Muslim,

46
0:02:09.266,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I'm female, I'm disabled,

47
0:02:11.614,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and I live in New Jersey.

48
0:02:13.507,000 --> 0:02:15,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:16.478,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Applause)

50
0:02:19.745,000 --> 0:02:21,000
If you don't feel better about yourself, maybe you should.

51
0:02:22.57,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:23.625,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Cliffside Park, New Jersey is my hometown.

53
0:02:25.976,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I have always loved the fact

54
0:02:28.573,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that my hood and my affliction share the same initials.

55
0:02:32.607,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I also love the fact

56
0:02:34.069,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City, I could.

57
0:02:37.764,000 --> 0:02:39,000
A lot of people with CP don't walk,

58
0:02:40.34,000 --> 0:02:42,000
but my parents didn't believe in "can't."

59
0:02:43.658,000 --> 0:02:44,000
My father's mantra was,

60
0:02:45.472,000 --> 0:02:48,000
"You can do it, yes you can can."

61
0:02:48.552,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

62
0:02:52.091,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So, if my three older sisters were mopping,

63
0:02:55.143,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I was mopping.

64
0:02:56.334,000 --> 0:02:58,000
If my three older sisters went to public school,

65
0:02:59.167,000 --> 0:03:,000
my parents would sue the school system

66
0:03:01.184,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and guarantee that I went too,

67
0:03:03.431,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and if we didn't all get A's,

68
0:03:05.221,000 --> 0:03:07,000
we all got my mother's slipper.

69
0:03:07.373,000 --> 0:03:09,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:10.177,000 --> 0:03:12,000
My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old

71
0:03:13.102,000 --> 0:03:15,000
by placing my heels on his feet

72
0:03:15.411,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and just walking.

73
0:03:17.364,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Another tactic that he used

74
0:03:19.067,000 --> 0:03:21,000
is he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me

75
0:03:21.99,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and have me chase it.

76
0:03:23.711,000 --> 0:03:25,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:26.059,000 --> 0:03:28,000
My inner stripper was very strong.

78
0:03:28.821,000 --> 0:03:29,000
(Laughter)

79
0:03:30.434,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Yeah.

80
0:03:31.987,000 --> 0:03:32,000
No, by the first day of kindergarten,

81
0:03:33.804,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I was walking like a champ

82
0:03:35.106,000 --> 0:03:37,000
who had been punched one too many times.

83
0:03:37.487,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Laughter)

84
0:03:38.9,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my town,

85
0:03:42.42,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and they were all my family.

86
0:03:43.796,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

87
0:03:44.844,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Now there are 20 Arabs in town,

88
0:03:46.951,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and they are still all my family.

89
0:03:48.793,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Laughter)

90
0:03:49.85,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I don't think anyone even noticed we weren't Italian.

91
0:03:52.579,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

92
0:03:56.574,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Applause)

93
0:04:00.311,000 --> 0:04:01,000
This was before 9/11

94
0:04:02.026,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and before politicians thought it was appropriate

95
0:04:05.042,000 --> 0:04:08,000
to use "I hate Muslims" as a campaign slogan.

96
0:04:09.096,000 --> 0:04:12,000
The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith.

97
0:04:12.311,000 --> 0:04:14,000
They did, however, seem very concerned

98
0:04:14.755,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that I would starve to death during Ramadan.

99
0:04:17.435,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I would explain to them that I have enough fat

100
0:04:19.61,000 --> 0:04:2,000
to live off of for three whole months,

101
0:04:21.626,000 --> 0:04:24,000
so fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake.

102
0:04:24.996,000 --> 0:04:25,000
(Laughter)

103
0:04:26.486,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I have tap-danced on Broadway.

104
0:04:29.382,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Yeah, on Broadway. It's crazy.

105
0:04:31.59,000 --> 0:04:32,000
(Applause)

106
0:04:32.693,000 --> 0:04:34,000
My parents couldn't afford physical therapy,

107
0:04:34.835,000 --> 0:04:36,000
so they sent me to dancing school.

108
0:04:37.402,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I learned how to dance in heels,

109
0:04:39.072,000 --> 0:04:4,000
which means I can walk in heels.

110
0:04:41.014,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And I'm from Jersey,

111
0:04:42.175,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and we are really concerned with being chic,

112
0:04:45.212,000 --> 0:04:48,000
so if my friends wore heels, so did I.

113
0:04:48.511,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And when my friends went and spent their summer vacations

114
0:04:51.529,000 --> 0:04:53,000
on the Jersey Shore, I did not.

115
0:04:54.341,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I spent my summers in a war zone,

116
0:04:56.579,000 --> 0:04:58,000
because my parents were afraid

117
0:04:58.65,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that if we didn't go back to Palestine every single summer,

118
0:05:02.548,000 --> 0:05:04,000
we'd grow up to be Madonna.

119
0:05:04.583,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:09.984,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me,

121
0:05:15.073,000 --> 0:05:16,000
so I drank deer's milk,

122
0:05:16.87,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I had hot cups on my back,

123
0:05:18.912,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I was dunked in the Dead Sea,

124
0:05:20.897,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and I remember the water burning my eyes

125
0:05:23.506,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and thinking, "It's working! It's working!"

126
0:05:25.995,000 --> 0:05:28,000
(Laughter)

127
0:05:29.296,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But one miracle cure we did find was yoga.

128
0:05:32.716,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I have to tell you, it's very boring,

129
0:05:35.995,000 --> 0:05:36,000
but before I did yoga,

130
0:05:37.474,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I was a stand-up comedian who can't stand up.

131
0:05:40.661,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And now I can stand on my head.

132
0:05:43.737,000 --> 0:05:47,000
My parents reinforced this notion

133
0:05:48.502,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that I could do anything,

134
0:05:51.215,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that no dream was impossible,

135
0:05:53.23,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and my dream was to be

136
0:05:54.809,000 --> 0:05:57,000
on the daytime soap opera "General Hospital."

137
0:05:57.842,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Laughter)

138
0:05:59.048,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I went to college during affirmative action

139
0:06:01.499,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and got a sweet scholarship to ASU,

140
0:06:03.529,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Arizona State University,

141
0:06:05.674,000 --> 0:06:07,000
because I fit every single quota.

142
0:06:08.166,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Laughter)

143
0:06:09.213,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I was like the pet lemur of the theater department.

144
0:06:13.406,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Everybody loved me.

145
0:06:14.953,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I did all the less-than-intelligent kids' homework,

146
0:06:18.066,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I got A's in all of my classes,

147
0:06:19.686,000 --> 0:06:2,000
A's in all of their classes.

148
0:06:21.587,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Laughter)

149
0:06:23.138,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Every time I did a scene from "The Glass Menagerie,"

150
0:06:26.271,000 --> 0:06:28,000
my professors would weep.

151
0:06:28.689,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But I never got cast.

152
0:06:31.333,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Finally, my senior year,

153
0:06:32.952,000 --> 0:06:35,000
ASU decided to do a show called "They Dance Real Slow in Jackson."

154
0:06:36.886,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It's a play about a girl with CP.

155
0:06:39.68,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I was a girl with CP.

156
0:06:41.745,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So I start shouting from the rooftops,

157
0:06:44.628,000 --> 0:06:45,000
"I'm finally going to get a part!

158
0:06:46.555,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I have cerebral palsy!

159
0:06:48.388,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Free at last! Free at last!

160
0:06:50.565,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Thank God almighty, I'm free at last!"

161
0:06:53.626,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I didn't get the part.

162
0:06:54.984,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Laughter)

163
0:06:57.443,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Sherry Brown got the part.

164
0:07:00.022,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I went racing to the head of the theater department

165
0:07:02.575,000 --> 0:07:04,000
crying hysterically, like someone shot my cat,

166
0:07:05.044,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to ask her why,

167
0:07:06.169,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and she said it was because they didn't think I could do the stunts.

168
0:07:10.762,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the stunts,

169
0:07:13.483,000 --> 0:07:14,000
neither can the character."

170
0:07:15.064,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

171
0:07:19.232,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Applause)

172
0:07:22.976,000 --> 0:07:27,000
This was a part that I was literally born to play

173
0:07:28.004,000 --> 0:07:32,000
they gave it to a non-palsy actress.

174
0:07:33.045,000 --> 0:07:34,000
College was imitating life.

175
0:07:35.276,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Hollywood has a sordid history

176
0:07:37.402,000 --> 0:07:4,000
of casting able-bodied actors to play disabled onscreen.

177
0:07:42.03,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Upon graduating, I moved back home,

178
0:07:44.823,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and my first acting gig was as an extra on a daytime soap opera.

179
0:07:49.32,000 --> 0:07:5,000
My dream was coming true.

180
0:07:51.14,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And I knew that I would be promoted

181
0:07:53.53,000 --> 0:07:56,000
from "Diner Diner" to "Wacky Best Friend" in no time.

182
0:07:57.053,000 --> 0:07:58,000
(Laughter)

183
0:07:58.335,000 --> 0:08:,000
But instead, I remained a glorified piece of furniture

184
0:08:00.986,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that you could only recognize from the back of my head,

185
0:08:03.589,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and it became clear to me

186
0:08:05.188,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that casting directors

187
0:08:07.107,000 --> 0:08:1,000
didn't hire fluffy, ethnic, disabled actors.

188
0:08:11.089,000 --> 0:08:13,000
They only hired perfect people.

189
0:08:13.462,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But there were exceptions to the rule.

190
0:08:15.81,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg,

191
0:08:17.983,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Roseanne Barr, Ellen,

192
0:08:19.919,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and all of these women had one thing in common:

193
0:08:22.454,000 --> 0:08:23,000
they were comedians.

194
0:08:23.716,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So I became a comic.

195
0:08:25.566,000 --> 0:08:28,000
(Laughter)

196
0:08:28.845,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Applause)

197
0:08:31.858,000 --> 0:08:34,000
My first gig was driving famous comics

198
0:08:35.535,000 --> 0:08:37,000
from New York City to shows in New Jersey,

199
0:08:38.114,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and I'll never forget the face of the first comic I ever drove

200
0:08:41.599,000 --> 0:08:44,000
when he realized that he was speeding down the New Jersey Turnpike

201
0:08:45.563,000 --> 0:08:47,000
with a chick with CP driving him.

202
0:08:47.76,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Laughter)

203
0:08:48.785,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I've performed in clubs all over America,

204
0:08:51.354,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and I've also performed in Arabic in the Middle East,

205
0:08:54.906,000 --> 0:08:56,000
uncensored and uncovered.

206
0:08:57.477,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Laughter)

207
0:08:58.549,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Some people say I'm the first stand-up comic in the Arab world.

208
0:09:02.29,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I never like to claim first,

209
0:09:04.471,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but I do know that they never heard

210
0:09:06.787,000 --> 0:09:09,000
that nasty little rumor that women aren't funny,

211
0:09:10.677,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and they find us hysterical.

212
0:09:12.488,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Laughter)

213
0:09:15.55,000 --> 0:09:19,000
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father

214
0:09:19.594,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Dean Obeidallah and I started

215
0:09:21.752,000 --> 0:09:23,000
the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival,

216
0:09:24.12,000 --> 0:09:25,000
now in its 10th year.

217
0:09:26.094,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Our goal was to change the negative image of Arab-Americans in media,

218
0:09:31.563,000 --> 0:09:33,000
while also reminding casting directors

219
0:09:34.365,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that South Asian and Arab are not synonymous.

220
0:09:37.13,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Laughter)

221
0:09:40.159,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Mainstreaming Arabs was much, much easier

222
0:09:46.079,000 --> 0:09:5,000
than conquering the challenge against the stigma against disability.

223
0:09:50.849,000 --> 0:09:52,000
My big break came in 2010.

224
0:09:53.196,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I was invited to be a guest on the cable news show

225
0:09:56.11,000 --> 0:09:58,000
"Countdown with Keith Olbermann."

226
0:09:58.442,000 --> 0:10:,000
I walked in looking like I was going to the prom,

227
0:10:01.444,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and they shuffle me into a studio

228
0:10:03.578,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and seat me on a spinning, rolling chair.

229
0:10:07.614,000 --> 0:10:08,000
(Laughter)

230
0:10:09.158,000 --> 0:10:1,000
So I looked at the stage manager

231
0:10:11.008,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and I'm like, "Excuse me, can I have another chair?"

232
0:10:14.336,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And she looked at me and she went,

233
0:10:16.062,000 --> 0:10:18,000
"Five, four, three, two ..."

234
0:10:18.807,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And we were live, right?

235
0:10:20.601,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So I had to grip onto the anchor's desk

236
0:10:22.969,000 --> 0:10:25,000
so that I wouldn't roll off the screen during the segment,

237
0:10:26.758,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and when the interview was over, I was livid.

238
0:10:29.617,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I had finally gotten my chance and I blew it,

239
0:10:31.783,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and I knew I would never get invited back.

240
0:10:34.988,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But not only did Mr. Olbermann invite me back,

241
0:10:37.996,000 --> 0:10:39,000
he made me a full-time contributor,

242
0:10:40.322,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and he taped down my chair.

243
0:10:43.047,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Laughter)

244
0:10:45.738,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Applause)

245
0:10:49.003,000 --> 0:10:52,000
One fun fact I learned while on the air with Keith Olbermann

246
0:10:52.72,000 --> 0:10:55,000
was that humans on the Internet are scumbags.

247
0:10:56.733,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Laughter)

248
0:10:57.758,000 --> 0:10:58,000
People say children are cruel,

249
0:10:59.346,000 --> 0:11:01,000
but I was never made fun of as a child or an adult.

250
0:11:02.29,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Suddenly, my disability on the world wide web is fair game.

251
0:11:05.985,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I would look at clips online and see comments like,

252
0:11:09.606,000 --> 0:11:11,000
"Yo, why's she tweakin'?"

253
0:11:12.266,000 --> 0:11:14,000
"Yo, is she retarded?"

254
0:11:14.568,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And my favorite, "Poor Gumby-mouth terrorist.

255
0:11:17.782,000 --> 0:11:18,000
What does she suffer from?

256
0:11:19.604,000 --> 0:11:2,000
We should really pray for her."

257
0:11:23.07,000 --> 0:11:27,000
One commenter even suggested that I add my disability to my credits:

258
0:11:27.684,000 --> 0:11:29,000
screenwriter, comedian, palsy.

259
0:11:33.247,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Disability is as visual as race.

260
0:11:36.12,000 --> 0:11:38,000
If a wheelchair user can't play Beyoncé,

261
0:11:38.504,000 --> 0:11:4,000
then Beyoncé can't play a wheelchair user.

262
0:11:41.702,000 --> 0:11:43,000
The disabled are the largest —

263
0:11:43.789,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Yeah, clap for that, man. Come on.

264
0:11:46.592,000 --> 0:11:5,000
(Applause)

265
0:11:51.544,000 --> 0:11:54,000
People with disabilities are the largest minority in the world,

266
0:11:54.591,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment.

267
0:11:59.17,000 --> 0:12:01,000
The doctors said that I wouldn't walk,

268
0:12:01.35,000 --> 0:12:02,000
but I am here in front of you.

269
0:12:04.039,000 --> 0:12:06,000
However, if I grew up with social media,

270
0:12:06.278,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I don't think I would be.

271
0:12:08.099,000 --> 0:12:09,000
I hope that together,

272
0:12:09.578,000 --> 0:12:11,000
we can create more positive images

273
0:12:12.153,000 --> 0:12:15,000
of disability in the media and in everyday life.

274
0:12:15.882,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Perhaps if there were more positive images,

275
0:12:18.363,000 --> 0:12:2,000
it would foster less hate on the Internet.

276
0:12:22.085,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Or maybe not.

277
0:12:23.285,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well.

278
0:12:28.46,000 --> 0:12:32,000
My crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places.

279
0:12:32.493,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I got to walk the red carpet

280
0:12:35.467,000 --> 0:12:37,000
flanked by soap diva Susan Lucci

281
0:12:38.246,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and the iconic Loreen Arbus.

282
0:12:40.311,000 --> 0:12:42,000
I got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler

283
0:12:42.972,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and work with my idol, the amazing Dave Matthews.

284
0:12:46.983,000 --> 0:12:49,000
I toured the world as a headliner on Arabs Gone Wild.

285
0:12:50.533,000 --> 0:12:55,000
I was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey

286
0:12:56.227,000 --> 0:12:58,000
at the 2008 DNC.

287
0:12:58.487,000 --> 0:13:,000
And I founded Maysoon's Kids,

288
0:13:00.989,000 --> 0:13:04,000
a charity that hopes to give Palestinian refugee children

289
0:13:05.048,000 --> 0:13:07,000
a sliver of the chance my parents gave me.

290
0:13:07.972,000 --> 0:13:09,000
But the one moment that stands out the most

291
0:13:10.431,000 --> 0:13:12,000
was when I got -- before this moment --

292
0:13:12.956,000 --> 0:13:15,000
(Laughter)

293
0:13:16.634,000 --> 0:13:19,000
(Applause)

294
0:13:20.43,000 --> 0:13:23,000
But the one moment that stands out the most

295
0:13:23.882,000 --> 0:13:25,000
was when I got to perform

296
0:13:26.008,000 --> 0:13:28,000
for the man who floats like a butterfly

297
0:13:28.234,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and stings like a bee,

298
0:13:29.786,000 --> 0:13:32,000
has Parkinson's and shakes just like me,

299
0:13:33.099,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Muhammad Ali.

300
0:13:35.356,000 --> 0:13:38,000
(Applause)

301
0:13:41.957,000 --> 0:13:42,000
(Applause ends)

302
0:13:43.6,000 --> 0:13:47,000
It was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live,

303
0:13:48.203,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and I dedicate this talk to his memory.

304
0:13:51.386,000 --> 0:13:53,000
(Arabic) Allah yerhamak yaba.

305
0:13:53.782,000 --> 0:13:55,000
(English) My name is Maysoon Zayid,

306
0:13:56.226,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and if I can can, you can can.

307
0:13:59.437,000 --> 0:14:,000
(Cheering)

308
0:14:01.306,000 --> 0:14:05,000
(Applause)

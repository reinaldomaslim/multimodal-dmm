0:03:00.697,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Water

49
0:03:07.659,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Boy

50
0:03:10.343,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Guitar strum)

51
0:03:11.398,000 --> 0:03:15,000
where are you hidin'?

52
0:03:15.743,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Guitar strum)

53
0:03:16.774,000 --> 0:03:17,000
If you don't come right here,

54
0:03:18.34,000 --> 0:03:19,000
if you don't come right here,

55
0:03:19.798,000 --> 0:03:2,000
if you don't come right here,

56
0:03:21.229,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I'm gonna tell

57
0:03:27.935,000 --> 0:03:3,000

on you.

59

(Guitar strum)

60
0:03:36.232,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Applause)

61
0:03:46.136,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Thank you.

62
0:03:50.292,000 --> 0:03:53,000
That was a song based on numerous work songs,

63
0:03:53.403,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and it was arranged by Odetta,

64
0:03:55.466,000 --> 0:03:56,000
a hero of mine.

65
0:03:57.142,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And this next song, well,

66
0:03:59.841,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I do a lot of historical music,

67
0:04:02.045,000 --> 0:04:04,000
starting with the Carolina Chocolate Drops

68
0:04:04.091,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and continuing on in my solo endeavors.

69
0:04:06.341,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And I believe that knowing your history as a musician

70
0:04:10.024,000 --> 0:04:11,000
is super important --

71
0:04:11.248,000 --> 0:04:12,000
it's important as a person,

72
0:04:12.877,000 --> 0:04:13,000
it's important as a country,

73
0:04:14.409,000 --> 0:04:15,000
it's important as a people.

74
0:04:15.823,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So I read a lot about where the music comes from

75
0:04:18.918,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and where this country comes from.

76
0:04:20.563,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I've been reading a lot about the Civil War

77
0:04:22.711,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and about slavery.

78
0:04:23.919,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And it's really tough.

79
0:04:25.57,000 --> 0:04:26,000
You know?

80
0:04:26.748,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It's really tough reading.

81
0:04:28.024,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And so as an artist, what I do with all that emotion,

82
0:04:30.568,000 --> 0:04:31,000
reading these people's stories,

83
0:04:32.182,000 --> 0:04:33,000
not just, "Oh, slavery was terrible."

84
0:04:34.015,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Yes, it was.

85
0:04:35.345,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But it's reading individual narratives of how it was for these people.

86
0:04:40.297,000 --> 0:04:41,000
You know?

87
0:04:41.48,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Then it's like, "Yeah, that could've been me."

88
0:04:43.836,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And it is people now. You know?

89
0:04:45.554,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So what you do with all that emotion

90
0:04:47.317,000 --> 0:04:48,000
is you've got to do something with it.

91
0:04:49.174,000 --> 0:04:5,000
As an artist, I write.

92
0:04:50.351,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So I wrote a song based on some of those narratives that I read,

93
0:04:53.494,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and it's called, "Come Love Come."

94
0:04:55.585,000 --> 0:04:57,000
We're going to do it for you now.

95
0:05:00.897,000 --> 0:05:04,000
(Claps)

96
0:05:06.913,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Sings) Come love come,

97
0:05:08.728,000 --> 0:05:09,000
the road lies low,

98
0:05:10.312,000 --> 0:05:13,000
the way is long and hard, I know.

99
0:05:13.58,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Come love come,

100
0:05:15.114,000 --> 0:05:16,000
the road lies free,

101
0:05:17.028,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

102
0:05:20.541,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Music)

103
0:05:33.403,000 --> 0:05:34,000
(Sings) When I was four,

104
0:05:35.029,000 --> 0:05:39,000
my loving mam was cornered by the boss's man.

105
0:05:39.903,000 --> 0:05:42,000
She turned her head and got struck down,

106
0:05:43.221,000 --> 0:05:46,000
they buried her in the cold, cold ground.

107
0:05:46.527,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Come love come,

108
0:05:48.131,000 --> 0:05:49,000
the road lies low,

109
0:05:49.917,000 --> 0:05:52,000
the way is long and hard, I know.

110
0:05:53.098,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Come love come,

111
0:05:54.88,000 --> 0:05:55,000
the road lies free,

112
0:05:56.492,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

113
0:05:59.413,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Music)

114
0:06:06.287,000 --> 0:06:07,000
When I was 12,

115
0:06:07.687,000 --> 0:06:08,000
my father dear

116
0:06:09.42,000 --> 0:06:12,000
was strong of arm and free of fear

117
0:06:12.84,000 --> 0:06:15,000
until the day he raised his hand,

118
0:06:15.989,000 --> 0:06:18,000
then he was sold to Alabama.

119
0:06:19.211,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Come love come,

120
0:06:21.091,000 --> 0:06:22,000
the road lies low,

121
0:06:22.93,000 --> 0:06:25,000
the way is long and hard, I know.

122
0:06:26.074,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Come love come,

123
0:06:27.639,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the road lies free,

124
0:06:29.422,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

125
0:06:32.564,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Music)

126
0:06:45.499,000 --> 0:06:48,000
When I was 16, found my bloom

127
0:06:48.79,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and found my man,

128
0:06:50.272,000 --> 0:06:51,000
we jumped the broom.

129
0:06:51.842,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We pledged each other the rest of our lives

130
0:06:54.92,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and on Saturday nights we were man and wife.

131
0:06:58.357,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Come love come,

132
0:07:00.037,000 --> 0:07:01,000
the road lies low,

133
0:07:01.699,000 --> 0:07:03,000
the way is long and hard, I know.

134
0:07:04.884,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Come love come,

135
0:07:06.525,000 --> 0:07:07,000
the road lies free,

136
0:07:08.141,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

137
0:07:11.479,000 --> 0:07:13,000
(Music)

138
0:07:24.088,000 --> 0:07:25,000
When I was 18,

139
0:07:25.759,000 --> 0:07:26,000
bugles called

140
0:07:27.356,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and boys in blue came o'er the wall.

141
0:07:30.514,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I took my chance and followed free,

142
0:07:33.726,000 --> 0:07:35,000
they led the way to Tennessee.

143
0:07:37.078,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Come love come,

144
0:07:38.794,000 --> 0:07:39,000
the road lies low,

145
0:07:40.47,000 --> 0:07:42,000
the way is long and hard, I know.

146
0:07:43.623,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Come love come,

147
0:07:45.314,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the road lies free,

148
0:07:46.961,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

149
0:07:50.969,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Music)

150
0:08:02.689,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Now here I sit in a tiny shack

151
0:08:05.763,000 --> 0:08:08,000
with 13 others at my back.

152
0:08:08.926,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I've sent you word,

153
0:08:10.521,000 --> 0:08:11,000
so all I can do

154
0:08:12.139,000 --> 0:08:15,000
is wait and wait and wait and wait

155
0:08:15.288,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and wait

156
0:08:20.736,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and wait for you.

157
0:08:24.761,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Come love come,

158
0:08:26.55,000 --> 0:08:27,000
the road lies low,

159
0:08:28.18,000 --> 0:08:3,000
the way is long and hard, I know.

160
0:08:31.268,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Come love come,

161
0:08:32.86,000 --> 0:08:33,000
the road lies free,

162
0:08:34.576,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

163
0:08:37.703,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Come love come,

164
0:08:39.381,000 --> 0:08:4,000
the road lies low,

165
0:08:40.957,000 --> 0:08:43,000
the way is long and hard, I know.

166
0:08:44.18,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Come love come,

167
0:08:45.784,000 --> 0:08:46,000
the road lies free,

168
0:08:47.428,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

169
0:08:58.235,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Oh,

170
0:09:03.558,000 --> 0:09:08,000
oh,

171
0:09:09.514,000 --> 0:09:11,000
oh.

172
0:09:12.396,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Whoa ... oh I'll wait for you.

173
0:09:19.311,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I'll wait for you.

174
0:09:22.416,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I'll wait for you

175
0:09:27.225,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I'll wait for you.

176
0:09:29.951,000 --> 0:09:32,000
(Applause)

177
0:09:43.465,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Thank you.

178
0:09:45.001,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So, with the dark you have to have the light.

179
0:09:49.208,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And in the African-American community,

180
0:09:51.132,000 --> 0:09:53,000
it's been the work of many hundreds of years

181
0:09:53.377,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to find a way to lift ourselves up.

182
0:09:55.487,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So I'm going to end with a couple of tunes from Sister Rosetta Tharpe,

183
0:09:59.774,000 --> 0:10:02,000
one of the more influential American music figures

184
0:10:02.809,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that most of you probably never heard of.

185
0:10:04.859,000 --> 0:10:06,000
If you have, I'm so happy.

186
0:10:06.999,000 --> 0:10:08,000
She's one of the innovators of rock 'n' roll guitar,

187
0:10:09.487,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and one of the first crossover artists from gospel to secular.

188
0:10:13.14,000 --> 0:10:14,000
She's an incredibly important figure,

189
0:10:14.938,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and I'm going to talk about her whenever I can.

190
0:10:17.155,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So these are a couple of her tunes.

191
0:10:18.846,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And don't worry -- you're going to get your chance to sing.

192
0:10:21.879,000 --> 0:10:23,000
(Music)

193
0:10:31.481,000 --> 0:10:33,000

198

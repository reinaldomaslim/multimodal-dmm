1
0:00:20.236,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I am honored to be here,

2
0:00:21.648,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and I'm honored to talk about this topic,

3
0:00:23.649,000 --> 0:00:24,000
which I think is of grave importance.

4
0:00:25.498,000 --> 0:00:26,000
We've been talking a lot

5
0:00:26.745,000 --> 0:00:31,000
about the horrific impacts of plastic on the planet and on other species,

6
0:00:32.712,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but plastic hurts people, too --

7
0:00:35.211,000 --> 0:00:36,000
especially poor people.

8
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And both in the production of plastic,

9
0:00:40.442,000 --> 0:00:42,000
the use of plastic and the disposal of plastic,

10
0:00:43.184,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the people who have the bull's-eye on their foreheads

11
0:00:45.773,000 --> 0:00:46,000
are poor people.

12
0:00:47.487,000 --> 0:00:5,000
People got very upset

13
0:00:50.588,000 --> 0:00:53,000
when the BP oil spill happened,

14
0:00:53.691,000 --> 0:00:54,000
for very good reason.

15
0:00:55.175,000 --> 0:00:56,000
People thought, "Oh, my God.

16
0:00:56.823,000 --> 0:00:58,000
This is terrible, this oil -- it's in the water.

17
0:00:59.623,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It's going to destroy the living systems there.

18
0:01:03.565,000 --> 0:01:04,000
People are going to be hurt.

19
0:01:05.023,000 --> 0:01:06,000
This is a terrible thing,

20
0:01:06.538,000 --> 0:01:08,000
this oil is going to hurt the people in the Gulf."

21
0:01:08.897,000 --> 0:01:1,000
What people don't think about is:

22
0:01:10.991,000 --> 0:01:12,000
What if the oil had made it safely to shore?

23
0:01:13.744,000 --> 0:01:15,000
What if the oil actually got where it was trying to go?

24
0:01:17.074,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Not only would it have been burned in engines and added to global warming,

25
0:01:21.095,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but there's a place called "Cancer Alley,"

26
0:01:24.48,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and the reason it's called "Cancer Alley"

27
0:01:26.639,000 --> 0:01:28,000
is because the petrochemical industry

28
0:01:29.291,000 --> 0:01:31,000
takes that oil and turns it into plastic

29
0:01:31.471,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and in the process, kills people.

30
0:01:34.174,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It shortens the lives of the people who live there in the Gulf.

31
0:01:37.246,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem when there's a spill;

32
0:01:41.064,000 --> 0:01:42,000
they're a problem when there's not.

33
0:01:42.798,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And what we don't often appreciate

34
0:01:45.229,000 --> 0:01:46,000
is the price that poor people pay

35
0:01:46.927,000 --> 0:01:48,000
for us to have these disposable products.

36
0:01:49.453,000 --> 0:01:51,000
The other thing we often don't appreciate is,

37
0:01:51.622,000 --> 0:01:54,000
it's not just at the point of production that poor people suffer.

38
0:01:54.746,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Poor people also suffer at the point of use.

39
0:01:57.396,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Those of us who earn a certain income level,

40
0:01:59.505,000 --> 0:02:,000
we have something called choice.

41
0:02:01.931,000 --> 0:02:03,000
The reason why you want to work hard and have a job

42
0:02:04.42,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and not be poor and broke

43
0:02:06.115,000 --> 0:02:08,000
is so you can have choices, economic choices.

44
0:02:08.952,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We actually get a chance to choose not to use products

45
0:02:13.061,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that have dangerous, poisonous plastic in them.

46
0:02:15.302,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Other people who are poor don't have those choices.

47
0:02:17.861,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So low-income people often are the ones

48
0:02:19.859,000 --> 0:02:22,000
who are buying the products that have those dangerous chemicals in them

49
0:02:23.867,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that their children are using.

50
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Those are the people who wind up ingesting a disproportionate amount

51
0:02:29.178,000 --> 0:02:31,000
of this poisonous plastic in using it.

52
0:02:31.369,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And people say, "Well, they should just buy a different product."

53
0:02:34.626,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Well, the problem with being poor is you don't have those choices.

54
0:02:37.785,000 --> 0:02:39,000
You often have to buy the cheapest products.

55
0:02:39.897,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The cheapest products are often the most dangerous.

56
0:02:42.9,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And if that weren't bad enough --

57
0:02:44.52,000 --> 0:02:47,000
if it wasn't just the production of plastic that's giving people cancer

58
0:02:47.965,000 --> 0:02:48,000
in places like Cancer Alley,

59
0:02:49.493,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and shortening lives and hurting poor kids at the point of use --

60
0:02:53.025,000 --> 0:02:55,000
at the point of disposal,

61
0:02:55.132,000 --> 0:02:58,000
once again, it's poor people who bear the burden.

62
0:02:58.762,000 --> 0:03:,000
Often, we think we're doing a good thing:

63
0:03:01.391,000 --> 0:03:04,000
You're in your office, drinking your bottled water or whatever it is,

64
0:03:05.063,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and you think to yourself, "I'm going to throw this away.

65
0:03:07.846,000 --> 0:03:1,000
No -- I'm going to be virtuous. I'm going to put it in the blue bin."

66
0:03:11.4,000 --> 0:03:13,000
You think, "I put mine in the blue bin."

67
0:03:13.456,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And then you look at your colleague and say,

68
0:03:17.044,000 --> 0:03:2,000
"Why, you cretin! You put yours in the white bin."

69
0:03:20.52,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And we use that as a moral tickle.

70
0:03:22.83,000 --> 0:03:23,000
We feel so good about ourselves.

71
0:03:24.599,000 --> 0:03:27,000
If we -- well, OK, I'm just ... me.

72
0:03:27.878,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Not you, but I feel this way often.

73
0:03:29.602,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And so we kind of have this moral feel-good moment.

75
0:03:34.58,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But if we were to be able to follow that little bottle

76
0:03:37.976,000 --> 0:03:38,000
on its journey,

77
0:03:39.465,000 --> 0:03:41,000
we would be shocked to discover that, all too often,

78
0:03:42.054,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that bottle is going to be put on a boat,

79
0:03:45.309,000 --> 0:03:47,000
it's going to go all the way across the ocean

80
0:03:48.146,000 --> 0:03:49,000
at some expense,

81
0:03:49.486,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and it's going to wind up in a developing country, often China.

82
0:03:53.029,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I think in our minds, we imagine

83
0:03:54.641,000 --> 0:03:56,000
somebody's going to take the little bottle and say,

84
0:03:57.125,000 --> 0:04:,000
"Oh, little bottle! We're so happy to see you, little bottle."

85
0:04:00.41,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
"You've served so well."

87
0:04:04.648,000 --> 0:04:05,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:05.695,000 --> 0:04:06,000
He's given a little bottle massage,

89
0:04:07.56,000 --> 0:04:08,000
a little bottle medal.

90
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And they say, "What would you like to do next?"

91
0:04:11.482,000 --> 0:04:13,000
The little bottle says, "I just don't know ..."

92
0:04:13.854,000 --> 0:04:14,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:15.204,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But that's not actually what happens.

94
0:04:18.35,000 --> 0:04:19,000
You know?

95
0:04:19.86,000 --> 0:04:22,000
That bottle winds up getting burned.

96
0:04:24.677,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The recycling of plastic in many developing countries

97
0:04:28.323,000 --> 0:04:31,000
means the incineration of the plastic, the burning of the plastic,

98
0:04:31.497,000 --> 0:04:33,000
which releases incredible toxic chemicals

99
0:04:33.947,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and, once again, kills people.

100
0:04:35.804,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And so, poor people who are making these products

101
0:04:39.548,000 --> 0:04:41,000
in petrochemical centers like Cancer Alley,

102
0:04:42.334,000 --> 0:04:45,000
poor people who are consuming these products disproportionately,

103
0:04:45.436,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and then poor people who, even at the tail end of the recycling,

104
0:04:48.974,000 --> 0:04:49,000
are having their lives shortened.

105
0:04:50.76,000 --> 0:04:53,000
They're all being harmed -- greatly --

106
0:04:54.38,000 --> 0:04:58,000
by this addiction that we have to disposability.

107
0:04:59.244,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Now, you think to yourself -- I know how you are --

108
0:05:01.75,000 --> 0:05:04,000
you say, "That sure is terrible for those poor people.

109
0:05:06.538,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It's just awful. Those poor people.

110
0:05:10.076,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I hope someone does something to help them."

111
0:05:12.862,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But what we don't understand is --

112
0:05:16.025,000 --> 0:05:17,000
here we are in Los Angeles.

113
0:05:17.85,000 --> 0:05:19,000
We worked very hard to get the smog reduction

114
0:05:20.005,000 --> 0:05:21,000
happening here in Los Angeles.

115
0:05:21.584,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But guess what?

116
0:05:22.839,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Because they're doing so much dirty production in Asia now,

117
0:05:26.218,000 --> 0:05:29,000
because the environmental laws don't protect the people in Asia now,

118
0:05:29.85,000 --> 0:05:33,000
almost all of the clean air gains and the toxic air gains

119
0:05:33.916,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that we've achieved here in California

120
0:05:35.812,000 --> 0:05:37,000
have been wiped out by dirty air coming over from Asia.

121
0:05:39.931,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So we all are being hit. We all are being impacted.

122
0:05:42.661,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It's just that the poor people get it first and worst.

123
0:05:45.439,000 --> 0:05:48,000
But the dirty production, the burning of toxins,

124
0:05:48.654,000 --> 0:05:5,000
the lack of environmental standards in Asia,

125
0:05:50.938,000 --> 0:05:52,000
is actually creating so much dirty air pollution,

126
0:05:53.455,000 --> 0:05:54,000
it's coming across the ocean,

127
0:05:54.896,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and has erased our gains here in California.

128
0:05:57.034,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We're back where we were in the 1970s.

129
0:05:58.952,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And so we're on one planet,

130
0:06:00.903,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and we have to be able to get to the root of these problems.

131
0:06:03.872,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The root of this problem, in my view,

132
0:06:06.954,000 --> 0:06:08,000
is the idea of disposability itself.

133
0:06:09.998,000 --> 0:06:12,000
You see, if you understand the link

134
0:06:13.043,000 --> 0:06:16,000
between what we're doing to poison and pollute the planet

135
0:06:16.795,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and what we're doing to poor people,

136
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
you arrive at a very troubling but also very helpful insight:

137
0:06:24.296,000 --> 0:06:26,000
In order to trash the planet,

138
0:06:26.568,000 --> 0:06:27,000
you have to trash people.

139
0:06:28.783,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But if you create a world where you don't trash people,

140
0:06:31.747,000 --> 0:06:32,000
you can't trash the planet.

141
0:06:33.56,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So now we are at a moment

142
0:06:36.05,000 --> 0:06:38,000
where the coming together of social justice as an idea

143
0:06:38.922,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and ecology as an idea,

144
0:06:41.371,000 --> 0:06:42,000
we finally can now see

145
0:06:42.68,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that they are really, at the end of the day, one idea.

146
0:06:45.269,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And it's the idea that we don't have disposable anything.

147
0:06:48.465,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We don't have disposable resources.

148
0:06:51.56,000 --> 0:06:53,000
We don't have disposable species.

149
0:06:54.215,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And we don't have disposable people, either.

150
0:06:56.795,000 --> 0:06:58,000
We don't have a throwaway planet,

151
0:06:58.841,000 --> 0:07:,000
and we don't have throwaway children -- it's all precious.

152
0:07:01.656,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding,

153
0:07:04.56,000 --> 0:07:06,000
new opportunities for action begin to emerge.

154
0:07:08.155,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Biomimicry,

155
0:07:09.85,000 --> 0:07:12,000
which is an emerging science,

156
0:07:13.391,000 --> 0:07:16,000
winds up being a very important social justice idea.

157
0:07:16.996,000 --> 0:07:18,000
People who are just learning about this stuff:

158
0:07:19.212,000 --> 0:07:22,000
biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species.

159
0:07:23.211,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Democracy, by the way,

160
0:07:24.399,000 --> 0:07:27,000
means respecting the wisdom of all people -- we'll get to that.

161
0:07:27.43,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species.

162
0:07:30.24,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It turns out we're a pretty clever species.

163
0:07:32.774,000 --> 0:07:35,000
We have this big cortex, we're pretty proud of ourselves.

164
0:07:35.877,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But if we want to make something hard,

165
0:07:38.464,000 --> 0:07:4,000
we say, "I know! I'm going to make a hard substance.

166
0:07:41.002,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I know! I'm going to get vacuums and furnaces

167
0:07:44.56,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and drag stuff out of the ground

168
0:07:46.268,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and get things hot and poison and pollute ...

169
0:07:49.181,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But I got this hard thing!"

170
0:07:52.064,000 --> 0:07:53,000
(Laughter)

171
0:07:53.238,000 --> 0:07:54,000
"I'm so clever!"

172
0:07:54.861,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And you look behind you, and there's destruction all around you.

173
0:07:57.93,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But guess what?

174
0:07:59.107,000 --> 0:08:01,000
You're so clever, but you're not as clever as a clam.

175
0:08:01.964,000 --> 0:08:02,000
A clamshell is hard.

176
0:08:03.718,000 --> 0:08:05,000
There's no vacuums. There's no big furnaces.

177
0:08:06.413,000 --> 0:08:07,000
There's no poison. There's no pollution.

178
0:08:08.377,000 --> 0:08:12,000
It turns out that other species figured out a long time ago

179
0:08:13.201,000 --> 0:08:15,000
how to create many of the things we need

180
0:08:15.56,000 --> 0:08:17,000
using biological processes that nature knows how to use well.

181
0:08:19.223,000 --> 0:08:22,000
That insight of biomimicry, of our scientists finally realizing

182
0:08:22.922,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that we have as much to learn from other species --

183
0:08:25.354,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I don't mean taking a mouse and sticking it with stuff.

184
0:08:28.56,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I don't mean looking at it from that way, abusing the little species.

185
0:08:31.893,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I mean actually respecting them, respecting what they've achieved.

186
0:08:35.173,000 --> 0:08:36,000
That's called biomimicry,

187
0:08:36.754,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and that opens the door to zero waste production;

188
0:08:40.651,000 --> 0:08:41,000
zero pollution production;

189
0:08:42.56,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that we could actually enjoy

190
0:08:44.56,000 --> 0:08:46,000
a high quality of life, a high standard of living,

191
0:08:47.205,000 --> 0:08:48,000
without trashing the planet.

192
0:08:48.8,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Well, that idea of biomimicry,

193
0:08:51.864,000 --> 0:08:52,000
respecting the wisdom of all species,

194
0:08:54.226,000 --> 0:08:57,000
combined with the idea of democracy and social justice,

195
0:08:58.122,000 --> 0:09:,000
respecting the wisdom and the worth of all people,

196
0:09:00.741,000 --> 0:09:01,000
would give us a different society.

197
0:09:02.56,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We would have a different economy.

198
0:09:04.456,000 --> 0:09:06,000
We would have a green society

199
0:09:06.79,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that Dr. King would be proud of.

200
0:09:09.219,000 --> 0:09:1,000
That should be the goal.

201
0:09:10.893,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And the way that we get there is to first of all recognize

202
0:09:13.885,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that the idea of disposability

203
0:09:16.826,000 --> 0:09:2,000
not only hurts the species we've talked about,

204
0:09:20.96,000 --> 0:09:22,000
but it even corrupts our own society.

205
0:09:23.735,000 --> 0:09:25,000
We're so proud to live here in California.

206
0:09:26.736,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We just had this vote, and everybody's like,

207
0:09:28.846,000 --> 0:09:29,000
"Well -- not in our state!"

208
0:09:30.608,000 --> 0:09:31,000
(Laughter)

209
0:09:32.153,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I don't know what those other states were doing, but ..."

210
0:09:34.96,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Laughter)

211
0:09:36.726,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Just so proud.

212
0:09:39.321,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And, yeah, I'm proud, too.

213
0:09:41.696,000 --> 0:09:42,000
But ...

214
0:09:44.42,000 --> 0:09:47,000
California, though we lead the world in some of the green stuff,

215
0:09:47.96,000 --> 0:09:48,000
we also, unfortunately, lead the world

216
0:09:49.96,000 --> 0:09:5,000
in some of the gulag stuff.

217
0:09:52.666,000 --> 0:09:55,000
California has one of the highest incarceration rates

218
0:09:56.23,000 --> 0:09:57,000
of all the 50 states.

219
0:09:57.96,000 --> 0:09:59,000
We have a moral challenge in this movement.

220
0:10:01.077,000 --> 0:10:06,000
We are passionate about rescuing some dead materials from the landfill,

221
0:10:06.121,000 --> 0:10:07,000
but sometimes not as passionate

222
0:10:07.961,000 --> 0:10:09,000
about rescuing living beings, living people.

223
0:10:10.674,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And I would say that we live in a country --

224
0:10:13.817,000 --> 0:10:14,000
five percent of the world's population,

225
0:10:15.818,000 --> 0:10:16,000
25 percent of the greenhouse gases,

226
0:10:18.332,000 --> 0:10:2,000
but also 25 percent of the world's prisoners.

227
0:10:21.344,000 --> 0:10:23,000
One of every four people locked up anywhere in the world

228
0:10:24.028,000 --> 0:10:26,000
is locked up right here in the United States.

229
0:10:26.226,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So that is consistent with this idea

230
0:10:28.96,000 --> 0:10:3,000
that disposability is something we believe in.

231
0:10:32.176,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And yet,

232
0:10:34.5,000 --> 0:10:38,000
as a movement that has to broaden its constituency,

233
0:10:39.046,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that has to grow,

234
0:10:40.381,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that has to reach out beyond our natural comfort zone,

235
0:10:43.507,000 --> 0:10:45,000
one of the challenges to the success of this movement,

236
0:10:46.444,000 --> 0:10:49,000
of getting rid of things like plastic and helping the economy shift,

237
0:10:49.708,000 --> 0:10:51,000
is people look at our movement with some suspicion.

238
0:10:53.124,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And they ask a question, and the question is:

239
0:10:55.744,000 --> 0:10:56,000
How can these people be so passionate?

240
0:10:58.506,000 --> 0:11:01,000
A poor person, a low-income person, somebody in Cancer Alley,

241
0:11:01.769,000 --> 0:11:03,000
somebody in Watts,

242
0:11:04.227,000 --> 0:11:06,000
somebody in Harlem, somebody on an Indian reservation,

243
0:11:06.96,000 --> 0:11:08,000
might say to themselves -- and rightfully so --

244
0:11:09.202,000 --> 0:11:11,000
"How can these people be so passionate

245
0:11:12.108,000 --> 0:11:13,000
about making sure

246
0:11:13.873,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that a plastic bottle has a second chance in life,

247
0:11:17.96,000 --> 0:11:19,000
or an aluminum can has a second chance,

248
0:11:21.171,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and yet, when my child gets in trouble and goes to prison,

249
0:11:24.761,000 --> 0:11:25,000
he doesn't get a second chance?"

250
0:11:26.594,000 --> 0:11:28,000
"How can this movement be so passionate about saying

251
0:11:29.1,000 --> 0:11:31,000
we don't have throwaway stuff, no throwaway dead materials,

252
0:11:31.944,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and yet accept throwaway lives

253
0:11:34.783,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and throwaway communities like Cancer Alley?"

254
0:11:37.124,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And so, we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement.

255
0:11:42.698,000 --> 0:11:43,000
When we take on topics like this,

256
0:11:44.409,000 --> 0:11:48,000
it gives us that extra call to reach out to other movements

257
0:11:49.065,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and to become more inclusive and to grow,

258
0:11:51.431,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and we can finally get out of this crazy dilemma that we've been in.

259
0:11:55.229,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Most of you are good, softhearted people.

260
0:11:58.649,000 --> 0:12:,000
When you were younger, you cared about the whole world,

261
0:12:01.329,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and at some point, somebody said you had to pick an issue,

262
0:12:05.098,000 --> 0:12:07,000
you had to boil your love down to an issue.

263
0:12:07.542,000 --> 0:12:08,000
"Can't love the whole world --

264
0:12:09.089,000 --> 0:12:12,000
you've got to work on trees or you've got to work on immigration.

265
0:12:12.707,000 --> 0:12:14,000
You've got to shrink it down and be about one issue."

266
0:12:15.635,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And really, they fundamentally told you,

267
0:12:18.579,000 --> 0:12:19,000
"Are you going to hug a tree?

268
0:12:20.713,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Or are you going to hug a child? Pick.

269
0:12:22.864,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Are you going to hug a tree?

270
0:12:24.5,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Or are you going to hug a child? Pick."

271
0:12:26.593,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Well, when you start working on issues like plastic,

272
0:12:29.069,000 --> 0:12:31,000
you realize the whole thing is connected.

273
0:12:31.292,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And luckily, most of us are blessed to have two arms --

274
0:12:34.096,000 --> 0:12:35,000
we can hug both.

275
0:12:35.511,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Thank you very much.

276
0:12:36.904,000 --> 0:12:42,000
(Applause)

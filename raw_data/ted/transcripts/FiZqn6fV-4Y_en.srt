1
0:00:12.96,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What is the intersection between technology, art and science?

2
0:00:18.769,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Curiosity and wonder,

3
0:00:20.899,000 --> 0:00:22,000
because it drives us to explore,

4
0:00:23.646,000 --> 0:00:25,000
because we're surrounded by things we can't see.

5
0:00:27.11,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And I love to use film to take us on a journey

6
0:00:30.06,000 --> 0:00:32,000
through portals of time and space,

7
0:00:32.94,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to make the invisible visible,

8
0:00:35.578,000 --> 0:00:36,000
because what that does,

9
0:00:36.964,000 --> 0:00:37,000
it expands our horizons,

10
0:00:38.887,000 --> 0:00:4,000
it transforms our perception,

11
0:00:41.571,000 --> 0:00:43,000
it opens our minds

12
0:00:43.678,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and it touches our heart.

13
0:00:45.944,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So here are some scenes from my 3D IMAX film,

14
0:00:48.767,000 --> 0:00:49,000
"Mysteries of the Unseen World."

15
0:00:51.353,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Music)

16
0:00:53.799,000 --> 0:00:57,000
There is movement which is too slow for our eyes to detect,

17
0:00:58.253,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and time lapse makes us discover

18
0:01:01.404,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and broaden our perspective of life.

19
0:01:03.79,000 --> 0:01:05,000
We can see how organisms emerge and grow,

20
0:01:08.042,000 --> 0:01:11,000
how a vine survives by creeping from the forest floor

21
0:01:11.701,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to look at the sunlight.

22
0:01:16.117,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And at the grand scale,

23
0:01:17.803,000 --> 0:01:2,000
time lapse allows us to see our planet in motion.

24
0:01:22.875,000 --> 0:01:24,000
We can view not only the vast sweep of nature,

25
0:01:25.724,000 --> 0:01:27,000
but the restless movement of humanity.

26
0:01:29.346,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Each streaking dot represents a passenger plane,

27
0:01:32.65,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and by turning air traffic data into time-lapse imagery,

28
0:01:36.215,000 --> 0:01:38,000
we can see something that's above us constantly

29
0:01:38.56,000 --> 0:01:39,000
but invisible:

30
0:01:40.301,000 --> 0:01:43,000
the vast network of air travel over the United States.

31
0:01:45.872,000 --> 0:01:47,000
We can do the same thing with ships at sea.

32
0:01:48.826,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We can turn data into a time-lapse view of a global economy in motion.

33
0:02:01.676,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And decades of data give us the view of our entire planet

34
0:02:05.364,000 --> 0:02:07,000
as a single organism

35
0:02:07.593,000 --> 0:02:1,000
sustained by currents circulating throughout the oceans

36
0:02:10.855,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and by clouds swirling through the atmosphere,

37
0:02:14.976,000 --> 0:02:15,000
pulsing with lightning,

38
0:02:16.849,000 --> 0:02:17,000
crowned by the aurora Borealis.

39
0:02:19.937,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It may be the ultimate time-lapse image:

40
0:02:24.171,000 --> 0:02:26,000
the anatomy of Earth brought to life.

41
0:02:31.599,000 --> 0:02:32,000
At the other extreme,

42
0:02:33.289,000 --> 0:02:36,000
there are things that move too fast for our eyes,

43
0:02:36.702,000 --> 0:02:39,000
but we have technology that can look into that world as well.

44
0:02:43.763,000 --> 0:02:44,000
With high-speed cameras,

45
0:02:44.93,000 --> 0:02:46,000
we can do the opposite of time lapse.

46
0:02:46.985,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We can shoot images

47
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that are thousands of times faster than our vision.

48
0:02:53.001,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And we can see how nature's ingenious devices work,

49
0:02:56.985,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and perhaps we can even imitate them.

50
0:03:02.648,000 --> 0:03:03,000
When a dragonfly flutters by,

51
0:03:04.665,000 --> 0:03:06,000
you may not realize,

52
0:03:06.724,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but it's the greatest flier in nature.

53
0:03:08.947,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It can hover, fly backwards,

54
0:03:13.391,000 --> 0:03:14,000
even upside down.

55
0:03:16.476,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And by tracking markers on an insect's wings,

56
0:03:19.577,000 --> 0:03:21,000
we can visualize the air flow that they produce.

57
0:03:23.326,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Nobody knew the secret,

58
0:03:24.691,000 --> 0:03:26,000
but high speed shows that a dragonfly

59
0:03:27.324,000 --> 0:03:29,000
can move all four wings in different directions

60
0:03:29.832,000 --> 0:03:3,000
at the same time.

61
0:03:31.68,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And what we learn can lead us to new kinds of robotic flyers

62
0:03:35.292,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that can expand our vision

63
0:03:37.11,000 --> 0:03:39,000
of important and remote places.

64
0:03:44.392,000 --> 0:03:45,000
We're giants,

65
0:03:45.687,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and we're unaware of things that are too small for us to see.

66
0:03:48.746,000 --> 0:03:52,000
The electron microscope fires electrons which creates images

67
0:03:53.369,000 --> 0:03:55,000
which can magnify things by as much as a million times.

68
0:03:57.416,000 --> 0:03:58,000
This is the egg of a butterfly.

69
0:04:01.455,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And there are unseen creatures living all over your body,

70
0:04:04.544,000 --> 0:04:06,000
including mites that spend their entire lives

71
0:04:07.259,000 --> 0:04:09,000
dwelling on your eyelashes,

72
0:04:09.29,000 --> 0:04:1,000
crawling over your skin at night.

73
0:04:12.722,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Can you guess what this is?

74
0:04:16.01,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Shark skin.

75
0:04:19.96,000 --> 0:04:2,000
A caterpillar's mouth.

76
0:04:24.409,000 --> 0:04:25,000
The eye of a fruit fly.

77
0:04:29.283,000 --> 0:04:3,000
An eggshell.

78
0:04:33.95,000 --> 0:04:34,000
A flea.

79
0:04:39.36,000 --> 0:04:4,000
A snail's tongue.

80
0:04:44.098,000 --> 0:04:46,000
We think we know most of the animal kingdom,

81
0:04:46.473,000 --> 0:04:48,000
but there may be millions of tiny species

82
0:04:48.992,000 --> 0:04:49,000
waiting to be discovered.

83
0:04:54.992,000 --> 0:04:56,000
A spider also has great secrets,

84
0:04:57.779,000 --> 0:05:,000
because spiders' silk thread is pound for pound stronger than steel

85
0:05:01.517,000 --> 0:05:02,000
but completely elastic.

86
0:05:03.744,000 --> 0:05:06,000
This journey will take us all the way down to the nano world.

87
0:05:07.987,000 --> 0:05:11,000
The silk is 100 times thinner than human hair.

88
0:05:14.293,000 --> 0:05:16,000
On there is bacteria,

89
0:05:17.02,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and near that bacteria, 10 times smaller,

90
0:05:20.221,000 --> 0:05:21,000
a virus.

91
0:05:23.291,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Inside of that, 10 times smaller,

92
0:05:26.647,000 --> 0:05:27,000
three strands of DNA.

93
0:05:29.743,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And nearing the limit of our most powerful microscopes,

94
0:05:33.076,000 --> 0:05:35,000
single carbon atoms.

95
0:05:37.787,000 --> 0:05:39,000
With the tip of a powerful microscope,

96
0:05:39.935,000 --> 0:05:41,000
we can actually move atoms

97
0:05:42.156,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and begin to create amazing nano devices.

98
0:05:47.827,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Some could one day patrol our body for all kinds of diseases

99
0:05:51.92,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and clean out clogged arteries along the way.

100
0:05:56.1,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Tiny chemical machines of the future

101
0:05:59.084,000 --> 0:06:01,000
can one day, perhaps, repair DNA.

102
0:06:03.084,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We are on the threshold of extraordinary advances,

103
0:06:06.151,000 --> 0:06:09,000
born of our drive to unveil the mysteries of life.

104
0:06:12.554,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So under an endless rain of cosmic dust,

105
0:06:15.482,000 --> 0:06:17,000
the air is full of pollen,

106
0:06:17.599,000 --> 0:06:18,000
micro-diamonds and jewels

107
0:06:19.259,000 --> 0:06:22,000
from other planets and supernova explosions.

108
0:06:23.573,000 --> 0:06:27,000
People go about their lives surrounded by the unseeable.

109
0:06:30.59,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Knowing that there's so much around us we can't see

110
0:06:33.662,000 --> 0:06:36,000
forever changes our understanding of the world,

111
0:06:36.816,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and by looking at unseen worlds,

112
0:06:38.656,000 --> 0:06:4,000
we recognize that we exist in the living universe,

113
0:06:41.432,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and this new perspective creates wonder

114
0:06:44.312,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and inspires us to become explorers

115
0:06:46.915,000 --> 0:06:47,000
in our own backyards.

116
0:06:50.602,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Who knows what awaits to be seen

117
0:06:53.036,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and what new wonders will transform our lives.

118
0:06:56.727,000 --> 0:06:57,000
We'll just have to see.

119
0:07:01.674,000 --> 0:07:05,000
(Applause)

120
0:07:06.451,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Thank you.

121
0:07:07.649,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Does anybody know when the stethoscope was invented?

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Any guesses? 1816.

3
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And what I can say is, in 2016,

4
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
doctors aren't going to be walking around with stethoscopes.

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
There's a whole lot better technology coming,

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and that's part of the change in medicine.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
What has changed our society

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
has been wireless devices.

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But the future are digital medical wireless devices, OK?

10
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So, let me give you some examples of this

11
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to kind of make this much more concrete.

12
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
This is the first one. This is an electrocardiogram.

13
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And, as a cardiologist, to think that you could see in real time

14
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
a patient, an individual, anywhere in the world

15
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
on your smartphone,

16
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
watching your rhythm -- that's incredible,

17
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and it's with us today.

18
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But that's just the beginning.

19
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
You check your email while you're sitting here.

20
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
In the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs,

21
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
all your vital signs: your heart rhythm,

22
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
your blood pressure, your oxygen, your temperature, etc.

23
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
This is already available today.

24
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
This is AirStrip Technologies.

25
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
It's now wired -- or I should say, wireless --

26
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
by taking the aggregate of these signals

27
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
in the hospital, in the intensive care unit,

28
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and putting it on a smartphone for physicians.

29
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
If you're an expectant parent,

30
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
what about the ability to monitor, continuously,

31
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
fetal heart rate, or intrauterine contractions,

32
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and not having to worry so much that things are

33
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
fine as the pregnancy,

34
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and moving over into the time of delivery?

35
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And then as we go further,

36
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
today we have continuous glucose sensors.

37
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Right now, they are under the skin,

38
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
but in the future, they won't have to be implanted.

39
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And of course, the desired range -- trying to keep glucose

40
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
between 75 and less than 200,

41
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
checking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor --

42
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
you'll see how that can impact diabetes.

43
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And what about sleep?

44
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
We're going to zoom in on that a little bit.

45
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We're supposed to spend a third of our life in sleep.

46
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
What if, on your phone,

47
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
which will be available in the next few weeks,

48
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
you had every minute of your sleep displayed?

49
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And this is, of course, as you can see, the awake is the orange.

50
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The REM sleep, rapid eye movement,

51
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
dream state, is in light green;

52
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and light is gray, light sleep;

53
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and deep sleep, the best restorative sleep,

54
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
is that dark green.

55
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
How about counting every calorie?

56
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And this is ability, in real time, to actually take

57
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
measurements of caloric intake

58
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
as well as expenditure, through a Band-Aid.

59
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Now, what I've talked about are physiologic metrics.

60
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But what I want to get to, the next frontier,

61
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
very quickly, and why the stethoscope

62
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
is on its way out,

63
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
is because we can transcend listening to the valve sounds,

64
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and the breath sounds, because now,

65
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
introduced by G.E. is a handheld ultra-sound.

66
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Why is this important? Because this is so much more sensitive.

67
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Here is an example of an abdominal ultrasound,

68
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and also a cardiac echo, which can be sent wireless,

69
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and then there's an example of fetal monitoring on your smartphone.

70
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So, we're not just talking about physiologic metrics --

71
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
the key measurements of vital signs,

72
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and all those things in physiology -- but also all the imaging

73
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that one could look at in your smartphone.

74
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now, this is an example of another obsolete technology,

75
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
soon to be buried: the Holter Monitor.

76
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Twenty-four hour recording, lots of wires.

77
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
This is now a little tiny patch.

78
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
You can put it on for two weeks

79
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and send it in the mail.

80
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Now, how does this work? Well,

81
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
there is these smart Band-Aids or these sensors

82
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that one would put on, on a shoe or on the wrist.

83
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And this sends a signal

84
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and it creates a body area network to a gateway.

85
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway,

86
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
as today many of these things are dedicated gateways,

87
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
because they are not so well integrated.

88
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
That signal goes to the web, the cloud,

89
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and then it can be processed and sent anywhere:

90
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to a caregiver, to a physician,

91
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
back to the patient, etc.

92
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So, that's basically very simplistic technology

93
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
of how this works.

94
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Now, I have this device on.

95
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I didn't want to take my shirt off to show you, but I can tell you it's on.

96
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
This is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm,

97
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
as you saw already,

98
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
but it also goes well beyond that.

99
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
This is me now. And you can see the ECG.

100
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Below that's the actual heart rate and the trend;

101
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to the right of that is a bioconductant.

102
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
That's the fluid status,

103
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
fluid status, that's really important

104
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
if you're monitoring somebody with heart failure.

105
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And below that's temperature,

106
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and respiration, and oxygen,

107
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and then the position activity.

108
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So, this is really striking, because this device

109
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
measures seven things

110
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that are very much vital signs

111
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
for monitoring someone with heart failure. OK?

112
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And why is this important? Well,

113
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
this is the most expensive bed.

114
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
What if we could reduce the need for hospital beds?

115
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Well, we can. First of all, heart failure

116
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
is the number one reason

117
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
for hospital admissions and readmissions in this country.

118
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
The cost of heart failure is 37 billion dollars a year,

119
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
which is 80 percent related to hospitalization.

120
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And in the course of 30 days after a hospital stay

121
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
for a Medicare greater than 65 years or older,

122
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
is -- 27 percent are readmitted in 30 days,

123
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and by six months, over 56 percent are readmitted.

124
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So, can we improve that? Well the idea is

125
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
we take this device that I'm wearing,

126
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and we put it on 600 patients with heart failure,

127
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
randomly assigned, versus 600 patients

128
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
who don't have active monitoring,

129
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
and see whether we can reduce heart failure readmissions,

130
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and that's exciting. And we'll start that trial,

131
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and you'll hear more about how we're going to do that,

132
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but that's a type of wireless device trial

133
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that could change medicine in the years ahead.

134
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Why now? Why has this all of a sudden become

135
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
a reality, an exciting direction in the future of medicine?

136
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
What we have is, in a way, a perfect positive storm.

137
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
This sets up consumer-driven healthcare.

138
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
That's where this is all starting.

139
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Let me just give you specifics about why this is

140
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
a big movement if you're not aware of it:

141
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
1.2 million Americans

142
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
have gotten a Nike shoe, which is a body-area network

143
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that connects the shoe, the sole of the shoe to the iPhone, or an iPod.

144
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And this Wired Magazine cover article

145
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
really captured a lot of this; it talked a lot about the Nike shoe

146
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and how quickly that's been adopted to monitor exercise physiology

147
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and energy expenditure.

148
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Here are some things, the principles

149
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that are guiding principles to keep in mind:

150
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
"A data-driven health revolution

151
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
promises to make us all

152
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
better, faster, and stronger. Living by numbers."

153
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And this one, which is really telling,

154
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
this was from July, this cover article:

155
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
"The personal metrics movement goes way beyond

156
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
diet and exercise. It's about tracking every facet

157
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
of life, from sleep to mood to pain,

158
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
24/7/365."

159
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Well, I tried this device.

160
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
A lot of you have gotten that Phillips Direct Life.

161
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I didn't have one of those,

162
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
but I got the Fitbit.

163
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
That looks like this.

164
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It's like a wireless accelerometer, pedometer.

165
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And I want to just give you the results of that testing,

166
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
because I wanted to understand about the consumer movement.

167
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I hope the, by the way, the Phillips Direct Life works better --

168
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I hope so.

169
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But this monitors food, it monitors activity and tracks weight.

170
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
However you have to put in most of this stuff.

171
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
The only thing it really tracks by itself is activity,

172
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and even then, it's not complete.

173
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So, you exercise and it picks up the exercise.

174
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
You put in your height and weight, it calculates BMI,

175
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
and of course it tells you how many calories you're expending

176
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
from the exercise, and how many you took in,

177
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
if you go in and enter all the foods.

178
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
But it really wants you to enter all your activity.

179
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And so I went to this,

180
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and of course I was gratified that it picked up

181
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
the 42 minutes of exercise, elliptical exercise I did,

182
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
but then it wants more information.

183
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So, it says, "You want to log sexual activity.

184
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
How long did you do it for?"

185
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
(Laughter)

186
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And it says, "How hard was it?"

187
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Laughter)

188
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Furthermore it says, "Start time."

189
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Now, this doesn't appear -- this just doesn't work,

190
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I mean, this just doesn't work.

191
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So, now I want to move to sleep.

192
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Who would ever have thought you could have your own EEG

193
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
at your home, tagged to a very nice alarm clock, by the way?

194
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
This is the headband that goes with this alarm clock.

195
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
It monitors your brainwaves continuously, when you're sleeping.

196
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So, I did this thing for seven days

197
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
getting ready for TEDMed.

198
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
This is an important part of our life, one-third you're supposed to be sleeping.

199
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
Of course how many here

200
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
have any problems with sleeping?

201
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
It's usually 90 percent. So, you tell me you sleep better than expected.

202
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Okay, well this was a week of

203
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
my life in sleeping,

204
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and you get a Z.Q. score. Instead of an I.Q. score,

205
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
you get a Z.Q. score when you wake up.

206
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
You say, "Oh, OK." And a Z.Q. score

207
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
is adjusted to age,

208
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and you want to get as high as you possibly can.

209
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So this is the moment-by-moment,

210
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
or minute-by-minute sleep.

211
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And you see that Z.Q. there was 80-odd.

212
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And the wake time is in orange.

213
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And this can be a problem, as I learned.

214
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Because it not only helps you with quantifying

215
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
your sleep,

216
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but also tells others you're awake.

217
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So, when my wife came in and she

218
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
could tell you're awake.

219
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
"Eric, I want to talk. I want to talk."

220
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And I'm trying to play possum.

221
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
This thing is very, very impressive.

222
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
OK. So, that's the first night.

223
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And this one is now 67,

224
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and that's not a good score.

225
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And this tells you, of course, how much you had in REM sleep,

226
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
in deep sleep, and all this sort of thing.

227
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
This was really fascinating because

228
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
this gave that quantitation

229
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
about all the different phases of sleep.

230
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So, it also then tells you how you do compared to your age group.

231
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
It's like a managed competition of sleep.

232
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And really interesting stuff.

233
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Look at this thing and say, "Well, I didn't think I was a very good sleeper,

234
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
but actually I did better than average in 50 to 60 year olds." OK?

235
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And the key thing was, what I didn't know,

236
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
was that I was a really good dreamer.

237
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
OK. Now let's move from sleep to diseases.

238
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Eighty percent of Americans have chronic disease,

239
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
or 80 percent of age greater than 65 have

240
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
two or more chronic disease,

241
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
140 million Americans

242
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
have one or more chronic disease,

243
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and 80 percent of our 1.5, whatever, trillion

244
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
expenditures are related to chronic disease.

245
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Now, diabetes is one of the big ones.

246
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Almost 24 million people have diabetes.

247
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And here is the latest map. It was published

248
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
just a little more than a week ago in the New York Times,

249
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and it isn't looking good.

250
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
That is, for men, 29 percent

251
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
in the country over 60 have Type II diabetes,

252
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and women, although it's less, it's terribly high.

253
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
But of course we have a way to measure that now

254
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
on a continuous basis,

255
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
with a sensor that detects blood glucose,

256
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and it's important because we could detect

257
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
hyperglycemia that otherwise wouldn't be known,

258
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and also hypoglycemia.

259
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And you can see the red dots, in this particular patient's case,

260
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
were finger sticks, which would have missed both ends.

261
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
But by continuous monitoring,

262
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
it captures all that vital information.

263
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
The future of this though,

264
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
is being able to move this to a Band-Aid type phenomenon,

265
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and that's not so far away.

266
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So, let me just give you, very quickly,

267
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
10 top targets for wireless medicine.

268
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
All these things are possible --

269
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
some of them are very close,

270
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
or already, as you heard,

271
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
are available today, in some way or form.

272
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Alzheimer's disease:

273
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
there's five million people affected, and you can check

274
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
vital signs, activity, balance.

275
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Asthma: large number, we could detect things like

276
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
pollen count, air quality, respiratory rate. Breast cancer,

277
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I'll show you an example of that real quickly.

278
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

279
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Depression, there's a great approach to that in mood disorders.

280
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Diabetes I've just mentioned. Heart failure we already talked about. Hypertension:

281
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
74 million people could have continuous blood-pressure monitoring

282
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to come up with much better management and prevention.

283
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And obesity we already talked about, the ways to get to that.

284
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And sleep disorders.

285
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
This is effective around the world. The access to smartphones

286
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and cell phones today is extraordinary.

287
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And this article from The Economist summed it up beautifully

288
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
about the opportunities in health across the developing world:

289
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
"Mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people,

290
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
more quickly, than any previous technology."

291
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And that's before we got going on the m-health world.

292
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Aging: The problem is enormous,

293
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
300,000 broken hips per year;

294
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
but the solutions are extraordinary,

295
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and they include so many different things.

296
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
One of the ones I just wanted to mention:

297
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
The iShoe is another example of a sensor that

298
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
improves proprioception among the elderly

299
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
to prevent falling.

300
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
One of many different techniques using wireless sensors.

301
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So, we can change medicine across the continuum of care,

302
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
across the ages from premies or unborn children

303
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
to seniors; the pharmaceutical arena changes;

304
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
the full spectrum of disease -- I hope I've given you a sense of that --

305
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
across the globe.

306
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
There are two things that can really accelerate this whole process.

307
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
One of them -- we're very fortunate -- is to develop a dedicated institute

308
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and that's work that started with the work that Scripps with Qualcomm ...

309
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and then the great fortune of meeting up with Gary and Mary West,

310
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
to get behind this wireless health institute.

311
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
San Diego is an extraordinary place for this.

312
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
There's over 650 wireless companies,

313
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
100 of which or more are working in wireless health.

314
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
It's the number one source of commerce, and interestingly

315
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
it dovetails beautifully with over 500 life science companies.

316
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
The wireless institute,

317
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
the West Wireless Health Institute,

318
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
is really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people

319
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
who are here this evening:

320
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Gary and Mary West. And I'd like to give it up for them for getting behind this.

321
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
(Applause)

322
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Their fantastic philanthropic investment made this possible,

323
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and this is really a nonprofit education center

324
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
which is just about to open. It looks like this,

325
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
this whole building dedicated.

326
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And what it's trying to do is accelerate this era:

327
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
to take unmet medical needs, to work and innovate --

328
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and we just appointed the chief engineer, Mehran Mehregany,

329
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
it was announced on Monday --

330
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
then to move up with development,

331
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
clinical trial validation and then changing medical practice,

332
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
the most challenging thing of all,

333
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
requiring attention to reimbursement, healthcare policy, healthcare economics.

334
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
The other big thing, besides having this fantastic

335
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
institute to catalyze this process

336
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
is guidance,

337
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and that's of course relying on the fact that medicine goes digital.

338
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
If we understand biology from genomics and omics

339
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and wireless through physiologic phenotyping, that's big.

340
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Because what it does is allow a convergence like we've never had before.

341
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Over 80 major diseases have been cracked at the genomic level,

342
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
but this is quite extraordinary: More has been learned about

343
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
the underpinnings of disease in the last two and a half years

344
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
than in the history of man.

345
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And when you put that together with, for example,

346
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
now an app for the iPhone with your genotype

347
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
to guide drug therapy ...

348
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
but, the future -- we can now tell who's going to get Type II diabetes

349
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
from all the common variants,

350
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and that's going to get filled in more

351
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
with low-frequency variants in the future.

352
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
We can tell who's going to get breast cancer

353
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
from the various genes.

354
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
We can also know who's likely to get atrial fibrillation.

355
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And finally, another example: sudden cardiac death.

356
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Each of these has a sensor.

357
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
We can give glucose a sensor for diabetes to prevent it.

358
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
We can prevent, or have the earliest detection possible,

359
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
for breast cancer with an ultrasound device

360
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
given to the patient.

361
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
An iPatch, iRhythm, for atrial fibrillation.

362
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And vital-signs monitoring to prevent sudden cardiac death.

363
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
We lose 700,000 people a year in the U.S. from sudden cardiac death.

364
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
So, I hope I've convinced you of this,

365
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
of the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound

366
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and then the impact on diseases is equally impressive

367
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
across all these different diseases and more.

368
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
It's really taking individualized medicine to a new height

369
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and it's hyper-innovative,

370
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and I think it represents the black swan of medicine.

371
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Thanks for your attention.

372
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
(Applause)

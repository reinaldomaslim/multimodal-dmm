0:00:21.553,000 --> 0:00:24,000
When I was 14 years old,

3
0:00:24.643,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I had low self-esteem.

4
0:00:26.63,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I felt I was not talented at anything.

5
0:00:31.314,000 --> 0:00:33,000
One day, I bought a yo-yo.

6
0:00:35.533,000 --> 0:00:38,000
When I tried my first trick, it looked like this:

7
0:00:40.771,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:45.553,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I couldn't even do the simplest trick,

9
0:00:48.355,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but it was very natural for me,

10
0:00:50.696,000 --> 0:00:53,000
because I was not dextrous, and hated all sports.

11
0:00:55.561,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But after one week of practicing,

12
0:00:58.322,000 --> 0:01:,000
my throws became more like this:

13
0:01:06.585,000 --> 0:01:07,000
A bit better.

14
0:01:08.834,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I thought, the yo-yo is something for me to be good at.

15
0:01:12.768,000 --> 0:01:14,000
For the first time in my life,

16
0:01:15.499,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I found my passion.

17
0:01:18.856,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I was spending all my time practicing.

18
0:01:21.849,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It took me hours and hours a day to build my skills up to the next level.

19
0:01:27.348,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And then, four years later, when I was 18 years old,

20
0:01:32.068,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I was standing onstage at the World YoYo Contest.

21
0:01:35.349,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And I won.

22
0:01:36.879,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I was so excited.

23
0:01:38.073,000 --> 0:01:4,000
"Yes, I did it! I became a hero.

24
0:01:40.676,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I may get many sponsors, a lot of money,

25
0:01:43.044,000 --> 0:01:45,000
tons of interviews, and be on TV!" I thought.

26
0:01:45.854,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:47.6,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But after coming back to Japan,

28
0:01:50.844,000 --> 0:01:53,000
totally nothing changed in my life.

29
0:01:53.872,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:55.607,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I realized society didn't value my passion.

31
0:02:00.168,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So I went back to my college

32
0:02:02.736,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and became a typical Japanese worker as a systems engineer.

33
0:02:07.244,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I felt my passion, heart and soul, had left my body.

34
0:02:13.575,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I felt I was not alive anymore.

35
0:02:16.394,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So I started to consider what I should do,

36
0:02:20.32,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and I thought, I wanted to make my performance better,

37
0:02:24.92,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and to show onstage how spectacular the yo-yo could be

38
0:02:29.374,000 --> 0:02:31,000
to change the public's image of the yo-yo.

39
0:02:33.521,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So I quit my company

40
0:02:36.409,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and started a career as a professional performer.

41
0:02:40.399,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I started to learn classic ballet, jazz dance, acrobatics and other things

42
0:02:45.078,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to make my performance better.

43
0:02:47.52,000 --> 0:02:5,000
As a result of these efforts, and the help of many others,

44
0:02:50.696,000 --> 0:02:51,000
it happened.

45
0:02:52.956,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I won the World YoYo Contest again in the artistic performance division.

46
0:02:57.458,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I passed an audition for Cirque Du Soleil.

47
0:03:00.751,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Today, I am standing on the TED stage

48
0:03:04.607,000 --> 0:03:06,000
with the yo-yo in front of you.

49
0:03:07.19,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Applause)

50
0:03:11.543,000 --> 0:03:14,000
What I learned from the yo-yo is,

51
0:03:14.833,000 --> 0:03:18,000
if I make enough effort with huge passion,

52
0:03:19.698,000 --> 0:03:2,000
there is no impossible.

53
0:03:22.096,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Could you let me share my passion with you

54
0:03:24.992,000 --> 0:03:25,000
through my performance?

55
0:03:26.647,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Applause)

56
0:03:57.997,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Water sound)

57
0:04:04.651,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Music)

58
0:07:46.79,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Music ends)

59
0:07:49.395,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Applause)

60
0:07:56.602,000 --> 0:08:03,000
(Music)

61
0:09:15.405,000 --> 0:09:19,000
(Music ends)

62
0:09:20.177,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Applause)

63
0:09:42.27,000 --> 0:09:45,000
(Applause ends)

64
0:09:45.533,000 --> 0:09:52,000
(Music)

65
0:10:15.738,000 --> 0:10:22,000
(Applause)

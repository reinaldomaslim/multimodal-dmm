1
0:00:12.884,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So I'm an artist,

2
0:00:14.656,000 --> 0:00:15,000
but a little bit of a peculiar one.

3
0:00:16.386,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I don't paint.

4
0:00:18.434,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I can't draw.

5
0:00:20.153,000 --> 0:00:23,000
My shop teacher in high school wrote that I was a menace

6
0:00:24.122,000 --> 0:00:25,000
on my report card.

7
0:00:25.953,000 --> 0:00:28,000
You probably don't really want to see my photographs.

8
0:00:29.991,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But there is one thing I know how to do:

9
0:00:31.98,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I know how to program a computer.

10
0:00:33.663,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I can code.

11
0:00:34.899,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And people will tell me that 100 years ago,

12
0:00:38.196,000 --> 0:00:39,000
folks like me didn't exist,

13
0:00:39.57,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that it was impossible,

14
0:00:41.684,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that art made with data is a new thing,

15
0:00:44.658,000 --> 0:00:46,000
it's a product of our age,

16
0:00:46.824,000 --> 0:00:47,000
it's something that's really important

17
0:00:48.735,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to think of as something that's very "now."

18
0:00:50.837,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And that's true.

19
0:00:52.029,000 --> 0:00:56,000
But there is an art form that's been around for a very long time

20
0:00:56.163,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that's really about using information,

21
0:00:58.058,000 --> 0:01:,000
abstract information,

22
0:01:00.168,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to make emotionally resonant pieces.

23
0:01:03.08,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And it's called music.

24
0:01:05.632,000 --> 0:01:08,000
We've been making music for tens of thousands of years, right?

25
0:01:09.528,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And if you think about what music is --

26
0:01:11.512,000 --> 0:01:13,000
notes and chords and keys and harmonies and melodies --

27
0:01:14.36,000 --> 0:01:15,000
these things are algorithms.

28
0:01:15.79,000 --> 0:01:16,000
These things are systems

29
0:01:17.641,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that are designed to unfold over time,

30
0:01:20.049,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to make us feel.

31
0:01:22.195,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I came to the arts through music.

32
0:01:23.831,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I was trained as a composer,

33
0:01:25.243,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and about 15 years ago, I started making pieces

34
0:01:28.549,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that were designed to look at the intersection

35
0:01:31.108,000 --> 0:01:32,000
between sound and image,

36
0:01:33.036,000 --> 0:01:35,000
to use an image to unveil a musical structure

37
0:01:35.892,000 --> 0:01:37,000
or to use a sound to show you something interesting

38
0:01:38.78,000 --> 0:01:4,000
about something that's usually pictorial.

39
0:01:40.804,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So what you're seeing on the screen is literally being drawn

40
0:01:44.295,000 --> 0:01:46,000
by the musical structure of the musicians onstage,

41
0:01:47.261,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and there's no accident that it looks like a plant,

42
0:01:49.817,000 --> 0:01:52,000
because the underlying algorithmic biology of the plant

43
0:01:53.18,000 --> 0:01:56,000
is what informed the musical structure in the first place.

44
0:01:56.515,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So once you know how to do this, once you know how to code with media,

45
0:01:59.943,000 --> 0:02:01,000
you can do some pretty cool stuff.

46
0:02:02.055,000 --> 0:02:05,000
This is a project I did for the Sundance Film Festival.

47
0:02:05.905,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Really simple idea: you take every Academy Award Best Picture,

48
0:02:11.178,000 --> 0:02:13,000
you speed it up to one minute each

49
0:02:13.563,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and string them all together.

50
0:02:15.168,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And so in 75 minutes, I can show you the history of Hollywood cinema.

51
0:02:19.592,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And what it really shows you is the history of editing

52
0:02:22.595,000 --> 0:02:23,000
in Hollywood cinema.

53
0:02:23.8,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So on the left, we've got Casablanca; on the right, we've got Chicago.

54
0:02:27.972,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And you can see that Casablanca is a little easier to read.

55
0:02:30.92,000 --> 0:02:33,000
That's because the average length of a cinematic shot in the 1940s

56
0:02:34.276,000 --> 0:02:35,000
was 26 seconds,

57
0:02:35.939,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and now it's around six seconds.

58
0:02:38.999,000 --> 0:02:39,000
This is a project that was inspired

59
0:02:40.767,000 --> 0:02:42,000
by some work that was funded by the US Federal Government

60
0:02:43.735,000 --> 0:02:44,000
in the early 2000s,

61
0:02:44.928,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to look at video footage and find a specific actor in any video.

62
0:02:51.605,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And so I repurposed this code to train a system on one person

63
0:02:56.305,000 --> 0:02:59,000
in our culture who would never need to be surveilled in that manner,

64
0:03:00.176,000 --> 0:03:01,000
which is Britney Spears.

65
0:03:01.727,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I downloaded 2,000 paparazzi photos of Britney Spears

66
0:03:05.243,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and trained my computer to find her face

67
0:03:07.743,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and her face alone.

68
0:03:09.148,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I can run any footage of her through it and will center her eyes in the frame,

69
0:03:13.448,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and this sort of is a little double commentary

70
0:03:15.648,000 --> 0:03:17,000
about surveillance in our society.

71
0:03:17.696,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We are very fraught with anxiety about being watched,

72
0:03:20.712,000 --> 0:03:22,000
but then we obsess over celebrity.

73
0:03:24.219,000 --> 0:03:27,000
What you're seeing on the screen here is a collaboration I did

74
0:03:27.973,000 --> 0:03:29,000
with an artist named Lián Amaris.

75
0:03:30.553,000 --> 0:03:33,000
What she did is very simple to explain and describe,

76
0:03:34.451,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but very hard to do.

77
0:03:35.707,000 --> 0:03:37,000
She took 72 minutes of activity,

78
0:03:39.208,000 --> 0:03:41,000
getting ready for a night out on the town,

79
0:03:41.805,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and stretched it over three days

80
0:03:43.918,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and performed it on a traffic island in slow motion in New York City.

81
0:03:47.949,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I was there, too, with a film crew.

82
0:03:50.192,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We filmed the whole thing,

83
0:03:51.468,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and then we reversed the process, speeding it up to 72 minutes again,

84
0:03:54.893,000 --> 0:03:55,000
so it looks like she's moving normally

85
0:03:56.811,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and the whole world is flying by.

86
0:03:59.091,000 --> 0:04:01,000
At a certain point, I figured out

87
0:04:01.691,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that what I was doing was making portraits.

88
0:04:05.5,000 --> 0:04:08,000
When you think about portraiture, you tend to think about stuff like this.

89
0:04:09.086,000 --> 0:04:11,000
The guy on the left is named Gilbert Stuart.

90
0:04:11.173,000 --> 0:04:14,000
He's sort of the first real portraitist of the United States.

91
0:04:14.261,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And on the right is his portrait of George Washington from 1796.

92
0:04:17.51,000 --> 0:04:19,000
This is the so-called Lansdowne portrait.

93
0:04:19.732,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And if you look at this painting, there's a lot of symbolism, right?

94
0:04:22.996,000 --> 0:04:24,000
We've got a rainbow out the window. We've got a sword.

95
0:04:25.68,000 --> 0:04:26,000
We've got a quill on the desk.

96
0:04:27.159,000 --> 0:04:28,000
All of these things are meant to evoke

97
0:04:29.032,000 --> 0:04:31,000
George Washington as the father of the nation.

98
0:04:31.832,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This is my portrait of George Washington.

99
0:04:35.776,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And this is an eye chart,

100
0:04:38.809,000 --> 0:04:4,000
only instead of letters, they're words.

101
0:04:41.713,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And what the words are is the 66 words

102
0:04:44.439,000 --> 0:04:46,000
in George Washington's State of the Union addresses

103
0:04:46.923,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that he uses more than any other president.

104
0:04:50.02,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So "gentlemen" has its own symbolism and its own rhetoric.

105
0:04:54.246,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And it's really kind of significant that that's the word he used the most.

106
0:04:58.862,000 --> 0:05:,000
This is the eye chart for George W. Bush,

107
0:05:01.005,000 --> 0:05:03,000
who was president when I made this piece.

108
0:05:04.009,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And how you get there,

109
0:05:05.201,000 --> 0:05:08,000
from "gentlemen" to "terror" in 43 easy steps,

110
0:05:08.677,000 --> 0:05:1,000
tells us a lot about American history,

111
0:05:10.761,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and gives you a different insight

112
0:05:12.372,000 --> 0:05:14,000
than you would have looking at a series of paintings.

113
0:05:15.333,000 --> 0:05:18,000
These pieces provide a history lesson of the United States

114
0:05:19.291,000 --> 0:05:21,000
through the political rhetoric of its leaders.

115
0:05:21.571,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Ronald Reagan spent a lot of time talking about deficits.

116
0:05:25.135,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Bill Clinton spent a lot of time

117
0:05:26.724,000 --> 0:05:29,000
talking about the century in which he would no longer be president,

118
0:05:30.032,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but maybe his wife would be.

119
0:05:33.148,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Lyndon Johnson was the first President

120
0:05:35.808,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to give his State of the Union addresses on prime-time television;

121
0:05:39.014,000 --> 0:05:41,000
he began every paragraph with the word "tonight."

122
0:05:41.378,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And Richard Nixon, or more accurately, his speechwriter,

123
0:05:44.068,000 --> 0:05:45,000
a guy named William Safire,

124
0:05:45.42,000 --> 0:05:47,000
spent a lot of time thinking about language

125
0:05:47.492,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and making sure that his boss portrayed a rhetoric of honesty.

126
0:05:51.449,000 --> 0:05:53,000
This project is shown as a series of monolithic sculptures.

127
0:05:54.375,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It's an outdoor series of light boxes.

128
0:05:56.847,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And it's important to note that they're to scale,

129
0:05:59.301,000 --> 0:06:02,000
so if you stand 20 feet back and you can read between those two black lines,

130
0:06:02.939,000 --> 0:06:03,000
you have 20/20 vision.

131
0:06:04.114,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Laughter)

132
0:06:05.176,000 --> 0:06:07,000
This is a portrait. And there's a lot of these.

133
0:06:07.505,000 --> 0:06:1,000
There's a lot of ways to do this with data.

134
0:06:10.791,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I started looking for a way

135
0:06:12.435,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to think about how I can do a more democratic form of portraiture,

136
0:06:17.164,000 --> 0:06:21,000
something that's more about my country and how it works.

137
0:06:21.419,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Every 10 years, we make a census in the United States.

138
0:06:25.244,000 --> 0:06:26,000
We literally count people,

139
0:06:27.306,000 --> 0:06:3,000
find out who lives where, what kind of jobs we've got,

140
0:06:30.474,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the language we speak at home.

141
0:06:31.975,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And this is important stuff -- really important stuff.

142
0:06:34.57,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But it doesn't really tell us who we are.

143
0:06:36.827,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It doesn't tell us about our dreams and our aspirations.

144
0:06:39.522,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And so in 2010, I decided to make my own census.

145
0:06:42.936,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And I started looking for a corpus of data

146
0:06:46.28,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that had a lot of descriptions written by ordinary Americans.

147
0:06:49.416,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And it turns out

148
0:06:50.591,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that there is such a corpus of data

149
0:06:52.357,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that's just sitting there for the taking.

150
0:06:54.365,000 --> 0:06:55,000
It's called online dating.

151
0:06:56.574,000 --> 0:07:,000
So in 2010, I joined 21 different online dating services,

152
0:07:01.544,000 --> 0:07:04,000
as a gay man, a straight man, a gay woman and a straight woman,

153
0:07:04.668,000 --> 0:07:05,000
in every zip code in America

154
0:07:06.309,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and downloaded about 19 million people's dating profiles --

155
0:07:09.518,000 --> 0:07:12,000
about 20 percent of the adult population of the United States.

156
0:07:13.241,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I have obsessive-compulsive disorder.

157
0:07:15.084,000 --> 0:07:18,000
This is going to become really freaking obvious. Just go with me.

158
0:07:18.209,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

159
0:07:19.375,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So what I did was I sorted all this stuff by zip code.

160
0:07:23.922,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And I looked at word analysis.

161
0:07:25.437,000 --> 0:07:27,000
These are some dating profiles from 2010

162
0:07:28.134,000 --> 0:07:3,000
with the word "lonely" highlighted.

163
0:07:30.253,000 --> 0:07:32,000
If you look at these things topographically,

164
0:07:33.258,000 --> 0:07:36,000
if you imagine dark colors to light colors are more use of the word,

165
0:07:36.782,000 --> 0:07:4,000
you can see that Appalachia is a pretty lonely place.

166
0:07:41.979,000 --> 0:07:45,000
You can also see that Nebraska ain't that funny.

167
0:07:48.385,000 --> 0:07:51,000
This is the kinky map, so what this is showing you

168
0:07:54.033,000 --> 0:07:57,000
is that the women in Alaska need to get together

169
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
with the men in southern New Mexico,

170
0:07:58.959,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and have a good time.

171
0:08:00.323,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And I have this at a pretty granular level,

172
0:08:03.213,000 --> 0:08:06,000
so I can tell you that the men in the eastern half of Long Island

173
0:08:06.344,000 --> 0:08:07,000
are way more interested in being spanked

174
0:08:08.294,000 --> 0:08:1,000
than men in the western half of Long Island.

175
0:08:11.851,000 --> 0:08:13,000
This will be your one takeaway from this whole conference.

176
0:08:14.725,000 --> 0:08:16,000
You're going to remember that fact for, like, 30 years.

177
0:08:17.489,000 --> 0:08:19,000
(Laughter)

178
0:08:20.655,000 --> 0:08:22,000
When you bring this down to a cartographic level,

179
0:08:23.102,000 --> 0:08:26,000
you can make maps and do the same trick I was doing with the eye charts.

180
0:08:26.58,000 --> 0:08:28,000
You can replace the name of every city in the United States

181
0:08:29.421,000 --> 0:08:31,000
with the word people use more in that city than anywhere else.

182
0:08:32.437,000 --> 0:08:35,000
If you've ever dated anyone from Seattle, this makes perfect sense.

183
0:08:35.69,000 --> 0:08:37,000
You've got "pretty." You've got "heartbreak."

184
0:08:38.416,000 --> 0:08:4,000
You've got "gig." You've got "cigarette."

185
0:08:40.855,000 --> 0:08:42,000
They play in a band and they smoke.

186
0:08:43.604,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And right above that you can see "email."

187
0:08:45.612,000 --> 0:08:46,000
That's Redmond, Washington,

188
0:08:46.942,000 --> 0:08:48,000
which is the headquarters of the Microsoft Corporation.

189
0:08:49.561,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Some of these you can guess -- so, Los Angeles is "acting"

190
0:08:52.409,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and San Francisco is "gay."

191
0:08:54.051,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Some are a little bit more heartbreaking.

192
0:08:56.067,000 --> 0:08:58,000
In Baton Rouge, they talk about being curvy;

193
0:08:58.172,000 --> 0:09:,000
downstream in New Orleans, they still talk about the flood.

194
0:09:01.083,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Folks in the American capital will say they're interesting.

195
0:09:03.912,000 --> 0:09:05,000
People in Baltimore, Maryland, will say they're afraid.

196
0:09:06.713,000 --> 0:09:07,000
This is New Jersey.

197
0:09:08.274,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I grew up somewhere between "annoying" and "cynical."

198
0:09:10.987,000 --> 0:09:14,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

199
0:09:15.25,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And New York City's number one word is "now,"

200
0:09:17.931,000 --> 0:09:2,000
as in, "Now I'm working as a waiter, but actually I'm an actor."

201
0:09:21.201,000 --> 0:09:22,000
(Laughter)

202
0:09:22.323,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Or, "Now I'm a professor of engineering at NYU, but actually I'm an artist."

203
0:09:26.642,000 --> 0:09:27,000
If you go upstate, you see "dinosaur."

204
0:09:28.591,000 --> 0:09:29,000
That's Syracuse.

205
0:09:29.766,000 --> 0:09:31,000
The best place to eat in Syracuse, New York,

206
0:09:31.863,000 --> 0:09:33,000
is a Hell's Angels barbecue joint called Dinosaur Barbecue.

207
0:09:34.681,000 --> 0:09:36,000
That's where you would take somebody on a date.

208
0:09:36.927,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I live somewhere between "unconditional" and "midsummer," in Midtown Manhattan.

209
0:09:40.757,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And this is gentrified North Brooklyn,

210
0:09:42.828,000 --> 0:09:45,000
so you've got "DJ" and "glamorous" and "hipsters" and "urbane."

211
0:09:46.048,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So that's maybe a more democratic portrait.

212
0:09:48.494,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And the idea was, what if we made red-state and blue-state maps

213
0:09:51.587,000 --> 0:09:53,000
based on what we want to do on a Friday night?

214
0:09:53.78,000 --> 0:09:54,000
This is a self-portrait.

215
0:09:55.77,000 --> 0:09:56,000
This is based on my email,

216
0:09:57.051,000 --> 0:09:59,000
about 500,000 emails sent over 20 years.

217
0:10:00.044,000 --> 0:10:02,000
You can think of this as a quantified selfie.

218
0:10:03.021,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So what I'm doing is running a physics equation

219
0:10:06.139,000 --> 0:10:07,000
based on my personal data.

220
0:10:07.561,000 --> 0:10:09,000
You have to imagine everybody I've ever corresponded with.

221
0:10:10.328,000 --> 0:10:13,000
It started out in the middle and it exploded with a big bang.

222
0:10:13.751,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And everybody has gravity to one another,

223
0:10:15.953,000 --> 0:10:17,000
gravity based on how much they've been emailing,

224
0:10:18.238,000 --> 0:10:19,000
who they've been emailing with.

225
0:10:19.77,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And it also does sentimental analysis,

226
0:10:21.626,000 --> 0:10:23,000
so if I say "I love you," you're heavier to me.

227
0:10:23.939,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And you attract to my email addresses in the middle,

228
0:10:26.459,000 --> 0:10:28,000
which act like mainline stars.

229
0:10:28.578,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And all the names are handwritten.

230
0:10:30.917,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Sometimes you do this data and this work with real-time data

231
0:10:34.649,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to illuminate a specific problem in a specific city.

232
0:10:38.071,000 --> 0:10:4,000
This is a Walther PPK 9mm semiautomatic handgun

233
0:10:40.771,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that was used in a shooting in the French Quarter of New Orleans

234
0:10:43.826,000 --> 0:10:46,000
about two years ago on Valentine's Day in an argument over parking.

235
0:10:47.159,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Those are my cigarettes.

236
0:10:48.398,000 --> 0:10:5,000
This is the house where the shooting took place.

237
0:10:50.697,000 --> 0:10:52,000
This project involved a little bit of engineering.

238
0:10:53.095,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I've got a bike chain rigged up as a cam shaft,

239
0:10:55.334,000 --> 0:10:56,000
with a computer driving it.

240
0:10:56.674,000 --> 0:10:58,000
That computer and the mechanism are buried in a box.

241
0:10:59.464,000 --> 0:11:01,000
The gun's on top welded to a steel plate.

242
0:11:01.702,000 --> 0:11:03,000
There's a wire going through to the trigger,

243
0:11:04.071,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and the computer in the box is online.

244
0:11:06.286,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It's listening to the 911 feed of the New Orleans Police Department,

245
0:11:09.543,000 --> 0:11:11,000
so that anytime there's a shooting reported in New Orleans,

246
0:11:12.444,000 --> 0:11:13,000
(Gunshot sound)

247
0:11:13.469,000 --> 0:11:14,000
the gun fires.

248
0:11:15.3,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Now, there's a blank, so there's no bullet.

249
0:11:18.008,000 --> 0:11:2,000
There's big light, big noise

250
0:11:20.106,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and most importantly, there's a casing.

251
0:11:22.452,000 --> 0:11:24,000
There's about five shootings a day in New Orleans,

252
0:11:24.872,000 --> 0:11:26,000
so over the four months this piece was installed,

253
0:11:27.237,000 --> 0:11:28,000
the case filled up with bullets.

254
0:11:29.642,000 --> 0:11:32,000
You guys know what this is -- you call this "data visualization."

255
0:11:34.559,000 --> 0:11:36,000
When you do it right, it's illuminating.

256
0:11:36.591,000 --> 0:11:38,000
When you do it wrong, it's anesthetizing.

257
0:11:39.656,000 --> 0:11:4,000
It reduces people to numbers.

258
0:11:41.335,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So watch out.

259
0:11:44.654,000 --> 0:11:45,000
One last piece for you.

260
0:11:46.466,000 --> 0:11:48,000
I spent the last summer as the artist in residence

261
0:11:49.272,000 --> 0:11:5,000
for Times Square.

262
0:11:50.932,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And Times Square in New York is literally the crossroads of the world.

263
0:11:54.599,000 --> 0:11:56,000
One of the things people don't notice about it

264
0:11:56.8,000 --> 0:11:58,000
is it's the most Instagrammed place on Earth.

265
0:11:59.903,000 --> 0:12:01,000
About every five seconds, someone commits a selfie

266
0:12:02.809,000 --> 0:12:03,000
in Times Square.

267
0:12:04.424,000 --> 0:12:07,000
That's 17,000 a day, and I have them all.

268
0:12:07.697,000 --> 0:12:08,000
(Laughter)

269
0:12:08.806,000 --> 0:12:1,000
These are some of them with their eyes centered.

270
0:12:11.122,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Every civilization,

271
0:12:12.183,000 --> 0:12:14,000
will use the maximum level of technology available to make art.

272
0:12:15.132,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And it's the responsibility of the artist to ask questions

273
0:12:17.964,000 --> 0:12:18,000
about what that technology means

274
0:12:19.619,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and how it reflects our culture.

275
0:12:21.662,000 --> 0:12:23,000
So I leave you with this: we're more than numbers.

276
0:12:24.172,000 --> 0:12:26,000
We're people, and we have dreams and ideas.

277
0:12:26.197,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And reducing us to statistics is something that's done

278
0:12:29.02,000 --> 0:12:3,000
at our peril.

279
0:12:30.295,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Thank you very much.

280
0:12:31.497,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Applause)

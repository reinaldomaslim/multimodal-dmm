1
0:00:12.954,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So what I'm doing

2
0:00:15.006,000 --> 0:00:18,000
is a thought experiment.

3
0:00:19.558,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Now you may know of or have read

4
0:00:22.602,000 --> 0:00:23,000
this book by this guy.

5
0:00:24.04,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It's probably the first and maybe the only bestseller

6
0:00:27.942,000 --> 0:00:28,000
ever written about economics.

7
0:00:30.092,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And you probably know a bit about what it says.

8
0:00:33.55,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It talks about how nations all over the world will prosper

9
0:00:39.661,000 --> 0:00:42,000
through the individual pursuit of individual profit.

10
0:00:44.153,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Individual profit will be the mechanism for the prosperity of the world.

11
0:00:49.717,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But the funny thing about Adam Smith

12
0:00:52.134,000 --> 0:00:54,000
is that he was a stay-at-home kind of guy.

13
0:00:55.073,000 --> 0:00:58,000
He actually never went further from Edinburgh

14
0:00:58.332,000 --> 0:01:,000
than France and Switzerland.

15
0:01:01.685,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So my thought experiment is to imagine

16
0:01:05.867,000 --> 0:01:08,000
what would have happened if Adam Smith had visited Africa.

17
0:01:10.917,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And fortunately, there's actually an easy answer,

18
0:01:15.868,000 --> 0:01:2,000
because the Arab lawyer and traveler Ibn Battuta

19
0:01:21.902,000 --> 0:01:24,000
traveled down the east coast of Africa in the 14th century,

20
0:01:26.701,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and what he found when he got to Mogadishu was a market,

21
0:01:29.444,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and he wrote about it.

22
0:01:30.971,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And basically, merchant ships came to the harbor,

23
0:01:34.964,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and they weren't even allowed to land.

24
0:01:36.847,000 --> 0:01:37,000
They had to drop anchor in the harbor,

25
0:01:38.748,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and boats came out to them,

26
0:01:40.41,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and locals picked them and said, "You are my guest, I am now your broker."

27
0:01:45.984,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And they had to do business through the local broker,

28
0:01:49.788,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and if they went around that and didn't do business through the broker,

29
0:01:53.297,000 --> 0:01:57,000
they could go to court, and the deal would be canceled,

30
0:01:57.688,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and they would be thrown out of town.

31
0:01:59.55,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And through this mechanism, everyone prospered.

32
0:02:03.502,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And so if that was Adam Smith, he might look like this guy

33
0:02:06.381,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and say, "Ah! That's a mutual aid society.

34
0:02:09.965,000 --> 0:02:11,000
That's a share-the-wealth free market."

35
0:02:12.62,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And when I put this question to Christian [Benimana],

36
0:02:15.286,000 --> 0:02:18,000
who had the stage at the beginning of this session,

37
0:02:18.782,000 --> 0:02:2,000
he responded that if Adam Smith had come to Africa,

38
0:02:21.679,000 --> 0:02:25,000
there would have been a sharing economy long before Airbnb and Uber.

39
0:02:25.899,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And that's true.

40
0:02:27.714,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So if we put this to work today,

41
0:02:31.358,000 --> 0:02:32,000
it would be very interesting.

42
0:02:32.804,000 --> 0:02:34,000
There would be a lot of money flowing into the countries.

43
0:02:35.508,000 --> 0:02:4,000
These are just figures of 10 percent of exports in these countries.

44
0:02:41.633,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So the interesting thing is that this mutual aid economy still exists,

45
0:02:47.993,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and we can find examples of it in the strangest places.

46
0:02:51.851,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So, this is Alaba International Market.

47
0:02:54.329,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It's the largest electronics market in West Africa.

48
0:02:58.96,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It's 10,000 merchants,

49
0:03:00.362,000 --> 0:03:03,000
they do about four billion dollars of turnover every year.

50
0:03:03.452,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And they say they are ardent apostles of Adam Smith:

51
0:03:06.11,000 --> 0:03:08,000
competition is great, we're all in it individually,

52
0:03:08.842,000 --> 0:03:09,000
government doesn't help us.

53
0:03:10.808,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But the interesting reality is that when I asked further,

54
0:03:14.128,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that's not what grew the market at all.

55
0:03:17.777,000 --> 0:03:19,000
There's a behind-the-scenes principle

56
0:03:20.705,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that enables this market to grow.

57
0:03:25.194,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And they do claim -- you know, this is an interesting juxtaposition

58
0:03:28.553,000 --> 0:03:31,000
of the King James Bible and "How To Sell Yourself."

59
0:03:31.964,000 --> 0:03:33,000
That's what they say is their message.

60
0:03:34.652,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But in reality, this market is governed by a sharing principle.

61
0:03:39.705,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Every merchant, when you ask them, "How did you get started in global trade?"

62
0:03:44.507,000 --> 0:03:47,000
they say, "Well, when my master settled me."

63
0:03:48.262,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And when I finally got it into my head to ask, "What is this 'settling?'"

64
0:03:52.487,000 --> 0:03:54,000
it turns out that when you've done your apprenticeship

65
0:03:55.185,000 --> 0:03:56,000
with someone you work for,

66
0:03:56.728,000 --> 0:03:59,000
they are required -- required -- to set you up in business.

67
0:04:00.746,000 --> 0:04:02,000
That means paying your rent for two or three years

68
0:04:03.321,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and giving you a cash infusion

69
0:04:05.373,000 --> 0:04:07,000
so you can go out in the world and start trading.

70
0:04:09.018,000 --> 0:04:12,000
That's locally generated venture capital. Right?

71
0:04:12.14,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And I can say with almost certainty

72
0:04:14.542,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that the Igbo apprenticeship system that governs Alaba International Market

73
0:04:20.459,000 --> 0:04:25,000
is the largest business incubator platform in the world.

74
0:04:26.634,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And there are other sharing economies that we look for --

75
0:04:30.489,000 --> 0:04:33,000
merry-go-rounds, which are found in almost every shantytown.

76
0:04:33.884,000 --> 0:04:36,000
They have different names in other cultures; this is the Kenyan name.

77
0:04:37.202,000 --> 0:04:38,000
It's a way of generating cash.

78
0:04:38.809,000 --> 0:04:4,000
It's a kitty -- people throw money into a pot once a week,

79
0:04:41.568,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and once a week, one member of the group gets the money,

80
0:04:44.233,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and they can spend it on whatever they need to.

81
0:04:46.451,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And there's also something called "acequias,"

82
0:04:49.062,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and that is a Spanish word, but it comes from the North African Arabic;

83
0:04:53.428,000 --> 0:04:54,000
"saqiya" means "water wheel."

84
0:04:55.42,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And what the acequia is is a sharing system for scarce water.

85
0:04:59.72,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It's migrated from North Africa to Spain,

86
0:05:03.086,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and from Spain to the west of the United States,

87
0:05:05.722,000 --> 0:05:06,000
where it still is used.

88
0:05:07.862,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And it shares water by need

89
0:05:11.67,000 --> 0:05:13,000
rather than by who was there first.

90
0:05:15.338,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And contrary, with all due respect, to what Llew [Claasen] said

91
0:05:19.158,000 --> 0:05:23,000
when he talked about blockchains and cryptocurrencies yesterday,

92
0:05:23.944,000 --> 0:05:25,000
there is no tragedy of the commons.

93
0:05:26.959,000 --> 0:05:3,000
People in acequias have been commonly managing scarce water resources

94
0:05:31.718,000 --> 0:05:34,000
for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years.

95
0:05:36.717,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So taking this thought experiment, I wanted to go a little bit further

96
0:05:41.385,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and suggest that these things are managed communally,

97
0:05:48.184,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and they are taking care of scarce capital, scarce cash

98
0:05:54.325,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and scarce resources.

99
0:05:57.383,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And it seems to me that we have actually two kinds of capitalism.

100
0:06:03.43,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We have the capitalism of the top up.

101
0:06:06.907,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And these are really interesting statistics,

102
0:06:09.369,000 --> 0:06:15,000
because three one-thousandths of one percent of the Nigerian population

103
0:06:15.621,000 --> 0:06:2,000
controls wealth equal to one-fourth of the GDP of the country.

104
0:06:21.91,000 --> 0:06:24,000
One one-hundredth of one percent of the Kenyan population

105
0:06:25.121,000 --> 0:06:3,000
controls wealth equal to 75 percent of the GDP of the country.

106
0:06:31.412,000 --> 0:06:33,000
That's the capitalism of top up.

107
0:06:35.069,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And everyone else is with this guy,

108
0:06:37.951,000 --> 0:06:39,000
selling board games and bodybuilding equipment

109
0:06:40.498,000 --> 0:06:42,000
in a go-slow on the highway in Lagos.

110
0:06:43.409,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And when you're selling board games and bodybuilding equipment in a go-slow,

111
0:06:47.122,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that traffic jam is really, really, really bad, right?

112
0:06:51.689,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Those of us in this sphere of the economy

113
0:06:54.235,000 --> 0:06:57,000
are caught in what I call "the capitalism of decay,"

114
0:06:58.32,000 --> 0:07:01,000
because there's no way to rise up and get out of it,

115
0:07:02.352,000 --> 0:07:04,000
because they're lacking the resources that we talked about

116
0:07:05.12,000 --> 0:07:06,000
in those sharing economies.

117
0:07:06.705,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And they're tripped up

118
0:07:08.707,000 --> 0:07:13,000
by the thesis of cassava and capitalism,

119
0:07:13.769,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that cassava has to be processed in order not to be poisonous,

120
0:07:18.13,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and I would argue that, similarly,

121
0:07:21.299,000 --> 0:07:26,000
the market economy needs to be processed in order to be fair to everyone.

122
0:07:28.747,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So we have to look at what I call the "bottom down economy."

123
0:07:33.426,000 --> 0:07:36,000
These are these sharing models that exist out there

124
0:07:37.29,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that need to be propagated and used and scaled.

125
0:07:41.659,000 --> 0:07:42,000
OK?

126
0:07:42.954,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And if we propagate these things,

127
0:07:45.08,000 --> 0:07:47,000
we can begin to bring infrastructure to everyone,

128
0:07:48.85,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and that will ensure that communities

129
0:07:51.657,000 --> 0:07:53,000
are leading their own development,

130
0:07:55.595,000 --> 0:07:57,000
which is, I believe, what we need in the world,

131
0:07:58.288,000 --> 0:08:,000
and, I would suggest, what we need in Africa.

132
0:08:01.903,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I wanted to quote Steve Biko,

133
0:08:05.225,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and I thought it was really important to quote Steve Biko,

134
0:08:08.026,000 --> 0:08:12,000
because next month, September 12 to be exact,

135
0:08:12.369,000 --> 0:08:16,000
is the 40th anniversary of his murder by the South African state.

136
0:08:18.097,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And you can read the quote.

137
0:08:20.163,000 --> 0:08:23,000
He basically said that we're not here to compete.

138
0:08:24.064,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And I love this quote: "... to make us a community of brothers and sisters

139
0:08:28.007,000 --> 0:08:31,000
jointly involved in the quest for a composite answer

140
0:08:31.12,000 --> 0:08:32,000
to the varied problems of life."

141
0:08:33.848,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And he also said that "the great powers of the world

142
0:08:37.04,000 --> 0:08:4,000
have done wonders in giving us an industrial and military look, ..."

143
0:08:40.894,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and we don't have to copy that military-industrialist complex,

144
0:08:44.617,000 --> 0:08:46,000
because Africa can do things differently

145
0:08:47.087,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and restore the humanity of the world.

146
0:08:51.825,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And so what I want to suggest here

147
0:08:55.305,000 --> 0:08:56,000
is that we have an opportunity,

148
0:08:58.314,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that we are all here in the mutual landscape

149
0:09:02.592,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to be able to do things,

150
0:09:05.618,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and that the journey starts now.

151
0:09:09.318,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Thank you very much.

152
0:09:10.5,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Applause)

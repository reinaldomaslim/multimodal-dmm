2
0:00:16.592,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So I tried to do a small good thing for my wife.

3
0:00:20.677,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It makes me to stand here,

4
0:00:23.039,000 --> 0:00:25,000
the fame, the money I got out of it.

5
0:00:25.693,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So what I did, I'd gone back to my early marriage days.

6
0:00:29.226,000 --> 0:00:3,000
What you did in the early marriage days,

7
0:00:31.155,000 --> 0:00:33,000
you tried to impress your wife. I did the same.

8
0:00:33.974,000 --> 0:00:35,000
On that occasion, I found my wife

9
0:00:36.809,000 --> 0:00:38,000
carrying something like this.

10
0:00:38.98,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I saw. "What is that?" I asked.

11
0:00:41.22,000 --> 0:00:44,000
My wife replied, "None of your business."

12
0:00:44.489,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Then, being her husband, I ran behind her

13
0:00:46.58,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and saw she had a nasty rag cloth.

14
0:00:48.116,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I don't even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler.

15
0:00:51.084,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Then I understood this -- adapting that unhygienic method

16
0:00:53.886,000 --> 0:00:55,000
to manage her period days.

17
0:00:56.187,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Then I immediately asked her, why are you [using] that unhygienic method?

18
0:00:57.972,000 --> 0:01:,000
She replied, I also know about [sanitary pads],

19
0:01:01.51,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but myself and my sisters, if they start using that,

20
0:01:04.585,000 --> 0:01:06,000
we have to cut our family milk budget.

21
0:01:07.169,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Then I was shocked. What is the connection between

22
0:01:08.488,000 --> 0:01:09,000
using a sanitary pad and a milk budget?

23
0:01:09.953,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And it's called affordability.

24
0:01:12.443,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads.

25
0:01:16.765,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I went to a local shop, I tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet.

26
0:01:19.926,000 --> 0:01:2,000
That fellow looks left and right,

27
0:01:21.519,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and spreads a newspaper, rolls it into the newspaper,

28
0:01:23.96,000 --> 0:01:26,000
gives it to me like a banned item, something like that.

29
0:01:27.744,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I don't know why. I did not ask for a condom.

30
0:01:31.543,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Then I took that pad. I want to see that. What is inside it?

31
0:01:35.664,000 --> 0:01:38,000
The very first time, at the age of 29,

32
0:01:39.619,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that day I am touching the sanitary pad, first ever.

33
0:01:41.694,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I must know: How many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad?

34
0:01:46.754,000 --> 0:01:5,000
They are not going to touch that, because it's not your matter.

35
0:01:51.394,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Then I thought to myself, white substance, made of cotton --

36
0:01:54.622,000 --> 0:01:57,000
oh my God, that guy is just using a penny value of raw material --

37
0:01:57.963,000 --> 0:01:59,000
inside they are selling for pounds, dollars.

38
0:02:00.517,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife?

39
0:02:05.331,000 --> 0:02:08,000
That's how all this started, but after making a sanitary pad,

40
0:02:08.34,000 --> 0:02:09,000
where can I check it?

41
0:02:09.736,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It's not like I can just check it in the lab.

42
0:02:12.962,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I need a woman volunteer. Where can I get one in India?

43
0:02:15.912,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Even in Bangalore you won't get [one], in India.

44
0:02:19.492,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So only problem: the only available victim is my wife.

45
0:02:24.896,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti -- my wife's name is Shanti.

46
0:02:29.496,000 --> 0:02:3,000
"Close your eyes. Whatever I give,

47
0:02:30.8,000 --> 0:02:31,000
it will be not a diamond pendant

48
0:02:32.412,000 --> 0:02:33,000
not a diamond ring, even a chocolate,

49
0:02:33.961,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it.

50
0:02:37.465,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Close your eyes."

51
0:02:39.416,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Because I tried to make it intimate.

52
0:02:42.49,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Because it's an arranged marriage, not a love marriage.

53
0:02:45.701,000 --> 0:02:47,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:48.22,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So one day she said, openly, I'm not going to support this research.

55
0:02:51.799,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Then other victims, they got into my sisters.

56
0:02:54.915,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But even sisters, wives, they're not ready to support in the research.

57
0:02:58.312,000 --> 0:03:01,000
That's why I am always jealous with the saints in India.

58
0:03:01.354,000 --> 0:03:04,000
They are having a lot of women volunteers around them.

59
0:03:04.913,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Why I am not getting [any]?

60
0:03:06.609,000 --> 0:03:14,000
You know, without them even calling, they'll get a lot of women volunteers.

61
0:03:14.697,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Then I used, tried to use the medical college girls.

62
0:03:17.78,000 --> 0:03:19,000
They also refused. Finally, I decide,

63
0:03:20.389,000 --> 0:03:22,000
use sanitary pad myself.

64
0:03:23.24,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Now I am having a title like

65
0:03:25.371,000 --> 0:03:29,000
the first man to set foot on the moon.

66
0:03:29.548,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Armstrong. Then Tenzing [and] Hillary, in Everest,

67
0:03:32.716,000 --> 0:03:33,000
like that Muruganantham is the first man

68
0:03:34.605,000 --> 0:03:37,000
wore a sanitary pad across the globe.

69
0:03:38.517,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I wore a sanitary pad. I filled animal blood in a football bottle,

70
0:03:41.781,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I tied it up here, there is a tube going into my panties,

71
0:03:44.467,000 --> 0:03:46,000
while I'm walking, while I'm cycling, I made a press,

72
0:03:47.091,000 --> 0:03:49,000
doses of blood will go there.

73
0:03:49.407,000 --> 0:03:53,000
That makes me bow down to any woman in front of me

74
0:03:53.435,000 --> 0:03:55,000
to give full respect. That five days I'll never forget --

75
0:03:56.413,000 --> 0:03:58,000
the messy days, the lousy days, that wetness.

76
0:03:59.069,000 --> 0:04:04,000
My God, it's unbelievable.

77
0:04:04.723,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But here the problem is, one company is making napkin

78
0:04:09.484,000 --> 0:04:11,000
out of cotton. It is working well.

79
0:04:11.9,000 --> 0:04:14,000
But I am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton. It's not working.

80
0:04:14.908,000 --> 0:04:17,000
That makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research.

81
0:04:18.492,000 --> 0:04:19,000
You need first funds.

82
0:04:20.193,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Not only financial crises, but because of the sanitary pad research,

83
0:04:23.511,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I come through all sorts of problems, including

84
0:04:27.227,000 --> 0:04:29,000
a divorce notice from my wife.

85
0:04:29.63,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Why is this? I used medical college girls.

86
0:04:32.725,000 --> 0:04:34,000
She suspects I am using as a trump card

87
0:04:35.579,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to run behind medical college girls.

88
0:04:38.035,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Finally, I came to know it is a special cellulose

89
0:04:41.278,000 --> 0:04:43,000
derived from a pinewood, but even after that,

90
0:04:43.686,000 --> 0:04:45,000
you need a multimillion-dollar plant like this

91
0:04:45.688,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to process that material. Again, a stop-up.

92
0:04:49.05,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Then I spend another four years to create my own

93
0:04:52.812,000 --> 0:04:54,000
machine tools, a simple machine tool like this.

94
0:04:55.475,000 --> 0:04:58,000
In this machine, any rural woman can apply the same

95
0:04:58.719,000 --> 0:05:,000
raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant,

96
0:05:01.563,000 --> 0:05:04,000
anyone can make a world-class napkin at your dining hall.

97
0:05:05.255,000 --> 0:05:08,000
That is my invention.

98
0:05:08.472,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So after that, what I did,

99
0:05:11.195,000 --> 0:05:14,000
usually if anyone got a patent or an invention,

100
0:05:14.658,000 --> 0:05:17,000
immediately you want to make, convert into this.

101
0:05:18.201,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I never did this. I dropped it just like this,

102
0:05:21.251,000 --> 0:05:24,000
because you do this, if anyone runs after money,

103
0:05:24.835,000 --> 0:05:27,000
their life will not [have] any beauty. It is boredom.

104
0:05:28.552,000 --> 0:05:3,000
A lot of people making a lot of money, billion,

105
0:05:30.563,000 --> 0:05:32,000
billions of dollars accumulating.

106
0:05:32.717,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Why are they coming for, finally, for philanthropy?

107
0:05:34.963,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Why the need for accumulating money, then doing philanthropy?

108
0:05:38.48,000 --> 0:05:41,000
What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one?

109
0:05:41.789,000 --> 0:05:44,000
That's why I am giving this machine

110
0:05:45.337,000 --> 0:05:48,000
only in rural India, for rural women, because in India,

111
0:05:49.275,000 --> 0:05:51,000
[you'll be] surprised, only two percent of women

112
0:05:51.751,000 --> 0:05:54,000
are using sanitary pads. The rest, they're using a rag cloth,

113
0:05:55.092,000 --> 0:05:58,000
a leaf, husk, [saw] dust, everything except sanitary pads.

114
0:05:58.952,000 --> 0:06:,000
It is the same in the 21st century. That's why I am going

115
0:06:01.339,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to decide to give this machine only for poor women across India.

116
0:06:04.88,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So far, 630 installations happened in 23 states

117
0:06:08.261,000 --> 0:06:1,000
in six other countries.

118
0:06:10.897,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Now I'm on my seventh year sustaining against

119
0:06:15.379,000 --> 0:06:2,000
multinational, transnational giants -- makes all MBA students a question mark.

120
0:06:20.397,000 --> 0:06:23,000
A school dropout from Coimbatore, how he is able to sustaining?

121
0:06:23.682,000 --> 0:06:29,000
That makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all IIMs.

122
0:06:29.782,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Applause)

123
0:06:34.945,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Play video one.

124
0:06:37.79,000 --> 0:06:42,000
(Video) Arunachalam Muruganantham: The thing I saw in my wife's hand, "Why are you using that nasty cloth?"

125
0:06:42.962,000 --> 0:06:46,000
She replied immediately, "I know about napkins, but if I start

126
0:06:47.275,000 --> 0:06:5,000
using napkins, then we have to cut our family milk budget."

127
0:06:51.174,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Why not make myself a low-cost napkin?

128
0:06:55.595,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So I decided I'm going to sell this new machine

129
0:06:58.376,000 --> 0:07:,000
only for Women Self Help Groups.

130
0:07:05.236,000 --> 0:07:08,000
That is my idea.

131
0:07:09.689,000 --> 0:07:13,000
AM: And previously, you need a multimillion investment

132
0:07:14.404,000 --> 0:07:17,000
for machine and all. Now, any rural woman can.

133
0:07:17.904,000 --> 0:07:18,000
They are performing puja.

134
0:07:19.773,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Video): (Singing)

135
0:07:36.787,000 --> 0:07:4,000
You just think, competing giants,

136
0:07:41.373,000 --> 0:07:42,000
even from Harvard, Oxford, is difficult.

137
0:07:43.264,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals.

138
0:07:46.148,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I'm sustaining on seventh year.

139
0:07:47.718,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Already 600 installations. What is my mission?

140
0:07:49.979,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I'm going to make India

141
0:07:51.84,000 --> 0:07:55,000
[into] a 100-percent-sanitary-napkin-using country in my lifetime.

142
0:07:55.844,000 --> 0:07:56,000
In this way I'm going to provide not less than a million

143
0:07:57.829,000 --> 0:07:59,000
rural employment that I'm going to create.

144
0:07:59.887,000 --> 0:08:02,000
That's why I'm not running after this bloody money.

145
0:08:03.443,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I'm doing something serious.

146
0:08:04.943,000 --> 0:08:08,000
If you chase a girl, the girl won't like you.

147
0:08:09.292,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Do your job simply, the girl will chase you.

148
0:08:11.69,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Like that, I never chased Mahalakshmi.

149
0:08:14.041,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Mahalakshmi is chasing me, I am keeping in the back pocket.

150
0:08:18.911,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Not in front pocket. I'm a back pocket man.

151
0:08:23.367,000 --> 0:08:26,000
That's all. A school dropout saw your problem in the society

152
0:08:26.939,000 --> 0:08:28,000
of not using sanitary pad.

153
0:08:28.971,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I am becoming a solution provider. I'm very happy.

154
0:08:31.271,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I don't want to make this as a corporate entity.

155
0:08:34.114,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement

156
0:08:38.117,000 --> 0:08:4,000
across the globe. That's why I put all the details

157
0:08:40.97,000 --> 0:08:43,000
on public domain like an open software.

158
0:08:44.334,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Now 110 countries are accessing it. Okay?

159
0:08:48.896,000 --> 0:08:52,000
So I classify the people into three:

160
0:08:52.896,000 --> 0:08:58,000
uneducated, little educated, surplus educated.

161
0:08:59.818,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Little educated, done this. Surplus educated,

162
0:09:03.709,000 --> 0:09:04,000
what are you going to do for the society?

163
0:09:05.113,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Thank you very much. Bye!

164
0:09:08.88,000 --> 0:09:19,000

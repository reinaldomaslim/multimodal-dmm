1
0:00:12.738,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm a marine biologist and an explorer-photographer

2
0:00:15.922,000 --> 0:00:16,000
with National Geographic,

3
0:00:17.687,000 --> 0:00:18,000
but I want to share a secret.

4
0:00:19.793,000 --> 0:00:22,000
This image is totally incorrect,

5
0:00:23.46,000 --> 0:00:24,000
totally incorrect.

6
0:00:25.221,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I see a couple of people crying in the back

7
0:00:27.372,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that I've blown their idea of mermaids.

8
0:00:29.84,000 --> 0:00:31,000
All right, the mermaid is indeed real,

9
0:00:32.515,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but anyone who's gone on a dive

10
0:00:34.674,000 --> 0:00:36,000
will know that the ocean looks more like this.

11
0:00:37.767,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It's because the ocean is this massive filter,

12
0:00:41.291,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and as soon as you start going underwater,

13
0:00:43.388,000 --> 0:00:44,000
you're going to lose your colors,

14
0:00:45.085,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and it's going to get dark and blue very quickly.

15
0:00:48.315,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But we're humans -- we're terrestrial mammals.

16
0:00:51.124,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And we've got trichromatic vision,

17
0:00:53.323,000 --> 0:00:55,000
so we see in red, green and blue,

18
0:00:56.013,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and we're just complete color addicts.

19
0:00:58.362,000 --> 0:01:,000
We love eye-popping color,

20
0:01:01.029,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and we try to bring this eye-popping color

21
0:01:03.64,000 --> 0:01:04,000
underwater with us.

22
0:01:05.044,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So there's been a long and sordid history of bringing color underwater,

23
0:01:09.105,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and it starts 88 years ago with Bill Longley and Charles Martin,

24
0:01:14.075,000 --> 0:01:16,000
who were trying to take the first underwater color photograph.

25
0:01:17.02,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And they're in there with old-school scuba suits,

26
0:01:19.759,000 --> 0:01:21,000
where you're pumping air down to them,

27
0:01:21.908,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and they've got a pontoon of high-explosive magnesium powder,

28
0:01:27.522,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and the poor people at the surface are not sure

29
0:01:29.753,000 --> 0:01:32,000
when they're going to pull the string when they've got their frame in focus,

30
0:01:33.407,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and -- boom! -- a pound of high explosives would go off

31
0:01:36.355,000 --> 0:01:39,000
so they could put a little bit of light underwater

32
0:01:39.434,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and get an image like this beautiful hogfish.

33
0:01:42.228,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I mean, it's a gorgeous image, but this is not real.

34
0:01:45.101,000 --> 0:01:47,000
They're creating an artificial environment

35
0:01:47.884,000 --> 0:01:5,000
so we can satisfy our own addiction to color.

36
0:01:51.996,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And looking at it the other way, what we've been finding

37
0:01:55.848,000 --> 0:01:58,000
is that instead of bringing color underwater with us,

38
0:01:59.076,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that we've been looking at the blue ocean,

39
0:02:01.852,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and it's a crucible of blue,

40
0:02:04.138,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and these animals living there for millions of years

41
0:02:07.258,000 --> 0:02:11,000
have been evolving all sorts of ways to take in that blue light

42
0:02:11.812,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and give off other colors.

43
0:02:13.527,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And here's just a little sample of what this secret world looks like.

44
0:02:16.837,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It's like an underwater light show.

45
0:02:18.739,000 --> 0:02:22,000
(Music)

46
0:02:23.495,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Again, what we're seeing here is blue light hitting this image.

47
0:02:27.439,000 --> 0:02:29,000
These animals are absorbing the blue light

48
0:02:29.552,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and immediately transforming this light.

49
0:02:35.39,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So if you think about it, the ocean is 71 percent of the planet,

50
0:02:39.787,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and blue light can extend down to almost a 1,000 meters.

51
0:02:43.881,000 --> 0:02:45,000
As we go down underwater,

52
0:02:46.009,000 --> 0:02:48,000
after about 10 meters, all the red is gone.

53
0:02:48.727,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So if you see anything under 10 meters that's red,

54
0:02:51.954,000 --> 0:02:54,000
it's an animal transforming and creating its own red.

55
0:02:55.472,000 --> 0:03:01,000
This is the largest single monochromatic blue environment on our planet.

56
0:03:02.67,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And my gateway into this world of biofluorescence begins with corals.

57
0:03:07.384,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And I want to give a full TED Talk on corals

58
0:03:09.494,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and just how cool these things are.

59
0:03:11.32,000 --> 0:03:14,000
One of the things that they do, one of their miraculous feats,

60
0:03:14.566,000 --> 0:03:16,000
is they produce lots of these fluorescent proteins,

61
0:03:17.368,000 --> 0:03:18,000
fluorescent molecules.

62
0:03:18.877,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And in this coral, it could be making up to 14 percent of its body mass --

63
0:03:23.648,000 --> 0:03:25,000
could be this fluorescent protein.

64
0:03:25.757,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So you wouldn't be making, like, 14 percent muscle and not using it,

65
0:03:30.21,000 --> 0:03:33,000
so it's likely doing something that has a functional role.

66
0:03:33.818,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And for the last 10, 15 years, this was so special to me,

67
0:03:37.679,000 --> 0:03:42,000
because this molecule has turned out to be one of the most revolutionary tools

68
0:03:43.123,000 --> 0:03:44,000
in biomedical science,

69
0:03:44.847,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and it's allowing us to better see inside ourselves.

70
0:03:49.464,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So, how do I study this?

71
0:03:51.829,000 --> 0:03:54,000
In order to study biofluorescence, we swim at night.

72
0:03:54.924,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And when I started out,

73
0:03:56.326,000 --> 0:04:,000
I was just using these blue duct-tape filters over my strobe,

74
0:04:00.361,000 --> 0:04:02,000
so I could make sure I'm actually seeing the light

75
0:04:02.764,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that's being transformed by the animals.

76
0:04:04.82,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We're making an exhibit for the Museum of Natural History,

77
0:04:08.321,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and we're trying to show off how great the fluorescent corals are on the reef,

78
0:04:12.152,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and something happened that just blew me away:

79
0:04:15.232,000 --> 0:04:16,000
this.

80
0:04:16.645,000 --> 0:04:17,000
In the middle of our corals,

81
0:04:18.485,000 --> 0:04:21,000
is this green fluorescent fish.

82
0:04:21.515,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It's the first time we've ever seen a green fluorescent fish

83
0:04:24.351,000 --> 0:04:25,000
or any vertebrate for that matter.

84
0:04:26.002,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And we're rubbing our eyes, checking the filters,

85
0:04:28.581,000 --> 0:04:31,000
thinking that somebody's maybe playing a joke on us with the camera,

86
0:04:31.804,000 --> 0:04:32,000
but the eel was real.

87
0:04:33.771,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It was the first green fluorescent eel that we found,

88
0:04:37.334,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and this just changed my trajectory completely.

89
0:04:40.317,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So I had to put down my corals and team up

90
0:04:43.675,000 --> 0:04:45,000
with a fish scientist, John Sparks,

91
0:04:45.732,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and begin a search around the world

92
0:04:48.255,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to see how prevalent this phenomenon is.

93
0:04:51.53,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And fish are much more interesting than corals,

94
0:04:54.029,000 --> 0:04:56,000
because they have really advanced vision,

95
0:04:56.267,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and some of the fish even have, the way that I was photographing it,

96
0:05:00.076,000 --> 0:05:03,000
they have lenses in their eyes that would magnify the fluorescence.

97
0:05:03.536,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So I wanted to seek this out further.

98
0:05:05.87,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So we designed a new set of gear

99
0:05:07.616,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and we're scouring the reefs around the world,

100
0:05:09.929,000 --> 0:05:1,000
looking for fluorescent life.

101
0:05:11.532,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And it's a bit like "E.T. phone home."

102
0:05:13.611,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We're out there swimming with this blue light,

103
0:05:16.344,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and we're looking for a response,

104
0:05:18.573,000 --> 0:05:21,000
for animals to be absorbing the light and transferring this back to us.

105
0:05:22.172,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And eventually, we found our photobombing Kaupichphys eel.

106
0:05:26.908,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It's a really shy, reclusive eel that we know almost nothing about.

107
0:05:31.402,000 --> 0:05:32,000
They're only about the size of my finger,

108
0:05:33.387,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and they spend about 99.9 percent of their time hidden under a rock.

109
0:05:37.891,000 --> 0:05:41,000
But these eels do come out to mate under full-moon nights,

110
0:05:42.036,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and that full-moon night translates underwater to blue.

111
0:05:45.553,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Perhaps they're using this as a way to see each other,

112
0:05:48.107,000 --> 0:05:49,000
quickly find each other, mate,

113
0:05:49.592,000 --> 0:05:52,000
go back into their hole for the next long stint of time.

114
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But then we started to find other fluorescent marine life,

115
0:05:56.234,000 --> 0:05:58,000
like this green fluorescent bream,

116
0:05:59.055,000 --> 0:06:02,000
with its, like, racing stripes along its head and its nape,

117
0:06:03.064,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and it's almost camouflaged and fluorescing at the same intensity

118
0:06:07.389,000 --> 0:06:08,000
as the fluorescent coral there.

119
0:06:10.19,000 --> 0:06:12,000
After this fish,

120
0:06:12.301,000 --> 0:06:16,000
we were introduced to this red fluorescent scorpionfish

121
0:06:16.626,000 --> 0:06:18,000
cloaked and hidden on this rock.

122
0:06:18.793,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The only time we've ever seen this, it's either on red fluorescent algae

123
0:06:22.618,000 --> 0:06:23,000
or red fluorescent coral.

124
0:06:24.634,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Later, we found this stealthy green fluorescent lizardfish.

125
0:06:29.991,000 --> 0:06:31,000
These lizardfish come in many varieties,

126
0:06:32.103,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and they look almost exactly alike under white light.

127
0:06:35.396,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But if you look at them under fluorescent light,

128
0:06:37.794,000 --> 0:06:38,000
you see lots of patterns,

129
0:06:39.219,000 --> 0:06:41,000
you can really see the differences among them.

130
0:06:41.929,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And in total -- we just reported this last year --

131
0:06:44.89,000 --> 0:06:48,000
we found over 200 species of biofluorescent fish.

132
0:06:50.135,000 --> 0:06:55,000
One of my inspirations is French artist and biologist Jean Painlevé.

133
0:06:56.085,000 --> 0:07:,000
He really captures this entrepreneuring, creative spirit in biology.

134
0:07:00.158,000 --> 0:07:03,000
He would design his own gear, make his own cameras,

135
0:07:03.985,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and he was fascinated with the seahorse, Hippocampus erectus,

136
0:07:08.003,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and he filmed for the first time the seahorse giving birth.

137
0:07:12.086,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So this is the male seahorse.

138
0:07:13.662,000 --> 0:07:17,000
They were one of the first fish to start swimming upright

139
0:07:18.4,000 --> 0:07:19,000
with their brain above their head.

140
0:07:20.052,000 --> 0:07:21,000
The males give birth,

141
0:07:21.227,000 --> 0:07:22,000
just phenomenal creatures.

142
0:07:24.955,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So he stayed awake for days.

143
0:07:26.321,000 --> 0:07:29,000
He even put this electrical visor on his head that would shock him,

144
0:07:29.52,000 --> 0:07:3,000
so he could capture this moment.

145
0:07:32.796,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Now, I wish I could have shown Painlevé

146
0:07:34.94,000 --> 0:07:37,000
the moment where we found biofluorescent seahorses

147
0:07:38.061,000 --> 0:07:4,000
in the exact same species that he was studying.

148
0:07:40.784,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And here's our footage.

149
0:07:42.022,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Music)

150
0:07:46.476,000 --> 0:07:47,000
They're the most cryptic fish.

151
0:07:47.967,000 --> 0:07:5,000
You could be swimming right on top of them and not see the seahorse.

152
0:07:52.228,000 --> 0:07:56,000
They would blend right into the algae, which would also fluoresce red,

153
0:07:56.76,000 --> 0:07:57,000
but they've got great vision,

154
0:07:58.245,000 --> 0:08:,000
and they go through this long mating ritual,

155
0:08:00.443,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and perhaps they're using it in that effect.

156
0:08:03.647,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But things got pretty edgy

157
0:08:07.442,000 --> 0:08:12,000
when we found green fluorescence in the stingray,

158
0:08:12.479,000 --> 0:08:14,000
because stingrays are in the Elasmobranch class,

159
0:08:15.267,000 --> 0:08:16,000
which includes ...

160
0:08:17.075,000 --> 0:08:18,000
sharks.

161
0:08:18.558,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So I'm, like, a coral biologist.

162
0:08:22.161,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Somebody's got to go down and check to see if the sharks are fluorescent.

163
0:08:25.63,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And there I am.

164
0:08:26.916,000 --> 0:08:27,000
(Laughter)

165
0:08:28.338,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And I was like, "Maybe I should go back to corals."

166
0:08:30.901,000 --> 0:08:31,000
(Laughter)

167
0:08:31.957,000 --> 0:08:33,000
It turns out that these sharks are not fluorescent.

168
0:08:35.473,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And then we found it.

169
0:08:36.913,000 --> 0:08:4,000
In a deep, dark canyon off the coast of California,

170
0:08:41.775,000 --> 0:08:45,000
we found the first biofluorescent swellshark,

171
0:08:46.236,000 --> 0:08:47,000
right underneath all the surfers.

172
0:08:48.035,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Here it is.

173
0:08:49.244,000 --> 0:08:51,000
They're just about a meter long. It's called a swellshark.

174
0:08:51.992,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And they call them a swellshark because if they're threatened,

175
0:08:54.928,000 --> 0:08:56,000
they can gulp down water and blow up like an inner tube,

176
0:08:57.698,000 --> 0:08:58,000
about twice their size,

177
0:08:58.881,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and wedge themselves under a rock, so they don't get eaten by a predator.

178
0:09:04.158,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And here is our first footage of these biofluorescent swellsharks.

179
0:09:09.229,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Just magnificent -- I mean, they're showing these distinct patterns,

180
0:09:13.974,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and there are areas that are fluorescent and areas that are not fluorescent,

181
0:09:17.571,000 --> 0:09:19,000
but they've also got these twinkling spots on them

182
0:09:20.184,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that are much brighter than other parts of the shark.

183
0:09:22.799,000 --> 0:09:24,000
But this is all beautiful to see.

184
0:09:25.35,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I was like, this is gorgeous.

185
0:09:27.004,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But what does it mean to the shark?

186
0:09:29.859,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Can they see this?

187
0:09:31.23,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And we looked in the literature,

188
0:09:32.786,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and nothing was known about this shark's vision.

189
0:09:35.968,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So I took this shark to eye specialist Ellis Loew at Cornell University,

190
0:09:40.174,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and we found out that this shark sees discretely and acutely

191
0:09:43.721,000 --> 0:09:45,000
in the blue-green interface,

192
0:09:45.839,000 --> 0:09:47,000
probably about 100 times better than we can see in the dark,

193
0:09:48.693,000 --> 0:09:49,000
but they only see blue-green.

194
0:09:50.443,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So what it's doing is taking this blue world

195
0:09:53.586,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and it's absorbing the blue, creating green.

196
0:09:56.363,000 --> 0:09:58,000
It's creating contrast that they can indeed see.

197
0:09:59.205,000 --> 0:10:,000
So we have a model,

198
0:10:00.38,000 --> 0:10:03,000
showing that it creates an ability for them to see all these patterns.

199
0:10:03.776,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And males and females also have, we're finding,

200
0:10:06.681,000 --> 0:10:07,000
distinct patterns among them.

201
0:10:09.276,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But our last find came really just a few miles from where we are now,

202
0:10:14.733,000 --> 0:10:15,000
in the Solomon Islands.

203
0:10:16.208,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Swimming at night, I encountered the first biofluorescent sea turtle.

204
0:10:20.692,000 --> 0:10:23,000
So now it's going from fish and sharks into reptiles,

205
0:10:24.128,000 --> 0:10:27,000
which, again, this is only one month old,

206
0:10:27.436,000 --> 0:10:29,000
but it shows us that we know almost nothing

207
0:10:29.838,000 --> 0:10:31,000
about this hawksbill turtle's vision.

208
0:10:32.136,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And it makes me think about how much more there is to learn.

209
0:10:35.016,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And here in the Solomon Islands,

210
0:10:36.572,000 --> 0:10:39,000
there's only a few thousand breeding females of this species left,

211
0:10:40.167,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and this is one of the hotspots for them.

212
0:10:42.235,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So it shows us how much we need to really protect these animals

213
0:10:45.326,000 --> 0:10:47,000
while they're still here, and understand them.

214
0:10:47.706,000 --> 0:10:49,000
In thinking about biofluorescence,

215
0:10:49.874,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I wanted to know, how deep does it go?

216
0:10:51.843,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Does this go all the way to the bottom of the ocean?

217
0:10:54.311,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So we started using submarines, and we equipped them

218
0:10:57.882,000 --> 0:10:59,000
with special blue lights on the front here.

219
0:11:00.08,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And we dropped down,

220
0:11:02.064,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and we noticed one important thing --

221
0:11:04.805,000 --> 0:11:07,000
that as we get down to 1,000 meters,

222
0:11:08.127,000 --> 0:11:09,000
it drops off.

223
0:11:09.467,000 --> 0:11:12,000
There's no biofluorescent marine life down there, below 1,000 meters --

224
0:11:13.395,000 --> 0:11:15,000
almost nothing, it's just darkness.

225
0:11:15.424,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So it's mainly a shallow phenomenon.

226
0:11:17.878,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And below 1,000 meters,

227
0:11:19.355,000 --> 0:11:21,000
we encountered the bioluminescent zone,

228
0:11:22.04,000 --> 0:11:25,000
where nine out of 10 animals are actually making their own lights

229
0:11:25.401,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and flashing and blinking.

230
0:11:27.179,000 --> 0:11:28,000
As I try to get deeper,

231
0:11:28.576,000 --> 0:11:3,000
this is slapping on a one-person submarine suit --

232
0:11:31.575,000 --> 0:11:34,000
some people call this my "Jacques Cousteau meets Woody Allen" moment.

233
0:11:35.362,000 --> 0:11:36,000
(Laughter)

234
0:11:36.537,000 --> 0:11:38,000
But as we explore down here,

235
0:11:38.612,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I was thinking about: How do we interact with life delicately?

236
0:11:42.355,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Because we're entering a new age of exploration,

237
0:11:45.076,000 --> 0:11:46,000
where we have to take great care,

238
0:11:46.903,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and we have to set examples how we explore.

239
0:11:49.622,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood at Harvard University,

240
0:11:53.31,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and we've been designing squishy underwater robot fingers,

241
0:11:58.36,000 --> 0:12:01,000
so we can delicately interact with the marine life down there.

242
0:12:01.486,000 --> 0:12:05,000
The idea is that most of our technologies to explore the deep ocean

243
0:12:06.225,000 --> 0:12:08,000
come from oil and gas and military,

244
0:12:09.029,000 --> 0:12:11,000
who, you know, they're not really caring to be gentle.

245
0:12:11.894,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Some corals could be 1,000 years old.

246
0:12:14.601,000 --> 0:12:17,000
You don't want to just go and crush them with a big claw.

247
0:12:17.734,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So my dream is something like this.

248
0:12:19.756,000 --> 0:12:21,000
At night, I'm in a submarine,

249
0:12:22.076,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I have force-feedback gloves,

250
0:12:24.21,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and I could delicately set up a lab in the front of my submarine,

251
0:12:27.552,000 --> 0:12:29,000
where the squishy robot fingers

252
0:12:30.115,000 --> 0:12:32,000
are delicately collecting and putting things in jars,

253
0:12:32.624,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and we can conduct our research.

254
0:12:34.607,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Back to the powerful applied applications.

255
0:12:37.481,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Here, you're looking at a living brain

256
0:12:40.345,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that's using the DNA of fluorescent marine creatures,

257
0:12:43.736,000 --> 0:12:45,000
this one from jellyfish and corals,

258
0:12:45.766,000 --> 0:12:48,000
to illuminate the living brain and see its connections.

259
0:12:49.259,000 --> 0:12:5,000
It's funny that we're using RGB

260
0:12:50.799,000 --> 0:12:52,000
just to kind of satisfy our own human intuition,

261
0:12:53.371,000 --> 0:12:55,000
so we can see our brains better.

262
0:12:55.729,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And even more mind-blowing,

263
0:12:57.801,000 --> 0:13:,000
is my close colleague Vincent Pieribone at Yale,

264
0:13:00.935,000 --> 0:13:03,000
who has actually designed and engineered a fluorescent protein

265
0:13:04.336,000 --> 0:13:06,000
that responds to voltage.

266
0:13:06.455,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So he could see when a single neuron fires.

267
0:13:09.581,000 --> 0:13:13,000
You're essentially looking at a portal into consciousness

268
0:13:14.144,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that was designed by marine creatures.

269
0:13:18.102,000 --> 0:13:22,000
So this brings me all back to perspective and relationship.

270
0:13:22.812,000 --> 0:13:24,000
From deep space,

271
0:13:25.075,000 --> 0:13:28,000
our universe looks like a human brain cell,

272
0:13:28.251,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and then here we are in the deep ocean,

273
0:13:30.757,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and we're finding marine creatures and cells

274
0:13:33.652,000 --> 0:13:35,000
that can illuminate the human mind.

275
0:13:35.955,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And it's my hope that with illuminated minds,

276
0:13:39.097,000 --> 0:13:42,000
we could ponder the overarching interconnectedness of all life,

277
0:13:42.906,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and fathom how much more lies in store

278
0:13:45.288,000 --> 0:13:46,000
if we keep our oceans healthy.

279
0:13:47.027,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Thank you.

280
0:13:48.209,000 --> 0:13:53,000
(Applause)

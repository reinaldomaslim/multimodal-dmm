1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Please close your eyes,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and open your hands.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Now imagine what you could place in your hands:

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
an apple, maybe your wallet.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Now open your eyes.

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
What about a life?

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
What you see here is a premature baby.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
He looks like he's resting peacefully, but in fact he's struggling to stay alive

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
because he can't regulate his own body temperature.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
This baby is so tiny he doesn't have

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
enough fat on his body to stay warm.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Sadly, 20 million babies like this

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
are born every year around the world.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Four million of these babies die annually.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
grow up with severe, long-term health problems.

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
The reason is because in the first month of a baby's life,

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
its only job is to grow.

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
If it's battling hypothermia, its organs can't develop normally,

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
resulting in a range of health problems

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
from diabetes, to heart disease,

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to low I.Q.

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Imagine: Many of these problems could be prevented

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
if these babies were just kept warm.

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
That is the primary function of an incubator.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But traditional incubators require electricity

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and cost up to 20 thousand dollars.

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So, you're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries.

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
As a result, parents resort to local solutions

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
like tying hot water bottles around their babies' bodies,

31
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here --

32
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
methods that are both ineffective and unsafe.

33
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I've seen this firsthand over and over again.

34
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
On one of my first trips to India, I met this young woman, Sevitha,

35
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby, Rani.

36
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
She took her baby to the nearest village clinic,

37
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and the doctor advised her to take Rani

38
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator.

39
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But that hospital was over four hours away,

40
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and Sevitha didn't have the means to get there,

41
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
so her baby died.

42
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Inspired by this story, and dozens of other similar stories like this,

43
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
my team and I realized what was needed was a local solution,

44
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
something that could work without electricity,

45
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use,

46
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
given that the majority of births still take place in the home.

47
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We needed something that was portable,

48
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies

49
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and something ultra-low-cost,

50
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
compared to the 20,000 dollars

51
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that an incubator in the U.S. costs.

52
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So, this is what we came up with.

53
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
What you see here looks nothing like an incubator.

54
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby.

55
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
You can open it up completely. It's waterproof.

56
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
There's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily.

57
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But the magic is in this pouch of wax.

58
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
This is a phase-change material.

59
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It's a wax-like substance with a melting point

60
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
of human body temperature, 37 degrees Celsius.

61
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
You can melt this simply using hot water

62
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and then when it melts it's able to maintain one constant temperature

63
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
for four to six hours at a time,

64
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
after which you simply reheat the pouch.

65
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So, you then place it into this little pocket back here,

66
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and it creates a warm micro-environment

67
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
for the baby.

68
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Looks simple, but we've reiterated this dozens of times

69
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
by going into the field to talk to doctors, moms and clinicians

70
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities.

71
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
We plan to launch this product in India in 2010,

72
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and the target price point will be 25 dollars,

73
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
less than 0.1 percent of the cost

74
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
of a traditional incubator.

75
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Over the next five years we hope to save the lives

76
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
of almost a million babies.

77
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
But the longer-term social impact is a reduction in population growth.

78
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
This seems counterintuitive,

79
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
but turns out that as infant mortality is reduced,

80
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
population sizes also decrease,

81
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
because parents don't need to anticipate

82
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
that their babies are going to die.

83
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
We hope that the Embrace infant warmer

84
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and other simple innovations like this

85
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
represent a new trend for the future of technology:

86
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
simple, localized, affordable solutions

87
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that have the potential to make huge social impact.

88
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
In designing this we followed a few basic principles.

89
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
We really tried to understand the end user,

90
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
in this case, people like Sevitha.

91
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
We tried to understand the root of the problem

92
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
rather than being biased by what already exists.

93
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And then we thought of the most simple solution we could

94
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to address this problem.

95
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
In doing this, I believe we can truly bring technology to the masses.

96
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Embrace.

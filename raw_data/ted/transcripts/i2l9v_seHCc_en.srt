0:00:13.44,000 --> 0:00:14,000
A few years ago,

3
0:00:15.32,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I got a call from the highest ranking legal official in the state of Georgia:

4
0:00:19.84,000 --> 0:00:2,000
the attorney general.

5
0:00:21.72,000 --> 0:00:23,000
That moment was a wake-up call.

6
0:00:25.6,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It was 2013, and the city of Atlanta

7
0:00:28.36,000 --> 0:00:31,000
was hosting the Final Four basketball tournament.

8
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
The AG called to ask

9
0:00:33.68,000 --> 0:00:36,000
if the company that I worked for could help sponsor billboards

10
0:00:37.24,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that would be put up around the city

11
0:00:39.2,000 --> 0:00:41,000
as part of an anti-human trafficking campaign.

12
0:00:42.8,000 --> 0:00:46,000
He said this was important because sex trafficking spikes

13
0:00:47.28,000 --> 0:00:51,000
with big sporting events and with conventions.

14
0:00:51.56,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And the billboards would help to raise awareness.

15
0:00:55.04,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Now, if I'm being honest with you,

16
0:00:57.12,000 --> 0:01:,000
my first inclination was to politely decline.

17
0:01:00.64,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:01.68,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Let's face it --

19
0:01:02.96,000 --> 0:01:06,000
there are thousands of things that corporate America could get involved in.

20
0:01:07.08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Sex trafficking seemed a little messy.

21
0:01:11.28,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Little bit too difficult,

22
0:01:13.28,000 --> 0:01:15,000
something that is better left for someone else.

23
0:01:16.4,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But then I started to understand and learn how big the problem really is.

24
0:01:22.52,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And that it's rampant in my company's home town.

25
0:01:27.2,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I lived and worked in Atlanta for years.

26
0:01:29.92,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I practice law here.

27
0:01:31.36,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And yet, I had no idea that the birthplace of my children

28
0:01:35.56,000 --> 0:01:39,000
is among the most prevalent cities for sex trafficking in the US.

29
0:01:40.52,000 --> 0:01:43,000
At last report, Atlanta's illegal sex trade

30
0:01:44.28,000 --> 0:01:49,000
has generated up to 290 million dollars a year.

31
0:01:50.4,000 --> 0:01:54,000
That's more money that the city's illegal gun and drug trade combined.

32
0:01:56.12,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So we stepped up and we helped with the billboards.

33
0:01:59.56,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But I couldn't help feeling like it wasn't enough.

34
0:02:02.28,000 --> 0:02:06,000
The parent in me, the mother in me needed to do more.

35
0:02:07.68,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I started talking to people about this

36
0:02:09.68,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and inevitably, I was surprised,

37
0:02:11.56,000 --> 0:02:14,000
because the conversation would turn from curiosity:

38
0:02:15.24,000 --> 0:02:17,000
"Really? This happens here?"

39
0:02:18.04,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to empathy: "Wow, we've got to do something about that."

40
0:02:22.199,000 --> 0:02:27,000
To blame: "You're not telling me that every prostitute is a victim, are you?

41
0:02:27.64,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I mean, don't they know what they're getting into?"

42
0:02:30.64,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I get it, I understand why people are confused.

43
0:02:33.2,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So, to be clear, the people that I'm talking about

44
0:02:36.64,000 --> 0:02:38,000
do not choose this life.

45
0:02:39.48,000 --> 0:02:42,000
They're forced, defrauded or coerced.

46
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
That's actually the legal definition

47
0:02:45.32,000 --> 0:02:48,000
for human trafficking under federal law, for adults.

48
0:02:48.92,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Now, when it comes to kids,

49
0:02:51.08,000 --> 0:02:55,000
any minor under 18 that's transported,

50
0:02:55.8,000 --> 0:02:58,000
facilitated or used for commercial sex,

51
0:02:58.96,000 --> 0:02:59,000
is automatically a victim.

52
0:03:00.92,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Regardless of whether force, fraud or coercion is used.

53
0:03:05.88,000 --> 0:03:11,000
This crime knows no age, gender or socioeconomic barrier.

54
0:03:12.08,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I'm talking about the 16-year-old girl that I met in Washington, DC.

55
0:03:16.44,000 --> 0:03:2,000
She had been trafficked from the time she was 14 until she was 16.

56
0:03:21.36,000 --> 0:03:24,000
She was a victim of the foster care system.

57
0:03:24.68,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And she told me she'd been sold up to five times a day.

58
0:03:30.24,000 --> 0:03:32,000
She didn't even know the term "human trafficking;"

59
0:03:32.64,000 --> 0:03:35,000
she thought that it was just a part of her life as a foster care kid.

60
0:03:37.88,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Sex trafficking also shows up in affluent areas and gated communities.

61
0:03:42.28,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And men lure young girls into sex trafficking situations

62
0:03:47.64,000 --> 0:03:51,000
with promises of modeling contracts, cell phones.

63
0:03:51.68,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Sometimes they're just kidnapped right off the street.

64
0:03:55.68,000 --> 0:04:01,000
In the US, an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 girls and boys

65
0:04:02.68,000 --> 0:04:07,000
are anticipated to be used for commercial sex trafficking every year.

66
0:04:08.68,000 --> 0:04:11,000
You heard that right -- girls and boys.

67
0:04:12.64,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Worldwide, the International Labor Organization

68
0:04:16.32,000 --> 0:04:19,000
estimates that up to one million children a year

69
0:04:19.76,000 --> 0:04:2,000
are vulnerable for sex trafficking.

70
0:04:21.52,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Those numbers are huge.

71
0:04:23.84,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And so while the billboards are great for raising awareness generally,

72
0:04:28.519,000 --> 0:04:31,000
they're just not enough to put an end to this problem.

73
0:04:32.04,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I believe that if we're going to be serious about sex trafficking,

74
0:04:36.48,000 --> 0:04:41,000
we can't legislate or arrest our way out of modern-day slavery.

75
0:04:41.92,000 --> 0:04:44,000
If we really want to end sex trafficking in the US,

76
0:04:45.24,000 --> 0:04:49,000
we have to systematically educate and target demand.

77
0:04:49.76,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And I think the business community is in the perfect position

78
0:04:52.88,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to do just that.

79
0:04:55.64,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So, sex trafficking is big business.

80
0:04:57.92,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And I'm proposing a business plan that starts with the customer.

81
0:05:03.8,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And in the sex trade, the customer is referred to as a John.

82
0:05:08.88,000 --> 0:05:12,000
He is the man that fuels the demand for sex trafficking.

83
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Johns do not fit into neat stereotypes.

84
0:05:18.56,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But there is one universal truth:

85
0:05:21.2,000 --> 0:05:24,000
no John, no buyer, no victim.

86
0:05:25.84,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So if we want to start to put a dent in sex trafficking,

87
0:05:28.52,000 --> 0:05:29,000
we have to get to John.

88
0:05:29.92,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And businesses can do that while he's at work.

89
0:05:34.68,000 --> 0:05:38,000
There's an organization called Businesses Ending Slavery and Trafficking,

90
0:05:39.04,000 --> 0:05:4,000
or BEST for short.

91
0:05:40.8,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And when they launched in 2012,

92
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
they did a study of Seattle-based Johns.

93
0:05:46.32,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And you know what they found out?

94
0:05:48.68,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Johns are everyday guys, employed at local businesses.

95
0:05:54.88,000 --> 0:05:58,000
They range in age from 18 to 84.

96
0:05:59.92,000 --> 0:06:,000
Johns are dads.

97
0:06:02.64,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Johns have admitted that they buy sex when they are traveling for business,

98
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
when they're going to sporting events

99
0:06:09.64,000 --> 0:06:1,000
or when they're in the military.

100
0:06:12.12,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But here's the kicker.

101
0:06:15.36,000 --> 0:06:19,000
BEST study determined that web-based sex buying

102
0:06:20.08,000 --> 0:06:23,000
spikes at 2pm in the afternoon.

103
0:06:26.12,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Which means that these Johns are likely buying sex in the middle of the workday.

104
0:06:32.72,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I believe that there is a way to stop Johns in the middle of the workday

105
0:06:39.64,000 --> 0:06:4,000
from buying sex.

106
0:06:41.28,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And businesses can do it in three simple ways.

107
0:06:44.44,000 --> 0:06:46,000
The first is with a policy.

108
0:06:47.08,000 --> 0:06:49,000
A policy that clearly says,

109
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
the company prohibits sex-buying during work,

110
0:06:53.44,000 --> 0:06:56,000
with company resources or on company time.

111
0:06:57.96,000 --> 0:06:58,000
That's right.

112
0:06:59.2,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I'm saying that your handbook has to specifically give an example

113
0:07:02.32,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that says no sex-buying while you're traveling,

114
0:07:04.68,000 --> 0:07:08,000
at the international trade show, because that's where it's happening.

115
0:07:11.88,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Now, a policy is only as good as its enforcement and its communication.

116
0:07:17,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Several studies have indicated from Johns

117
0:07:19.6,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that the best way to deter them is public humiliation and embarrassment.

118
0:07:25.96,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So, businesses who catch Johns buying sex,

119
0:07:29.76,000 --> 0:07:32,000
using company-based equipment or company resources,

120
0:07:33.56,000 --> 0:07:35,000
but cut them a break or sweep it under the rug

121
0:07:35.84,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and don't fire them,

122
0:07:37.68,000 --> 0:07:39,000
are complicit in fueling demand.

123
0:07:45.4,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Now, a policy is one of the best ways to start.

124
0:07:48.28,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The second way is educating the workforce.

125
0:07:51.84,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Businesses can go a long way in simply training their workforce

126
0:07:55.6,000 --> 0:07:58,000
about the signs and the red flags of human trafficking.

127
0:07:59.08,000 --> 0:08:03,000
This was my "aha!" moment for how our company could make a big difference.

128
0:08:03.44,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Our nation's highways, airports and truck stops

129
0:08:07.84,000 --> 0:08:1,000
are literally used as modern-day slave routes.

130
0:08:12.12,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Our company has more than 100,000 drivers

131
0:08:16.24,000 --> 0:08:19,000
all over the country, all over the world.

132
0:08:19.28,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And so it made perfect sense to train them to see the red flags.

133
0:08:23.44,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We don't want them jumping out there and doing things on their own,

134
0:08:26.88,000 --> 0:08:29,000
so we want them to call a phone number, the hotline,

135
0:08:30.12,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and let law enforcement intervene.

136
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So to do this, we teamed up

137
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
with an organization called Truckers Against Trafficking.

138
0:08:39.68,000 --> 0:08:44,000
This Colorado-based organization had web-based support and materials

139
0:08:45.2,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that we gave to our truck drivers

140
0:08:47.36,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that gave them exactly what they needed to spot the red flags.

141
0:08:51.48,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Like, hearing CB chatter on their radios about girls at nearby exits.

142
0:08:58.24,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Or, seeing underaged women emerging from vehicles

143
0:09:02.48,000 --> 0:09:04,000
in the truck stop parking lots.

144
0:09:05.52,000 --> 0:09:07,000
When we rolled out this training,

145
0:09:07.6,000 --> 0:09:1,000
a few brave drivers admitted they had seen these women,

146
0:09:11.6,000 --> 0:09:17,000
knocking on the cabs in the truck stops, looking for customers.

147
0:09:17.68,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Now, they said that they weren't buying.

148
0:09:19.8,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But they also didn't know enough to make a call.

149
0:09:24.24,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And that's what we want them to do.

150
0:09:27.96,000 --> 0:09:29,000
TAT's organization -- Truckers Against Trafficking --

151
0:09:30.8,000 --> 0:09:34,000
also emphasizes the need for men to talk to other men

152
0:09:35.56,000 --> 0:09:38,000
about web-based sex buying and not buying commercial sex.

153
0:09:39.36,000 --> 0:09:43,000
They feature men in uniform, proudly proclaiming why they don't buy.

154
0:09:44.12,000 --> 0:09:48,000
If we're going to see a cultural shift in this atrocity,

155
0:09:48.96,000 --> 0:09:5,000
we need men talking to other men

156
0:09:51.56,000 --> 0:09:53,000
about the underlying issues fueling demand.

157
0:09:54.04,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Because sometimes, Johns don't even know

158
0:09:56.44,000 --> 0:09:59,000
that they're purchasing girls who are enslaved.

159
0:10:00.92,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Which brings me to my final way that businesses can help.

160
0:10:04.24,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Every business has a special resource

161
0:10:06.68,000 --> 0:10:1,000
or a secret sauce or resource that they can bring

162
0:10:10.88,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to fight human trafficking.

163
0:10:13.24,000 --> 0:10:16,000
For example, Visa, Master Card and American Express

164
0:10:16.96,000 --> 0:10:19,000
refuse to process transactions from backpage.com,

165
0:10:20.76,000 --> 0:10:23,000
an online sex site that sold commercial sex

166
0:10:24.44,000 --> 0:10:27,000
to the tune of nine million dollars a month.

167
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:34,000
In April of 2018, backpage.com and affiliated websites were shut down,

168
0:10:34.64,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and the FBI seized all their assets.

169
0:10:37.56,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Hiring survivors is another way that any company can help.

170
0:10:42.56,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Randstad, an organization that works with companies

171
0:10:45.52,000 --> 0:10:48,000
to find survivors who need good jobs,

172
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:51,000
has an excellent program, called Hire Hope.

173
0:10:51.56,000 --> 0:10:54,000
We've used this program; we know that it works.

174
0:10:55.24,000 --> 0:10:57,000
In addition to training their flight attendants

175
0:10:57.48,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and their airline crew,

176
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Delta Air Lines also offers SkyMiles, through a program called SkyWish,

177
0:11:03.96,000 --> 0:11:06,000
to survivors to help them escape their traffickers

178
0:11:07.56,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and reunite with their families.

179
0:11:10.4,000 --> 0:11:12,000
There are thousands of things that businesses can do.

180
0:11:13.04,000 --> 0:11:16,000
They just have to decide what to do to join the fight.

181
0:11:18.8,000 --> 0:11:2,000
No one can justify slavery today.

182
0:11:21.32,000 --> 0:11:27,000
But I believe it remains one of the greatest civil rights atrocities

183
0:11:27.36,000 --> 0:11:28,000
of our time.

184
0:11:29.56,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Fortunately, the business community is uniquely positioned

185
0:11:33.68,000 --> 0:11:36,000
to help train their employees,

186
0:11:37.76,000 --> 0:11:39,000
to enforce policies

187
0:11:40.24,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and to help use their special resources

188
0:11:44.08,000 --> 0:11:45,000
to fight human trafficking.

189
0:11:47.36,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And what about you?

190
0:11:49.32,000 --> 0:11:52,000
What if you decided to learn the red flags?

191
0:11:53.04,000 --> 0:11:56,000
What if you decided to look at the signs that are all around you

192
0:11:56.64,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and make a call?

193
0:11:58.52,000 --> 0:12:01,000
There is no penalty for calling law enforcement

194
0:12:01.68,000 --> 0:12:04,000
when you see something that doesn't sit right.

195
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Together, we can all protect our children,

196
0:12:11.56,000 --> 0:12:14,000
we can educate the workforces around us

197
0:12:14.76,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and improve society,

198
0:12:16.64,000 --> 0:12:21,000
where we all live and work with John.

199
0:12:23.8,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Thank you.

200
0:12:25.04,000 --> 0:12:28,000
(Applause)

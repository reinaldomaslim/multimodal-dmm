1
0:00:12.73,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm an astronaut.

2
0:00:14.659,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I flew on the space shuttle twice,

3
0:00:16.944,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and I lived on the International Space Station for almost six months.

4
0:00:21.295,000 --> 0:00:26,000
People often ask me the same question, which is, "What's it like in space?"

5
0:00:27.056,000 --> 0:00:28,000
as if it was a secret.

6
0:00:28.859,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Space belongs to all of us,

7
0:00:31.14,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and I'd like to help you understand why it's a place that is magic for all of us.

8
0:00:38.402,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The day after my 50th birthday,

9
0:00:41.666,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I climbed aboard a Russian capsule,

10
0:00:45.188,000 --> 0:00:46,000
in Russia,

11
0:00:46.585,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and launched into space.

12
0:00:49.11,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Launching is the most dangerous thing that we do,

13
0:00:52.53,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and it's also the most thrilling.

14
0:00:55.214,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Three, two, one ... liftoff!

15
0:00:58.825,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I felt every single bit of the controlled fury of those rocket engines

16
0:01:04.011,000 --> 0:01:06,000
as they blasted us off the Earth.

17
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
We went faster and faster and faster,

18
0:01:10.196,000 --> 0:01:15,000
until, after eight and a half minutes, on purpose, those engines stop --

19
0:01:15.979,000 --> 0:01:16,000
kabunk! --

20
0:01:17.228,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and we are weightless.

21
0:01:19.41,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And the mission and the magic begin.

22
0:01:23.174,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Dmitry and Paolo and I are circling the Earth

23
0:01:26.54,000 --> 0:01:27,000
in our tiny spacecraft,

24
0:01:28.389,000 --> 0:01:3,000
approaching the space station carefully.

25
0:01:31.309,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It's an intricate dance at 17,500 miles an hour

26
0:01:35.671,000 --> 0:01:38,000
between our capsule, the size of a Smart Car,

27
0:01:39.451,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and the space station, the size of a football field.

28
0:01:42.862,000 --> 0:01:48,000
We arrive when those two craft dock with a gentle thunk.

29
0:01:50.405,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We open the hatches,

30
0:01:52.62,000 --> 0:01:55,000
have sloppy zero-G hugs with each other,

31
0:01:56.138,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and now we're six.

32
0:01:58.391,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We're a space family, an instant family.

33
0:02:02.618,000 --> 0:02:05,000
My favorite part about living up there

34
0:02:05.935,000 --> 0:02:06,000
was the flying.

35
0:02:08.266,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I loved it.

36
0:02:09.444,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It was like being Peter Pan.

37
0:02:11.198,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It's not about floating.

38
0:02:12.622,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Just the touch of a finger

39
0:02:14.582,000 --> 0:02:17,000
can actually push you across the entire space station,

40
0:02:18.381,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and then you sort of tuck in with your toes.

41
0:02:21.146,000 --> 0:02:25,000
One of my favorite things was drifting silently

42
0:02:25.355,000 --> 0:02:26,000
through the space station,

43
0:02:26.769,000 --> 0:02:28,000
which was humming along at night.

44
0:02:28.938,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I wondered sometimes if it knew I was there,

45
0:02:32.471,000 --> 0:02:33,000
just silent.

46
0:02:34.059,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But sharing the wonder of that with the crew

47
0:02:37.603,000 --> 0:02:4,000
was also part of what was important to me.

48
0:02:42.394,000 --> 0:02:47,000
A typical day in space starts with the perfect commute.

49
0:02:48.301,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I wake up, cruise down the lab

50
0:02:51.448,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and say hello to the best morning view ever.

51
0:02:55.88,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It's a really fast commute, only 30 seconds,

52
0:03:00.549,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and we never get tired of looking out that window.

53
0:03:03.062,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I think it reminds us that we're actually still very close to Earth.

54
0:03:08.426,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Our crew was the second ever to use the Canadian robotic arm

55
0:03:12.128,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to capture a supply ship the size of a school bus

56
0:03:15.745,000 --> 0:03:17,000
containing about a dozen different experiments

57
0:03:18.493,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and the only chocolate that we would see for the next four months.

58
0:03:22.518,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Now, chocolate aside, every single one of those experiments

59
0:03:25.576,000 --> 0:03:29,000
enables yet one more scientific question answered

60
0:03:29.853,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that we can't do down here on Earth.

61
0:03:33.11,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And so, it's like a different lens,

62
0:03:35.492,000 --> 0:03:38,000
allowing us to see the answers to questions like,

63
0:03:38.524,000 --> 0:03:39,000
"What about combustion?"

64
0:03:39.76,000 --> 0:03:41,000
"What about fluid dynamics?"

65
0:03:42.633,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Now, sleeping is delightful.

66
0:03:45.256,000 --> 0:03:48,000
My favorite -- I mean, you could be upside down, right side up --

67
0:03:48.388,000 --> 0:03:5,000
my favorite: curled up in a little ball and floating freely.

68
0:03:52.066,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Laundry? Nope.

69
0:03:54.359,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We load our dirty clothes into an empty supply ship

70
0:03:58.011,000 --> 0:04:,000
and send it off into space.

71
0:04:00.3,000 --> 0:04:01,000
The bathroom.

72
0:04:01.495,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Everyone wants to know.

73
0:04:02.911,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It's hard to understand, so I made a little video,

74
0:04:05.659,000 --> 0:04:07,000
because I wanted kids to understand

75
0:04:08.143,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that the principle of vacuum saves the day

76
0:04:11.064,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and that just a gentle breeze helps everything go

77
0:04:14.167,000 --> 0:04:16,000
where it is supposed to.

78
0:04:16.404,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Well, in real life it does.

79
0:04:18.327,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:19.429,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Recycling? Of course.

81
0:04:20.644,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So we take our urine, we store it, we filter it and then we drink it.

82
0:04:25.915,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And it's actually delicious.

83
0:04:27.474,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:28.513,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Sitting around the table,

85
0:04:30.659,000 --> 0:04:32,000
eating food that looks bad but actually tastes pretty good.

86
0:04:33.505,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But it's the gathering around the table that's important,

87
0:04:36.343,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I think both in space and on Earth,

88
0:04:39.643,000 --> 0:04:41,000
because that's what cements a crew together.

89
0:04:43.032,000 --> 0:04:46,000
For me, music was a way to stay connected to the rest of the world.

90
0:04:46.757,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I played a duet between Earth and space

91
0:04:50.019,000 --> 0:04:52,000
with Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull

92
0:04:52.989,000 --> 0:04:55,000
on the 50th anniversary of human spaceflight.

93
0:04:56.644,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Connecting to family was so important.

94
0:04:59.223,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I talked with my family almost every day the whole time I was up there,

95
0:05:03.557,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and I would actually read books to my son as a way for us just to be together.

96
0:05:08.632,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So important.

97
0:05:09.947,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Now, when the space station would go over Massachusetts,

98
0:05:12.617,000 --> 0:05:13,000
my family would run outside,

99
0:05:14.29,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and they would watch the brightest star sailing across the sky.

100
0:05:18.98,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And when I looked down, I couldn't see my house,

101
0:05:21.653,000 --> 0:05:24,000
but it meant a lot to me to know that the people I loved the most

102
0:05:25.6,000 --> 0:05:27,000
were looking up while I was looking down.

103
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So the space station, for me, is the place where mission and magic come together.

104
0:05:34.976,000 --> 0:05:36,000
The mission, the work are vital steps

105
0:05:37.63,000 --> 0:05:39,000
in our quest to go further than our planet

106
0:05:39.88,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and imperative for understanding sustainability here on Earth.

107
0:05:43.975,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I loved being a part of that,

108
0:05:45.717,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and if I could have taken my family with me,

109
0:05:48.517,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I never would have come home.

110
0:05:50.853,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And so my view from the station showed me

111
0:05:54.068,000 --> 0:05:57,000
that we are all from the same place.

112
0:05:57.184,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We all have our roles to play.

113
0:06:00.136,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Because, the Earth is our ship.

114
0:06:03.723,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Space is our home.

115
0:06:07.086,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And we are the crew of Spaceship Earth.

116
0:06:12.687,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Thank you.

117
0:06:13.888,000 --> 0:06:14,000
(Applause)

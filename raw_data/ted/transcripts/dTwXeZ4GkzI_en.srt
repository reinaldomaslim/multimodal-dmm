0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago

2
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
while writing an article for Italian Wired.

3
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I'm writing anything,

4
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but I'd already finished editing the piece,

5
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and I realized that I had never once in my life

6
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
looked up the word "disabled" to see what I'd find.

7
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Let me read you the entry.

8
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
"Disabled, adjective: crippled, helpless, useless, wrecked,

9
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
stalled, maimed, wounded, mangled, lame, mutilated,

10
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
run-down, worn-out, weakened, impotent, castrated, paralyzed, handicapped,

11
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
senile, decrepit, laid-up, done-up, done-for, done-in

12
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
cracked-up, counted-out;

13
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
see also hurt, useless and weak.

14
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Antonyms, healthy, strong, capable."

15
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing,

16
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
it was so ludicrous,

17
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but I'd just gotten past "mangled," and my voice broke,

18
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and I had to stop and collect myself

19
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed.

20
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
You know, of course, this is my raggedy old thesaurus

21
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
so I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date, right?

22
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But, in fact, the print date was the early 1980s,

23
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
when I would have been starting primary school

24
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit

25
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and as related to the other kids and the world around me.

26
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And, needless to say, thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then.

27
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world

28
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that perceived someone like me

29
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them,

30
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
when in fact, today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures

31
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
my life has procured.

32
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So, I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition,

33
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
expecting to find a revision worth noting.

34
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Here's the updated version of this entry.

35
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Unfortunately, it's not much better.

36
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I find the last two words under "Near Antonyms," particularly unsettling:

37
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
"whole" and "wholesome."

38
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So, it's not just about the words.

39
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It's what we believe about people when we name them with these words.

40
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It's about the values behind the words, and how we construct those values.

41
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world

42
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and how we view other people.

43
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
In fact, many ancient societies, including the Greeks and the Romans,

44
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful,

45
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence.

46
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So, what reality do we want to call into existence:

47
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
a person who is limited, or a person who's empowered?

48
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
By casually doing something as simple as naming a person, a child,

49
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power.

50
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead?

51
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor

52
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
at the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware.

53
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
His name was Dr. Pizzutillo,

54
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
an Italian American, whose name, apparently,

55
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce,

56
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
so he went by Dr. P.

57
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties

58
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and had the very perfect disposition to work with children.

59
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital,

60
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
with the exception of my physical therapy sessions.

61
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises

62
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
with these thick, elastic bands -- different colors,

63
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
you know -- to help build up my leg muscles,

64
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and I hated these bands more than anything --

65
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I hated them, had names for them. I hated them.

66
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
And, you know, I was already bargaining, as a five year-old child,

67
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises,

68
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
unsuccessfully, of course.

69
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And, one day, he came in to my session --

70
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
exhaustive and unforgiving, these sessions --

71
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and he said to me, "Wow. Aimee, you are such a strong and powerful little girl,

72
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I think you're going to break one of those bands.

73
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
When you do break it, I'm going to give you a hundred bucks."

74
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Now, of course, this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part

75
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do

76
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward,

77
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence

78
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
into a new and promising experience for me.

79
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision

80
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl

81
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
shaped my own view of myself

82
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
as an inherently strong, powerful and athletic person well into the future.

83
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
This is an example of how adults in positions of power

84
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
can ignite the power of a child.

85
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But, in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries,

86
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want,

87
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable.

88
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society,

89
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
many of which have been brought about by technology.

90
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Certainly, from a medical standpoint,

91
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
my legs, laser surgery for vision impairment,

92
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies

93
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities,

94
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them --

95
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
not to mention social networking platforms

96
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
allow people to self-identify, to claim their own descriptions of themselves,

97
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing.

98
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So, perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now

99
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
what has always been a truth:

100
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society,

101
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset.

102
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
The human ability to adapt, it's an interesting thing,

103
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity,

104
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and I'm going to make an admission:

105
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
This phrase never sat right with me,

106
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it,

107
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and I think I'm starting to figure out why.

108
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Implicit in this phrase of "overcoming adversity"

109
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
is the idea that success, or happiness,

110
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience

111
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
unscathed or unmarked by the experience,

112
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
as if my successes in life have come about from an ability

113
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics,

114
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
or what other people perceive as my disability.

115
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
But, in fact, we are changed. We are marked, of course, by a challenge,

116
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
whether physically, emotionally or both.

117
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing.

118
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around

119
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
in order to resume living our life.

120
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It's part of our life.

121
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And I tend to think of it like my shadow.

122
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Sometimes I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very little,

123
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
but it's always with me.

124
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
And, certainly, I'm not trying to diminish the impact, the weight, of a person's struggle.

125
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
There is adversity and challenge in life,

126
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and it's all very real and relative to every single person,

127
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity,

128
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
but how you're going to meet it.

129
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So, our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity,

130
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
but preparing them to meet it well.

131
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And we do a disservice to our kids

132
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt.

133
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
There's an important difference and distinction

134
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee

135
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled.

136
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And, truthfully, the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront

137
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions.

138
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
In our desire to protect those we care about

139
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
by giving them the cold, hard truth about their medical prognosis,

140
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
or, indeed, a prognosis on the expected quality of their life,

141
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall

142
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that will actually disable someone.

143
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you

144
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and how do we fix it, serves to be more disabling to the individual

145
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
than the pathology itself.

146
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
By not treating the wholeness of a person,

147
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
by not acknowledging their potency,

148
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have.

149
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
We are effectively grading someone's worth to our community.

150
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
So we need to see through the pathology

151
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and into the range of human capability.

152
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And, most importantly, there's a partnership

153
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
between those perceived deficiencies

154
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and our greatest creative ability.

155
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So it's not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times

156
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug,

157
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity.

158
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So maybe the idea I want to put out there is

159
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
not so much overcoming adversity

160
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
as it is opening ourselves up to it,

161
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
embracing it,

162
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
grappling with it,

163
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
to use a wrestling term,

164
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
maybe even dancing with it.

165
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And, perhaps, if we see adversity as natural, consistent and useful,

166
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
we're less burdened by the presence of it.

167
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin,

168
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and it was 150 years ago, when writing about evolution,

169
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that Darwin illustrated, I think, a truth about the human character.

170
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
To paraphrase: It's not the strongest of the species that survives,

171
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
nor is it the most intelligent that survives;

172
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
it is the one that is most adaptable to change.

173
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Conflict is the genesis of creation.

174
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
From Darwin's work, amongst others, we can recognize that

175
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
the human ability to survive and flourish

176
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict

177
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
into transformation.

178
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
So, again, transformation, adaptation, is our greatest human skill.

179
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And, perhaps, until we're tested, we don't know what we're made of.

180
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Maybe that's what adversity gives us:

181
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
a sense of self, a sense of our own power.

182
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
So, we can give ourselves a gift.

183
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
We can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times.

184
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Maybe we can see it as change.

185
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet.

186
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves

187
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
is this idea of normalcy.

188
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Now, who's normal?

189
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
There's no normal.

190
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
There's common, there's typical. There's no normal,

191
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and would you want to meet that poor, beige person if they existed?

192
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
(Laughter)

193
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I don't think so.

194
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy

195
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
to one of possibility -- or potency, to be even a little bit more dangerous --

196
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
we can release the power of so many more children,

197
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community.

198
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Anthropologists tell us that the one thing

199
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
we as humans have always required of our community members

200
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
is to be of use, to be able to contribute.

201
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
There's evidence that Neanderthals, 60,000 years ago,

202
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury,

203
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people

204
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
proved of value to the community.

205
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
They didn't view these people as broken and useless;

206
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
they were seen as rare and valuable.

207
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
A few years ago, I was in a food market in the town where I grew up

208
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania,

209
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes.

210
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
It was summertime: I had shorts on.

211
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
I hear this guy, his voice behind me say, "Well, if it isn't Aimee Mullins."

212
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And I turn around, and it's this older man. I have no idea who he is.

213
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And I said, "I'm sorry, sir, have we met? I don't remember meeting you."

214
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
He said, "Well, you wouldn't remember meeting me.

215
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I mean, when we met I was delivering you from your mother's womb."

216
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
(Laughter)

217
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Oh, that guy.

218
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And, but of course, actually, it did click.

219
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
This man was Dr. Kean,

220
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day,

221
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
because, of course, typical fashion, I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks.

222
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation,

223
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents.

224
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And, because I was born without the fibula bones,

225
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that,

226
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
he had to be the bearer -- this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news.

227
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
He said to me, "I had to give this prognosis to your parents

228
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
that you would never walk,

229
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have

230
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
or any kind of life of independence,

231
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and you've been making liar out of me ever since."

232
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
(Laughter)

233
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
(Applause)

234
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved

235
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood,

236
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
whether winning a second grade spelling bee,

237
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
marching with the Girl Scouts, you know, the Halloween parade,

238
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
winning my college scholarship, or any of my sports victories,

239
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and he was using it, and integrating it into teaching resident students,

240
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School.

241
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And he called this part of the course the X Factor,

242
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
the potential of the human will.

243
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
No prognosis can account for how powerful this could be

244
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
as a determinant in the quality of someone's life.

245
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
And Dr. Kean went on to tell me,

246
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
he said, "In my experience, unless repeatedly told otherwise,

247
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and even if given a modicum of support,

248
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
if left to their own devices, a child will achieve."

249
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
See, Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking.

250
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
He understood that there's a difference between the medical condition

251
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
and what someone might do with it.

252
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
And there's been a shift in my thinking over time,

253
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
in that, if you had asked me at 15 years old,

254
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs,

255
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
I wouldn't have hesitated for a second.

256
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then.

257
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
But if you ask me today, I'm not so sure.

258
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
And it's because of the experiences I've had with them,

259
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
not in spite of the experiences I've had with them.

260
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
And perhaps this shift in me has happened

261
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me

262
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me.

263
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
See, all you really need is one person

264
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
to show you the epiphany of your own power, and you're off.

265
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
If you can hand somebody the key to their own power --

266
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
the human spirit is so receptive -- if you can do that

267
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
and open a door for someone at a crucial moment,

268
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
you are educating them in the best sense.

269
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
You're teaching them to open doors for themselves.

270
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
In fact, the exact meaning of the word "educate"

271
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
comes from the root word "educe."

272
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
It means "to bring forth what is within,

273
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
to bring out potential."

274
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
So again, which potential do we want to bring out?

275
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
There was a case study done in 1960s Britain,

276
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:03,000
when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools.

277
0:19:03.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
It's called the streaming trials. We call it "tracking" here in the States.

278
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:11,000
It's separating students from A, B, C, D and so on.

279
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
And the "A students" get the tougher curriculum, the best teachers, etc.

280
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
Well, they took, over a three-month period,

281
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:21,000
D-level students, gave them A's,

282
0:19:21.26,000 --> 0:19:24,000
told them they were "A's," told them they were bright,

283
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
and at the end of this three-month period,

284
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
they were performing at A-level.

285
0:19:29.26,000 --> 0:19:32,000
And, of course, the heartbreaking, flip side of this study,

286
0:19:32.26,000 --> 0:19:37,000
is that they took the "A students" and told them they were "D's."

287
0:19:37.26,000 --> 0:19:4,000
And that's what happened at the end of that three-month period.

288
0:19:40.26,000 --> 0:19:44,000
Those who were still around in school, besides the people who had dropped out.

289
0:19:46.26,000 --> 0:19:55,000
A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too.

290
0:19:55.26,000 --> 0:19:57,000
The teachers didn't know a switch had been made.

291
0:19:57.26,000 --> 0:20:01,000
They were simply told, "These are the 'A-students,' these are the 'D-students.'"

292
0:20:01.26,000 --> 0:20:06,000
And that's how they went about teaching them and treating them.

293
0:20:07.26,000 --> 0:20:16,000
So, I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit,

294
0:20:16.26,000 --> 0:20:21,000
a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope,

295
0:20:21.26,000 --> 0:20:23,000
it doesn't see beauty,

296
0:20:23.26,000 --> 0:20:29,000
it no longer has our natural, childlike curiosity

297
0:20:29.26,000 --> 0:20:32,000
and our innate ability to imagine.

298
0:20:32.26,000 --> 0:20:37,000
If instead, we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope,

299
0:20:37.26,000 --> 0:20:41,000
to see beauty in themselves and others,

300
0:20:41.26,000 --> 0:20:44,000
to be curious and imaginative,

301
0:20:44.26,000 --> 0:20:48,000
then we are truly using our power well.

302
0:20:48.26,000 --> 0:20:54,000
When a spirit has those qualities, we are able to create new realities

303
0:20:54.26,000 --> 0:20:57,000
and new ways of being.

304
0:20:57.26,000 --> 0:20:59,000
I'd like to leave you with a poem

305
0:20:59.26,000 --> 0:21:03,000
by a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz

306
0:21:03.26,000 --> 0:21:06,000
that my friend, Jacques Dembois told me about,

307
0:21:06.26,000 --> 0:21:11,000
and the poem is called "The God Who Only Knows Four Words":

308
0:21:11.26,000 --> 0:21:15,000
"Every child has known God,

309
0:21:15.26,000 --> 0:21:17,000
not the God of names,

310
0:21:17.26,000 --> 0:21:2,000
not the God of don'ts,

311
0:21:20.26,000 --> 0:21:25,000
but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them,

312
0:21:25.26,000 --> 0:21:32,000
saying, 'Come dance with me.

313
0:21:32.26,000 --> 0:21:35,000
Come, dance with me. Come, dance with me.'"

314
0:21:35.26,000 --> 0:21:37,000
Thank you.

315
0:21:37.26,000 --> 0:21:5,000

1
0:00:12.81,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I was 17 when I chose my career.

2
0:00:17.587,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I was standing outside

3
0:00:2,000 --> 0:00:22,000
on a hot summer night in Florida

4
0:00:23.238,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and just a few miles from the ocean.

5
0:00:26.728,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I was waiting for a miracle to happen.

6
0:00:31.54,000 --> 0:00:34,000
That summer, I was privileged to work as an intern

7
0:00:35.386,000 --> 0:00:36,000
at NASA's Kennedy Space Center,

8
0:00:37.919,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and the miracle I was waiting for

9
0:00:40.204,000 --> 0:00:43,000
was the launch of the Columbia Space Shuttle

10
0:00:43.749,000 --> 0:00:46,000
carrying the Chandra X-Ray Observatory,

11
0:00:47.486,000 --> 0:00:53,000
a telescope that would allow scientists to peer into the edge of black holes.

12
0:00:54.712,000 --> 0:00:57,000
The entire sky filled with light.

13
0:00:58.998,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And it was as if it was daytime in the middle of the night.

14
0:01:03.149,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Soon, we could feel the rumble of the engines vibrating in our chests.

15
0:01:08.003,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And it wasn't a miracle;

16
0:01:10.316,000 --> 0:01:14,000
it was the combined effort of a team of thousands of people

17
0:01:14.357,000 --> 0:01:15,000
who worked together

18
0:01:15.672,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to make was seemed impossible a reality.

19
0:01:19.991,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And I wanted to join that team.

20
0:01:24.872,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So I decided to apply to a university where I could study aerospace engineering.

21
0:01:29.644,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And the following year,

22
0:01:31.008,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I started at MIT in my engineering training

23
0:01:33.596,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and joined a student project building space robots.

24
0:01:37.146,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And everything was going as I planned,

25
0:01:39.841,000 --> 0:01:43,000
except I was confused about something important.

26
0:01:45.768,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Now, my confusion arose in my summer breaks.

27
0:01:49.474,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I traveled to a school in Kenya,

28
0:01:52.915,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and there I volunteered with girls ages five to 17,

29
0:01:57.583,000 --> 0:02:01,000
giving them lessons in English and math and science.

30
0:02:03.143,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And they taught me songs in Swahili.

31
0:02:07.29,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And mostly, I just spent time getting to know the girls,

32
0:02:10.868,000 --> 0:02:11,000
enjoying their presence.

33
0:02:12.754,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And I saw that these girls and the leaders in their community,

34
0:02:16.872,000 --> 0:02:18,000
they were overcoming important barriers

35
0:02:19.802,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to allow these girls to have the best possible chances in life.

36
0:02:24.556,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And I wanted to join that team.

37
0:02:28.931,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I wanted to be part of a team that would help break down barriers

38
0:02:32.012,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and improve the lives of girls around the world.

39
0:02:34.605,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But I was worried that studying aerospace engineering

40
0:02:37.697,000 --> 0:02:38,000
wasn't the most useful.

41
0:02:39.202,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I was worried this team in Kenya couldn't use the technology

42
0:02:42.386,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I was learning about space.

43
0:02:45.305,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But thankfully, I still learned that I was wrong.

44
0:02:49.457,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I came back and interned at NASA again,

45
0:02:51.84,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and this time,

46
0:02:53.022,000 --> 0:02:54,000
a mentor taught me

47
0:02:54.871,000 --> 0:03:,000
that countries like Kenya had been using space technology for decades

48
0:03:01.07,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to improve the lives in their own countries.

49
0:03:03.655,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And then I knew that I could have a career in space

50
0:03:07.209,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and in development.

51
0:03:09.859,000 --> 0:03:1,000
This idea is not new.

52
0:03:11.825,000 --> 0:03:15,000
In fact, in 1967, the nations of the world came together

53
0:03:16.049,000 --> 0:03:18,000
to write the Outer Space Treaty.

54
0:03:19.607,000 --> 0:03:21,000
This treaty made a bold statement,

55
0:03:22.293,000 --> 0:03:26,000
saying, "The exploration and use of outer space

56
0:03:26.379,000 --> 0:03:29,000
should be carried on for the benefit of all peoples,

57
0:03:30.573,000 --> 0:03:34,000
irrespective of their level of economic or scientific development."

58
0:03:37.089,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We have not truly lived up to this ideal,

59
0:03:39.47,000 --> 0:03:42,000
although people have worked for decades to make this a reality.

60
0:03:43.826,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Forces such as colonialism and racism

61
0:03:47.88,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and gender inequality

62
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
have actually excluded many people from the benefits of space

63
0:03:54.751,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and caused us to believe that space is for the few

64
0:03:58.316,000 --> 0:04:,000
or the rich or elite.

65
0:04:01.731,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But we cannot afford this attitude,

66
0:04:04.209,000 --> 0:04:07,000
because the world is engaged in a vital mission

67
0:04:07.364,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to improve life for everyone.

68
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Our road map for this mission comes from the 17 Sustainable Development Goals

69
0:04:16.073,000 --> 0:04:17,000
of the United Nations.

70
0:04:17.808,000 --> 0:04:19,000
All the member states of the United Nations have agreed

71
0:04:20.531,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that these are priorities between now and 2030.

72
0:04:24.526,000 --> 0:04:29,000
These goals give us our key moments and opportunities of our time --

73
0:04:30.323,000 --> 0:04:32,000
opportunities to end extreme poverty,

74
0:04:33.318,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to insure that everyone has access to food and clean water.

75
0:04:39.72,000 --> 0:04:42,000
We must pursue these goals as a global community.

76
0:04:43.861,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And technology from space supports sustainable development.

77
0:04:48.891,000 --> 0:04:51,000
In fact, there are six space services

78
0:04:51.934,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that can help us pursue the Sustainable Development Goals.

79
0:04:56.709,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Over the next few minutes, let's explore these six services,

80
0:04:59.986,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and see examples of just a few of the goals they help support.

81
0:05:03.529,000 --> 0:05:04,000
You ready?

82
0:05:05.104,000 --> 0:05:06,000
OK.

83
0:05:06.286,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Communication satellites provide access to phone and internet service

84
0:05:10.503,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to almost any location on Earth.

85
0:05:12.622,000 --> 0:05:15,000
This is particularly important during times of disaster recovery.

86
0:05:16.523,000 --> 0:05:19,000
When Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines,

87
0:05:20.065,000 --> 0:05:22,000
the local communication networks needed to be repaired,

88
0:05:22.863,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and teams brought in inflatable communication antennas

89
0:05:26.195,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that could link to satellites.

90
0:05:28.209,000 --> 0:05:3,000
This was useful during the time of repair and recovery.

91
0:05:31.453,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Positioning satellites tell us where we are

92
0:05:34.807,000 --> 0:05:35,000
by telling us where they are.

93
0:05:37.835,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Scientists can use this technology to track endangered wildlife.

94
0:05:42.727,000 --> 0:05:44,000
This turtle has been fitted with a system

95
0:05:45.261,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that allows it to receive location information from positioning satellites,

96
0:05:49.85,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and they send the location information to scientists

97
0:05:52.447,000 --> 0:05:53,000
via communication satellites.

98
0:05:55.112,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Scientists can use this knowledge to then make better policies

99
0:05:58.287,000 --> 0:06:,000
and help determine how to keep these animals alive.

100
0:06:02.46,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Earth observation satellites.

101
0:06:04.928,000 --> 0:06:06,000
They tell us what's going on in our environment.

102
0:06:07.546,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Right now, there are about 150 satellites

103
0:06:11.068,000 --> 0:06:13,000
operated by over 60 government agencies,

104
0:06:13.874,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and these are just those observing the Earth.

105
0:06:16.117,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And meanwhile, companies are adding to this list.

106
0:06:19.157,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Most of the governments provide the data from the satellites for free online.

107
0:06:23.018,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Some of these satellites provide images like this,

108
0:06:26.22,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that show what you would see from a camera.

109
0:06:28.656,000 --> 0:06:3,000
This is an image showing agricultural land in Kansas.

110
0:06:32.742,000 --> 0:06:34,000
However, the majority of the Earth observation satellites

111
0:06:35.651,000 --> 0:06:37,000
don't take pictures at all.

112
0:06:37.898,000 --> 0:06:38,000
They take measurements.

113
0:06:39.449,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And they combine these measurements with complex computer models

114
0:06:42.574,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and make beautiful, global visualizations such as this one,

115
0:06:45.877,000 --> 0:06:46,000
showing the ocean currents

116
0:06:47.807,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and the temperature of the ocean, globally.

117
0:06:51.275,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Or we can look at the salt and smoke and dust in the atmosphere,

118
0:06:59.561,000 --> 0:07:01,000
or the rainfall and snowfall, globally,

119
0:07:05.085,000 --> 0:07:1,000
as well as the annual cycle of vegetation on land and in the ocean.

120
0:07:12.065,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Now, scientists can take this information about the rainfall and the vegetation

121
0:07:16.451,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and use it to understand

122
0:07:17.865,000 --> 0:07:2,000
what areas on Earth are in danger of a famine or a drought

123
0:07:21.654,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and provide that information to aid organizations

124
0:07:24.32,000 --> 0:07:27,000
so they can be prepared with food aid before the hunger becomes severe.

125
0:07:28.9,000 --> 0:07:32,000
In space, we have an orbiting laboratory on the International Space Station.

126
0:07:34.653,000 --> 0:07:37,000
The vehicle and everything inside are in a form of free fall

127
0:07:37.705,000 --> 0:07:38,000
around the Earth,

128
0:07:38.88,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and they don't experience the effect of gravity.

129
0:07:42.219,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And because of this, we call it "microgravity."

130
0:07:45.412,000 --> 0:07:47,000
When astronauts are in the microgravity environment,

131
0:07:47.899,000 --> 0:07:5,000
their bodies react as if they're aging rapidly.

132
0:07:51.888,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Their bones and muscles weaken,

133
0:07:54.328,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and their cardiovascular system and their immune system change.

134
0:07:59.052,000 --> 0:08:02,000
As scientists study how to keep astronauts healthy in space,

135
0:08:02.324,000 --> 0:08:05,000
we can take the exercises and techniques we use for astronauts

136
0:08:05.656,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and transfer them to people on Earth

137
0:08:07.632,000 --> 0:08:08,000
to improve our health here.

138
0:08:09.465,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Often, as we develop technology for astronauts and exploration

139
0:08:12.96,000 --> 0:08:13,000
or for spacecraft,

140
0:08:14.254,000 --> 0:08:17,000
we can also transfer those inventions to improve life on Earth.

141
0:08:17.837,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Here's one of my favorites.

142
0:08:19.195,000 --> 0:08:2,000
It's a water filtration system,

143
0:08:20.975,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and a key component of it is based on the technology

144
0:08:24.022,000 --> 0:08:26,000
to filter wastewater on the space station.

145
0:08:26.439,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It's now being used around the world.

146
0:08:28.795,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Space is also an infinite source of inspiration,

147
0:08:32.237,000 --> 0:08:33,000
through education,

148
0:08:33.442,000 --> 0:08:34,000
through research and astronomy

149
0:08:35.1,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and that age-old experience of stargazing.

150
0:08:38.818,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Now, countries around the world are engaging in advancing

151
0:08:42.121,000 --> 0:08:43,000
their own development

152
0:08:43.321,000 --> 0:08:46,000
by increasing their local knowledge of engineering and science and space.

153
0:08:47.644,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Let's meet some of the world's newest satellite engineers.

154
0:08:52.149,000 --> 0:08:55,000
This is Elyka Abello, from Venezuela.

155
0:08:56.264,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Elyka is training as a satellite engineer

156
0:08:59.346,000 --> 0:09:01,000
as part of her national satellite program in Venezuela.

157
0:09:02.75,000 --> 0:09:03,000
She has designed a software tool

158
0:09:04.596,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that allows her team to better design the power systems for engineering.

159
0:09:10.036,000 --> 0:09:12,000
This is Adel Castillo-Duran,

160
0:09:12.875,000 --> 0:09:13,000
from the Philippines.

161
0:09:14.474,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Adel is both a meteorologist and a satellite engineer,

162
0:09:17.505,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and she uses data from satellites in her weather forecasting.

163
0:09:22.549,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And finally, meet Hala.

164
0:09:24.708,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Hala is from the Sudan,

165
0:09:26.35,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and as she was studying electrical engineering as an undergraduate

166
0:09:29.614,000 --> 0:09:3,000
in Khartoum,

167
0:09:30.797,000 --> 0:09:33,000
she and several students decided to build their own satellite.

168
0:09:33.977,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And later, Hala earned a scholarship to study satellite engineering

169
0:09:38.375,000 --> 0:09:39,000
at the graduate level.

170
0:09:41.093,000 --> 0:09:43,000
These stories that I've shared with you

171
0:09:43.391,000 --> 0:09:47,000
all illustrate that space truly is useful for sustainable development

172
0:09:47.528,000 --> 0:09:48,000
for the benefit of all peoples.

173
0:09:50.016,000 --> 0:09:51,000
But we have more work to do,

174
0:09:52.487,000 --> 0:09:55,000
because there are still barriers that exclude people from space

175
0:09:56.241,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and limit the impact of this technology.

176
0:09:59.402,000 --> 0:10:02,000
For many people, Earth observation data is complex.

177
0:10:03.576,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And satellite communication services are too expensive.

178
0:10:06.966,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And microgravity research just appears to be inaccessible.

179
0:10:11.611,000 --> 0:10:15,000
This is what motivates my work as a professor at MIT's Media Lab.

180
0:10:16.84,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I've recently founded a new research group called Space Enabled.

181
0:10:22.829,000 --> 0:10:26,000
We are working to tear down these barriers that limit the benefits of space.

182
0:10:27.699,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And we're also going to develop the future applications

183
0:10:30.371,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that will continue to contribute to sustainable development.

184
0:10:34.533,000 --> 0:10:35,000
We'll keep on this work

185
0:10:36.165,000 --> 0:10:4,000
until we can truly say that space is for the benefit of all peoples,

186
0:10:40.834,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and we are all space enabled.

187
0:10:44.815,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Thank you.

188
0:10:45.998,000 --> 0:10:47,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.933,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm an immigrant from Venezuela,

2
0:00:16.255,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and I've lived in the US for six years.

3
0:00:19.884,000 --> 0:00:21,000
If you ask me about my life as an expatriate,

4
0:00:22.806,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I would say that I've been lucky.

5
0:00:24.682,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But it hasn't been easy.

6
0:00:26.536,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Growing up, I never thought that I was going to leave my homeland.

7
0:00:30.338,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I participated in my first student protest in 2007,

8
0:00:34.734,000 --> 0:00:37,000
when the president shut down one of the most important news networks.

9
0:00:39.105,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I was getting my bachelor's degree in communications,

10
0:00:41.983,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and that was the first time I realized I couldn't take free speech for granted.

11
0:00:47.977,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We knew things were getting bad, but we never saw what was coming:

12
0:00:51.469,000 --> 0:00:54,000
an economic crisis, infrastructure breaking down,

13
0:00:54.796,000 --> 0:00:56,000
citywide electrical blackouts,

14
0:00:57.278,000 --> 0:01:01,000
the decline of public health care and shortage of medicines,

15
0:01:01.331,000 --> 0:01:03,000
disease outbreaks and starvation.

16
0:01:04.226,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I moved to Canada with my husband in 2013,

17
0:01:07.753,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and we always thought we'd move back home when the crisis improved.

18
0:01:11.769,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But we never did.

19
0:01:13.329,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Nearly all my childhood friends have left the country,

20
0:01:16.391,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but my parents are still there.

21
0:01:18.843,000 --> 0:01:2,000
There have been moments where I've called my mom,

22
0:01:21.237,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and I could hear people screaming and crying in the background

23
0:01:25.521,000 --> 0:01:27,000
as teargas bombs exploded in the streets.

24
0:01:28.541,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And my mom, as if I couldn't hear it, would always tell me,

25
0:01:32.793,000 --> 0:01:34,000
(Speaking Spanish)

26
0:01:35.589,000 --> 0:01:36,000
"We're fine, don't worry."

27
0:01:37.559,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But of course, I worry.

28
0:01:38.945,000 --> 0:01:41,000
It's my parents, and I'm 4,000 miles away.

29
0:01:42.712,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Today, I'm just one of more than four million Venezuelans

30
0:01:46.797,000 --> 0:01:47,000
who have left their home country.

31
0:01:49.964,000 --> 0:01:51,000
A lot of my friends are Venezuelan immigrants,

32
0:01:52.217,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and in the last few years,

33
0:01:53.778,000 --> 0:01:56,000
we've begun talking about how we could make a difference

34
0:01:57.162,000 --> 0:01:58,000
when we live so far away.

35
0:01:59.181,000 --> 0:02:03,000
That is how Code for Venezuela was born in 2019.

36
0:02:04.026,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It began with a hackathon, because we are experts in tech,

37
0:02:07.448,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and we thought we could use our tech skills

38
0:02:10.062,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to create solutions for people on the ground.

39
0:02:12.982,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But first, we needed to find some experts actually living inside Venezuela

40
0:02:17.974,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to guide us.

41
0:02:19.389,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We'd see so many other hackathons

42
0:02:21.384,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that came up with wily, ambitious, incredible technological solutions

43
0:02:25.541,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that sounded great in theory but ultimately failed to work

44
0:02:29.383,000 --> 0:02:32,000
in the actual countries they were intended to help.

45
0:02:33.071,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Many of us have been living abroad for years,

46
0:02:35.702,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and we are detached from the day-to-day problems

47
0:02:38.797,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that people are facing in Venezuela.

48
0:02:40.922,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So we turned to the experts actually living inside of the country.

49
0:02:45.636,000 --> 0:02:47,000
For example, Julio Castro,

50
0:02:47.906,000 --> 0:02:5,000
a doctor and one of the leaders of Médicos por la Salud.

51
0:02:52.545,000 --> 0:02:57,000
When the government stopped publishing official health care data in 2015,

52
0:02:57.848,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Dr. Julio began collecting information himself,

53
0:03:02.006,000 --> 0:03:05,000
using an informal but coordinated system

54
0:03:05.501,000 --> 0:03:07,000
of cell phone communications.

55
0:03:07.703,000 --> 0:03:11,000
They track available personnel, medical supplies, mortality data,

56
0:03:12.35,000 --> 0:03:13,000
disease outbreaks;

57
0:03:13.928,000 --> 0:03:14,000
compile it into a report;

58
0:03:15.534,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and then share that on Twitter.

59
0:03:17.302,000 --> 0:03:21,000
He became our go-to expert on health care in Venezuela.

60
0:03:21.527,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Luis Carlos Díaz,

61
0:03:22.815,000 --> 0:03:26,000
a widely recognized journalist who reports acts of censorship

62
0:03:27.287,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and human rights violations suffered by the people of Venezuela,

63
0:03:31.996,000 --> 0:03:34,000
he helps us make sense of what is happening there,

64
0:03:35.229,000 --> 0:03:37,000
since the news is controlled by the government.

65
0:03:38.581,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We call these people our heroes on the ground.

66
0:03:41.511,000 --> 0:03:44,000
With their expert advice, we came up with a series of challenges

67
0:03:45.124,000 --> 0:03:47,000
for hackathon participants.

68
0:03:47.206,000 --> 0:03:5,000
In that first hackathon, we had 300 participants

69
0:03:50.497,000 --> 0:03:51,000
from seven countries

70
0:03:51.846,000 --> 0:03:54,000
come up with 16 different project submissions.

71
0:03:55.394,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We picked the projects with the most potential

72
0:03:57.995,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and continued working on them after the event.

73
0:04:00.857,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Today, I'll share two of our most successful projects

74
0:04:04.953,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to give you a taste of the impact we are having so far.

75
0:04:08.524,000 --> 0:04:11,000
They're called MediTweet and Blackout Tracker.

76
0:04:12.065,000 --> 0:04:14,000
MediTweet is an intelligent Twitter bot

77
0:04:14.573,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that helps Venezuelans find the medicine they need.

78
0:04:18.178,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Right now in Venezuela,

79
0:04:20.032,000 --> 0:04:22,000
if you get sick and you go to a hospital,

80
0:04:22.458,000 --> 0:04:27,000
there is a good chance they won't have the right medical supplies to treat you.

81
0:04:27.505,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The situation is so bad

82
0:04:29.368,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that patients often get a "shopping list" from the doctor

83
0:04:33.324,000 --> 0:04:34,000
instead of a prescription.

84
0:04:36.028,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I live the need for this firsthand.

85
0:04:38.463,000 --> 0:04:42,000
My mom was diagnosed with cancer in 2015.

86
0:04:42.946,000 --> 0:04:44,000
She needed to have a lumbar puncture

87
0:04:45.048,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to get a final diagnosis and treatment plan.

88
0:04:49.197,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But the needle for this procedure wasn't available.

89
0:04:52.055,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I was in Venezuela at that time,

90
0:04:54.566,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and I was seeing my mom getting worse in front of me every day.

91
0:04:59.751,000 --> 0:05:02,000
After looking everywhere, we found the needle in a site

92
0:05:02.812,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that is like the eBay of Latin America.

93
0:05:05.886,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I met the seller in a local bakery,

94
0:05:07.73,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and it was like buying something on the black market.

95
0:05:10.449,000 --> 0:05:13,000
My mom brought the needle to her doctor, and he did the procedure.

96
0:05:14.304,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Without this, she could have died.

97
0:05:17.926,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But it's not just medical supplies,

98
0:05:19.883,000 --> 0:05:2,000
it's medicines, too.

99
0:05:21.262,000 --> 0:05:22,000
When she was first diagnosed,

100
0:05:22.744,000 --> 0:05:24,000
we bought her treatment in a state pharmacy,

101
0:05:25.479,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and it was, like, practically free.

102
0:05:27.618,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But then the state pharmacy ran out,

103
0:05:30.322,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and we still had six months of treatment ahead.

104
0:05:34.576,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Six months of treatment ahead.

105
0:05:38.124,000 --> 0:05:41,000
We bought some medicines online and the rest in Mexico.

106
0:05:41.846,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Now she's in her third year of remission,

107
0:05:44.432,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and every time that I call,

108
0:05:45.983,000 --> 0:05:47,000
she tells me, "I'm fine, don't worry."

109
0:05:49.711,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But not everyone can afford to leave the country,

110
0:05:52.325,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and many aren't healthy enough to travel.

111
0:05:55.434,000 --> 0:05:57,000
That is why people turn to Twitter,

112
0:05:57.55,000 --> 0:06:01,000
buying and selling medicines using the hashtag #ServicioPublico,

113
0:06:01.961,000 --> 0:06:02,000
meaning "public service."

114
0:06:04.358,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Our Twitter bot scans Twitter for the hashtag #ServicioPublico

115
0:06:08.824,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and connects users who are asking for specific medicines

116
0:06:12.431,000 --> 0:06:15,000
with those who are selling their private leftovers.

117
0:06:16.187,000 --> 0:06:19,000
We also pool the location data of those Twitter users

118
0:06:19.515,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and use it for a visualization tool.

119
0:06:22.403,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It gives local organizations like Médicos por la Salud

120
0:06:26.346,000 --> 0:06:28,000
a sense of where they have a shortage.

121
0:06:29.204,000 --> 0:06:32,000
We can also apply machine learning algorithms

122
0:06:32.331,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to detect clusters of disease.

123
0:06:34.742,000 --> 0:06:35,000
If they've received humanitarian aid,

124
0:06:36.652,000 --> 0:06:38,000
this could help them to make better decisions

125
0:06:39.506,000 --> 0:06:41,000
about the distributions of the supplies.

126
0:06:43.239,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Our second project, is called Blackout Tracker.

127
0:06:47.001,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Venezuela is currently going through an electricity crisis.

128
0:06:51.365,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Last year, Venezuela suffered what some people consider

129
0:06:55.197,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the worst power failures in Venezuelan history.

130
0:06:58.95,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I had two long days without communication with my parents.

131
0:07:03.175,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Some cities experienced blackouts every day.

132
0:07:06.157,000 --> 0:07:08,000
But you only know about this on social media.

133
0:07:09.532,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The government won't report blackouts on the news.

134
0:07:13.155,000 --> 0:07:14,000
When the power goes out,

135
0:07:15.114,000 --> 0:07:2,000
many Venezuelans, we quickly tweet out the location with the hashtag #SinLuz,

136
0:07:20.636,000 --> 0:07:22,000
meaning "without electricity,"

137
0:07:22.939,000 --> 0:07:24,000
before their phones ran out of battery,

138
0:07:25.418,000 --> 0:07:27,000
so people around the country know what is happening.

139
0:07:29.245,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Like MediTweet,

140
0:07:31.065,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Blackout Tracker scans Twitter for the hashtag #SinLuz

141
0:07:35.406,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and creates a map using the location data of those users.

142
0:07:39.426,000 --> 0:07:4,000
You can quickly see

143
0:07:40.97,000 --> 0:07:42,000
where the blackouts are happening today

144
0:07:43.263,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and how many blackouts have happened over time.

145
0:07:47.887,000 --> 0:07:49,000
People want to know what is happening,

146
0:07:50.179,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and this is our answer.

147
0:07:51.678,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But it's also a way of holding the government accountable.

148
0:07:55.427,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It's easy for them to deny that the problem exists

149
0:07:58.097,000 --> 0:07:59,000
or make excuses,

150
0:07:59.376,000 --> 0:08:01,000
because there is no official data on it.

151
0:08:01.933,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Blackout Tracker shows how bad the problem really is.

152
0:08:06.08,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Now, some people in Silicon Valley may look at these projects

153
0:08:10.502,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and say that there are no major technological innovations.

154
0:08:13.894,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But that is the point.

155
0:08:15.583,000 --> 0:08:17,000
These projects are not insanely advanced,

156
0:08:18.279,000 --> 0:08:2,000
but it's what the people of Venezuela need,

157
0:08:20.632,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and they can have a tremendous impact.

158
0:08:23.351,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Beyond these projects, perhaps our most significant accomplishment

159
0:08:27.65,000 --> 0:08:29,000
is that a movement has been created,

160
0:08:30.056,000 --> 0:08:33,000
one where people around the world are coming together

161
0:08:33.677,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to use their professional skills to create solutions for the people of Venezuela.

162
0:08:38.71,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And because we are partnering with locals,

163
0:08:40.831,000 --> 0:08:43,000
we are creating the solutions that people want and need.

164
0:08:44.79,000 --> 0:08:45,000
What is so great about this

165
0:08:46.565,000 --> 0:08:48,000
is that we are using our professional skills,

166
0:08:49.046,000 --> 0:08:51,000
so it comes easily and naturally.

167
0:08:51.384,000 --> 0:08:54,000
It's not that hard for us to make a difference.

168
0:08:54.816,000 --> 0:08:56,000
If someone from San Francisco

169
0:08:56.963,000 --> 0:08:58,000
were to hire professionals to create solutions

170
0:08:59.405,000 --> 0:09:01,000
like MediTweet or Blackout Tracker,

171
0:09:01.7,000 --> 0:09:03,000
it would cost a small fortune.

172
0:09:03.947,000 --> 0:09:04,000
By donating our services,

173
0:09:05.386,000 --> 0:09:09,000
we are making a bigger impact than if we were just to donate money.

174
0:09:10.761,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And you can do the same thing --

175
0:09:12.357,000 --> 0:09:13,000
not in Venezuela, necessarily,

176
0:09:13.888,000 --> 0:09:14,000
but in your own community.

177
0:09:16.415,000 --> 0:09:18,000
In a world that is more connected than ever,

178
0:09:19.056,000 --> 0:09:24,000
we still see how specialized communities can be living isolated or in silos.

179
0:09:25.501,000 --> 0:09:27,000
There are so many great ways to help,

180
0:09:28.024,000 --> 0:09:31,000
but I believe that you can use your professional skills

181
0:09:31.2,000 --> 0:09:34,000
to connect diverse communities and create effective solutions

182
0:09:34.681,000 --> 0:09:35,000
through those relationships.

183
0:09:37.524,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Anyone with knowledge and professional skills

184
0:09:41.698,000 --> 0:09:45,000
has a powerful force to bring hope to a community.

185
0:09:46.248,000 --> 0:09:49,000
For us at Code for Venezuela,

186
0:09:49.441,000 --> 0:09:5,000
this is just the beginning.

187
0:09:50.963,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Thank you.

188
0:09:52.155,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.96,000 --> 0:00:16,000
My inbox is full of hate mails and personal abuse

2
0:00:17.56,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and has been for years.

3
0:00:20.24,000 --> 0:00:24,000
In 2010, I started answering those mails

4
0:00:24.36,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and suggesting to the writer that we might meet for coffee and a chat.

5
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I have had hundreds of encounters.

6
0:00:33.64,000 --> 0:00:36,000
They have taught me something important that I want to share with you.

7
0:00:39.56,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I was born in Turkey from Kurdish parents

8
0:00:42.6,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and we moved to Denmark when I was a young child.

9
0:00:46.2,000 --> 0:00:49,000
In 2007, I ran for a seat in the Danish parliament

10
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
as one of the first women with a minority background.

11
0:00:54.04,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I was elected,

12
0:00:55.56,000 --> 0:00:58,000
but I soon found out that not everyone was happy about it

13
0:00:59.56,000 --> 0:01:04,000
as I had to quickly get used to finding hate messages in my inbox.

14
0:01:06.84,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Those emails would begin with something like this:

15
0:01:10.96,000 --> 0:01:12,000
"What's a raghead like you doing in our parliament?"

16
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I never answered.

17
0:01:16.64,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I'd just delete the emails.

18
0:01:18.76,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I just thought that the senders and I had nothing in common.

19
0:01:23.92,000 --> 0:01:25,000
They didn't understand me,

20
0:01:25.96,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and I didn't understand them.

21
0:01:29.88,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Then one day, one of my colleagues in the parliament said

22
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that I should save the hate mails.

23
0:01:36.08,000 --> 0:01:39,000
"When something happens to you, it will give the police a lead."

24
0:01:40.12,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:41.88,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I noticed that she said, "When something happens" and not "if."

26
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:48.48,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Sometimes hateful letters were also sent to my home address.

28
0:01:53.44,000 --> 0:01:56,000
The more I became involved in public debate,

29
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:59,000
the more hate mail and threats I received.

30
0:02:01.08,000 --> 0:02:03,000
After a while, I got a secret address

31
0:02:03.6,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and I had to take extra precautions to protect my family.

32
0:02:09.84,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Then in 2010, a Nazi began to harass me.

33
0:02:13.8,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It was a man who had attacked Muslim women on the street.

34
0:02:18.32,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Over time, it became much worse.

35
0:02:22.479,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I was at the zoo with my children, and the phone was ringing constantly.

36
0:02:28.24,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It was the Nazi.

37
0:02:30.56,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I had the impression that he was close.

38
0:02:33.56,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We headed home.

39
0:02:35.8,000 --> 0:02:36,000
When we got back,

40
0:02:37.6,000 --> 0:02:42,000
my son asked, "Why does he hate you so much, Mom,

41
0:02:43.6,000 --> 0:02:44,000
when he doesn't even know you?"

42
0:02:47.96,000 --> 0:02:48,000
"Some people are just stupid," I said.

43
0:02:50.8,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And at the time, I actually thought that was a pretty clever answer.

44
0:02:55.52,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And I suspect that that is the answer most of us would give.

45
0:02:59.56,000 --> 0:03:,000
The others --

46
0:03:01.6,000 --> 0:03:03,000
they are stupid, brainwashed, ignorant.

47
0:03:05.64,000 --> 0:03:08,000
We are the good guys and they are the bad guys, period.

48
0:03:11.2,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Several weeks later I was at a friend's house,

49
0:03:13.64,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and I was very upset and angry about all the hate and racism I had met.

50
0:03:20.84,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It was he who suggested that I should call them up

51
0:03:23.88,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and visit them.

52
0:03:26.68,000 --> 0:03:27,000
"They will kill me," I said.

53
0:03:29.56,000 --> 0:03:32,000
"They would never attack a member of the Danish Parliament," he said.

54
0:03:33.12,000 --> 0:03:37,000
"And anyway, if they killed you, you would become a martyr."

55
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Laughter)

56
0:03:39.32,000 --> 0:03:41,000
"So it's pure win-win situation for you."

57
0:03:41.92,000 --> 0:03:43,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:45.88,000 --> 0:03:47,000
His advice was so unexpected,

59
0:03:48.68,000 --> 0:03:49,000
when I got home,

60
0:03:49.96,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I turned on my computer

61
0:03:51.24,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and opened the folder where I had saved all the hate mail.

62
0:03:55.76,000 --> 0:03:56,000
There were literally hundreds of them.

63
0:03:58.6,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Emails that started with words like "terrorist,"

64
0:04:03.08,000 --> 0:04:04,000
"raghead,"

65
0:04:04.72,000 --> 0:04:05,000
"rat," "whore."

66
0:04:08.12,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I decided to contact the one who had sent me the most.

67
0:04:12.92,000 --> 0:04:13,000
His name was Ingolf.

68
0:04:17.08,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I decided to contact him just once so I could say at least I had tried.

69
0:04:23.88,000 --> 0:04:25,000
To my surprise and shock,

70
0:04:26.6,000 --> 0:04:27,000
he answered the phone.

71
0:04:28.959,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I blurted out, "Hello, my name is Özlem. You have sent me so many hate mails.

72
0:04:33.92,000 --> 0:04:34,000
You don't know me, I don't know you.

73
0:04:35.68,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I was wondering if I could come around and we can drink a coffee together

74
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and talk about it?"

75
0:04:40.44,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Laughter)

76
0:04:43.92,000 --> 0:04:45,000
There was silence on the line.

77
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And then he said,

78
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
"I have to ask my wife."

79
0:04:52.12,000 --> 0:04:53,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:53.52,000 --> 0:04:54,000
What?

81
0:04:54.76,000 --> 0:04:55,000
The racist has a wife?

82
0:04:56.2,000 --> 0:04:57,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:58.08,000 --> 0:05:01,000
A couple of days later, we met at his house.

84
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I will never forget when he opened his front door

85
0:05:05.44,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and reached out to shake my hand.

86
0:05:08.88,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I felt so disappointed.

87
0:05:10.92,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Laughter)

88
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
because he looked nothing like I'd imagined.

89
0:05:16.4,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I had expected a horrible person --

90
0:05:19.32,000 --> 0:05:21,000
dirty, messy house.

91
0:05:21.48,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It was not.

92
0:05:23.72,000 --> 0:05:24,000
His house smelled of coffee

93
0:05:25.52,000 --> 0:05:29,000
which was served from a coffee set identical to the one my parents used.

94
0:05:30.76,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I ended up staying for two and a half hours.

95
0:05:34.84,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And we had so many things in common.

96
0:05:39.12,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Even our prejudices were alike.

97
0:05:41.96,000 --> 0:05:42,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:43.88,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Ingolf told me that when he waits for the bus

99
0:05:46.96,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and the bus stops 10 meters away from him,

100
0:05:50.44,000 --> 0:05:52,000
it was because the driver was a "raghead."

101
0:05:55.12,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I recognized that feeling.

102
0:05:57.04,000 --> 0:05:58,000
When I was young

103
0:05:59.56,000 --> 0:06:,000
and I waited for the bus

104
0:06:01.08,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and it stopped 10 meters away from me,

105
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I was sure that the driver was a racist.

106
0:06:09.6,000 --> 0:06:11,000
When I got home,

107
0:06:11.72,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I was very ambivalent about my experience.

108
0:06:15.12,000 --> 0:06:17,000
On the one hand, I really liked Ingolf.

109
0:06:18.92,000 --> 0:06:21,000
He was easy and pleasant to talk to,

110
0:06:23.4,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but on the other hand,

111
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I couldn't stand the idea of having so much in common

112
0:06:29.72,000 --> 0:06:32,000
with someone who had such clearly racist views.

113
0:06:36.08,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Gradually,

114
0:06:37.32,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and painfully,

115
0:06:39.04,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I came to realize

116
0:06:40.32,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that I had been just as judgmental of those who had sent me hate mails

117
0:06:46.32,000 --> 0:06:47,000
as they had been of me.

118
0:06:50.64,000 --> 0:06:54,000
This was the beginning of what I call #dialoguecoffee.

119
0:06:56.96,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Basically, I sit down for coffee

120
0:06:59.08,000 --> 0:07:02,000
with people who have said the most terrible things to me

121
0:07:02.92,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to try to understand why they hate people like me

122
0:07:06.76,000 --> 0:07:07,000
when they don't even know me.

123
0:07:10.8,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I have been doing this the last eight years.

124
0:07:14.76,000 --> 0:07:17,000
The vast majority of people I approach agree to meet me.

125
0:07:18.2,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Most of them are men,

126
0:07:19.56,000 --> 0:07:2,000
but I have also met women.

127
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I have made it a rule to always meet them in their house

128
0:07:25.92,000 --> 0:07:27,000
to convey from the outset that I trust them.

129
0:07:28.96,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I always bring food because when we eat together,

130
0:07:32.8,000 --> 0:07:34,000
it is easier to find what we have in common

131
0:07:35.24,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and make peace together.

132
0:07:38.48,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Along the way, I have learned some valuable lessons.

133
0:07:42.92,000 --> 0:07:45,000
The people who sent hate mails are workers,

134
0:07:46.04,000 --> 0:07:48,000
husbands, wives,

135
0:07:48.36,000 --> 0:07:49,000
parents like you and me.

136
0:07:50.52,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I'm not saying that their behavior is acceptable,

137
0:07:54.88,000 --> 0:07:58,000
but I have learned to distance myself from the hateful views

138
0:07:59.64,000 --> 0:08:04,000
without distancing myself from the person who's expressing those views.

139
0:08:07.24,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And I have discovered

140
0:08:09.32,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that the people I visit are just as afraid of people they don't know

141
0:08:14.24,000 --> 0:08:19,000
as I was afraid of them before I started inviting myself for coffee.

142
0:08:21.44,000 --> 0:08:24,000
During these meetings, a specific theme keeps coming up.

143
0:08:24.96,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It shows up regardless whether I'm talking to a humanist or a racist,

144
0:08:29.32,000 --> 0:08:3,000
a man, a woman,

145
0:08:30.84,000 --> 0:08:32,000
a Muslim or an atheist.

146
0:08:32.92,000 --> 0:08:33,000
They all seem to think

147
0:08:34.88,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that other people are to blame for the hate

148
0:08:38.04,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and for the generalization of groups.

149
0:08:40.32,000 --> 0:08:44,000
They all believe that other people have to stop demonizing.

150
0:08:45.08,000 --> 0:08:47,000
They point at politicians, the media, their neighbor

151
0:08:47.88,000 --> 0:08:49,000
or the bus driver who stops 10 meters away.

152
0:08:51.6,000 --> 0:08:53,000
But when I asked, "What about you?

153
0:08:55.039,000 --> 0:08:56,000
What can you do?",

154
0:08:57.36,000 --> 0:08:59,000
the reply is usually,

155
0:08:59.6,000 --> 0:09:,000
"What can I do?

156
0:09:01.4,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I have no influence.

157
0:09:03.48,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I have no power."

158
0:09:06.4,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I know that feeling.

159
0:09:08.36,000 --> 0:09:09,000
For a large part of my life,

160
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I also thought that I didn't have any power or influence --

161
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
even when I was a member of the Danish parliament.

162
0:09:20.12,000 --> 0:09:22,000
But today I know the reality is different.

163
0:09:22.88,000 --> 0:09:24,000
We all have power and influence where we are,

164
0:09:25.8,000 --> 0:09:27,000
so we must never,

165
0:09:28.24,000 --> 0:09:31,000
never underestimate our own potential.

166
0:09:35.04,000 --> 0:09:37,000
The #dialoguecoffee meetings have taught me

167
0:09:37.12,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that people of all political convictions can be caught demonizing

168
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
the others with different views.

169
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I know what I'm talking about.

170
0:09:45.88,000 --> 0:09:49,000
As a young child, I hated different population groups.

171
0:09:50.6,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And at the time, my religious views were very extreme.

172
0:09:54.72,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But my friendship with Turks, with Danes, with Jews and with racists

173
0:09:59.48,000 --> 0:10:02,000
has vaccinated me against my own prejudices.

174
0:10:04.28,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I grew up in a working-class family,

175
0:10:06.48,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and on my journey I have met many people who have insisted on speaking to me.

176
0:10:13.12,000 --> 0:10:14,000
They have changed my views.

177
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
They have formed me as a democratic citizen and a bridge builder.

178
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:24,000
If you want to prevent hate and violence,

179
0:10:24.32,000 --> 0:10:27,000
we have to talk to as many people as possible

180
0:10:27.76,000 --> 0:10:29,000
for as long as possible

181
0:10:30.08,000 --> 0:10:32,000
while being as open as possible.

182
0:10:33.12,000 --> 0:10:36,000
That can only be achieved through debate,

183
0:10:36.4,000 --> 0:10:37,000
critical conversation

184
0:10:38.32,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and insisting on dialogue that doesn't demonize people.

185
0:10:44.96,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I'm going to ask you a question.

186
0:10:47.52,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I invite you to think about it when you get home and in the coming days,

187
0:10:51.84,000 --> 0:10:53,000
but you have to be honest with yourself.

188
0:10:54.56,000 --> 0:10:56,000
It should be easy, no one else will know it.

189
0:10:58.56,000 --> 0:10:59,000
The question is this ...

190
0:11:02.6,000 --> 0:11:03,000
who do you demonize?

191
0:11:06.6,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Do you think supporters of American President Trump are deplorables?

192
0:11:12.92,000 --> 0:11:17,000

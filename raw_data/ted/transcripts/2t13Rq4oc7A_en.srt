0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:15,000
In 1962 at Rice University,

2
0:00:16.76,000 --> 0:00:2,000
JFK told the country about a dream he had,

3
0:00:21.2,000 --> 0:00:24,000
a dream to put a person on the moon by the end of the decade.

4
0:00:25.12,000 --> 0:00:26,000
The eponymous moonshot.

5
0:00:28.12,000 --> 0:00:3,000
No one knew if it was possible to do

6
0:00:30.72,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but he made sure a plan was put in place to do it if it was possible.

7
0:00:35.56,000 --> 0:00:36,000
That's how great dreams are.

8
0:00:37.36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Great dreams aren't just visions,

9
0:00:39.84,000 --> 0:00:42,000
they're visions coupled to strategies for making them real.

10
0:00:44.08,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I have the incredible good fortune to work at a moonshot factory.

11
0:00:49.52,000 --> 0:00:51,000
At X -- formerly called Google X --

12
0:00:51.84,000 --> 0:00:55,000
you'll find an aerospace engineer working alongside a fashion designer

13
0:00:56.56,000 --> 0:01:,000
and former military ops commanders brainstorming with laser experts.

14
0:01:02.36,000 --> 0:01:07,000
These inventors, engineers and makers are dreaming up technologies

15
0:01:07.56,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that we hope can make the world a wonderful place.

16
0:01:12.2,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We use the word "moonshots" to remind us to keep our visions big --

17
0:01:16.76,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to keep dreaming.

18
0:01:18.48,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And we use the word "factory" to remind ourselves

19
0:01:22.96,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that we want to have concrete visions --

20
0:01:26.08,000 --> 0:01:29,000
concrete plans to make them real.

21
0:01:29.4,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Here's our moonshot blueprint.

22
0:01:31.36,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Number one:

23
0:01:32.6,000 --> 0:01:34,000
we want to find a huge problem in the world

24
0:01:35.04,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that affects many millions of people.

25
0:01:37.32,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Number two:

26
0:01:38.84,000 --> 0:01:41,000
we want to find or propose a radical solution for solving that problem.

27
0:01:43.48,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And then number three:

28
0:01:44.88,000 --> 0:01:46,000
there has to be some reason to believe

29
0:01:47.88,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that the technology for such a radical solution

30
0:01:50.96,000 --> 0:01:51,000
could actually be built.

31
0:01:53.88,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But I have a secret for you.

32
0:01:55.52,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The moonshot factory is a messy place.

33
0:01:59.6,000 --> 0:02:,000
But rather than avoid the mess,

34
0:02:01.44,000 --> 0:02:02,000
pretend it's not there,

35
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:04,000
we've tried to make that our strength.

36
0:02:06.08,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We spend most of our time breaking things

37
0:02:08.92,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and trying to prove that we're wrong.

38
0:02:12.32,000 --> 0:02:13,000
That's it, that's the secret.

39
0:02:14.68,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Run at all the hardest parts of the problem first.

40
0:02:18.24,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Get excited and cheer,

41
0:02:20.32,000 --> 0:02:22,000
"Hey! How are we going to kill our project today?"

42
0:02:25.92,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We've got this interesting balance going

43
0:02:29.56,000 --> 0:02:34,000
where we allow our unchecked optimism to fuel our visions.

44
0:02:35.12,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But then we also harness enthusiastic skepticism

45
0:02:39.6,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to breathe life, breathe reality into those visions.

46
0:02:43.32,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I want to show you a few of the projects

47
0:02:45.28,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that we've had to leave behind on the cutting room floor,

48
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and also a few of the gems

49
0:02:49.6,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that at least so far, have not only survived that process,

50
0:02:53.32,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but have been accelerated by it.

51
0:02:56.76,000 --> 0:03:,000
Last year we killed a project in automated vertical farming.

52
0:03:01.2,000 --> 0:03:03,000
This is some of the lettuce that we grew.

53
0:03:03.24,000 --> 0:03:06,000
One in nine people in the world suffers from undernourishment.

54
0:03:06.84,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So this is a moonshot that needs to happen.

55
0:03:09.96,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Vertical farming uses 10 times less water

56
0:03:12.64,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and a hundred times less land than conventional farming.

57
0:03:16.8,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And because you can grow the food close to where it's consumed,

58
0:03:22.2,000 --> 0:03:24,000
you don't have to transport it large distances.

59
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We made progress in a lot of the areas

60
0:03:29.48,000 --> 0:03:32,000
like automated harvesting and efficient lighting.

61
0:03:33.12,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But unfortunately,

62
0:03:34.6,000 --> 0:03:38,000
we couldn't get staple crops like grains and rice to grow this way.

63
0:03:38.68,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So we killed the project.

64
0:03:41.12,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Here's another huge problem.

65
0:03:43.24,000 --> 0:03:48,000
We pay enormous costs in resources and environmental damage

66
0:03:48.44,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to ship goods worldwide.

67
0:03:50.68,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Economic development of landlocked countries

68
0:03:53.28,000 --> 0:03:56,000
is limited by lack of shipping infrastructure.

69
0:03:56.88,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The radical solution?

70
0:03:58.52,000 --> 0:04:02,000
A lighter-than-air, variable-buoyancy cargo ship.

71
0:04:04.24,000 --> 0:04:07,000
This has the potential to lower,

72
0:04:07.64,000 --> 0:04:08,000
at least overall,

73
0:04:09.28,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the cost, time and carbon footprint of shipping

74
0:04:13.84,000 --> 0:04:14,000
without needing runways.

75
0:04:15.88,000 --> 0:04:18,000
We came up with this clever set of technical breakthroughs

76
0:04:18.96,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that together might make it possible for us to lower the cost enough

77
0:04:23.92,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that we could actually make these ships --

78
0:04:26.08,000 --> 0:04:27,000
inexpensively enough in volume.

79
0:04:28.76,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But however cheap they would have been to make in volume

80
0:04:33.32,000 --> 0:04:36,000
it turned out that it was going to cost close to 200 million dollars

81
0:04:37.2,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to design and build the first one.

82
0:04:40.68,000 --> 0:04:43,000
200 million dollars is just way too expensive.

83
0:04:44.36,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Because X is structured with these tight feedback loops

84
0:04:48.2,000 --> 0:04:51,000
of making mistakes and learning and new designs,

85
0:04:51.88,000 --> 0:04:52,000
we can't spend 200 million dollars

86
0:04:53.64,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to get the first data point

87
0:04:55.4,000 --> 0:04:57,000
about whether we're on the right track or not.

88
0:04:58.6,000 --> 0:05:,000
If there's an Achilles' heel in one our projects,

89
0:05:00.96,000 --> 0:05:04,000
we want to know it now, up front, not way down the road.

90
0:05:05.28,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So we killed this project, too.

91
0:05:08.88,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Discovering a major flaw in a project

92
0:05:11.64,000 --> 0:05:13,000
doesn't always mean that it ends the project.

93
0:05:13.8,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Sometimes it actually gets us onto a more productive path.

94
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:2,000
This is our fully self-driving vehicle prototype,

95
0:05:20.96,000 --> 0:05:23,000
which we built without a steering wheel or break pedal.

96
0:05:24.8,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But that wasn't actually our goal when we started.

97
0:05:27.76,000 --> 0:05:32,000
With 1.2 million people dying on the roads globally every year,

98
0:05:33.68,000 --> 0:05:36,000
building a car that drives itself was a natural moonshot to take.

99
0:05:37.52,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Three and a half years ago,

100
0:05:39.92,000 --> 0:05:44,000
when we had these Lexus, retrofitted, self-driving cars in testing,

101
0:05:45.52,000 --> 0:05:48,000
they were doing so well, we gave them out to other Googlers

102
0:05:49.2,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to find out what they thought of the experience.

103
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And what we discovered

104
0:05:53.28,000 --> 0:05:57,000
was that our plan to have the cars do almost all the driving

105
0:05:57.92,000 --> 0:06:,000
and just hand over to the users in case of emergency

106
0:06:01.84,000 --> 0:06:04,000
was a really bad plan.

107
0:06:06.2,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It wasn't safe

108
0:06:07.88,000 --> 0:06:1,000
because the users didn't do their job.

109
0:06:11.04,000 --> 0:06:12,000
They didn't stay alert

110
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
in case the car needed to hand control back to them.

111
0:06:17.24,000 --> 0:06:19,000
This was a major crisis for the team.

112
0:06:19.28,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It sent them back to the drawing board.

113
0:06:22.32,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And they came up with a beautiful, new perspective.

114
0:06:26.6,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Aim for a car where you're truly a passenger.

115
0:06:31.28,000 --> 0:06:33,000
You tell the car where you want to go,

116
0:06:33.56,000 --> 0:06:34,000
you push a button

117
0:06:34.84,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and it takes you from point A to point B by itself.

118
0:06:39.72,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We're really grateful

119
0:06:41.04,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that we had this insight as early on in the project as we did.

120
0:06:44.6,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And it's shaped everything we've done since then.

121
0:06:49.2,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And now our cars have self-driven more than 1.4 million miles,

122
0:06:55.56,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and they're out everyday

123
0:06:57.2,000 --> 0:07:01,000
on the streets of Mountain View, California and Austin, Texas.

124
0:07:02.12,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The cars team shifted their perspective.

125
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:08,000
This is one of X's mantras.

126
0:07:08.08,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Sometimes shifting your perspective is more powerful than being smart.

127
0:07:13.88,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Take wind energy.

128
0:07:15.4,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It's one of my favorite examples of perspective shifting.

129
0:07:18.76,000 --> 0:07:2,000
There's no way that we're going to build

130
0:07:21.64,000 --> 0:07:25,000
a better standard wind turbine than the experts in that industry.

131
0:07:26.72,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But we found a way to get up higher into the sky,

132
0:07:31.64,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and so get access to faster, more consistent winds,

133
0:07:35.48,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and so more energy without needing hundreds of tons of steel to get there.

134
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Our Makani energy kite rises up from its perch

135
0:07:44.52,000 --> 0:07:47,000
by spinning up those propellers along its wing.

136
0:07:47.56,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And it pulls out a tether as it rises,

137
0:07:50.64,000 --> 0:07:51,000
pulling energy up through the tether.

138
0:07:52.56,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Once the tether's all the way out,

139
0:07:54.44,000 --> 0:07:57,000
it goes into crosswind circles in the sky.

140
0:07:58.32,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And now those propellers that lifted it up have become flying turbines.

141
0:08:04.4,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And that sends energy back down the tether.

142
0:08:07.88,000 --> 0:08:09,000
We haven't yet found a way to kill this project.

143
0:08:10.76,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And the longer it survives that pressure, the more excited we get

144
0:08:14.88,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that this could become a cheaper and more deployable form

145
0:08:19.36,000 --> 0:08:2,000
of wind energy for the world.

146
0:08:23.08,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Probably the craziest sounding project we have is Project Loon.

147
0:08:27.32,000 --> 0:08:3,000
We're trying to make balloon-powered Internet.

148
0:08:30.88,000 --> 0:08:33,000
A network of balloons in the stratosphere

149
0:08:34.8,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that beam an internet connection down to rural and remote areas of the world.

150
0:08:39.92,000 --> 0:08:42,000
This could bring online as many as four billion more people,

151
0:08:43.84,000 --> 0:08:45,000
who today have little or no internet connection.

152
0:08:47.12,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But you can't just take a cell tower,

153
0:08:50.039,000 --> 0:08:52,000
strap it to a balloon and stick it in the sky.

154
0:08:52.96,000 --> 0:08:54,000
The winds are too strong, it would be blown away.

155
0:08:55.36,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And the balloons are too high up to tie it to the ground.

156
0:09:00.8,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Here comes the crazy moment.

157
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:05,000
What if, instead,

158
0:09:05.12,000 --> 0:09:07,000
we let the balloons drift

159
0:09:07.36,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and we taught them how to sail the winds to go where the needed to go?

160
0:09:13.56,000 --> 0:09:16,000
It turns out the stratosphere has winds

161
0:09:16.92,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that are going in quite different speeds and directions in thin strata.

162
0:09:21.04,000 --> 0:09:25,000
So we hoped that using smart algorithms and wind data from around the world,

163
0:09:26.8,000 --> 0:09:28,000
we could maneuver the balloons a bit,

164
0:09:29.28,000 --> 0:09:32,000
getting them to go up and down just a tiny bit in the stratosphere

165
0:09:32.4,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to grab those winds going in those different directions and speeds.

166
0:09:36.04,000 --> 0:09:38,000
The idea is to have enough balloons

167
0:09:38.36,000 --> 0:09:4,000
so as one balloon floats out of your area,

168
0:09:41.24,000 --> 0:09:44,000
there's another balloon ready to float into place,

169
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:47,000
handing off the internet connection,

170
0:09:47.64,000 --> 0:09:5,000
just like your phone hands off between cell towers

171
0:09:51.12,000 --> 0:09:52,000
as you drive down the freeway.

172
0:09:53.76,000 --> 0:09:57,000
We get how crazy that vision sounds --

173
0:09:58.2,000 --> 0:10:,000
there's the name of the project to remind us of that.

174
0:10:00.96,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So since 2012,

175
0:10:03.32,000 --> 0:10:08,000
the Loon team has prioritized the work that seems the most difficult

176
0:10:09.12,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and so the most likely to kill their project.

177
0:10:13.92,000 --> 0:10:14,000
The first thing that they did

178
0:10:15.48,000 --> 0:10:19,000
was try to get a Wi-Fi connection from a balloon in the stratosphere

179
0:10:19.72,000 --> 0:10:21,000
down to an antenna on the ground.

180
0:10:22.72,000 --> 0:10:23,000
It worked.

181
0:10:23.96,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And I promise you there were bets that it wasn't going to.

182
0:10:26.699,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So we kept going.

183
0:10:28.88,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Could we get the balloon to talk directly to handsets,

184
0:10:32.28,000 --> 0:10:35,000
so that we didn't need the antenna as an intermediary receiver?

185
0:10:36.72,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Yeah.

186
0:10:38.68,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Could we get the balloon bandwidth high enough

187
0:10:41.32,000 --> 0:10:43,000
so it was a real Internet connection?

188
0:10:44.08,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So that people could have something more than just SMS?

189
0:10:49.64,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The early tests weren't even a megabit per second,

190
0:10:53.48,000 --> 0:10:56,000
but now we can do up to 15 megabits per second.

191
0:10:56.92,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Enough to watch a TED Talk.

192
0:10:59.36,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Could we get the balloons to talk to each other through the sky

193
0:11:02.96,000 --> 0:11:06,000
so that we could reach our signal deeper into rural areas?

194
0:11:07.84,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Check.

195
0:11:09.4,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Could we get balloons the size of a house to stay up for more than 100 days,

196
0:11:16.08,000 --> 0:11:18,000
while costing less than five percent

197
0:11:18.4,000 --> 0:11:21,000
of what traditional, long-life balloons have cost to make?

198
0:11:23.64,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Yes. In the end.

199
0:11:25.56,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But I promise you, you name it, we had to try it to get there.

200
0:11:31.48,000 --> 0:11:33,000
We made round, silvery balloons.

201
0:11:35.2,000 --> 0:11:38,000
We made giant pillow-shaped balloons.

202
0:11:40.4,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We made balloons the size of a blue whale.

203
0:11:44.44,000 --> 0:11:46,000
We busted a lot of balloons.

204
0:11:47.4,000 --> 0:11:48,000
(Laughter)

205
0:11:49.04,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Since one of the things that was most likely to kill the Loon project

206
0:11:53.12,000 --> 0:11:56,000
was whether we could guide the balloons through the sky,

207
0:11:56.2,000 --> 0:12:,000
one of our most important experiments was putting a balloon inside a balloon.

208
0:12:02.28,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So there are two compartments here, one with air and then one with helium.

209
0:12:07.36,000 --> 0:12:1,000
The balloon pumps air in to make itself heavier,

210
0:12:11.24,000 --> 0:12:13,000
or lets air out to make it lighter.

211
0:12:14.52,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And these weight changes allow it to rise or fall,

212
0:12:17.84,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and that simple movement of the balloon is its steering mechanism.

213
0:12:21.6,000 --> 0:12:22,000
It floats up or down,

214
0:12:23.28,000 --> 0:12:26,000
hoping to grab winds going in the speed and direction that it wants.

215
0:12:27.92,000 --> 0:12:31,000
But is that good enough for it to navigate through the world?

216
0:12:32.8,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Barely at first,

217
0:12:35.36,000 --> 0:12:36,000
but better all the time.

218
0:12:36.76,000 --> 0:12:38,000
This particular balloon, our latest balloon,

219
0:12:39.68,000 --> 0:12:42,000
can navigate a two-mile vertical stretch of sky

220
0:12:44.28,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and can sail itself to within 500 meters of where it wants to go

221
0:12:48.36,000 --> 0:12:5,000
from 20,000 kilometers away.

222
0:12:56.36,000 --> 0:12:58,000
We have lots more to do

223
0:12:58.6,000 --> 0:13:02,000
in terms of fine-tuning the system and reducing costs.

224
0:13:03.2,000 --> 0:13:06,000
But last year, a balloon built inexpensively

225
0:13:06.24,000 --> 0:13:12,000
went around the world 19 times over 187 days.

226
0:13:12.4,000 --> 0:13:13,000
So we're going to keep going.

227
0:13:15.12,000 --> 0:13:18,000
(Applause)

228
0:13:21.52,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Our balloons today

229
0:13:22.8,000 --> 0:13:25,000
are doing pretty much everything a complete system needs to do.

230
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
We're in discussions with telcos around the world,

231
0:13:30.04,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and we're going to fly over places like Indonesia

232
0:13:32.4,000 --> 0:13:34,000
for real service testing this year.

233
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
This probably all sounds too good to be true,

234
0:13:38.8,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and you're right.

235
0:13:41.32,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Being audacious

236
0:13:43.08,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and working on big, risky things

237
0:13:45.76,000 --> 0:13:47,000
makes people inherently uncomfortable.

238
0:13:49.04,000 --> 0:13:54,000
You cannot yell at people and force them to fail fast.

239
0:13:55.44,000 --> 0:13:57,000
People resist. They worry.

240
0:13:57.56,000 --> 0:14:,000
"What will happen to me if I fail?

241
0:14:00.64,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Will people laugh at me?

242
0:14:02.88,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Will I be fired?"

243
0:14:05.88,000 --> 0:14:07,000
I started with our secret.

244
0:14:08.6,000 --> 0:14:1,000
I'm going to leave you with how we actually make it happen.

245
0:14:12.92,000 --> 0:14:17,000
The only way to get people to work on big, risky things --

246
0:14:17.96,000 --> 0:14:18,000
audacious ideas --

247
0:14:19.72,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and have them run at all the hardest parts of the problem first,

248
0:14:24.68,000 --> 0:14:27,000
is if you make that the path of least resistance for them.

249
0:14:29.36,000 --> 0:14:32,000
We work hard at X to make it safe to fail.

250
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Teams kill their ideas as soon as the evidence is on the table

251
0:14:37.96,000 --> 0:14:39,000
because they're rewarded for it.

252
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
They get applause from their peers.

253
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Hugs and high fives from their manager, me in particular.

254
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
They get promoted for it.

255
0:14:51.68,000 --> 0:14:57,000
We have bonused every single person on teams that ended their projects,

256
0:14:57.96,000 --> 0:15:,000
from teams as small as two to teams of more than 30.

257
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:03,000
We believe in dreams at the moonshot factory.

258
0:15:04.84,000 --> 0:15:06,000
But enthusiastic skepticism

259
0:15:07.36,000 --> 0:15:1,000
is not the enemy of boundless optimism.

260
0:15:10.84,000 --> 0:15:12,000
It's optimism's perfect partner.

261
0:15:14.28,000 --> 0:15:18,000
It unlocks the potential in every idea.

262
0:15:19.72,000 --> 0:15:22,000
We can create the future that's in our dreams.

263
0:15:24.4,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Thank you very much.

264
0:15:25.72,000 --> 0:15:31,000
(Applause)

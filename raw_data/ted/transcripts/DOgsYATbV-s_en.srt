1
0:00:12.618,000 --> 0:00:13,000
When I was born,

2
0:00:14.056,000 --> 0:00:15,000
there was really only one book

3
0:00:15.736,000 --> 0:00:16,000
about how to raise your children,

4
0:00:17.622,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and it was written by Dr. Spock.

5
0:00:20.789,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:22.725,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Thank you for indulging me.

7
0:00:23.956,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I have always wanted to do that.

8
0:00:27.562,000 --> 0:00:29,000
No, it was Benjamin Spock,

9
0:00:29.665,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and his book was called "The Common Sense Book of Baby And Child Care."

10
0:00:33.515,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It sold almost 50 million copies by the time he died.

11
0:00:39.162,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Today, I, as the mother of a six-year-old,

12
0:00:42.807,000 --> 0:00:43,000
walk into Barnes and Noble,

13
0:00:44.484,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and see this.

14
0:00:47.165,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And it is amazing

15
0:00:49.124,000 --> 0:00:52,000
the variety that one finds on those shelves.

16
0:00:52.828,000 --> 0:00:56,000
There are guides to raising an eco-friendly kid,

17
0:00:57.25,000 --> 0:00:59,000
a gluten-free kid,

18
0:00:59.445,000 --> 0:01:01,000
a disease-proof kid,

19
0:01:01.81,000 --> 0:01:04,000
which, if you ask me, is a little bit creepy.

20
0:01:05.763,000 --> 0:01:07,000
There are guides to raising a bilingual kid

21
0:01:08.3,000 --> 0:01:1,000
even if you only speak one language at home.

22
0:01:11.151,000 --> 0:01:14,000
There are guides to raising a financially savvy kid

23
0:01:14.767,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and a science-minded kid

24
0:01:17.529,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and a kid who is a whiz at yoga.

25
0:01:20.639,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Short of teaching your toddler how to defuse

26
0:01:23.849,000 --> 0:01:24,000
a nuclear bomb,

27
0:01:25.199,000 --> 0:01:31,000
there is pretty much a guide to everything.

28
0:01:31.705,000 --> 0:01:33,000
All of these books are well-intentioned.

29
0:01:34.319,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I am sure that many of them are great.

30
0:01:38.829,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But taken together, I am sorry,

31
0:01:42.93,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I do not see help

32
0:01:45.281,000 --> 0:01:48,000
when I look at that shelf.

33
0:01:49.13,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I see anxiety.

34
0:01:51.404,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I see a giant candy-colored monument

35
0:01:54.131,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to our collective panic,

36
0:01:57.074,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and it makes me want to know,

37
0:01:59.655,000 --> 0:02:01,000
why is it that raising our children

38
0:02:02.038,000 --> 0:02:03,000
is associated with so much anguish

39
0:02:03.82,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and so much confusion?

40
0:02:06.078,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Why is it that we are at sixes and sevens

41
0:02:08.792,000 --> 0:02:1,000
about the one thing human beings

42
0:02:11.768,000 --> 0:02:12,000
have been doing successfully for millennia,

43
0:02:13.632,000 --> 0:02:15,000
long before parenting message boards

44
0:02:16.468,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and peer-reviewed studies came along?

45
0:02:19.345,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Why is it that so many mothers and fathers

46
0:02:21.998,000 --> 0:02:27,000
experience parenthood as a kind of crisis?

47
0:02:28.22,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Crisis might seem like a strong word,

48
0:02:30.566,000 --> 0:02:32,000
but there is data suggesting it probably isn't.

49
0:02:33.544,000 --> 0:02:35,000
There was, in fact, a paper of just this very name,

50
0:02:36.3,000 --> 0:02:4,000
"Parenthood as Crisis," published in 1957,

51
0:02:40.386,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and in the 50-plus years since,

52
0:02:42.924,000 --> 0:02:44,000
there has been plenty of scholarship

53
0:02:45.01,000 --> 0:02:47,000
documenting a pretty clear pattern

54
0:02:47.417,000 --> 0:02:49,000
of parental anguish.

55
0:02:49.472,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Parents experience more stress than non-parents.

56
0:02:52.778,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Their marital satisfaction is lower.

57
0:02:55.694,000 --> 0:02:56,000
There have been a number of studies

58
0:02:57.211,000 --> 0:02:58,000
looking at how parents feel

59
0:02:58.5,000 --> 0:03:,000
when they are spending time with their kids,

60
0:03:00.917,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and the answer often is, not so great.

61
0:03:04.817,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Last year, I spoke with a researcher

62
0:03:06.855,000 --> 0:03:07,000
named Matthew Killingsworth

63
0:03:08.151,000 --> 0:03:11,000
who is doing a very, very imaginative project

64
0:03:11.611,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that tracks people's happiness,

65
0:03:13.509,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and here is what he told me he found:

66
0:03:17.478,000 --> 0:03:18,000
"Interacting with your friends

67
0:03:19.092,000 --> 0:03:21,000
is better than interacting with your spouse,

68
0:03:22.004,000 --> 0:03:25,000
which is better than interacting with other relatives,

69
0:03:25.36,000 --> 0:03:28,000
which is better than interacting with acquaintances,

70
0:03:28.585,000 --> 0:03:3,000
which is better than interacting with parents,

71
0:03:31.53,000 --> 0:03:34,000
which is better than interacting with children.

72
0:03:35.306,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Who are on par with strangers."

73
0:03:37.306,000 --> 0:03:41,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:41.812,000 --> 0:03:43,000
But here's the thing.

75
0:03:44.179,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I have been looking at what underlies these data

76
0:03:47.257,000 --> 0:03:48,000
for three years,

77
0:03:49.168,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and children are not the problem.

78
0:03:52.394,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Something about parenting right now at this moment

79
0:03:57.381,000 --> 0:03:59,000
is the problem.

80
0:03:59.421,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Specifically, I don't think we know

81
0:04:01.91,000 --> 0:04:03,000
what parenting is supposed to be.

82
0:04:04.426,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Parent, as a verb,

83
0:04:06.606,000 --> 0:04:1,000
only entered common usage in 1970.

84
0:04:10.868,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Our roles as mothers and fathers have changed.

85
0:04:14.19,000 --> 0:04:16,000
The roles of our children have changed.

86
0:04:17.031,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We are all now furiously improvising

87
0:04:19.373,000 --> 0:04:2,000
our way through a situation

88
0:04:21.279,000 --> 0:04:24,000
for which there is no script,

89
0:04:24.872,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and if you're an amazing jazz musician,

90
0:04:26.913,000 --> 0:04:28,000
then improv is great,

91
0:04:29.1,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but for the rest of us,

92
0:04:31.505,000 --> 0:04:34,000
it can kind of feel like a crisis.

93
0:04:35.321,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So how did we get here?

94
0:04:37.901,000 --> 0:04:39,000
How is it that we are all now navigating

95
0:04:40.017,000 --> 0:04:41,000
a child-rearing universe

96
0:04:41.569,000 --> 0:04:43,000
without any norms to guide us?

97
0:04:44.397,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Well, for starters, there has been

98
0:04:46.557,000 --> 0:04:47,000
a major historical change.

99
0:04:48.396,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Until fairly recently,

100
0:04:50.589,000 --> 0:04:53,000
kids worked, on our farms primarily,

101
0:04:54.301,000 --> 0:04:56,000
but also in factories, mills, mines.

102
0:04:57.169,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Kids were considered economic assets.

103
0:05:00.085,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Sometime during the Progressive Era,

104
0:05:02.181,000 --> 0:05:03,000
we put an end to this arrangement.

105
0:05:03.809,000 --> 0:05:05,000
We recognized kids had rights,

106
0:05:06.08,000 --> 0:05:07,000
we banned child labor,

107
0:05:07.6,000 --> 0:05:09,000
we focused on education instead,

108
0:05:10.37,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and school became a child's new work.

109
0:05:13.546,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And thank God it did.

110
0:05:15.252,000 --> 0:05:17,000
But that only made a parent's role

111
0:05:17.649,000 --> 0:05:18,000
more confusing in a way.

112
0:05:19.42,000 --> 0:05:2,000
The old arrangement might not have been

113
0:05:20.972,000 --> 0:05:23,000
particularly ethical, but it was reciprocal.

114
0:05:24.09,000 --> 0:05:26,000
We provided food, clothing, shelter,

115
0:05:26.446,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and moral instruction to our kids,

116
0:05:28.57,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and they in return provided income.

117
0:05:34.21,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Once kids stopped working,

118
0:05:36.178,000 --> 0:05:39,000
the economics of parenting changed.

119
0:05:39.482,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Kids became, in the words of one

120
0:05:42.054,000 --> 0:05:45,000
brilliant if totally ruthless sociologist,

121
0:05:45.496,000 --> 0:05:49,000
"economically worthless but emotionally priceless."

122
0:05:50.258,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Rather than them working for us,

123
0:05:52.649,000 --> 0:05:53,000
we began to work for them,

124
0:05:54.552,000 --> 0:05:55,000
because within only a matter of decades

125
0:05:56.412,000 --> 0:05:57,000
it became clear:

126
0:05:57.82,000 --> 0:05:59,000
if we wanted our kids to succeed,

127
0:06:00.19,000 --> 0:06:02,000
school was not enough.

128
0:06:03.183,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Today, extracurricular activities are a kid's new work,

129
0:06:07.98,000 --> 0:06:08,000
but that's work for us too,

130
0:06:09.737,000 --> 0:06:12,000
because we are the ones driving them to soccer practice.

131
0:06:12.92,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Massive piles of homework are a kid's new work,

132
0:06:15.783,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but that's also work for us,

133
0:06:17.351,000 --> 0:06:19,000
because we have to check it.

134
0:06:19.462,000 --> 0:06:21,000
About three years ago, a Texas woman

135
0:06:21.787,000 --> 0:06:22,000
told something to me

136
0:06:22.841,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that totally broke my heart.

137
0:06:26.12,000 --> 0:06:3,000
She said, almost casually,

138
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
"Homework is the new dinner."

139
0:06:34.594,000 --> 0:06:36,000
The middle class now pours all of its time

140
0:06:37.194,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and energy and resources into its kids,

141
0:06:40.636,000 --> 0:06:41,000
even though the middle class

142
0:06:41.989,000 --> 0:06:44,000
has less and less of those things to give.

143
0:06:45.602,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Mothers now spend more time with their children

144
0:06:48.886,000 --> 0:06:5,000
than they did in 1965,

145
0:06:51.269,000 --> 0:06:56,000
when most women were not even in the workforce.

146
0:06:56.663,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It would probably be easier for parents

147
0:06:58.775,000 --> 0:06:59,000
to do their new roles

148
0:07:00.166,000 --> 0:07:03,000
if they knew what they were preparing their kids for.

149
0:07:03.731,000 --> 0:07:05,000
This is yet another thing that makes modern parenting

150
0:07:06.175,000 --> 0:07:08,000
so very confounding.

151
0:07:08.245,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We have no clue what portion our wisdom, if any,

152
0:07:11.933,000 --> 0:07:12,000
is of use to our kids.

153
0:07:13.69,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The world is changing so rapidly,

154
0:07:15.123,000 --> 0:07:17,000
it's impossible to say.

155
0:07:17.326,000 --> 0:07:19,000
This was true even when I was young.

156
0:07:19.401,000 --> 0:07:22,000
When I was a kid, high school specifically,

157
0:07:22.425,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I was told that I would be at sea

158
0:07:24.409,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in the new global economy

159
0:07:26.194,000 --> 0:07:3,000
if I did not know Japanese.

160
0:07:30.7,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And with all due respect to the Japanese,

161
0:07:33.202,000 --> 0:07:35,000
it didn't turn out that way.

162
0:07:35.643,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Now there is a certain kind of middle-class parent

163
0:07:37.931,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that is obsessed with teaching their kids Mandarin,

164
0:07:40.635,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and maybe they're onto something,

165
0:07:43.245,000 --> 0:07:45,000
but we cannot know for sure.

166
0:07:45.98,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So, absent being able to anticipate the future,

167
0:07:48.609,000 --> 0:07:5,000
what we all do, as good parents,

168
0:07:51.234,000 --> 0:07:52,000
is try and prepare our kids

169
0:07:53.161,000 --> 0:07:56,000
for every possible kind of future,

170
0:07:56.209,000 --> 0:08:,000
hoping that just one of our efforts will pay off.

171
0:08:00.266,000 --> 0:08:01,000
We teach our kids chess,

172
0:08:02.194,000 --> 0:08:04,000
thinking maybe they will need analytical skills.

173
0:08:04.829,000 --> 0:08:06,000
We sign them up for team sports,

174
0:08:07.274,000 --> 0:08:1,000
thinking maybe they will need collaborative skills,

175
0:08:10.561,000 --> 0:08:12,000
you know, for when they go to Harvard Business School.

176
0:08:13.081,000 --> 0:08:16,000
We try and teach them to be financially savvy

177
0:08:16.31,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and science-minded and eco-friendly

178
0:08:19.767,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and gluten-free,

179
0:08:22.733,000 --> 0:08:23,000
though now is probably a good time to tell you

180
0:08:24.705,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that I was not eco-friendly and gluten-free as a child.

181
0:08:30.245,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef.

182
0:08:35.035,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And you know what? I'm doing okay.

183
0:08:37.212,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I pay my taxes.

184
0:08:39.625,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I hold down a steady job.

185
0:08:42.842,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I was even invited to speak at TED.

186
0:08:47.17,000 --> 0:08:48,000
But the presumption now is that

187
0:08:48.552,000 --> 0:08:51,000
what was good enough for me, or for my folks for that matter,

188
0:08:51.95,000 --> 0:08:52,000
isn't good enough anymore.

189
0:08:53.761,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So we all make a mad dash to that bookshelf,

190
0:08:57.425,000 --> 0:09:,000
because we feel like if we aren't trying everything,

191
0:09:00.737,000 --> 0:09:02,000
it's as if we're doing nothing

192
0:09:02.867,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and we're defaulting on our obligations to our kids.

193
0:09:08.204,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So it's hard enough to navigate our new roles

194
0:09:10.812,000 --> 0:09:11,000
as mothers and fathers.

195
0:09:12.334,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Now add to this problem something else:

196
0:09:14.78,000 --> 0:09:15,000
we are also navigating new roles

197
0:09:16.708,000 --> 0:09:17,000
as husbands and wives

198
0:09:18.312,000 --> 0:09:21,000
because most women today are in the workforce.

199
0:09:21.96,000 --> 0:09:22,000
This is another reason, I think,

200
0:09:23.49,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that parenthood feels like a crisis.

201
0:09:25.812,000 --> 0:09:27,000
We have no rules, no scripts, no norms

202
0:09:28.462,000 --> 0:09:3,000
for what to do when a child comes along

203
0:09:31.002,000 --> 0:09:34,000
now that both mom and dad are breadwinners.

204
0:09:34.193,000 --> 0:09:36,000
The writer Michael Lewis once put this

205
0:09:36.598,000 --> 0:09:37,000
very, very well.

206
0:09:37.835,000 --> 0:09:39,000
He said that the surest way

207
0:09:40.347,000 --> 0:09:41,000
for a couple to start fighting

208
0:09:42.142,000 --> 0:09:45,000
is for them to go out to dinner with another couple

209
0:09:45.17,000 --> 0:09:46,000
whose division of labor

210
0:09:46.355,000 --> 0:09:49,000
is ever so slightly different from theirs,

211
0:09:49.965,000 --> 0:09:52,000
because the conversation in the car on the way home

212
0:09:53.641,000 --> 0:09:55,000
goes something like this:

213
0:09:56.775,000 --> 0:10:,000
"So, did you catch that Dave is the one

214
0:10:01.408,000 --> 0:10:04,000
who walks them to school every morning?"

215
0:10:05.309,000 --> 0:10:08,000
(Laughter)

216
0:10:09.742,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Without scripts telling us who does what

217
0:10:12.257,000 --> 0:10:15,000
in this brave new world, couples fight,

218
0:10:15.306,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and both mothers and fathers each have

219
0:10:18.545,000 --> 0:10:19,000
their legitimate gripes.

220
0:10:20.475,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Mothers are much more likely

221
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to be multi-tasking when they are at home,

222
0:10:24.408,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and fathers, when they are at home,

223
0:10:26.619,000 --> 0:10:28,000
are much more likely to be mono-tasking.

224
0:10:29.578,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Find a guy at home, and odds are

225
0:10:32.146,000 --> 0:10:35,000
he is doing just one thing at a time.

226
0:10:35.907,000 --> 0:10:37,000
In fact, UCLA recently did a study

227
0:10:38.811,000 --> 0:10:4,000
looking at the most common configuration

228
0:10:41.344,000 --> 0:10:44,000
of family members in middle-class homes.

229
0:10:44.39,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Guess what it was?

230
0:10:46.123,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Dad in a room by himself.

231
0:10:48.77,000 --> 0:10:5,000
According to the American Time Use Survey,

232
0:10:51.21,000 --> 0:10:54,000
mothers still do twice as much childcare as fathers,

233
0:10:54.435,000 --> 0:10:57,000
which is better than it was in Erma Bombeck's day,

234
0:10:58.034,000 --> 0:11:,000
but I still think that something she wrote

235
0:11:00.3,000 --> 0:11:02,000
is highly relevant:

236
0:11:03.172,000 --> 0:11:06,000
"I have not been alone in the bathroom since October."

237
0:11:06.89,000 --> 0:11:1,000
(Laughter)

238
0:11:11.224,000 --> 0:11:15,000
But here is the thing: Men are doing plenty.

239
0:11:16.054,000 --> 0:11:17,000
They spend more time with their kids

240
0:11:17.83,000 --> 0:11:2,000
than their fathers ever spent with them.

241
0:11:21.164,000 --> 0:11:22,000
They work more paid hours, on average,

242
0:11:23.144,000 --> 0:11:24,000
than their wives,

243
0:11:24.837,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and they genuinely want to be good,

244
0:11:26.671,000 --> 0:11:27,000
involved dads.

245
0:11:28.25,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Today, it is fathers, not mothers,

246
0:11:31.618,000 --> 0:11:35,000
who report the most work-life conflict.

247
0:11:35.729,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Either way, by the way,

248
0:11:37.961,000 --> 0:11:39,000
if you think it's hard for traditional families

249
0:11:40.296,000 --> 0:11:41,000
to sort out these new roles,

250
0:11:41.92,000 --> 0:11:42,000
just imagine what it's like now

251
0:11:43.756,000 --> 0:11:44,000
for non-traditional families:

252
0:11:45.651,000 --> 0:11:47,000
families with two dads, families with two moms,

253
0:11:48.246,000 --> 0:11:49,000
single-parent households.

254
0:11:49.951,000 --> 0:11:53,000
They are truly improvising as they go.

255
0:11:54.344,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Now, in a more progressive country,

256
0:11:58.135,000 --> 0:12:,000
and forgive me here for capitulating to cliché

257
0:12:00.865,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and invoking, yes, Sweden,

258
0:12:03.919,000 --> 0:12:05,000
parents could rely on the state

259
0:12:06.84,000 --> 0:12:08,000
for support.

260
0:12:09.489,000 --> 0:12:1,000
There are countries that acknowledge

261
0:12:11.368,000 --> 0:12:12,000
the anxieties and the changing roles

262
0:12:12.801,000 --> 0:12:14,000
of mothers and fathers.

263
0:12:15.165,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Unfortunately, the United States is not one of them,

264
0:12:18.429,000 --> 0:12:19,000
so in case you were wondering what the U.S.

265
0:12:20.394,000 --> 0:12:25,000
has in common with Papua New Guinea and Liberia,

266
0:12:25.697,000 --> 0:12:28,000
it's this:

267
0:12:28.728,000 --> 0:12:31,000
We too have no paid maternity leave policy.

268
0:12:32.455,000 --> 0:12:39,000
We are one of eight known countries that does not.

269
0:12:39.702,000 --> 0:12:42,000
In this age of intense confusion,

270
0:12:43.273,000 --> 0:12:46,000
there is just one goal upon which

271
0:12:46.675,000 --> 0:12:47,000
all parents can agree,

272
0:12:48.507,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and that is whether they are

273
0:12:49.971,000 --> 0:12:53,000
tiger moms or hippie moms, helicopters or drones,

274
0:12:54.537,000 --> 0:12:58,000
our kids' happiness is paramount.

275
0:12:58.678,000 --> 0:12:59,000
That is what it means

276
0:13:00.56,000 --> 0:13:02,000
to raise kids in an age

277
0:13:03.01,000 --> 0:13:05,000
when they are economically worthless

278
0:13:05.235,000 --> 0:13:07,000
but emotionally priceless.

279
0:13:07.48,000 --> 0:13:1,000
We are all the custodians of their self-esteem.

280
0:13:10.88,000 --> 0:13:13,000
The one mantra no parent ever questions is,

281
0:13:14.713,000 --> 0:13:19,000
"All I want is for my children to be happy."

282
0:13:20.444,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And don't get me wrong:

283
0:13:22.157,000 --> 0:13:26,000
I think happiness is a wonderful goal for a child.

284
0:13:27.037,000 --> 0:13:3,000
But it is a very elusive one.

285
0:13:30.743,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Happiness and self-confidence,

286
0:13:34.683,000 --> 0:13:35,000
teaching children that is not like teaching them

287
0:13:36.664,000 --> 0:13:37,000
how to plow a field.

288
0:13:38.18,000 --> 0:13:4,000
It's not like teaching them how to ride a bike.

289
0:13:40.881,000 --> 0:13:42,000
There's no curriculum for it.

290
0:13:43.438,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Happiness and self-confidence can be the byproducts of other things,

291
0:13:47.035,000 --> 0:13:5,000
but they cannot really be goals unto themselves.

292
0:13:50.09,000 --> 0:13:51,000
A child's happiness

293
0:13:51.756,000 --> 0:13:54,000
is a very unfair burden to place on a parent.

294
0:13:55.521,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And happiness is an even more unfair burden

295
0:13:58.359,000 --> 0:14:,000
to place on a kid.

296
0:14:01.199,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And I have to tell you,

297
0:14:03.222,000 --> 0:14:06,000
I think it leads to some very strange excesses.

298
0:14:07.104,000 --> 0:14:09,000
We are now so anxious

299
0:14:09.506,000 --> 0:14:12,000
to protect our kids from the world's ugliness

300
0:14:12.824,000 --> 0:14:16,000
that we now shield them from "Sesame Street."

301
0:14:17.576,000 --> 0:14:19,000
I wish I could say I was kidding about this,

302
0:14:19.712,000 --> 0:14:21,000
but if you go out and you buy

303
0:14:22.384,000 --> 0:14:24,000
the first few episodes of "Sesame Street" on DVD,

304
0:14:25.323,000 --> 0:14:28,000
as I did out of nostalgia,

305
0:14:28.404,000 --> 0:14:31,000
you will find a warning at the beginning

306
0:14:31.517,000 --> 0:14:33,000
saying that the content is not suitable

307
0:14:34.147,000 --> 0:14:35,000
for children.

308
0:14:35.915,000 --> 0:14:37,000
(Laughter)

309
0:14:38.025,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Can I just repeat that?

310
0:14:39.23,000 --> 0:14:41,000
The content of the original "Sesame Street"

311
0:14:41.861,000 --> 0:14:44,000
is not suitable for children.

312
0:14:45.203,000 --> 0:14:48,000
When asked about this by The New York Times,

313
0:14:48.845,000 --> 0:14:51,000
a producer for the show gave a variety of explanations.

314
0:14:52.15,000 --> 0:14:54,000
One was that Cookie Monster smoked a pipe

315
0:14:54.909,000 --> 0:14:55,000
in one skit and then swallowed it.

316
0:14:56.67,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Bad modeling. I don't know.

317
0:14:58.105,000 --> 0:15:,000
But the thing that stuck with me

318
0:15:01.087,000 --> 0:15:03,000
is she said that she didn't know

319
0:15:03.542,000 --> 0:15:07,000
whether Oscar the Grouch could be invented today

320
0:15:07.881,000 --> 0:15:11,000
because he was too depressive.

321
0:15:12.779,000 --> 0:15:14,000
I cannot tell you how much this distresses me.

322
0:15:15.187,000 --> 0:15:16,000
(Laughter)

323
0:15:16.706,000 --> 0:15:17,000
You are looking at a woman

324
0:15:18.559,000 --> 0:15:21,000
who has a periodic table of the Muppets

325
0:15:21.603,000 --> 0:15:24,000
hanging from her cubicle wall.

326
0:15:25.395,000 --> 0:15:28,000
The offending muppet, right there.

327
0:15:30.239,000 --> 0:15:34,000
That's my son the day he was born.

328
0:15:35.025,000 --> 0:15:37,000
I was high as a kite on morphine.

329
0:15:37.217,000 --> 0:15:4,000
I had had an unexpected C-section.

330
0:15:41.08,000 --> 0:15:44,000
But even in my opiate haze,

331
0:15:44.596,000 --> 0:15:46,000
I managed to have one very clear thought

332
0:15:47.529,000 --> 0:15:49,000
the first time I held him.

333
0:15:50.481,000 --> 0:15:51,000
I whispered it into his ear.

334
0:15:52.385,000 --> 0:16:,000
I said, "I will try so hard not to hurt you."

335
0:16:01.269,000 --> 0:16:02,000
It was the Hippocratic Oath,

336
0:16:02.589,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and I didn't even know I was saying it.

337
0:16:06.467,000 --> 0:16:08,000
But it occurs to me now

338
0:16:08.791,000 --> 0:16:1,000
that the Hippocratic Oath

339
0:16:10.87,000 --> 0:16:14,000
is a much more realistic aim than happiness.

340
0:16:15.202,000 --> 0:16:18,000
In fact, as any parent will tell you,

341
0:16:18.802,000 --> 0:16:2,000
it's awfully hard.

342
0:16:21.57,000 --> 0:16:25,000
All of us have said or done hurtful things

343
0:16:26.424,000 --> 0:16:31,000
that we wish to God we could take back.

344
0:16:32.398,000 --> 0:16:34,000
I think in another era

345
0:16:35.246,000 --> 0:16:38,000
we did not expect quite so much from ourselves,

346
0:16:39.238,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and it is important that we all remember that

347
0:16:42.92,000 --> 0:16:45,000
the next time we are staring with our hearts racing

348
0:16:46.754,000 --> 0:16:5,000
at those bookshelves.

349
0:16:52.254,000 --> 0:16:55,000
I'm not really sure how to create new norms

350
0:16:55.508,000 --> 0:16:56,000
for this world,

351
0:16:57.186,000 --> 0:17:,000
but I do think that

352
0:17:00.27,000 --> 0:17:03,000
in our desperate quest to create happy kids,

353
0:17:03.588,000 --> 0:17:06,000
we may be assuming the wrong moral burden.

354
0:17:06.615,000 --> 0:17:07,000
It strikes me as a better goal,

355
0:17:08.333,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and, dare I say, a more virtuous one,

356
0:17:10.549,000 --> 0:17:12,000
to focus on making productive kids

357
0:17:13.268,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and moral kids,

358
0:17:14.608,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and to simply hope that happiness will come to them

359
0:17:16.924,000 --> 0:17:18,000
by virtue of the good that they do

360
0:17:19.67,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and their accomplishments

361
0:17:21.898,000 --> 0:17:23,000
and the love that they feel from us.

362
0:17:24.796,000 --> 0:17:29,000
That, anyway, is one response to having no script.

363
0:17:30.429,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Absent having new scripts,

364
0:17:33.762,000 --> 0:17:36,000
we just follow the oldest ones in the book --

365
0:17:37.447,000 --> 0:17:42,000
decency, a work ethic, love —

366
0:17:43.046,000 --> 0:17:47,000
and let happiness and self-esteem take care of themselves.

367
0:17:47.37,000 --> 0:17:49,000
I think if we all did that,

368
0:17:49.414,000 --> 0:17:52,000
the kids would still be all right,

369
0:17:52.955,000 --> 0:17:54,000
and so would their parents,

370
0:17:55.601,000 --> 0:17:58,000
possibly in both cases even better.

371
0:17:59.569,000 --> 0:18:,000
Thank you.

372
0:18:01.448,000 --> 0:18:05,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.823,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So I come from the tallest people on the planet --

2
0:00:15.215,000 --> 0:00:16,000
the Dutch.

3
0:00:17.383,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It hasn't always been this way.

4
0:00:19.093,000 --> 0:00:22,000
In fact, all across the globe, people have been gaining height.

5
0:00:22.331,000 --> 0:00:23,000
In the last 150 years,

6
0:00:23.918,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in developed countries,

7
0:00:25.103,000 --> 0:00:27,000
on average, we have gotten 10 centimeters taller.

8
0:00:28.139,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And scientists have a lot of theories about why this is,

9
0:00:30.942,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but almost all of them involve nutrition,

10
0:00:33.386,000 --> 0:00:35,000
namely the increase of dairy and meat.

11
0:00:36.432,000 --> 0:00:37,000
In the last 50 years,

12
0:00:37.964,000 --> 0:00:39,000
global meat consumption has more than quadrupled,

13
0:00:40.862,000 --> 0:00:43,000
from 71 million tons to 310 million tons.

14
0:00:44.705,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Something similar has been going on with milk and eggs.

15
0:00:48.46,000 --> 0:00:52,000
In every society where incomes have risen, so has protein consumption.

16
0:00:53.053,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And we know that globally, we are getting richer.

17
0:00:56.006,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And as the middle class is on the rise, so is our global population,

18
0:00:59.235,000 --> 0:01:03,000
from 7 billion of us today to 9.7 billion by 2050,

19
0:01:04.21,000 --> 0:01:05,000
which means that by 2050,

20
0:01:05.697,000 --> 0:01:07,000
we are going to need at least 70 percent more protein

21
0:01:08.248,000 --> 0:01:1,000
than what is available to humankind today.

22
0:01:11.322,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And the latest prediction of the UN puts that population number,

23
0:01:14.365,000 --> 0:01:16,000
by the end of this century, at 11 billion,

24
0:01:16.849,000 --> 0:01:18,000
which means that we are going to need a lot more protein.

25
0:01:21.027,000 --> 0:01:22,000
This challenge is staggering --

26
0:01:22.59,000 --> 0:01:23,000
so much so, that recently,

27
0:01:24.421,000 --> 0:01:27,000
a team at Anglia Ruskin Global Sustainability Institute suggested

28
0:01:27.563,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that if we don't change our global policies

29
0:01:29.723,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and food production systems,

30
0:01:31.295,000 --> 0:01:34,000
our societies might actually collapse in the next 30 years.

31
0:01:36.143,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Currently, our ocean serves as the main source of animal protein.

32
0:01:40.487,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Over 2.6 billion people depend on it every single day.

33
0:01:45.177,000 --> 0:01:46,000
At the same time,

34
0:01:46.384,000 --> 0:01:48,000
our global fisheries are two-and-a-half times larger

35
0:01:49.059,000 --> 0:01:51,000
than what our oceans can sustainably support,

36
0:01:51.607,000 --> 0:01:53,000
meaning that humans take far more fish from the ocean

37
0:01:54.353,000 --> 0:01:56,000
than the oceans can naturally replace.

38
0:01:56.681,000 --> 0:02:,000
WWF recently published a report showing that just in the last 40 years,

39
0:02:01.497,000 --> 0:02:03,000
our global marine life has been slashed in half.

40
0:02:04.595,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And another recent report suggests that of our largest predatory species,

41
0:02:09.322,000 --> 0:02:11,000
such as swordfish and bluefin tuna,

42
0:02:11.694,000 --> 0:02:14,000
over 90 percent has disappeared since the 1950s.

43
0:02:15.653,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And there are a lot of great, sustainable fishing initiatives across the planet

44
0:02:19.45,000 --> 0:02:22,000
working towards better practices and better-managed fisheries.

45
0:02:23.08,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But ultimately,

46
0:02:24.255,000 --> 0:02:27,000
all of these initiatives are working towards keeping current catch constant.

47
0:02:28.564,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It's unlikely,

48
0:02:29.739,000 --> 0:02:3,000
even with the best-managed fisheries,

49
0:02:31.553,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that we are going to be able to take much more from the ocean

50
0:02:34.54,000 --> 0:02:35,000
than we do today.

51
0:02:35.719,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We have to stop plundering our oceans the way we have.

52
0:02:38.488,000 --> 0:02:4,000
We need to alleviate the pressure on it.

53
0:02:40.67,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And we are at a point

54
0:02:42.012,000 --> 0:02:44,000
where if we push much harder for more produce,

55
0:02:44.801,000 --> 0:02:45,000
we might face total collapse.

56
0:02:47.226,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Our current systems are not going to feed a growing global population.

57
0:02:52.86,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So how do we fix this?

58
0:02:54.153,000 --> 0:02:56,000
What's the world going to look like in just 35 short years

59
0:02:56.915,000 --> 0:02:59,000
when there's 2.7 billion more of us sharing the same resources?

60
0:03:01.059,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We could all become vegan.

61
0:03:02.955,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Sounds like a great idea,

62
0:03:04.732,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but it's not realistic

63
0:03:06.06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and it's impossibly hard to mandate globally.

64
0:03:08.977,000 --> 0:03:11,000
People are eating animal protein whether we like it or not.

65
0:03:12.564,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And suppose we fail to change our ways

66
0:03:14.42,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and continue on the current path,

67
0:03:16.57,000 --> 0:03:17,000
failing to meet demands.

68
0:03:18.428,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The World Health Organization recently reported

69
0:03:20.674,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that 800 million people are suffering from malnutrition and food shortage,

70
0:03:24.86,000 --> 0:03:27,000
which is due to that same growing, global population

71
0:03:28.295,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and the declining access to resources like water, energy and land.

72
0:03:33.212,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It takes very little imagination

73
0:03:35.296,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to picture a world of global unrest, riots and further malnutrition.

74
0:03:40.27,000 --> 0:03:41,000
People are hungry,

75
0:03:41.92,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and we are running dangerously low on natural resources.

76
0:03:45.328,000 --> 0:03:46,000
For so, so many reasons,

77
0:03:46.908,000 --> 0:03:48,000
we need to change our global food production systems.

78
0:03:50.255,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We must do better

79
0:03:51.703,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and there is a solution.

80
0:03:52.892,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And that solution lies in aquaculture --

81
0:03:55.501,000 --> 0:03:58,000
the farming of fish, plants like seaweed, shellfish and crustaceans.

82
0:03:59.861,000 --> 0:04:01,000
As the great ocean hero Jacques Cousteau once said,

83
0:04:02.314,000 --> 0:04:04,000
"We must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters.

84
0:04:05.212,000 --> 0:04:08,000
That's what civilization is all about -- farming instead of hunting."

85
0:04:09.402,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Fish is the last food that we hunt.

86
0:04:12.374,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And why is it that we keep hearing phrases like,

87
0:04:15.706,000 --> 0:04:16,000
"Life's too short for farmed fish,"

88
0:04:17.413,000 --> 0:04:18,000
or, "Wild-caught, of course!"

89
0:04:19.025,000 --> 0:04:21,000
over fish that we know virtually nothing about?

90
0:04:21.398,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We don't know what it ate during its lifetime,

91
0:04:23.633,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and we don't know what pollution it encounters.

92
0:04:25.829,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And if it was a large predatory species,

93
0:04:27.773,000 --> 0:04:29,000
it might have gone through the coast of Fukushima yesterday.

94
0:04:30.626,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We don't know.

95
0:04:31.994,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Very few people realize

96
0:04:33.361,000 --> 0:04:36,000
the traceability in fisheries never goes beyond the hunter

97
0:04:37.027,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that caught the wild animal.

98
0:04:38.566,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But let's back up for a second

99
0:04:40.027,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and talk about why fish is the best food choice.

100
0:04:42.638,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It's healthy,

101
0:04:43.813,000 --> 0:04:44,000
it prevents heart disease,

102
0:04:45.093,000 --> 0:04:46,000
it provides key amino acids

103
0:04:46.56,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and key fatty acids like Omega-3s,

104
0:04:49.337,000 --> 0:04:51,000
which is very different from almost any other type of meat.

105
0:04:52.238,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And aside from being healthy,

106
0:04:53.872,000 --> 0:04:55,000
it's also a lot more exciting and diverse.

107
0:04:56.493,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Think about it -- most animal farming is pretty monotonous.

108
0:04:59.7,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Cow is cow, sheep is sheep, pig's pig,

109
0:05:02.375,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and poultry -- turkey, duck, chicken -- pretty much sums it up.

110
0:05:06.476,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And then there's 500 species of fish being farmed currently.

111
0:05:11.315,000 --> 0:05:13,000
not that Western supermarkets reflect that on their shelves,

112
0:05:14.267,000 --> 0:05:15,000
but that's beside that point.

113
0:05:15.688,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And you can farm fish in a very healthy manner

114
0:05:18.479,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that's good for us, good for the planet and good for the fish.

115
0:05:22.062,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I know I sound fish-obsessed --

116
0:05:24.022,000 --> 0:05:26,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:26.172,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Let me explain:

118
0:05:27.347,000 --> 0:05:3,000
My brilliant partner and wife, Amy Novograntz, and I got involved

119
0:05:30.53,000 --> 0:05:31,000
in aquaculture a couple of years ago.

120
0:05:32.505,000 --> 0:05:34,000
We were inspired by Sylvia Earle,

121
0:05:34.801,000 --> 0:05:36,000
who won the TED Prize in 2009.

122
0:05:37.121,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We actually met on Mission Blue I in the Galapagos.

123
0:05:41.157,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Amy was there as the TED Prize Director;

124
0:05:43.118,000 --> 0:05:46,000
me, an entrepreneur from the Netherlands and concerned citizen,

125
0:05:46.332,000 --> 0:05:48,000
love to dive, passion for the oceans.

126
0:05:49.292,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Mission Blue truly changed our lives.

127
0:05:51.65,000 --> 0:05:52,000
We fell in love,

128
0:05:52.825,000 --> 0:05:53,000
got married

129
0:05:54.325,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and we came away really inspired,

130
0:05:56.59,000 --> 0:05:59,000
thinking we really want to do something about ocean conservation --

131
0:05:59.823,000 --> 0:06:,000
something that was meant to last,

132
0:06:01.582,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that could make a real difference

133
0:06:04.162,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and something that we could do together.

134
0:06:07.741,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Little did we expect that that would lead us to fish farming.

135
0:06:11.741,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But a few months after we got off the boat,

136
0:06:13.863,000 --> 0:06:15,000
we got to a meeting at Conservation International,

137
0:06:16.421,000 --> 0:06:2,000
where the Director General of WorldFish was talking about aquaculture,

138
0:06:20.472,000 --> 0:06:23,000
asking a room full of environmentalists to stop turning from it,

139
0:06:24.242,000 --> 0:06:25,000
realize what was going on

140
0:06:26.027,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and to really get involved

141
0:06:27.472,000 --> 0:06:29,000
because aquaculture has the potential

142
0:06:29.608,000 --> 0:06:32,000
to be just what our oceans and populations need.

143
0:06:33.184,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We were stunned when we heard the stats

144
0:06:35.091,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that we didn't know more about this industry already

145
0:06:37.651,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and excited about the chance to help get it right.

146
0:06:41.042,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And to talk about stats --

147
0:06:42.813,000 --> 0:06:44,000
right now, the amount of fish consumed globally,

148
0:06:45.613,000 --> 0:06:47,000
wild catch and farmed combined,

149
0:06:47.693,000 --> 0:06:49,000
is twice the tonnage of the total amount of beef

150
0:06:50.049,000 --> 0:06:51,000
produced on planet earth last year.

151
0:06:52.439,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Every single fishing vessel combined,

152
0:06:54.77,000 --> 0:06:55,000
small and large, across the globe,

153
0:06:56.725,000 --> 0:06:59,000
together produce about 65 million tons of wild-caught seafood

154
0:07:00.626,000 --> 0:07:01,000
for human consumption.

155
0:07:02.623,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Aquaculture this year,

156
0:07:03.953,000 --> 0:07:04,000
for the first time in history,

157
0:07:05.556,000 --> 0:07:07,000
actually produces more than what we catch from the wild.

158
0:07:08.874,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But now this:

159
0:07:10.049,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Demand is going to go up.

160
0:07:12.157,000 --> 0:07:13,000
In the next 35 years,

161
0:07:13.69,000 --> 0:07:17,000
we are going to need an additional 85 million tons to meet demand,

162
0:07:18.709,000 --> 0:07:2,000
which is one-and-a-half times as much, almost,

163
0:07:21.328,000 --> 0:07:23,000
as what we catch globally out of our oceans.

164
0:07:25.14,000 --> 0:07:26,000
An enormous number.

165
0:07:26.812,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It's safe to assume that that's not going to come from the ocean.

166
0:07:29.935,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It needs to come from farming.

167
0:07:32.163,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And talk about farming --

168
0:07:33.502,000 --> 0:07:34,000
for farming you need resources.

169
0:07:36.313,000 --> 0:07:38,000
As a human needs to eat to grow and stay alive,

170
0:07:39.266,000 --> 0:07:4,000
so does an animal.

171
0:07:40.763,000 --> 0:07:42,000
A cow needs to eat eight to nine pounds of feed

172
0:07:43.682,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and drink almost 8,000 liters of water

173
0:07:46.157,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to create just one pound of meat.

174
0:07:48.535,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Experts agree that it's impossible

175
0:07:50.602,000 --> 0:07:53,000
to farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet.

176
0:07:53.778,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We just don't have enough feed or water.

177
0:07:56.54,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And we can't keep cutting down rain forests for it.

178
0:07:59.318,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And fresh water -- planet earth has a very limited supply.

179
0:08:02.851,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We need something more efficient

180
0:08:04.986,000 --> 0:08:06,000
to keep humankind alive on this planet.

181
0:08:08.517,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And now let's compare that with fish farming.

182
0:08:11.164,000 --> 0:08:14,000
You can farm one pound of fish with just one pound of feed,

183
0:08:15.126,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and depending on species, even less.

184
0:08:17.845,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And why is that?

185
0:08:20.099,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Well, that's because fish, first of all, float.

186
0:08:22.892,000 --> 0:08:25,000
They don't need to stand around all day resisting gravity like we do.

187
0:08:26.806,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And most fish are cold-blooded --

188
0:08:28.584,000 --> 0:08:29,000
they don't need to heat themselves.

189
0:08:30.288,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Fish chills.

190
0:08:31.48,000 --> 0:08:32,000
(Laughter)

191
0:08:33.125,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And it needs very little water,

192
0:08:34.689,000 --> 0:08:35,000
which is counterintuitive,

193
0:08:35.991,000 --> 0:08:36,000
but as we say,

194
0:08:37.402,000 --> 0:08:39,000
it swims in it but it hardly drinks it.

195
0:08:39.82,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Fish are the most resource-efficient animal protein available to humankind,

196
0:08:44.257,000 --> 0:08:45,000
aside from insects.

197
0:08:47.297,000 --> 0:08:48,000
How much we've learned since.

198
0:08:49.482,000 --> 0:08:52,000
For example, on top of that 65 million tons that's annually caught

199
0:08:52.943,000 --> 0:08:53,000
for human consumption,

200
0:08:54.577,000 --> 0:08:57,000
there's an additional 30 million tons caught for animal feed,

201
0:08:58.588,000 --> 0:09:01,000
mostly sardines and anchovies for the aquaculture industry

202
0:09:02.153,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that's turned into fish meal and fish oil.

203
0:09:04.602,000 --> 0:09:05,000
This is madness.

204
0:09:06.548,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Sixty-five percent of these fisheries, globally, are badly managed.

205
0:09:10.144,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Some of the worst issues of our time are connected to it.

206
0:09:12.878,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It's destroying our oceans.

207
0:09:14.2,000 --> 0:09:17,000
The worst slavery issues imaginable are connected to it.

208
0:09:17.702,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Recently, an article came out of Stanford

209
0:09:20.536,000 --> 0:09:22,000
saying that if 50 percent of the world's aquaculture industry

210
0:09:23.433,000 --> 0:09:24,000
would stop using fish meal,

211
0:09:24.759,000 --> 0:09:25,000
our oceans would be saved.

212
0:09:26.837,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Now think about that for a minute.

213
0:09:28.516,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Now, we know that the oceans have far more problems --

214
0:09:31.56,000 --> 0:09:33,000
they have pollution, there's acidification,

215
0:09:34.369,000 --> 0:09:35,000
coral reef destruction and so on.

216
0:09:35.976,000 --> 0:09:37,000
But it underlines the impact of our fisheries,

217
0:09:38.537,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and it underlines how interconnected everything is.

218
0:09:41.608,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Fisheries, aquaculture, deforestation,

219
0:09:45.248,000 --> 0:09:48,000
climate change, food security and so on.

220
0:09:48.834,000 --> 0:09:49,000
In the search for alternatives,

221
0:09:50.36,000 --> 0:09:52,000
the industry, on a massive scale,

222
0:09:52.439,000 --> 0:09:54,000
has reverted to plant-based alternatives

223
0:09:54.626,000 --> 0:09:56,000
like soy, industrial chicken waste,

224
0:09:57.503,000 --> 0:09:58,000
blood meal from slaughterhouses

225
0:09:59.369,000 --> 0:10:,000
and so on.

226
0:10:00.648,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And we understand where these choices come from,

227
0:10:03.136,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but this is not the right approach.

228
0:10:05.289,000 --> 0:10:06,000
It's not sustainable,

229
0:10:06.568,000 --> 0:10:07,000
it's not healthy.

230
0:10:07.766,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Have you ever seen a chicken at the bottom of the ocean?

231
0:10:10.453,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Of course not.

232
0:10:11.828,000 --> 0:10:13,000
If you feed salmon soy with nothing else,

233
0:10:14.048,000 --> 0:10:15,000
it literally explodes.

234
0:10:16.463,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Salmon is a carnivore,

235
0:10:17.639,000 --> 0:10:18,000
it has no way to digest soy.

236
0:10:21.049,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Now, fish farming is by far

237
0:10:23.195,000 --> 0:10:25,000
the best animal farming available to humankind.

238
0:10:25.536,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But it's had a really bad reputation.

239
0:10:28.373,000 --> 0:10:3,000
There's been excessive use of chemicals,

240
0:10:30.576,000 --> 0:10:33,000
there's been virus and disease transfered to wild populations,

241
0:10:33.78,000 --> 0:10:35,000
ecosystem destruction and pollution,

242
0:10:36.133,000 --> 0:10:38,000
escaped fish breeding with wild populations,

243
0:10:38.371,000 --> 0:10:4,000
altering the overall genetic pool,

244
0:10:40.395,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and then of course, as just mentioned,

245
0:10:42.885,000 --> 0:10:44,000
the unsustainable feed ingredients.

246
0:10:45.396,000 --> 0:10:46,000
How blessed were the days

247
0:10:46.663,000 --> 0:10:48,000
when we could just enjoy food that was on our plate,

248
0:10:49.134,000 --> 0:10:5,000
whatever it was.

249
0:10:50.825,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Once you know, you know.

250
0:10:52.388,000 --> 0:10:53,000
You can't go back.

251
0:10:53.618,000 --> 0:10:54,000
It's not fun.

252
0:10:54.793,000 --> 0:10:57,000
We really need a transparent food system that we can trust,

253
0:10:58.006,000 --> 0:10:59,000
that produces healthy food.

254
0:11:00.726,000 --> 0:11:01,000
But the good news is

255
0:11:01.949,000 --> 0:11:03,000
that decades of development and research

256
0:11:04.886,000 --> 0:11:06,000
have led to a lot of new technologies and knowledge

257
0:11:07.372,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that allow us to do a lot better.

258
0:11:09.208,000 --> 0:11:11,000
We can now farm fish without any of these issues.

259
0:11:12.548,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I think of agriculture before the green revolution --

260
0:11:15.453,000 --> 0:11:18,000
we are at aquaculture and the blue revolution.

261
0:11:19.817,000 --> 0:11:2,000
New technologies means

262
0:11:21.078,000 --> 0:11:24,000
that we can now produce a feed that's perfectly natural,

263
0:11:24.67,000 --> 0:11:25,000
with a minimal footprint

264
0:11:25.878,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that consists of microbes, insects, seaweeds and micro-algae.

265
0:11:30.689,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Healthy for the people,

266
0:11:32.016,000 --> 0:11:33,000
healthy for the fish,

267
0:11:33.191,000 --> 0:11:34,000
healthy for the planet.

268
0:11:35.293,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Microbes, for example,

269
0:11:36.467,000 --> 0:11:38,000
can be a perfect alternative for high-grade fish meal --

270
0:11:39.34,000 --> 0:11:4,000
at scale.

271
0:11:40.801,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Insects are the --

272
0:11:42.908,000 --> 0:11:43,000
well, first of all, the perfect recycling

273
0:11:44.893,000 --> 0:11:45,000
because they're grown on food waste;

274
0:11:46.647,000 --> 0:11:47,000
but second,

275
0:11:47.823,000 --> 0:11:48,000
think of fly-fishing,

276
0:11:48.998,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and you know how logical it actually is to use it as fish feed.

277
0:11:52.712,000 --> 0:11:54,000
You don't need large tracts of land for it

278
0:11:54.759,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and you don't need to cut down rain forests for it.

279
0:11:57.87,000 --> 0:12:,000
And microbes and insects are actually net water producers.

280
0:12:01.509,000 --> 0:12:03,000
This revolution is starting as we speak,

281
0:12:03.762,000 --> 0:12:04,000
it just needs scale.

282
0:12:06.492,000 --> 0:12:09,000
We can now farm far more species than ever before

283
0:12:09.583,000 --> 0:12:12,000
in controlled, natural conditions, creating happy fish.

284
0:12:13.897,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I imagine, for example,

285
0:12:15.205,000 --> 0:12:2,000
a closed system that's performing more efficiently than insect farming,

286
0:12:20.837,000 --> 0:12:23,000
where you can produce healthy, happy, delicious fish

287
0:12:24.105,000 --> 0:12:25,000
with little or no effluent,

288
0:12:25.501,000 --> 0:12:27,000
almost no energy and almost no water

289
0:12:27.985,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and a natural feed with a minimal footprint.

290
0:12:31.084,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Or a system where you grow up to 10 species next to each other --

291
0:12:34.335,000 --> 0:12:35,000
off of each other,

292
0:12:35.735,000 --> 0:12:36,000
mimicking nature.

293
0:12:37.918,000 --> 0:12:38,000
You need very little feed,

294
0:12:39.312,000 --> 0:12:4,000
very little footprint.

295
0:12:40.558,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I think of seaweed growing off the effluent of fish, for example.

296
0:12:46.453,000 --> 0:12:48,000
There's great technologies popping up all over the globe.

297
0:12:49.574,000 --> 0:12:51,000
From alternatives to battle disease

298
0:12:51.777,000 --> 0:12:53,000
so we don't need antibiotics and chemicals anymore,

299
0:12:54.666,000 --> 0:12:57,000
to automated feeders that feel when the fish are hungry,

300
0:12:58.346,000 --> 0:13:01,000
so we can save on feed and create less pollution.

301
0:13:02.016,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Software systems that gather data across farms,

302
0:13:04.643,000 --> 0:13:05,000
so we can improve farm practices.

303
0:13:07.127,000 --> 0:13:09,000
There's really cool stuff happening all over the globe.

304
0:13:10.67,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And make no mistake -- all of these things are possible

305
0:13:13.337,000 --> 0:13:16,000
at a cost that's competitive to what a farmer spends today.

306
0:13:17.024,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Tomorrow, there will be no excuse for anyone to not do the right thing.

307
0:13:22.164,000 --> 0:13:24,000
So somebody needs to connect the dots

308
0:13:24.447,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and give these developments a big kick in the butt.

309
0:13:27.054,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And that's what we've been working on the last couple of years,

310
0:13:30.095,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and that's what we need to be working on together --

311
0:13:33.049,000 --> 0:13:35,000
rethinking everything from the ground up,

312
0:13:35.424,000 --> 0:13:37,000
with a holistic view across the value chain,

313
0:13:37.967,000 --> 0:13:39,000
connecting all these things across the globe,

314
0:13:40.125,000 --> 0:13:42,000
alongside great entrepreneurs

315
0:13:42.197,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that are willing to share a collective vision.

316
0:13:45.474,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Now is the time to create change in this industry

317
0:13:48.331,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and to push it into a sustainable direction.

318
0:13:50.566,000 --> 0:13:51,000
This industry is still young,

319
0:13:52.012,000 --> 0:13:53,000
much of its growth is still ahead.

320
0:13:54.041,000 --> 0:13:56,000
It's a big task, but not as far-fetched as you might think.

321
0:13:56.899,000 --> 0:13:57,000
It's possible.

322
0:13:59.032,000 --> 0:14:01,000
So we need to take pressure off the ocean.

323
0:14:01.233,000 --> 0:14:02,000
We want to eat good and healthy.

324
0:14:02.804,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And if we eat an animal, it needs to be one

325
0:14:04.9,000 --> 0:14:05,000
that had a happy and healthy life.

326
0:14:06.582,000 --> 0:14:08,000
We need to have a meal that we can trust,

327
0:14:08.813,000 --> 0:14:09,000
live long lives.

328
0:14:10.577,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And this is not just for people in San Francisco or Northern Europe --

329
0:14:14.5,000 --> 0:14:15,000
this is for all of us.

330
0:14:16.37,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Even in the poorest countries,

331
0:14:18.054,000 --> 0:14:19,000
it's not just about money.

332
0:14:19.588,000 --> 0:14:22,000
People prefer something fresh and healthy that they can trust

333
0:14:23.428,000 --> 0:14:26,000
over something that comes from far away that they know nothing about.

334
0:14:27.244,000 --> 0:14:28,000
We're all the same.

335
0:14:30.267,000 --> 0:14:31,000
The day will come

336
0:14:31.442,000 --> 0:14:34,000
where people will realize -- no, demand -- farmed fish on their plate

337
0:14:34.727,000 --> 0:14:36,000
that's farmed well and that's farmed healthy --

338
0:14:38.204,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and refuse anything less.

339
0:14:39.482,000 --> 0:14:4,000
You can help speed this up.

340
0:14:41.163,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Ask questions when you order seafood.

341
0:14:43.545,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Where does my fish come from?

342
0:14:45.426,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Who raised it,

343
0:14:46.965,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and what did it eat?

344
0:14:49.008,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Information about where your fish comes from and how it was produced

345
0:14:52.691,000 --> 0:14:54,000
needs to be much more readily available.

346
0:14:55.663,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And consumers need to put pressure on the aquaculture industry

347
0:14:58.871,000 --> 0:14:59,000
to do the right thing.

348
0:15:00.653,000 --> 0:15:02,000
So every time you order,

349
0:15:02.72,000 --> 0:15:03,000
ask for detail

350
0:15:04.711,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and show that you really care about what you eat

351
0:15:07.217,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and what's been given to you.

352
0:15:08.999,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And eventually, they will listen.

353
0:15:11.367,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And all of us will benefit.

354
0:15:13.575,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Thank you.

355
0:15:14.75,000 --> 0:15:16,000

1
0:00:14.079,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Before I get started:

2
0:00:15.277,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'm really excited to be here

3
0:00:16.689,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to just actually watch what's going to happen, from here.

4
0:00:19.951,000 --> 0:00:24,000
So with that said, we're going to start with:

5
0:00:25.424,000 --> 0:00:28,000
What is one of our greatest needs,

6
0:00:28.49,000 --> 0:00:3,000
one of our greatest needs for our brain?

7
0:00:30.823,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And instead of telling you, I want to show you.

8
0:00:33.075,000 --> 0:00:34,000
In fact, I want you to feel it.

9
0:00:34.58,000 --> 0:00:36,000
There's a lot I want you to feel in the next 14 minutes.

10
0:00:37.243,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So, if we could all stand up.

11
0:00:39.499,000 --> 0:00:43,000
We're all going to conduct a piece of Strauss together.

12
0:00:44.546,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Alright? And you all know it.

13
0:00:46.815,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Alright. Are you ready?

14
0:00:48.401,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Audience: Yeah!

15
0:00:49.586,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Beau Lotto: Alright. Ready, one, two, three!

16
0:00:52.506,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It's just the end.

17
0:00:53.728,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Music: Richard Strauss "Also Sprach Zarathustra")

18
0:01:01.036,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Right?

19
0:01:02.235,000 --> 0:01:03,000
You know where it's going.

20
0:01:03.753,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Music)

21
0:01:13.95,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Oh, it's coming!

22
0:01:22.591,000 --> 0:01:23,000
(Music stops abruptly)

23
0:01:24.004,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Oh!

24
0:01:25.179,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:26.369,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Right?

26
0:01:27.56,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Collective coitus interruptus.

27
0:01:29.036,000 --> 0:01:3,000
OK, you can all sit down.

28
0:01:30.457,000 --> 0:01:31,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:32.381,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We have a fundamental need for closure.

30
0:01:35.564,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:37.532,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We love closure.

32
0:01:39.365,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Applause)

33
0:01:41.927,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I was told the story that Mozart, just before he'd go to bed,

34
0:01:45.201,000 --> 0:01:46,000
he'd go to the piano and go,

35
0:01:46.611,000 --> 0:01:47,000
"da-da-da-da-da."

36
0:01:47.789,000 --> 0:01:49,000
His father, who was already in bed, would think, "Argh."

37
0:01:50.496,000 --> 0:01:52,000
He'd have to get up and hit the final note to the chord

38
0:01:53.212,000 --> 0:01:54,000
before he could go back to sleep.

39
0:01:54.84,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:55.958,000 --> 0:02:,000
So the need for closure leads us to thinking about:

41
0:02:01.083,000 --> 0:02:03,000
What is our greatest fear?

42
0:02:04.378,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Think -- what is our greatest fear growing up, even now?

43
0:02:09.407,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And it's the fear of the dark.

44
0:02:15.717,000 --> 0:02:17,000
We hate uncertainty.

45
0:02:18.384,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We hate to not know.

46
0:02:20.368,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We hate it.

47
0:02:21.558,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Think about horror films.

48
0:02:23.021,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Horror films are always shot in the dark,

49
0:02:25.815,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in the forest,

50
0:02:27.815,000 --> 0:02:28,000
at night,

51
0:02:29.077,000 --> 0:02:3,000
in the depths of the sea,

52
0:02:30.372,000 --> 0:02:31,000
the blackness of space.

53
0:02:32.539,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And the reason is because dying was easy during evolution.

54
0:02:35.894,000 --> 0:02:36,000
If you weren't sure that was a predator,

55
0:02:37.839,000 --> 0:02:38,000
it was too late.

56
0:02:39.49,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Your brain evolved to predict.

57
0:02:42.057,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And if you couldn't predict, you died.

58
0:02:45.136,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And the way your brain predicts is by encoding the bias and assumptions

59
0:02:49.376,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that were useful in the past.

60
0:02:51.593,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But those assumptions just don't stay inside your brain.

61
0:02:54.403,000 --> 0:02:56,000
You project them out into the world.

62
0:02:57.498,000 --> 0:02:58,000
There is no bird there.

63
0:03:00.006,000 --> 0:03:03,000
You're projecting the meaning onto the screen.

64
0:03:04.506,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Everything I'm saying to you right now is literally meaningless.

65
0:03:09.151,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:11.604,000 --> 0:03:14,000
You're creating the meaning and projecting it onto me.

67
0:03:14.699,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And what's true for objects is true for other people.

68
0:03:17.31,000 --> 0:03:19,000
While you can measure their "what" and their "when,"

69
0:03:19.768,000 --> 0:03:2,000
you can never measure their "why."

70
0:03:21.649,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So we color other people.

71
0:03:22.871,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We project a meaning onto them based on our biases and our experience.

72
0:03:29.911,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Which is why the best of design is almost always about decreasing uncertainty.

73
0:03:34.739,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So when we step into uncertainty,

74
0:03:37.858,000 --> 0:03:39,000
our bodies respond physiologically and mentally.

75
0:03:40.786,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Your immune system will start deteriorating.

76
0:03:43.659,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Your brain cells wither and even die.

77
0:03:46.533,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Your creativity and intelligence decrease.

78
0:03:50.443,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We often go from fear to anger, almost too often.

79
0:03:54.356,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Why? Because fear is a state of certainty.

80
0:03:57.87,000 --> 0:03:58,000
You become morally judgmental.

81
0:03:59.775,000 --> 0:04:01,000
You become an extreme version of yourself.

82
0:04:01.902,000 --> 0:04:03,000
If you're a conservative, you become more conservative.

83
0:04:04.529,000 --> 0:04:06,000
If you're a liberal, you become more liberal.

84
0:04:06.696,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Because you go to a place of familiarity.

85
0:04:10.133,000 --> 0:04:13,000
The problem is that the world changes.

86
0:04:13.95,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And we have to adapt or die.

87
0:04:15.482,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And if you want to shift from A to B,

88
0:04:17.284,000 --> 0:04:18,000
the first step is not B.

89
0:04:19.204,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The first step is to go from A to not A --

90
0:04:23.141,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to let go of your bias and assumptions;

91
0:04:25.356,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to step into the very place that our brain evolved to avoid;

92
0:04:31.696,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to step into the place of the unknown.

93
0:04:37.553,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But it's so essential that we go to this place

94
0:04:40.204,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that our brain gave us a solution.

95
0:04:42.966,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Evolution gave us a solution.

96
0:04:45.133,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And it's possibly one of the most profound perceptual experiences.

97
0:04:50.971,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And it's the experience of awe.

98
0:04:55.86,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Music)

99
0:05:56.333,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Applause)

100
0:06:01.109,000 --> 0:06:06,000
(Music)

101
0:06:08.87,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Applause)

102
0:06:12.878,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Music)

103
0:06:56.557,000 --> 0:07:,000
(Applause)

104
0:07:02.438,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Music)

105
0:07:16.881,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Applause)

106
0:07:21.92,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Cheers)

107
0:07:25.793,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Applause)

108
0:07:31.836,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Beau Lotto: Ah, how wonderful, right?

109
0:07:34.9,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So right now, you're probably all feeling, at some level or another, awe.

110
0:07:42.332,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Right?

111
0:07:43.507,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So what's happening inside your brain right now?

112
0:07:47.57,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And for thousands of years,

113
0:07:49.021,000 --> 0:07:52,000
we've been thinking and writing and experiencing awe,

114
0:07:52.434,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and we know so little about it.

115
0:07:55.514,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And so to try to understand what is it and what does it do,

116
0:08:01.643,000 --> 0:08:06,000
my Lab of Misfits had just the wonderful opportunity and the pleasure

117
0:08:07.5,000 --> 0:08:12,000
to work with who are some of the greatest creators of awe that we know:

118
0:08:12.538,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the writers, the creators, the directors, the accountants,

119
0:08:16.432,000 --> 0:08:18,000
the people who are Cirque Du Soleil.

120
0:08:20.137,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And so we went to Las Vegas,

121
0:08:23.12,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and we recorded the brain activity of people

122
0:08:26.64,000 --> 0:08:28,000
while they're watching the performance,

123
0:08:28.998,000 --> 0:08:3,000
over 10 performances of "O,"

124
0:08:31.808,000 --> 0:08:33,000
which is iconic Cirque performance.

125
0:08:34.665,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And we also measured the behavior before the performance,

126
0:08:38.253,000 --> 0:08:4,000
as well as a different group after the performance.

127
0:08:41.332,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And so we had over 200 people involved.

128
0:08:45.371,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So what is awe?

129
0:08:47.347,000 --> 0:08:49,000
What is happening inside your brain right now?

130
0:08:49.53,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It's a brain state. OK?

131
0:08:52.562,000 --> 0:08:54,000
The front part of your brain, the prefrontal cortex,

132
0:08:55.284,000 --> 0:08:57,000
which is responsible for your executive function,

133
0:08:57.625,000 --> 0:08:58,000
your attentional control,

134
0:08:58.899,000 --> 0:08:59,000
is now being downregulated.

135
0:09:02.157,000 --> 0:09:06,000
The part of your brain called the DMN, default mode network,

136
0:09:06.801,000 --> 0:09:08,000
which is the interaction between multiple areas in your brain,

137
0:09:09.8,000 --> 0:09:12,000
which is active during, sort of, ideation,

138
0:09:13.538,000 --> 0:09:16,000
creative thinking in terms of divergent thinking and daydreaming,

139
0:09:16.784,000 --> 0:09:17,000
is now being upregulated.

140
0:09:19.942,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And right about now,

141
0:09:21.958,000 --> 0:09:23,000
the activity in your prefrontal cortex is changing.

142
0:09:25.416,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It's becoming asymmetrical in its activity,

143
0:09:28.368,000 --> 0:09:29,000
biased towards the right,

144
0:09:29.702,000 --> 0:09:32,000
which is highly correlated when people step forward into the world,

145
0:09:33.567,000 --> 0:09:34,000
as opposed to step back.

146
0:09:36.718,000 --> 0:09:4,000
In fact, the activity across the brains of all these people was so correlated

147
0:09:41.726,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that we're able to train an artificial neural network

148
0:09:44.282,000 --> 0:09:46,000
to predict whether or not people are experiencing awe

149
0:09:47.015,000 --> 0:09:5,000
to an accuracy of 75 percent on average,

150
0:09:50.244,000 --> 0:09:51,000
with a maximum of 83 percent.

151
0:09:54.946,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So what does this brain state do?

152
0:09:58.85,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Well, others have demonstrated,

153
0:10:00.603,000 --> 0:10:02,000
for instance, Professors Haidt and Keltner,

154
0:10:03.2,000 --> 0:10:07,000
have told us that people feel small but connected to the world.

155
0:10:08.662,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And their prosocial behavior increases,

156
0:10:12.193,000 --> 0:10:14,000
because they feel an increased affinity towards others.

157
0:10:15.836,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And we've also shown in this study

158
0:10:18.257,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that people have less need for cognitive control.

159
0:10:21.654,000 --> 0:10:25,000
They're more comfortable with uncertainty without having closure.

160
0:10:26.408,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And their appetite for risk also increases.

161
0:10:29.497,000 --> 0:10:32,000
They actually seek risk, and they are better able at taking it.

162
0:10:34.172,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And something that was really quite profound

163
0:10:36.775,000 --> 0:10:37,000
is that when we asked people,

164
0:10:38.323,000 --> 0:10:41,000
"Are you someone who has a propensity to experience awe?"

165
0:10:42.641,000 --> 0:10:44,000
They were more likely to give a positive response

166
0:10:45.212,000 --> 0:10:47,000
after the performance than they were [before].

167
0:10:47.415,000 --> 0:10:5,000
They literally redefined themselves and their history.

168
0:10:52.974,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So, awe is possibly the perception that is bigger than us.

169
0:11:00.823,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And in the words of Joseph Campbell,

170
0:11:02.895,000 --> 0:11:05,000
"Awe is what enables us to move forward."

171
0:11:06.522,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Or in the words of a dear friend,

172
0:11:08.474,000 --> 0:11:1,000
probably one of our greatest photographers,

173
0:11:10.68,000 --> 0:11:12,000
still living photographers, Duane Michaels,

174
0:11:12.776,000 --> 0:11:13,000
he said to me just the other day

175
0:11:14.395,000 --> 0:11:18,000
that maybe it gives us the curiosity to overcome our cowardice.

176
0:11:20.752,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So who cares? Why should we care?

177
0:11:24.534,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Well, consider conflict,

178
0:11:25.892,000 --> 0:11:28,000
which seems to be so omnipresent in our society at the moment.

179
0:11:29.249,000 --> 0:11:3,000
If you and I are in conflict,

180
0:11:31.05,000 --> 0:11:33,000
it's as if we're at the opposite ends of the same line.

181
0:11:34.03,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And my aim is to prove that you're wrong and to shift you towards me.

182
0:11:37.299,000 --> 0:11:39,000
The problem is, you are doing exactly the same.

183
0:11:39.562,000 --> 0:11:42,000
You're trying to prove that I'm wrong and shift me towards you.

184
0:11:42.76,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Notice that conflict is the setup to win but not learn.

185
0:11:48.525,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Your brain only learns if we move.

186
0:11:51.179,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Life is movement.

187
0:11:54.555,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So, what if we could use awe, not to get rid of conflict --

188
0:11:59.976,000 --> 0:12:02,000
conflict is essential, conflict is how your brain expands,

189
0:12:03.538,000 --> 0:12:04,000
it's how your brain learns --

190
0:12:05.419,000 --> 0:12:08,000
but rather, to enter conflict in a different way?

191
0:12:09.561,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And what if awe could enable us to enter it

192
0:12:12.819,000 --> 0:12:13,000
in at least two different ways?

193
0:12:14.328,000 --> 0:12:17,000
One, to give us the humility and courage to not know.

194
0:12:18.466,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Right? To enter conflict with a question instead of an answer.

195
0:12:22.538,000 --> 0:12:23,000
What would happen then?

196
0:12:23.965,000 --> 0:12:26,000
To enter the conflict with uncertainty instead of certainty.

197
0:12:27.798,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And the second is, in entering conflict that way,

198
0:12:30.536,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to seek to understand, rather than convince.

199
0:12:35.377,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Because everyone makes sense to themselves, right?

200
0:12:39.461,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And to understand another person,

201
0:12:41.081,000 --> 0:12:43,000
is to understand the biases and assumptions

202
0:12:43.128,000 --> 0:12:44,000
that give rise to their behavior.

203
0:12:46.493,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And we've actually initiated a pilot study

204
0:12:49.18,000 --> 0:12:52,000
to look to see whether we could use art-induced awe

205
0:12:52.61,000 --> 0:12:54,000
to facilitate toleration.

206
0:12:55.895,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And the results are actually incredibly positive.

207
0:12:58.577,000 --> 0:13:01,000
We can mitigate against anger and hate

208
0:13:01.628,000 --> 0:13:04,000
through the experience of awe generated by art.

209
0:13:06.08,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So where can we find awe,

210
0:13:10.025,000 --> 0:13:11,000
given how important it is?

211
0:13:14.914,000 --> 0:13:16,000
So, what if ...

212
0:13:18.747,000 --> 0:13:19,000
A suggestion:

213
0:13:20.557,000 --> 0:13:23,000
that awe is not just to be found in the grandeur.

214
0:13:24.914,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Awe is essential.

215
0:13:26.108,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Often, it's scale -- the mountains, the sunscape.

216
0:13:31.506,000 --> 0:13:34,000
But what if we could actually rescale ourselves

217
0:13:36.356,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and find the impossible in the simple?

218
0:13:41.165,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And if this is true,

219
0:13:43.431,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and our data are right,

220
0:13:46.787,000 --> 0:13:48,000
then endeavors like science,

221
0:13:49.224,000 --> 0:13:53,000
adventure, art, ideas, love,

222
0:13:53.279,000 --> 0:13:55,000
a TED conference, performance,

223
0:13:57.171,000 --> 0:13:59,000
are not only inspired by awe,

224
0:14:01.029,000 --> 0:14:04,000
but could actually be our ladders into uncertainty

225
0:14:05.897,000 --> 0:14:06,000
to help us expand.

226
0:14:26.736,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Thank you very much.

227
0:14:28.101,000 --> 0:14:29,000
(Applause)

228
0:14:29.276,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Please, come up.

229
0:14:30.451,000 --> 0:14:33,000
(Applause)

230
0:14:34.473,000 --> 0:14:38,000
(Cheers)

231
0:14:38.578,000 --> 0:14:44,000
(Applause)

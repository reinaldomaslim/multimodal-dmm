1
0:00:12.787,000 --> 0:00:17,000
If I asked you to name a microbe that's living in your gut,

2
0:00:18.325,000 --> 0:00:21,000
many of you would probably say E. coli.

3
0:00:21.7,000 --> 0:00:24,000
A lot of people say this. It's the best-known of the gut microbes.

4
0:00:25.489,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But it turns out that E. coli is outnumbered in your gut

5
0:00:30.018,000 --> 0:00:32,000
about a thousand to one

6
0:00:32.135,000 --> 0:00:34,000
by other species, many of which you probably haven't heard of.

7
0:00:35.15,000 --> 0:00:39,000
These are Bacteroides; Prevotella is another example.

8
0:00:39.755,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Those are the two that dominate the modern human gut.

9
0:00:43.247,000 --> 0:00:47,000
There are about a hundred trillion microbes living inside you.

10
0:00:49.09,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We call this your microbiome,

11
0:00:52.385,000 --> 0:00:54,000
so it's like a little world living inside you --

12
0:00:54.653,000 --> 0:00:55,000
actually more like a universe.

13
0:00:56.896,000 --> 0:00:59,000
A hundred trillion means if you took a blade of grass

14
0:01:00.374,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and planted it for every microbe living in your gut,

15
0:01:03.523,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that could fill a million football fields.

16
0:01:05.901,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So it's incredibly complex.

17
0:01:07.671,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But interestingly,

18
0:01:09.511,000 --> 0:01:13,000
as our bodies have been adapting to life in modern society,

19
0:01:13.968,000 --> 0:01:17,000
we're losing some of our normal microbes,

20
0:01:18.096,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and at the same time,

21
0:01:21.045,000 --> 0:01:24,000
there are quite a few diseases related to the gut

22
0:01:24.424,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that are skyrocketing in developed nations all around the world.

23
0:01:29.877,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And many of you probably know someone who suffers from obesity,

24
0:01:34.56,000 --> 0:01:37,000
diabetes, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis,

25
0:01:38.545,000 --> 0:01:39,000
allergies and asthma.

26
0:01:40.464,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Every one of these diseases

27
0:01:41.853,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and many others related to metabolism and autoimmunity

28
0:01:46.124,000 --> 0:01:51,000
are linked to a loss of healthy diversity in the gut.

29
0:01:52.081,000 --> 0:01:54,000
My lab got our first indication of this

30
0:01:54.296,000 --> 0:01:57,000
when actually we were studying non-human primates.

31
0:01:58.09,000 --> 0:02:03,000
We wanted to find out what happens to a monkey's microbiome

32
0:02:03.245,000 --> 0:02:07,000
when they move from the jungle to a zoo.

33
0:02:08.166,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Does their microbiome change? Do they pick up new bugs?

34
0:02:10.762,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Do they lose some? Does it get better or worse?

35
0:02:13.527,000 --> 0:02:16,000
We tracked two different species in the jungle,

36
0:02:17.065,000 --> 0:02:2,000
one in Vietnam, one in Costa Rica,

37
0:02:20.699,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and then we sequenced the DNA from their stool.

38
0:02:23.604,000 --> 0:02:26,000
This is how we study the microbiome in my research lab.

39
0:02:27.169,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And what we found in the DNA is that in the wild,

40
0:02:31.305,000 --> 0:02:34,000
these two species had totally different sets of microbes.

41
0:02:35.29,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It was like a fingerprint for the species.

42
0:02:37.926,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But in the zoo, they had lost most of that diversity

43
0:02:43.115,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and had acquired some other set of microbes.

44
0:02:46.379,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So this was very curious.

45
0:02:49.751,000 --> 0:02:51,000
We've got these two different microbiomes.

46
0:02:51.784,000 --> 0:02:55,000
In the wild, picture a lush tropical rainforest

47
0:02:55.966,000 --> 0:02:57,000
living the guts of these monkeys.

48
0:02:58.459,000 --> 0:03:,000
That's the kind of diversity that we're talking about.

49
0:03:01.023,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Then in the zoo, they've lost diversity.

50
0:03:04.298,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Picture a rainforest that's been burned to the ground

51
0:03:07.894,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and taken over by a few invasive species.

52
0:03:11.105,000 --> 0:03:14,000
That's more like the microbiome in a captive primate.

53
0:03:15.955,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Now, in the meantime,

54
0:03:17.216,000 --> 0:03:19,000
many of the animals in the zoo are not doing so well.

55
0:03:19.867,000 --> 0:03:21,000
They have issues with obesity,

56
0:03:22.797,000 --> 0:03:23,000
wasting,

57
0:03:24.157,000 --> 0:03:27,000
gastroenteritis, diarrhea, bloating,

58
0:03:27.23,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and some of them were barely holding onto their lives.

59
0:03:31.073,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Now, of course, we were very interested to find out

60
0:03:34.685,000 --> 0:03:38,000
what are these so-called invasive species that are taking over in the zoo.

61
0:03:39.899,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So we went back to the DNA, and what the DNA told us

62
0:03:42.812,000 --> 0:03:46,000
is that every monkey in the zoo

63
0:03:47.339,000 --> 0:03:52,000
had become dominated by Bacteroides and Prevotella,

64
0:03:52.531,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the same microbes that we all have in our guts as modern humans.

65
0:03:59.05,000 --> 0:04:01,000
We wanted to find a way to visualize this,

66
0:04:01.967,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and we used some tools from multivariate ecology

67
0:04:05.931,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to put all of the microbiomes we were studying onto an axis.

68
0:04:10.367,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And what you're seeing here is a distance plot

69
0:04:14.461,000 --> 0:04:18,000
where every point is a different animal's microbiome.

70
0:04:19.39,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So every point represents a whole zoo of microbes.

71
0:04:23.207,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And the microbiomes that have a lot of microbes in common

72
0:04:27.087,000 --> 0:04:28,000
are close to each other.

73
0:04:28.524,000 --> 0:04:3,000
The ones that are very different are farther apart.

74
0:04:30.996,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So this is showing you

75
0:04:32.537,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that the two groups of wild monkeys are over on the left.

76
0:04:38.259,000 --> 0:04:41,000
The top left are these highly endangered monkeys

77
0:04:42.055,000 --> 0:04:44,000
called the red-shanked douc in Vietnam.

78
0:04:45.052,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And at the bottom left are monkeys from Costa Rica.

79
0:04:49.481,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So you can see that they have totally different microbiomes in the wild.

80
0:04:52.949,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And then the same two species of monkey in the zoo are converging,

81
0:04:58.37,000 --> 0:04:59,000
so their microbiomes change

82
0:05:00.276,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and they become much more similar to each other,

83
0:05:03.52,000 --> 0:05:05,000
even though these are zoos on different continents,

84
0:05:06.217,000 --> 0:05:09,000
different geographical regions, and they're eating different diets.

85
0:05:09.583,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now, we did study some other species of primate.

86
0:05:12.768,000 --> 0:05:17,000
What species of primate do you think is even more divergent

87
0:05:18.531,000 --> 0:05:21,000
from the wild primates than the captive primates?

88
0:05:24.665,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Modern humans.

89
0:05:27.049,000 --> 0:05:3,000
These are humans living in developing nations.

90
0:05:30.556,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So they were more different from the wild primates

91
0:05:33.723,000 --> 0:05:34,000
than those in the zoo.

92
0:05:35.668,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And the final group that we studied, all the way on the right,

93
0:05:41.073,000 --> 0:05:42,000
is people living in the USA.

94
0:05:44.033,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And when I saw this figure,

95
0:05:46.905,000 --> 0:05:49,000
the hairs raised up on the back of my neck,

96
0:05:50.03,000 --> 0:05:53,000
because one way to think about it is, "Oh, that's interesting,

97
0:05:53.141,000 --> 0:05:56,000
captive monkeys are sort of on their way to becoming like Americans."

98
0:05:57.109,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Laughter)

99
0:05:58.22,000 --> 0:06:,000
But the other way to think about it

100
0:06:00.64,000 --> 0:06:03,000
is that Americans are like super-captive monkeys.

101
0:06:04.671,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And I was actually looking at this figure on my computer screen

102
0:06:09.393,000 --> 0:06:13,000
when I got the news that four of the red-shanked doucs

103
0:06:14.345,000 --> 0:06:17,000
had died in the zoo of gut-related issues.

104
0:06:17.473,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So for some of these animals,

105
0:06:19.465,000 --> 0:06:21,000
having the right microbes living inside them

106
0:06:22.187,000 --> 0:06:23,000
may be a matter of survival.

107
0:06:24.181,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Now this brings us to the human part of the story.

108
0:06:27.712,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Obviously, the microbiomes in the USA

109
0:06:30.951,000 --> 0:06:35,000
aren't causing premature death as frequently as in the zoo,

110
0:06:36.476,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but we have major risk of obesity, diabetes,

111
0:06:40.874,000 --> 0:06:41,000
a number of these other diseases.

112
0:06:43.133,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And this applies not just to people who have been living in the USA

113
0:06:47.577,000 --> 0:06:48,000
for many generations,

114
0:06:49.585,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but also to immigrants and refugees,

115
0:06:52.045,000 --> 0:06:55,000
who, for most immigrant and refugee groups,

116
0:06:55.751,000 --> 0:06:58,000
arrive in the USA metabolically healthy,

117
0:06:58.876,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and then within a few years,

118
0:07:00.28,000 --> 0:07:03,000
they become just as high-risk for obesity and diabetes

119
0:07:03.662,000 --> 0:07:05,000
as other Americans.

120
0:07:05.767,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And we discussed this issue with two groups

121
0:07:09.489,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that have been coming to the USA from Southeast Asia:

122
0:07:12.06,000 --> 0:07:16,000
the Hmong, who started coming in the mid-1970s

123
0:07:16.278,000 --> 0:07:21,000
as refugees from the Vietnam War and the US secret war in Laos;

124
0:07:21.802,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and the Karen, who have been coming more recently as refugees from Myanmar.

125
0:07:26.738,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So we've been working for a few years

126
0:07:28.54,000 --> 0:07:3,000
with these local communities and clinicians

127
0:07:31.105,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to study what happens to the Hmong and Karen microbiomes

128
0:07:36.546,000 --> 0:07:42,000
when people move from refugee camps and villages in Thailand to the USA.

129
0:07:44.314,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And what we found

130
0:07:45.902,000 --> 0:07:5,000
is that when people come to the USA from these groups,

131
0:07:51.637,000 --> 0:07:54,000
they lose a large fraction of their microbiome,

132
0:07:56.343,000 --> 0:07:57,000
somewhere around 20 percent,

133
0:07:58.144,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and those who come to the USA and become obese

134
0:08:02.437,000 --> 0:08:03,000
lose about a third of their microbes.

135
0:08:06.905,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So we know that moving to the USA

136
0:08:08.881,000 --> 0:08:11,000
is sufficient to cause a dramatic change in your microbiome,

137
0:08:12.898,000 --> 0:08:13,000
probably not for the better.

138
0:08:15.571,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Are these microbes actually causing the obesity,

139
0:08:20.453,000 --> 0:08:23,000
or is the obesity causing a change in the microbes?

140
0:08:23.937,000 --> 0:08:25,000
This is something that we're following up on,

141
0:08:26.104,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and the evidence we have now in my lab

142
0:08:29.77,000 --> 0:08:32,000
combined with evidence from a number of labs around the world

143
0:08:32.904,000 --> 0:08:35,000
tells us that certain changes in the microbiome

144
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
do lead to obesity,

145
0:08:38.533,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and a number of other modern, kind of Westernized diseases.

146
0:08:43.353,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The good news is that your microbiome can actually change.

147
0:08:48.686,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Unlike your own genome,

148
0:08:51.233,000 --> 0:08:53,000
it's a living, breathing thing,

149
0:08:53.606,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and there's a broad front of research happening right now

150
0:08:57.161,000 --> 0:09:,000
to better understand how we can restore our microbiomes

151
0:09:00.979,000 --> 0:09:01,000
when something goes wrong,

152
0:09:02.606,000 --> 0:09:03,000
using diet,

153
0:09:04.257,000 --> 0:09:06,000
using live microbes.

154
0:09:06.939,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And in fact, one of the next steps for us

155
0:09:09.763,000 --> 0:09:13,000
is collecting and preserving microbes from healthy people around the world

156
0:09:14.375,000 --> 0:09:19,000
so that they can be kept as cultural assets for those groups

157
0:09:19.954,000 --> 0:09:23,000
to potentially protect them as they adapt to modern society,

158
0:09:24.819,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and to protect future generations

159
0:09:27.297,000 --> 0:09:31,000
who are currently growing up to have increased risk of these diseases

160
0:09:31.52,000 --> 0:09:32,000
with every generation.

161
0:09:33.714,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I'm looking forward to a future

162
0:09:36.34,000 --> 0:09:42,000
where we have the tools that we need to restore and replenish our microbiomes,

163
0:09:43.562,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and in that world, the monkeys will live happier and healthier lives,

164
0:09:48.855,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and so will we.

165
0:09:51.831,000 --> 0:09:54,000

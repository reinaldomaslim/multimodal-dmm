1
0:00:12.42,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Imagine that when you walked in here this evening,

2
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
you discovered that everybody in the room looked almost exactly the same:

3
0:00:20.1,000 --> 0:00:21,000
ageless, raceless,

4
0:00:22.06,000 --> 0:00:23,000
generically good-looking.

5
0:00:24.1,000 --> 0:00:25,000
That person sitting right next to you

6
0:00:26.1,000 --> 0:00:28,000
might have the most idiosyncratic inner life,

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but you don't have a clue

8
0:00:29.54,000 --> 0:00:32,000
because we're all wearing the same blank expression all the time.

9
0:00:34.78,000 --> 0:00:38,000
That is the kind of creepy transformation that is taking over cities,

10
0:00:39.74,000 --> 0:00:41,000
only it applies to buildings, not people.

11
0:00:43.3,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Cities are full of roughness and shadow,

12
0:00:49.3,000 --> 0:00:5,000
texture and color.

13
0:00:50.54,000 --> 0:00:55,000
You can still find architectural surfaces of great individuality and character

14
0:00:57.18,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in apartment buildings in Riga

15
0:00:59.9,000 --> 0:01:,000
and Yemen,

16
0:01:02.34,000 --> 0:01:03,000
social housing in Vienna,

17
0:01:04.82,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Hopi villages in Arizona,

18
0:01:07.22,000 --> 0:01:08,000
brownstones in New York,

19
0:01:09.34,000 --> 0:01:1,000
wooden houses in San Francisco.

20
0:01:11.62,000 --> 0:01:12,000
These aren't palaces or cathedrals.

21
0:01:13.9,000 --> 0:01:14,000
These are just ordinary residences

22
0:01:15.7,000 --> 0:01:17,000
expressing the ordinary splendor of cities.

23
0:01:19.3,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And the reason they're like that is that the need for shelter

24
0:01:22.62,000 --> 0:01:25,000
is so bound up with the human desire for beauty.

25
0:01:28.42,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Their rough surfaces give us a touchable city.

26
0:01:32.66,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Right? Streets that you can read

27
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
by running your fingers over brick and stone.

28
0:01:37.42,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But that's getting harder to do,

29
0:01:40.02,000 --> 0:01:42,000
because cities are becoming smooth.

30
0:01:43.5,000 --> 0:01:45,000
New downtowns sprout towers

31
0:01:45.58,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that are almost always made of concrete and steel

32
0:01:47.94,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and covered in glass.

33
0:01:50.74,000 --> 0:01:52,000
You can look at skylines all over the world --

34
0:01:53.62,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Houston,

35
0:01:55.46,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Guangzhou,

36
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Frankfurt --

37
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and you see the same army of high-gloss robots

38
0:02:02.7,000 --> 0:02:03,000
marching over the horizon.

39
0:02:05.38,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Now, just think of everything we lose

40
0:02:07.54,000 --> 0:02:11,000
when architects stop using the full range of available materials.

41
0:02:12.62,000 --> 0:02:15,000
When we reject granite and limestone and sandstone

42
0:02:16.38,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and wood and copper and terra-cotta and brick

43
0:02:18.58,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and wattle and plaster,

44
0:02:20.94,000 --> 0:02:22,000
we simplify architecture

45
0:02:23.1,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and we impoverish cities.

46
0:02:25.7,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It's as if you reduced all of the world's cuisines

47
0:02:29.42,000 --> 0:02:3,000
down to airline food.

48
0:02:31.38,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:32.46,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Chicken or pasta?

50
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
But worse still,

51
0:02:37.58,000 --> 0:02:4,000
assemblies of glass towers like this one in Moscow

52
0:02:41.18,000 --> 0:02:45,000
suggest a disdain for the civic and communal aspects of urban living.

53
0:02:46.1,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Right? Buildings like these are intended to enrich their owners and tenants,

54
0:02:51.18,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but not necessarily the lives of the rest of us,

55
0:02:53.78,000 --> 0:02:56,000
those of us who navigate the spaces between the buildings.

56
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
And we expect to do so for free.

57
0:03:01.62,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Shiny towers are an invasive species

58
0:03:04.9,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and they are choking our cities and killing off public space.

59
0:03:09.14,000 --> 0:03:12,000
We tend to think of a facade as being like makeup,

60
0:03:12.62,000 --> 0:03:15,000
a decorative layer applied at the end to a building that's effectively complete.

61
0:03:16.98,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But just because a facade is superficial

62
0:03:19.54,000 --> 0:03:21,000
doesn't mean it's not also deep.

63
0:03:21.82,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Let me give you an example

64
0:03:24.02,000 --> 0:03:27,000
of how a city's surfaces affect the way we live in it.

65
0:03:27.06,000 --> 0:03:29,000
When I visited Salamanca in Spain,

66
0:03:29.98,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I gravitated to the Plaza Mayor

67
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
at all hours of the day.

68
0:03:33.7,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Early in the morning, sunlight rakes the facades,

69
0:03:36.7,000 --> 0:03:37,000
sharpening shadows,

70
0:03:38.42,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and at night, lamplight segments the buildings

71
0:03:41.74,000 --> 0:03:42,000
into hundreds of distinct areas,

72
0:03:44.34,000 --> 0:03:46,000
balconies and windows and arcades,

73
0:03:46.74,000 --> 0:03:48,000
each one a separate pocket of visual activity.

74
0:03:50.5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
That detail and depth, that glamour

75
0:03:54.46,000 --> 0:03:56,000
gives the plaza a theatrical quality.

76
0:03:58.82,000 --> 0:04:,000
It becomes a stage where the generations can meet.

77
0:04:01.98,000 --> 0:04:04,000
You have teenagers sprawling on the pavers,

78
0:04:05.38,000 --> 0:04:07,000
seniors monopolizing the benches,

79
0:04:08.22,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and real life starts to look like an opera set.

80
0:04:12.14,000 --> 0:04:13,000
The curtain goes up on Salamanca.

81
0:04:15.34,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So just because I'm talking about the exteriors of buildings,

82
0:04:20.34,000 --> 0:04:23,000
not form, not function, not structure,

83
0:04:24.58,000 --> 0:04:27,000
even so those surfaces give texture to our lives,

84
0:04:29.219,000 --> 0:04:31,000
because buildings create the spaces around them,

85
0:04:32.14,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and those spaces can draw people in

86
0:04:35.18,000 --> 0:04:36,000
or push them away.

87
0:04:37.1,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And the difference often has to do with the quality of those exteriors.

88
0:04:40.82,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So one contemporary equivalent of the Plaza Mayor in Salamanca

89
0:04:44.58,000 --> 0:04:46,000
is the Place de la Défense in Paris,

90
0:04:47.7,000 --> 0:04:5,000
a windswept, glass-walled open space

91
0:04:51.34,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that office workers hurry through

92
0:04:53.14,000 --> 0:04:55,000
on the way from the metro to their cubicles

93
0:04:55.66,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but otherwise spend as little time in as possible.

94
0:04:59.94,000 --> 0:05:02,000
In the early 1980s, the architect Philip Johnson

95
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
tried to recreate a gracious European plaza in Pittsburgh.

96
0:05:07.5,000 --> 0:05:08,000
This is PPG Place,

97
0:05:09.02,000 --> 0:05:14,000
a half acre of open space encircled by commercial buildings

98
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
made of mirrored glass.

99
0:05:15.74,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And he ornamented those buildings with metal trim and bays

100
0:05:19.18,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and Gothic turrets

101
0:05:21.14,000 --> 0:05:22,000
which really pop on the skyline.

102
0:05:23.7,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But at ground level,

103
0:05:26.34,000 --> 0:05:28,000
the plaza feels like a black glass cage.

104
0:05:29.9,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I mean, sure, in summertime

105
0:05:31.78,000 --> 0:05:33,000
kids are running back and forth through the fountain

106
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and there's ice-skating in the winter,

107
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
but it lacks the informality of a leisurely hangout.

108
0:05:39.5,000 --> 0:05:43,000
It's just not the sort of place you really want to just hang out and chat.

109
0:05:47.3,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Public spaces thrive or fail for many different reasons.

110
0:05:51.06,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Architecture is only one,

111
0:05:53.3,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but it's an important one.

112
0:05:55.66,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Some recent plazas

113
0:05:57.02,000 --> 0:05:59,000
like Federation Square in Melbourne

114
0:06:00.46,000 --> 0:06:02,000
or Superkilen in Copenhagen

115
0:06:03.78,000 --> 0:06:06,000
succeed because they combine old and new,

116
0:06:07.18,000 --> 0:06:08,000
rough and smooth,

117
0:06:09.22,000 --> 0:06:1,000
neutral and bright colors,

118
0:06:11.1,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and because they don't rely excessively on glass.

119
0:06:15.82,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Now, I'm not against glass.

120
0:06:19.62,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It's an ancient and versatile material.

121
0:06:23.46,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It's easy to manufacture and transport

122
0:06:27.7,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and install and replace

123
0:06:29.78,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and clean.

124
0:06:31.34,000 --> 0:06:33,000
It comes in everything from enormous, ultraclear sheets

125
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to translucent bricks.

126
0:06:37.02,000 --> 0:06:39,000
New coatings make it change mood

127
0:06:39.34,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in the shifting light.

128
0:06:41.7,000 --> 0:06:44,000
In expensive cities like New York, it has the magical power

129
0:06:44.98,000 --> 0:06:47,000
of being able to multiply real estate values by allowing views,

130
0:06:48.62,000 --> 0:06:51,000
which is really the only commodity that developers have to offer

131
0:06:51.74,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to justify those surreal prices.

132
0:06:56.22,000 --> 0:06:57,000
In the middle of the 19th century,

133
0:06:58.18,000 --> 0:07:,000
with the construction of the Crystal Palace in London,

134
0:07:00.98,000 --> 0:07:04,000
glass leapt to the top of the list of quintessentially modern substances.

135
0:07:06.1,000 --> 0:07:07,000
By the mid-20th century,

136
0:07:07.62,000 --> 0:07:1,000
it had come to dominate the downtowns of some American cities,

137
0:07:11.5,000 --> 0:07:14,000
largely through some really spectacular office buildings

138
0:07:14.54,000 --> 0:07:17,000
like Lever House in midtown Manhattan, designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.

139
0:07:19.38,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Eventually, the technology advanced to the point

140
0:07:22.1,000 --> 0:07:25,000
where architects could design structures so transparent

141
0:07:25.22,000 --> 0:07:26,000
they practically disappear.

142
0:07:28.18,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And along the way,

143
0:07:29.62,000 --> 0:07:33,000
glass became the default material of the high-rise city,

144
0:07:34.5,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and there's a very powerful reason for that.

145
0:07:37.02,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Because as the world's populations converge on cities,

146
0:07:41.82,000 --> 0:07:44,000
the least fortunate pack into jerry-built shantytowns.

147
0:07:45.5,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But hundreds of millions of people need apartments and places to work

148
0:07:49.34,000 --> 0:07:5,000
in ever-larger buildings,

149
0:07:50.58,000 --> 0:07:52,000
so it makes economic sense to put up towers

150
0:07:53.22,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and wrap them in cheap and practical curtain walls.

151
0:07:57.42,000 --> 0:07:59,000
But glass has a limited ability

152
0:08:00.9,000 --> 0:08:01,000
to be expressive.

153
0:08:03.06,000 --> 0:08:05,000
This is a section of wall framing a plaza

154
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
in the pre-Hispanic city of Mitla, in southern Mexico.

155
0:08:10.46,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Those 2,000-year-old carvings

156
0:08:11.98,000 --> 0:08:14,000
make it clear that this was a place of high ritual significance.

157
0:08:17.06,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Today we look at those and we can see a historical and textural continuity

158
0:08:22.86,000 --> 0:08:24,000
between those carvings, the mountains all around

159
0:08:25.74,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and that church which is built on top of the ruins

160
0:08:29.62,000 --> 0:08:31,000
using stone plundered from the site.

161
0:08:32.7,000 --> 0:08:34,000
In nearby Oaxaca, even ordinary plaster buildings

162
0:08:35.62,000 --> 0:08:39,000
become canvasses for bright colors, political murals

163
0:08:39.98,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and sophisticated graphic arts.

164
0:08:42.82,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It's an intricate, communicative language

165
0:08:46.22,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that an epidemic of glass would simply wipe out.

166
0:08:49.78,000 --> 0:08:51,000
The good news is that architects and developers

167
0:08:52.58,000 --> 0:08:54,000
have begun to rediscover the joys of texture

168
0:08:55.58,000 --> 0:08:57,000
without backing away from modernity.

169
0:08:58.06,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Some find innovative uses for old materials like brick

170
0:09:03.14,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and terra-cotta.

171
0:09:05.58,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Others invent new products like the molded panels that Snøhetta used

172
0:09:10.9,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to give the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art

173
0:09:13.34,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that crinkly, sculptural quality.

174
0:09:16.34,000 --> 0:09:19,000
The architect Stefano Boeri even created living facades.

175
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
This is his Vertical Forest, a pair of apartment towers in Milan,

176
0:09:24.3,000 --> 0:09:25,000
whose most visible feature is greenery.

177
0:09:27.06,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And Boeri is designing a version of this for Nanjing in China.

178
0:09:32.9,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And imagine if green facades were as ubiquitous as glass ones

179
0:09:37.06,000 --> 0:09:39,000
how much cleaner the air in Chinese cities would become.

180
0:09:41.1,000 --> 0:09:44,000
But the truth is that these are mostly one-offs,

181
0:09:44.14,000 --> 0:09:45,000
boutique projects,

182
0:09:45.66,000 --> 0:09:47,000
not easily reproduced at a global scale.

183
0:09:49.54,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And that is the point.

184
0:09:52.18,000 --> 0:09:55,000
When you use materials that have a local significance,

185
0:09:55.3,000 --> 0:09:57,000
you prevent cities from all looking the same.

186
0:09:58.58,000 --> 0:10:,000
Copper has a long history in New York --

187
0:10:01.46,000 --> 0:10:02,000
the Statue of Liberty,

188
0:10:03.54,000 --> 0:10:04,000
the crown of the Woolworth Building --

189
0:10:06.02,000 --> 0:10:09,000
but it fell out of fashion for a long time

190
0:10:09.22,000 --> 0:10:13,000
until SHoP Architects used it to cover the American Copper Building,

191
0:10:13.62,000 --> 0:10:15,000
a pair of twisting towers on the East River.

192
0:10:16.98,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It's not even finished

193
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and you can see the way sunset lights up that metallic facade,

194
0:10:22.38,000 --> 0:10:24,000
which will weather to green as it ages.

195
0:10:25.54,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Buildings can be like people.

196
0:10:27.86,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Their faces broadcast their experience.

197
0:10:31.22,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And that's an important point,

198
0:10:32.7,000 --> 0:10:34,000
because when glass ages,

199
0:10:35.62,000 --> 0:10:36,000
you just replace it,

200
0:10:37.14,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and the building looks pretty much the same way it did before

201
0:10:40.06,000 --> 0:10:41,000
until eventually it's demolished.

202
0:10:41.78,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Almost all other materials have the ability

203
0:10:44.58,000 --> 0:10:47,000
to absorb infusions of history and memory,

204
0:10:48.18,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and project it into the present.

205
0:10:52.66,000 --> 0:10:53,000
The firm Ennead

206
0:10:54.54,000 --> 0:10:58,000
clad the Utah Natural History Museum in Salt Lake City in copper and zinc,

207
0:10:59.46,000 --> 0:11:03,000
ores that have been mined in the area for 150 years

208
0:11:05.1,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and that also camouflage the building against the ochre hills

209
0:11:09.18,000 --> 0:11:11,000
so that you have a natural history museum

210
0:11:11.5,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that reflects the region's natural history.

211
0:11:15.5,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And when the Chinese Pritzker Prize winner Wang Shu

212
0:11:18.3,000 --> 0:11:21,000
was building a history museum in Ningbo,

213
0:11:21.66,000 --> 0:11:24,000
he didn't just create a wrapper for the past,

214
0:11:24.9,000 --> 0:11:27,000
he built memory right into the walls

215
0:11:27.98,000 --> 0:11:3,000
by using brick and stones and shingles

216
0:11:31.7,000 --> 0:11:33,000
salvaged from villages that had been demolished.

217
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Now, architects can use glass

218
0:11:39.14,000 --> 0:11:41,000
in equally lyrical and inventive ways.

219
0:11:41.94,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Here in New York, two buildings,

220
0:11:43.66,000 --> 0:11:45,000
one by Jean Nouvel and this one by Frank Gehry

221
0:11:46.98,000 --> 0:11:47,000
face off across West 19th Street,

222
0:11:49.62,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and the play of reflections that they toss back and forth

223
0:11:52.58,000 --> 0:11:53,000
is like a symphony in light.

224
0:11:56.1,000 --> 0:11:59,000
But when a city defaults to glass

225
0:11:59.14,000 --> 0:12:,000
as it grows,

226
0:12:00.66,000 --> 0:12:01,000
it becomes a hall of mirrors,

227
0:12:02.9,000 --> 0:12:04,000
disquieting and cold.

228
0:12:05.82,000 --> 0:12:08,000
After all, cities are places of concentrated variety

229
0:12:11.5,000 --> 0:12:16,000
where the world's cultures and languages and lifestyles

230
0:12:16.54,000 --> 0:12:17,000
come together and mingle.

231
0:12:18.82,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So rather than encase all that variety

232
0:12:22.62,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and diversity in buildings of crushing sameness,

233
0:12:26.62,000 --> 0:12:3,000
we should have an architecture that honors the full range of the urban experience.

234
0:12:31.82,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Thank you.

235
0:12:33.06,000 --> 0:12:38,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.11,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'm a veteran of the starship Enterprise.

2
0:00:16.539,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I soared through the galaxy

3
0:00:19.899,000 --> 0:00:21,000
driving a huge starship

4
0:00:22.635,000 --> 0:00:23,000
with a crew made up of people

5
0:00:24.034,000 --> 0:00:26,000
from all over this world,

6
0:00:26.97,000 --> 0:00:29,000
many different races, many different cultures,

7
0:00:30.42,000 --> 0:00:31,000
many different heritages,

8
0:00:32.264,000 --> 0:00:33,000
all working together,

9
0:00:34.221,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and our mission was to explore strange new worlds,

10
0:00:37.866,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to seek out new life and new civilizations,

11
0:00:41.742,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to boldly go where no one has gone before.

12
0:00:46.705,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Well —

13
0:00:48.19,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Applause) —

14
0:00:54.906,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I am the grandson of immigrants from Japan

15
0:00:59.561,000 --> 0:01:01,000
who went to America,

16
0:01:01.692,000 --> 0:01:04,000
boldly going to a strange new world,

17
0:01:05.177,000 --> 0:01:07,000
seeking new opportunities.

18
0:01:08.013,000 --> 0:01:11,000
My mother was born in Sacramento, California.

19
0:01:11.499,000 --> 0:01:13,000
My father was a San Franciscan.

20
0:01:13.94,000 --> 0:01:15,000
They met and married in Los Angeles,

21
0:01:16.685,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and I was born there.

22
0:01:20.406,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I was four years old

23
0:01:22.659,000 --> 0:01:23,000
when Pearl Harbor was bombed

24
0:01:24.489,000 --> 0:01:28,000
on December 7, 1941 by Japan,

25
0:01:29.231,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and overnight, the world was plunged

26
0:01:33.24,000 --> 0:01:36,000
into a world war.

27
0:01:36.674,000 --> 0:01:38,000
America suddenly was swept up

28
0:01:39.627,000 --> 0:01:42,000
by hysteria.

29
0:01:43.551,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Japanese-Americans,

30
0:01:45.025,000 --> 0:01:48,000
American citizens of Japanese ancestry,

31
0:01:48.185,000 --> 0:01:49,000
were looked on

32
0:01:49.52,000 --> 0:01:53,000
with suspicion and fear

33
0:01:53.542,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and with outright hatred

34
0:01:56.514,000 --> 0:01:58,000
simply because we happened to look like

35
0:01:59.174,000 --> 0:02:01,000
the people that bombed Pearl Harbor.

36
0:02:01.87,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And the hysteria grew and grew

37
0:02:05.34,000 --> 0:02:08,000
until in February 1942,

38
0:02:08.93,000 --> 0:02:1,000
the president of the United States,

39
0:02:11.074,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Franklin Delano Roosevelt,

40
0:02:13.244,000 --> 0:02:15,000
ordered all Japanese-Americans

41
0:02:15.917,000 --> 0:02:17,000
on the West Coast of America

42
0:02:18.026,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to be summarily rounded up

43
0:02:20.942,000 --> 0:02:23,000
with no charges, with no trial,

44
0:02:24.147,000 --> 0:02:26,000
with no due process.

45
0:02:26.574,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Due process, this is a core pillar

46
0:02:29.165,000 --> 0:02:3,000
of our justice system.

47
0:02:30.778,000 --> 0:02:32,000
That all disappeared.

48
0:02:33.207,000 --> 0:02:35,000
We were to be rounded up

49
0:02:35.306,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and imprisoned in 10 barbed-wire prison camps

50
0:02:39.567,000 --> 0:02:43,000
in some of the most desolate places in America:

51
0:02:43.759,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the blistering hot desert of Arizona,

52
0:02:47.186,000 --> 0:02:5,000
the sultry swamps of Arkansas,

53
0:02:50.651,000 --> 0:02:53,000
the wastelands of Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Colorado,

54
0:02:54.344,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and two of the most desolate places in California.

55
0:02:59.778,000 --> 0:03:03,000
On April 20th, I celebrated my fifth birthday,

56
0:03:04.546,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and just a few weeks after my birthday,

57
0:03:08.163,000 --> 0:03:1,000
my parents got my younger brother,

58
0:03:10.934,000 --> 0:03:12,000
my baby sister and me

59
0:03:12.992,000 --> 0:03:14,000
up very early one morning,

60
0:03:15.021,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and they dressed us hurriedly.

61
0:03:18.246,000 --> 0:03:19,000
My brother and I were in the living room

62
0:03:20.24,000 --> 0:03:23,000
looking out the front window,

63
0:03:23.303,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and we saw two soldiers marching up our driveway.

64
0:03:27.147,000 --> 0:03:31,000
They carried bayonets on their rifles.

65
0:03:31.669,000 --> 0:03:33,000
They stomped up the front porch

66
0:03:34.47,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and banged on the door.

67
0:03:36.989,000 --> 0:03:38,000
My father answered it,

68
0:03:39.094,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and the soldiers ordered us out of our home.

69
0:03:43.835,000 --> 0:03:45,000
My father gave my brother and me

70
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
small luggages to carry,

71
0:03:47.902,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and we walked out and stood on the driveway

72
0:03:51.418,000 --> 0:03:53,000
waiting for our mother to come out,

73
0:03:54.413,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and when my mother finally came out,

74
0:03:57.728,000 --> 0:04:,000
she had our baby sister in one arm,

75
0:04:00.791,000 --> 0:04:03,000
a huge duffel bag in the other,

76
0:04:04.163,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and tears were streaming down both her cheeks.

77
0:04:09.305,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I will never be able to forget that scene.

78
0:04:13.092,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It is burned into my memory.

79
0:04:17.44,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We were taken from our home

80
0:04:20.231,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and loaded on to train cars

81
0:04:22.749,000 --> 0:04:25,000
with other Japanese-American families.

82
0:04:25.759,000 --> 0:04:26,000
There were guards stationed

83
0:04:27.239,000 --> 0:04:3,000
at both ends of each car,

84
0:04:30.699,000 --> 0:04:32,000
as if we were criminals.

85
0:04:33.398,000 --> 0:04:37,000
We were taken two thirds of the way across the country,

86
0:04:37.555,000 --> 0:04:41,000
rocking on that train for four days and three nights,

87
0:04:41.767,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to the swamps of Arkansas.

88
0:04:45.502,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I still remember the barbed wire fence

89
0:04:47.515,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that confined me.

90
0:04:50.125,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I remember the tall sentry tower

91
0:04:52.712,000 --> 0:04:56,000
with the machine guns pointed at us.

92
0:04:56.965,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I remember the searchlight that followed me

93
0:04:59.654,000 --> 0:05:,000
when I made the night runs

94
0:05:01.093,000 --> 0:05:04,000
from my barrack to the latrine.

95
0:05:04.344,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But to five-year-old me,

96
0:05:06.504,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I thought it was kind of nice that they'd lit the way

97
0:05:08.8,000 --> 0:05:11,000
for me to pee.

98
0:05:12.054,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I was a child,

99
0:05:13.947,000 --> 0:05:15,000
too young to understand the circumstances

100
0:05:16.572,000 --> 0:05:18,000
of my being there.

101
0:05:19.003,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Children are amazingly adaptable.

102
0:05:23.769,000 --> 0:05:26,000
What would be grotesquely abnormal

103
0:05:27.326,000 --> 0:05:29,000
became my normality

104
0:05:30.18,000 --> 0:05:33,000
in the prisoner of war camps.

105
0:05:33.794,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It became routine for me to line up three times a day

106
0:05:37.484,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to eat lousy food in a noisy mess hall.

107
0:05:42.231,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It became normal for me to go with my father

108
0:05:44.436,000 --> 0:05:46,000
to bathe in a mass shower.

109
0:05:47.384,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Being in a prison, a barbed-wire prison camp,

110
0:05:51.645,000 --> 0:05:54,000
became my normality.

111
0:05:55.269,000 --> 0:05:56,000
When the war ended,

112
0:05:56.91,000 --> 0:05:58,000
we were released,

113
0:05:58.962,000 --> 0:06:,000
and given a one-way ticket

114
0:06:00.968,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to anywhere in the United States.

115
0:06:04.534,000 --> 0:06:05,000
My parents decided to go back home

116
0:06:06.435,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to Los Angeles,

117
0:06:09.003,000 --> 0:06:13,000
but Los Angeles was not a welcoming place.

118
0:06:13.384,000 --> 0:06:14,000
We were penniless.

119
0:06:14.78,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Everything had been taken from us,

120
0:06:17.256,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and the hostility was intense.

121
0:06:19.689,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Our first home was on Skid Row

122
0:06:22.54,000 --> 0:06:26,000
in the lowest part of our city,

123
0:06:27.493,000 --> 0:06:29,000
living with derelicts, drunkards

124
0:06:30.06,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and crazy people,

125
0:06:32.08,000 --> 0:06:34,000
the stench of urine all over,

126
0:06:34.674,000 --> 0:06:37,000
on the street, in the alley,

127
0:06:37.787,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in the hallway.

128
0:06:40.108,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It was a horrible experience,

129
0:06:42.81,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and for us kids, it was terrorizing.

130
0:06:46.226,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I remember once

131
0:06:48.738,000 --> 0:06:5,000
a drunkard came staggering down,

132
0:06:51.69,000 --> 0:06:53,000
fell down right in front of us,

133
0:06:54.207,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and threw up.

134
0:06:55.857,000 --> 0:07:,000
My baby sister said, "Mama, let's go back home,"

135
0:07:01.174,000 --> 0:07:03,000
because behind barbed wires

136
0:07:03.48,000 --> 0:07:05,000
was for us

137
0:07:06.096,000 --> 0:07:08,000
home.

138
0:07:08.939,000 --> 0:07:09,000
My parents worked hard

139
0:07:10.59,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to get back on their feet.

140
0:07:12.547,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We had lost everything.

141
0:07:13.666,000 --> 0:07:15,000
They were at the middle of their lives

142
0:07:16.17,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and starting all over.

143
0:07:17.805,000 --> 0:07:19,000
They worked their fingers to the bone,

144
0:07:20.354,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and ultimately they were able

145
0:07:23.632,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to get the capital together to buy

146
0:07:26.12,000 --> 0:07:29,000
a three-bedroom home in a nice neighborhood.

147
0:07:29.285,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And I was a teenager,

148
0:07:30.876,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and I became very curious

149
0:07:32.67,000 --> 0:07:35,000
about my childhood imprisonment.

150
0:07:35.94,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I had read civics books that told me about

151
0:07:38.98,000 --> 0:07:41,000
the ideals of American democracy.

152
0:07:42.691,000 --> 0:07:44,000
All men are created equal,

153
0:07:45.356,000 --> 0:07:47,000
we have an inalienable right

154
0:07:48.267,000 --> 0:07:52,000
to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,

155
0:07:53.206,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and I couldn't quite make that fit

156
0:07:55.44,000 --> 0:07:58,000
with what I knew to be my childhood imprisonment.

157
0:07:58.829,000 --> 0:08:,000
I read history books,

158
0:08:00.91,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and I couldn't find anything about it.

159
0:08:03.781,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And so I engaged my father after dinner

160
0:08:07.685,000 --> 0:08:11,000
in long, sometimes heated conversations.

161
0:08:12.245,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We had many, many conversations like that,

162
0:08:15.013,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and what I got from them

163
0:08:17.792,000 --> 0:08:19,000
was my father's wisdom.

164
0:08:19.982,000 --> 0:08:21,000
He was the one that suffered the most

165
0:08:22.294,000 --> 0:08:25,000
under those conditions of imprisonment,

166
0:08:25.76,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and yet he understood American democracy.

167
0:08:29.737,000 --> 0:08:31,000
He told me that our democracy

168
0:08:32.464,000 --> 0:08:34,000
is a people's democracy,

169
0:08:34.571,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and it can be as great as the people can be,

170
0:08:37.63,000 --> 0:08:42,000
but it is also as fallible as people are.

171
0:08:42.821,000 --> 0:08:44,000
He told me that American democracy

172
0:08:45.081,000 --> 0:08:48,000
is vitally dependent on good people

173
0:08:49.077,000 --> 0:08:52,000
who cherish the ideals of our system

174
0:08:53.048,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and actively engage in the process

175
0:08:56.548,000 --> 0:08:58,000
of making our democracy work.

176
0:08:59.278,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And he took me to a campaign headquarters —

177
0:09:03.343,000 --> 0:09:06,000
the governor of Illinois was running for the presidency —

178
0:09:07.134,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and introduced me to American electoral politics.

179
0:09:11.822,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And he also told me about

180
0:09:14.183,000 --> 0:09:15,000
young Japanese-Americans

181
0:09:15.961,000 --> 0:09:18,000
during the Second World War.

182
0:09:19.021,000 --> 0:09:21,000
When Pearl Harbor was bombed,

183
0:09:21.825,000 --> 0:09:23,000
young Japanese-Americans, like all young Americans,

184
0:09:24.806,000 --> 0:09:26,000
rushed to their draft board

185
0:09:27.304,000 --> 0:09:3,000
to volunteer to fight for our country.

186
0:09:30.712,000 --> 0:09:32,000
That act of patriotism

187
0:09:33.144,000 --> 0:09:37,000
was answered with a slap in the face.

188
0:09:37.462,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We were denied service,

189
0:09:40.466,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and categorized as enemy non-alien.

190
0:09:46.328,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It was outrageous to be called an enemy

191
0:09:49.372,000 --> 0:09:52,000
when you're volunteering to fight for your country,

192
0:09:52.59,000 --> 0:09:56,000
but that was compounded with the word "non-alien,"

193
0:09:56.96,000 --> 0:09:59,000
which is a word that means

194
0:10:00.07,000 --> 0:10:04,000
"citizen" in the negative.

195
0:10:04.111,000 --> 0:10:07,000
They even took the word "citizen" away from us,

196
0:10:07.761,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and imprisoned them for a whole year.

197
0:10:12.389,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And then the government realized

198
0:10:14.377,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that there's a wartime manpower shortage,

199
0:10:18.747,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and as suddenly as they'd rounded us up,

200
0:10:23.126,000 --> 0:10:25,000
they opened up the military for service

201
0:10:25.253,000 --> 0:10:27,000
by young Japanese-Americans.

202
0:10:28.171,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It was totally irrational,

203
0:10:30.838,000 --> 0:10:32,000
but the amazing thing,

204
0:10:33.072,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the astounding thing,

205
0:10:35.429,000 --> 0:10:36,000
is that thousands of young

206
0:10:37.382,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Japanese-American men and women

207
0:10:40.34,000 --> 0:10:43,000
again went from behind those barbed-wire fences,

208
0:10:44.303,000 --> 0:10:47,000
put on the same uniform as that of our guards,

209
0:10:47.76,000 --> 0:10:5,000
leaving their families in imprisonment,

210
0:10:51.288,000 --> 0:10:53,000
to fight for this country.

211
0:10:53.602,000 --> 0:10:54,000
They said that they were going to fight

212
0:10:55.563,000 --> 0:10:58,000
not only to get their families out

213
0:10:58.829,000 --> 0:11:,000
from behind those barbed-wire fences,

214
0:11:01.387,000 --> 0:11:04,000
but because they cherished the very ideal

215
0:11:04.617,000 --> 0:11:06,000
of what our government stands for,

216
0:11:06.84,000 --> 0:11:07,000
should stand for,

217
0:11:08.731,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and that was being abrogated

218
0:11:11.232,000 --> 0:11:14,000
by what was being done.

219
0:11:15.145,000 --> 0:11:17,000
All men are created equal.

220
0:11:17.479,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And they went to fight for this country.

221
0:11:21.3,000 --> 0:11:22,000
They were put into a segregated

222
0:11:22.98,000 --> 0:11:24,000
all Japanese-American unit

223
0:11:25.202,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and sent to the battlefields of Europe,

224
0:11:27.826,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and they threw themselves into it.

225
0:11:30.897,000 --> 0:11:32,000
They fought with amazing,

226
0:11:33.742,000 --> 0:11:36,000
incredible courage and valor.

227
0:11:37.2,000 --> 0:11:4,000
They were sent out on the most dangerous missions

228
0:11:40.962,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and they sustained the highest combat casualty rate

229
0:11:43.843,000 --> 0:11:46,000
of any unit proportionally.

230
0:11:47.649,000 --> 0:11:5,000
There is one battle that illustrates that.

231
0:11:50.944,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It was a battle for the Gothic Line.

232
0:11:53.988,000 --> 0:11:55,000
The Germans were embedded

233
0:11:56.29,000 --> 0:11:58,000
in this mountain hillside,

234
0:11:58.877,000 --> 0:11:59,000
rocky hillside,

235
0:12:00.449,000 --> 0:12:02,000
in impregnable caves,

236
0:12:02.929,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and three allied battalions

237
0:12:06.2,000 --> 0:12:07,000
had been pounding away at it

238
0:12:07.978,000 --> 0:12:08,000
for six months,

239
0:12:09.462,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and they were stalemated.

240
0:12:11.892,000 --> 0:12:13,000
The 442nd was called in

241
0:12:14.786,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to add to the fight,

242
0:12:18.108,000 --> 0:12:2,000
but the men of the 442nd

243
0:12:20.274,000 --> 0:12:23,000
came up with a unique

244
0:12:23.434,000 --> 0:12:25,000
but dangerous idea:

245
0:12:25.734,000 --> 0:12:26,000
The backside of the mountain

246
0:12:27.529,000 --> 0:12:29,000
was a sheer rock cliff.

247
0:12:30.19,000 --> 0:12:33,000
The Germans thought an attack from the backside

248
0:12:33.599,000 --> 0:12:35,000
would be impossible.

249
0:12:36.109,000 --> 0:12:4,000
The men of the 442nd decided to do the impossible.

250
0:12:40.48,000 --> 0:12:43,000
On a dark, moonless night,

251
0:12:44.223,000 --> 0:12:48,000
they began scaling that rock wall,

252
0:12:48.471,000 --> 0:12:51,000
a drop of more than 1,000 feet,

253
0:12:52.09,000 --> 0:12:54,000
in full combat gear.

254
0:12:54.737,000 --> 0:12:56,000
They climbed all night long

255
0:12:57.581,000 --> 0:13:,000
on that sheer cliff.

256
0:13:02.279,000 --> 0:13:03,000
In the darkness,

257
0:13:04.232,000 --> 0:13:06,000
some lost their handhold

258
0:13:06.312,000 --> 0:13:07,000
or their footing

259
0:13:07.925,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and they fell to their deaths

260
0:13:10.122,000 --> 0:13:12,000
in the ravine below.

261
0:13:12.203,000 --> 0:13:16,000
They all fell silently.

262
0:13:16.63,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Not a single one cried out,

263
0:13:19.195,000 --> 0:13:22,000
so as not to give their position away.

264
0:13:22.427,000 --> 0:13:25,000
The men climbed for eight hours straight,

265
0:13:26.285,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and those who made it to the top

266
0:13:29.404,000 --> 0:13:33,000
stayed there until the first break of light,

267
0:13:33.886,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and as soon as light broke,

268
0:13:36.965,000 --> 0:13:37,000
they attacked.

269
0:13:38.558,000 --> 0:13:39,000
The Germans were surprised,

270
0:13:40.212,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and they took the hill

271
0:13:41.96,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and broke the Gothic Line.

272
0:13:44.97,000 --> 0:13:46,000
A six-month stalemate

273
0:13:47.258,000 --> 0:13:49,000
was broken by the 442nd

274
0:13:49.463,000 --> 0:13:51,000
in 32 minutes.

275
0:13:52.444,000 --> 0:13:55,000
It was an amazing act,

276
0:13:56.08,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and when the war ended,

277
0:13:58.93,000 --> 0:14:01,000
the 442nd returned to the United States

278
0:14:02.147,000 --> 0:14:04,000
as the most decorated unit

279
0:14:04.563,000 --> 0:14:06,000
of the entire Second World War.

280
0:14:07.48,000 --> 0:14:09,000
They were greeted back on the White House Lawn

281
0:14:10.21,000 --> 0:14:12,000
by President Truman, who said to them,

282
0:14:12.816,000 --> 0:14:15,000
"You fought not only the enemy

283
0:14:16.074,000 --> 0:14:2,000
but prejudice, and you won."

284
0:14:20.694,000 --> 0:14:23,000
They are my heroes.

285
0:14:24.29,000 --> 0:14:27,000
They clung to their belief

286
0:14:27.337,000 --> 0:14:3,000
in the shining ideals of this country,

287
0:14:30.389,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and they proved that being an American

288
0:14:34.68,000 --> 0:14:37,000
is not just for some people,

289
0:14:37.89,000 --> 0:14:42,000
that race is not how we define being an American.

290
0:14:43.323,000 --> 0:14:46,000
They expanded what it means to be an American,

291
0:14:46.9,000 --> 0:14:48,000
including Japanese-Americans

292
0:14:49.224,000 --> 0:14:53,000
that were feared and suspected and hated.

293
0:14:53.398,000 --> 0:14:56,000
They were change agents,

294
0:14:56.609,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and they left for me

295
0:14:59.091,000 --> 0:15:01,000
a legacy.

296
0:15:01.308,000 --> 0:15:02,000
They are my heroes

297
0:15:03.097,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and my father is my hero,

298
0:15:05.448,000 --> 0:15:06,000
who understood democracy

299
0:15:07.258,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and guided me through it.

300
0:15:11.329,000 --> 0:15:13,000
They gave me a legacy,

301
0:15:13.819,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and with that legacy comes a responsibility,

302
0:15:17.181,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and I am dedicated

303
0:15:19.597,000 --> 0:15:2,000
to making my country

304
0:15:21.586,000 --> 0:15:24,000
an even better America,

305
0:15:24.79,000 --> 0:15:26,000
to making our government

306
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:3,000
an even truer democracy,

307
0:15:30.497,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and because of the heroes that I have

308
0:15:34.237,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and the struggles that we've gone through,

309
0:15:37.859,000 --> 0:15:38,000
I can stand before you

310
0:15:39.858,000 --> 0:15:41,000
as a gay Japanese-American,

311
0:15:42.717,000 --> 0:15:44,000
but even more than that,

312
0:15:45.184,000 --> 0:15:49,000
I am a proud American.

313
0:15:49.192,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Thank you very much.

314
0:15:51.379,000 --> 0:15:52,000
(Applause)

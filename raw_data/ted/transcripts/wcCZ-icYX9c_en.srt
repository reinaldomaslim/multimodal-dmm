1
0:00:12.866,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So, as a child,

2
0:00:14.364,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I used to spend all of my time at my great-grandmother's house.

3
0:00:17.914,000 --> 0:00:2,000
On hot, humid, summer days, I would dash across the floor

4
0:00:21.141,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and stick my face in front of her only air conditioner.

5
0:00:24.698,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But I didn't realize that that simple experience,

6
0:00:27.887,000 --> 0:00:28,000
though brief,

7
0:00:29.435,000 --> 0:00:31,000
was a privileged one in our community.

8
0:00:32.533,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Growing up, stories of next-door neighbors having to set up fake energy accounts

9
0:00:36.714,000 --> 0:00:37,000
or having to steal energy

10
0:00:38.376,000 --> 0:00:39,000
seemed normal to me.

11
0:00:40.46,000 --> 0:00:42,000
During the winter, struggling to get warm,

12
0:00:42.575,000 --> 0:00:44,000
my neighbors would have no choice but to bypass the meter

13
0:00:45.455,000 --> 0:00:46,000
after their heat was shut off,

14
0:00:47.373,000 --> 0:00:5,000
just to keep their family comfortable for one more day.

15
0:00:52.073,000 --> 0:00:54,000
These kinds of dangerous incidents can take root

16
0:00:54.675,000 --> 0:00:56,000
when people are faced with impossible choices.

17
0:00:57.772,000 --> 0:01:01,000
In the US, the average American spends three percent of their income on energy.

18
0:01:02.483,000 --> 0:01:05,000
In contrast, low-income and rural populations

19
0:01:05.731,000 --> 0:01:09,000
can spend 20, even 30 percent of their income on energy.

20
0:01:10.6,000 --> 0:01:14,000
In 2015, this caused over 25 million people to skip meals

21
0:01:15.545,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to provide power to their homes.

22
0:01:18.23,000 --> 0:01:2,000
This is when energy becomes a burden.

23
0:01:21.173,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But energy burdens are so much more than just a number.

24
0:01:24.673,000 --> 0:01:28,000
They present impossible and perilous choices:

25
0:01:29.377,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Do you take your child to get her flu medicine,

26
0:01:31.851,000 --> 0:01:32,000
or do you feed her?

27
0:01:34.44,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Or do you keep her warm?

28
0:01:36.503,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It's an impossible choice,

29
0:01:38.293,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and nearly every month,

30
0:01:40.208,000 --> 0:01:44,000
seven million people choose between medicine and energy.

31
0:01:45.248,000 --> 0:01:48,000
This exposes a much larger and systemic issue.

32
0:01:48.751,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Families with high energy burdens are disproportionately people of color,

33
0:01:53.026,000 --> 0:01:56,000
who spend more per square foot than their white counterparts.

34
0:01:56.897,000 --> 0:01:58,000
But it's also nurses, veterans and even schoolteachers

35
0:01:59.857,000 --> 0:02:02,000
who fall into the mass of 37 million people a year

36
0:02:03.368,000 --> 0:02:06,000
who are unable to afford energy for their most basic needs.

37
0:02:07.69,000 --> 0:02:09,000
As a result, those with high energy burdens

38
0:02:09.972,000 --> 0:02:12,000
have a greater likelihood of conditions like heart disease and asthma.

39
0:02:14.561,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Look -- given our rockets to Mars and our pocket-sized AI,

40
0:02:19.845,000 --> 0:02:22,000
we have the tools to address these systemic inequities.

41
0:02:23.411,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The technology is here.

42
0:02:25.621,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Cost of renewables, insulation, microgrids and smart home technology

43
0:02:29.542,000 --> 0:02:3,000
are all decreasing.

44
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
However, even as we approach cost parity,

45
0:02:34.292,000 --> 0:02:39,000
the majority of those who own solar earn much more than the average American.

46
0:02:40.411,000 --> 0:02:43,000
This is why, when I was 22, I founded the nonprofit RETI.

47
0:02:44.154,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens by working with communities,

48
0:02:48.907,000 --> 0:02:5,000
utilities and government agencies alike

49
0:02:51.485,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to provide equitable access to clean energy,

50
0:02:54.385,000 --> 0:02:56,000
energy efficiency and energy technology.

51
0:02:57.555,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But there's no one way to solve this.

52
0:03:01.269,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I believe in the power of local communities,

53
0:03:05.837,000 --> 0:03:07,000
in the transforming effect of relationships.

54
0:03:09.264,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So we start by working directly with the communities

55
0:03:12.504,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that have the highest energy burdens.

56
0:03:14.578,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We host workshops and events for communities

57
0:03:16.712,000 --> 0:03:17,000
to learn about energy poverty,

58
0:03:18.183,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and how making even small updates to their homes

59
0:03:20.813,000 --> 0:03:22,000
like better insulation for windows and water heaters

60
0:03:23.423,000 --> 0:03:25,000
can go a long way to maximize efficiency.

61
0:03:26.232,000 --> 0:03:28,000
We're connecting neighborhoods to community solar

62
0:03:29.114,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and spearheading community-led smart home research

63
0:03:31.875,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and installation programs

64
0:03:33.598,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to help families bring down their energy bills.

65
0:03:36.445,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We're even working directly with elected officials,

66
0:03:39.019,000 --> 0:03:41,000
advocating for more equitable pricing,

67
0:03:41.761,000 --> 0:03:46,000
because to see this vision of energy equity and resilience succeed,

68
0:03:46.923,000 --> 0:03:49,000
we have to work together sustainably.

69
0:03:51.054,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Now, the US spends over three billion a year

70
0:03:53.575,000 --> 0:03:55,000
on energy bill payment assistance.

71
0:03:55.81,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And these programs do help millions of people,

72
0:03:58.782,000 --> 0:04:01,000
but they're only able to help a fraction of those in need.

73
0:04:02.052,000 --> 0:04:03,000
In fact,

74
0:04:03.291,000 --> 0:04:08,000
there is a 47-billion-dollar home-energy affordability gap,

75
0:04:09.041,000 --> 0:04:12,000
so assistance alone is not sustainable.

76
0:04:13.194,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But by building energy equity and resilience into our communities,

77
0:04:17.487,000 --> 0:04:19,000
we can assure fair and impartial access

78
0:04:20.411,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to energy that is clean, reliable and affordable.

79
0:04:23.454,000 --> 0:04:27,000
At scale, microgrid technology, clean technology and energy efficiency

80
0:04:28.47,000 --> 0:04:3,000
dramatically improve public health.

81
0:04:30.974,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And for those with high energy burdens,

82
0:04:33.406,000 --> 0:04:36,000
it can help them reclaim 20 percent of their income --

83
0:04:37.049,000 --> 0:04:4,000
20 percent of a person's income who's struggling to make ends meet.

84
0:04:41.001,000 --> 0:04:42,000
This is life-changing.

85
0:04:43.432,000 --> 0:04:47,000
This is an opportunity for families to use their energy savings

86
0:04:48.452,000 --> 0:04:49,000
to sponsor their future.

87
0:04:51.093,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I think back to my great-grandmother and her neighbors,

88
0:04:55.732,000 --> 0:04:58,000
the impossible choices that they had to make

89
0:04:58.988,000 --> 0:05:,000
and the effect it had on our whole community.

90
0:05:01.93,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But this is not just about them.

91
0:05:04.455,000 --> 0:05:09,000
There are millions nationwide having to make the same impossible choices today.

92
0:05:09.889,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And I know high energy burdens are a tremendous barrier to overcome,

93
0:05:14.046,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but through relationships with communities and technology,

94
0:05:18.463,000 --> 0:05:2,000
we have the paths to overcome them.

95
0:05:21.164,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And when we do,

96
0:05:23.183,000 --> 0:05:24,000
we will all be more resilient.

97
0:05:25.398,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Thank you.

98
0:05:26.573,000 --> 0:05:28,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm a neuroscientist, a professor at the University of California.

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And over the past 35 years,

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I've studied behavior

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
on the basis of everything from genes

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
through neurotransmitters, dopamine, things like that,

6
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
all the way through circuit analysis.

7
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So that's what I normally do.

8
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But then, for some reason,

9
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I got into something else, just recently.

10
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And it all grew out of one of my colleagues asking me

11
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
to analyze a bunch of brains

12
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
of psychopathic killers.

13
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And so this would be the typical talk I would give.

14
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And the question is, "How do you end up with a psychopathic killer?"

15
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
What I mean by psychopathic killer

16
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
are these people, these types of people.

17
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And so some of the brains that I've studied

18
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
are people you know about.

19
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
When I get the brains I don't know what I'm looking at.

20
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It's blind experiments. They also gave me normal people and everything.

21
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So I've looked at about 70 of these.

22
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And what came up was a number of pieces of data.

23
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So we look at these sorts of things theoretically,

24
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
on the basis of genetics,

25
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and brain damage, and interaction with environment,

26
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and exactly how that machine works.

27
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So we're interested in exactly where in the brain,

28
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and what's the most important part of the brain.

29
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So we've been looking at this:

30
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
the interaction of genes,

31
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
what's called epigenetic effects,

32
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
brain damage, and environment,

33
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and how these are tied together.

34
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And how you end up with a psychopath, and a killer,

35
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
depends on exactly when the damage occurs.

36
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It's really a very precisely timed thing.

37
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
You get different kinds of psychopaths.

38
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So we're going along with this. And here's, just to give you the pattern.

39
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The pattern is that those people, every one of them I looked at,

40
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
who was a murderer, and was a serial killer,

41
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
had damage to their orbital cortex,

42
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
which is right above the eyes, the orbits,

43
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and also the interior part of the temporal lobe.

44
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So there is the pattern that every one of them had,

45
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but they all were a little different too.

46
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
They had other sorts of brain damage.

47
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
A key thing is that

48
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
the major violence genes,

49
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
it's called the MAO-A gene.

50
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And there is a variant of this gene that is in the normal population.

51
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Some of you have this. And it's sex-linked.

52
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
It's on the X chromosome. And so in this way

53
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
you can only get it from your mother.

54
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And in fact this is probably why mostly men, boys,

55
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
are psychopathic killers,

56
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
or are very aggressive.

57
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Because a daughter can get one X from the father,

58
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
one X from the mother, it's kind of diluted out.

59
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But for a son, he can only get

60
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
the X chromosome from his mother.

61
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So this is how it's passed from mother to son.

62
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And it has to do with too much brain serotonin during development,

63
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
which is kind of interesting because serotonin

64
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
is supposed to make you calm and relaxed.

65
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But if you have this gene, in utero

66
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
your brain is bathed in this,

67
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
so your whole brain becomes insensitive to serotonin,

68
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
so it doesn't work later on in life.

69
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And I'd given this one talk in Israel,

70
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
just this past year.

71
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And it does have some consequences.

72
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Theoretically what this means

73
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
is that in order to express this gene,

74
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
in a violent way,

75
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
very early on, before puberty,

76
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
you have to be involved in something that is really traumatic --

77
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
not a little stress, not being spanked or something,

78
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
but really seeing violence,

79
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
or being involved in it, in 3D.

80
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Right? That's how the mirror neuron system works.

81
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And so, if you have that gene,

82
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and you see a lot of violence

83
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
in a certain situation,

84
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
this is the recipe for disaster, absolute disaster.

85
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And what I think might happen in these areas of the world,

86
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
where we have constant violence,

87
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
you end up having generations of kids

88
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that are seeing all this violence.

89
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And if I was a young girl, somewhere in a violent area,

90
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
you know, a 14 year old, and I want to find a mate,

91
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I'd find some tough guy, right, to protect me.

92
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Well what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes.

93
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And now the boys and the girls get them.

94
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So I think after several generations,

95
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and here is the idea, we really have a tinderbox.

96
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So that was the idea.

97
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But then my mother said to me, "I hear you've been going around talking

98
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
about psychopathic killers.

99
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And you're talking as if you come from a normal family."

100
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I said, "What the hell are you talking about?"

101
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
She then told me about our own family tree.

102
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Now she blamed this on my father's side, of course.

103
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This was one of these cases, because she has no violence in her background,

104
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but my father did.

105
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Well she said, "There is good news and bad news.

106
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
One of your cousins is Ezra Cornell, founder of Cornell university.

107
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But the bad news is that your cousin is also Lizzie Borden.

108
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Now I said, "Okay, so what? We have Lizzie."

109
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
She goes, "No it gets worse, read this book."

110
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And here is this "Killed Strangely," and it's this historical book.

111
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And the first murder

112
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
of a mother by a son

113
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
was my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.

114
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Okay, so that's the first case of matricide.

115
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And that book is very interesting. Because it's about witch trials,

116
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and how people thought back then.

117
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But it doesn't stop there.

118
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
There were seven more men, on my father's side,

119
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
starting then, Cornells, that were all murderers.

120
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Okay, now this gives one a little pause.

121
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Because my father himself,

123
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and my three uncles, in World War II,

124
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
were all conscientious objectors, all pussycats.

125
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But every once in a while, like Lizzie Borden, like three times a century,

126
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and we're kind of due.

127
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Laughter)

128
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So the moral of the story is:

129
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

130
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
But more likely is this.

131
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Laughter)

132
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And we had to take action. Now our kids found out about it.

133
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And they all seemed to be OK.

134
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But our grandkids are going to be kind of concerned here.

135
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So what we've done is I've started to do PET scans

136
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
of everybody in the family.

137
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Laughter)

138
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
We started to do PET scans, EEGs and genetic analysis

139
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to see where the bad news is.

140
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Now the only person -- it turns out

141
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
one son and one daughter, siblings,

142
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
didn't get along and their patterns are exactly the same.

143
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
They have the same brain, and the same EEG.

144
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And now they are close as can be.

145
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But there's gonna be bad news somewhere.

146
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And we don't know where it's going to pop up.

147
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So that's my talk.

148
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Laughter)

1
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
To understand the business of mythology

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and what a Chief Belief Officer is supposed to do,

3
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
you have to hear a story

4
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
of Ganesha,

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the elephant-headed god

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
who is the scribe of storytellers,

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and his brother,

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the athletic warlord of the gods,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Kartikeya.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The two brothers one day decided to go on a race,

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
three times around the world.

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Kartikeya leapt on his peacock

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and flew around the continents

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and the mountains and the oceans.

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
He went around once,

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
he went around twice,

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
he went around thrice.

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But his brother, Ganesha,

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
simply walked around his parents

20
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
once, twice, thrice,

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and said, "I won."

22
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
"How come?" said Kartikeya.

23
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And Ganesha said,

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
"You went around 'the world.'

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I went around 'my world.'"

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
What matters more?

27
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
If you understand the difference between 'the world' and 'my world,'

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
you understand the difference between logos and mythos.

29
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
'The world' is objective,

30
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
logical, universal, factual,

31
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
scientific.

32
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
'My world' is subjective.

33
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It's emotional. It's personal.

34
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
It's perceptions, thoughts, feelings, dreams.

35
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
It is the belief system that we carry.

36
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It's the myth that we live in.

37
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
'The world' tells us how the world functions,

38
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
how the sun rises,

39
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
how we are born.

40
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
'My world' tells us why the sun rises,

41
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
why we were born.

42
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Every culture is trying to understand itself:

43
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
"Why do we exist?"

44
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And every culture comes up with its own understanding of life,

45
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
its own customized version of mythology.

46
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Culture is a reaction to nature,

47
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and this understanding of our ancestors

48
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is transmitted generation from generation

49
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
in the form of stories, symbols and rituals,

50
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
which are always indifferent to rationality.

51
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And so, when you study it, you realize

52
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that different people of the world

53
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
have a different understanding of the world.

54
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Different people see things differently --

55
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
different viewpoints.

56
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
There is my world and there is your world,

57
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and my world is always better than your world,

58
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
because my world, you see, is rational

59
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and yours is superstition.

60
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Yours is faith.

61
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Yours is illogical.

62
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
This is the root of the clash of civilizations.

63
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It took place, once, in 326 B.C.

64
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
on the banks of a river called the Indus,

65
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
now in Pakistan.

66
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
This river lends itself to India's name.

67
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
India. Indus.

68
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Alexander, a young Macedonian,

69
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
met there what he called a "gymnosophist,"

70
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
which means "the naked, wise man."

71
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We don't know who he was.

72
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Perhaps he was a Jain monk,

73
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
like Bahubali over here,

74
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
the Gomateshwara Bahubali

75
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
whose image is not far from Mysore.

76
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Or perhaps he was just a yogi

77
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
who was sitting on a rock, staring at the sky

78
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and the sun and the moon.

79
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Alexander asked, "What are you doing?"

80
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and the gymnosophist answered,

81
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
"I'm experiencing nothingness."

82
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Then the gymnosophist asked,

83
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
"What are you doing?"

84
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and Alexander said, "I am conquering the world."

85
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And they both laughed.

86
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Each one thought that the other was a fool.

87
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The gymnosophist said, "Why is he conquering the world?

88
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
It's pointless."

89
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And Alexander thought,

90
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
"Why is he sitting around, doing nothing?

91
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
What a waste of a life."

92
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
To understand this difference in viewpoints,

93
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
we have to understand

94
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
the subjective truth of Alexander --

95
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
his myth, and the mythology that constructed it.

96
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Alexander's mother, his parents, his teacher Aristotle

97
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
told him the story of Homer's "Iliad."

98
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
They told him of a great hero called Achilles,

99
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
who, when he participated in battle, victory was assured,

100
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
but when he withdrew from the battle,

101
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
defeat was inevitable.

102
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"Achilles was a man who could shape history,

103
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
a man of destiny,

104
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and this is what you should be, Alexander."

105
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
That's what he heard.

106
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
"What should you not be?

107
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
You should not be Sisyphus,

108
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
who rolls a rock up a mountain all day

109
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
only to find the boulder rolled down at night.

110
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Don't live a life which is monotonous,

111
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
mediocre, meaningless.

112
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Be spectacular! --

113
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
like the Greek heroes,

114
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
like Jason, who went across the sea

115
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
with the Argonauts and fetched the Golden Fleece.

116
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Be spectacular like Theseus,

117
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
who entered the labyrinth and killed the bull-headed Minotaur.

118
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
When you play in a race, win! --

119
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
because when you win, the exhilaration of victory

120
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
is the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods."

121
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Because, you see, the Greeks believed

122
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
you live only once,

123
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and when you die, you have to cross the River Styx.

124
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And if you have lived an extraordinary life,

125
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
you will be welcomed to Elysium,

126
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
or what the French call "Champs-Élysées" --

127
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Laughter) --

128
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
the heaven of the heroes.

129
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard.

130
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
He heard a very different story.

131
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
He heard of a man called Bharat,

132
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000

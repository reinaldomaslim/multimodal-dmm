1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
My favorite topic is

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
shortcuts.

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The master of shortcuts -- it's, of course, nature.

4
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But I will demonstrate

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
different ways to get

6
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
rid of difficulties and go to the point,

7
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to find an answer

8
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
probably much quicker than Arthur did. So,

9
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
first,

10
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
we violate the common sense,

11
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
the logic. All of you, if you hold your hand like this,

12
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
90 degrees --

13
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
all of you. Not you.

14
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
All of you, right? Palm up.

15
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
If you do this,

16
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
the common, the logic says you must turn the wrist.

17
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Do you agree?

18
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Good.

19
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But I will first teach you

20
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
a method, how you can do it without

21
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
moving the wrist, and then the shortcut.

22
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
You can do it immediately, right?

23
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Hold the hand like this, palm up.

24
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Don't move the wrist. The wrist is --

25
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I doesn't speak very many, but I do the best, what I are.

26
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Right-molded you say, with iron?

27
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
That was a joke, actually,

28
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and I --

29
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
OK.

30
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Hold the hand palm up. Do this, don't move the wrist.

31
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Over the heart, don't move the wrist.

32
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Forward, don't move the wrist.

33
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Up, don't move the wrist. Over the heart, don't move the wrist.

34
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And forward. Yeah.

35
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Now --

36
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
(Laughter) --

37
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
logic, logically,

38
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
you have got to this position from this, without moving the wrist.

39
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Now, the shortcut.

41
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But it was six moves. Now with one move.

43
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I start here, palm down, you can follow.

44
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And then look at me.

45
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Yeah! (Laughter)

46
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
One move. OK.

47
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So,

48
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that was the warming up.

49
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now,

50
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I need an assistant.

51
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I talked to a nice girl before, Zoe.

52
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
She has left. No! A big hand.

53
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Applause)

54
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Good. Nice. And you can sit over there.

55
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
One item here was water, right?

56
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And I will give my tribute

57
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to water.

58
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I think it's enough with water for me. The other guys can talk about -- cheers.

59
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Laughter)

60
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Beer has about --

61
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
there's a lot of water in beer.

62
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So, now

64
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I will demonstrate different ways of

65
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
memorizing,

66
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
control cards and so on.

67
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And I think I'll take off this one.

68
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I work with a special

69
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
method to do it, quick.

70
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I work with

71
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
precision -- oh, sorry --

72
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
control

73
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and

74
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
a very powerful ...

75
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
memory system, right?

76
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
So,

78
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
if --

79
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I have studied the poker. I like to gamble.

80
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Officially, I don't gamble but ...

81
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So, if we are --

82
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
if we have five person,

83
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and I will do a five-handed poker game.

84
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Now I will interact. So a different person

85
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
all the time, so not the same person can answer.

86
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So we have an agreement.

87
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Which one shall have a good poker hand?

88
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Which number? One, two, three, four or five? (Audience: Three.)

89
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Lennart Green: Three -- good.

90
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And

91
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
here,

92
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I had a mat here to make it a little --

93
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
the critical moment is -- sorry.

94
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
If a card shark gathers the cards together,

95
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
immediately when he --

96
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
before he deals the card. Now,

97
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
so I think, number three,

98
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I have arranged them in a full house.

99
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
(Laughter)

100
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
With queens and -- it's OK --

101
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
queens and tens.

102
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
That's a challenge. I like this.

103
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I will explain later. One, two, three, four, five.

104
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I start with three queens.

105
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So here you see the contrast when I treat the cards.

106
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And two tens.

107
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Yeah. Thank you.

108
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Applause)

109
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
But also the other hand is good, if all the other guys have good hands too.

110
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So these guys have actually a stronger hand --

111
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
three aces and two kings.

112
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
This guy beats them with

113
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
four of a kind, or deuce -- deuce.

114
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
No reaction? That with even --

115
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
OK, and this.

116
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
These look in order, I'm probably -- hopefully --

117
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
yeah. Three, four, five, six, seven

118
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and ...

119
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But, of course, I will have the winning hand.

120
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Ten, jack,

121
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
queen, king, ace.

122
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Yeah. So,

123
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
good.

124
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Laughter)

125
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So the hand that looks so good from the beginning,

126
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
number three, at the end

127
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
was actually the lowest hand.

128
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Such life. Right?

129
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So, please mix them.

130
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Now, if you are interested, I will demonstrate some

131
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
underground techniques.

132
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Yes?

133
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I work with

134
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
kind of estimation,

135
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
shuffle tracking --

136
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
ah, good.

137
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Impressive. Thank you.

138
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Laughter)

139
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So, first,

140
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
the first term is estimation.

141
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Here, I can estimate exactly how many cards

142
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
are put between

143
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
my royal flush.

144
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Of course, I can count the cards, but this is much quicker.

145
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Right? You agree.

146
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So here I have, actually --

147
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I know exactly where the cards are.

148
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So here, I can make a bet,

149
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and this is actually one of the points where I get my money.

150
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So here: 10, jack,

151
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
queen, king, ace.

152
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
OK.

153
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
(Applause)

154
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Next

155
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
is a term --

156
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I do it quick. I call this stealing.

157
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So here, I think

158
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I know about where the cards are.

159
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I will spread the cards and you'll say stop,

160
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
when I point to them, right. Point, say stop.

161
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Zoe: Stop.

162
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
LG: Here -- you see some are missing?

163
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And that's the stealing cards, which I did.

164
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
(Laughter)

165
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
OK.

166
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Now, another term called shuffle tracking.

167
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Shuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards,

168
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
even if another person shuffles.

169
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
This is a little risky.

170
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So -- because if you look, now, I can still see it.

171
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
You agree? But if you square --

172
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
square, and shuffle,

173
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and then a cut.

174
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So here,

175
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to follow my cards, I must look at the shuffle from the begin --

176
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
ah, we are started together. It's OK, it's OK.

177
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Come to -- no, no, no, no.

178
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I'm joking, yeah?

179
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Any style -- yeah, good.

180
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Here I have to calculate, but actually, I don't like to calculate.

181
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I work direct with the right brain.

182
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
If you pass the left brain,

183
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
you have to take care of logic and common sense.

184
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Direct in the right brain, that's much better. And so --

185
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Laughter) --

186
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Arthur Benjamin did

187
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
a little of the same thing.

188
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And if you work with, in the right atmosphere, with humor,

189
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
you have -- that's the password

190
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
to the

191
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
cosmic bank of knowledge,

192
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
where you can find any solution of any problem.

193
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
OK. Now, I drop the cards,

194
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and you say stop anyway, right?

195
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Not at the last card.

196
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Zoe: Stop. LG: Yeah.

197
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
When I'm sober, I do this much quicker, but we will check.

198
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
(Laughter)

199
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Ah, not in order, it -- that was a mistake.

200
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
No, I'm kidding.

201
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Applause)

202
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
No, now and then I put in a mistake,

203
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
just to emphasize how difficult it is.

204
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Right?

205
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Yeah, last night I forgot that. That was a mistake.

206
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
But now I'm glad I remember it.

207
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So,

208
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
this deck is bought here. Sorry.

209
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I have a little pad

210
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to make it a little softer.

211
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
This deck is bought here in America.

212
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It's called

213
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
"Bicycle." And this deck is very flexible,

214
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
but not so many people know,

215
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
if you check, if you press at

216
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
the right spots,

217
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
you see how thin and flexible this deck is, right?

218
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Now, you can carry this in your wallet,

219
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
so ...

220
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
You don't see it, make no reaction?

221
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
(Laughter)

222
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So, but here,

223
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and --

224
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
is the camera getting too much? No.

225
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
(Laughter)

226
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
Yeah? (Audience: It's getting too much.)

227
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
LG: Pardon? But then, when we will have it back, you do this.

228
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
But not too much.

229
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Then you have to push it down again.

230
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Here, please. If you push these

231
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
heaps -- everyone see --

232
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
push them together so they are really interlaced,

233
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
right? Yeah, good.

234
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Perfect.

235
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Just push them through, good. Thank you.

236
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And then, I will demonstrate a thing from

237
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Russian satellite,

238
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
stealen -- stolen,

239
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
probably copied from America but we will see.

240
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Here --

241
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
shortcuts. I talk about shortcuts.

242
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Now I go very quick

243
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
through the deck and try to find some pattern.

244
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
The new chaos theory is already old, right?

245
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
But you know, I think you are

246
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
familiar with fractals --

247
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
the Mandelbrot spirals and all these things.

248
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And it's much

249
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
easier to memorize cards in a pattern way,

250
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and not concentrate. If you concentrate and calculate,

251
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
then you go to --

252
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
then it's the left brain. But if you just look and talk

253
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
in another language ...

254
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Yeah, great.

255
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
I think I have it.

256
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
So now, different persons, older, tap.

257
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Please name any card, anyone.

258
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
(Audience: Jack of spades.) LG: Jack of spades.

259
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Jack of spades.

260
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
I think jack of spades is number 12 from the top.

261
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

262
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
nine, 10, 11,

263
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
12. Yes, right.

264
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So -- oh, jack of spades.

265
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
You said spades? (Audience: Yes.) LG: Ah.

266
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
My fault. Don't applaud, this was clubs.

267
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
So, jack of spades.

268
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I think ...

269
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
23 --

270
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
24, sorry, 24.

271
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

272
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

273
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
18, 19, 20, 21, 22,

274
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
23 --

275
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
ah, 25, yes.

276
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
It's the last.

277
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Now, I do it quicker, better.

278
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
OK. Another person. Oh, I forgot, I shouldn't shuffle but I think --

279
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
(Laughter)

280
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
-- actually, my technique is to peek,

281
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
all the time.

282
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
When I lift the heap, I peek.

283
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
You see, yeah, perfect.

284
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Three, four, five, six. Then I calculate -- yeah, good.

285
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
(Laughter)

286
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Another person, another card. (Audience: Seven of diamonds.)

287
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
LG: Seven of diamonds. Perfect, my favorite, yeah, seven.

288
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
So I will do it quick,

289
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
very quick, but in slow motion, so you can follow.

290
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
(Laughter)

291
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Seven of? (Audience: Diamonds.)

292
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
LG: Diamonds, good. I start here.

293
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Good, thank you.

294
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
(Applause)

295
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
The thing I did -- I peeked.

296
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
I know where the card were,

297
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
then I chose it. So another person, another card.

298
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
(Laughter)

299
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Another person.

300
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
(Audience: Ten of diamonds.)

301
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
LG: Pardon?

302
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
(Audience: Ten of diamonds.)

303
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
LG: Ten of diamonds, yeah.

304
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I think I do it the same way. I like to,

305
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
so I know where it is.

306
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Ten of diamonds.

307
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
But now I do it the regular speed, right?

308
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Ten of diamonds.

309
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Good.

310
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Maybe you will cut? Lift.

311
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Excellent.

312
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
So, thank you. Another person, another card.

313
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
(Audience: Five of clubs.)

314
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
LG: Pardon? (Audience: Five of clubs.)

315
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
LG: Five of clubs. It's not the same person, even if it's the same spot.

316
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
We can take some over there later. So now, I will drop the cards.

317
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And you'll say stop, anywhere. Got it?

318
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Five of clubs.

319
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Not the last. Yes, that's difficult to find a card here.

320
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
(Laughter)

321
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
We do it again.

322
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
The person who said five of clubs say stop,

323
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
when the cards are in the air, right?

324
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
(Audience: Stop.)

325
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
LG: Very good.

326
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
OK.

327
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
(Applause)

328
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000
OK, I had to use a little force there.

329
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
I think we save five of clubs.

330
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And now a card with a contrast of five of clubs.

331
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
(Audience: Queen of hearts.) LG: Queen of hearts, yeah.

332
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Excellent. I love that card.

333
0:16:02.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Here, I will do the most difficult thing.

334
0:16:06.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
For example, you are sitting in Las Vegas,

335
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and you're betting,

336
0:16:10.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and you let the other guys

337
0:16:14.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
peek this card by mistake. Feel, it's just the regular, one card.

338
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And now, when I lift this card,

339
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
it shall be your card. What was your card?

340
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:25,000
(Audience: Queen of hearts.)

341
0:16:25.33,000 --> 0:16:27,000
LG: Queen of? Queen of hearts.

342
0:16:27.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
So that's a tough challenge, right?

343
0:16:32.33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
So here, I grab --

344
0:16:35.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
you know this? Five of clubs ...

345
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and queen of hearts. Yes!

346
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
This is a tough one,

347
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:47,000
because here I must take advantage of --

348
0:16:47.33,000 --> 0:16:5,000
I switch it with the five of clubs.

349
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:53,000
So, now

350
0:16:53.33,000 --> 0:16:55,000
a false count.

351
0:16:55.33,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Which card shall I use? Queen or five?

352
0:16:57.33,000 --> 0:17:,000
Zoe: The queen. LG: Queen, yes.

353
0:17:02.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
So, I use the queen, and here's five of clubs.

354
0:17:06.33,000 --> 0:17:08,000
The false count -- and the number

355
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
one, two, three,

356
0:17:11.33,000 --> 0:17:15,000
four, five, six, seven, eight --

357
0:17:15.33,000 --> 0:17:17,000
you say the same card all the time.

358
0:17:17.33,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Eight, nine, 10.

359
0:17:19.33,000 --> 0:17:22,000
This is a kind of optical deal, right?

360
0:17:23.33,000 --> 0:17:26,000
When I put one card at a table --

361
0:17:26.33,000 --> 0:17:28,000
look, it's not one card. It's -- look,

362
0:17:28.33,000 --> 0:17:31,000
it's a bunch of cards that gives this

363
0:17:31.33,000 --> 0:17:33,000
impression.

364
0:17:33.33,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Yeah.

365
0:17:37.33,000 --> 0:17:4,000
Now some hard stuff.

366
0:17:42.33,000 --> 0:17:45,000
I think we keep the queen here, yes.

367
0:17:45.33,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Now, to the satellites things.

368
0:17:51.33,000 --> 0:17:53,000
This --

369
0:17:54.33,000 --> 0:17:57,000
oh sorry, don't look at the beam. My fault.

370
0:17:57.33,000 --> 0:18:03,000
(Laughter)

371
0:18:04.33,000 --> 0:18:07,000
This is high-frequency laser,

372
0:18:08.33,000 --> 0:18:11,000
and it's enough with a fraction of a second

373
0:18:11.33,000 --> 0:18:13,000
to destroy the retina completely.

374
0:18:13.33,000 --> 0:18:15,000
Right, sorry, my -- I should have mentioned that, yeah.

375
0:18:15.33,000 --> 0:18:17,000
But you can relax,

376
0:18:17.33,000 --> 0:18:19,000
because it takes half an hour before it works,

377
0:18:19.33,000 --> 0:18:21,000
so you have plenty of time to see my whole performance.

378
0:18:21.33,000 --> 0:18:23,000
(Laughter)

379
0:18:24.33,000 --> 0:18:27,000
Now,

380
0:18:27.33,000 --> 0:18:29,000
I put the laser here,

381
0:18:29.33,000 --> 0:18:31,000
and --

382
0:18:31.33,000 --> 0:18:34,000
now, when I deal the cards in the laser,

383
0:18:36.33,000 --> 0:18:38,000
I know where they are but -- yes?

384
0:18:38.33,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Did the camera got it?

385
0:18:40.33,000 --> 0:18:42,000
No?

386
0:18:42.33,000 --> 0:18:44,000
They didn't?

387
0:18:44.33,000 --> 0:18:47,000
What happened?

388
0:18:47.33,000 --> 0:18:49,000
(Audience: It disappeared.)

389
0:18:49.33,000 --> 0:18:52,000
LG: OK, I'll take another group.

390
0:18:52.33,000 --> 0:18:55,000
Do the cameras see the cards now?

391
0:18:56.33,000 --> 0:18:59,000
No? (Audience: No, they're all gone.)

392
0:18:59.33,000 --> 0:19:01,000
LG: But you see the hand.

393
0:19:01.33,000 --> 0:19:03,000
Ah, good, good, good. But now.

394
0:19:03.33,000 --> 0:19:05,000
So now, that was the reason, right?

395
0:19:05.33,000 --> 0:19:08,000
You see the cards? Yes.

396
0:19:08.33,000 --> 0:19:1,000
(Laughter)

397
0:19:10.33,000 --> 0:19:12,000
Yeah, good.

398
0:19:12.33,000 --> 0:19:14,000
Now --

399
0:19:14.33,000 --> 0:19:16,000
(Laughter)

400
0:19:16.33,000 --> 0:19:19,000
-- one guy laughed. So now, to find the queen,

401
0:19:20.33,000 --> 0:19:23,000
do it this way: take back the other one, take back the queen.

402
0:19:23.33,000 --> 0:19:26,000
(Laughter)

403
0:19:26.33,000 --> 0:19:28,000
Yeah, interesting,

404
0:19:28.33,000 --> 0:19:3,000
but a little dangerous.

405
0:19:32.33,000 --> 0:19:38,000
(Laughter)

406
0:19:38.33,000 --> 0:19:4,000
I liked it. Now,

407
0:19:40.33,000 --> 0:19:42,000
a little more difficult.

408
0:19:42.33,000 --> 0:19:45,000
Name -- anyone, name, please, any suit.

409
0:19:47.33,000 --> 0:19:49,000
(Audience: Spades.) LG: Spades? Spades, good.

410
0:19:50.33,000 --> 0:19:52,000
So here,

411
0:19:52.33,000 --> 0:19:55,000
here I have to peek, lots of cards.

412
0:19:55.33,000 --> 0:19:57,000
I think there are lots of --

413
0:19:57.33,000 --> 0:20:,000
I don't know how many -- but 10, 15 spades in a deck, at least, right?

414
0:20:00.33,000 --> 0:20:02,000
(Laughter)

415
0:20:02.33,000 --> 0:20:05,000
So every time I lift the heap, I peek, right.

416
0:20:05.33,000 --> 0:20:07,000
Then I arrange them so I can

417
0:20:07.33,000 --> 0:20:09,000
get them quick.

418
0:20:09.33,000 --> 0:20:12,000
Perfect, excellent.

419
0:20:12.33,000 --> 0:20:15,000
So I start with the ace --

420
0:20:16.33,000 --> 0:20:19,000
yeah, ace. Ah, yeah -- spades?

421
0:20:19.33,000 --> 0:20:22,000
Same mistake as before, right?

422
0:20:22.33,000 --> 0:20:25,000
So -- I arrange the spades -- the clubs.

423
0:20:25.33,000 --> 0:20:29,000
I try to do this right here. First, I take the spades.

424
0:20:29.33,000 --> 0:20:31,000
You see, I don't work with prestige,

425
0:20:31.33,000 --> 0:20:34,000
so always do mistakes.

426
0:20:34.33,000 --> 0:20:36,000
It doesn't matter to me.

427
0:20:36.33,000 --> 0:20:39,000
And now and then, I get some extra sympathy points, right?

428
0:20:40.33,000 --> 0:20:42,000
One,

429
0:20:42.33,000 --> 0:20:45,000
two, three, four -- yes,

430
0:20:45.33,000 --> 0:20:48,000
the camera got it? Five, six,

431
0:20:49.33,000 --> 0:20:51,000
seven, eight --

432
0:20:51.33,000 --> 0:20:53,000
ah --

433
0:20:53.33,000 --> 0:20:55,000
nine, 10,

434
0:20:55.33,000 --> 0:20:57,000
the jack,

435
0:20:57.33,000 --> 0:21:,000
jack of spades,

436
0:21:00.33,000 --> 0:21:02,000
queen of --

437
0:21:02.33,000 --> 0:21:05,000
I like that laugh, yeah! Good. Queen.

438
0:21:05.33,000 --> 0:21:06,000
(Laughter)

439
0:21:06.33,000 --> 0:21:09,000
Wait, wait, wait -- please take any card.

440
0:21:09.33,000 --> 0:21:11,000
Grab any one. Quick, quick, good.

441
0:21:12.33,000 --> 0:21:14,000
And we switch this to the king.

442
0:21:14.33,000 --> 0:21:16,000
Ace of diamonds.

443
0:21:16.33,000 --> 0:21:19,000
And now, look, ace of diamonds will guide.

444
0:21:19.33,000 --> 0:21:21,000
So I find ...

445
0:21:21.33,000 --> 0:21:23,000
king of spades.

446
0:21:23.33,000 --> 0:21:26,000
There was the place. And here is king of spades, correct?

447
0:21:26.33,000 --> 0:21:28,000
Yeah? OK.

448
0:21:28.33,000 --> 0:21:31,000
(Applause)

449
0:21:32.33,000 --> 0:21:34,000
Now, a little more difficult thing.

450
0:21:34.33,000 --> 0:21:36,000
Maybe you think I have the cards in order already,

451
0:21:36.33,000 --> 0:21:38,000
so you help me to shuffle again.

452
0:21:38.33,000 --> 0:21:4,000
Another suit, please.

453
0:21:40.33,000 --> 0:21:42,000
(Audience: Armani.) LG: Pardon? (Audience: Armani.)

454
0:21:42.33,000 --> 0:21:46,000
(Laughter)

455
0:21:46.33,000 --> 0:21:49,000
LG: It was after the blindfold.

456
0:21:51.33,000 --> 0:21:54,000
I like this guy, yeah.

457
0:21:54.33,000 --> 0:21:57,000
OK. That should be my end effect, but OK.

458
0:21:57.33,000 --> 0:21:59,000
Armani -- who said Armani? You?

459
0:21:59.33,000 --> 0:22:03,000
I drop the cards and you -- which size?

460
0:22:03.33,000 --> 0:22:06,000
Which size? It's a piece of cake. I like challenges.

461
0:22:07.33,000 --> 0:22:09,000
Which size?

462
0:22:09.33,000 --> 0:22:11,000
(Audience: Extra large.) LG: Extra large, OK.

463
0:22:11.33,000 --> 0:22:13,000
Say stop. (Audience: Stop.)

464
0:22:13.33,000 --> 0:22:17,000
(Laughter)

465
0:22:17.33,000 --> 0:22:19,000
LG: Yeah, Armani. OK.

466
0:22:19.33,000 --> 0:22:3,000
(Applause)

467
0:22:30.33,000 --> 0:22:33,000
Ah, this is tough.

468
0:22:34.33,000 --> 0:22:37,000
OK, a suit. I had clubs before, spades.

469
0:22:37.33,000 --> 0:22:39,000
Another suit. (Audience: Diamonds.) LG: Diamonds, perfect.

470
0:22:40.33,000 --> 0:22:42,000
So, in this case,

471
0:22:42.33,000 --> 0:22:44,000
I try to

472
0:22:44.33,000 --> 0:22:47,000
locate diamonds. I look at the cards, and OK.

473
0:22:47.33,000 --> 0:22:51,000
We try. Yeah. You help me.

474
0:22:51.33,000 --> 0:22:53,000
If I drop the card face up,

475
0:22:53.33,000 --> 0:22:55,000
like this, you reverse it. Zoe: OK.

476
0:22:55.33,000 --> 0:22:58,000
LG: OK, now.

477
0:22:58.33,000 --> 0:23:01,000
Do with both hands, and quick. Yes, good, good.

478
0:23:01.33,000 --> 0:23:08,000
(Laughter)

479
0:23:09.33,000 --> 0:23:11,000
I think we have it now. Yeah, good, good.

480
0:23:11.33,000 --> 0:23:14,000
So here,

481
0:23:14.33,000 --> 0:23:17,000
diamonds, hearts -- no, diamonds. Good, good.

482
0:23:18.33,000 --> 0:23:21,000
Stop. Do you see the pattern?

483
0:23:21.33,000 --> 0:23:23,000
No? Now?

484
0:23:23.33,000 --> 0:23:25,000
Yes, yes, OK.

485
0:23:25.33,000 --> 0:23:28,000
I work with pattern.

486
0:23:28.33,000 --> 0:23:3,000
Oh sorry, I dropped one.

487
0:23:30.33,000 --> 0:23:31,000
Maybe it's important --

488
0:23:31.33,000 --> 0:23:34,000
yeah --

489
0:23:34.33,000 --> 0:23:36,000
nine of diamonds, OK.

490
0:23:36.33,000 --> 0:23:39,000
So now --

491
0:23:42.33,000 --> 0:23:44,000
I always ask,

492
0:23:44.33,000 --> 0:23:47,000
why do I put myself in this position?

493
0:23:48.33,000 --> 0:23:5,000
I have to figure out so many outs,

494
0:23:50.33,000 --> 0:23:52,000
when I miss some cards, but

495
0:23:52.33,000 --> 0:23:54,000
I love it. So now,

496
0:23:54.33,000 --> 0:23:57,000
I will do it. I will try to find

497
0:23:57.33,000 --> 0:24:,000
the diamonds,

498
0:24:00.33,000 --> 0:24:02,000
but I will do it the hard way.

499
0:24:02.33,000 --> 0:24:05,000
It's too easy to do it right away, right?

500
0:24:06.33,000 --> 0:24:09,000
I think I will do it ...

501
0:24:10.33,000 --> 0:24:13,000
blindfolded.

502
0:24:14.33,000 --> 0:24:16,000
At this distance, it works immediately.

503
0:24:16.33,000 --> 0:24:18,000
Aargh!

504
0:24:18.33,000 --> 0:24:28,000
(Laughter)

505
0:24:28.33,000 --> 0:24:31,000
Duct tape.

506
0:24:31.33,000 --> 0:24:34,000
I look -- shake the cards, so I don't.

507
0:24:36.33,000 --> 0:24:38,000
Go ahead. Yeah, good. I like the empathy.

508
0:24:38.33,000 --> 0:24:4,000
Empathy.

509
0:24:40.33,000 --> 0:24:42,000
But it was -- did you hear?

510
0:24:42.33,000 --> 0:24:45,000
It was women's voice. Hear the guy -- yeah, more, more, more.

511
0:24:45.33,000 --> 0:24:47,000
(Laughter)

512
0:24:47.33,000 --> 0:24:49,000
Yeah, good. Yeah.

513
0:24:49.33,000 --> 0:24:52,000
You can take the nostril too, because some guys think --

514
0:24:52.33,000 --> 0:24:57,000
(Laughter)

515
0:24:58.33,000 --> 0:25:01,000
-- some guys think I can peek through the nostril, so do

516
0:25:04.33,000 --> 0:25:06,000
more. Go, go.

517
0:25:07.33,000 --> 0:25:09,000
Right? Good.

518
0:25:09.33,000 --> 0:25:11,000
Satisfied?

519
0:25:11.33,000 --> 0:25:14,000
Looks good, like Batman. Ow!

520
0:25:14.33,000 --> 0:25:16,000
(Laughter)

521
0:25:17.33,000 --> 0:25:2,000
No, with dignity and elegance, right?

522
0:25:22.33,000 --> 0:25:25,000
But I like her, yeah. I said, be a little tough.

523
0:25:25.33,000 --> 0:25:27,000
And it was OK. One more?

524
0:25:27.33,000 --> 0:25:29,000
The last.

525
0:25:29.33,000 --> 0:25:31,000
OK.

526
0:25:31.33,000 --> 0:25:33,000
All right.

527
0:25:33.33,000 --> 0:25:35,000
Now you must agree that I'm --

528
0:25:35.33,000 --> 0:25:39,000
I must rely on other senses, right?

529
0:25:40.33,000 --> 0:25:43,000
I work with vibration.

530
0:25:47.33,000 --> 0:25:5,000
So,

531
0:25:51.33,000 --> 0:25:53,000
what was the card?

532
0:25:53.33,000 --> 0:25:55,000
Diamonds. Ah, I memorized hearts.

533
0:25:55.33,000 --> 0:25:57,000
So now I have

534
0:25:57.33,000 --> 0:26:,000
to improvise again.

535
0:26:01.33,000 --> 0:26:04,000
Maybe I'll stand up. Half.

536
0:26:04.33,000 --> 0:26:07,000
Diamonds -- I'll start with ace of diamonds.

537
0:26:09.33,000 --> 0:26:11,000
Just kidding, warming up -- king of hearts.

538
0:26:11.33,000 --> 0:26:14,000
(Laughter)

539
0:26:14.33,000 --> 0:26:17,000
And I give you a diamonds, so they -- so you put them here,

540
0:26:17.33,000 --> 0:26:2,000
in a nice row, right. And you can see, yeah? Good.

541
0:26:20.33,000 --> 0:26:22,000
Ace of diamonds, yes? Zoe: Yeah.

542
0:26:22.33,000 --> 0:26:24,000
LG: Good. Good. Two -- (Applause) --

543
0:26:24.33,000 --> 0:26:26,000
thank you.

544
0:26:26.33,000 --> 0:26:29,000
I never ever miss two. This is interesting.

545
0:26:29.33,000 --> 0:26:31,000
Always I've found two,

546
0:26:31.33,000 --> 0:26:33,000
but the wrong color. Spades, sorry.

547
0:26:36.33,000 --> 0:26:38,000
And the deck is a gift to you after,

548
0:26:38.33,000 --> 0:26:41,000
so let the skepticals here, in this,

549
0:26:41.33,000 --> 0:26:44,000
examine them, right? Remind me. It's a gift.

550
0:26:44.33,000 --> 0:26:47,000
Two -- and it was two of spades, right?

551
0:26:48.33,000 --> 0:26:5,000
Sorry, two of diamonds. I'll do it quick now.

552
0:26:50.33,000 --> 0:26:53,000
Three --

553
0:26:53.33,000 --> 0:26:55,000
three of diamonds. Yes!

554
0:26:55.33,000 --> 0:26:57,000
Four --

555
0:26:57.33,000 --> 0:27:,000
I like challenges, yes.

556
0:27:00.33,000 --> 0:27:02,000
Yeah, good.

557
0:27:02.33,000 --> 0:27:03,000
Chris Anderson: You're peeking.

558
0:27:03.33,000 --> 0:27:04,000
LG: Pardon?

559
0:27:04.33,000 --> 0:27:06,000
CA: You're peeking. You just got to --

560
0:27:06.33,000 --> 0:27:08,000
this is a request from the lady in the back.

561
0:27:08.33,000 --> 0:27:2,000
(Laughter)

562
0:27:20.33,000 --> 0:27:23,000
Okay.

563
0:27:27.33,000 --> 0:27:29,000
Try that.

564
0:27:53.33,000 --> 0:27:56,000
LG: Yeah. Also listen.

565
0:28:03.33,000 --> 0:28:06,000
OK, now.

566
0:28:07.33,000 --> 0:28:09,000
This is maybe a little tough.

567
0:28:09.33,000 --> 0:28:11,000
We will try.

568
0:28:12.33,000 --> 0:28:14,000
Yes? Good?

569
0:28:14.33,000 --> 0:28:21,000
(Laughter)

570
0:28:21.33,000 --> 0:28:23,000
OK. So,

571
0:28:24.33,000 --> 0:28:26,000
how many cards? Five? Zoe: Four.

572
0:28:26.33,000 --> 0:28:28,000
LG: Four. Is five the next card?

573
0:28:28.33,000 --> 0:28:3,000
Zoe: Five of diamonds, yeah.

574
0:28:30.33,000 --> 0:28:32,000
LG: It's not here? Zoe: It's not there.

575
0:28:32.33,000 --> 0:28:34,000
LG: Oh.

576
0:28:34.33,000 --> 0:28:36,000
So here,

577
0:28:36.33,000 --> 0:28:38,000
all the cards are face down --

578
0:28:38.33,000 --> 0:28:4,000
you agree? (Audience: Yes.)

579
0:28:40.33,000 --> 0:28:42,000
LG: Yes? You see that in the screen?

580
0:28:42.33,000 --> 0:28:45,000
And this is face up, and it's not at the bottom here.

581
0:28:45.33,000 --> 0:28:47,000
So next card will be -- was it five?

582
0:28:47.33,000 --> 0:28:49,000
Zoe: Five. LG: Yeah --

583
0:28:49.33,000 --> 0:28:51,000
I will reverse it face up here.

584
0:28:52.33,000 --> 0:28:55,000
Yes? Zoe: Yeah.

585
0:28:55.33,000 --> 0:28:58,000
LG: Six -- six with the thumb.

586
0:29:04.33,000 --> 0:29:06,000
Seven.

587
0:29:09.33,000 --> 0:29:11,000
Yeah, I do this. I know where it is,

588
0:29:11.33,000 --> 0:29:14,000
because I peeked before and then I do this.

589
0:29:14.33,000 --> 0:29:16,000
Right?

590
0:29:18.33,000 --> 0:29:2,000
Eight.

591
0:29:23.33,000 --> 0:29:25,000
If --

592
0:29:28.33,000 --> 0:29:31,000
and then nine, right?

593
0:29:31.33,000 --> 0:29:33,000
Yeah.

594
0:29:33.33,000 --> 0:29:35,000
Yesterday -- the day before yesterday, I was in Vegas,

595
0:29:35.33,000 --> 0:29:37,000
and I used this actually.

596
0:29:37.33,000 --> 0:29:4,000
Nine? Yeah? Correct?

597
0:29:40.33,000 --> 0:29:42,000
No? Yes! Ah, good, good.

598
0:29:44.33,000 --> 0:29:47,000
Ten --

599
0:29:47.33,000 --> 0:29:5,000
once again, I love this Jonny Wayne move.

600
0:29:53.33,000 --> 0:29:56,000
Yeah. Jack -- you [unclear] with Jack?

601
0:29:56.33,000 --> 0:29:58,000
Jack

602
0:29:58.33,000 --> 0:30:,000
of

603
0:30:00.33,000 --> 0:30:02,000
diamonds, correct? (Audience: No.)

604
0:30:02.33,000 --> 0:30:04,000
LG: Yes?

605
0:30:05.33,000 --> 0:30:07,000
And

606
0:30:07.33,000 --> 0:30:1,000
queen! Queen, with misdirection.

607
0:30:11.33,000 --> 0:30:13,000
Misdirection. (Applause)

608
0:30:14.33,000 --> 0:30:16,000
Yeah?

609
0:30:19.33,000 --> 0:30:21,000
And then,

610
0:30:21.33,000 --> 0:30:24,000
king, after exactly

611
0:30:24.33,000 --> 0:30:26,000
five seconds.

612
0:30:28.33,000 --> 0:30:31,000
Yeah. Five. Five seconds.

613
0:30:31.33,000 --> 0:30:33,000
One,

614
0:30:33.33,000 --> 0:30:36,000
two, three, four -- mmm!

615
0:30:37.33,000 --> 0:30:39,000
Check it.

616
0:30:39.33,000 --> 0:30:41,000
Yes?

617
0:30:41.33,000 --> 0:30:43,000
CA: King of diamonds. LG: Ah!

618
0:30:43.33,000 --> 0:30:45,000
Good. Oh.

619
0:30:52.33,000 --> 0:30:54,000
Touch me, feel --

620
0:30:54.33,000 --> 0:30:56,000
ah, ah, you know!

621
0:30:56.33,000 --> 0:30:58,000
CA: Ladies and gentlemen, Lennart Green! LG: Okay, thank you.

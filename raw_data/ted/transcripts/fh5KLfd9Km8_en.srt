1
0:00:12.968,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'm thrilled to be talking to you by this high-tech method.

2
0:00:18.167,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Of all humans who have ever lived,

3
0:00:20.103,000 --> 0:00:24,000
the overwhelming majority would have found what we are doing here

4
0:00:24.736,000 --> 0:00:26,000
incomprehensible, unbelievable.

5
0:00:27.76,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Because, for thousands of centuries,

6
0:00:30.777,000 --> 0:00:32,000
in the dark time before the scientific revolution

7
0:00:33.736,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and the Enlightenment,

8
0:00:35.568,000 --> 0:00:37,000
people had low expectations.

9
0:00:38.56,000 --> 0:00:41,000
For their lives, for their descendants' lives.

10
0:00:41.6,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Typically, they expected

11
0:00:43.466,000 --> 0:00:47,000
nothing significantly new or better to be achieved, ever.

12
0:00:48.847,000 --> 0:00:52,000
This pessimism famously appears in the Bible,

13
0:00:53.855,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in one of the few biblical passages with a named author.

14
0:00:58.093,000 --> 0:01:01,000
He's called Qohelet, he's an enigmatic chap.

15
0:01:02.173,000 --> 0:01:06,000
He wrote, "What has been is what will be,

16
0:01:07.133,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and what has been done is what will be done;

17
0:01:10.736,000 --> 0:01:12,000
there is nothing new under the sun.

18
0:01:14.14,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Is there something of which it is said, 'Look, this is new.'

19
0:01:18.379,000 --> 0:01:22,000
No, that thing was already done in the ages that came before us."

20
0:01:23.427,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Qohelet was describing a world without novelty.

21
0:01:29.252,000 --> 0:01:32,000
By novelty I mean something new in Qohelet's sense,

22
0:01:32.554,000 --> 0:01:34,000
not merely something that's changed,

23
0:01:35.196,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but a significant change with lasting effects,

24
0:01:38.72,000 --> 0:01:4,000
where people really would say,

25
0:01:40.919,000 --> 0:01:41,000
"Look, this is new,"

26
0:01:42.919,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and, preferably, "good."

27
0:01:46.061,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So, purely random changes aren't novelty.

28
0:01:50.942,000 --> 0:01:55,000
OK, Heraclitus did say a man can't step in the same river twice,

29
0:01:56.173,000 --> 0:01:58,000
because it's not the same river, he's not the same man.

30
0:01:59.307,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But if the river is changing randomly,

31
0:02:03.423,000 --> 0:02:05,000
it really is the same river.

32
0:02:06.311,000 --> 0:02:07,000
In contrast,

33
0:02:07.788,000 --> 0:02:11,000
if an idea in a mind spreads to other minds,

34
0:02:12.423,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and changes lives for generations,

35
0:02:15.228,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that is novelty.

36
0:02:17.395,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Human life without novelty

37
0:02:20.347,000 --> 0:02:23,000
is life without creativity, without progress.

38
0:02:24.498,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It's a static society, a zero-sum game.

39
0:02:28.712,000 --> 0:02:31,000
That was the living hell in which Qohelet lived.

40
0:02:32.419,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Like everyone, until a few centuries ago.

41
0:02:36.228,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It was hell, because for humans,

42
0:02:40.857,000 --> 0:02:44,000
suffering is intimately related to staticity.

43
0:02:44.982,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Because staticity isn't just frustrating.

44
0:02:48.442,000 --> 0:02:5,000
All sources of suffering --

45
0:02:50.466,000 --> 0:02:54,000
famine, pandemics, incoming asteroids,

46
0:02:54.764,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and things like war and slavery,

47
0:02:58.296,000 --> 0:03:03,000
hurt people only until we have created the knowledge to prevent them.

48
0:03:04.631,000 --> 0:03:08,000
There's a story in Somerset Maugham's novel "Of Human Bondage"

49
0:03:08.958,000 --> 0:03:09,000
about an ancient sage

50
0:03:10.768,000 --> 0:03:15,000
who summarizes the entire history of mankind as,

51
0:03:16.529,000 --> 0:03:17,000
"He was born,

52
0:03:18.097,000 --> 0:03:2,000
he suffered and he died."

53
0:03:21.296,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And it goes on:

54
0:03:23.034,000 --> 0:03:27,000
"Life was insignificant and death without consequence."

55
0:03:28.268,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And indeed, the overwhelming majority of humans who have ever lived

56
0:03:33.197,000 --> 0:03:36,000
had lives of suffering and grueling labor,

57
0:03:37.001,000 --> 0:03:4,000
before dying young and in agony.

58
0:03:41.493,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And yes, in most generations

59
0:03:45.728,000 --> 0:03:49,000
nothing had any novel consequence for subsequent generations.

60
0:03:50.728,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Nevertheless, when ancient people tried to explain their condition,

61
0:03:58.103,000 --> 0:04:02,000
they typically did so in grandiose cosmic terms.

62
0:04:02.794,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Which was the right thing to do, as it turns out.

63
0:04:05.625,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Even though their actual explanations, their myths,

64
0:04:09.444,000 --> 0:04:1,000
were largely false.

65
0:04:11.744,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Some tried to explain

66
0:04:13.831,000 --> 0:04:16,000
the grimness and monotony of their world

67
0:04:17.387,000 --> 0:04:21,000
in terms of an endless cosmic war between good and evil,

68
0:04:22.252,000 --> 0:04:24,000
in which humans were the battleground.

69
0:04:25.637,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Which neatly explained why their own experience was full of suffering,

70
0:04:29.882,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and why progress never happened.

71
0:04:32.728,000 --> 0:04:34,000
But it wasn't true.

72
0:04:36.212,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Amazingly enough,

73
0:04:38.403,000 --> 0:04:4,000
all their conflict and suffering

74
0:04:41.149,000 --> 0:04:46,000
were just due to the way they processed ideas.

75
0:04:47.125,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Being satisfied with dogma, and just-so stories,

76
0:04:51.391,000 --> 0:04:53,000
rather than criticizing them

77
0:04:53.859,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and trying to guess better explanations of the world and of their own condition.

78
0:05:00.696,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Twentieth-century physics did create better explanations,

79
0:05:05.363,000 --> 0:05:07,000
but still in terms of a cosmic war.

80
0:05:07.57,000 --> 0:05:12,000
This time, the combatants were order and chaos, or entropy.

81
0:05:12.887,000 --> 0:05:17,000
That story does allow for hope for the future.

82
0:05:18.986,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But in another way,

83
0:05:20.201,000 --> 0:05:22,000
it's even bleaker than the ancient myths,

84
0:05:23.017,000 --> 0:05:26,000
because the villain, entropy,

85
0:05:26.815,000 --> 0:05:29,000
is preordained to have the final victory,

86
0:05:30.442,000 --> 0:05:34,000
when the inexorable laws of thermodynamics shut down all novelty

87
0:05:35.347,000 --> 0:05:38,000
with the so-called heat death of the universe.

88
0:05:38.982,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Currently, there's a story of a local battle in that war,

89
0:05:43.149,000 --> 0:05:46,000
between sustainability, which is order,

90
0:05:47.117,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and wastefulness, which is chaos --

91
0:05:50.498,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that's the contemporary take on good and evil,

92
0:05:53.585,000 --> 0:05:56,000
often with the added twist that humans are the evil,

93
0:05:56.919,000 --> 0:05:58,000
so we shouldn't even try to win.

94
0:05:59.585,000 --> 0:06:,000
And recently,

95
0:06:00.8,000 --> 0:06:02,000
there have been tales of another cosmic war,

96
0:06:02.872,000 --> 0:06:06,000
between gravity, which collapses the universe,

97
0:06:07.077,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and dark energy, which finally shreds it.

98
0:06:10.514,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So this time,

99
0:06:11.744,000 --> 0:06:14,000
whichever of those cosmic forces wins,

100
0:06:15.18,000 --> 0:06:16,000
we lose.

101
0:06:17.157,000 --> 0:06:21,000
All those pessimistic accounts of the human condition

102
0:06:22.161,000 --> 0:06:24,000
contain some truth,

103
0:06:24.494,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but as prophecies,

104
0:06:26.446,000 --> 0:06:29,000
they're all misleading, and all for the same reason.

105
0:06:29.962,000 --> 0:06:33,000
None of them portrays humans as what we really are.

106
0:06:34.688,000 --> 0:06:36,000
As Jacob Bronowski said,

107
0:06:37.124,000 --> 0:06:4,000
"Man is not a figure in the landscape --

108
0:06:41.069,000 --> 0:06:43,000
he is the shaper of the landscape."

109
0:06:43.871,000 --> 0:06:44,000
In other words,

110
0:06:45.046,000 --> 0:06:49,000
humans are not playthings of cosmic forces,

111
0:06:49.522,000 --> 0:06:52,000
we are users of cosmic forces.

112
0:06:53.093,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I'll say more about that in a moment,

113
0:06:54.887,000 --> 0:06:58,000
but first, what sorts of thing create novelty?

114
0:07:00.022,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Well, the beginning of the universe surely did.

115
0:07:03.196,000 --> 0:07:06,000
The big bang, nearly 14 billion years ago,

116
0:07:06.292,000 --> 0:07:09,000
created space, time and energy,

117
0:07:09.704,000 --> 0:07:1,000
everything physical.

118
0:07:11.609,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And then, immediately,

119
0:07:13.736,000 --> 0:07:16,000
what I call the first era of novelty,

120
0:07:17.331,000 --> 0:07:19,000
with the first atom, the first star,

121
0:07:20.159,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the first black hole,

122
0:07:21.699,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the first galaxy.

123
0:07:23.833,000 --> 0:07:26,000
But then, at some point,

124
0:07:27.024,000 --> 0:07:3,000
novelty vanished from the universe.

125
0:07:30.307,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Perhaps from as early as 12 or 13 billion years ago,

126
0:07:34.466,000 --> 0:07:36,000
right up to the present day,

127
0:07:36.53,000 --> 0:07:41,000
there's never been any new kind of astronomical object.

128
0:07:41.609,000 --> 0:07:45,000
There's only been what I call the great monotony.

129
0:07:46.807,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So, Qohelet was accidentally even more right

130
0:07:51.569,000 --> 0:07:53,000
about the universe beyond the Sun

131
0:07:54.434,000 --> 0:07:56,000
than he was about under the Sun.

132
0:07:57.156,000 --> 0:08:,000
So long as the great monotony lasts,

133
0:08:00.851,000 --> 0:08:02,000
what has been out there

134
0:08:03.438,000 --> 0:08:04,000
really is what will be.

135
0:08:05.43,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And there is nothing out there

136
0:08:07.006,000 --> 0:08:11,000
of which it can truly be said, "Look, this is new."

137
0:08:11.646,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Nevertheless,

138
0:08:13.661,000 --> 0:08:17,000
at some point during the great monotony,

139
0:08:17.852,000 --> 0:08:2,000
there was an event -- inconsequential at the time,

140
0:08:21.561,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and even billions of years later,

141
0:08:23.784,000 --> 0:08:26,000
it had affected nothing beyond its home planet --

142
0:08:27.196,000 --> 0:08:32,000
yet eventually, it could cause cosmically momentous novelty.

143
0:08:33.277,000 --> 0:08:36,000
That event was the origin of life:

144
0:08:37.102,000 --> 0:08:4,000
creating the first genetic knowledge,

145
0:08:40.228,000 --> 0:08:42,000
coding for biological adaptations,

146
0:08:43.109,000 --> 0:08:45,000
coding for novelty.

147
0:08:46.243,000 --> 0:08:49,000
On Earth, it utterly transformed the surface.

148
0:08:50.091,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Genes in the DNA of single-celled organisms

149
0:08:53.519,000 --> 0:08:54,000
put oxygen in the air,

150
0:08:55.441,000 --> 0:08:56,000
extracted CO2,

151
0:08:57.323,000 --> 0:08:59,000
put chalk and iron ore into the ground,

152
0:09:00.323,000 --> 0:09:06,000
hardly a cubic inch of the surface to some depth has remained unaffected

153
0:09:06.371,000 --> 0:09:07,000
by those genes.

154
0:09:08.942,000 --> 0:09:13,000
The Earth became, if not a novel place on the cosmic scale,

155
0:09:14.371,000 --> 0:09:15,000
certainly a weird one.

156
0:09:16.236,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Just as an example, beyond Earth,

157
0:09:19.482,000 --> 0:09:23,000
only a few hundred different chemical substances have been detected.

158
0:09:24.411,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Presumably, there are some more in lifeless locations,

159
0:09:27.89,000 --> 0:09:28,000
but on Earth,

160
0:09:29.763,000 --> 0:09:32,000
evolution created billions of different chemicals.

161
0:09:33.843,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And then the first plants, animals,

162
0:09:36.929,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and then, in some ancestor species of ours,

163
0:09:41.762,000 --> 0:09:42,000
explanatory knowledge.

164
0:09:43.936,000 --> 0:09:46,000
For the first time in the universe, for all we know.

165
0:09:47.413,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Explanatory knowledge is the defining adaptation of our species.

166
0:09:53.149,000 --> 0:09:56,000
It differs from the nonexplanatory knowledge

167
0:09:56.268,000 --> 0:09:58,000
in DNA, for instance,

168
0:09:58.53,000 --> 0:09:59,000
by being universal.

169
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
That is to say, whatever can be understood,

170
0:10:04.378,000 --> 0:10:06,000
can be understood through explanatory knowledge.

171
0:10:07.068,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And more, any physical process

172
0:10:10.895,000 --> 0:10:12,000
can be controlled by such knowledge,

173
0:10:13.8,000 --> 0:10:15,000
limited only by the laws of physics.

174
0:10:17.228,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And so, explanatory knowledge, too,

175
0:10:21.023,000 --> 0:10:23,000
has begun to transform the Earth's surface.

176
0:10:24.792,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And soon, the Earth will become the only known object in the universe

177
0:10:30.141,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that turns aside incoming asteroids instead of attracting them.

178
0:10:36.3,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Qohelet was understandably misled

179
0:10:39.737,000 --> 0:10:42,000
by the painful slowness of progress in his day.

180
0:10:44.109,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Novelty in human life was still too rare, too gradual,

181
0:10:48.419,000 --> 0:10:5,000
to be noticed in one generation.

182
0:10:51.149,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And in the biosphere,

183
0:10:53.117,000 --> 0:10:56,000
the evolution of novel species was even slower.

184
0:10:57.14,000 --> 0:10:59,000
But both things were happening.

185
0:11:00.029,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Now, why is there a great monotony in the universe at large,

186
0:11:06.482,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and what makes our planet buck that trend?

187
0:11:10.902,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Well, the universe at large is relatively simple.

188
0:11:16.37,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Stars are so simple

189
0:11:18.427,000 --> 0:11:21,000
that we can predict their behavior billions of years into the future,

190
0:11:21.847,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and retrodict how they formed billions of years ago.

191
0:11:26.061,000 --> 0:11:28,000
So why is the universe simple?

192
0:11:28.759,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Basically, it's because big, massive, powerful things

193
0:11:34.559,000 --> 0:11:38,000
strongly affect lesser things, and not vice versa.

194
0:11:39.617,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I call that the hierarchy rule.

195
0:11:42.006,000 --> 0:11:45,000
For example, when a comet hits the Sun,

196
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
the Sun carries on just as before,

197
0:11:47.752,000 --> 0:11:49,000
but the comet is vaporized.

198
0:11:50.657,000 --> 0:11:51,000
For the same reason,

199
0:11:52.538,000 --> 0:11:58,000
big things are not much affected by small parts of themselves,

200
0:11:59.133,000 --> 0:12:,000
i.e., by details.

201
0:12:01.609,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Which means that their overall behavior

202
0:12:04.696,000 --> 0:12:05,000
is simple.

203
0:12:06.165,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And since nothing very new can happen to things

204
0:12:09.585,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that remain simple,

205
0:12:11.347,000 --> 0:12:16,000
the hierarchy rule, by causing large-scale simplicity,

206
0:12:16.676,000 --> 0:12:18,000
has caused the great monotony.

207
0:12:20.473,000 --> 0:12:23,000
But, the saving grace is

208
0:12:23.934,000 --> 0:12:26,000
the hierarchy rule is not a law of nature.

209
0:12:27.918,000 --> 0:12:29,000
It just happens to have held so far in the universe,

210
0:12:30.855,000 --> 0:12:31,000
except here.

211
0:12:32.141,000 --> 0:12:36,000
In our biosphere, molecule-sized objects, genes,

212
0:12:37.117,000 --> 0:12:4,000
control vastly disproportionate resources.

213
0:12:40.615,000 --> 0:12:42,000
The first genes for photosynthesis,

214
0:12:43.535,000 --> 0:12:45,000
by causing their own proliferation,

215
0:12:46.306,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and then transforming the surface of the planet,

216
0:12:49.845,000 --> 0:12:53,000
have violated or reversed the hierarchy rule

217
0:12:54.327,000 --> 0:12:58,000
by the mind-blowing factor of 10 to the power 40.

218
0:12:59.39,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Explanatory knowledge is potentially far more powerful

219
0:13:03.696,000 --> 0:13:04,000
because of universality,

220
0:13:05.355,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and more rapidly created.

221
0:13:08.157,000 --> 0:13:12,000
When human knowledge has achieved a factor 10 to the 40,

222
0:13:12.905,000 --> 0:13:14,000
it will pretty much control the entire galaxy,

223
0:13:15.889,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and will be looking beyond.

224
0:13:17.841,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So humans,

225
0:13:20.292,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and any other explanation creators who may exist out there,

226
0:13:24.982,000 --> 0:13:28,000
are the ultimate agents of novelty for the universe.

227
0:13:30.343,000 --> 0:13:32,000
We are the reason and the means

228
0:13:33.026,000 --> 0:13:38,000
by which novelty and creativity, knowledge, progress,

229
0:13:39.03,000 --> 0:13:44,000
can have objective, large-scale physical effects.

230
0:13:45.514,000 --> 0:13:47,000
From the human perspective,

231
0:13:48.387,000 --> 0:13:52,000
the only alternative to that living hell of static societies

232
0:13:52.617,000 --> 0:13:56,000
is continual creation of new ideas,

233
0:13:57.228,000 --> 0:14:,000
behaviors, new kinds of objects.

234
0:14:00.728,000 --> 0:14:02,000
This robot will soon be obsolete,

235
0:14:02.886,000 --> 0:14:06,000
because of new explanatory knowledge, progress.

236
0:14:08.204,000 --> 0:14:11,000
But from the cosmic perspective,

237
0:14:11.434,000 --> 0:14:15,000
explanatory knowledge is the nemesis of the hierarchy rule.

238
0:14:16.752,000 --> 0:14:18,000
It's the destroyer of the great monotony.

239
0:14:20.379,000 --> 0:14:25,000
So it's the creator of the next cosmological era,

240
0:14:25.569,000 --> 0:14:26,000
the Anthropocene.

241
0:14:27.966,000 --> 0:14:3,000
If one can speak of a cosmic war,

242
0:14:31.363,000 --> 0:14:34,000
it's not the one portrayed in those pessimistic stories.

243
0:14:34.792,000 --> 0:14:38,000
It's a war between monotony and novelty,

244
0:14:39.53,000 --> 0:14:42,000
between stasis and creativity.

245
0:14:43.633,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And in this war,

246
0:14:45.688,000 --> 0:14:49,000
our side is not destined to lose.

247
0:14:50.593,000 --> 0:14:56,000
If we choose to apply our unique capacity to create explanatory knowledge,

248
0:14:57.419,000 --> 0:14:58,000
we could win.

249
0:15:00.175,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Thanks.

250
0:15:02.095,000 --> 0:15:08,000

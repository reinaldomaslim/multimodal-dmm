1
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Almost 30 years ago,

2
0:00:14.833,000 --> 0:00:17,000
my country was facing the need to rebuild everything from scratch.

3
0:00:19.333,000 --> 0:00:21,000
After years of Soviet occupation,

4
0:00:21.542,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Estonia regained its independence, but we were left with nothing.

5
0:00:25.792,000 --> 0:00:29,000
No infrastructure, no administration, no legal code.

6
0:00:30.25,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Organizational chaos.

7
0:00:32.708,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Out of necessity,

8
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:37,000
the state leaders back then had to make some daring choices.

9
0:00:37.458,000 --> 0:00:39,000
The ones that our country could afford.

10
0:00:40.042,000 --> 0:00:42,000
There was a lot of experimentation and uncertainty

11
0:00:42.958,000 --> 0:00:43,000
but also a bit of luck involved,

12
0:00:44.792,000 --> 0:00:46,000
particularly in the fact that we could count on a number

13
0:00:47.458,000 --> 0:00:48,000
of brilliant visionaries,

14
0:00:49.042,000 --> 0:00:52,000
cryptographers and engineers.

15
0:00:52.208,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I was just a kid back then.

16
0:00:54.5,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Today, we are called the most digital society on earth.

17
0:01:00.167,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I'm from Estonia,

18
0:01:01.458,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and we've been declaring taxes online since 2001.

19
0:01:05.583,000 --> 0:01:09,000
We have been using digital identity and signature since 2002.

20
0:01:10.333,000 --> 0:01:13,000
We've been voting online since 2005.

21
0:01:13.708,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And for today, pretty much the whole range of the public services

22
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that you can imagine:

23
0:01:18.542,000 --> 0:01:22,000
education, police, justice, starting a company,

24
0:01:23.083,000 --> 0:01:25,000
applying for benefits, looking at your health record

25
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
or challenging a parking ticket --

26
0:01:28.083,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that's everything that is done online.

27
0:01:31.167,000 --> 0:01:33,000
In fact, it's much easier to tell you

28
0:01:33.958,000 --> 0:01:36,000
what are the three things we cannot yet do online.

29
0:01:37.375,000 --> 0:01:4,000
We have to show up to pick up our ID documents,

30
0:01:40.792,000 --> 0:01:42,000
get married or divorced,

31
0:01:42.875,000 --> 0:01:43,000
or sell real estate.

32
0:01:44.708,000 --> 0:01:45,000
That's pretty much it.

33
0:01:48.208,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So, that's why don't freak out

34
0:01:51.833,000 --> 0:01:53,000
when I tell you that every year

35
0:01:53.958,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I can't wait to start doing my tax declaration.

36
0:01:57.875,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

37
0:01:58.917,000 --> 0:02:,000
Because all I have to do

38
0:02:00.958,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is sit on my couch with a mobile phone,

39
0:02:03.083,000 --> 0:02:07,000
swipe a few pages with prefilled data on income and deductions

40
0:02:07.125,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and hit submit.

41
0:02:08.833,000 --> 0:02:09,000
After three minutes,

42
0:02:10.417,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I'm looking at the tax return amount.

43
0:02:13.083,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It actually feels like a quite rewarding experience.

44
0:02:17.417,000 --> 0:02:19,000
No tax advisors,

45
0:02:19.458,000 --> 0:02:21,000
no collecting receipts,

46
0:02:21.75,000 --> 0:02:22,000
no doing the math.

47
0:02:24.625,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And have I mentioned that I have not visited a state office

48
0:02:27.417,000 --> 0:02:28,000
for almost seven years?

49
0:02:30.667,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Indeed, one of the features of the modern life

50
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that has no reason to exist anymore,

51
0:02:36.208,000 --> 0:02:38,000
considering technological possibilities of today,

52
0:02:39.042,000 --> 0:02:41,000
is the labyrinth of bureaucracy.

53
0:02:41.708,000 --> 0:02:43,000
We've almost got rid of it completely in Estonia,

54
0:02:44.375,000 --> 0:02:48,000
in an effort coordinated by the government that has also digitized itself.

55
0:02:48.542,000 --> 0:02:52,000
For instance, cabinet of ministers' work in e-Cabinet is absolutely paperless.

56
0:02:55.375,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The central idea behind this development

57
0:02:58.5,000 --> 0:03:,000
is transformation of the state role

58
0:03:01.208,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and digitalization of trust.

59
0:03:04.833,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Think about it.

60
0:03:06.125,000 --> 0:03:09,000
In most countries, people don't trust their governments.

61
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And the governments don't trust them back.

62
0:03:13.083,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And all the complicated paper-based formal procedures

63
0:03:16.375,000 --> 0:03:18,000
are supposed to solve that problem.

64
0:03:18.875,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Except that they don't.

65
0:03:21.167,000 --> 0:03:24,000
They just make life more complicated.

66
0:03:24.417,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I believe Estonian experience is showing that technology can be the remedy

67
0:03:29.125,000 --> 0:03:3,000
for getting the trust back,

68
0:03:30.958,000 --> 0:03:31,000
while creating an efficient,

69
0:03:32.958,000 --> 0:03:36,000
user-centric service delivery system

70
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that actively responds to citizens' needs.

71
0:03:41.833,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We did not do it by digitizing bureaucracy as it is.

72
0:03:45.792,000 --> 0:03:49,000
But by rather agreeing on a few strong, common principles,

73
0:03:50.208,000 --> 0:03:52,000
redesigning rules and procedures,

74
0:03:52.708,000 --> 0:03:54,000
getting rid of unnecessary data collection

75
0:03:55.333,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and task duplication,

76
0:03:57.292,000 --> 0:04:,000
and becoming open and transparent.

77
0:04:00.875,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Let me give you a glimpse

78
0:04:02.292,000 --> 0:04:05,000
into some of the key e-Estonia design principles today.

79
0:04:08.042,000 --> 0:04:12,000
First, it is essential to guarantee privacy and confidentiality

80
0:04:12.917,000 --> 0:04:14,000
of data and information.

81
0:04:15.083,000 --> 0:04:18,000
This is achieved through a strong digital identity

82
0:04:18.667,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that is issued by the state

83
0:04:20.542,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and compatible with everything.

84
0:04:22.583,000 --> 0:04:24,000
In fact, every Estonian has one.

85
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
The identity is doubled with a strong digital signature

86
0:04:30.583,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that is accepted, used and legally binding

87
0:04:34.792,000 --> 0:04:36,000
both in Estonia and the European Union.

88
0:04:38.708,000 --> 0:04:43,000
When the system can properly and securely identify who is using it,

89
0:04:44.125,000 --> 0:04:48,000
after logging in, it will provide access to the personal data of the citizen

90
0:04:49.042,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and all the public services within one tool,

91
0:04:52.833,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and allow to authorize anything by signing digitally.

92
0:04:58.583,000 --> 0:05:01,000
A second principle, and one of the most transformative,

93
0:05:02.25,000 --> 0:05:05,000
is called "Once only."

94
0:05:05.292,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It means that the state cannot ask for the same data

95
0:05:09.208,000 --> 0:05:1,000
more than once,

96
0:05:11.083,000 --> 0:05:14,000
nor can store it in more than one place.

97
0:05:14.917,000 --> 0:05:15,000
For instance,

98
0:05:16.208,000 --> 0:05:18,000
if you've already provided your birth or marital certificate

99
0:05:19.167,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to the population registry,

100
0:05:21.125,000 --> 0:05:23,000
this is the only place where this data is going to be held.

101
0:05:24.083,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And no other institution will be ever asking for it again.

102
0:05:29.583,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Once only is a very powerful rule,

103
0:05:32.708,000 --> 0:05:36,000
as it defines the whole structure of the data collection in a country,

104
0:05:36.792,000 --> 0:05:37,000
what information is collected

105
0:05:38.5,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and who is responsible for maintaining it,

106
0:05:41.292,000 --> 0:05:44,000
making sure we avoid centralization of data,

107
0:05:44.417,000 --> 0:05:45,000
duplication of data,

108
0:05:46.208,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and guarantee that it's actually up to date.

109
0:05:50.792,000 --> 0:05:53,000
This distributed approach also avoids the problem

110
0:05:54.292,000 --> 0:05:56,000
of the single point of failure.

111
0:05:57.083,000 --> 0:06:,000
But since the data cannot be replicated,

112
0:06:00.25,000 --> 0:06:02,000
or collected more than once,

113
0:06:02.375,000 --> 0:06:04,000
it means that the design has to keep in mind

114
0:06:05.333,000 --> 0:06:08,000
secure and robust access to that information at all times,

115
0:06:08.875,000 --> 0:06:11,000
so the public institution can offer a service.

116
0:06:13.208,000 --> 0:06:17,000
This is exactly the role of the data exchange platform

117
0:06:17.583,000 --> 0:06:19,000
called the X-Road

118
0:06:19.792,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that has been in use since 2001.

119
0:06:23.708,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Just like a highway,

120
0:06:25.375,000 --> 0:06:28,000
it connects public sector databases and registries,

121
0:06:29.042,000 --> 0:06:31,000
local municipalities and businesses,

122
0:06:31.875,000 --> 0:06:36,000
organizing a real-time, secure and regulated data exchange,

123
0:06:37.333,000 --> 0:06:41,000
saving an auditable trace after each move.

124
0:06:43.5,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Here's a screenshot of a live feed

125
0:06:46.167,000 --> 0:06:48,000
showing all the requests performed on the X-Road

126
0:06:49.083,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and all the services that it actually facilitates.

127
0:06:53.542,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And this is the real picture

128
0:06:56.375,000 --> 0:07:,000
of all the connections between public and private sector databases.

129
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:02,000
As you can see,

130
0:07:02.292,000 --> 0:07:04,000
there is no central database whatsoever.

131
0:07:05.833,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Confidentiality and privacy are definitely very important.

132
0:07:09.583,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But in the digital world,

133
0:07:11.5,000 --> 0:07:13,000
reliability and integrity of information

134
0:07:14.5,000 --> 0:07:16,000
is just critical for operations.

135
0:07:17.458,000 --> 0:07:18,000
For instance,

136
0:07:18.75,000 --> 0:07:2,000
if someone changes your medical health record,

137
0:07:21.083,000 --> 0:07:23,000
let's say allergies,

138
0:07:23.125,000 --> 0:07:25,000
without you or your doctor knowing,

139
0:07:25.708,000 --> 0:07:27,000
treatment could be deadly.

140
0:07:28.625,000 --> 0:07:31,000
That's why in a digital society, a system like an Estonian one,

141
0:07:32.542,000 --> 0:07:34,000
when there's almost no paper originals,

142
0:07:35.333,000 --> 0:07:38,000
there's almost only digital originals,

143
0:07:38.958,000 --> 0:07:4,000
integrity of data,

144
0:07:41.083,000 --> 0:07:43,000
data exchange rules, software components

145
0:07:43.958,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and log files is paramount.

146
0:07:47.583,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We use a form of blockchain that we invented back in 2007,

147
0:07:52.792,000 --> 0:07:55,000
way before blockchain even became a thing,

148
0:07:56.167,000 --> 0:08:,000
to check and guarantee the integrity of data in real time.

149
0:08:01.417,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Blockchain is our auditor

150
0:08:03.792,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and a promise that no access to the data

151
0:08:07.125,000 --> 0:08:1,000
or data manipulation remains unrecorded.

152
0:08:14.083,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Data ownership is another key principle in the design of the system.

153
0:08:19.625,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Aren't you worried by the fact that governments, tech companies

154
0:08:24.083,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and other businesses around the world

155
0:08:26.042,000 --> 0:08:29,000
claim data they've collected about you is theirs,

156
0:08:29.458,000 --> 0:08:33,000
generally refuse to give access to that information,

157
0:08:33.625,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and often fail to prove how it was used

158
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:39,000
or shared with third parties?

159
0:08:40.333,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I don't know, for me it seems like a quite disturbing situation.

160
0:08:46.083,000 --> 0:08:49,000
The Estonian system is based on the principle

161
0:08:49.708,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that an individual is the owner of the data collected about him,

162
0:08:54.25,000 --> 0:08:59,000
thus has an absolute right to know what information is collected

163
0:08:59.333,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and who has been accessing it.

164
0:09:02.208,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Every time a policeman, a doctor or any state officer

165
0:09:06.333,000 --> 0:09:09,000
is accessing personal information of the citizens online,

166
0:09:09.917,000 --> 0:09:13,000
first they only get to access it after logging in

167
0:09:14.333,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to the information they're authorized to see to do their job.

168
0:09:17.792,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And secondly, every time they're making requests,

169
0:09:21.833,000 --> 0:09:23,000
this is saved in a log file.

170
0:09:26.667,000 --> 0:09:3,000
This detailed log file is part of the state public services

171
0:09:31.042,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and allows real transparency,

172
0:09:33.292,000 --> 0:09:38,000
making sure no privacy violation will remain unnoticed to the citizen.

173
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Now, of course, this is only a simplified summary

174
0:09:43.708,000 --> 0:09:47,000
of all the design principles that e-Estonia is built on.

175
0:09:49.917,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And now, government is building up

176
0:09:53.458,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to get ready for use of artificial intelligence

177
0:09:57.5,000 --> 0:10:,000
and building a whole new generation of public services --

178
0:10:01.25,000 --> 0:10:02,000
proactive services

179
0:10:02.875,000 --> 0:10:03,000
that would activate seamlessly

180
0:10:04.708,000 --> 0:10:07,000
based on different life situations that people might be in,

181
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:12,000
such as childbirth, unemployment or starting a business.

182
0:10:15.25,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Now, of course,

183
0:10:16.542,000 --> 0:10:19,000
running a digital society with no paper backup

184
0:10:19.875,000 --> 0:10:2,000
can be an issue, right?

185
0:10:22.417,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Even though we trust our systems to be solid,

186
0:10:25.458,000 --> 0:10:3,000
but one can never be too cautious as we experienced back in 2007,

187
0:10:30.792,000 --> 0:10:33,000
when the first cyberincident happened,

188
0:10:34.583,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and it literally blocked part of our networks,

189
0:10:37.333,000 --> 0:10:4,000
making access to the services impossible for hours.

190
0:10:41.583,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We survived.

191
0:10:43.25,000 --> 0:10:48,000
But this event put cybersecurity at the very top of agenda,

192
0:10:48.5,000 --> 0:10:52,000
both in terms of strengthening the platform and backing it up.

193
0:10:53.958,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So how do you back up a country-wide system in a small state

194
0:10:58.542,000 --> 0:11:,000
where everything is super close?

195
0:11:01.5,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Well for instance, you can export a copy of the data

196
0:11:05.792,000 --> 0:11:07,000
outside the country territory

197
0:11:07.917,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to an extraterritorial space of an embassy.

198
0:11:12.542,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Today, we have those data embassies

199
0:11:15.875,000 --> 0:11:19,000
that are holding the most critical digital assets of Estonia,

200
0:11:20.333,000 --> 0:11:23,000
guaranteeing continuity of operations,

201
0:11:23.417,000 --> 0:11:24,000
protection of our data,

202
0:11:24.958,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and most importantly, our sovereignty.

203
0:11:28.25,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Even in case of a physical attack on our territory.

204
0:11:34.042,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Some of you might be thinking by now:

205
0:11:36.042,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Where are the downsides?

206
0:11:39.083,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Well, going all digital

207
0:11:41.583,000 --> 0:11:46,000
is administratively, and let's be honest, financially more efficient.

208
0:11:46.875,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Interfacing primarily with computer systems

209
0:11:49.542,000 --> 0:11:51,000
might create an impression that the human factor,

210
0:11:52.375,000 --> 0:11:53,000
elected politicians

211
0:11:54.208,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and participating in democratic processes

212
0:11:56.185,000 --> 0:11:58,000
is somehow less important.

213
0:11:59.042,000 --> 0:12:,000
And there are also some people

214
0:12:00.917,000 --> 0:12:02,000
who feel threatened by pervasive technology

215
0:12:03.458,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that might make their skills obsolete.

216
0:12:07.708,000 --> 0:12:09,000
So all in all, unfortunately,

217
0:12:10.083,000 --> 0:12:11,000
running a country on a digital platform

218
0:12:12.042,000 --> 0:12:15,000
has not saved us from political power struggles

219
0:12:15.792,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and polarization in the society,

220
0:12:18.417,000 --> 0:12:2,000
as we have seen in the last elections.

221
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Well, until there are humans involved.

222
0:12:25.917,000 --> 0:12:27,000
One last question.

223
0:12:28.667,000 --> 0:12:3,000
If everything is location-independent

224
0:12:31.083,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and I can access all of the services from anywhere in the world,

225
0:12:34.75,000 --> 0:12:37,000
why cannot others tap into some of these services,

226
0:12:37.833,000 --> 0:12:39,000
even if they don't reside within Estonian borders?

227
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Five years ago,

228
0:12:43.5,000 --> 0:12:47,000
we launched a governmental start-up called e-Residency program

229
0:12:47.875,000 --> 0:12:51,000
that for today joins tens of thousands of people.

230
0:12:52.417,000 --> 0:12:57,000
These are businessmen and women from 136 different countries,

231
0:12:57.75,000 --> 0:13:,000
who establish their businesses digitally,

232
0:13:00.875,000 --> 0:13:02,000
who do their banking online,

233
0:13:03.5,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and who run their companies virtually over e-Estonia platform,

234
0:13:09.417,000 --> 0:13:12,000
within European Union legal framework,

235
0:13:13.125,000 --> 0:13:16,000
using an e-identity card similar to mine

236
0:13:16.875,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and all of that from anywhere in the world.

237
0:13:21.625,000 --> 0:13:24,000
The Estonian system is location-independent

238
0:13:25.167,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and user-centric.

239
0:13:26.875,000 --> 0:13:31,000
It prioritizes inclusiveness, openness and reliability.

240
0:13:32.042,000 --> 0:13:36,000
It puts security and transparency at its center.

241
0:13:36.292,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And the data into the hands of the rightful owner,

242
0:13:40.208,000 --> 0:13:42,000
the person they refer to.

243
0:13:42.708,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Don't take my word for it.

244
0:13:44.708,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Try it.

245
0:13:46.333,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Thank you.

246
0:13:47.708,000 --> 0:13:51,000
(Applause)

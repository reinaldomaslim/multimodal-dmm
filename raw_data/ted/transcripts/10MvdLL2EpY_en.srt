[On April 3, 2016 we saw the largest data leak in history.]

[What does this mean?]

0:00:27.312,000 --> 0:00:29,000
[We called Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain.]

6
0:00:32.852,000 --> 0:00:36,000
This week, there have been a whole slew and deluge of stories

7
0:00:37.828,000 --> 0:00:4,000
coming out from the leak of 11 million documents

8
0:00:41.148,000 --> 0:00:45,000
from a Panamanian-based law firm called Mossack Fonseca.

9
0:00:45.596,000 --> 0:00:5,000
The release of these papers from Panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece

10
0:00:51.402,000 --> 0:00:53,000
of the secretive offshore world.

11
0:00:53.664,000 --> 0:00:58,000
We get an insight into how clients and banks and lawyers

12
0:00:58.996,000 --> 0:01:,000
go to companies like Mossack Fonseca

13
0:01:01.048,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and say, "OK, we want an anonymous company,

14
0:01:03.579,000 --> 0:01:04,000
can you give us one?"

15
0:01:04.995,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So you actually get to see the emails,

16
0:01:06.829,000 --> 0:01:07,000
you get to see the exchanges of messages,

17
0:01:08.816,000 --> 0:01:11,000
you get to see the mechanics of how this works,

18
0:01:11.915,000 --> 0:01:12,000
how this operates.

19
0:01:13.34,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Now, this has already started to have pretty immediate repercussions.

20
0:01:17.417,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned.

21
0:01:20.042,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We've also had news

22
0:01:21.281,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad

23
0:01:26.348,000 --> 0:01:28,000
has also got offshore companies.

24
0:01:28.927,000 --> 0:01:33,000
There's been allegations of a $2 billion money trail

25
0:01:34.18,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that leads back to President Vladimir Putin of Russia

26
0:01:38.107,000 --> 0:01:4,000
via his close childhood friend,

27
0:01:40.592,000 --> 0:01:42,000
who happens to be a top cellist.

28
0:01:42.844,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And there will be a lot of rich individuals out there

29
0:01:45.468,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and others who will be nervous about the next set of stories

30
0:01:49.81,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and the next set of leaked documents.

31
0:01:52.387,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Now, this sounds like the plot of a spy thriller

32
0:01:56.597,000 --> 0:01:57,000
or a John Grisham novel.

33
0:01:58.284,000 --> 0:02:02,000
It seems very distant from you, me, ordinary people.

34
0:02:02.324,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Why should we care about this?

35
0:02:04.856,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals

36
0:02:09.123,000 --> 0:02:11,000
are able to keep their money offshore

37
0:02:11.801,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and not pay the taxes that they should,

38
0:02:14.312,000 --> 0:02:18,000
it means that there is less money for vital public services

39
0:02:18.43,000 --> 0:02:21,000
like healthcare, education, roads.

40
0:02:21.807,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And that affects all of us.

41
0:02:24.152,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Now, for my organization Global Witness,

42
0:02:26.892,000 --> 0:02:3,000
this exposé has been phenomenal.

43
0:02:30.978,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We have the world's media and political leaders

44
0:02:35.49,000 --> 0:02:39,000
talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy

45
0:02:40.169,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to hide and disguise their assets --

46
0:02:42.588,000 --> 0:02:46,000
something we have been talking about and exposing for a decade.

47
0:02:47.396,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Now, I think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing,

48
0:02:52.055,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works.

49
0:02:56.544,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I like to think of it a bit like a Russian doll.

50
0:02:59.4,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So you can have one company stacked inside another company,

51
0:03:02.883,000 --> 0:03:04,000
stacked inside another company,

52
0:03:05.018,000 --> 0:03:09,000
making it almost impossible to really understand

53
0:03:09.453,000 --> 0:03:11,000
who is behind these structures.

54
0:03:11.704,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It can be very difficult for law enforcement

55
0:03:14.641,000 --> 0:03:16,000
or tax authorities, journalists, civil society

56
0:03:17.628,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to really understand what's going on.

57
0:03:20.318,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I also think it's interesting

58
0:03:21.779,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that there's been less coverage of this issue in the United States.

59
0:03:25.01,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And that's perhaps because some prominent US people

60
0:03:28.797,000 --> 0:03:32,000
just haven't figured in this exposé, in this scandal.

61
0:03:33.359,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now, that's not because there are no rich Americans

62
0:03:37.318,000 --> 0:03:39,000
who are stashing their assets offshore.

63
0:03:40.152,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It's just because of the way in which offshore works,

64
0:03:43.998,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Mossack Fonseca has fewer American clients.

65
0:03:47.512,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I think if we saw leaks from the Cayman Islands

66
0:03:50.792,000 --> 0:03:53,000
or even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada,

67
0:03:54.467,000 --> 0:03:59,000
you would see many more cases and examples linking back to Americans.

68
0:04:00.283,000 --> 0:04:05,000
In fact, in a number of US states you need less information,

69
0:04:06.225,000 --> 0:04:1,000
you need to provide less information to get a company

70
0:04:10.423,000 --> 0:04:12,000
than you do to get a library card.

71
0:04:13.24,000 --> 0:04:18,000
That sort of secrecy in America has allowed employees of school districts

72
0:04:19.046,000 --> 0:04:2,000
to rip off schoolchildren.

73
0:04:20.976,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It has allowed scammers to rip off vulnerable investors.

74
0:04:26.452,000 --> 0:04:29,000
This is the sort of behavior that affects all of us.

75
0:04:30.166,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Now, at Global Witness,

76
0:04:32.061,000 --> 0:04:35,000
we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice.

77
0:04:35.346,000 --> 0:04:37,000
How does this actually work?

78
0:04:37.783,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So what we did

79
0:04:38.982,000 --> 0:04:44,000
is we sent in an undercover investigator to 13 Manhattan law firms.

80
0:04:45.763,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Our investigator posed as an African minister

81
0:04:49.561,000 --> 0:04:53,000
who wanted to move suspect funds into the United States

82
0:04:53.712,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to buy a house, a yacht, a jet.

83
0:04:57.288,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Now, what was truly shocking was that all but one of those lawyers

84
0:05:02.373,000 --> 0:05:06,000
provided our investigator with suggestions

85
0:05:06.99,000 --> 0:05:07,000
on how to move those suspect funds.

86
0:05:08.978,000 --> 0:05:09,000
These were all preliminary meetings,

87
0:05:10.814,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and none of the lawyers took us on as a client

88
0:05:13.11,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and of course no money moved hands,

89
0:05:15.423,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but it really shows the problem with the system.

90
0:05:18.905,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It's also important

91
0:05:20.848,000 --> 0:05:23,000
to not just think about this as individual cases.

92
0:05:24.238,000 --> 0:05:26,000
This is not just about an individual lawyer

93
0:05:26.475,000 --> 0:05:29,000
who's spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions.

94
0:05:30.353,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It's not just about a particular senior politician

95
0:05:33.232,000 --> 0:05:34,000
who's been caught up in a scandal.

96
0:05:34.885,000 --> 0:05:37,000
This is about how a system works,

97
0:05:37.965,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that entrenches corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.

98
0:05:43.932,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And in order to tackle this,

99
0:05:45.771,000 --> 0:05:46,000
we need to change the game.

100
0:05:47.466,000 --> 0:05:49,000
We need to change the rules of the game

101
0:05:50.012,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to make this sort of behavior harder.

102
0:05:52.028,000 --> 0:05:54,000
This may seem like doom and gloom,

103
0:05:54.996,000 --> 0:05:55,000
like there's nothing we can do about it,

104
0:05:56.941,000 --> 0:05:57,000
like nothing has ever changed,

105
0:05:58.595,000 --> 0:06:01,000
like there will always be rich and powerful individuals.

106
0:06:01.955,000 --> 0:06:03,000
But as a natural optimist,

107
0:06:04.426,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I do see that we are starting to get some change.

108
0:06:07.928,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Over the last couple of years,

109
0:06:09.827,000 --> 0:06:12,000
we've seen a real push towards greater transparency

110
0:06:13.519,000 --> 0:06:14,000
when it comes to company ownership.

111
0:06:15.755,000 --> 0:06:17,000
This issue was put on the political agenda

112
0:06:18.116,000 --> 0:06:2,000
by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron

113
0:06:20.634,000 --> 0:06:24,000
at a big G8 Summit that was held in Northern Ireland in 2013.

114
0:06:25.872,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And since then, the European Union is going to be creating

115
0:06:30.246,000 --> 0:06:32,000
central registers at a national level

116
0:06:32.427,000 --> 0:06:35,000
of who really owns and controls companies across Europe.

117
0:06:35.858,000 --> 0:06:39,000
One of the things that is sad is that, actually, the US is lagging behind.

118
0:06:40.958,000 --> 0:06:42,000
There's bipartisan legislation that had been introduced

119
0:06:43.682,000 --> 0:06:44,000
in the House and the Senate,

120
0:06:45.609,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but it isn't making as much progress as we'd like to see.

121
0:06:48.79,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So we'd really want to see the Panama leaks,

122
0:06:51.901,000 --> 0:06:54,000
this huge peek into the offshore world,

123
0:06:55.719,000 --> 0:07:,000
be used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world.

124
0:07:00.795,000 --> 0:07:04,000
For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.

125
0:07:05.95,000 --> 0:07:08,000
We need ordinary people to get angry

126
0:07:09.722,000 --> 0:07:12,000
at the way in which people can hide their identity

127
0:07:12.999,000 --> 0:07:13,000
behind secret companies.

128
0:07:14.936,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We need business leaders to stand up and say,

129
0:07:18.547,000 --> 0:07:21,000
"Secrecy like this is not good for business."

130
0:07:21.855,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We need political leaders to recognize the problem,

131
0:07:26.259,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy.

132
0:07:31.639,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Together, we can end the secrecy

133
0:07:34.942,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that is currently allowing tax evasion,

134
0:07:38.023,000 --> 0:07:41,000
corruption, money laundering to flourish.

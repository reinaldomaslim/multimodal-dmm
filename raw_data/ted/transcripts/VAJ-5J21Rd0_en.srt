2
0:00:15.997,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Human beings start putting each other into boxes

3
0:00:18.426,000 --> 0:00:19,000
the second that they see each other --

4
0:00:20.243,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Is that person dangerous? Are they attractive?

5
0:00:23.313,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Are they a potential mate? Are they a potential networking opportunity?

6
0:00:26.579,000 --> 0:00:28,000
We do this little interrogation when we meet people

7
0:00:29.113,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to make a mental resume for them.

8
0:00:31.28,000 --> 0:00:32,000
What's your name? Where are you from?

9
0:00:32.797,000 --> 0:00:35,000
How old are you? What do you do?

10
0:00:36.158,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Then we get more personal with it.

11
0:00:38.959,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Have you ever had any diseases?

12
0:00:42.107,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Have you ever been divorced?

13
0:00:44.094,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Does your breath smell bad while you're answering my interrogation right now?

14
0:00:47.54,000 --> 0:00:48,000
What are you into? Who are you into?

15
0:00:49.257,000 --> 0:00:5,000
What gender do you like to sleep with?

16
0:00:51.123,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I get it.

17
0:00:53.553,000 --> 0:00:54,000
We are neurologically hardwired

18
0:00:55.305,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to seek out people like ourselves.

19
0:00:57.689,000 --> 0:00:59,000
We start forming cliques as soon as we're old enough

20
0:00:59.874,000 --> 0:01:,000
to know what acceptance feels like.

21
0:01:01.807,000 --> 0:01:03,000
We bond together based on anything that we can --

22
0:01:04.157,000 --> 0:01:09,000
music preference, race, gender, the block that we grew up on.

23
0:01:09.609,000 --> 0:01:15,000
We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices.

24
0:01:16.497,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Sometimes, though, just the question "what do you do?"

25
0:01:18.958,000 --> 0:01:19,000
can feel like somebody's opening a tiny little box

26
0:01:20.918,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it.

27
0:01:22.447,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Because the categories, I've found, are too limiting.

28
0:01:26.014,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The boxes are too narrow.

29
0:01:27.898,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And this can get really dangerous.

30
0:01:30.015,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So here's a disclaimer about me, though,

31
0:01:31.796,000 --> 0:01:32,000
before we get too deep into this.

32
0:01:33.398,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I grew up in a very sheltered environment.

33
0:01:36.383,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s,

34
0:01:40.329,000 --> 0:01:43,000
two blocks from the epicenter of punk music.

35
0:01:44.224,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I was shielded from the pains of bigotry

36
0:01:46.314,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing.

37
0:01:50.414,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Where I come from, if you weren't a drag queen or a radical thinker

38
0:01:53.835,000 --> 0:01:55,000
or a performance artist of some kind,

39
0:01:55.963,000 --> 0:01:56,000
you were the weirdo.

40
0:01:57.947,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

41
0:01:59.23,000 --> 0:02:01,000
It was an unorthodox upbringing,

42
0:02:01.315,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but as a kid on the streets of New York,

43
0:02:03.826,000 --> 0:02:04,000
you learn how to trust your own instincts,

44
0:02:05.797,000 --> 0:02:07,000
you learn how to go with your own ideas.

45
0:02:08.73,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So when I was six, I decided that I wanted to be a boy.

46
0:02:11.969,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I went to school one day and the kids wouldn't let me play basketball with them.

47
0:02:15.436,000 --> 0:02:16,000
They said they wouldn't let girls play.

48
0:02:16.869,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So I went home, and I shaved my head,

49
0:02:18.279,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and I came back the next day and I said, "I'm a boy."

50
0:02:20.901,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I mean, who knows, right?

51
0:02:21.915,000 --> 0:02:24,000
When you're six, maybe you can do that.

52
0:02:25.728,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I didn't want anyone to know that I was a girl, and they didn't.

53
0:02:29.361,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I kept up the charade for eight years.

54
0:02:32.003,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So this is me when I was 11.

55
0:02:36.17,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I was playing a kid named Walter

56
0:02:37.681,000 --> 0:02:39,000
in a movie called "Julian Po."

57
0:02:39.87,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him.

58
0:02:43.304,000 --> 0:02:45,000
See, I was also a child actor,

59
0:02:45.354,000 --> 0:02:47,000
which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity,

60
0:02:48.036,000 --> 0:02:54,000
because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy.

61
0:02:54.124,000 --> 0:02:57,000
In fact, no one in my life knew that I was a girl --

62
0:02:57.24,000 --> 0:02:59,000
not my teachers at school, not my friends,

63
0:02:59.556,000 --> 0:03:,000
not the directors that I worked with.

64
0:03:01.408,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Kids would often come up to me in class

65
0:03:03.673,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam's apple

66
0:03:05.907,000 --> 0:03:08,000
or grab my crotch to check what I was working with.

67
0:03:09.256,000 --> 0:03:11,000
When I would go to the bathroom, I would turn my shoes around in the stalls

68
0:03:11.617,000 --> 0:03:13,000
so that it looked like I was peeing standing up.

69
0:03:14.172,000 --> 0:03:16,000
At sleepovers I would have panic attacks

70
0:03:16.24,000 --> 0:03:18,000
trying to break it to girls that they didn't want to kiss me

71
0:03:18.624,000 --> 0:03:19,000
without outing myself.

72
0:03:20.356,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It's worth mentioning though

73
0:03:22.408,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that I didn't hate my body or my genitalia.

74
0:03:26.257,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I didn't feel like I was in the wrong body.

75
0:03:28.024,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I felt like I was performing this elaborate act.

76
0:03:30.056,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I wouldn't have qualified as transgender.

77
0:03:33.883,000 --> 0:03:35,000
If my family, though, had been the kind of people to believe in therapy,

78
0:03:36.129,000 --> 0:03:37,000
they probably would have diagnosed me

79
0:03:37.852,000 --> 0:03:38,000
as something like gender dysmorphic

80
0:03:39.638,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and put me on hormones to stave off puberty.

81
0:03:42.041,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But in my particular case,

82
0:03:42.925,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I just woke up one day when I was 14,

83
0:03:44.64,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again.

84
0:03:47.223,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Puberty had hit, and I had no idea what being a girl meant,

85
0:03:50.223,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and I was ready to figure out who I actually was.

86
0:03:53.848,000 --> 0:03:55,000
When a kid behaves like I did,

87
0:03:56.253,000 --> 0:03:57,000
they don't exactly have to come out, right?

88
0:03:58.089,000 --> 0:04:,000
No one is exactly shocked.

89
0:04:00.35,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:04.094,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But I wasn't asked to define myself by my parents.

91
0:04:08.557,000 --> 0:04:09,000
When I was 15, and I called my father

92
0:04:10.423,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to tell him that I had fallen in love,

93
0:04:12.123,000 --> 0:04:14,000
it was the last thing on either of our minds

94
0:04:14.423,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to discuss what the consequences were

95
0:04:16.039,000 --> 0:04:18,000
of the fact that my first love was a girl.

96
0:04:18.457,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Three years later, when I fell in love with a man,

97
0:04:20.739,000 --> 0:04:22,000
neither of my parents batted an eyelash either.

98
0:04:23.323,000 --> 0:04:26,000
See, it's one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood

99
0:04:26.706,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that I wasn't ever asked to define myself

100
0:04:28.74,000 --> 0:04:3,000
as any one thing at any point.

101
0:04:31.087,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I was just allowed to be me, growing and changing in every moment.

102
0:04:34.906,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So four, almost five years ago,

103
0:04:37.951,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Proposition 8, the great marriage equality debate,

104
0:04:41.266,000 --> 0:04:42,000
was raising a lot of dust around this country.

105
0:04:43.241,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And at the time, getting married wasn't really something

106
0:04:45.852,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I spent a lot of time thinking about.

107
0:04:46.985,000 --> 0:04:48,000
But I was struck by the fact that America,

108
0:04:49.791,000 --> 0:04:51,000
a country with such a tarnished civil rights record,

109
0:04:51.856,000 --> 0:04:53,000
could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly.

110
0:04:54.472,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And I remember watching the discussion on television

111
0:04:56.44,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and thinking how interesting it was

112
0:04:58.241,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that the separation of church and state

113
0:05:01.272,000 --> 0:05:04,000
was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country,

114
0:05:04.891,000 --> 0:05:05,000
between places where people believed in it

115
0:05:06.473,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and places where people didn't.

116
0:05:08.258,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And then, that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me.

117
0:05:14.506,000 --> 0:05:17,000
If this was a war with two disparate sides,

118
0:05:17.624,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I, by default, fell on team gay,

119
0:05:20.405,000 --> 0:05:23,000
because I certainly wasn't 100 percent straight.

120
0:05:23.591,000 --> 0:05:26,000
At the time I was just beginning to emerge

121
0:05:26.84,000 --> 0:05:29,000
from this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag

122
0:05:30.757,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that saw me go from being a boy

123
0:05:32.59,000 --> 0:05:35,000
to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl's clothes

124
0:05:35.812,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy,

125
0:05:38.602,000 --> 0:05:4,000
over-compensating, boy-chasing girly-girl

126
0:05:41.268,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was,

127
0:05:45.236,000 --> 0:05:47,000
a tomboyish girl

128
0:05:47.643,000 --> 0:05:5,000
who liked both boys and girls depending on the person.

129
0:05:50.852,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls, much like myself,

130
0:05:56.003,000 --> 0:05:57,000
who fell kind of between-the-lines --

131
0:05:57.669,000 --> 0:06:,000
girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear,

132
0:06:01.206,000 --> 0:06:04,000
girls who had boys' haircuts but wore girly nail polish,

133
0:06:05.164,000 --> 0:06:07,000
girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees,

134
0:06:08.159,000 --> 0:06:11,000
girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls

135
0:06:11.257,000 --> 0:06:12,000
who all hated being boxed in to anything.

136
0:06:13.106,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I loved these people, and I admired their freedom,

137
0:06:16.857,000 --> 0:06:18,000
but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble

138
0:06:19.79,000 --> 0:06:2,000
exploded into these raging debates

139
0:06:21.64,000 --> 0:06:26,000
where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television.

140
0:06:27.206,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And this powerful awareness rolled in over me

141
0:06:29.539,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that I was a minority, and in my own home country,

142
0:06:34.906,000 --> 0:06:36,000
based on one facet of my character.

143
0:06:37.557,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen.

144
0:06:43.172,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I was not an activist.

145
0:06:44.706,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I wave no flags in my own life.

146
0:06:47.206,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But I was plagued by this question:

147
0:06:49.345,000 --> 0:06:51,000
How could anyone vote to strip the rights

148
0:06:52.291,000 --> 0:06:54,000
of the vast variety of people that I knew

149
0:06:54.456,000 --> 0:06:57,000
based on one element of their character?

150
0:06:57.89,000 --> 0:06:58,000
How could they say that we as a group

151
0:06:59.406,000 --> 0:07:01,000
were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else?

152
0:07:02.339,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Were we even a group? What group?

153
0:07:04.706,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination?

154
0:07:08.573,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was?

155
0:07:12.616,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And then it occurred to me,

156
0:07:14.507,000 --> 0:07:16,000
perhaps if they could look into the eyes

157
0:07:16.79,000 --> 0:07:19,000
of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship

158
0:07:20.571,000 --> 0:07:21,000
it might make it harder for them to do.

159
0:07:22.473,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It might give them pause.

160
0:07:24.457,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Obviously I couldn't get 20 million people to the same dinner party,

161
0:07:30.297,000 --> 0:07:34,000
so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically

162
0:07:34.628,000 --> 0:07:36,000
without any artifice, without any lighting,

163
0:07:37.594,000 --> 0:07:4,000
or without any manipulation of any kind on my part.

164
0:07:40.828,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Because in a photograph you can examine a lion's whiskers

165
0:07:43.578,000 --> 0:07:45,000
without the fear of him ripping your face off.

166
0:07:46.294,000 --> 0:07:49,000
For me, photography is not just about exposing film,

167
0:07:49.691,000 --> 0:07:5,000
it's about exposing the viewer

168
0:07:51.644,000 --> 0:07:53,000
to something new, a place they haven't gone before,

169
0:07:53.745,000 --> 0:07:56,000
but most importantly, to people that they might be afraid of.

170
0:07:57.06,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Life magazine introduced generations of people

171
0:07:58.904,000 --> 0:08:02,000
to distant, far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures.

172
0:08:02.978,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits,

173
0:08:09.211,000 --> 0:08:1,000
mugshots if you will.

174
0:08:10.961,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country

175
0:08:14.729,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that was not 100 percent straight,

176
0:08:17.13,000 --> 0:08:2,000
which, if you don't know, is a limitless number of people.

177
0:08:20.313,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Laughter)

178
0:08:22.363,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So this was a very large undertaking,

179
0:08:25.029,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and to do it we needed some help.

180
0:08:26.913,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So I ran out in the freezing cold,

181
0:08:29.446,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to

182
0:08:32.854,000 --> 0:08:35,000
in February of about two years ago.

183
0:08:36.824,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And I took those photographs, and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help.

184
0:08:40.947,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York.

185
0:08:43.313,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And then we made this.

186
0:08:46.324,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Music)

187
0:08:58.601,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Video: I'm iO Tillett Wright, and I'm an artist born and raised in New York City.

188
0:09:02.784,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Music)

189
0:09:16.092,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today.

190
0:09:20.754,000 --> 0:09:21,000
My aim is to take a simple portrait

191
0:09:22.377,000 --> 0:09:24,000
of anyone who's anything other than 100 percent straight

192
0:09:25.027,000 --> 0:09:3,000
or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way.

193
0:09:30.247,000 --> 0:09:32,000
My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us

194
0:09:33.245,000 --> 0:09:35,000
through the simplicity of a face.

195
0:09:35.363,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Music)

196
0:09:38.051,000 --> 0:09:41,000
"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal."

197
0:09:41.141,000 --> 0:09:43,000
It's written in the Declaration of Independence.

198
0:09:43.558,000 --> 0:09:44,000
We are failing as a nation

199
0:09:44.825,000 --> 0:09:46,000
to uphold the morals upon which we were founded.

200
0:09:46.934,000 --> 0:09:48,000
There is no equality in the United States.

201
0:09:49.156,000 --> 0:09:51,000
["What does equality mean to you?"]

202
0:09:51.539,000 --> 0:09:52,000
["Marriage"] ["Freedom"] ["Civil rights"]

203

["Treat every person as you'd treat yourself"]

204
0:09:55.303,000 --> 0:09:58,000
It's when you don't have to think about it, simple as that.

205
0:09:58.923,000 --> 0:10:,000
The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage.

206
0:10:01.713,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Today in 29 states, more than half of this country,

207
0:10:05.809,000 --> 0:10:09,000
you can legally be fired just for your sexuality.

208
0:10:10.18,000 --> 0:10:13,000
["Who is responsible for equality?"]

209
0:10:13.331,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I've heard hundreds of people give the same answer:

210
0:10:16.342,000 --> 0:10:19,000
"We are all responsible for equality."

211
0:10:19.818,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So far we've shot 300 faces in New York City.

212
0:10:22.671,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And we wouldn't have been able to do any of it

213
0:10:24.087,000 --> 0:10:26,000
without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign.

214
0:10:26.972,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I want to take the project across the country.

215
0:10:28.921,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I want to visit 25 American cities, and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people.

216
0:10:33.004,000 --> 0:10:36,000
This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation.

217
0:10:36.987,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I challenge you to look into the faces of these people

218
0:10:39.164,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being.

0:10:52.569,000 --> 0:11:,000

0:11:00.817,000 --> 0:11:04,000
iO Tillett Wright: Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that.

225
0:11:05.1,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Almost 85,000 people watched that video,

226
0:11:08.35,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and then they started emailing us from all over the country,

227
0:11:10.85,000 --> 0:11:14,000
asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces.

228
0:11:15.517,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated.

229
0:11:19.867,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces.

230
0:11:23.368,000 --> 0:11:27,000
That video was made in the spring of 2011,

231
0:11:27.433,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities

232
0:11:30.89,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and photographed almost 2,000 people.

233
0:11:33.796,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I know that this is a talk,

234
0:11:36.806,000 --> 0:11:39,000
but I'd like to have a minute of just quiet

235
0:11:40.072,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and have you just look at these faces

236
0:11:41.321,000 --> 0:11:44,000
because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them.

237
0:11:45.191,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Because if a picture is worth a thousand words,

238
0:11:47.724,000 --> 0:11:5,000
then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary.

239
0:12:12.329,000 --> 0:12:15,000
So after traveling and talking to people

240
0:12:16.008,000 --> 0:12:19,000
in places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas,

241
0:12:19.856,000 --> 0:12:22,000
we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on.

242
0:12:23.391,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Visibility really is key.

243
0:12:25.277,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy.

244
0:12:28.54,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family,

245
0:12:31.99,000 --> 0:12:33,000
you're far more likely to explore sympathy for it

246
0:12:34.907,000 --> 0:12:35,000
or explore a new perspective on it.

247
0:12:36.473,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Of course, in my travels I met people

248
0:12:39.124,000 --> 0:12:43,000
who legally divorced their children for being other than straight,

249
0:12:43.323,000 --> 0:12:45,000
but I also met people who were Southern Baptists

250
0:12:45.691,000 --> 0:12:48,000
who switched churches because their child was a lesbian.

251
0:12:48.707,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths.

252
0:12:52.857,000 --> 0:12:55,000
But here's what I was starting to learn that was really interesting:

253
0:12:56.273,000 --> 0:13:,000
Self Evident Truths doesn't erase the differences between us.

254
0:13:00.623,000 --> 0:13:03,000
In fact, on the contrary, it highlights them.

255
0:13:04.007,000 --> 0:13:06,000
It presents, not just the complexities

256
0:13:06.106,000 --> 0:13:08,000
found in a procession of different human beings,

257
0:13:08.273,000 --> 0:13:11,000
but the complexities found within each individual person.

258
0:13:11.873,000 --> 0:13:15,000
It wasn't that we had too many boxes, it was that we had too few.

259
0:13:22.778,000 --> 0:13:28,000
At some point I realized that my mission to photograph "gays" was inherently flawed,

260
0:13:29.563,000 --> 0:13:32,000
because there were a million different shades of gay.

261
0:13:32.751,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Here I was trying to help,

262
0:13:35.497,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid --

263
0:13:38.69,000 --> 0:13:4,000
yet another box.

264
0:13:41.196,000 --> 0:13:44,000
At some point I added a question to the release form

265
0:13:44.416,000 --> 0:13:45,000
that asked people to quantify themselves

266
0:13:46.345,000 --> 0:13:48,000
on a scale of one to 100 percent gay.

267
0:13:49.145,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me.

268
0:13:53.061,000 --> 0:13:55,000
(Laughter)

269
0:13:55.862,000 --> 0:13:56,000
People didn't know what to do

270
0:13:57.062,000 --> 0:13:59,000
because they had never been presented with the option before.

271
0:13:59.465,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Can you quantify your openness?

272
0:14:01.652,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Once they got over the shock, though,

273
0:14:03.562,000 --> 0:14:07,000
by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent

274
0:14:07.645,000 --> 0:14:09,000
or the 3 to 20 percent marks.

275
0:14:10.162,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Of course, there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other,

276
0:14:12.863,000 --> 0:14:14,000
but I found that a much larger proportion of people

277
0:14:15.331,000 --> 0:14:17,000
identified as something that was much more nuanced.

278
0:14:18.18,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as "Grey."

279
0:14:24.389,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Let me be clear though -- and this is very important --

280
0:14:28.373,000 --> 0:14:32,000
in no way am I saying that preference doesn't exist.

281
0:14:33.089,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative,

282
0:14:37.889,000 --> 0:14:39,000
because if any of you happen to be of the belief

283
0:14:40.756,000 --> 0:14:41,000
that sexual orientation is a choice,

284
0:14:42.623,000 --> 0:14:43,000
I invite you to go out and try to be grey.

285
0:14:44.156,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I'll take your picture just for trying.

286
0:14:46.422,000 --> 0:14:47,000
(Laughter)

287
0:14:47.805,000 --> 0:14:51,000
What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional.

288
0:14:52.222,000 --> 0:14:57,000
The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this:

289
0:14:57.99,000 --> 0:14:59,000
If you have gay people over here

290
0:15:00.207,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and you have straight people over here,

291
0:15:03.855,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and while we recognize that most people identify

292
0:15:06.823,000 --> 0:15:08,000
as somewhere closer to one binary or another,

293
0:15:09.526,000 --> 0:15:13,000
there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between.

294
0:15:14.472,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And the reality that this presents is a complicated one.

295
0:15:17.506,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Because, for example, if you pass a law

296
0:15:19.79,000 --> 0:15:22,000
that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior,

297
0:15:23.293,000 --> 0:15:25,000
where exactly do you draw the line?

298
0:15:26.06,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Is it over here, by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far?

299
0:15:31.926,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Or is it over here

300
0:15:33.227,000 --> 0:15:37,000
by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far?

301
0:15:37.326,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen?

302
0:15:41.976,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels

303
0:15:46.792,000 --> 0:15:5,000
is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is.

304
0:15:51.094,000 --> 0:15:53,000
After traveling so much and meeting so many people,

305
0:15:53.705,000 --> 0:15:56,000
let me tell you, there are just as many jerks and sweethearts

306
0:15:57.21,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens

307
0:16:00.159,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and every other polarization you can possibly think of

308
0:16:03.109,000 --> 0:16:05,000
within the LGBT community

309
0:16:05.243,000 --> 0:16:08,000
as there are within the human race.

310
0:16:08.759,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs,

311
0:16:13.377,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle,

312
0:16:17.042,000 --> 0:16:18,000
just being other than straight

313
0:16:18.443,000 --> 0:16:23,000
doesn't necessarily mean that we have anything in common.

314
0:16:23.459,000 --> 0:16:31,000
So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming,

315
0:16:31.86,000 --> 0:16:34,000
as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms,

316
0:16:35.059,000 --> 0:16:4,000
bus shelters, billboards, Facebook pages, screen savers,

317
0:16:40.518,000 --> 0:16:43,000
perhaps in watching this procession of humanity,

318
0:16:43.593,000 --> 0:16:45,000
something interesting and useful will begin to happen.

319
0:16:46.51,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Hopefully these categories, these binaries,

320
0:16:50.227,000 --> 0:16:51,000
these over-simplified boxes

321
0:16:51.976,000 --> 0:16:56,000
will begin to become useless and they'll begin to fall away.

322
0:16:57.042,000 --> 0:17:,000
Because really, they describe nothing that we see

323
0:17:00.46,000 --> 0:17:03,000
and no one that we know and nothing that we are.

324
0:17:03.809,000 --> 0:17:08,000
What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity.

325
0:17:09.41,000 --> 0:17:12,000
And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity.

326
0:17:12.993,000 --> 0:17:16,000
At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights.

327
0:17:17.334,000 --> 0:17:2,000
So is it me particularly

328
0:17:20.893,000 --> 0:17:23,000
that you would choose to deny the right to housing,

329
0:17:24.395,000 --> 0:17:26,000
the right to adopt children, the right to marriage,

330
0:17:27.376,000 --> 0:17:3,000
the freedom to shop here, live here, buy here?

331
0:17:31.009,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Am I the one that you choose to disown

332
0:17:33.088,000 --> 0:17:37,000
as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father,

333
0:17:37.51,000 --> 0:17:39,000
your neighbor, your cousin, your uncle, the president,

334
0:17:39.858,000 --> 0:17:42,000
your police woman or the fireman?

335
0:17:43.308,000 --> 0:17:46,000
It's too late.

336
0:17:46.326,000 --> 0:17:49,000
Because I already am all of those things.

337
0:17:49.627,000 --> 0:17:53,000
We already are all of those things, and we always have been.

338
0:17:53.992,000 --> 0:17:55,000
So please don't greet us as strangers,

339
0:17:56.798,000 --> 0:17:59,000
greet us as your fellow human beings, period.

340
0:18:00.351,000 --> 0:18:01,000
Thank you.

341
0:18:01.667,000 --> 0:18:11,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.968,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I first tried online dating my freshman year of college,

2
0:00:16.39,000 --> 0:00:19,000
which was in 2001, in case you can't see my wrinkle.

3
0:00:20.436,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Now, as you may have noticed, I'm six-feet tall,

4
0:00:22.7,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and when I arrived at my chosen university

5
0:00:24.729,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and realized our men's Division III basketball team averaged five-foot-eight,

6
0:00:29.069,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I abandoned the on-campus scene and went online.

7
0:00:32.45,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Now, back then, online dating was pretty close to the plot

8
0:00:35.202,000 --> 0:00:36,000
of "You've Got Mail."

9
0:00:36.466,000 --> 0:00:39,000
You'd write long emails back and forth for weeks,

10
0:00:39.641,000 --> 0:00:4,000
before you finally met up in real life.

11
0:00:41.64,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Except, in my case, you'd realize you have no chemistry

12
0:00:44.403,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and so now, you're back to square one.

13
0:00:46.696,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So, while online dating has changed a lot in the last 17 years,

14
0:00:50.101,000 --> 0:00:52,000
many of the frustrations remain the same.

15
0:00:53.347,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Because here's what it does well.

16
0:00:55.577,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It broadens your pool of potential dates

17
0:00:58.053,000 --> 0:01:,000
beyond your existing social and professional circles.

18
0:01:01.498,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And here's what it doesn't do well.

19
0:01:03.998,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Literally everything else.

20
0:01:06.323,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:08.331,000 --> 0:01:1,000
A few things you should know about me:

22
0:01:10.521,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I'm an action-oriented overachieving math and theater nerd,

23
0:01:13.403,000 --> 0:01:14,000
who ended up with an MBA.

24
0:01:15.101,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So, when things aren't working out, I tend to take a step back,

25
0:01:18.276,000 --> 0:01:21,000
apply my business toolkit to figure out why, and to fix it.

26
0:01:22.014,000 --> 0:01:24,000
My love life was no exception.

27
0:01:24.323,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The summer before I turned 30, I took myself on a relationship off-site.

28
0:01:28.791,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Which means I went camping solo in Maine for a week,

29
0:01:31.253,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to do a retro on my track record of mediocre relationships.

30
0:01:35.236,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Because the thing was, I knew what I wanted in a partner.

31
0:01:38.165,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Kindness, curiosity, empathy, a sense of purpose.

32
0:01:42.736,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And yet, here's what I chose for online:

33
0:01:45.831,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Ivy League degree, six feet or taller,

34
0:01:48.672,000 --> 0:01:5,000
lives within 12 subway stops of me.

35
0:01:51.243,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It's not that I intentionally prioritized those things,

36
0:01:54.034,000 --> 0:01:57,000
it's just the easiest to vet for online.

37
0:01:57.228,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It kind of is like a résumé review,

38
0:01:59.022,000 --> 0:02:01,000
which is why these guys looked great on paper

39
0:02:01.411,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and never quite fit me.

40
0:02:03.585,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So when I went back online in the spring of 2016,

41
0:02:06.045,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I decided to reengineer the process through some classic business tools.

42
0:02:10.53,000 --> 0:02:12,000
First, I went to OkCupid,

43
0:02:12.569,000 --> 0:02:15,000
because I wanted to avoid the gamification of swipe-based apps.

44
0:02:15.871,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And also, because I wanted a writing sample.

45
0:02:19.022,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Next, I set up a sales funnel,

46
0:02:21.276,000 --> 0:02:23,000
throwing out any sense of my type,

47
0:02:23.387,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and instead defining the criteria that would qualify a lead.

48
0:02:27.22,000 --> 0:02:29,000
An inbound message had to do three things:

49
0:02:29.411,000 --> 0:02:32,000
had to be written in complete sentences and with good grammar;

50
0:02:32.601,000 --> 0:02:34,000
it had to reference something in my profile,

51
0:02:34.702,000 --> 0:02:36,000
so I know it's not a copy-and-paste situation;

52
0:02:37.03,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and it had to avoid all sexual content.

53
0:02:40.157,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I figured this was a pretty low bar,

54
0:02:41.935,000 --> 0:02:43,000
but it turns out, of my 210 inbound messages,

55
0:02:44.458,000 --> 0:02:46,000
only 14 percent cleared that hurdle.

56
0:02:46.871,000 --> 0:02:47,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:48.061,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Next, I wanted to meet in real life as quickly as possible,

58
0:02:51.331,000 --> 0:02:53,000
because the things I cared about, I couldn't see online.

59
0:02:54.347,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But the research, and my experience,

60
0:02:56.133,000 --> 0:02:59,000
shows you only need about 30 seconds with someone to tell if you click.

61
0:03:00.581,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So I invented the zero date.

62
0:03:03.391,000 --> 0:03:05,000
The zero date is one drink, one hour.

63
0:03:05.756,000 --> 0:03:07,000
With the goal of answering one question:

64
0:03:08.712,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Would I like to have dinner with this person?

65
0:03:11.173,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Not "are they the one"?

66
0:03:12.577,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Literally, "Would I like to spend three hours across the table

67
0:03:15.997,000 --> 0:03:16,000
from this person?"

68
0:03:18.03,000 --> 0:03:19,000
You tell them you have a hard stop --

69
0:03:19.823,000 --> 0:03:21,000
drinks with girlfriends, a conference call with China --

70
0:03:22.49,000 --> 0:03:23,000
it doesn't matter, they don't know you.

71
0:03:24.387,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The point is one hour.

72
0:03:26.466,000 --> 0:03:28,000
If it's awesome, you schedule a first date.

73
0:03:29.149,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And if it's not awesome, you downshift into entertainer mode

74
0:03:32.315,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and you workshop a few new stories for your next networking event.

75
0:03:35.823,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Plus, because it's just an hour, you can squeeze up to three in one evening

76
0:03:39.387,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and then you only have to do your hair and pick out one great outfit a week.

77
0:03:43.323,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The zero date also gave me a chance to see how they responded

78
0:03:46.244,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to me asking them out.

79
0:03:47.934,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I figured not everyone would dig my moxie, and I was right.

80
0:03:51.553,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Of my 29 qualified leads, only 15 replied to my message,

81
0:03:55.101,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and of those, six scheduled a zero date.

82
0:03:58.3,000 --> 0:04:,000
My first zero date was with a set designer.

83
0:04:00.339,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And we were both into yoga

84
0:04:01.617,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and preferred our bagels with peanut butter,

85
0:04:03.692,000 --> 0:04:04,000
so it looked pretty promising.

86
0:04:05.176,000 --> 0:04:07,000
But two minutes in, I could tell it wasn't going to be a thing

87
0:04:08.12,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and I was relieved not to be spending dinner with him.

88
0:04:10.692,000 --> 0:04:13,000
After that, I was a little nervous about going to my next zero date.

89
0:04:14.061,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But we had agreed to meet on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade

90
0:04:16.894,000 --> 0:04:18,000
with a flask of whiskey to watch the sunset,

91
0:04:18.982,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and honestly, it was two blocks from my apartment.

92
0:04:21.426,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Plus, this guy had a podcast, I have a podcast,

93
0:04:24.355,000 --> 0:04:26,000
worst case scenario, we can talk about our podcasts.

94
0:04:27.331,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Then, Chas set down next to me.

95
0:04:30.688,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And this kind and empathetic man

96
0:04:32.69,000 --> 0:04:35,000
told great jokes and asked even better questions.

97
0:04:36.355,000 --> 0:04:39,000
He was a lawyer and a writer, and his eyes twinkled when he laughed

98
0:04:40.018,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and they squeezed tight when I kissed him

99
0:04:42.05,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and at some point in the evening, our zero date became a first date.

100
0:04:45.502,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And two years later, we have a washer, dryer and two house plants together.

101
0:04:50.064,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Now, I can't promise you're going to end up with house plants.

102
0:04:53.405,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But the point of this story

103
0:04:55.154,000 --> 0:04:57,000
is that online dating doesn't have to suck.

104
0:04:57.889,000 --> 0:05:,000
Don't treat it like a game, and don't treat it like a resume review.

105
0:05:01.436,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Instead, use it to source and qualify leads

106
0:05:04.253,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and then get offline as quickly as possible with the zero date.

107
0:05:08.38,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Because the point of this isn't swiping.

108
0:05:11.063,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It's finding your person.

109
0:05:13.444,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Good luck.

110
0:05:14.619,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Applause)

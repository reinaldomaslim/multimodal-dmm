1
0:00:12.651,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Why are transgender people suddenly everywhere?

2
0:00:15.313,000 --> 0:00:17,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:17.48,000 --> 0:00:19,000
As a trans activist, I get this question a lot.

4
0:00:20.653,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Keep in mind, less than one percent of American adults

5
0:00:23.227,000 --> 0:00:24,000
openly identify as trans.

6
0:00:25.333,000 --> 0:00:28,000
According to a recent GLAAD survey, about 16 percent of non-trans Americans

7
0:00:29.19,000 --> 0:00:31,000
claim to know a trans person in real life.

8
0:00:31.547,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So for the other 84 percent, this may seem like a new topic.

9
0:00:35.021,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But trans people are not new.

10
0:00:38.118,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Gender variance is older than you think,

11
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and trans people are part of that legacy.

12
0:00:43.794,000 --> 0:00:46,000
From central Africa to South America to the Pacific Islands and beyond,

13
0:00:47.802,000 --> 0:00:49,000
there have been populations who recognize multiple genders,

14
0:00:50.817,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and they go way back.

15
0:00:52.714,000 --> 0:00:54,000
The hijra of India and Pakistan, for example,

16
0:00:54.936,000 --> 0:00:57,000
have been cited as far back as 2,000 years ago in the Kama Sutra.

17
0:00:58.983,000 --> 0:01:,000
Indigenous American nations each have their own terms,

18
0:01:01.54,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but most share the umbrella term "two-spirit."

19
0:01:04.722,000 --> 0:01:05,000
They saw gender-variant people

20
0:01:06.247,000 --> 0:01:08,000
as shamans and healers in their communities,

21
0:01:08.641,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and it wasn't until the spread of colonialism

22
0:01:11.686,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that they were taught to think otherwise.

23
0:01:15.387,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now, in researching trans history,

24
0:01:17.341,000 --> 0:01:19,000
we look for both trans people and trans practices.

25
0:01:21.062,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Take, for example, the women who presented as men

26
0:01:23.372,000 --> 0:01:25,000
so they could fight in the US Civil War.

27
0:01:25.974,000 --> 0:01:27,000
After the war, most resumed their lives as women,

28
0:01:28.42,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but some, like Albert Cashier, continued to live as men.

29
0:01:33.326,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Albert was eventually confined to an asylum

30
0:01:35.684,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and forced to wear a dress for the rest of his life.

31
0:01:39.596,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Sighs)

32
0:01:41.277,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Around 1895, a group of self-described androgynes

33
0:01:44.483,000 --> 0:01:45,000
formed the Cercle Hermaphroditos.

34
0:01:46.755,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Their mission was to unite for defense against the world's bitter persecution.

35
0:01:51.256,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And in doing that, they became one of the earliest trans support groups.

36
0:01:55.066,000 --> 0:01:58,000
By the '40s and '50s, medical researchers were starting to study trans medicine,

37
0:01:58.868,000 --> 0:02:,000
but they were aided by their trans patients,

38
0:02:01.019,000 --> 0:02:04,000
like Louise Lawrence, a trans woman who had corresponded extensively

39
0:02:04.448,000 --> 0:02:07,000
with people who had been arrested for public cross-dressing.

40
0:02:08.32,000 --> 0:02:1,000
She introduced sexual researchers like Alfred Kinsey

41
0:02:11.107,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to a massive trans network.

42
0:02:14.058,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Other early figures would follow,

43
0:02:15.694,000 --> 0:02:19,000
like Virginia Prince, Reed Erickson and the famous Christine Jorgensen,

44
0:02:20.637,000 --> 0:02:23,000
who made headlines with her very public transition in 1952.

45
0:02:24.904,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But while white trans suburbanites were forming their own support networks,

46
0:02:28.562,000 --> 0:02:3,000
many trans people of color had to carve their own path.

47
0:02:32.156,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Some, like Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, walked in drag balls.

48
0:02:36.252,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Others were the so-called "street queens,"

49
0:02:38.602,000 --> 0:02:4,000
who were often targeted by police for their gender expression

50
0:02:41.567,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and found themselves on the forefront of seminal events

51
0:02:44.528,000 --> 0:02:45,000
in the LGBT rights movement.

52
0:02:47.178,000 --> 0:02:5,000
This brings us to the riots at Cooper Do-nuts in 1959,

53
0:02:50.76,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Compton's Cafeteria in 1966

54
0:02:53.539,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and the famous Stonewall Inn in 1969.

55
0:02:57.393,000 --> 0:03:,000
In 1970, Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson,

56
0:03:01.306,000 --> 0:03:02,000
two veterans of Stonewall,

57
0:03:03.052,000 --> 0:03:07,000
established STAR: Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries.

58
0:03:08.529,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Trans people continued to fight for equal treatment under the law,

59
0:03:11.987,000 --> 0:03:13,000
even as they faced higher rates of discrimination,

60
0:03:14.672,000 --> 0:03:17,000
unemployment, arrests, and the looming AIDS epidemic.

61
0:03:20.835,000 --> 0:03:21,000
For as long as we've been around,

62
0:03:22.438,000 --> 0:03:24,000
those in power have sought to disenfranchise trans people

63
0:03:25.231,000 --> 0:03:27,000
for daring to live lives that are ours.

64
0:03:28.964,000 --> 0:03:32,000
This motion picture still, taken in Berlin in 1933,

65
0:03:33.06,000 --> 0:03:34,000
is sometimes used in history textbooks

66
0:03:34.972,000 --> 0:03:37,000
to illustrate how the Nazis burned works they considered un-German.

67
0:03:38.914,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But what's rarely mentioned is that included in this massive pile

68
0:03:42.231,000 --> 0:03:44,000
are works from the Institute for Sexual Research.

69
0:03:45.113,000 --> 0:03:48,000
See, I just recapped the trans movement in America,

70
0:03:48.407,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but Magnus Hirschfeld and his peers in Germany

71
0:03:50.606,000 --> 0:03:51,000
had us beat by a few decades.

72
0:03:53.422,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Magnus Hirschfeld was an early advocate for LGBT people.

73
0:03:57.223,000 --> 0:03:59,000
He wrote the first book-length account of trans individuals.

74
0:04:00.114,000 --> 0:04:02,000
He helped them obtain medical services and IDs.

75
0:04:03.008,000 --> 0:04:05,000
He worked with the Berlin Police Department

76
0:04:05.093,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to end discrimination of LGBT people,

77
0:04:06.937,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and he hired them at the Institute.

78
0:04:08.872,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So when the Nazi Party burned his library,

79
0:04:10.923,000 --> 0:04:13,000
it had devastating implications for trans research around the world.

80
0:04:15.214,000 --> 0:04:18,000
This was a deliberate attempt to erase trans people,

81
0:04:18.245,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and it was neither the first nor the last.

82
0:04:22.006,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So whenever people ask me why trans people are suddenly everywhere,

83
0:04:25.308,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I just want to tell them that we've been here.

84
0:04:27.538,000 --> 0:04:28,000
These stories have to be told,

85
0:04:29.023,000 --> 0:04:31,000
along with the countless others that have been buried by time.

86
0:04:31.953,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Not only were our lives not celebrated, but our struggles have been forgotten

87
0:04:35.685,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and, yeah, to some people, that makes trans issues seem new.

88
0:04:38.851,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Today, I meet a lot of people who think that our movement

89
0:04:41.634,000 --> 0:04:43,000
is just a phase that will pass,

90
0:04:43.859,000 --> 0:04:46,000
but I also hear well-intentioned allies telling us all to be patient,

91
0:04:47.431,000 --> 0:04:48,000
because our movement is "still new."

92
0:04:50.819,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Imagine how the conversation would shift

93
0:04:52.793,000 --> 0:04:55,000
if we acknowledge just how long trans people have been demanding equality.

94
0:04:57.605,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Are we still overreacting?

95
0:05:00.197,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Should we continue to wait?

96
0:05:02.401,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Or should we, for example,

97
0:05:04.14,000 --> 0:05:06,000
do something about the trans women of color who are murdered

98
0:05:07.066,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and whose killers never see justice?

99
0:05:10.178,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Do our circumstances seem dire to you yet?

100
0:05:12.992,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Sighs)

101
0:05:14.88,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Finally, I want other trans people to realize they're not alone.

102
0:05:19.535,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I grew up thinking my identity was an anomaly that would die with me.

103
0:05:23.934,000 --> 0:05:25,000
People drilled this idea of otherness into my mind,

104
0:05:26.433,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and I bought it because I didn't know anyone else like me.

105
0:05:30.084,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Maybe if I had known my ancestors sooner,

106
0:05:32.783,000 --> 0:05:34,000
it wouldn't have taken me so long to find a source of pride

107
0:05:35.588,000 --> 0:05:37,000
in my identity and in my community.

108
0:05:39.15,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Because I belong to an amazing, vibrant community of people

109
0:05:42.689,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that uplift each other even when others won't,

110
0:05:45.372,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that take care of each other even when we are struggling,

111
0:05:48.459,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that somehow, despite it all,

112
0:05:50.816,000 --> 0:05:52,000
still find cause to celebrate each other,

113
0:05:53.67,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to love each other,

114
0:05:55.684,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to look one another in the eyes and say,

115
0:05:58.244,000 --> 0:05:59,000
"You are not alone.

116
0:06:01.172,000 --> 0:06:02,000
You have us.

117
0:06:03.027,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And we're not going anywhere."

118
0:06:05.991,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Thank you.

119
0:06:07.166,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Applause)

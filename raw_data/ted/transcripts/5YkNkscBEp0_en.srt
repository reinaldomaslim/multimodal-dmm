1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I write about food. I write about cooking.

2
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I take it quite seriously,

3
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
but I'm here to talk about something

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that's become very important to me in the last year or two.

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se.

6
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow.

7
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I'm not a vegetarian -- this is the old Nixon line, right?

8
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But I still think that this --

9
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
-- may be this year's version of this.

11
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Now, that is only a little bit hyperbolic.

12
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And why do I say it?

13
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Because only once before has the fate of individual people

14
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and the fate of all of humanity

15
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
been so intertwined.

16
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
There was the bomb, and there's now.

17
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And where we go from here is going to determine

18
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
not only the quality and the length of our individual lives,

19
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
but whether, if we could see the Earth a century from now,

20
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
we'd recognize it.

21
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It's a holocaust of a different kind,

22
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and hiding under our desks isn't going to help.

23
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Start with the notion that global warming

24
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
is not only real, but dangerous.

25
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Since every scientist in the world now believes this,

26
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and even President Bush has seen the light, or pretends to,

27
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
we can take this is a given.

28
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Then hear this, please.

29
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
After energy production, livestock is the second-highest contributor

30
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to atmosphere-altering gases.

31
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas

32
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
is generated by livestock production --

33
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
more than transportation.

34
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Now, you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts,

35
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2,

36
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and it's not just methane.

37
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation,

38
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
air and water pollution, water shortages and loss of biodiversity.

39
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
There's more.

40
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Like half the antibiotics in this country

41
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
are not administered to people, but to animals.

42
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But lists like this become kind of numbing, so let me just say this:

43
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
if you're a progressive,

44
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
if you're driving a Prius, or you're shopping green,

45
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
or you're looking for organic,

46
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
you should probably be a semi-vegetarian.

47
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Now, I'm no more anti-cattle than I am anti-atom,

48
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but it's all in the way we use these things.

49
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
There's another piece of the puzzle,

50
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
which Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday,

51
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and one you already know.

52
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
There's no question, none, that so-called lifestyle diseases --

53
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
diabetes, heart disease, stroke, some cancers --

54
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
are diseases that are far more prevalent here

55
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
than anywhere in the rest of the world.

56
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And that's the direct result of eating a Western diet.

57
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Our demand for meat, dairy and refined carbohydrates --

58
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day --

59
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
our demand for these things, not our need, our want,

60
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us.

61
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And those calories are in foods that cause, not prevent, disease.

62
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Now global warming was unforeseen.

63
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
We didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility.

64
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Maybe a few lung diseases here and there,

65
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
but, you know, that's not such a big deal.

66
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The current health crisis, however,

67
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
is a little more the work of the evil empire.

68
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We were told, we were assured,

69
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate,

70
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
the healthier we'd be.

71
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
No. Overconsumption of animals, and of course, junk food,

72
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
is the problem, along with our paltry consumption of plants.

73
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Now, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here,

74
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
but the evidence is that plants -- and I want to make this clear --

75
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
it's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants.

76
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It's not the beta-carotene, it's the carrot.

77
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The evidence is very clear that plants promote health.

78
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
This evidence is overwhelming at this point.

79
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
You eat more plants, you eat less other stuff, you live longer.

80
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Not bad.

81
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
But back to animals and junk food.

82
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
What do they have in common?

83
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
One: we don't need either of them for health.

84
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We don't need animal products,

85
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and we certainly don't need white bread or Coke.

86
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Two: both have been marketed heavily,

87
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
creating unnatural demand.

88
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles.

89
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Three: their production has been supported by government agencies

90
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
at the expense of a more health- and Earth-friendly diet.

91
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Now, let's imagine a parallel.

92
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Let's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy,

93
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy,

94
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
knowing all the while that the result would be

95
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
pollution, war and rising costs.

96
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Incredible, isn't it?

97
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Yet they do that.

98
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And they do this here. It's the same deal.

99
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
The sad thing is, when it comes to diet,

100
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
is that even when well-intentioned Feds

101
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
try to do right by us, they fail.

102
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Either they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness,

103
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
or they are puppets of agribusiness.

104
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So, when the USDA finally acknowledged

105
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy,

106
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
they encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid,

107
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day,

108
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
along with more carbs.

109
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
What they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others,

110
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and that plants and whole grains

111
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
should be supplanting eating junk food.

112
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But industry lobbyists would never let that happen.

113
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And guess what?

114
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Half the people who developed the food pyramid

115
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
have ties to agribusiness.

116
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So, instead of substituting plants for animals,

117
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
our swollen appetites simply became larger,

118
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged.

119
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So-called low-fat diets, so-called low-carb diets --

120
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
these are not solutions.

121
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
But with lots of intelligent people

122
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
focusing on whether food is organic or local,

123
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
or whether we're being nice to animals,

124
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
the most important issues just aren't being addressed.

125
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Now, don't get me wrong.

126
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I like animals,

127
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production

128
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and to churn them out like they were wrenches.

129
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But there's no way to treat animals well,

130
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
when you're killing 10 billion of them a year.

131
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
That's our number. 10 billion.

132
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
If you strung all of them --

133
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
chickens, cows, pigs and lambs -- to the moon,

134
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
they'd go there and back five times, there and back.

135
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Now, my math's a little shaky, but this is pretty good,

136
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long,

137
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
but you get the idea.

138
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
That's just the United States.

139
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And with our hyper-consumption of those animals

140
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
producing greenhouse gases and heart disease,

141
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
kindness might just be a bit of a red herring.

142
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
Let's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down,

143
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left.

144
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Another red herring might be exemplified by the word "locavore,"

145
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary.

146
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Seriously.

147
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And locavore, for those of you who don't know,

148
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
is someone who eats only locally grown food --

149
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
which is fine if you live in California,

150
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke.

151
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Between the official story -- the food pyramid --

152
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and the hip locavore vision,

153
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
you have two versions of how to improve our eating.

154
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Laughter).

155
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
They both get it wrong, though.

156
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
The first at least is populist, and the second is elitist.

157
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States.

158
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And I'm going to go through that,

159
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
at least the last hundred years or so, very quickly right now.

160
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
A hundred years ago, guess what?

161
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Everyone was a locavore: even New York had pig farms nearby,

162
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion.

163
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
Every family had a cook, usually a mom.

164
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And those moms bought and prepared food.

165
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
It was like your romantic vision of Europe.

166
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Margarine didn't exist.

167
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
In fact, when margarine was invented,

168
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink,

169
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
so we'd all know that it was a fake.

170
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
There was no snack food, and until the '20s,

171
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
until Clarence Birdseye came along, there was no frozen food.

172
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
There were no restaurant chains.

173
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people,

174
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
but none of them would think to open another one.

175
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic.

176
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And fancy food was entirely French.

177
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
As an aside, those of you who remember

178
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Dan Aykroyd in the 1970s doing Julia Child imitations

179
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide.

180
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Laughter)

181
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Back in those days, before even Julia,

182
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
back in those days, there was no philosophy of food.

183
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
You just ate.

184
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
You didn't claim to be anything.

185
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
There was no marketing. There were no national brands.

186
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Vitamins had not been invented.

187
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
There were no health claims, at least not federally sanctioned ones.

188
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Fats, carbs, proteins -- they weren't bad or good, they were food.

189
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
You ate food.

190
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient,

191
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
because it was an ingredient.

192
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The cornflake hadn't been invented.

193
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
(Laughter)

194
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The Pop-Tart, the Pringle, Cheez Whiz, none of that stuff.

195
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Goldfish swam.

196
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Laughter)

197
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
It's hard to imagine. People grew food, and they ate food.

198
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And again, everyone ate local.

199
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
In New York, an orange was a common Christmas present,

200
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
because it came all the way from Florida.

201
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
From the '30s on, road systems expanded,

202
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
trucks took the place of railroads,

203
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
fresh food began to travel more.

204
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Oranges became common in New York.

205
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
The South and West became agricultural hubs,

206
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and in other parts of the country, suburbs took over farmland.

207
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
The effects of this are well known. They are everywhere.

208
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And the death of family farms is part of this puzzle,

209
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
as is almost everything

210
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
from the demise of the real community

211
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to the challenge of finding a good tomato, even in summer.

212
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Eventually, California produced too much food to ship fresh,

213
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods.

214
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Thus arrived convenience.

215
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
It was sold to proto-feminist housewives

216
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
as a way to cut down on housework.

217
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Now, I know everybody over the age of, like 45 --

218
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
their mouths are watering at this point.

219
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
(Laughter)

220
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
(Applause)

221
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
If we had a slide of Salisbury steak, even more so, right?

222
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
(Laughter)

223
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
But this may have cut down on housework,

224
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well.

225
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable

226
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad.

227
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I, for one -- and I'm not kidding --

228
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
didn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19.

229
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Who needed it though? Meat was everywhere.

230
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
What could be easier, more filling or healthier for your family

231
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
than broiling a steak?

232
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally.

233
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Rather than spending their lives eating grass,

234
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
for which their stomachs were designed,

235
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
they were forced to eat soy and corn.

236
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
They have trouble digesting those grains, of course,

237
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
but that wasn't a problem for producers.

238
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
New drugs kept them healthy.

239
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Well, they kept them alive.

240
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Healthy was another story.

241
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Thanks to farm subsidies,

242
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress,

243
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
soy, corn and cattle became king.

244
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And chicken soon joined them on the throne.

245
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
It was during this period that the cycle of

246
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
dietary and planetary destruction began,

247
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
the thing we're only realizing just now.

248
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Listen to this,

249
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
between 1950 and 2000, the world's population doubled.

250
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Meat consumption increased five-fold.

251
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Now, someone had to eat all that stuff, so we got fast food.

252
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And this took care of the situation resoundingly.

253
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Home cooking remained the norm, but its quality was down the tubes.

254
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
There were fewer meals with home-cooked breads, desserts and soups,

255
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
because all of them could be bought at any store.

256
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Not that they were any good, but they were there.

257
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Most moms cooked like mine:

258
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
a piece of broiled meat, a quickly made salad with bottled dressing,

259
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
canned soup, canned fruit salad.

260
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Maybe baked or mashed potatoes,

261
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
or perhaps the stupidest food ever, Minute Rice.

262
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
For dessert, store-bought ice cream or cookies.

263
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
My mom is not here, so I can say this now.

264
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself.

265
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
(Laughter)

266
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
It wasn't all bad.

267
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
By the '70s, forward-thinking people

268
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
began to recognize the value of local ingredients.

269
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
We tended gardens, we became interested in organic food,

270
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
we knew or we were vegetarians.

271
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
We weren't all hippies, either.

272
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well.

273
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Meanwhile, food production had become industrial. Industrial.

274
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Perhaps because it was being produced rationally,

275
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
as if it were plastic,

276
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
food gained magical or poisonous powers, or both.

277
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Many people became fat-phobic.

278
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Others worshiped broccoli, as if it were God-like.

279
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
But mostly they didn't eat broccoli.

280
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Instead they were sold on yogurt,

281
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
yogurt being almost as good as broccoli.

282
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Except, in reality, the way the industry sold yogurt

283
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream.

284
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Similarly, let's look at a granola bar.

285
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
You think that that might be healthy food,

286
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
but in fact, if you look at the ingredient list,

287
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
it's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal.

288
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Sadly, it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma,

289
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
if not actually killed --

290
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
the beginning of the heyday of value-added food,

291
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
which contained as many soy and corn products

292
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
as could be crammed into it.

293
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Think of the frozen chicken nugget.

294
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
The chicken is fed corn, and then its meat is ground up,

295
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder,

296
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and then it's fried in corn oil.

297
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
All you do is nuke it. What could be better?

298
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And zapped horribly, pathetically.

299
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
By the '70s, home cooking was in such a sad state

300
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
that the high fat and spice contents of foods

301
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
like McNuggets and Hot Pockets --

302
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and we all have our favorites, actually --

303
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
made this stuff more appealing than the bland things

304
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that people were serving at home.

305
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
At the same time, masses of women were entering the workforce,

306
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and cooking simply wasn't important enough

307
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
for men to share the burden.

308
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
So now, you've got your pizza nights, you've got your microwave nights,

309
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
you've got your grazing nights,

310
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
you've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on.

311
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Leading the way -- what's leading the way?

312
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Meat, junk food, cheese:

313
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
the very stuff that will kill you.

314
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
So, now we clamor for organic food.

315
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
That's good.

316
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
And as evidence that things can actually change,

317
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
you can now find organic food in supermarkets,

318
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and even in fast-food outlets.

319
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
But organic food isn't the answer either,

320
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
at least not the way it's currently defined.

321
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Let me pose you a question.

322
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Can farm-raised salmon be organic,

323
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet,

324
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
even if the feed itself is supposedly organic, and the fish themselves

325
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
are packed tightly in pens, swimming in their own filth?

326
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And if that salmon's from Chile, and it's killed down there

327
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and then flown 5,000 miles, whatever,

328
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere?

329
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
I don't know.

330
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Packed in Styrofoam, of course,

331
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
before landing somewhere in the United States,

332
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and then being trucked a few hundred more miles.

333
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
This may be organic in letter, but it's surely not organic in spirit.

334
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Now here is where we all meet.

335
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
The locavores, the organivores, the vegetarians,

336
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
the vegans, the gourmets

337
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and those of us who are just plain interested in good food.

338
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Even though we've come to this from different points,

339
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
we all have to act on our knowledge

340
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
to change the way that everyone thinks about food.

341
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
We need to start acting.

342
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And this is not only an issue of social justice, as Ann Cooper said --

343
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and, of course, she's completely right --

344
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
but it's also one of global survival.

345
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue,

346
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food.

347
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
As I said, 18 percent of greenhouse gases

348
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
are attributed to livestock production.

349
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
How much livestock do you need to produce this?

350
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth,

351
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
30 percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted

352
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
to raising the animals we'll eat.

353
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
And this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so.

354
0:16:55.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
And if the numbers coming in from China

355
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
are anything like what they look like now,

356
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
it's not going to be 40 years.

357
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
There is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do.

358
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life.

359
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
The most common argument is that we need nutrients --

360
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
even though we eat, on average, twice as much protein

361
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
as even the industry-obsessed USDA recommends.

362
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
But listen: experts who are serious about disease reduction

363
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week.

364
0:17:32.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
What do you think we eat per day? Half a pound.

365
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:39,000
But don't we need meat to be big and strong?

366
0:17:39.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Isn't meat eating essential to health?

367
0:17:42.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Won't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables

368
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
turn us into godless, sissy, liberals?

369
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
(Laughter)

370
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:51,000
Some of us might think that would be a good thing.

371
0:17:51.16,000 --> 0:17:56,000
But, no, even if we were all steroid-filled football players,

372
0:17:56.16,000 --> 0:17:58,000
the answer is no.

373
0:17:58.16,000 --> 0:18:02,000
In fact, there's no diet on Earth that meets

374
0:18:02.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
basic nutritional needs that won't promote growth,

375
0:18:06.16,000 --> 0:18:09,000
and many will make you much healthier than ours does.

376
0:18:09.16,000 --> 0:18:12,000
We don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition,

377
0:18:12.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition, and it's killing us.

378
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:21,000
To suggest that in the interests of personal and human health

379
0:18:21.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
Americans eat 50 percent less meat --

380
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
it's not enough of a cut, but it's a start.

381
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:32,000
It would seem absurd, but that's exactly what should happen,

382
0:18:32.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
and what progressive people, forward-thinking people

383
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
should be doing and advocating,

384
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants.

385
0:18:42.16,000 --> 0:18:45,000
I've been writing about food more or less omnivorously --

386
0:18:45.16,000 --> 0:18:48,000
one might say indiscriminately -- for about 30 years.

387
0:18:48.16,000 --> 0:18:5,000
During that time, I've eaten

388
0:18:50.16,000 --> 0:18:53,000
and recommended eating just about everything.

389
0:18:54.16,000 --> 0:18:56,000
I'll never stop eating animals, I'm sure,

390
0:18:57.16,000 --> 0:18:59,000
but I do think that for the benefit of everyone,

391
0:18:59.16,000 --> 0:19:02,000
the time has come to stop raising them industrially

392
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:04,000
and stop eating them thoughtlessly.

393
0:19:04.16,000 --> 0:19:06,000
Ann Cooper's right.

394
0:19:06.16,000 --> 0:19:11,000
The USDA is not our ally here.

395
0:19:11.16,000 --> 0:19:13,000
We have to take matters into our own hands,

396
0:19:13.16,000 --> 0:19:16,000
not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone --

397
0:19:16.16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
and that's the hard part -- but by improving our own.

398
0:19:20.16,000 --> 0:19:22,000
And that happens to be quite easy.

399
0:19:22.16,000 --> 0:19:25,000
Less meat, less junk, more plants.

400
0:19:25.16,000 --> 0:19:27,000
It's a simple formula: eat food.

401
0:19:27.16,000 --> 0:19:29,000
Eat real food.

402
0:19:29.16,000 --> 0:19:33,000
We can continue to enjoy our food, and we continue to eat well,

403
0:19:33.16,000 --> 0:19:35,000
and we can eat even better.

404
0:19:35.16,000 --> 0:19:38,000
We can continue the search for the ingredients we love,

405
0:19:38.16,000 --> 0:19:43,000
and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals.

406
0:19:43.16,000 --> 0:19:47,000
We'll reduce not only calories, but our carbon footprint.

407
0:19:47.16,000 --> 0:19:5,000
We can make food more important, not less,

408
0:19:50.16,000 --> 0:19:52,000
and save ourselves by doing so.

409
0:19:52.16,000 --> 0:19:55,000
We have to choose that path.

410
0:19:55.16,000 --> 0:19:57,000
Thank you.

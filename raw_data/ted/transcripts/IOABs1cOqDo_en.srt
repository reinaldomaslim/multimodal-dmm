[This talk contains mature language Viewer discretion is advised]

2
0:00:15.88,000 --> 0:00:19,000
If we traveled back to the year 800 BC,

3
0:00:20.6,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in Greece, we would see that merchants whose businesses failed

4
0:00:24.44,000 --> 0:00:28,000
were forced to sit in the marketplace with a basket over their heads.

5
0:00:29.8,000 --> 0:00:3,000
In premodern Italy,

6
0:00:31.6,000 --> 0:00:34,000
failed business owners, who had outstanding debts,

7
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:38,000
were taken totally naked to the public square

8
0:00:38.8,000 --> 0:00:41,000
where they had to bang their butts against a special stone

9
0:00:42.48,000 --> 0:00:44,000
while a crowd jeered at them.

10
0:00:45.96,000 --> 0:00:47,000
In the 17th century in France,

11
0:00:48.84,000 --> 0:00:51,000
failed business owners were taken to the center of the market,

12
0:00:52.68,000 --> 0:00:55,000
where the beginning of their bankruptcy was publicly announced.

13
0:00:56.44,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And in order to avoid immediate imprisonment,

14
0:00:59.72,000 --> 0:01:01,000
they had to wear a green bonnet

15
0:01:01.8,000 --> 0:01:04,000
so that everyone knew they were a failure.

16
0:01:05.84,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Of course, these are extreme examples.

17
0:01:09.24,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But it is important to remember

18
0:01:11.32,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that when we excessively punish those who fail,

19
0:01:14.68,000 --> 0:01:17,000
we stifle innovation and business creation,

20
0:01:17.84,000 --> 0:01:2,000
the engines of economic growth in any country.

21
0:01:22.48,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Time has passed, and today we don't publicly humiliate failed entrepreneurs.

22
0:01:28.24,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And they don't broadcast their failures on social media.

23
0:01:32.2,000 --> 0:01:37,000
In fact, I think that all of us can relate with the pain of failure.

24
0:01:37.68,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But we don't share the details of those experiences.

25
0:01:41.12,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And I totally get it, my friends, I have also been there.

26
0:01:45.48,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I had a business that failed

27
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and sharing that story was incredibly hard.

28
0:01:50.92,000 --> 0:01:55,000
In fact, it required seven years, a good dose of vulnerability

29
0:01:56.32,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and the company of my friends.

30
0:01:58.96,000 --> 0:01:59,000
This is my failure story.

31
0:02:01.44,000 --> 0:02:05,000
When I was in college, studying business, I met a group of indigenous women.

32
0:02:06.4,000 --> 0:02:11,000
They lived in a poor rural community in the state of Puebla, in central Mexico.

33
0:02:11.8,000 --> 0:02:14,000
They made beautiful handmade products.

34
0:02:15.12,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And when I met them and I saw their work,

35
0:02:18.08,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I decided I wanted to help.

36
0:02:20.84,000 --> 0:02:23,000
With some friends, I cofounded a social enterprise

37
0:02:24.2,000 --> 0:02:27,000
with the mission to help the women create an income stream

38
0:02:28.04,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and improve their quality of life.

39
0:02:31.08,000 --> 0:02:33,000
We did everything by the book,

40
0:02:33.88,000 --> 0:02:35,000
as we had learned in business school.

41
0:02:36.52,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We got investors,

42
0:02:37.96,000 --> 0:02:42,000
we spent a lot of time building the business and training the women.

43
0:02:43.64,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But soon we realized we were novices.

44
0:02:47.44,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The handmade products were not selling,

45
0:02:50.72,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and the financial plan we had made was totally unrealistic.

46
0:02:55.44,000 --> 0:02:59,000
In fact, we worked for years without a salary,

47
0:02:59.72,000 --> 0:03:01,000
hoping that a miracle would happen,

48
0:03:02.08,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that magically a great buyer would arrive

49
0:03:04.8,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and she would make the business profitable.

50
0:03:07.92,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But that miracle never happened.

51
0:03:10.92,000 --> 0:03:12,000
In the end, we had to close the business,

52
0:03:13.76,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and that broke my heart.

53
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I started everything to create a positive impact

54
0:03:20.32,000 --> 0:03:22,000
on the life of the artisans.

55
0:03:22.44,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And I felt that I have done the opposite.

56
0:03:25.72,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I felt so guilty

57
0:03:28.12,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that I decided to hide this failure

58
0:03:30.44,000 --> 0:03:34,000
from my conversations and my resume for years.

59
0:03:34.92,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I didn't know other failed entrepreneurs,

60
0:03:37.4,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and I thought I was the only loser in the world.

61
0:03:42.32,000 --> 0:03:46,000
One night, seven years later, I was out with some friends

62
0:03:46.8,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and we were talking about the life of the entrepreneur.

63
0:03:50.32,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And of course, the issue of failure came out.

64
0:03:54.28,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I decided to confess to my friends the story of my failed business.

65
0:03:58.92,000 --> 0:04:,000
And they shared similar stories.

66
0:04:01.68,000 --> 0:04:06,000
In that moment, a thought became really clear in my mind:

67
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:09,000
all of my friends were failures.

68
0:04:09.24,000 --> 0:04:11,000
(Laughter)

69
0:04:11.32,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Being more serious, that night I realized

70
0:04:14.36,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that A: I wasn't the only loser in the world,

71
0:04:18.48,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and B: we all have hidden failures.

72
0:04:22.52,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Please tell me if that is not true.

73
0:04:26.32,000 --> 0:04:29,000
That night was like an exorcism for me.

74
0:04:29.88,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I realized that sharing your failures makes you stronger, not weaker.

75
0:04:35.44,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And being open to my vulnerability

76
0:04:37.8,000 --> 0:04:41,000
helped me connect with others in a deeper and more meaningful way

77
0:04:42.2,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and embrace life lessons I wouldn't have learned previously.

78
0:04:47.2,000 --> 0:04:49,000
As a consequence of this experience

79
0:04:49.32,000 --> 0:04:52,000
of sharing stories of businesses that didn't work,

80
0:04:52.68,000 --> 0:04:54,000
we decided to create a platform of events

81
0:04:55.12,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to help others share their failure stories.

82
0:04:58.2,000 --> 0:05:,000
And we called it Fuckup Nights.

83
0:05:01.56,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Years later, we also created a research center

84
0:05:05.12,000 --> 0:05:06,000
devoted to the story of failure

85
0:05:06.96,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and its implications on business, people and society

86
0:05:10.96,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and as we love cool names, we called it the Failure Institute.

87
0:05:16.84,000 --> 0:05:18,000
It has been surprising to see

88
0:05:19.52,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that when an entrepreneur stands on a stage

89
0:05:22.36,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and shares a story of failure,

90
0:05:24.32,000 --> 0:05:27,000
she can actually enjoy that experience.

91
0:05:27.52,000 --> 0:05:31,000
It doesn't have to be a moment of shame and embarrassment,

92
0:05:31.56,000 --> 0:05:33,000
as it used to be in the past.

93
0:05:33.76,000 --> 0:05:35,000
It is an opportunity to share lessons learned

94
0:05:36.28,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and build empathy.

95
0:05:38.08,000 --> 0:05:39,000
We have also discovered

96
0:05:39.6,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that when the members of a team share their failures, magic happens.

97
0:05:44.72,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Bonds grow stronger and collaboration becomes easier.

98
0:05:49.6,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Through our events and research projects,

99
0:05:51.96,000 --> 0:05:53,000
we have found some interesting facts.

100
0:05:54.64,000 --> 0:05:58,000
For instance, that men and women react in a different way

101
0:05:58.92,000 --> 0:06:,000
after the failure of a business.

102
0:06:01.36,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The most common reaction among men

103
0:06:04.28,000 --> 0:06:07,000
is to start a new business within one year of failure,

104
0:06:08.12,000 --> 0:06:1,000
but in a different sector,

105
0:06:10.28,000 --> 0:06:12,000
while women decide to look for a job

106
0:06:13.08,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and postpone the creation of a new business.

107
0:06:16.2,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Our hypothesis is that this happens

108
0:06:18.52,000 --> 0:06:22,000
because women tend to suffer more from the impostor syndrome.

109
0:06:22.84,000 --> 0:06:26,000
We feel that we need something else to be a good entrepreneur.

110
0:06:27.84,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But I have seen that in many, many cases women have everything that's needed.

111
0:06:33.68,000 --> 0:06:35,000
We just need to take the step.

112
0:06:36.64,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And in the case of men,

113
0:06:38.24,000 --> 0:06:42,000
it is more common to see that they feel they have enough knowledge

114
0:06:42.52,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and just need to put it in practice in another place with better luck.

115
0:06:47.92,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Another interesting finding has been

116
0:06:50.44,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that there are regional differences on how entrepreneurs cope with failure.

117
0:06:55.72,000 --> 0:06:57,000
For instance, the most common reaction

118
0:06:58.12,000 --> 0:07:01,000
after the failure of a business in the American continent

119
0:07:01.48,000 --> 0:07:03,000
is to go back to school.

120
0:07:03.68,000 --> 0:07:07,000
While in Europe, the most common reaction is to look for a therapist.

121
0:07:08.28,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Laughter)

122
0:07:10.92,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We're not sure which is a better reaction after the failure of a business,

123
0:07:14.96,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but this is something we will study in the future.

124
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Another interesting finding has been

125
0:07:23.12,000 --> 0:07:28,000
the profound impact that public policy has on failed entrepreneurs.

126
0:07:28.8,000 --> 0:07:3,000
For instance, in my country, in Mexico,

127
0:07:31.32,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the regulatory environment is so hard,

128
0:07:34.64,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that closing a business can take you a lot of time and a lot of money.

129
0:07:39.68,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Let's begin with the money.

130
0:07:42.4,000 --> 0:07:43,000
In the best possible scenario,

131
0:07:44.36,000 --> 0:07:46,000
meaning you don't have problems with partners,

132
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:49,000
providers, clients, employees,

133
0:07:49.72,000 --> 0:07:51,000
in the best possible scenario,

134
0:07:51.8,000 --> 0:07:55,000
officially closing a business will cost you 2,000 dollars.

135
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Which is a lot of money in Mexico.

136
0:07:58.12,000 --> 0:08:,000
Someone who earns the minimum wage

137
0:08:00.36,000 --> 0:08:03,000
would have to work for 15 months to save this amount.

138
0:08:04.56,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Now, let's talk about the time.

139
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
As you may know, in most of the developing world,

140
0:08:10.4,000 --> 0:08:14,000
the average life expectancy of a business is two years.

141
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
In Mexico, the process of officially closing a business takes two years.

142
0:08:21.72,000 --> 0:08:24,000
What happens when the average life expectancy of a business

143
0:08:25.4,000 --> 0:08:3,000
is so similar to the time it will take you to close it if it doesn't work?

144
0:08:31.12,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Of course, this discourages business creation

145
0:08:34.2,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and promotes informal economy.

146
0:08:36.84,000 --> 0:08:38,000
In fact, econometric research has proved

147
0:08:39.44,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that if the process of declaring bankruptcy takes less time and less money,

148
0:08:44.96,000 --> 0:08:46,000
more new firms will enter the market.

149
0:08:48.48,000 --> 0:08:5,000
For this reason, in 2017,

150
0:08:51.36,000 --> 0:08:54,000
we proposed a series of public policy recommendations

151
0:08:54.799,000 --> 0:08:58,000
for the procedure of officially closing businesses in Mexico.

152
0:08:59.12,000 --> 0:09:,000
For a whole year,

153
0:09:00.8,000 --> 0:09:03,000
we worked with entrepreneurs from all over the country

154
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and with Congress.

155
0:09:05.64,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And the good news is that we managed to help change the law.

156
0:09:10.24,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Yay!

157
0:09:11.48,000 --> 0:09:14,000
(Applause)

158
0:09:14.52,000 --> 0:09:17,000
The idea is that when the new regulation comes into force,

159
0:09:18.24,000 --> 0:09:23,000
entrepreneurs will be able to close their businesses in an online procedure

160
0:09:23.36,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that is faster and inexpensive.

161
0:09:26.76,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Sighs)

162
0:09:28.64,000 --> 0:09:3,000
On the night we invented Fuckup Nights,

163
0:09:30.88,000 --> 0:09:34,000
we never imagined that the movement would grow this big.

164
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We are in 80 countries now.

165
0:09:38.76,000 --> 0:09:4,000
In that moment, our only intention

166
0:09:41.56,000 --> 0:09:44,000
was to put the topic of failure on the table.

167
0:09:44.96,000 --> 0:09:47,000
To help our friends see that failure is something we must talk about.

168
0:09:48.68,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It is not a cause of humiliation, as it used to be in the past,

169
0:09:53.32,000 --> 0:09:55,000
or a cause of celebration, as some people say.

170
0:09:56.92,000 --> 0:09:58,000
In fact, I want to confess something.

171
0:10:00.76,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Every time I listen to Silicon Valley types or students

172
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:1,000
bragging about failing fast and often like it's no big deal, I cringe.

173
0:10:11.48,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Because I think that there is a dark side on the mantra "fail fast."

174
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Of course, failing fast is a great way to accelerate learning

175
0:10:21.36,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and avoid wasting time.

176
0:10:23.24,000 --> 0:10:26,000
But I fear that when we present rapid failure

177
0:10:26.8,000 --> 0:10:28,000
to entrepreneurs as their one and only option,

178
0:10:29.68,000 --> 0:10:31,000
we might be promoting laziness.

179
0:10:32.12,000 --> 0:10:35,000
We might be promoting that entrepreneurs give up too easily.

180
0:10:36.28,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I also fear that the culture of rapid failure

181
0:10:39.36,000 --> 0:10:42,000
could be minimizing the devastating consequences

182
0:10:43.2,000 --> 0:10:44,000
of the failure of a business.

183
0:10:45.6,000 --> 0:10:48,000
For instance, when my social enterprise died,

184
0:10:49.12,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the worst part was that I had to go back to the indigenous community

185
0:10:54.64,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and tell the women that the business had failed

186
0:10:57.64,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and it was my fault.

187
0:11:00.28,000 --> 0:11:04,000
For some people this could be seen like a great learning opportunity for me,

188
0:11:05.28,000 --> 0:11:08,000
but the truth is that the closure of this business

189
0:11:08.36,000 --> 0:11:1,000
represented much more than that.

190
0:11:11.52,000 --> 0:11:14,000
It meant that the women would stop receiving an income

191
0:11:14.88,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that they really needed.

192
0:11:17.72,000 --> 0:11:2,000
For this reason, I want to propose something.

193
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I want to propose that just as we put aside the idea

194
0:11:25.12,000 --> 0:11:28,000
of publicly humiliating failed entrepreneurs,

195
0:11:28.36,000 --> 0:11:33,000
we must put aside the idea that failing fast is always the best.

196
0:11:34.36,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And I want to propose a new mantra:

197
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
fail mindfully.

198
0:11:39.52,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We must remember that businesses are made of people,

199
0:11:43.44,000 --> 0:11:46,000
businesses are not entities that appear and disappear

200
0:11:46.84,000 --> 0:11:48,000
magically without consequences.

201
0:11:49.56,000 --> 0:11:52,000
When a firm dies, some people will lose their jobs.

202
0:11:52.88,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And others will lose their money.

203
0:11:55.28,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And in the case of social and green enterprises,

204
0:11:58.72,000 --> 0:12:02,000
the death of this business can have a negative impact

205
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:06,000
on the ecosystems or communities they were trying to serve.

206
0:12:07.36,000 --> 0:12:11,000
But what does it mean to fail mindfully?

207
0:12:11.48,000 --> 0:12:15,000
It means being aware of the impact, of the consequences

208
0:12:16.24,000 --> 0:12:17,000
of the failure of that business.

209
0:12:18.92,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Being aware of the lessons learned.

210
0:12:21.96,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And being aware of the responsibility

211
0:12:25.48,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to share those learnings with the world.

212
0:12:28.4,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Thank you.

213
0:12:29.64,000 --> 0:12:32,000
(Applause)

0:00:12.809,000 --> 0:00:13,000
A few years ago,

2
0:00:13.984,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I got one of those spam emails.

3
0:00:17.468,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And it managed to get through my spam filter.

4
0:00:19.596,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm not quite sure how, but it turned up in my inbox,

5
0:00:22.176,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and it was from a guy called Solomon Odonkoh.

6
0:00:24.349,000 --> 0:00:25,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:26.159,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I know.

8
0:00:27.334,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:28.588,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It went like this:

10
0:00:29.772,000 --> 0:00:3,000
it said, "Hello James Veitch,

11
0:00:31.414,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I have an interesting business proposal I want to share with you, Solomon."

12
0:00:36.246,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Now, my hand was kind of hovering on the delete button, right?

13
0:00:39.183,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I was looking at my phone. I thought, I could just delete this.

14
0:00:42.442,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Or I could do what I think we've all always wanted to do.

15
0:00:46.631,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:50.541,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And I said, "Solomon, Your email intrigues me."

17
0:00:52.774,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:55.5,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Applause)

19
0:01:00.5,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And the game was afoot.

20
0:01:05.214,000 --> 0:01:07,000
He said, "Dear James Veitch, We shall be shipping Gold to you."

21
0:01:08.199,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:10.302,000 --> 0:01:12,000
"You will earn 10% of any gold you distributes."

23
0:01:13.223,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:15.307,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So I knew I was dealing with a professional.

25
0:01:17.382,000 --> 0:01:2,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:22.408,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I said, "How much is it worth?"

27
0:01:25.058,000 --> 0:01:27,000
He said, "We will start with smaller quantity," --

28
0:01:27.582,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I was like, aww --

29
0:01:28.758,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and then he said, "of 25 kgs.

30
0:01:31.576,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:34.969,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The worth should be about $2.5 million."

32
0:01:39.536,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I said, "Solomon, if we're going to do it, let's go big.

33
0:01:42.235,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Applause)

34
0:01:50.286,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I can handle it. How much gold do you have?"

35
0:01:54.215,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:57.761,000 --> 0:01:59,000
He said, "It is not a matter of how much gold I have,

37
0:02:00.385,000 --> 0:02:02,000
what matters is your capability of handling.

38
0:02:02.46,000 --> 0:02:04,000
We can start with 50 kgs as trial shipment."

39
0:02:04.707,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I said, "50 kgs?

40
0:02:06.602,000 --> 0:02:07,000
There's no point doing this at all

41
0:02:08.269,000 --> 0:02:1,000
unless you're shipping at least a metric ton."

42
0:02:10.523,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:11.742,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Applause)

44
0:02:15.401,000 --> 0:02:16,000
He said, "What do you do for a living?"

45
0:02:17.348,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:20.283,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I said, "I'm a hedge fund executive bank manager."

47
0:02:22.649,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:27.243,000 --> 0:02:29,000
This isn't the first time I've shipped bullion, my friend,

49
0:02:29.993,000 --> 0:02:3,000
no no no.

50
0:02:32.989,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Then I started to panic.

51
0:02:34.164,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I was like, "Where are you based?"

52
0:02:35.816,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I don't know about you,

53
0:02:37.022,000 --> 0:02:39,000
but I think if we're going via the postal service,

54
0:02:39.414,000 --> 0:02:4,000
it ought to be signed for.

55
0:02:40.746,000 --> 0:02:41,000
That's a lot of gold."

56
0:02:42.666,000 --> 0:02:44,000
He said, "It will not be easy to convince my company

57
0:02:45.127,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to do larger quantity shipment."

58
0:02:46.861,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I said, "Solomon, I'm completely with you on this one.

59
0:02:49.413,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I'm putting together a visual for you to take into the board meeting.

60
0:02:52.883,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Hold tight."

61
0:02:54.087,000 --> 0:02:57,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:01.009,000 --> 0:03:02,000
This is what I sent Solomon.

63
0:03:03.205,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:05.356,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Applause)

65
0:03:11.829,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I don't know if we have any statisticians in the house,

66
0:03:14.908,000 --> 0:03:16,000
but there's definitely something going on.

67
0:03:16.941,000 --> 0:03:17,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:19.17,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I said, "Solomon, attached to this email you'll find a helpful chart.

69
0:03:23.281,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I've had one of my assistants run the numbers.

70
0:03:25.598,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:27.408,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We're ready for shipping as much gold as possible."

72
0:03:30.254,000 --> 0:03:33,000
There's always a moment where they try to tug your heartstrings,

73
0:03:33.329,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and this was it for Solomon.

74
0:03:34.695,000 --> 0:03:36,000
He said, "I will be so much happy if the deal goes well,

75
0:03:37.346,000 --> 0:03:39,000
because I'm going to get a very good commission as well."

76
0:03:40.045,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And I said, "That's amazing, What are you going to spend your cut on?"

77
0:03:43.363,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And he said, "On RealEstate, what about you?"

78
0:03:46.133,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I thought about it for a long time.

79
0:03:50.925,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And I said, "One word;

80
0:03:53.632,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Hummus."

81
0:03:54.807,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:00.261,000 --> 0:04:01,000
"It's going places.

83
0:04:01.435,000 --> 0:04:02,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:03.395,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I was in Sainsbury's the other day

85
0:04:05.065,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and there were like 30 different varieties.

86
0:04:07.142,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Also you can cut up carrots, and you can dip them.

87
0:04:10.063,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Have you ever done that, Solomon?"

88
0:04:11.943,000 --> 0:04:13,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:14.458,000 --> 0:04:15,000
He said, "I have to go bed now."

90
0:04:16.014,000 --> 0:04:18,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:18.917,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Applause)

92
0:04:21.8,000 --> 0:04:22,000
"Till morrow.

93
0:04:24.407,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Have sweet dream."

94
0:04:25.583,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I didn't know what to say!

95
0:04:27.643,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I said, "Bonsoir my golden nugget, bonsoir."

96
0:04:30.554,000 --> 0:04:32,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:33.323,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Guys, you have to understand, this had been going for, like, weeks,

98
0:04:36.499,000 --> 0:04:38,000
albeit hitherto the greatest weeks of my life,

99
0:04:38.674,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but I had to knock it on the head.

100
0:04:40.325,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It was getting a bit out of hand.

101
0:04:41.929,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Friends were saying, "James, do you want to come for a drink?"

102
0:04:44.905,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I was like, "I can't, I'm expecting an email about some gold."

103
0:04:47.945,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So I figured I had to knock it on the head.

104
0:04:50.013,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I had to take it to a ridiculous conclusion.

105
0:04:52.093,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So I concocted a plan.

106
0:04:53.269,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I said, "Solomon, I'm concerned about security.

107
0:04:55.645,000 --> 0:04:56,000
When we email each other,

108
0:04:56.876,000 --> 0:04:57,000
we need to use a code."

109
0:05:00.582,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And he agreed.

110
0:05:01.757,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

111
0:05:03.169,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I said, "Solomon, I spent all night coming up with this code

112
0:05:06.082,000 --> 0:05:08,000
we need to use in all further correspondence:

113
0:05:08.211,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Lawyer: Gummy Bear.

114
0:05:13.564,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Bank: Cream Egg.

115
0:05:16.002,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Legal: Fizzy Cola Bottle. Claim: Peanut M&Ms.

116
0:05:18.193,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Documents: Jelly Beans.

117
0:05:20.137,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Western Union: A Giant Gummy Lizard."

118
0:05:22.305,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Laughter)

119
0:05:24.602,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I knew these were all words they use, right?

120
0:05:26.962,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I said, "Please call me Kitkat in all further correspondence."

121
0:05:30.661,000 --> 0:05:34,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:36.002,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I didn't hear back. I thought, I've gone too far.

123
0:05:38.454,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I've gone too far. So I had to backpedal a little.

124
0:05:40.82,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I said, "Solomon, Is the deal still on?

125
0:05:44.311,000 --> 0:05:45,000
KitKat."

126
0:05:45.486,000 --> 0:05:46,000
(Laughter)

127
0:05:46.756,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Because you have to be consistent.

128
0:05:51.208,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Then I did get an email back from him.

129
0:05:53.098,000 --> 0:05:56,000
He said, "The Business is on and I am trying to blah blah blah ..."

130
0:05:56.302,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I said, "Dude, you have to use the code!"

131
0:06:01.478,000 --> 0:06:03,000
What followed is the greatest email I've ever received.

132
0:06:04.09,000 --> 0:06:06,000
(Laughter)

133
0:06:07.675,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I'm not joking, this is what turned up in my inbox.

134
0:06:10.939,000 --> 0:06:11,000
This was a good day.

135
0:06:13.224,000 --> 0:06:14,000
"The business is on.

136
0:06:16.065,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I am trying to raise the balance for the Gummy Bear --

137
0:06:18.708,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Laughter)

138
0:06:23.485,000 --> 0:06:26,000
so he can submit all the needed Fizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans

139
0:06:26.734,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to the Creme Egg,

140
0:06:29.791,000 --> 0:06:31,000
for the Peanut M&Ms process to start.

141
0:06:32.118,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Laughter)

142
0:06:33.94,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Send 1,500 pounds

143
0:06:36.093,000 --> 0:06:38,000
via a Giant Gummy Lizard."

144
0:06:38.506,000 --> 0:06:44,000
(Applause)

145
0:06:49.392,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And that was so much fun, right,

146
0:06:51.821,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that it got me thinking:

147
0:06:53.195,000 --> 0:06:55,000
like, what would happen if I just spent as much time as could

148
0:06:56.13,000 --> 0:06:58,000
replying to as many scam emails as I could?

149
0:07:00.145,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And that's what I've been doing

150
0:07:03.145,000 --> 0:07:05,000
for three years

151
0:07:05.269,000 --> 0:07:06,000
on your behalf.

152
0:07:06.574,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Laughter)

153
0:07:08.993,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Applause)

154
0:07:12.079,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Crazy stuff happens when you start replying to scam emails.

155
0:07:14.974,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It's really difficult,

156
0:07:16.149,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and I highly recommend we do it.

157
0:07:17.751,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I don't think what I'm doing is mean.

158
0:07:19.616,000 --> 0:07:21,000
There are a lot of people who do mean things to scammers.

159
0:07:22.392,000 --> 0:07:25,000
All I'm doing is wasting their time.

160
0:07:26.894,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And I think any time they're spending with me

161
0:07:29.077,000 --> 0:07:31,000
is time they're not spending scamming vulnerable adults

162
0:07:31.698,000 --> 0:07:32,000
out of their savings, right?

163
0:07:33.584,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And if you're going to do this -- and I highly recommend you do --

164
0:07:37.171,000 --> 0:07:39,000
get yourself a pseudonymous email address.

165
0:07:39.206,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Don't use your own email address.

166
0:07:40.834,000 --> 0:07:42,000
That's what I was doing at the start and it was a nightmare.

167
0:07:43.712,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I'd wake up in the morning and have a thousand emails

168
0:07:46.292,000 --> 0:07:47,000
about penis enlargements,

169
0:07:47.523,000 --> 0:07:49,000
only one of which was a legitimate response --

170
0:07:49.744,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Laughter)

171
0:07:51.864,000 --> 0:07:52,000
to a medical question I had.

172
0:07:53.23,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But I'll tell you what, though, guys,

173
0:07:55.023,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I'll tell you what: any day is a good day, any day is a good day

174
0:07:58.048,000 --> 0:08:,000
if you receive an email that begins like this:

175
0:08:01.558,000 --> 0:08:03,000
(Laughter)

176
0:08:04.396,000 --> 0:08:05,000
"I AM WINNIE MANDELA,

177
0:08:07.094,000 --> 0:08:1,000
THE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT."

178
0:08:10.412,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I was like, oh! -- that Winnie Mandela.

179
0:08:12.339,000 --> 0:08:13,000
(Laughter)

180
0:08:13.444,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I know so many.

181
0:08:15.546,000 --> 0:08:18,000
"I NEED TO TRANSFER 45 MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE COUNTRY

182
0:08:18.626,000 --> 0:08:2,000
BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND NELSON MANDELA'S HEALTH CONDITION."

183
0:08:21.42,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Let that sink in.

184
0:08:23.864,000 --> 0:08:25,000
She sent me this, which is hysterical.

185
0:08:26.528,000 --> 0:08:28,000
(Laughter)

186
0:08:29.499,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And this.

187
0:08:30.682,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And this looks fairly legitimate, this is a letter of authorization.

188
0:08:33.905,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But to be honest, if there's nothing written on it, it's just a shape!

189
0:08:37.318,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Laughter)

190
0:08:39.651,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I said, "Winnie, I'm really sorry to hear of this.

191
0:08:42.017,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Given that Nelson died three months ago,

192
0:08:44.034,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I'd describe his health condition as fairly serious."

193
0:08:46.644,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Laughter)

194
0:08:49.482,000 --> 0:08:52,000
That's the worst health condition you can have, not being alive.

195
0:08:55.373,000 --> 0:08:57,000
She said, "KINDLY COMPLY WITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS.

196
0:08:58.168,000 --> 0:08:59,000
ONE LOVE."

197
0:08:59.35,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Laughter)

198
0:09:02.325,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I said, "Of course. NO WOMAN, NO CRY."

199
0:09:04.167,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Laughter)

200
0:09:07.695,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Applause)

201
0:09:12.701,000 --> 0:09:15,000
She said, "MY BANKER WILL NEED TRANSFER OF 3000 DOLLARS. ONE LOVE."

202
0:09:15.876,000 --> 0:09:17,000
(Laughter)

203
0:09:20.01,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I said, "no problemo.

204
0:09:24.422,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I SHOT THE SHERIFF."

205
0:09:29.813,000 --> 0:09:3,000
[ (BUT I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEPUTY) ]

206
0:09:31.717,000 --> 0:09:32,000
(Laughter)

207
0:09:32.766,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Thank you.

208
0:09:33.942,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Applause)

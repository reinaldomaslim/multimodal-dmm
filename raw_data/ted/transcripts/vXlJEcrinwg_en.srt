1
0:00:12.944,000 --> 0:00:16,000
There are two powerful phenomena unfolding on earth:

2
0:00:18.111,000 --> 0:00:2,000
the rise of global warming

3
0:00:20.313,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and the rise of women and girls.

4
0:00:23.69,000 --> 0:00:26,000
The link between them is often overlooked,

5
0:00:26.998,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but gender equity is a key answer to our planetary challenge.

6
0:00:32.486,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Let me explain.

7
0:00:34.857,000 --> 0:00:35,000
For the last few years,

8
0:00:36.12,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I have been working on an effort called "Project Drawdown."

9
0:00:40.323,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Our team has scoured humanity's wisdom

10
0:00:43.325,000 --> 0:00:48,000
for solutions to draw down heat-trapping, climate-changing emissions

11
0:00:49.341,000 --> 0:00:5,000
in the atmosphere --

12
0:00:51.127,000 --> 0:00:55,000
not "someday, maybe, if we're lucky" solutions,

13
0:00:55.236,000 --> 0:00:58,000
the 80 best practices and technologies

14
0:00:58.794,000 --> 0:01:,000
already in hand:

15
0:01:00.873,000 --> 0:01:04,000
clean, renewable energy, including solar and wind;

16
0:01:06.609,000 --> 0:01:09,000
green buildings, both new and retrofitted;

17
0:01:11.542,000 --> 0:01:14,000
efficient transportation from Brazil to China;

18
0:01:15.902,000 --> 0:01:2,000
thriving ecosystems through protection and restoration;

19
0:01:21.506,000 --> 0:01:25,000
reducing waste and reclaiming its value;

20
0:01:25.896,000 --> 0:01:29,000
growing food in good ways that regenerates soil;

21
0:01:31.066,000 --> 0:01:35,000
shifting diets to less meat, more plants;

22
0:01:36.426,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and equity for women and girls.

23
0:01:40.524,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Gender and climate are inextricably linked.

24
0:01:44.881,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Drawing down emissions depends on rising up.

25
0:01:50.98,000 --> 0:01:51,000
First, a bit of context.

26
0:01:53.492,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We are in a situation of urgency, severity and scope

27
0:01:57.943,000 --> 0:01:59,000
never before faced by humankind.

28
0:02:01.249,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So far, our response isn't anywhere close to adequate.

29
0:02:07.762,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But you already know that.

30
0:02:10.155,000 --> 0:02:12,000
You know it in your gut,

31
0:02:12.533,000 --> 0:02:13,000
in your bones.

32
0:02:15.117,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We are each part of the planet's living systems,

33
0:02:18.27,000 --> 0:02:23,000
knitted together with almost 7.7 billion human beings

34
0:02:23.529,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and 1.8 million known species.

35
0:02:27.84,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We can feel the connections between us.

36
0:02:31.712,000 --> 0:02:33,000
We can feel the brokenness

37
0:02:33.82,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and the closing window to heal it.

38
0:02:37.028,000 --> 0:02:39,000
This earth, our home,

39
0:02:40.615,000 --> 0:02:44,000
is telling us that a better way of being must emerge, and fast.

40
0:02:47.504,000 --> 0:02:49,000
In my experience, to have eyes wide open

41
0:02:50.511,000 --> 0:02:52,000
is to hold a broken heart every day.

42
0:02:53.617,000 --> 0:02:55,000
It's a grief that I rarely speak,

43
0:02:56.758,000 --> 0:02:59,000
though my work calls on the power of voice.

44
0:03:02.256,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I remind myself that the heart can simply break, or it can break open.

45
0:03:08.672,000 --> 0:03:13,000
A broken-open heart is awake and alive and calls for action.

46
0:03:14.782,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It is regenerative, like nature,

47
0:03:18.562,000 --> 0:03:2,000
reclaiming ruined ground, growing anew.

48
0:03:22.351,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Life moves inexorably toward more life,

49
0:03:26.115,000 --> 0:03:27,000
toward healing,

50
0:03:27.747,000 --> 0:03:28,000
toward wholeness.

51
0:03:29.734,000 --> 0:03:31,000
That's a fundamental ecological truth.

52
0:03:33.001,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And we, all of us,

53
0:03:36.222,000 --> 0:03:37,000
we are life force.

54
0:03:39.849,000 --> 0:03:43,000
On the face of it, the primary link between women, girls and a warming world

55
0:03:44.073,000 --> 0:03:45,000
is not life but death.

56
0:03:46.813,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Awareness is growing that climate impacts hit women and girls hardest,

57
0:03:51.8,000 --> 0:03:53,000
given existing vulnerabilities.

58
0:03:54.569,000 --> 0:03:56,000
There is greater risk of displacement,

59
0:03:57.123,000 --> 0:04:,000
higher odds of being injured or killed during a natural disaster.

60
0:04:01.944,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Prolonged drought can precipitate early marriage

61
0:04:05.026,000 --> 0:04:07,000
as families contend with scarcity.

62
0:04:08.34,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Floods can force last-resort prostitution

63
0:04:11.496,000 --> 0:04:13,000
as women struggle to make ends meet.

64
0:04:14.029,000 --> 0:04:16,000
The list goes on and goes wide.

65
0:04:17.262,000 --> 0:04:2,000
These dynamics are most acute under conditions of poverty,

66
0:04:20.721,000 --> 0:04:22,000
from New Orleans to Nairobi.

67
0:04:24.907,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Too often, the story ends here.

68
0:04:27.193,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But not today.

69
0:04:29.177,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Another empowering truth begs to be seen.

70
0:04:32.228,000 --> 0:04:35,000
If we gain ground on gender equity,

71
0:04:35.524,000 --> 0:04:38,000
we also gain ground on addressing global warming.

72
0:04:40.268,000 --> 0:04:43,000
This connection comes to light in three key areas,

73
0:04:43.969,000 --> 0:04:47,000
three areas where we can secure the rights of women and girls,

74
0:04:48.136,000 --> 0:04:49,000
shore up resilience

75
0:04:49.766,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and avert emissions at the same time.

76
0:04:53.268,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Women are the primary farmers of the world.

77
0:04:57.449,000 --> 0:05:,000
They produce 60 to 80 percent of food in lower-income countries,

78
0:05:01.152,000 --> 0:05:04,000
often operating on fewer than five acres.

79
0:05:04.306,000 --> 0:05:06,000
That's what the term "smallholder" means.

80
0:05:07.705,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Compared with men, women smallholders have less access to resources,

81
0:05:12.825,000 --> 0:05:14,000
including land rights,

82
0:05:15.047,000 --> 0:05:17,000
credit and capital, training,

83
0:05:17.456,000 --> 0:05:18,000
tools and technology.

84
0:05:19.51,000 --> 0:05:21,000
They farm as capably and efficiently as men,

85
0:05:23.088,000 --> 0:05:26,000
but this well-documented disparity in resources and rights

86
0:05:26.842,000 --> 0:05:29,000
means women produce less food on the same amount of land.

87
0:05:31.439,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Close those gaps,

88
0:05:33.702,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and farm yields rise by 20 to 30 percent.

89
0:05:37.065,000 --> 0:05:42,000
That means 20 to 30 percent more food from the same garden or the same field.

90
0:05:43.857,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The implications for hunger, for health, for household income --

91
0:05:47.949,000 --> 0:05:48,000
they're obvious.

92
0:05:49.58,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Let's follow the thread to climate.

93
0:05:53.061,000 --> 0:05:55,000
We humans need land to grow food.

94
0:05:56.836,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Unfortunately, forests are often cleared to supply it,

95
0:06:00.207,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and that causes emissions from deforestation.

96
0:06:03.866,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But if existing farms produce enough food,

97
0:06:08.001,000 --> 0:06:1,000
forests are less likely to be lost.

98
0:06:10.274,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So there's a ripple effect.

99
0:06:12.755,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Support women smallholders,

100
0:06:14.972,000 --> 0:06:16,000
realize higher yields,

101
0:06:17.09,000 --> 0:06:18,000
avoid deforestation

102
0:06:18.736,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and sustain the life-giving power of forests.

103
0:06:22.949,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Project Drawdown estimates that addressing inequity in agriculture

104
0:06:26.58,000 --> 0:06:31,000
could prevent two billion tons of emissions between now and 2050.

105
0:06:32.445,000 --> 0:06:36,000
That's on par with the impact household recycling can have globally.

106
0:06:37.765,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Addressing this inequity can also help women cope

107
0:06:40.892,000 --> 0:06:42,000
with the challenges of growing food

108
0:06:43.337,000 --> 0:06:44,000
as the climate changes.

109
0:06:46.193,000 --> 0:06:48,000
There is life force in cultivation.

110
0:06:49.947,000 --> 0:06:5,000
At last count,

111
0:06:51.61,000 --> 0:06:56,000
130 million girls are still denied their basic right to attend school.

112
0:06:57.234,000 --> 0:07:,000
Gaps are greatest in secondary school classrooms.

113
0:07:00.979,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Too many girls are missing a vital foundation for life.

114
0:07:05.599,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Education means better health for women and their children,

115
0:07:09.989,000 --> 0:07:1,000
better financial security,

116
0:07:12.172,000 --> 0:07:15,000
greater agency at home and in society,

117
0:07:16.216,000 --> 0:07:19,000
more capacity to navigate a climate-changing world.

118
0:07:20.614,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Education can mean options, adaptability, strength.

119
0:07:26.177,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It can also mean lower emissions.

120
0:07:29.433,000 --> 0:07:3,000
For a variety of reasons,

121
0:07:31.042,000 --> 0:07:33,000
when we have more years of education,

122
0:07:33.903,000 --> 0:07:35,000
we typically choose to marry later

123
0:07:36.535,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and to have fewer children.

124
0:07:38.234,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So our families end up being smaller.

125
0:07:41.631,000 --> 0:07:46,000
What happens at the individual level adds up across the world and over time.

126
0:07:46.741,000 --> 0:07:48,000
One by one by one,

127
0:07:48.97,000 --> 0:07:53,000
the right to go to school impacts how many human beings live on this planet

128
0:07:54.294,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and impacts its living systems.

129
0:07:57.5,000 --> 0:07:59,000
That's not why girls should be educated.

130
0:08:00.991,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It's one meaningful outcome.

131
0:08:04.354,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Education is one side of a coin.

132
0:08:06.97,000 --> 0:08:07,000
The other is family planning:

133
0:08:09.505,000 --> 0:08:13,000
access to high-quality, voluntary reproductive health care.

134
0:08:15.169,000 --> 0:08:17,000
To have children by choice rather than chance

135
0:08:17.799,000 --> 0:08:19,000
is a matter of autonomy and dignity.

136
0:08:21.478,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Yet in the US,

137
0:08:24.239,000 --> 0:08:26,000
45 percent of pregnancies are unintended.

138
0:08:27.834,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Two hundred and fourteen million women in lower-income countries

139
0:08:31.236,000 --> 0:08:34,000
say they want to decide whether and when to become pregnant

140
0:08:34.583,000 --> 0:08:36,000
but aren't using contraception.

141
0:08:36.634,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Listening to women's needs,

142
0:08:38.496,000 --> 0:08:4,000
addressing those needs,

143
0:08:40.549,000 --> 0:08:42,000
advancing equity and well-being:

144
0:08:43.023,000 --> 0:08:46,000
those must be the aims of family planning, period.

145
0:08:47.096,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Curbing the growth of our human population

146
0:08:49.782,000 --> 0:08:51,000
is a side effect, though a potent one.

147
0:08:53.255,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It could dramatically reduce demand for food, transportation, electricity,

148
0:08:58.527,000 --> 0:09:,000
buildings, goods and all the rest,

149
0:09:01.435,000 --> 0:09:03,000
thereby reducing emissions.

150
0:09:04.17,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Close the gaps on access to education and family planning,

151
0:09:08.415,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and by mid-century, we may find one billion fewer people inhabiting earth

152
0:09:13.474,000 --> 0:09:14,000
than we would if we do nothing more.

153
0:09:16.45,000 --> 0:09:18,000
According to Project Drawdown,

154
0:09:18.579,000 --> 0:09:2,000
one billion fewer people could mean we avoid

155
0:09:21.369,000 --> 0:09:24,000
nearly 120 billion tons of emissions.

156
0:09:25.685,000 --> 0:09:26,000
At that level of impact,

157
0:09:27.386,000 --> 0:09:32,000
gender equity is a top solution to restore a climate fit for life.

158
0:09:33.651,000 --> 0:09:34,000
At that level of impact,

159
0:09:35.473,000 --> 0:09:38,000
gender equity is on par with wind turbines

160
0:09:39.094,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and solar panels and forests.

161
0:09:43.02,000 --> 0:09:45,000
There is life force in learning

162
0:09:45.394,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and life force in choice.

163
0:09:49.005,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Now, let me be clear:

164
0:09:50.518,000 --> 0:09:53,000
this does not mean women and girls are responsible for fixing everything.

165
0:09:54.406,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Laughter)

166
0:09:56.046,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Though we probably will.

167
0:09:57.915,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Laughter)

168
0:09:59.305,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Applause)

169
0:10:04.363,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Equity for women in agriculture, education and family planning:

170
0:10:09.511,000 --> 0:10:12,000
these are solutions within a system of drawdown solutions.

171
0:10:13.901,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Together, they comprise a blueprint of possibility.

172
0:10:18.419,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And let me be even clearer about this:

173
0:10:21.404,000 --> 0:10:26,000
population cannot be seen in isolation from production or consumption.

174
0:10:28.365,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Some segments of the human family cause exponentially greater harm,

175
0:10:33.131,000 --> 0:10:35,000
while others suffer outsized injustice.

176
0:10:37.044,000 --> 0:10:38,000
The most affluent --

177
0:10:39.089,000 --> 0:10:4,000
we are the most accountable.

178
0:10:41.465,000 --> 0:10:43,000
We have the most to do.

179
0:10:46.496,000 --> 0:10:49,000
The gender-climate connection extends beyond negative impacts

180
0:10:49.83,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and beyond powerful solutions.

181
0:10:52.438,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Women are vital voices and agents for change on this planet,

182
0:10:58.08,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and yet we're too often missing or even barred from the proverbial table.

183
0:11:03.883,000 --> 0:11:05,000
We're too often ignored or silenced when we speak.

184
0:11:06.736,000 --> 0:11:07,000
We are too often passed over

185
0:11:08.931,000 --> 0:11:1,000
when plans are laid or investments made.

186
0:11:12.526,000 --> 0:11:14,000
According to one analysis,

187
0:11:14.918,000 --> 0:11:17,000
just 0.2 percent of philanthropic funds

188
0:11:18.774,000 --> 0:11:2,000
go specifically towards women and the environment,

189
0:11:22.228,000 --> 0:11:25,000
merely 110 million dollars globally,

190
0:11:25.972,000 --> 0:11:3,000
the sum spent by one man on a single Basquiat painting last year.

191
0:11:32.911,000 --> 0:11:35,000
These dynamics are not only unjust, they are setting us up for failure.

192
0:11:37.49,000 --> 0:11:4,000
To rapidly, radically reshape society,

193
0:11:40.606,000 --> 0:11:42,000
we need every solution and every solver,

194
0:11:44.186,000 --> 0:11:45,000
every mind,

195
0:11:45.767,000 --> 0:11:46,000
every bit of heart,

196
0:11:47.365,000 --> 0:11:48,000
every set of hands.

197
0:11:49.84,000 --> 0:11:51,000
We often crave a simple call to action,

198
0:11:53.447,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but this challenge demands more than a fact sheet

199
0:11:56.674,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and more than a checklist.

200
0:11:58.978,000 --> 0:12:01,000
We need to function more like an ecosystem,

201
0:12:02.152,000 --> 0:12:04,000
finding strength in our diversity.

202
0:12:05.53,000 --> 0:12:07,000
You know what your superpowers are.

203
0:12:08.356,000 --> 0:12:14,000
You're an educator, farmer, healer, creator, campaigner, wisdom-keeper.

204
0:12:15.456,000 --> 0:12:18,000
How might you link arms where you are

205
0:12:18.757,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to move solutions forward?

206
0:12:21.532,000 --> 0:12:23,000
There is one role I want to ask that all of you play:

207
0:12:24.484,000 --> 0:12:25,000
the role of messenger.

208
0:12:27.341,000 --> 0:12:29,000
This is a time of great awakening.

209
0:12:30.507,000 --> 0:12:34,000
We need to break the silence around the condition of our planet;

210
0:12:35.524,000 --> 0:12:39,000
move beyond manufactured debates about climate science;

211
0:12:40.167,000 --> 0:12:41,000
share solutions;

212
0:12:43.038,000 --> 0:12:46,000
speak truth with a broken-open heart;

213
0:12:47.483,000 --> 0:12:52,000
teach that to address climate change, we must make gender equity a reality.

214
0:12:52.819,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And in the face of a seemingly impossible challenge,

215
0:12:56.524,000 --> 0:12:59,000
women and girls are a fierce source of possibility.

216
0:13:02.307,000 --> 0:13:04,000
It is a magnificent thing to be alive

217
0:13:05.845,000 --> 0:13:07,000
in a moment that matters so much.

218
0:13:11.063,000 --> 0:13:12,000
This earth,

219
0:13:13.144,000 --> 0:13:14,000
our home,

220
0:13:15.94,000 --> 0:13:17,000
is calling for us to be bold,

221
0:13:20.142,000 --> 0:13:23,000
reminding us we are all in this together --

222
0:13:23.907,000 --> 0:13:24,000
women, men,

223
0:13:25.344,000 --> 0:13:27,000
people of all gender identities,

224
0:13:27.459,000 --> 0:13:28,000
all beings.

225
0:13:29.964,000 --> 0:13:3,000
We are life force,

226
0:13:32.9,000 --> 0:13:33,000
one earth,

227
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
one chance.

228
0:13:37.182,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Let's seize it.

229
0:13:38.652,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Thank you.

230
0:13:40.106,000 --> 0:13:44,000
(Applause)

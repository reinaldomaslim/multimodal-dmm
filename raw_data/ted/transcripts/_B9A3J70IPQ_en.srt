1
0:00:12.89,000 --> 0:00:13,000
A long time ago,

2
0:00:14.591,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I was a professional animator.

3
0:00:18.393,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Music)

4
0:00:19.567,000 --> 0:00:2,000
[Eric Dyer]

5
0:00:21.497,000 --> 0:00:22,000
[Animator]

6
0:00:22.531,000 --> 0:00:23,000
[Compositor]

7
0:00:28.245,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And at night,

8
0:00:29.995,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I would make my own experimental films.

9
0:00:32.302,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Music)

10
0:00:33.379,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And I was spending a lot of time, way too much time, in front of a screen

11
0:00:38.034,000 --> 0:00:4,000
for work that would be presented on a screen,

12
0:00:40.753,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and I had this great need to get my hands back on the work again.

13
0:00:46.64,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Now, before "The Simpsons,"

14
0:00:48.305,000 --> 0:00:49,000
before "Gumby,"

15
0:00:49.485,000 --> 0:00:5,000
before "Betty Boop,"

16
0:00:51.187,000 --> 0:00:54,000
before there was such a thing as cinema and television,

17
0:00:54.667,000 --> 0:00:56,000
animation was hugely popular in this form.

18
0:00:57.615,000 --> 0:00:58,000
This is a zoetrope.

19
0:00:59.27,000 --> 0:01:,000
And you spin this drum,

20
0:01:01.075,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and you look through the slits into the inside of the drum,

21
0:01:03.968,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and you see the animation pop to life.

22
0:01:06.612,000 --> 0:01:08,000
This is animation in physical form,

23
0:01:09.334,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and it's animation I could get my hands on again.

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I took these ideas to Denmark.

25
0:01:15.134,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I went there with my family on a Fulbright Fellowship.

26
0:01:18.85,000 --> 0:01:19,000
That's my daughter, Mia.

27
0:01:22.736,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I rode around the city on my bicycle

28
0:01:25.256,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and shot all the interesting moving elements of Copenhagen:

29
0:01:31.012,000 --> 0:01:32,000
the boaters in the canals,

30
0:01:33.875,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the colors that explode in spring,

31
0:01:36.501,000 --> 0:01:37,000
the free-use city bikes,

32
0:01:38.691,000 --> 0:01:39,000
love,

33
0:01:40.472,000 --> 0:01:41,000
textures,

34
0:01:42.148,000 --> 0:01:43,000
the healthy cuisine --

35
0:01:43.519,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:46.395,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And I brought all that video back into the physical world

37
0:01:49.725,000 --> 0:01:51,000
by printing it out on these long strips of ink-jet paper

38
0:01:52.439,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and cutting out the forms.

39
0:01:54.154,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Now, I invented my own form of the zoetrope,

40
0:01:58.6,000 --> 0:02:01,000
which removes the drum

41
0:02:01.713,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and replaces the slits with a video camera.

42
0:02:07.916,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And this was very exciting for me,

43
0:02:10.611,000 --> 0:02:14,000
because it meant that I could make these physical objects,

44
0:02:14.819,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and I could make films from those objects.

45
0:02:18.153,000 --> 0:02:2,000
That's me riding on my bicycle.

46
0:02:20.191,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:26.942,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I made about 25 paper sculptures,

48
0:02:31.019,000 --> 0:02:32,000
each the size of a bicycle wheel.

49
0:02:34.011,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I brought them into the studio,

50
0:02:36.541,000 --> 0:02:37,000
spun them

51
0:02:37.755,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and shot them to make the film "Copenhagen Cycles."

52
0:02:41.023,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Music)

53
0:02:49.873,000 --> 0:02:52,000
This project not only allowed me to get my hands back on the work again

54
0:02:53.558,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but it helped me get my life back.

55
0:02:56.016,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Instead of spending 12, 15 hours a day with my face plastered to a screen,

56
0:03:01.453,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I was having these little adventures with our new family

57
0:03:05.036,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and shooting video along the way,

58
0:03:07.82,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and it was kind of a symbiosis of art and life.

59
0:03:11.55,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And I think that it's no mistake

60
0:03:13.572,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that zoetrope translates into "wheel of life."

61
0:03:17.422,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Music)

62
0:03:23.07,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But film and video does flatten sculpture,

63
0:03:25.518,000 --> 0:03:27,000
so I tried to imagine

64
0:03:27.57,000 --> 0:03:3,000
a way that animated sculpture could be experienced as such,

65
0:03:31.522,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and also a completely immersive kind of animated sculpture.

66
0:03:35.593,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And that's where I came up with the idea for the zoetrope tunnel.

67
0:03:39.635,000 --> 0:03:41,000
You walk through with a handheld strobe,

68
0:03:41.767,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and wherever you point the flashlight,

69
0:03:43.883,000 --> 0:03:44,000
the animation pops to life.

70
0:03:46.045,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I plan to finish this project in the next 30 to 40 years.

71
0:03:49.547,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:52.024,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But I did build a half-scale prototype.

73
0:03:56.441,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It's covered in Velcro,

74
0:03:58.007,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and I could lay inside on this bridge

75
0:04:01.547,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and stick animated sequences to the walls

76
0:04:04.893,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and test stuff out.

77
0:04:07.079,000 --> 0:04:11,000
People would comment that it reminded them of an MRI.

78
0:04:13.026,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And that medical connection spoke to me,

79
0:04:16.202,000 --> 0:04:17,000
because at the age of 14,

80
0:04:17.747,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I was diagnosed with a degenerative retinal condition

81
0:04:20.344,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that's slowly taking my vision away,

82
0:04:22.85,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and I'd never responded to that in my work.

83
0:04:25.954,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So I responded to it in this piece called, "Implant."

84
0:04:30.841,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It is an imaginary, super-magnified medical device

85
0:04:34.757,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that fits around the optic nerve.

86
0:04:38.648,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And the public is, in a sense, miniaturized to experience it.

87
0:04:48.27,000 --> 0:04:49,000
With a handheld strobe,

88
0:04:49.795,000 --> 0:04:52,000
they can explore the sculpture,

89
0:04:52.877,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and discover thousands of cell-sized robots

90
0:04:57.867,000 --> 0:05:,000
hard at work, leaping in and out of the optic nerve,

91
0:05:01.171,000 --> 0:05:02,000
being deployed to the retina

92
0:05:02.595,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to repair it.

93
0:05:04.081,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It's my science fiction fantasy cure of my own incurable disorder.

94
0:05:08.596,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Machine buzzes)

95
0:05:11.109,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Now, in the real-world gene therapy and gene therapy research,

96
0:05:15.529,000 --> 0:05:19,000
healthy genes are being administered to unhealthy cells using viruses.

97
0:05:21.11,000 --> 0:05:24,000
There's a lot of colorful, fluffy hope in this,

98
0:05:24.846,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and there's also some creepy, threatening idea

99
0:05:28.249,000 --> 0:05:32,000
of viruses maybe becoming an invasive species in your body.

100
0:05:35.881,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Vision loss has helped to take me away from the things

101
0:05:39.899,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that disconnect me from the world.

102
0:05:43.052,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Instead of being sealed off in an automobile,

103
0:05:45.382,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I ride my bike,

104
0:05:47.079,000 --> 0:05:48,000
take buses and trains

105
0:05:48.741,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and walk a lot.

106
0:05:50.579,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And instead of a visually intensive process in the studio, primarily,

107
0:05:55.583,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I'm also getting outdoors a lot more

108
0:05:58.193,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and using more of my senses.

109
0:06:00.916,000 --> 0:06:04,000
This landscape is a couple hours east of San Diego, California.

110
0:06:05.623,000 --> 0:06:06,000
My brother lives out that way.

111
0:06:08.608,000 --> 0:06:1,000
He and I went camping there for four days.

112
0:06:12.402,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And I grabbed my camera,

113
0:06:14.509,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and I walked through the canyons.

114
0:06:16.459,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And I tried to imagine and figure out

115
0:06:19.529,000 --> 0:06:22,000
what kind of motion would be present

116
0:06:22.651,000 --> 0:06:26,000
in this place that was so still and so devoid of motion.

117
0:06:27.229,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I think it's the stillest place I've ever been.

118
0:06:30.153,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And I realized that it was the movement of my own body through the landscape

119
0:06:35.354,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that was creating the animation.

120
0:06:37.426,000 --> 0:06:39,000
It was the motion of changing perspective.

121
0:06:40.129,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So I created this piece called "Mud Caves" from those photographs.

122
0:06:44.162,000 --> 0:06:46,000
It's a multilayered print piece,

123
0:06:46.661,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and you can think of it as a zoetrope laid flat.

124
0:06:50.02,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It's kind of my western landscape panorama.

125
0:06:53.849,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And next to the print piece there's a video monitor

126
0:06:57.013,000 --> 0:07:,000
that shows the animation hidden within the artwork.

127
0:07:01.006,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I think one of the best parts about this project for me

128
0:07:03.843,000 --> 0:07:05,000
was that I got to hang out with my brother a lot,

129
0:07:06.526,000 --> 0:07:08,000
who lives 2,500 miles away from me.

130
0:07:09.799,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And we would just sit in this seemingly eternal landscape

131
0:07:14.281,000 --> 0:07:16,000
sculpted by water over millions of years

132
0:07:17.081,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and talk.

133
0:07:18.747,000 --> 0:07:2,000
We'd talk about our kids growing up

134
0:07:20.946,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and the slowing pace of our parents,

135
0:07:23.531,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and our dad who's suffering from leukemia, memory loss and infection.

136
0:07:29.475,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And it struck me that, as individuals,

137
0:07:32.317,000 --> 0:07:33,000
we're finite,

138
0:07:33.914,000 --> 0:07:34,000
but as a family,

139
0:07:35.39,000 --> 0:07:37,000
we are an ongoing cycle --

140
0:07:37.532,000 --> 0:07:38,000
a kind of wheel of life.

141
0:07:40.716,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Now, I want to leave you with a tribute to one of my mentors.

142
0:07:45.236,000 --> 0:07:5,000
She reminds me that physical presence is important

143
0:07:50.839,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and that play is not a luxury,

144
0:07:54.217,000 --> 0:07:55,000
but a necessity.

145
0:08:02.566,000 --> 0:08:03,000
She's Pixie,

146
0:08:04.555,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and she's our family dog.

147
0:08:10.796,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And she loves to jump.

148
0:08:12.59,000 --> 0:08:13,000
(Dog barking)

149
0:08:13.994,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Dog barking and spring boinging)

150
0:08:20.466,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And this is a new kind of zoetrope

151
0:08:23.125,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that I developed at the Imaging Research Center

152
0:08:25.428,000 --> 0:08:26,000
at UMBC in Baltimore.

153
0:08:28.925,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And I call it a "real-time zoetrope."

154
0:08:31.172,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Dog barking)

155
0:08:33.779,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Dog barking and spring boinging)

156
0:08:37.55,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Thank you.

157
0:08:38.725,000 --> 0:08:39,000
(Applause)

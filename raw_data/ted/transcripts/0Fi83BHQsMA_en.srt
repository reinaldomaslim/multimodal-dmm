1
0:00:12.813,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So, I thought a lot about the first word I'd say today,

2
0:00:15.641,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and I decided to say "Colombia."

3
0:00:18.155,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And the reason, I don't know how many of you have visited Colombia,

4
0:00:22.214,000 --> 0:00:24,000
but Colombia is just north of the border with Brazil.

5
0:00:25.064,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's a beautiful country

6
0:00:26.271,000 --> 0:00:29,000
with extraordinary people, like me and others -- (Laughter) --

7
0:00:29.727,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and it's populated with incredible fauna, flora.

8
0:00:35.157,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It's got water; it's got everything to be the perfect place.

9
0:00:39.324,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But we have a few problems.

10
0:00:41.052,000 --> 0:00:42,000
You may have heard of some of them.

11
0:00:42.722,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We have the oldest standing guerrilla in the world.

12
0:00:46.415,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It's been around for over 50 years,

13
0:00:48.414,000 --> 0:00:5,000
which means that in my lifetime,

14
0:00:51.177,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I have never lived one day of peace in my country.

15
0:00:55.852,000 --> 0:00:58,000
This guerrilla -- and the main group is the FARC guerrillas,

16
0:00:59.725,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia --

17
0:01:02.142,000 --> 0:01:09,000
they have financed their war by kidnapping, by extortion,

18
0:01:09.631,000 --> 0:01:12,000
by getting into the drug trade, by illegal mining.

19
0:01:13.48,000 --> 0:01:16,000
There has been terrorism. There have been random bombs.

20
0:01:17.301,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So it's not good. It's not really good.

21
0:01:21.576,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And if you look at the human cost of this war over 50 years,

22
0:01:26.376,000 --> 0:01:3,000
we have had more than 5.7 million displaced population.

23
0:01:31.197,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It's one of the biggest displaced populations in the world,

24
0:01:34.265,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and this conflict has cost over 220,000 lives.

25
0:01:38.374,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So it's a little bit like the Bolívar wars again.

26
0:01:41.432,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It's a lot of people who have died unnecessarily.

27
0:01:44.587,000 --> 0:01:47,000
We are now in the middle of peace talks,

28
0:01:47.665,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and we've been trying to help resolve this problem peacefully,

29
0:01:50.958,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and as part of that,

30
0:01:52.518,000 --> 0:01:55,000
we decided to try something completely lateral and different:

31
0:01:56.427,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Christmas lights.

32
0:01:58.471,000 --> 0:02:,000
So Christmas lights, and you're saying,

33
0:02:00.977,000 --> 0:02:02,000
what the hell is this guy going to talk about?

34
0:02:04.173,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I am going to talk about gigantic trees

35
0:02:08.785,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that we put in nine strategic pathways in the jungle

36
0:02:14.412,000 --> 0:02:16,000
covered with Christmas lights.

37
0:02:16.421,000 --> 0:02:22,000
These trees helped us demobilize 331 guerrillas,

38
0:02:22.599,000 --> 0:02:26,000
roughly five percent of the guerrilla force at the time.

39
0:02:27.097,000 --> 0:02:29,000
These trees were lit up at night,

40
0:02:29.675,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and they had a sign beside them

41
0:02:32.044,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that said, "If Christmas can come to the jungle, you can come home.

42
0:02:36.735,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Demobilize.

43
0:02:38.435,000 --> 0:02:4,000
At Christmas, everything is possible."

44
0:02:40.916,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So how do we know these trees worked?

45
0:02:44.209,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Well, we got 331, which is okay,

46
0:02:46.215,000 --> 0:02:51,000
but we also know that not a lot of guerrillas saw them,

47
0:02:51.48,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but we know that a lot of guerrillas heard about them,

48
0:02:53.984,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and we know this

49
0:02:55.191,000 --> 0:02:58,000
because we are constantly talking to demobilized guerrillas.

50
0:02:58.295,000 --> 0:03:,000
So let me take you back four years before the trees.

51
0:03:01.05,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Four years before the trees, we were approached by the government

52
0:03:04.735,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to help them come up with a communications strategy

53
0:03:08.882,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to get as many guerrillas as we could out of the jungle.

54
0:03:12.082,000 --> 0:03:14,000
The government had a military strategy,

55
0:03:14.534,000 --> 0:03:15,000
it had a legal strategy,

56
0:03:15.862,000 --> 0:03:17,000
it had a political strategy, but it said,

57
0:03:18.691,000 --> 0:03:2,000
"We don't really have a communications strategy,

58
0:03:21.036,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and it probably would be a good thing to have,"

59
0:03:23.987,000 --> 0:03:27,000
so we decided to immediately jump into this,

60
0:03:28.373,000 --> 0:03:33,000
because it is an opportunity to affect the outcome of the conflict

61
0:03:33.588,000 --> 0:03:37,000
with the things that we do, with the tools that we have.

62
0:03:38.264,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But we didn't know very much about it.

63
0:03:40.493,000 --> 0:03:43,000
We didn't understand in Colombia, if you live in the cities,

64
0:03:43.709,000 --> 0:03:46,000
you're very far away from where the war is actually happening,

65
0:03:46.803,000 --> 0:03:48,000
so you don't really understand it,

66
0:03:48.816,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and we asked the government to give us access

67
0:03:50.982,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to as many demobilized guerrillas as possible.

68
0:03:53.524,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And we talked to about 60 of them

69
0:03:55.98,000 --> 0:04:,000
before we felt we fully understood the problem.

70
0:04:01.074,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We talked about -- they told us why they had joined the guerrillas,

71
0:04:04.386,000 --> 0:04:06,000
why the left the guerrillas, what their dreams were,

72
0:04:07.025,000 --> 0:04:08,000
what their frustrations were,

73
0:04:08.713,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and from those conversations came the underlying insight

74
0:04:13.173,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that has guided this whole campaign,

75
0:04:15.67,000 --> 0:04:2,000
which is that guerrillas are as much prisoners of their organizations

76
0:04:21.06,000 --> 0:04:23,000
as the people they hold hostage.

77
0:04:23.533,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And at the beginning, we were so touched by these stories,

78
0:04:26.313,000 --> 0:04:28,000
we were so amazed by these stories,

79
0:04:28.596,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that we thought that maybe the best way to talk to the guerrillas

80
0:04:31.735,000 --> 0:04:33,000
was to have them talk to themselves,

81
0:04:34.57,000 --> 0:04:38,000
so we recorded about a hundred different stories during the first year,

82
0:04:39.354,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and we put them on the radio and television

83
0:04:41.722,000 --> 0:04:45,000
so that the guerrillas in the jungle could hear stories, their stories,

84
0:04:46.067,000 --> 0:04:48,000
or stories similar to theirs,

85
0:04:48.415,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and when they heard them, they decided to go out.

86
0:04:51.195,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I want to tell you one of these stories.

87
0:04:53.789,000 --> 0:04:55,000
This person you see here is Giovanni Andres.

88
0:04:56.443,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Giovanni Andres is 25 when we took that picture.

89
0:04:59.274,000 --> 0:05:03,000
He had been seven years in the guerrilla, and he had demobilized very recently.

90
0:05:03.963,000 --> 0:05:05,000
His story is the following:

91
0:05:06.528,000 --> 0:05:09,000
He was recruited when he was 17,

92
0:05:09.724,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and sometime later, in his squadron, if you will,

93
0:05:14.909,000 --> 0:05:19,000
this beautiful girl was recruited, and they fell in love.

94
0:05:20.085,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Their conversations were about what their family was going to be like,

95
0:05:23.957,000 --> 0:05:25,000
what their kids' names would be,

96
0:05:26.288,000 --> 0:05:28,000
how their life would be when they left the guerrilla.

97
0:05:28.885,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But it turns out

98
0:05:30.342,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that love is very strictly forbidden in the lower ranks of the guerrilla,

99
0:05:33.935,000 --> 0:05:36,000
so their romance was discovered and they were separated.

100
0:05:37.298,000 --> 0:05:4,000
He was sent very far away, and she was left behind.

101
0:05:40.711,000 --> 0:05:42,000
She was very familiar with the territory,

102
0:05:43.368,000 --> 0:05:45,000
so one night, when she was on guard,

103
0:05:45.949,000 --> 0:05:46,000
she just left,

104
0:05:47.65,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and she went to the army, she demobilized,

105
0:05:51.112,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and she was one of the persons that we had the fortune to talk to,

106
0:05:54.996,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and we were really touched by this story,

107
0:05:57.346,000 --> 0:05:59,000
so we made a radio spot,

108
0:05:59.714,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and it turns out, by chance,

109
0:06:02.64,000 --> 0:06:05,000
that far away, many, many kilometers north,

110
0:06:06.123,000 --> 0:06:09,000
he heard her on the radio,

111
0:06:09.281,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and when he heard her on the radio, he said, "What am I doing here?

112
0:06:13.851,000 --> 0:06:18,000
She had the balls to get out. I need to do the same thing."

113
0:06:19.293,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And he did.

114
0:06:20.691,000 --> 0:06:22,000
He walked for two days and two nights,

115
0:06:23.589,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and he risked his life and he got out,

116
0:06:25.952,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and the only thing he wanted was to see her.

117
0:06:28.913,000 --> 0:06:31,000
The only thing that was in his mind was to see her.

118
0:06:32.439,000 --> 0:06:34,000
The story was, they did meet.

119
0:06:35.356,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I know you're wondering if they did meet.

120
0:06:37.887,000 --> 0:06:38,000
They did meet.

121
0:06:39.136,000 --> 0:06:43,000
She had been recruited when she was 15, and she left when she was 17,

122
0:06:43.139,000 --> 0:06:45,000
so there were a lot of other complications,

123
0:06:45.199,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but they did eventually meet.

124
0:06:46.931,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I don't know if they're together now, but I can find out. (Laughter)

125
0:06:52.206,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But what I can tell you is that our radio strategy was working.

126
0:07:00.177,000 --> 0:07:03,000
The problem is that it was working in the lower ranks of the guerrilla.

127
0:07:03.861,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It was not working with the commanders,

128
0:07:06.224,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the people that are more difficult to replace,

129
0:07:08.435,000 --> 0:07:13,000
because you can easily recruit but you can't get the older commanders.

130
0:07:14.013,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So we thought, well, we'll use the same strategy.

131
0:07:17.696,000 --> 0:07:19,000
We'll have commanders talking to commanders.

132
0:07:20.262,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And we even went as far as asking ex-commanders of the guerrilla

133
0:07:24.038,000 --> 0:07:26,000
to fly on helicopters with microphones

134
0:07:26.773,000 --> 0:07:29,000
telling the people that used to fight with them,

135
0:07:30.234,000 --> 0:07:32,000
"There is a better life out there,"

136
0:07:32.347,000 --> 0:07:34,000
"I'm doing good," "This is not worth it," etc.

137
0:07:34.924,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But, as you can all imagine, it was very easy to counteract,

138
0:07:40.03,000 --> 0:07:42,000
because what was the guerrilla going to say?

139
0:07:42.583,000 --> 0:07:45,000
"Yeah, right, if he doesn't do that, he's going to get killed."

140
0:07:45.791,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So it was easy, so we were suddenly left with nothing,

141
0:07:49.856,000 --> 0:07:51,000
because the guerrilla were spreading the word

142
0:07:52.135,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that all of those things are done

143
0:07:54.846,000 --> 0:07:59,000
because if they don't do it, they're in danger.

144
0:08:00.348,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And somebody, some brilliant person in our team,

145
0:08:03.512,000 --> 0:08:06,000
came back and said, "You know what I noticed?

146
0:08:07.15,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I noticed that around Christmastime,

147
0:08:10.707,000 --> 0:08:12,000
there have been peaks of demobilization

148
0:08:13.398,000 --> 0:08:15,000
since this war has started."

149
0:08:16.393,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And that was incredible,

150
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:24,000
because that led us to think that we needed to talk to the human being

151
0:08:24.481,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and not to the soldier.

152
0:08:26.052,000 --> 0:08:28,000
We needed to step away from talking

153
0:08:28.189,000 --> 0:08:33,000
from government to army, from army to army,

154
0:08:33.459,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and we needed to talk about the universal values,

155
0:08:36.756,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and we needed to talk about humanity.

156
0:08:39.218,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And that was when the Christmas tree happened.

157
0:08:42.592,000 --> 0:08:44,000
This picture that I have here,

158
0:08:44.599,000 --> 0:08:47,000
you see this is the planning of the Christmas trees,

159
0:08:47.791,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and that man you see there with the three stars,

160
0:08:51.54,000 --> 0:08:53,000
he's Captain Juan Manuel Valdez.

161
0:08:53.669,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Captain Valdez was the first high-ranking official

162
0:08:58.64,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to give us the helicopters and the support we needed

163
0:09:02.503,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to put these Christmas trees up,

164
0:09:04.853,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and he said in that meeting something that I will never forget.

165
0:09:08.145,000 --> 0:09:15,000
He said, "I want to do this because being generous makes me stronger,

166
0:09:15.339,000 --> 0:09:17,000
makes my men feel stronger."

167
0:09:17.691,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And I get very emotional when I remember him

168
0:09:20.431,000 --> 0:09:24,000
because he was killed later in combat and we really miss him,

169
0:09:24.816,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but I wanted you all to see him, because he was really, really important.

170
0:09:31.092,000 --> 0:09:35,000
He gave us all the support to put up the first Christmas trees.

171
0:09:35.22,000 --> 0:09:37,000
What happened later is that the guerrillas who came out

172
0:09:37.953,000 --> 0:09:4,000
during the Christmas tree operation and all of that

173
0:09:41.573,000 --> 0:09:44,000
said, "That's really good, Christmas trees are really cool,

174
0:09:45.369,000 --> 0:09:47,000
but you know what? We really don't walk anymore.

175
0:09:47.899,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We use rivers."

176
0:09:49.351,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So rivers are the highways of the jungle,

177
0:09:52.738,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and this is something we learned,

178
0:09:54.935,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and most of the recruiting was being done in and around the river villages.

179
0:10:00.237,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So we went to these river villages,

180
0:10:02.52,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and we asked the people,

181
0:10:04.421,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and probably some of them were direct acquaintances of the guerrillas.

182
0:10:07.775,000 --> 0:10:1,000
We asked them, "Can you send guerrillas a message?"

183
0:10:11.769,000 --> 0:10:14,000
We collected over 6,000 messages.

184
0:10:15.159,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Some of them were notes saying, get out.

185
0:10:17.805,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Some of them were toys. Some of them were candy.

186
0:10:20.522,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Even people took off their jewelry, their little crosses and religious things,

187
0:10:24.725,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and put them in these floating balls that we sent down the rivers

188
0:10:30.14,000 --> 0:10:32,000
so that they could be picked up at night.

189
0:10:32.735,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And we sent thousands of these down the rivers,

190
0:10:35.093,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and then picked them up later if they weren't.

191
0:10:37.263,000 --> 0:10:38,000
But lots of them were picked up.

192
0:10:38.795,000 --> 0:10:42,000
This generated, on average, a demobilization every six hours,

193
0:10:43.686,000 --> 0:10:47,000
so this was incredible and it was about: Come home at Christmas.

194
0:10:48.92,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Then came the peace process,

195
0:10:53.001,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and when the peace process started,

196
0:10:55.442,000 --> 0:10:57,000
the whole mindset of the guerrilla changed.

197
0:10:57.762,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And it changed because

198
0:11:00.087,000 --> 0:11:02,000
it makes you think, "Well, if there's a peace process,

199
0:11:02.836,000 --> 0:11:03,000
this is probably going to be over.

200
0:11:04.778,000 --> 0:11:06,000
At some point I'm going to get out."

201
0:11:06.89,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And their fears completely changed,

202
0:11:09.096,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and their fears were not about, "Am I going to get killed?"

203
0:11:12.324,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Their fears were, "Am I going to be rejected?

204
0:11:15.923,000 --> 0:11:17,000
When I get out of this, am I going to be rejected?"

205
0:11:18.732,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So the past Christmas, what we did was we asked --

206
0:11:21.803,000 --> 0:11:24,000
we found 27 mothers of guerrillas,

207
0:11:25.55,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and we asked them to give us pictures of their children,

208
0:11:29.784,000 --> 0:11:33,000
when they only could recognize themselves, so as not to put their lives in danger,

209
0:11:33.989,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and we asked them to give the most motherly message you can get,

210
0:11:38.265,000 --> 0:11:42,000
which is, "Before you were a guerrilla, you were my child,

211
0:11:42.857,000 --> 0:11:44,000
so come home, I'm waiting for you."

212
0:11:45.109,000 --> 0:11:48,000
You can see the pictures here. I'll show you a couple.

213
0:11:48.261,000 --> 0:11:49,000
(Applause)

214
0:11:49.605,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Thank you.

215
0:11:55.552,000 --> 0:12:,000
And these pictures were placed in many different places,

216
0:12:00.73,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and a lot of them came back,

217
0:12:04.892,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and it was really, really beautiful.

218
0:12:07.84,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And then we decided to work with society.

219
0:12:11.315,000 --> 0:12:13,000
So we did mothers around Christmastime.

220
0:12:13.972,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Now let's talk about the rest of the people.

221
0:12:16.826,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And you may be aware of this or not, but there was a World Cup this year,

222
0:12:22.19,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and Colombia played really well, and it was a unifying moment for Colombia.

223
0:12:29.617,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And what we did was tell the guerrillas,

224
0:12:33.453,000 --> 0:12:37,000
"Come, get out of the jungle. We're saving a place for you."

225
0:12:37.51,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So this was television, this was all different types of media saying,

226
0:12:42.575,000 --> 0:12:44,000
"We are saving a place for you."

227
0:12:45.037,000 --> 0:12:48,000
The soldier here in the commercial says,

228
0:12:48.056,000 --> 0:12:5,000
"I'm saving a place for you right here in this helicopter

229
0:12:50.921,000 --> 0:12:53,000
so that you can get out of this jungle and go enjoy the World Cup."

230
0:12:54.734,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Ex-football players, radio announcers,

231
0:12:57.901,000 --> 0:12:59,000
everybody was saving a place for the guerrilla.

232
0:13:00.195,000 --> 0:13:04,000
So since we started this work a little over eight years ago,

233
0:13:04.97,000 --> 0:13:07,000
17,000 guerrillas have demobilized.

234
0:13:08.397,000 --> 0:13:12,000
I do not -- (Applause)

235
0:13:12.436,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Thank you.

236
0:13:15.017,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I don't want to say in any way that it only has to do with what we do,

237
0:13:23.714,000 --> 0:13:29,000
but what I do know is that our work and the work that we do

238
0:13:30.288,000 --> 0:13:34,000
may have helped a lot of them start thinking about demobilization,

239
0:13:34.96,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and it may have helped a lot of them take the final decision.

240
0:13:38.968,000 --> 0:13:44,000
If that is true, advertising is still one of the most powerful tools of change

241
0:13:45.498,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that we have available.

242
0:13:47.74,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And I speak not only my behalf,

243
0:13:50.631,000 --> 0:13:52,000
but on behalf of all the colleagues I see here

244
0:13:52.975,000 --> 0:13:53,000
who work in advertising,

245
0:13:54.639,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and of all the team that has worked with me to do this,

246
0:13:58.665,000 --> 0:14:01,000
that if you want to change the world,

247
0:14:01.914,000 --> 0:14:03,000
or if you want to achieve peace, please call us.

248
0:14:04.375,000 --> 0:14:05,000
We'd love to help.

249
0:14:05.875,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Thank you.

250
0:14:07.238,000 --> 0:14:12,000
(Applause)

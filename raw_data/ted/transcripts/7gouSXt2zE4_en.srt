1
0:00:16.418,000 --> 0:00:17,000
This is the ocean as I used to know it.

2
0:00:19.085,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And I find that since I've been in the Gulf a couple of times,

3
0:00:23.322,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I really kind of am traumatized because whenever I look at the ocean now,

4
0:00:27.846,000 --> 0:00:29,000
no matter where I am,

5
0:00:30.331,000 --> 0:00:33,000
even where I know that none of the oil has gone,

6
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I sort of see slicks,

7
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and I'm finding that I'm very much haunted by it.

8
0:00:41.926,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But what I want to talk to you about today

9
0:00:44.146,000 --> 0:00:47,000
is a lot of things that try to put all of this in context,

10
0:00:47.7,000 --> 0:00:52,000
not just about the oil eruption, but what it means and why it has happened.

11
0:00:53.698,000 --> 0:00:54,000
First, just a little bit about me.

12
0:00:55.357,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I'm basically just a guy that likes to go fishing

13
0:00:57.893,000 --> 0:00:59,000
ever since I was a little kid, and because I did,

14
0:01:00.873,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I wound up studying sea birds

15
0:01:02.964,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to try to stay in the coastal habitats that I so loved.

16
0:01:06.41,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And now I mainly write books about how the ocean is changing,

17
0:01:11.02,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and the ocean is certainly changing very rapidly.

18
0:01:13.944,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Now we saw this graphic earlier on, that we really live on a hard marble

19
0:01:19.781,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that has just a slight bit of wetness to it.

20
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It's like you dipped a marble in water.

21
0:01:25.526,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And the same thing with the atmosphere:

22
0:01:27.617,000 --> 0:01:3,000
If you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball,

23
0:01:30.866,000 --> 0:01:32,000
you would get that little sphere of gas on the right.

24
0:01:33.808,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So we live on the most fragile little soap bubble you can imagine,

25
0:01:39.061,000 --> 0:01:43,000
a very sacred soap bubble, but one that is very, very easy to affect.

26
0:01:43.848,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And all the burning of oil and coal and gas, all the fossil fuels,

27
0:01:48.719,000 --> 0:01:5,000
have changed the atmosphere greatly.

28
0:01:50.912,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Carbon dioxide level has gone up and up and up.

29
0:01:53.857,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We're warming the climate.

30
0:01:56.198,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So the blowout in the Gulf

31
0:01:58.233,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is just a little piece of a much larger problem

32
0:02:02.402,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that we have with the energy that we use to run civilization.

33
0:02:06.5,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Beyond warming,

34
0:02:07.955,000 --> 0:02:1,000
we have the problem of the oceans getting more acidified --

35
0:02:11.673,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and already measurably so, and already affecting animals.

36
0:02:16.46,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Now in the laboratory, if you take a clam and you put it in the pH that is not 8.1,

37
0:02:22.912,000 --> 0:02:25,000
which is the normal pH of seawater, but 7.5,

38
0:02:26.663,000 --> 0:02:28,000
it dissolves in about three days.

39
0:02:29.293,000 --> 0:02:32,000
If you take a sea urchin larva from 8.1,

40
0:02:33.112,000 --> 0:02:37,000
put it in a pH of 7.7 -- not a huge change --

41
0:02:37.428,000 --> 0:02:39,000
it becomes deformed and dies.

42
0:02:40.105,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Already, commercial oyster larvae are dying at large scales in some places.

43
0:02:47.507,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Coral reefs are growing slower in some places because of this problem.

44
0:02:51.866,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So this really matters.

45
0:02:53.502,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Now, let's take a little tour around the Gulf a little bit.

46
0:02:57.883,000 --> 0:03:,000
One of the things that really impresses me about the people in the Gulf:

47
0:03:01.296,000 --> 0:03:03,000
They are really, really aquatic people.

48
0:03:03.608,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And they can handle water.

49
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
They can handle a hurricane that comes and goes.

50
0:03:07.916,000 --> 0:03:09,000
When the water goes down, they know what to do.

51
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But when it's something other than water, and their water habitat changes,

52
0:03:15.04,000 --> 0:03:16,000
they don't have many options.

53
0:03:16.713,000 --> 0:03:2,000
In fact, those entire communities really don't have many options.

54
0:03:20.795,000 --> 0:03:22,000
They don't have another thing they can do.

55
0:03:23.455,000 --> 0:03:27,000
They can't go and work in the local hotel business

56
0:03:27.552,000 --> 0:03:29,000
because there isn't one in their community.

57
0:03:31.782,000 --> 0:03:35,000
If you go to the Gulf and you look around, you do see a lot of oil.

58
0:03:36.264,000 --> 0:03:37,000
You see a lot of oil on the ocean.

59
0:03:38.137,000 --> 0:03:4,000
You see a lot of oil on the shoreline.

60
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
If you go to the site of the blowout, it looks pretty unbelievable.

61
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car,

62
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and you just dumped it in the ocean.

63
0:03:49.555,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And one of the really most incredible things, I think,

64
0:03:52.444,000 --> 0:03:55,000
is that there's nobody out there trying to collect it

65
0:03:56.04,000 --> 0:03:58,000
at the site where it is densest.

66
0:03:59.657,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Parts of the ocean there look just absolutely apocalyptic.

67
0:04:05.817,000 --> 0:04:08,000
You go in along the shore, you can find it everywhere.

68
0:04:10.316,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It's really messy.

69
0:04:11.496,000 --> 0:04:13,000
If you go to the places where it's just arriving,

70
0:04:13.891,000 --> 0:04:15,000
like the eastern part of the Gulf, in Alabama,

71
0:04:16.35,000 --> 0:04:17,000
there's still people using the beach

72
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
while there are people cleaning up the beach.

73
0:04:20.427,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And they have a very strange way of cleaning up the beach.

74
0:04:23.173,000 --> 0:04:25,000
They're not allowed to put more than 10 pounds of sand

75
0:04:25.856,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in a 50-gallon plastic bag.

76
0:04:27.588,000 --> 0:04:29,000
They have thousands and thousands of plastic bags.

77
0:04:29.968,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I don't know what they'll do with all that stuff.

78
0:04:32.282,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Meanwhile, there are still people trying to use the beach.

79
0:04:35.027,000 --> 0:04:37,000
They don't see the sign that says: "Stay out of the water."

80
0:04:37.829,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Their kids are in the water;

81
0:04:39.282,000 --> 0:04:41,000
they're getting tar all over their clothes and their sandals--

82
0:04:42.235,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It's a mess.

83
0:04:43.47,000 --> 0:04:46,000
If you go to where the oil has been for a while, it's an even bigger mess.

84
0:04:46.998,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And there's basically nobody there anymore,

85
0:04:49.406,000 --> 0:04:51,000
a few people trying to keep using it.

86
0:04:53.018,000 --> 0:04:55,000
You see people who are really shell-shocked.

87
0:04:55.38,000 --> 0:04:56,000
They are very hardworking people.

88
0:04:57.393,000 --> 0:04:59,000
All they know about life is they get up in the morning,

89
0:05:00.027,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and if their engine starts, they go to work.

90
0:05:02.347,000 --> 0:05:06,000
They always felt that they could rely on the assurances

91
0:05:06.66,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that nature brought them through the ecosystem of the Gulf.

92
0:05:09.974,000 --> 0:05:11,000
They're finding that their world is really collapsing.

93
0:05:12.79,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And so you can see, literally, signs of their shock ...

94
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
signs of their outrage ...

95
0:05:25.882,000 --> 0:05:26,000
signs of their anger ...

96
0:05:32.581,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and signs of their grief.

97
0:05:36.094,000 --> 0:05:38,000
These are the things that you can see.

98
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
There's a lot you can't see, also, underwater.

99
0:05:44.886,000 --> 0:05:45,000
What's going on underwater?

100
0:05:46.779,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Well, some people say there are oil plumes.

101
0:05:50.412,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Some people say there are not oil plumes.

102
0:05:54.083,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And Congressman Markey asks, you know,

103
0:05:56.458,000 --> 0:06:,000
"Is it going to take a submarine ride to see if there are really oil plumes?"

104
0:06:01.987,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But I couldn't take a submarine ride --

105
0:06:03.922,000 --> 0:06:07,000
especially between the time I knew I was coming here and today --

106
0:06:08.035,000 --> 0:06:11,000
so I had to do a little experiment myself

107
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to see if there was oil in the Gulf of Mexico.

108
0:06:13.67,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So this is the Gulf of Mexico ...

109
0:06:16.596,000 --> 0:06:17,000
sparkling place full of fish.

110
0:06:19.671,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And I created a little oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

111
0:06:23.134,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And I learned, in fact, I confirmed the hypothesis

112
0:06:25.858,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that oil and water don't mix ...

113
0:06:29.569,000 --> 0:06:31,000
until you add a dispersant ...

114
0:06:33.348,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and then ...

115
0:06:36.15,000 --> 0:06:37,000
they start mixing.

116
0:06:38.669,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And you add a little energy from the wind and the waves,

117
0:06:42.914,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and you get a big mess,

118
0:06:46.233,000 --> 0:06:49,000
a big mess that you can't possibly clean,

119
0:06:49.392,000 --> 0:06:52,000
you can't touch, you can't extract

120
0:06:52.437,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and, I think most importantly -- this is what I think --

121
0:06:55.726,000 --> 0:06:56,000
you can't see it.

122
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
I think it's being hidden on purpose.

123
0:07:00.618,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Now this is such a catastrophe and such a mess

124
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that lots of stuff is leaking out on the edges of the information stream.

125
0:07:06.954,000 --> 0:07:07,000
But as many people have said,

126
0:07:08.635,000 --> 0:07:11,000
there's a large attempt to suppress what's going on.

127
0:07:11.769,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Personally, I think that the dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body,

128
0:07:18.765,000 --> 0:07:21,000
because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene.

129
0:07:22.83,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But you can see it.

130
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
You can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface,

131
0:07:28.472,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and then it is attacked,

132
0:07:31.127,000 --> 0:07:33,000
because they don't want the evidence, in my opinion.

133
0:07:34.637,000 --> 0:07:35,000
OK.

134
0:07:36.158,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We heard that bacteria eat oil?

135
0:07:38.679,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So do sea turtles.

136
0:07:40.785,000 --> 0:07:41,000
When it breaks up,

137
0:07:42.217,000 --> 0:07:45,000
it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria.

138
0:07:46.156,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Turtles eat it. It gets in the gills of fish.

139
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
These guys have to swim around through it.

140
0:07:51.541,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I heard the most incredible story today when I was on the train coming here.

141
0:07:56.959,000 --> 0:07:58,000
A writer named Ted Williams called me,

142
0:07:59.783,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and he was asking me a couple of questions about what I saw,

143
0:08:02.691,000 --> 0:08:05,000
because he's writing an article for Audubon magazine.

144
0:08:05.858,000 --> 0:08:08,000
He said that he had been in the Gulf a little while ago; like about a week ago,

145
0:08:09.629,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and a guy who had been a recreational fishing guide

146
0:08:13.567,000 --> 0:08:15,000
took him out to show him what's going on.

147
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
That guide's entire calendar year is canceled bookings.

148
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
He has no bookings left.

149
0:08:23.197,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Everybody wanted their deposit back, everybody is fleeing.

150
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
That's the story of thousands of people.

151
0:08:28.251,000 --> 0:08:33,000
But he told Ted that on the last day he went out,

152
0:08:33.885,000 --> 0:08:36,000
a bottlenose dolphin suddenly appeared next to the boat,

153
0:08:38.027,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and it was splattering oil out its blowhole.

154
0:08:43.198,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And he moved away because it was his last fishing trip,

155
0:08:49.059,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and he knew that the dolphins scare fish.

156
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So he moved away from it, turned around a few minutes later,

157
0:08:55.168,000 --> 0:08:57,000
it was right next to the side of the boat again.

158
0:08:57.439,000 --> 0:09:,000
He said that in 30 years of fishing he had never seen a dolphin do that.

159
0:09:00.884,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And he felt that --

160
0:09:02.953,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Sigh)

161
0:09:04.18,000 --> 0:09:07,000
he felt that it was coming to ask for help.

162
0:09:08.198,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Sorry.

163
0:09:10.652,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Now, in the Exxon Valdez spill,

164
0:09:15.12,000 --> 0:09:19,000
about 30 percent of the killer whales died in the first few months.

165
0:09:19.898,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Their numbers have never recovered.

166
0:09:21.842,000 --> 0:09:25,000
So the recovery rate of all this stuff is going to be variable.

167
0:09:26.731,000 --> 0:09:28,000
It's going to take longer for some things.

168
0:09:29.58,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And some things, I think, will probably come back a little faster.

169
0:09:33.533,000 --> 0:09:35,000
The other thing about the Gulf that is important

170
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
is that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the Gulf

171
0:09:39.749,000 --> 0:09:41,000
at certain parts of the year.

172
0:09:43.082,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So the Gulf is a really important piece of water --

173
0:09:45.713,000 --> 0:09:49,000
more important than a similar volume of water in the open Atlantic Ocean.

174
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
These tuna swim the entire ocean.

175
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
They get in the Gulf Stream, they go all the way to Europe.

176
0:09:56.057,000 --> 0:09:58,000
When it comes time to spawn, they come inside,

177
0:09:58.249,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and these two tuna that were tagged,

178
0:09:59.998,000 --> 0:10:01,000
you can see them on the spawning grounds

179
0:10:02.122,000 --> 0:10:04,000
very much right in the area of the slick.

180
0:10:04.851,000 --> 0:10:06,000
They're probably having, at the very least,

181
0:10:07.36,000 --> 0:10:09,000
a catastrophic spawning season this year.

182
0:10:10.137,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I'm hoping that maybe the adults are avoiding that dirty water.

183
0:10:13.977,000 --> 0:10:17,000
They don't usually like to go into water that is very cloudy anyway.

184
0:10:18.408,000 --> 0:10:21,000
But these are really high-performance athletic animals.

185
0:10:22.224,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I don't know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills.

186
0:10:25.49,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I don't know if it'll affect the adults.

187
0:10:27.46,000 --> 0:10:29,000
If it's not, it's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae,

188
0:10:30.301,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I would certainly think.

189
0:10:31.512,000 --> 0:10:34,000
But if you look at that graph that goes down and down and down,

190
0:10:34.879,000 --> 0:10:38,000
that's what we've done to this species through overfishing over many decades.

191
0:10:39.624,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So while the oil spill, the leak, the eruption, is a catastrophe,

192
0:10:44.805,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I think it's important to keep in mind

193
0:10:47.562,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that we've done a lot to affect what's in the ocean, for a very long time.

194
0:10:51.702,000 --> 0:10:54,000
It's not like we're starting with something that's been OK.

195
0:10:55.064,000 --> 0:10:57,000
We're starting with something that's had a lot of stresses

196
0:10:57.824,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and a lot of problems to begin with.

197
0:10:59.71,000 --> 0:11:03,000
If you look around at the birds, there are a lot of birds in the Gulf

198
0:11:03.76,000 --> 0:11:05,000
that concentrate in the Gulf at certain times of the year,

199
0:11:06.551,000 --> 0:11:07,000
but then leave.

200
0:11:07.859,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And they populate much larger areas.

201
0:11:12.647,000 --> 0:11:16,000
For instance, most of the birds in this picture are migratory birds.

202
0:11:16.861,000 --> 0:11:17,000
They were all on the Gulf in May,

203
0:11:18.727,000 --> 0:11:21,000
while oil was starting to come ashore in certain places.

204
0:11:21.868,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Down on the lower left there are ruddy turnstones and sanderlings.

205
0:11:26.447,000 --> 0:11:27,000
They breed in the High Arctic,

206
0:11:28.194,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and they winter down in southern South America.

207
0:11:30.78,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But they concentrate in the Gulf and then fan out all across the Arctic.

208
0:11:35.615,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I saw birds that breed in Greenland, in the Gulf.

209
0:11:40.112,000 --> 0:11:43,000
So this is a hemispheric issue.

210
0:11:43.547,000 --> 0:11:47,000
The economic effects go at least nationally in many ways.

211
0:11:48.367,000 --> 0:11:51,000
The biological effects are certainly hemispheric.

212
0:11:54.127,000 --> 0:11:59,000
I think that this is one of the most absolutely mind-boggling examples

213
0:11:59.344,000 --> 0:12:01,000
of total unpreparedness that I can even think of.

214
0:12:02.18,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Even when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor,

215
0:12:06.102,000 --> 0:12:07,000
at least they shot back.

216
0:12:07.533,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do.

217
0:12:11.64,000 --> 0:12:14,000
There was nothing ready,

218
0:12:15.3,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and, you know, as we can see by what they're doing.

219
0:12:18.714,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Mainly what they're doing is booms and dispersants.

220
0:12:21.502,000 --> 0:12:24,000
The booms are absolutely not made for open water.

221
0:12:25.278,000 --> 0:12:29,000
They don't even attempt to corral the oil where it is most concentrated.

222
0:12:30.143,000 --> 0:12:32,000
They get near shore -- Look at these two boats.

223
0:12:32.401,000 --> 0:12:34,000
That one on the right is called Fishing Fool.

224
0:12:35.049,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And I think, you know, that's a great name

225
0:12:37.083,000 --> 0:12:4,000
for boats that think that they're going to do anything

226
0:12:40.165,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to make a dent in this, by dragging a boom between them

227
0:12:43.261,000 --> 0:12:45,000
when there are literally hundreds of thousands of square miles

228
0:12:46.249,000 --> 0:12:48,000
in the Gulf right now with oil at the surface.

229
0:12:49.154,000 --> 0:12:52,000
The dispersants make the oil go right under the booms.

230
0:12:52.928,000 --> 0:12:55,000
The booms are only about 13 inches in diameter.

231
0:12:57.127,000 --> 0:13:,000
So it's just absolutely crazy.

232
0:13:00.177,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Here are shrimp boats employed.

233
0:13:01.895,000 --> 0:13:04,000
There are hundreds of shrimp boats employed to drag booms instead of nets.

234
0:13:05.86,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Here they are working.

235
0:13:07.207,000 --> 0:13:08,000
You can see easily

236
0:13:09.028,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that all the oily water just goes over the back of the boom.

237
0:13:12.947,000 --> 0:13:13,000
All they're doing is stirring it.

238
0:13:14.921,000 --> 0:13:15,000
It's just ridiculous.

239
0:13:18.364,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Also, for all the shoreline that has booms --

240
0:13:20.493,000 --> 0:13:22,000
hundreds and hundreds of miles of shoreline --

241
0:13:22.688,000 --> 0:13:23,000
all of the shoreline that has booms,

242
0:13:24.493,000 --> 0:13:26,000
there's adjacent shoreline that doesn't have any booms.

243
0:13:27.203,000 --> 0:13:32,000
There is ample opportunity for oil and dirty water to get in behind them.

244
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And that lower photo, that's a bird colony that has been boomed.

245
0:13:36.107,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Everybody's trying to protect the bird colonies there.

246
0:13:40.7,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Well, as an ornithologist, I can tell you that birds fly, and that --

247
0:13:45.955,000 --> 0:13:47,000
(Laughter)

248
0:13:50.931,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and that booming a bird colony doesn't do it; it doesn't do it.

249
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
These birds make a living by diving into the water.

250
0:14:00.883,000 --> 0:14:01,000
In fact ...

251
0:14:03.4,000 --> 0:14:06,000
really what I think they should do, if anything --

252
0:14:06.567,000 --> 0:14:09,000
they're trying so hard to protect those nests --

253
0:14:09.728,000 --> 0:14:11,000
actually, if they destroyed every single nest,

254
0:14:12.425,000 --> 0:14:14,000
some of the birds would leave,

255
0:14:14.485,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and that would be better for them this year.

256
0:14:17.675,000 --> 0:14:18,000
As far as cleaning them ...

257
0:14:20.261,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I don't mean to cast any aspersion on people cleaning birds.

258
0:14:25.218,000 --> 0:14:28,000
It's really, really important that we express our compassion.

259
0:14:29.142,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I think that's the most important thing that people have, is compassion.

260
0:14:33.286,000 --> 0:14:36,000
It's really important to get those images and to show it.

261
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
But really, where are those birds going to get released to?

262
0:14:40.659,000 --> 0:14:42,000
It's like taking somebody out of a burning building,

263
0:14:43.128,000 --> 0:14:44,000
treating them for smoke inhalation

264
0:14:44.792,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and sending them back into the building, because the oil is still gushing.

265
0:14:48.946,000 --> 0:14:51,000
I refuse to acknowledge this as anything like an accident.

266
0:14:52.862,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I think that this is the result of gross negligence.

267
0:14:56.473,000 --> 0:15:,000
(Applause)

268
0:15:01.608,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Not just BP.

269
0:15:03.915,000 --> 0:15:09,000
BP operated very sloppily and very recklessly because they could.

270
0:15:10.596,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And they were allowed to do so

271
0:15:12.567,000 --> 0:15:16,000
because of the absolute failure of oversight of the government

272
0:15:16.984,000 --> 0:15:2,000
that is supposed to be our government, protecting us.

273
0:15:23.565,000 --> 0:15:24,000
It turns out that --

274
0:15:25.098,000 --> 0:15:28,000
you see this sign on every commercial vessel in the United States --

275
0:15:28.353,000 --> 0:15:3,000
you know, if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil,

276
0:15:30.979,000 --> 0:15:31,000
you would be in big trouble.

277
0:15:32.382,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And you have to really wonder who are the laws made for,

278
0:15:37.013,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and who has gotten above the laws.

279
0:15:40.709,000 --> 0:15:42,000
And there are things that we can do in the future.

280
0:15:43.084,000 --> 0:15:46,000
We could have the kinds of equipment that we would really need.

281
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
It would not take an awful lot to anticipate

282
0:15:49.136,000 --> 0:15:51,000
that after making 30,000 holes

283
0:15:51.555,000 --> 0:15:53,000
in the sea floor of the Gulf of Mexico looking for oil,

284
0:15:54.404,000 --> 0:15:56,000
oil might start coming out of one of them.

285
0:15:56.821,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And you'd have some idea of what to do.

286
0:16:00.005,000 --> 0:16:02,000
That's certainly one of the things we need to do.

287
0:16:02.32,000 --> 0:16:06,000
But I think we have to understand where this leak really started from.

288
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
It really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there

289
0:16:12.631,000 --> 0:16:13,000
because it's our government,

290
0:16:14.37,000 --> 0:16:16,000
meant to protect the larger public interest.

291
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
So I think that the oil blowout, the bank bailout,

292
0:16:25.9,000 --> 0:16:31,000
the mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause.

293
0:16:33.496,000 --> 0:16:35,000
We still seem to understand that at least,

294
0:16:36.389,000 --> 0:16:4,000
we need the police to protect us from a few bad people.

295
0:16:40.803,000 --> 0:16:43,000
And even though the police can be a little annoying at times --

296
0:16:43.83,000 --> 0:16:44,000
giving us tickets and stuff like that --

297
0:16:45.765,000 --> 0:16:47,000
nobody says that we should just get rid of them.

298
0:16:48.314,000 --> 0:16:5,000
But in the entire rest of government right now

299
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
and for the last at least 30 years,

300
0:16:53.146,000 --> 0:16:56,000
there has been a culture of deregulation

301
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
that is caused directly by the people who we need to be protected from,

302
0:17:02.214,000 --> 0:17:04,000
buying the government out from under us.

303
0:17:05.523,000 --> 0:17:12,000
(Applause)

304
0:17:15.181,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Now this has been a problem for a very, very long time.

305
0:17:18.425,000 --> 0:17:23,000
You can see that corporations were illegal at the founding of America,

306
0:17:23.808,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and even Thomas Jefferson complained

307
0:17:26.54,000 --> 0:17:31,000
that they were already bidding defiance to the laws of our country.

308
0:17:33.422,000 --> 0:17:35,000
OK, people who say they're conservative,

309
0:17:36.951,000 --> 0:17:4,000
if they really wanted to be really conservative and patriotic,

310
0:17:41.788,000 --> 0:17:44,000
they would tell these corporations to go to hell.

311
0:17:45.443,000 --> 0:17:47,000
That's what it would really mean to be conservative.

312
0:17:49.067,000 --> 0:17:53,000
So what we really need to do is regain the idea

313
0:17:53.789,000 --> 0:17:56,000
that it's our government safeguarding our interests,

314
0:17:57.028,000 --> 0:18:01,000
and regain a sense of unity and common cause in our country

315
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
that really has been lost.

316
0:18:04.192,000 --> 0:18:05,000
I think there are signs of hope.

317
0:18:06.146,000 --> 0:18:08,000
We seem to be waking up a little bit.

318
0:18:08.675,000 --> 0:18:11,000
The Glass-Steagall Act -- which was really to protect us

319
0:18:11.711,000 --> 0:18:14,000
from the kind of thing that caused the recession to happen,

320
0:18:14.761,000 --> 0:18:17,000
and the bank meltdown and all that stuff that required the bailouts --

321
0:18:18.477,000 --> 0:18:22,000
that was put in effect in 1933, was systematically destroyed.

322
0:18:23.197,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Now there's a mood to put some of that stuff back in place,

323
0:18:26.958,000 --> 0:18:3,000
but the lobbyists are already there trying to weaken the regulations

324
0:18:31.503,000 --> 0:18:33,000
after the legislation has just passed.

325
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
So it's a continued fight.

326
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
It's a historic moment right now.

327
0:18:38.332,000 --> 0:18:42,000
We're either going to have an absolutely unmitigated catastrophe

328
0:18:42.369,000 --> 0:18:43,000
of this oil leak in the Gulf,

329
0:18:44.03,000 --> 0:18:46,000
or we will make the moment we need out of this,

330
0:18:46.7,000 --> 0:18:47,000
as many people have noted today.

331
0:18:48.391,000 --> 0:18:49,000
There's certainly a common theme

332
0:18:50.071,000 --> 0:18:52,000
about needing to make the moment out of this.

333
0:18:52.502,000 --> 0:18:56,000
We've been through this before with other ways of offshore drilling.

334
0:18:56.541,000 --> 0:18:58,000
The first offshore wells were called whales.

335
0:18:59.565,000 --> 0:19:01,000
The first offshore drills were called harpoons.

336
0:19:02.447,000 --> 0:19:04,000
We emptied the ocean of the whales at that time.

337
0:19:05.995,000 --> 0:19:06,000
Now are we stuck with this?

338
0:19:07.715,000 --> 0:19:1,000
Ever since we lived in caves, every time we wanted any energy,

339
0:19:11.651,000 --> 0:19:14,000
we lit something on fire, and that is still what we're doing.

340
0:19:15.226,000 --> 0:19:19,000
We're still lighting something on fire every time we want energy.

341
0:19:19.85,000 --> 0:19:22,000
And people say we can't have clean energy

342
0:19:23.359,000 --> 0:19:25,000
because it's too expensive.

343
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
Who says it's too expensive?

344
0:19:28.056,000 --> 0:19:3,000
People who sell us fossil fuels.

345
0:19:30.338,000 --> 0:19:32,000
We've been here before with energy,

346
0:19:33.26,000 --> 0:19:37,000
and people saying the economy cannot withstand a switch,

347
0:19:37.385,000 --> 0:19:4,000
because the cheapest energy was slavery.

348
0:19:40.621,000 --> 0:19:42,000
Energy is always a moral issue.

349
0:19:43.402,000 --> 0:19:45,000
It's an issue that is moral right now.

350
0:19:45.691,000 --> 0:19:47,000
It's a matter of right and wrong.

351
0:19:48.258,000 --> 0:19:49,000
Thank you very much.

352
0:19:49.45,000 --> 0:19:5,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.683,000 --> 0:00:16,000
It was November 1, 2002,

2
0:00:18.208,000 --> 0:00:2,000
my first day as a principal,

3
0:00:21.677,000 --> 0:00:25,000
but hardly my first day in the school district of Philadelphia.

4
0:00:27.218,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I graduated from Philadelphia public schools,

5
0:00:30.625,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and I went on to teach special education for 20 years

6
0:00:34.792,000 --> 0:00:37,000
in a low-income, low-performing school

7
0:00:38.167,000 --> 0:00:39,000
in North Philadelphia,

8
0:00:40.292,000 --> 0:00:41,000
where crime is rampant

9
0:00:42.333,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and deep poverty is among the highest in the nation.

10
0:00:46.958,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Shortly after I walked into my new school,

11
0:00:50.583,000 --> 0:00:53,000
a huge fight broke out among the girls.

12
0:00:56.083,000 --> 0:00:58,000
After things were quickly under control,

13
0:00:59.5,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I immediately called a meeting

14
0:01:02.542,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in the school's auditorium

15
0:01:04.833,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to introduce myself as the school's new principal.

16
0:01:08.792,000 --> 0:01:1,000
(Applause)

17
0:01:12.458,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I walked in angry,

18
0:01:15.154,000 --> 0:01:16,000
a little nervous --

19
0:01:16.546,000 --> 0:01:17,000
(Laughter) --

20
0:01:17.708,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but I was determined

21
0:01:19.792,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to set the tone for my new students.

22
0:01:23.083,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I started listing as forcefully as I could

23
0:01:26.958,000 --> 0:01:28,000
my expectations for their behavior

24
0:01:30.125,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and my expectations for what they would learn in school.

25
0:01:34.625,000 --> 0:01:35,000
When, all of a sudden,

26
0:01:37.042,000 --> 0:01:4,000
a girl way in the back of the auditorium,

27
0:01:40.75,000 --> 0:01:41,000
she stood up

28
0:01:42.875,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and she said, "Miss!

29
0:01:45.625,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Miss!"

30
0:01:47.75,000 --> 0:01:5,000
When our eyes locked, she said,

31
0:01:52.25,000 --> 0:01:55,000
"Why do you keep calling this a school?

32
0:01:56.708,000 --> 0:01:58,000
This is not a school."

33
0:02:00.625,000 --> 0:02:01,000
In one outburst,

34
0:02:03.125,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Ashley had expressed what I felt

35
0:02:07.167,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and never quite was able to articulate

36
0:02:10.292,000 --> 0:02:14,000
about my own experience when I attended a low-performing school

37
0:02:14.917,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in the same neighborhood, many, many, many years earlier.

38
0:02:19.5,000 --> 0:02:23,000
That school was definitely not a school.

39
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Fast forwarding a decade later to 2012,

40
0:02:31.083,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I was entering my third low-performing school as principal.

41
0:02:36.667,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I was to be Strawberry Mansion's fourth principal in four years.

42
0:02:42.75,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It was labeled "low-performing and persistently dangerous"

43
0:02:47.708,000 --> 0:02:49,000
due to its low test scores

44
0:02:50.625,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and high number of weapons,

45
0:02:53.375,000 --> 0:02:55,000
drugs, assaults and arrests.

46
0:02:57.833,000 --> 0:03:,000
Shortly as I approached the door of my new school

47
0:03:01.75,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and attempted to enter,

48
0:03:03.542,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and found the door locked with chains,

49
0:03:07.458,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I could hear Ashley's voice in my ears

50
0:03:10.875,000 --> 0:03:12,000
going, "Miss! Miss!

51
0:03:14.833,000 --> 0:03:16,000
This is not a school."

52
0:03:17.792,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The halls were dim and dark from poor lighting.

53
0:03:21.708,000 --> 0:03:24,000
There were tons of piles of broken old furniture

54
0:03:25.042,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and desks in the classrooms,

55
0:03:27.333,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and there were thousands of unused materials and resources.

56
0:03:32.625,000 --> 0:03:34,000
This was not a school.

57
0:03:36.292,000 --> 0:03:37,000
As the year progressed,

58
0:03:38.75,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I noticed that the classrooms were nearly empty.

59
0:03:43.958,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The students were just scared:

60
0:03:46.75,000 --> 0:03:5,000
scared to sit in rows in fear that something would happen;

61
0:03:51.583,000 --> 0:03:55,000
scared because they were often teased in the cafeteria for eating free food.

62
0:03:56.792,000 --> 0:04:,000
They were scared from all the fighting and all the bullying.

63
0:04:01.792,000 --> 0:04:04,000
This was not a school.

64
0:04:07.375,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And then, there were the teachers,

65
0:04:10.125,000 --> 0:04:14,000
who were incredibly afraid for their own safety,

66
0:04:14.833,000 --> 0:04:19,000
so they had low expectations for the students and themselves,

67
0:04:20.5,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and they were totally unaware of their role

68
0:04:23.833,000 --> 0:04:25,000
in the destruction of the school's culture.

69
0:04:26.5,000 --> 0:04:29,000
This was the most troubling of all.

70
0:04:30.791,000 --> 0:04:32,000
You see, Ashley was right,

71
0:04:34.833,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and not just about her school.

72
0:04:37.667,000 --> 0:04:39,000
For far too many schools,

73
0:04:39.833,000 --> 0:04:41,000
for kids who live in poverty,

74
0:04:41.917,000 --> 0:04:43,000
their schools are really not schools at all.

75
0:04:45.583,000 --> 0:04:46,000
But this can change.

76
0:04:47.958,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Let me tell you how it's being done at Strawberry Mansion High School.

77
0:04:54.083,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Anybody who's ever worked with me will tell you

78
0:04:57.917,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I am known for my slogans.

79
0:05:00.583,000 --> 0:05:01,000
(Laughter)

80
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So today, I am going to use three

81
0:05:05.554,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that have been paramount in our quest for change.

82
0:05:09.917,000 --> 0:05:1,000
My first slogan is:

83
0:05:12.458,000 --> 0:05:14,000
if you're going to lead, lead.

84
0:05:15.75,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I always believed

85
0:05:17.894,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that what happens in a school and what does not happen in a school

86
0:05:21.792,000 --> 0:05:22,000
is up to the principal.

87
0:05:23.958,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I am the principal,

88
0:05:25.833,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and having that title required me to lead.

89
0:05:30.125,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I was not going to stay in my office,

90
0:05:32.846,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I was not going to delegate my work,

91
0:05:35.691,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and I was not going to be afraid to address anything

92
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that was not good for children,

93
0:05:41.084,000 --> 0:05:43,000
whether that made me liked or not.

94
0:05:45.228,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I am a leader,

95
0:05:46.965,000 --> 0:05:49,000
so I know I cannot do anything alone.

96
0:05:50.788,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So, I assembled a top-notch leadership team

97
0:05:53.475,000 --> 0:05:56,000
who believed in the possibility of all the children,

98
0:05:56.583,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and together, we tackled the small things,

99
0:06:00.456,000 --> 0:06:04,000
like resetting every single locker combination by hand

100
0:06:05.083,000 --> 0:06:07,000
so that every student could have a secure locker.

101
0:06:08.583,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We decorated every bulletin board in that building

102
0:06:12.039,000 --> 0:06:14,000
with bright, colorful, and positive messages.

103
0:06:15.428,000 --> 0:06:18,000
We took the chains off the front doors of the school.

104
0:06:18.579,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We got the lightbulbs replaced,

105
0:06:20.698,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and we cleaned every classroom to its core,

106
0:06:23.878,000 --> 0:06:27,000
recycling every, every textbook that was not needed,

107
0:06:28.377,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and discarded thousands of old materials and furniture.

108
0:06:32.692,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We used two dumpsters per day.

109
0:06:36.875,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And, of course, of course,

110
0:06:39.456,000 --> 0:06:4,000
we tackled the big stuff,

111
0:06:41.857,000 --> 0:06:44,000
like rehauling the entire school budget

112
0:06:45.803,000 --> 0:06:49,000
so that we can reallocate funds to have more teachers and support staff.

113
0:06:51.733,000 --> 0:06:56,000
We rebuilt the entire school day schedule from scratch

114
0:06:57.292,000 --> 0:07:,000
to add a variety of start and end times,

115
0:07:01.195,000 --> 0:07:04,000
remediation, honors courses,

116
0:07:04.792,000 --> 0:07:07,000
extracurricular activities, and counseling,

117
0:07:08.416,000 --> 0:07:09,000
all during the school day.

118
0:07:11.717,000 --> 0:07:12,000
All during the school day.

119
0:07:16.217,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We created a deployment plan

120
0:07:20.473,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that specified where every single support person and police officer would be

121
0:07:26.145,000 --> 0:07:27,000
every minute of the day,

122
0:07:27.573,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and we monitored at every second of the day,

123
0:07:31.5,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and, our best invention ever,

124
0:07:34.299,000 --> 0:07:37,000
we devised a schoolwide discipline program

125
0:07:37.957,000 --> 0:07:38,000
titled "Non-negotiables."

126
0:07:40.137,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It was a behavior system --

127
0:07:44.368,000 --> 0:07:48,000
designed to promote positive behavior at all times.

128
0:07:49.131,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The results?

129
0:07:51.085,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Strawberry Mansion was removed from the Persistently Dangerous List

130
0:07:55.237,000 --> 0:07:57,000
our first year after being --

131
0:07:57.7,000 --> 0:07:59,000
(Applause) --

132
0:08:03.8,000 --> 0:08:07,000
after being on the Persistently Dangerous List for five consecutive years.

133
0:08:08.732,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Leaders make the impossible possible.

134
0:08:13.939,000 --> 0:08:15,000
That brings me to my second slogan:

135
0:08:16.865,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So what? Now what?

136
0:08:19.491,000 --> 0:08:2,000
(Laughter)

137
0:08:20.597,000 --> 0:08:24,000
(Applause)

138
0:08:25.483,000 --> 0:08:26,000
When we looked at the data,

139
0:08:27.718,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and we met with the staff,

140
0:08:29.812,000 --> 0:08:3,000
there were many excuses

141
0:08:31.75,000 --> 0:08:34,000
for why Strawberry Mansion was low-performing and persistently dangerous.

142
0:08:36.129,000 --> 0:08:4,000
They said that only 68 percent of the kids come to school on a regular basis,

143
0:08:41.02,000 --> 0:08:44,000
100 percent of them live in poverty,

144
0:08:44.587,000 --> 0:08:46,000
only one percent of the parents participate,

145
0:08:48.173,000 --> 0:08:49,000
many of the children

146
0:08:49.828,000 --> 0:08:52,000
come from incarceration and single-parent homes,

147
0:08:53.4,000 --> 0:08:57,000
39 percent of the students have special needs,

148
0:08:57.728,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and the state data revealed

149
0:09:00.695,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that six percent of the students were proficient in algebra,

150
0:09:05.017,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and 10 were proficient in literature.

151
0:09:10.817,000 --> 0:09:13,000
After they got through telling us all the stories

152
0:09:14.767,000 --> 0:09:17,000
of how awful the conditions and the children were,

153
0:09:18.75,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I looked at them,

154
0:09:21.162,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and I said, "So what. Now what?

155
0:09:25.088,000 --> 0:09:26,000
What are we gonna do about it?"

156
0:09:26.915,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Applause)

157
0:09:32.654,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Eliminating excuses at every turn became my primary responsibility.

158
0:09:38.552,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We addressed every one of those excuses

159
0:09:41.614,000 --> 0:09:43,000
through a mandatory professional development,

160
0:09:44.194,000 --> 0:09:48,000
paving the way for intense focus on teaching and learning.

161
0:09:50.037,000 --> 0:09:52,000
After many observations,

162
0:09:52.18,000 --> 0:09:56,000
what we determined was that teachers knew what to teach

163
0:09:57.462,000 --> 0:09:59,000
but they did not know how to teach

164
0:10:00.25,000 --> 0:10:02,000
so many children with so many vast abilities.

165
0:10:03.798,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So, we developed a lesson delivery model for instruction

166
0:10:08.896,000 --> 0:10:11,000
that focused on small group instruction,

167
0:10:12.66,000 --> 0:10:16,000
making it possible for all the students to get their individual needs met

168
0:10:17.478,000 --> 0:10:18,000
in the classroom.

169
0:10:19.17,000 --> 0:10:2,000
The results?

170
0:10:21.149,000 --> 0:10:25,000
After one year, state data revealed

171
0:10:25.826,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that our scores have grown by 171 percent in Algebra

172
0:10:30.161,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and 107 percent in literature.

173
0:10:32.806,000 --> 0:10:34,000
(Applause)

174
0:10:37.3,000 --> 0:10:39,000
We have a very long way to go,

175
0:10:40.049,000 --> 0:10:41,000
a very long way to go,

176
0:10:42.625,000 --> 0:10:48,000
but we now approach every obstacle with a "So What. Now What?" attitude.

177
0:10:50.377,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And that brings me to my third and final slogan.

178
0:10:54.486,000 --> 0:10:55,000
(Laughter)

179
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
If nobody told you they loved you today,

180
0:11:00.678,000 --> 0:11:03,000
you remember I do, and I always will.

181
0:11:05.079,000 --> 0:11:06,000
My students have problems:

182
0:11:07.875,000 --> 0:11:11,000
social, emotional and economic problems

183
0:11:12.448,000 --> 0:11:13,000
you could never imagine.

184
0:11:15.056,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Some of them are parents themselves,

185
0:11:17.418,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and some are completely alone.

186
0:11:21.375,000 --> 0:11:24,000
If someone asked me my real secret

187
0:11:24.917,000 --> 0:11:27,000
for how I truly keep Strawberry Mansion moving forward,

188
0:11:29.405,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I would have to say that I love my students

189
0:11:32.935,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and I believe in their possibilities

190
0:11:35.427,000 --> 0:11:36,000
unconditionally.

191
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:39,000
When I look at them,

192
0:11:40.235,000 --> 0:11:42,000
I can only see what they can become,

193
0:11:43.869,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and that is because I am one of them.

194
0:11:48.542,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I grew up poor in North Philadelphia too.

195
0:11:52.261,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I know what it feels like to go to a school that's not a school.

196
0:11:58.184,000 --> 0:12:01,000
I know what it feels like to wonder

197
0:12:01.458,000 --> 0:12:04,000
if there's ever going to be any way out of poverty.

198
0:12:06.092,000 --> 0:12:08,000
But because of my amazing mother,

199
0:12:10.496,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I got the ability to dream

200
0:12:13.586,000 --> 0:12:15,000
despite the poverty that surrounded me.

201
0:12:17.161,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So --

202
0:12:18.383,000 --> 0:12:2,000
(Applause) --

203
0:12:20.855,000 --> 0:12:25,000
if I'm going to push my students

204
0:12:25.972,000 --> 0:12:27,000
toward their dream and their purpose in life,

205
0:12:28.769,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I've got to get to know who they are.

206
0:12:32.042,000 --> 0:12:34,000
So I have to spend time with them,

207
0:12:34.918,000 --> 0:12:36,000
so I manage the lunchroom every day.

208
0:12:37.342,000 --> 0:12:38,000
(Laughter)

209
0:12:38.655,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And while I'm there,

210
0:12:40.896,000 --> 0:12:44,000
I talk to them about deeply personal things,

211
0:12:45.83,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and when it's their birthday,

212
0:12:47.937,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I sing "Happy Birthday"

213
0:12:49.89,000 --> 0:12:51,000
even though I cannot sing at all.

214
0:12:52.06,000 --> 0:12:54,000
(Laughter)

215
0:12:54.116,000 --> 0:12:55,000
I often ask them,

216
0:12:55.864,000 --> 0:12:58,000
"Why do you want me to sing when I cannot sing at all?"

217
0:12:59.821,000 --> 0:13:,000
(Laughter)

218
0:13:01.683,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And they respond by saying,

219
0:13:04.284,000 --> 0:13:06,000
"Because we like feeling special."

220
0:13:08.259,000 --> 0:13:1,000
We hold monthly town hall meetings

221
0:13:11.611,000 --> 0:13:13,000
to listen to their concerns,

222
0:13:14.565,000 --> 0:13:17,000
to find out what is on their minds.

223
0:13:18.784,000 --> 0:13:23,000
They ask us questions like, "Why do we have to follow rules?"

224
0:13:24.255,000 --> 0:13:26,000
"Why are there so many consequences?"

225
0:13:27.168,000 --> 0:13:29,000
"Why can't we just do what we want to do?"

226
0:13:30.159,000 --> 0:13:32,000
(Laughter)

227
0:13:32.414,000 --> 0:13:35,000
They ask, and I answer each question honestly,

228
0:13:36.932,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and this exchange in listening helps to clear up any misconceptions.

229
0:13:43.86,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Every moment is a teachable moment.

230
0:13:48.965,000 --> 0:13:49,000
My reward,

231
0:13:51.359,000 --> 0:13:52,000
my reward

232
0:13:54.759,000 --> 0:13:58,000
for being non-negotiable in my rules and consequences

233
0:13:59.839,000 --> 0:14:,000
is their earned respect.

234
0:14:02.564,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I insist on it,

235
0:14:04.878,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and because of this, we can accomplish things together.

236
0:14:09.952,000 --> 0:14:12,000
They are clear about my expectations for them,

237
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and I repeat those expectations every day over the P.A. system.

238
0:14:19.656,000 --> 0:14:2,000
I remind them --

239
0:14:21.293,000 --> 0:14:23,000
(Laughter)

240
0:14:23.533,000 --> 0:14:26,000
I remind them of those core values

241
0:14:27.19,000 --> 0:14:31,000
of focus, tradition, excellence,

242
0:14:32.172,000 --> 0:14:34,000
integrity and perseverance,

243
0:14:35.133,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and I remind them every day

244
0:14:37.655,000 --> 0:14:4,000
how education can truly change their lives.

245
0:14:42.216,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And I end every announcement the same:

246
0:14:45.414,000 --> 0:14:48,000
"If nobody told you they loved you today,

247
0:14:49.291,000 --> 0:14:5,000
you remember I do,

248
0:14:51.056,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and I always will."

249
0:14:54.076,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Ashley's words

250
0:14:56.893,000 --> 0:14:58,000
of "Miss, Miss,

251
0:15:00.224,000 --> 0:15:02,000
this is not a school,"

252
0:15:03.064,000 --> 0:15:05,000
is forever etched in my mind.

253
0:15:06.354,000 --> 0:15:11,000
If we are truly going to make real progress

254
0:15:11.806,000 --> 0:15:12,000
in addressing poverty,

255
0:15:13.798,000 --> 0:15:15,000
then we have to make sure

256
0:15:16.442,000 --> 0:15:2,000
that every school that serves children in poverty

257
0:15:20.655,000 --> 0:15:22,000
is a real school,

258
0:15:23.284,000 --> 0:15:25,000
a school, a school --

259
0:15:25.563,000 --> 0:15:27,000
(Applause) --

260
0:15:29.458,000 --> 0:15:32,000
a school that provides them with knowledge

261
0:15:33.264,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and mental training to navigate the world around them.

262
0:15:38.112,000 --> 0:15:4,000
I do not know all the answers,

263
0:15:41.458,000 --> 0:15:46,000
but what I do know is for those of us who are privileged

264
0:15:47.5,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and have the responsibility of leading a school that serves children in poverty,

265
0:15:53.042,000 --> 0:15:55,000
we must truly lead,

266
0:15:55.292,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and when we are faced with unbelievable challenges,

267
0:15:58.941,000 --> 0:16:03,000
we must stop and ask ourselves, "So what. Now what?

268
0:16:04.75,000 --> 0:16:06,000
What are we going to do about it?"

269
0:16:08.06,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And as we lead,

270
0:16:10.063,000 --> 0:16:11,000
we must never forget

271
0:16:12.677,000 --> 0:16:15,000
that every single one of our students

272
0:16:15.917,000 --> 0:16:16,000
is just a child,

273
0:16:17.99,000 --> 0:16:21,000
often scared by what the world tells them they should be,

274
0:16:23.797,000 --> 0:16:28,000
and no matter what the rest of the world tells them they should be,

275
0:16:30.139,000 --> 0:16:33,000
we should always provide them with hope,

276
0:16:33.438,000 --> 0:16:35,000
our undivided attention,

277
0:16:36.656,000 --> 0:16:39,000
unwavering belief in their potential,

278
0:16:39.806,000 --> 0:16:41,000
consistent expectations,

279
0:16:42.303,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and we must tell them often,

280
0:16:45.117,000 --> 0:16:48,000
if nobody told them they loved them today,

281
0:16:48.717,000 --> 0:16:5,000
remember we do, and we always will.

282
0:16:51.844,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Thank you.

283
0:16:53.081,000 --> 0:16:56,000
(Applause)

284
0:17:04.058,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Thank you, Jesus.

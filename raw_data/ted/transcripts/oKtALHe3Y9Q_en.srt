1
0:00:12.739,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So it's 2006.

2
0:00:14.769,000 --> 0:00:16,000
My friend Harold Ford calls me.

3
0:00:16.899,000 --> 0:00:19,000
He's running for U.S. Senate in Tennessee,

4
0:00:20.564,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and he says, "Mellody, I desperately need some national press. Do you have any ideas?"

5
0:00:25.151,000 --> 0:00:26,000
So I had an idea. I called a friend

6
0:00:27.13,000 --> 0:00:28,000
who was in New York

7
0:00:28.282,000 --> 0:00:31,000
at one of the most successful media companies in the world,

8
0:00:31.671,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and she said, "Why don't we host

9
0:00:33.757,000 --> 0:00:35,000
an editorial board lunch for Harold?

10
0:00:36.003,000 --> 0:00:37,000
You come with him."

11
0:00:37.598,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Harold and I arrive in New York.

12
0:00:39.343,000 --> 0:00:41,000
We are in our best suits.

13
0:00:41.358,000 --> 0:00:43,000
We look like shiny new pennies.

14
0:00:43.573,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And we get to the receptionist, and we say,

15
0:00:46.094,000 --> 0:00:47,000
"We're here for the lunch."

16
0:00:47.474,000 --> 0:00:49,000
She motions for us to follow her.

17
0:00:49.678,000 --> 0:00:51,000
We walk through a series of corridors,

18
0:00:52.12,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and all of a sudden we find ourselves

19
0:00:53.374,000 --> 0:00:54,000
in a stark room,

20
0:00:55.04,000 --> 0:00:58,000
at which point she looks at us and she says,

21
0:00:58.13,000 --> 0:01:02,000
"Where are your uniforms?"

22
0:01:02.415,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Just as this happens,

23
0:01:03.661,000 --> 0:01:05,000
my friend rushes in.

24
0:01:05.99,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The blood drains from her face.

25
0:01:08.438,000 --> 0:01:1,000
There are literally no words, right?

26
0:01:10.82,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And I look at her, and I say,

27
0:01:11.839,000 --> 0:01:12,000
"Now, don't you think we need

28
0:01:13.729,000 --> 0:01:17,000
more than one black person in the U.S. Senate?"

29
0:01:17.8,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Now Harold and I --

30
0:01:19.828,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Applause) —

31
0:01:22.346,000 --> 0:01:25,000
we still laugh about that story,

32
0:01:25.435,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and in many ways, the moment caught me off guard,

33
0:01:28.871,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but deep, deep down inside,

34
0:01:31.891,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I actually wasn't surprised.

35
0:01:34.015,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And I wasn't surprised because of something

36
0:01:35.438,000 --> 0:01:38,000
my mother taught me about 30 years before.

37
0:01:38.574,000 --> 0:01:41,000
You see, my mother was ruthlessly realistic.

38
0:01:41.989,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I remember one day coming home from a birthday party

39
0:01:43.981,000 --> 0:01:44,000
where I was the only black kid invited,

40
0:01:45.82,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and instead of asking me the normal motherly questions

41
0:01:48.497,000 --> 0:01:5,000
like, "Did you have fun?" or "How was the cake?"

42
0:01:51.481,000 --> 0:01:53,000
my mother looked at me and she said,

43
0:01:53.658,000 --> 0:01:55,000
"How did they treat you?"

44
0:01:55.89,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I was seven. I did not understand.

45
0:01:58.657,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I mean, why would anyone treat me differently?

46
0:02:01.94,000 --> 0:02:02,000
But she knew.

47
0:02:03.065,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And she looked me right in the eye and she said,

48
0:02:05.737,000 --> 0:02:08,000
"They will not always treat you well."

49
0:02:08.912,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now, race is one of those topics in America

50
0:02:11.258,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that makes people extraordinarily uncomfortable.

51
0:02:14.736,000 --> 0:02:15,000
You bring it up at a dinner party

52
0:02:16.39,000 --> 0:02:17,000
or in a workplace environment,

53
0:02:18.035,000 --> 0:02:21,000
it is literally the conversational equivalent

54
0:02:21.215,000 --> 0:02:22,000
of touching the third rail.

55
0:02:23.09,000 --> 0:02:24,000
There is shock,

56
0:02:24.265,000 --> 0:02:26,000
followed by a long silence.

57
0:02:27.23,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And even coming here today,

58
0:02:28.884,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I told some friends and colleagues

59
0:02:30.035,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that I planned to talk about race,

60
0:02:31.601,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and they warned me, they told me, don't do it,

61
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that there'd be huge risks

62
0:02:36.147,000 --> 0:02:37,000
in me talking about this topic,

63
0:02:37.677,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that people might think I'm a militant black woman

64
0:02:40.168,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and I would ruin my career.

65
0:02:42.352,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And I have to tell you,

66
0:02:43.643,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I actually for a moment was a bit afraid.

67
0:02:46.1,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Then I realized,

68
0:02:48.17,000 --> 0:02:5,000
the first step to solving any problem

69
0:02:50.649,000 --> 0:02:51,000
is to not hide from it,

70
0:02:52.44,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and the first step to any form of action

71
0:02:56.422,000 --> 0:02:58,000
is awareness.

72
0:02:58.477,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And so I decided to actually talk about race.

73
0:03:01.917,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And I decided that if I came here and shared with you

74
0:03:04.79,000 --> 0:03:06,000
some of my experiences,

75
0:03:06.974,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that maybe we could all be a little less anxious

76
0:03:09.662,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and a little more bold

77
0:03:11.208,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in our conversations about race.

78
0:03:14.11,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Now I know there are people out there who will say

79
0:03:16.1,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that the election of Barack Obama meant

80
0:03:17.726,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that it was the end of racial discrimination

81
0:03:20.525,000 --> 0:03:22,000
for all eternity, right?

82
0:03:22.547,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But I work in the investment business,

83
0:03:24.19,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and we have a saying:

84
0:03:25.65,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The numbers do not lie.

85
0:03:27.705,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And here, there are significant,

86
0:03:30.319,000 --> 0:03:32,000
quantifiable racial disparities

87
0:03:33.04,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that cannot be ignored,

88
0:03:34.559,000 --> 0:03:37,000
in household wealth, household income,

89
0:03:38.142,000 --> 0:03:4,000
job opportunities, healthcare.

90
0:03:41.141,000 --> 0:03:43,000
One example from corporate America:

91
0:03:43.628,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Even though white men

92
0:03:45.633,000 --> 0:03:48,000
make up just 30 percent of the U.S. population,

93
0:03:49.424,000 --> 0:03:53,000
they hold 70 percent of all corporate board seats.

94
0:03:53.823,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Of the Fortune 250,

95
0:03:56.101,000 --> 0:03:59,000
there are only seven CEOs that are minorities,

96
0:03:59.944,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and of the thousands of publicly traded companies today, thousands,

97
0:04:04.21,000 --> 0:04:06,000
only two are chaired by black women,

98
0:04:07.036,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and you're looking at one of them,

99
0:04:08.841,000 --> 0:04:1,000
the same one who, not too long ago,

100
0:04:10.993,000 --> 0:04:12,000
was nearly mistaken for kitchen help.

101
0:04:13.85,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So that is a fact.

102
0:04:15.024,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Now I have this thought experiment

103
0:04:17.212,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that I play with myself, when I say,

104
0:04:19.739,000 --> 0:04:21,000
imagine if I walked you into a room

105
0:04:21.998,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and it was of a major corporation, like ExxonMobil,

106
0:04:25.257,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and every single person around the boardroom were black,

107
0:04:28.867,000 --> 0:04:3,000
you would think that were weird.

108
0:04:31.4,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But if I walked you into a Fortune 500 company,

109
0:04:34.204,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and everyone around the table is a white male,

110
0:04:36.327,000 --> 0:04:39,000
when will it be that we think that's weird too?

111
0:04:39.426,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And I know how we got here.

112
0:04:41.14,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Applause)

113
0:04:45.303,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I know how we got here.

114
0:04:47.071,000 --> 0:04:49,000
You know, there was institutionalized,

115
0:04:49.757,000 --> 0:04:52,000
at one time legalized, discrimination in our country.

116
0:04:52.866,000 --> 0:04:54,000
There's no question about it.

117
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
But still, as I grapple with this issue,

118
0:04:57.985,000 --> 0:04:59,000
my mother's question hangs in the air for me:

119
0:05:00.51,000 --> 0:05:02,000
How did they treat you?

120
0:05:02.593,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Now, I do not raise this issue to complain

121
0:05:05.069,000 --> 0:05:07,000
or in any way to elicit any kind of sympathy.

122
0:05:07.315,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I have succeeded in my life

123
0:05:09.298,000 --> 0:05:11,000
beyond my wildest expectations,

124
0:05:12.14,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and I have been treated well by people of all races

125
0:05:15.105,000 --> 0:05:17,000
more often than I have not.

126
0:05:17.341,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I tell the uniform story because it happened.

127
0:05:20.154,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I cite those statistics around corporate board diversity

128
0:05:22.774,000 --> 0:05:23,000
because they are real,

129
0:05:24.438,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and I stand here today

130
0:05:26.102,000 --> 0:05:28,000
talking about this issue of racial discrimination

131
0:05:28.692,000 --> 0:05:3,000
because I believe it threatens to rob

132
0:05:31.187,000 --> 0:05:34,000
another generation of all the opportunities

133
0:05:34.473,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that all of us want for all of our children,

134
0:05:37.058,000 --> 0:05:38,000
no matter what their color

135
0:05:38.821,000 --> 0:05:39,000
or where they come from.

136
0:05:40.62,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And I think it also threatens to hold back businesses.

137
0:05:44.198,000 --> 0:05:46,000
You see, researchers have coined this term

138
0:05:46.999,000 --> 0:05:47,000
"color blindness"

139
0:05:48.834,000 --> 0:05:5,000
to describe a learned behavior where we pretend

140
0:05:51.509,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that we don't notice race.

141
0:05:53.354,000 --> 0:05:55,000
If you happen to be surrounded by a bunch of people

142
0:05:55.514,000 --> 0:05:58,000
who look like you, that's purely accidental.

143
0:05:59.29,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Now, color blindness, in my view,

144
0:06:01.39,000 --> 0:06:03,000
doesn't mean that there's no racial discrimination,

145
0:06:04.248,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and there's fairness.

146
0:06:05.943,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It doesn't mean that at all. It doesn't ensure it.

147
0:06:08.09,000 --> 0:06:1,000
In my view, color blindness is very dangerous

148
0:06:10.488,000 --> 0:06:12,000
because it means we're ignoring the problem.

149
0:06:13.245,000 --> 0:06:15,000
There was a corporate study that said that,

150
0:06:15.775,000 --> 0:06:16,000
instead of avoiding race,

151
0:06:17.552,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the really smart corporations actually deal with it head on.

152
0:06:21.524,000 --> 0:06:23,000
They actually recognize that embracing diversity

153
0:06:24.308,000 --> 0:06:26,000
means recognizing all races,

154
0:06:27.307,000 --> 0:06:29,000
including the majority one.

155
0:06:29.669,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But I'll be the first one to tell you,

156
0:06:31.465,000 --> 0:06:33,000
this subject matter can be hard,

157
0:06:34.306,000 --> 0:06:38,000
awkward, uncomfortable -- but that's kind of the point.

158
0:06:38.358,000 --> 0:06:41,000
In the spirit of debunking racial stereotypes,

159
0:06:41.38,000 --> 0:06:43,000
the one that black people don't like to swim,

160
0:06:43.555,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I'm going to tell you how much I love to swim.

161
0:06:46.785,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I love to swim so much

162
0:06:49.072,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that as an adult, I swim with a coach.

163
0:06:51.204,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And one day my coach had me do a drill

164
0:06:54.041,000 --> 0:06:56,000
where I had to swim to one end of a 25-meter pool

165
0:06:56.652,000 --> 0:06:57,000
without taking a breath.

166
0:06:58.54,000 --> 0:07:,000
And every single time I failed,

167
0:07:00.681,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I had to start over.

168
0:07:02.018,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And I failed a lot.

169
0:07:03.531,000 --> 0:07:04,000
By the end, I got it, but when I got out of the pool,

170
0:07:05.398,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I was exasperated and tired and annoyed,

171
0:07:08.021,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and I said, "Why are we doing breath-holding exercises?"

172
0:07:11.959,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And my coach looked me at me, and he said, "Mellody,

173
0:07:14.125,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that was not a breath-holding exercise.

174
0:07:17.116,000 --> 0:07:19,000
That drill was to make you comfortable

175
0:07:19.465,000 --> 0:07:2,000
being uncomfortable,

176
0:07:21.258,000 --> 0:07:24,000
because that's how most of us spend our days."

177
0:07:24.389,000 --> 0:07:26,000
If we can learn to deal with our discomfort,

178
0:07:26.655,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and just relax into it,

179
0:07:28.689,000 --> 0:07:3,000
we'll have a better life.

180
0:07:30.913,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So I think it's time for us to be comfortable

181
0:07:33.466,000 --> 0:07:36,000
with the uncomfortable conversation about race:

182
0:07:36.712,000 --> 0:07:38,000
black, white, Asian, Hispanic,

183
0:07:39.388,000 --> 0:07:41,000
male, female, all of us,

184
0:07:41.661,000 --> 0:07:43,000
if we truly believe in equal rights

185
0:07:43.937,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and equal opportunity in America,

186
0:07:45.948,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I think we have to have real conversations

187
0:07:48.951,000 --> 0:07:49,000
about this issue.

188
0:07:50.203,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We cannot afford to be color blind.

189
0:07:52.975,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We have to be color brave.

190
0:07:56.222,000 --> 0:08:,000
We have to be willing, as teachers and parents

191
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and entrepreneurs and scientists,

192
0:08:02.09,000 --> 0:08:03,000
we have to be willing to have

193
0:08:03.373,000 --> 0:08:05,000
proactive conversations about race

194
0:08:06.21,000 --> 0:08:09,000
with honesty and understanding and courage,

195
0:08:09.349,000 --> 0:08:12,000
not because it's the right thing to do,

196
0:08:12.888,000 --> 0:08:14,000
but because it's the smart thing to do,

197
0:08:15.161,000 --> 0:08:17,000
because our businesses and our products

198
0:08:17.544,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and our science, our research,

199
0:08:19.598,000 --> 0:08:22,000
all of that will be better with greater diversity.

200
0:08:23.235,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Now, my favorite example of color bravery

201
0:08:26.19,000 --> 0:08:27,000
is a guy named John Skipper.

202
0:08:27.648,000 --> 0:08:28,000
He runs ESPN.

203
0:08:29.5,000 --> 0:08:31,000
He's a North Carolina native,

204
0:08:31.83,000 --> 0:08:34,000
quintessential Southern gentleman, white.

205
0:08:34.877,000 --> 0:08:36,000
He joined ESPN, which already had a culture

206
0:08:37.288,000 --> 0:08:39,000
of inclusion and diversity, but he took it up a notch.

207
0:08:40.061,000 --> 0:08:42,000
He demanded that every open position

208
0:08:42.649,000 --> 0:08:44,000
have a diverse slate of candidates.

209
0:08:45.599,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Now he says the senior people

210
0:08:47.398,000 --> 0:08:48,000
in the beginning bristled,

211
0:08:49.21,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and they would come to him and say,

212
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
"Do you want me to hire the minority,

213
0:08:53.868,000 --> 0:08:56,000
or do you want me to hire the best person for the job?"

214
0:08:57.486,000 --> 0:09:,000
And Skipper says his answers were always the same:

215
0:09:01.145,000 --> 0:09:02,000
"Yes."

216
0:09:02.82,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And by saying yes to diversity,

217
0:09:04.63,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I honestly believe that ESPN

218
0:09:06.992,000 --> 0:09:08,000
is the most valuable cable franchise in the world.

219
0:09:09.482,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I think that's a part of the secret sauce.

220
0:09:11.928,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Now I can tell you, in my own industry,

221
0:09:13.97,000 --> 0:09:15,000
at Ariel Investments, we actually view our diversity

222
0:09:16.145,000 --> 0:09:18,000
as a competitive advantage,

223
0:09:18.305,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and that advantage can extend way beyond business.

224
0:09:21.626,000 --> 0:09:23,000
There's a guy named Scott Page at the University of Michigan.

225
0:09:23.81,000 --> 0:09:24,000
He is the first person to develop

226
0:09:25.539,000 --> 0:09:28,000
a mathematical calculation for diversity.

227
0:09:28.579,000 --> 0:09:3,000
He says, if you're trying to solve a really hard problem,

228
0:09:30.87,000 --> 0:09:31,000
really hard,

229
0:09:32.031,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that you should have a diverse group of people,

230
0:09:34.86,000 --> 0:09:37,000
including those with diverse intellects.

231
0:09:37.87,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The example that he gives is the smallpox epidemic.

232
0:09:40.723,000 --> 0:09:42,000
When it was ravaging Europe,

233
0:09:43.648,000 --> 0:09:44,000
they brought together all these scientists,

234
0:09:45.028,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and they were stumped.

235
0:09:46.49,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And the beginnings of the cure to the disease

236
0:09:49.582,000 --> 0:09:51,000
came from the most unlikely source,

237
0:09:51.775,000 --> 0:09:55,000
a dairy farmer who noticed that the milkmaids

238
0:09:56.155,000 --> 0:09:57,000
were not getting smallpox.

239
0:09:58.064,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And the smallpox vaccination is bovine-based

240
0:10:01.418,000 --> 0:10:03,000
because of that dairy farmer.

241
0:10:03.82,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Now I'm sure you're sitting here and you're saying,

242
0:10:06.232,000 --> 0:10:08,000
I don't run a cable company,

243
0:10:08.327,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I don't run an investment firm,

244
0:10:10.449,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I am not a dairy farmer.

245
0:10:11.9,000 --> 0:10:12,000
What can I do?

246
0:10:13.35,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And I'm telling you, you can be color brave.

247
0:10:16.866,000 --> 0:10:17,000
If you're part of a hiring process

248
0:10:18.75,000 --> 0:10:19,000
or an admissions process,

249
0:10:20.39,000 --> 0:10:21,000
you can be color brave.

250
0:10:22.057,000 --> 0:10:24,000
If you are trying to solve a really hard problem,

251
0:10:24.901,000 --> 0:10:26,000
you can speak up and be color brave.

252
0:10:27.68,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Now I know people will say,

253
0:10:30.929,000 --> 0:10:32,000
but that doesn't add up to a lot,

254
0:10:33.079,000 --> 0:10:35,000
but I'm actually asking you to do something really simple:

255
0:10:36.05,000 --> 0:10:38,000
observe your environment,

256
0:10:38.268,000 --> 0:10:41,000
at work, at school, at home.

257
0:10:42.08,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I'm asking you to look at the people around you

258
0:10:44.429,000 --> 0:10:46,000
purposefully and intentionally.

259
0:10:47.05,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Invite people into your life

260
0:10:48.493,000 --> 0:10:5,000
who don't look like you, don't think like you,

261
0:10:51.329,000 --> 0:10:52,000
don't act like you,

262
0:10:52.624,000 --> 0:10:53,000
don't come from where you come from,

263
0:10:54.585,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and you might find that they will challenge your assumptions

264
0:10:57.235,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and make you grow as a person.

265
0:10:58.991,000 --> 0:11:,000
You might get powerful new insights

266
0:11:01.331,000 --> 0:11:02,000
from these individuals,

267
0:11:02.954,000 --> 0:11:05,000
or, like my husband, who happens to be white,

268
0:11:06.14,000 --> 0:11:08,000
you might learn that black people,

269
0:11:08.21,000 --> 0:11:09,000
men, women, children,

270
0:11:09.767,000 --> 0:11:11,000
we use body lotion every single day.

271
0:11:12.656,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Now, I also think that this is very important

272
0:11:17.278,000 --> 0:11:19,000
so that the next generation really understands

273
0:11:20.25,000 --> 0:11:21,000
that this progress will help them,

274
0:11:21.76,000 --> 0:11:24,000
because they're expecting us to be great role models.

275
0:11:24.894,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Now, I told you, my mother,

276
0:11:26.371,000 --> 0:11:27,000
she was ruthlessly realistic.

277
0:11:27.942,000 --> 0:11:3,000
She was an unbelievable role model.

278
0:11:31.182,000 --> 0:11:32,000
She was the kind of person

279
0:11:32.313,000 --> 0:11:33,000
who got to be the way she was

280
0:11:33.635,000 --> 0:11:34,000
because she was a single mom

281
0:11:35.611,000 --> 0:11:36,000
with six kids in Chicago.

282
0:11:37.283,000 --> 0:11:38,000
She was in the real estate business,

283
0:11:39.075,000 --> 0:11:41,000
where she worked extraordinarily hard

284
0:11:41.825,000 --> 0:11:44,000
but oftentimes had a hard time making ends meet.

285
0:11:45.093,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And that meant sometimes we got

286
0:11:46.94,000 --> 0:11:47,000
our phone disconnected,

287
0:11:48.32,000 --> 0:11:48,000
or our lights turned off,

288
0:11:49.188,000 --> 0:11:5,000
or we got evicted.

289
0:11:51.129,000 --> 0:11:52,000
When we got evicted, sometimes we lived

290
0:11:52.67,000 --> 0:11:53,000
in these small apartments that she owned,

291
0:11:54.476,000 --> 0:11:55,000
sometimes in only one or two rooms,

292
0:11:56.075,000 --> 0:11:57,000
because they weren't completed,

293
0:11:57.832,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and we would heat our bathwater on hot plates.

294
0:12:02.543,000 --> 0:12:04,000
But she never gave up hope, ever,

295
0:12:05.055,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and she never allowed us to give up hope either.

296
0:12:07.735,000 --> 0:12:08,000
This brutal pragmatism that she had,

297
0:12:09.312,000 --> 0:12:1,000
I mean, I was four and she told me,

298
0:12:11.106,000 --> 0:12:13,000
"Mommy is Santa." (Laughter)

299
0:12:13.429,000 --> 0:12:15,000
She was this brutal pragmatism.

300
0:12:15.912,000 --> 0:12:17,000
She taught me so many lessons,

301
0:12:18.285,000 --> 0:12:19,000
but the most important lesson

302
0:12:20.118,000 --> 0:12:23,000
was that every single day she told me,

303
0:12:23.344,000 --> 0:12:28,000
"Mellody, you can be anything."

304
0:12:28.68,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And because of those words,

305
0:12:30.538,000 --> 0:12:32,000
I would wake up at the crack of dawn,

306
0:12:32.643,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and because of those words,

307
0:12:34.459,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I would love school more than anything,

308
0:12:37.471,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and because of those words, when I was on a bus

309
0:12:39.404,000 --> 0:12:42,000
going to school, I dreamed the biggest dreams.

310
0:12:42.657,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And it's because of those words that I stand here right now

311
0:12:45.76,000 --> 0:12:46,000
full of passion,

312
0:12:47.716,000 --> 0:12:49,000
asking you to be brave for the kids

313
0:12:50.124,000 --> 0:12:52,000
who are dreaming those dreams today.

314
0:12:52.434,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Applause)

315
0:12:57.855,000 --> 0:13:01,000
You see, I want them to look at a CEO on television

316
0:13:02.044,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and say, "I can be like her,"

317
0:13:04.231,000 --> 0:13:06,000
or, "He looks like me."

318
0:13:06.738,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And I want them to know

319
0:13:08.479,000 --> 0:13:09,000
that anything is possible,

320
0:13:10.174,000 --> 0:13:11,000
that they can achieve the highest level

321
0:13:11.69,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that they ever imagined,

322
0:13:13.444,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that they will be welcome in any corporate boardroom,

323
0:13:16.539,000 --> 0:13:18,000
or they can lead any company.

324
0:13:19.43,000 --> 0:13:2,000
You see this idea of being the land

325
0:13:21.368,000 --> 0:13:22,000
of the free and the home of the brave,

326
0:13:23.042,000 --> 0:13:26,000
it's woven into the fabric of America.

327
0:13:26.49,000 --> 0:13:28,000
America, when we have a challenge,

328
0:13:28.498,000 --> 0:13:3,000
we take it head on, we don't shrink away from it.

329
0:13:31.374,000 --> 0:13:33,000
We take a stand. We show courage.

330
0:13:34.233,000 --> 0:13:36,000
So right now, what I'm asking you to do,

331
0:13:36.242,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I'm asking you to show courage.

332
0:13:38.22,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I'm asking you to be bold.

333
0:13:40.488,000 --> 0:13:41,000
As business leaders, I'm asking you

334
0:13:42.309,000 --> 0:13:44,000
not to leave anything on the table.

335
0:13:44.512,000 --> 0:13:48,000
As citizens, I'm asking you not to leave any child behind.

336
0:13:48.552,000 --> 0:13:5,000
I'm asking you not to be color blind,

337
0:13:51.007,000 --> 0:13:53,000
but to be color brave,

338
0:13:53.11,000 --> 0:13:56,000
so that every child knows that their future matters

339
0:13:56.267,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and their dreams are possible.

340
0:13:57.899,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Thank you.

341
0:14:00.429,000 --> 0:14:05,000
(Applause)

342
0:14:05.917,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. (Applause)

1
0:00:12.19,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So infectious diseases, right?

2
0:00:13.72,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Infectious diseases are still the main cause

3
0:00:15.87,000 --> 0:00:17,000
of human suffering and death around the world.

4
0:00:18.197,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Every year, millions of people die of diseases such as T.B., malaria, HIV,

5
0:00:23.367,000 --> 0:00:25,000
around the world and even in the United States.

6
0:00:25.713,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Every year, thousands of Americans die of seasonal flu.

7
0:00:29.319,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Now of course, humans, we are creative. Right?

8
0:00:31.474,000 --> 0:00:34,000
We have come up with ways to protect ourselves against these diseases.

9
0:00:34.799,000 --> 0:00:35,000
We have drugs and vaccines.

10
0:00:36.104,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And we're conscious -- we learn from our experiences

11
0:00:39.489,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and come up with creative solutions.

12
0:00:41.416,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We used to think we're alone in this, but now we know we're not.

13
0:00:44.481,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We're not the only medical doctors.

14
0:00:46.3,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Now we know that there's a lot of animals out there that can do it too.

15
0:00:49.706,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Most famous, perhaps, chimpanzees.

16
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Not so much different from us,

17
0:00:52.831,000 --> 0:00:54,000
they can use plants to treat their intestinal parasites.

18
0:00:55.696,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But the last few decades have shown us that other animals can do it too:

19
0:00:59.143,000 --> 0:01:02,000
elephants, porcupines, sheep, goats, you name it.

20
0:01:02.522,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And even more interesting than that is that recent discoveries are telling us

21
0:01:06.161,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that insects and other little animals with smaller brains can use medication too.

22
0:01:11.603,000 --> 0:01:13,000
The problem with infectious diseases, as we all know,

23
0:01:14.132,000 --> 0:01:15,000
is that pathogens continue to evolve,

24
0:01:16.081,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and a lot of the drugs that we have developed

25
0:01:18.317,000 --> 0:01:19,000
are losing their efficacy.

26
0:01:19.976,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And therefore, there is this great need to find new ways to discover drugs

27
0:01:24.209,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that we can use against our diseases.

28
0:01:26.113,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Now, I think that we should look at these animals,

29
0:01:28.667,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and we can learn from them how to treat our own diseases.

30
0:01:32.331,000 --> 0:01:36,000
As a biologist, I have been studying monarch butterflies for the last 10 years.

31
0:01:36.631,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Now, monarchs are extremely famous for their spectacular migrations

32
0:01:39.999,000 --> 0:01:42,000
from the U.S. and Canada down to Mexico every year,

33
0:01:43.109,000 --> 0:01:45,000
where millions of them come together,

34
0:01:45.129,000 --> 0:01:47,000
but it's not why I started studying them.

35
0:01:47.66,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I study monarchs because they get sick.

36
0:01:50.051,000 --> 0:01:52,000
They get sick like you. They get sick like me.

37
0:01:52.513,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And I think what they do can tell us a lot about drugs

38
0:01:55.2,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that we can develop for humans.

39
0:01:57.412,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Now, the parasites that monarchs get infected with

40
0:01:59.847,000 --> 0:02:02,000
are called ophryocystis elektroscirrha -- a mouthful.

41
0:02:03.726,000 --> 0:02:04,000
What they do is they produce spores,

42
0:02:05.492,000 --> 0:02:07,000
millions of spores on the outside of the butterfly

43
0:02:07.884,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that are shown as little specks in between the scales of the butterfly.

44
0:02:11.261,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And this is really detrimental to the monarch.

45
0:02:13.619,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It shortens their lifespan,

46
0:02:15.267,000 --> 0:02:17,000
it reduces their ability to fly,

47
0:02:17.372,000 --> 0:02:19,000
it can even kill them before they're even adults.

48
0:02:19.879,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Very detrimental parasite.

49
0:02:21.76,000 --> 0:02:25,000
As part of my job, I spend a lot of time in the greenhouse growing plants,

50
0:02:25.916,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and the reason for this is that monarchs are extremely picky eaters.

51
0:02:29.469,000 --> 0:02:3,000
They only eat milkweed as larvae.

52
0:02:31.464,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Luckily, there are several species of milkweed that they can use,

53
0:02:34.549,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and all these milkweeds have cardenolides in them.

54
0:02:36.905,000 --> 0:02:37,000
These are chemicals that are toxic.

55
0:02:38.699,000 --> 0:02:4,000
They're toxic to most animals, but not to monarchs.

56
0:02:41.094,000 --> 0:02:43,000
In fact, monarchs can take up the chemicals,

57
0:02:43.316,000 --> 0:02:45,000
put it in their own bodies, and it makes them toxic

58
0:02:45.724,000 --> 0:02:47,000
against their predators, such as birds.

59
0:02:48.003,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And what they do, then, is advertise this toxicity

60
0:02:50.377,000 --> 0:02:52,000
through their beautiful warning colorations

61
0:02:52.398,000 --> 0:02:54,000
with this orange, black and white.

62
0:02:54.476,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So what I did during my job is grow plants in the greenhouse,

63
0:02:58.348,000 --> 0:02:59,000
different ones, different milkweeds.

64
0:03:00.094,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Some were toxic, including the tropical milkweed,

65
0:03:02.848,000 --> 0:03:05,000
with very high concentrations of these cardenolides.

66
0:03:06.137,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And some were not toxic.

67
0:03:07.315,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And then I fed them to monarchs.

68
0:03:09.635,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Some of the monarchs were healthy. They had no disease.

69
0:03:12.258,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But some of the monarchs were sick,

70
0:03:14.033,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and what I found is that some of these milkweeds are medicinal,

71
0:03:17.056,000 --> 0:03:2,000
meaning they reduce the disease symptoms in the monarch butterflies,

72
0:03:20.293,000 --> 0:03:23,000
meaning these monarchs can live longer when they are infected

73
0:03:23.41,000 --> 0:03:24,000
when feeding on these medicinal plants.

74
0:03:25.324,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And when I found this, I had this idea,

75
0:03:28.035,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and a lot of people said it was a crazy idea,

76
0:03:30.343,000 --> 0:03:32,000
but I thought, what if monarchs can use this?

77
0:03:32.817,000 --> 0:03:35,000
What if they can use these plants as their own form of medicine?

78
0:03:35.876,000 --> 0:03:37,000
What if they can act as medical doctors?

79
0:03:38.828,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So my team and I started doing experiments.

80
0:03:40.854,000 --> 0:03:41,000
In the first types of experiments,

81
0:03:42.655,000 --> 0:03:44,000
we had caterpillars, and gave them a choice:

82
0:03:44.825,000 --> 0:03:46,000
medicinal milkweed versus non-medicinal milkweed.

83
0:03:47.566,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And then we measured how much they ate of each species over their lifetime.

84
0:03:51.186,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And the result, as so often in science, was boring:

85
0:03:54.2,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Fifty percent of their food was medicinal. Fifty percent was not.

86
0:03:58.451,000 --> 0:04:01,000
These caterpillars didn't do anything for their own welfare.

87
0:04:02.611,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So then we moved on to adult butterflies,

88
0:04:04.686,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and we started asking the question

89
0:04:06.577,000 --> 0:04:09,000
whether it's the mothers that can medicate their offspring.

90
0:04:09.735,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Can the mothers lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed

91
0:04:12.509,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that will make their future offspring less sick?

92
0:04:15.708,000 --> 0:04:17,000
We have done these experiments now over several years,

93
0:04:18.236,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and always get the same results.

94
0:04:20.024,000 --> 0:04:22,000
What we do is we put a monarch in a big cage,

95
0:04:22.186,000 --> 0:04:25,000
a medicinal plant on one side, a non-medicinal plant on the other side,

96
0:04:25.669,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and then we measure the number of eggs that the monarchs lay on each plant.

97
0:04:30.245,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And what we find when we do that is always the same.

98
0:04:33.354,000 --> 0:04:36,000
What we find is that the monarchs strongly prefer the medicinal milkweed.

99
0:04:36.947,000 --> 0:04:38,000
In other words, what these females are doing

100
0:04:39.048,000 --> 0:04:42,000
is they're laying 68 percent of their eggs in the medicinal milkweed.

101
0:04:42.392,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Intriguingly, what they do is they actually transmit the parasites

102
0:04:46.612,000 --> 0:04:47,000
when they're laying the eggs.

103
0:04:48.077,000 --> 0:04:49,000
They cannot prevent this.

104
0:04:49.512,000 --> 0:04:5,000
They can also not medicate themselves.

105
0:04:51.443,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But what these experiments tell us

106
0:04:53.68,000 --> 0:04:57,000
is that these monarchs, these mothers, can lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed

107
0:04:58.509,000 --> 0:05:,000
that will make their future offspring less sick.

108
0:05:03.058,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Now, this is a really important discovery, I think,

109
0:05:05.581,000 --> 0:05:07,000
not just because it tells us something cool about nature,

110
0:05:08.415,000 --> 0:05:11,000
but also because it may tell us something more about how we should find drugs.

111
0:05:12.101,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now, these are animals that are very small

112
0:05:14.101,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and we tend to think of them as very simple.

113
0:05:16.2,000 --> 0:05:17,000
They have tiny little brains,

114
0:05:17.757,000 --> 0:05:19,000
yet they can do this very sophisticated medication.

115
0:05:20.811,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Now, we know that even today, most of our drugs

116
0:05:23.389,000 --> 0:05:25,000
derive from natural products, including plants,

117
0:05:26.148,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and in indigenous cultures,

118
0:05:27.76,000 --> 0:05:29,000
traditional healers often look at animals to find new drugs.

119
0:05:30.595,000 --> 0:05:33,000
In this way, elephants have told us how to treat stomach upset,

120
0:05:34.002,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and porcupines have told people how to treat bloody diarrhea.

121
0:05:37.291,000 --> 0:05:39,000
What I think is important, though, is to move beyond

122
0:05:39.946,000 --> 0:05:42,000
these large-brained mammals and give these guys more credit,

123
0:05:43.754,000 --> 0:05:45,000
these simple animals, these insects that we tend to think of

124
0:05:46.656,000 --> 0:05:49,000
as very, very simple with tiny little brains.

125
0:05:49.905,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The discovery that these animals can also use medication

126
0:05:53.876,000 --> 0:05:55,000
opens up completely new avenues,

127
0:05:56.355,000 --> 0:06:,000
and I think that maybe one day, we will be treating human diseases

128
0:06:01.069,000 --> 0:06:04,000
with drugs that were first discovered by butterflies,

129
0:06:04.178,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and I think that is an amazing opportunity worth pursuing.

130
0:06:08.153,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Thank you so much.

131
0:06:10.316,000 --> 0:06:14,000
(Applause)

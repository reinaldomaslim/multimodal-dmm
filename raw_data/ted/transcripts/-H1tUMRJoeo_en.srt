1
0:00:11.809,000 --> 0:00:16,000
all life every living thing ever has

2
0:00:16.049,000 --> 0:00:2,000
been built according to the information

3
0:00:17.73,000 --> 0:00:22,000
in DNA what does that mean well it means

4
0:00:20.82,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that just as the English language is

5
0:00:22.89,000 --> 0:00:25,000
made up of alphabetic letters that when

6
0:00:24.84,000 --> 0:00:27,000
combined into words allow me to tell you

7
0:00:26.73,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the story I'm going to tell you today

8
0:00:28.22,000 --> 0:00:33,000
DNA is made up of genetic letters that

9
0:00:30.779,000 --> 0:00:35,000
when combined into genes allow cells to

10
0:00:33.66,000 --> 0:00:37,000
produce proteins strings of amino acids

11
0:00:36.149,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that fold up into complex structures

12
0:00:37.71,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that perform the functions that allow a

13
0:00:39.329,000 --> 0:00:43,000
cell to do what it does to tell its

14
0:00:41.46,000 --> 0:00:45,000
stories the English alphabet has 26

15
0:00:44.309,000 --> 0:00:47,000
letters and the genetic alphabet has

16
0:00:45.93,000 --> 0:00:47,000
four they're pretty famous maybe you've

17
0:00:47.67,000 --> 0:00:52,000
heard of them they're often just

18
0:00:48.78,000 --> 0:00:53,000
referred to as GC a and T but it's

19
0:00:52.829,000 --> 0:00:56,000
remarkable that all the diversity of

20
0:00:54.719,000 --> 0:00:59,000
life is the result of for genetic

21
0:00:57.539,000 --> 0:01:01,000
letters imagine what it would be like if

22
0:01:00.449,000 --> 0:01:04,000
the English alphabet had four letters

23
0:01:02.48,000 --> 0:01:08,000
what sort of stories would you be able

24
0:01:04.769,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to tell what if the genetic alphabet had

25
0:01:08.58,000 --> 0:01:13,000
more letters would life with more

26
0:01:12.21,000 --> 0:01:17,000
letters be able to tell different

27
0:01:13.59,000 --> 0:01:19,000
stories maybe even more interesting ones

28
0:01:17.54,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in 1999 my lab at the Scripps Research

29
0:01:20.4,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Institute in La Jolla California started

30
0:01:22.68,000 --> 0:01:25,000
working on this question with the goal

31
0:01:24.15,000 --> 0:01:28,000
of creating living organisms with DNA

32
0:01:26.61,000 --> 0:01:3,000
made up of a six-letter genetic alphabet

33
0:01:28.35,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the four natural letters plus two

34
0:01:31.079,000 --> 0:01:36,000
additional new man-made letters such an

35
0:01:35.52,000 --> 0:01:38,000
organism would be the first radically

36
0:01:37.02,000 --> 0:01:41,000
altered form of life ever created it

37
0:01:39.39,000 --> 0:01:43,000
would be a semi synthetic form of life

38
0:01:41.159,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that stores more information than life

39
0:01:44.009,000 --> 0:01:49,000
ever has before it would be able to make

40
0:01:46.92,000 --> 0:01:5,000
new proteins proteins built from more

41
0:01:49.079,000 --> 0:01:53,000
than the 20 normal amino acids that are

42
0:01:51.06,000 --> 0:01:57,000
usually used to build proteins what sort

43
0:01:53.909,000 --> 0:01:58,000
of stories could that lifestyle with the

44
0:01:57.6,000 --> 0:02:,000
power of synthetic chemistry and

45
0:01:59.07,000 --> 0:02:03,000
molecular biology and just under 20

46
0:02:01.02,000 --> 0:02:04,000
years of work we created bacteria with

47
0:02:03.09,000 --> 0:02:07,000
six-letter DNA let me tell you how we

48
0:02:04.979,000 --> 0:02:08,000
did it all you have to remember from

49
0:02:07.649,000 --> 0:02:1,000
your high school biology is that the

50
0:02:09.239,000 --> 0:02:13,000
four natural letters pair together to

51
0:02:11.069,000 --> 0:02:16,000
form two base pairs G pairs with C and

52
0:02:13.86,000 --> 0:02:18,000
eight pairs with T so to create our new

53
0:02:16.319,000 --> 0:02:2,000
letters we synthesized hundreds of new

54
0:02:18.87,000 --> 0:02:21,000
candidates new candidate letters in exam

55
0:02:20.92,000 --> 0:02:23,000
their abilities to selectively pair with

56
0:02:22.51,000 --> 0:02:26,000
each other and after about 15 years of

57
0:02:24.91,000 --> 0:02:28,000
work we found two that paired together

58
0:02:27.069,000 --> 0:02:31,000
really well at least on a test tube they

59
0:02:29.68,000 --> 0:02:33,000
have complicated names but let's just

60
0:02:31.87,000 --> 0:02:35,000
call them X and y the next thing we

61
0:02:34.51,000 --> 0:02:37,000
needed to do was find a way to get x and

62
0:02:36.22,000 --> 0:02:39,000
y in the cells and eventually we found

63
0:02:38.23,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that a protein that does something

64
0:02:39.43,000 --> 0:02:43,000
similar in algae worked in our bacteria

65
0:02:41.68,000 --> 0:02:45,000
so the final thing that we needed to do

66
0:02:43.93,000 --> 0:02:48,000
was to show that with x and y provided

67
0:02:46.239,000 --> 0:02:52,000
cells could grow and divide and hold on

68
0:02:49.15,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to x and y in their DNA everything that

69
0:02:52.39,000 --> 0:02:55,000
we've done up to then took longer than I

70
0:02:54.37,000 --> 0:02:57,000
had hoped I'm actually a really

71
0:02:55.66,000 --> 0:02:59,000
impatient person but this the most

72
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
important step worked faster than I

73
0:03:00.4,000 --> 0:03:05,000
dreamed

74
0:03:01.29,000 --> 0:03:08,000
basically immediately on a weekend in

75
0:03:05.5,000 --> 0:03:1,000
2014 a graduate student in my lab blew

76
0:03:08.319,000 --> 0:03:12,000
bacteria with six-letter DNA let me take

77
0:03:11.2,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the opportunity to introduce you to them

78
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:18,000
right now this is an actual picture of

79
0:03:14.41,000 --> 0:03:22,000
them these are the first semi synthetic

80
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
organisms so bacteria was six-letter DNA

81
0:03:23.08,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that's really cool right well maybe some

82
0:03:25.329,000 --> 0:03:29,000
of you are still wondering why so let me

83
0:03:28.12,000 --> 0:03:31,000
tell you a little bit more about some of

84
0:03:29.38,000 --> 0:03:33,000
our motivations both conceptual and

85
0:03:31.269,000 --> 0:03:35,000
practical conceptually people have

86
0:03:34.03,000 --> 0:03:37,000
thought about life what it is what makes

87
0:03:35.89,000 --> 0:03:38,000
it different from things that are not

88
0:03:37.03,000 --> 0:03:41,000
alive since people have had thoughts

89
0:03:39.15,000 --> 0:03:43,000
many have interpreted life is being

90
0:03:41.62,000 --> 0:03:44,000
perfect and this was taken as evidence

91
0:03:43.69,000 --> 0:03:47,000
of a creator living things are different

92
0:03:45.459,000 --> 0:03:49,000
because a god breathed life into them

93
0:03:47.76,000 --> 0:03:5,000
others have sought a more scientific

94
0:03:50.079,000 --> 0:03:53,000
explanation but I think it's fair to say

95
0:03:51.489,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that they still consider the molecules

96
0:03:53.23,000 --> 0:03:56,000
of life to be special I mean evolutions

97
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:59,000
been optimizing them for billions of

98
0:03:56.68,000 --> 0:04:,000
years right whatever perspective you

99
0:03:59.29,000 --> 0:04:02,000
take it would seem pretty impossible for

100
0:04:00.94,000 --> 0:04:03,000
chemists to come in and build new parts

101
0:04:02.62,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that function within and alongside the

102
0:04:04.66,000 --> 0:04:08,000
natural molecules of life without

103
0:04:06.85,000 --> 0:04:11,000
somehow really screwing everything up

104
0:04:09.569,000 --> 0:04:14,000
but just how perfectly created or

105
0:04:12.22,000 --> 0:04:17,000
evolved are we just how special are the

106
0:04:14.799,000 --> 0:04:18,000
molecules of life these questions have

107
0:04:17.32,000 --> 0:04:21,000
been impossible to even ask because

108
0:04:18.91,000 --> 0:04:22,000
we've had nothing to compare life to now

109
0:04:22.24,000 --> 0:04:25,000
for the first time our work suggests

110
0:04:23.35,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that maybe the molecules of life aren't

111
0:04:25.419,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that special maybe life as we know it

112
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
isn't the only way it could be maybe

113
0:04:31.21,000 --> 0:04:33,000
we're not the only solution maybe not

114
0:04:32.77,000 --> 0:04:37,000
even the best so

115
0:04:33.79,000 --> 0:04:39,000
just a solution these questions address

116
0:04:38.56,000 --> 0:04:41,000
fundamental issues about life but maybe

117
0:04:40.54,000 --> 0:04:44,000
they seem a little esoteric so what

118
0:04:41.98,000 --> 0:04:45,000
about practical motivations well we want

119
0:04:44.89,000 --> 0:04:47,000
to explore what sort of new stories life

120
0:04:46.9,000 --> 0:04:49,000
with an expanded vocabulary could tell

121
0:04:48.58,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and remember stories here are the

122
0:04:50.41,000 --> 0:04:53,000
proteins that a cell produces and the

123
0:04:52.21,000 --> 0:04:55,000
functions they have so what sort of new

124
0:04:54.34,000 --> 0:04:58,000
proteins with new types of functions

125
0:04:56.02,000 --> 0:05:,000
could our semi synthetic organisms make

126
0:04:58.54,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and maybe even use well we have a couple

127
0:05:00.97,000 --> 0:05:05,000
of things in mind the first is to get

128
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:08,000
the cells to make proteins for us for

129
0:05:06.55,000 --> 0:05:1,000
our use the proteins are being used

130
0:05:08.74,000 --> 0:05:12,000
today for an increasingly broad range of

131
0:05:10.63,000 --> 0:05:13,000
different applications from materials

132
0:05:12.88,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that protect soldiers from injury to

133
0:05:14.5,000 --> 0:05:18,000
devices that detect dangerous compounds

134
0:05:16.57,000 --> 0:05:2,000
but at least to me the most exciting

135
0:05:18.79,000 --> 0:05:22,000
application is protein drugs despite

136
0:05:21.4,000 --> 0:05:25,000
being relatively new protein drugs have

137
0:05:23.14,000 --> 0:05:27,000
already revolutionized medicine and for

138
0:05:25.72,000 --> 0:05:28,000
example insulin is a protein you've

139
0:05:27.97,000 --> 0:05:3,000
probably heard of it and it's

140
0:05:29.02,000 --> 0:05:33,000
manufactured as a drug that's completely

141
0:05:30.97,000 --> 0:05:34,000
changed how we treat diabetes but the

142
0:05:33.64,000 --> 0:05:36,000
problem is is that proteins are really

143
0:05:35.11,000 --> 0:05:38,000
hard to make and the only practical way

144
0:05:37.63,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to get them is to get cells to make them

145
0:05:38.95,000 --> 0:05:43,000
for you so of course with natural cells

146
0:05:42.58,000 --> 0:05:45,000
you can only get them to make proteins

147
0:05:44.68,000 --> 0:05:47,000
with the natural amino acids and so the

148
0:05:46.54,000 --> 0:05:49,000
properties those proteins can have the

149
0:05:48.49,000 --> 0:05:52,000
applications they could be developed for

150
0:05:50.35,000 --> 0:05:54,000
must be limited by the nature of those

151
0:05:52.66,000 --> 0:05:56,000
amino acids that the proteins built from

152
0:05:54.55,000 --> 0:05:58,000
so here they are the twenty normal amino

153
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
acids that are strung together to make a

154
0:05:58.6,000 --> 0:06:01,000
protein and I think you can see they're

155
0:05:59.98,000 --> 0:06:02,000
not that different looking they don't

156
0:06:02.05,000 --> 0:06:05,000
bring that many different functions they

157
0:06:03.73,000 --> 0:06:06,000
don't make that many different functions

158
0:06:05.05,000 --> 0:06:08,000
available compare that with the small

159
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:11,000
molecules that synthetic chemists make

160
0:06:08.74,000 --> 0:06:12,000
as drugs now they're much simpler than

161
0:06:11.68,000 --> 0:06:14,000
proteins but they're routinely built

162
0:06:13.3,000 --> 0:06:16,000
from a much broader range of diverse

163
0:06:15.1,000 --> 0:06:17,000
things don't worry about the molecular

164
0:06:16.51,000 --> 0:06:2,000
details but I think you can see how

165
0:06:18.01,000 --> 0:06:21,000
different they are and in fact it's

166
0:06:20.77,000 --> 0:06:24,000
their differences that make them great

167
0:06:21.91,000 --> 0:06:26,000
drugs to treat different diseases so

168
0:06:24.94,000 --> 0:06:28,000
it's really provocative to wonder what

169
0:06:27.55,000 --> 0:06:3,000
sort of new protein drugs you could

170
0:06:29.32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
develop if you could build proteins from

171
0:06:31.03,000 --> 0:06:37,000
more diverse things so can we get our

172
0:06:34.54,000 --> 0:06:38,000
semi synthetic organism to make proteins

173
0:06:37.06,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that include new and different amino

174
0:06:38.65,000 --> 0:06:41,000
acids maybe amino acids selected to

175
0:06:40.6,000 --> 0:06:45,000
confer the protein with some desired

176
0:06:42.25,000 --> 0:06:47,000
property or function for example many

177
0:06:46.21,000 --> 0:06:49,000
proteins just aren't

178
0:06:47.41,000 --> 0:06:51,000
when you inject them into people they're

179
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
rapidly degraded or eliminated and to

180
0:06:51.7,000 --> 0:06:55,000
stop them from being drugs what if we

181
0:06:54.43,000 --> 0:06:58,000
could make proteins with new amino acids

182
0:06:56.2,000 --> 0:07:,000
with things attached to them that

183
0:06:58.57,000 --> 0:07:02,000
protect them from their environment that

184
0:07:00.43,000 --> 0:07:03,000
protect them from from being degraded or

185
0:07:03.04,000 --> 0:07:08,000
eliminated so that they could be better

186
0:07:04.36,000 --> 0:07:1,000
drugs could we make proteins with little

187
0:07:08.86,000 --> 0:07:13,000
fingers attached that specifically grab

188
0:07:10.99,000 --> 0:07:14,000
on to other molecules many small

189
0:07:14.11,000 --> 0:07:17,000
molecules failed during development as

190
0:07:15.97,000 --> 0:07:18,000
drugs because they just weren't specific

191
0:07:17.65,000 --> 0:07:2,000
enough to find their target in the

192
0:07:19.06,000 --> 0:07:22,000
complex environment of human body so

193
0:07:21.46,000 --> 0:07:24,000
could we take those molecules and make

194
0:07:22.93,000 --> 0:07:27,000
them parts of new amino acids that when

195
0:07:25.3,000 --> 0:07:31,000
incorporated into a protein are guided

196
0:07:28.51,000 --> 0:07:33,000
by that protein to their target I

197
0:07:31.59,000 --> 0:07:35,000
started a biotech company called synth

198
0:07:33.91,000 --> 0:07:37,000
racks synth X stands for synthetic

199
0:07:35.77,000 --> 0:07:38,000
organism with an X added at the end

200
0:07:38.08,000 --> 0:07:42,000
because that's what you do with biotech

201
0:07:39.43,000 --> 0:07:44,000
companies synth Rex is working closely

202
0:07:43.06,000 --> 0:07:47,000
with my lab and they're interested at a

203
0:07:45.04,000 --> 0:07:49,000
you know in a protein that recognizes a

204
0:07:47.62,000 --> 0:07:51,000
certain receptor on the surface of human

205
0:07:49.36,000 --> 0:07:53,000
cells but the problem is is that it also

206
0:07:51.88,000 --> 0:07:55,000
recognizes another receptor on the

207
0:07:53.65,000 --> 0:07:58,000
surface of those same cells and that

208
0:07:56.02,000 --> 0:08:,000
makes it toxic so could we produce a

209
0:07:58.69,000 --> 0:08:01,000
variant of that protein where the part

210
0:08:00.58,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that interacts with that second bad

211
0:08:02.29,000 --> 0:08:06,000
receptor is shielded blocked by

212
0:08:04.9,000 --> 0:08:06,000
something like a big umbrella so that

213
0:08:06.46,000 --> 0:08:1,000
the protein only interacts with that

214
0:08:07.81,000 --> 0:08:12,000
first good receptor doing that would be

215
0:08:11.35,000 --> 0:08:14,000
really difficult or impossible to do

216
0:08:12.85,000 --> 0:08:15,000
with the normal amino acids but not with

217
0:08:14.53,000 --> 0:08:2,000
amino acids that are specifically

218
0:08:15.94,000 --> 0:08:22,000
designed for that purpose so getting our

219
0:08:21.1,000 --> 0:08:24,000
semi-synthetic cells to act as little

220
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
factories to produce better protein

221
0:08:24.73,000 --> 0:08:27,000
drugs isn't the only potentially really

222
0:08:26.41,000 --> 0:08:29,000
interesting application because remember

223
0:08:28.39,000 --> 0:08:33,000
it's the proteins that allow cells to do

224
0:08:30.13,000 --> 0:08:35,000
what they do so if we're making if we

225
0:08:33.789,000 --> 0:08:35,000
have cells that make new proteins with

226
0:08:35.2,000 --> 0:08:39,000
new functions could we get them to do

227
0:08:36.76,000 --> 0:08:4,000
things that natural cells can't do for

228
0:08:39.4,000 --> 0:08:43,000
example could we develop semi synthetic

229
0:08:41.229,000 --> 0:08:46,000
organisms that when injected into a

230
0:08:43.99,000 --> 0:08:47,000
person seek out cancer cells and only

231
0:08:46.69,000 --> 0:08:5,000
when they find them secrete a toxic

232
0:08:48.34,000 --> 0:08:52,000
protein that kills them could create

233
0:08:51.01,000 --> 0:08:55,000
pect area that eat different kinds of

234
0:08:53.14,000 --> 0:08:56,000
oil maybe to clean up an oil spill these

235
0:08:55.48,000 --> 0:08:57,000
are just a couple of the types of

236
0:08:57.04,000 --> 0:09:,000
stories that we're gonna see if life

237
0:08:58.3,000 --> 0:09:02,000
with an expanded vocabulary can tell so

238
0:09:00.85,000 --> 0:09:03,000
sounds great right injecting

239
0:09:02.889,000 --> 0:09:05,000
semi-synthetic organisms and the people

240
0:09:04.75,000 --> 0:09:07,000
dumping millions and millions of gallons

241
0:09:06.819,000 --> 0:09:1,000
of our bacteria into the ocean or out on

242
0:09:08.74,000 --> 0:09:12,000
your favorite beach oh wait a minute

243
0:09:10.959,000 --> 0:09:15,000
actually sounds really scary this this

244
0:09:13.149,000 --> 0:09:17,000
dinosaur is really scary but here's the

245
0:09:16.93,000 --> 0:09:2,000
catch

246
0:09:17.37,000 --> 0:09:22,000
our semi-synthetic organisms in order to

247
0:09:20.98,000 --> 0:09:25,000
survive need to be fed the chemical

248
0:09:23.35,000 --> 0:09:27,000
precursors of x and y x and y are

249
0:09:26.35,000 --> 0:09:3,000
completely different than anything that

250
0:09:28.18,000 --> 0:09:33,000
exists in nature cells just don't have

251
0:09:31.06,000 --> 0:09:35,000
them or the ability to make them so when

252
0:09:34.029,000 --> 0:09:36,000
we prepare them when we grow them up in

253
0:09:35.709,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the controlled environment of lab we can

254
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:41,000
feed them lots of the unnatural food

255
0:09:38.769,000 --> 0:09:43,000
then when we deploy them in a person or

256
0:09:41.829,000 --> 0:09:45,000
out on a beach where they no longer have

257
0:09:44.05,000 --> 0:09:48,000
access to that special food they can

258
0:09:46.36,000 --> 0:09:5,000
grow for a little they can survive for a

259
0:09:48.37,000 --> 0:09:52,000
little maybe just long enough to perform

260
0:09:50.44,000 --> 0:09:54,000
some intended function but then they

261
0:09:53.11,000 --> 0:09:57,000
start to run out of the food they start

262
0:09:55.209,000 --> 0:10:,000
to starve they starve to death and they

263
0:09:57.519,000 --> 0:10:02,000
just disappear so not only could we get

264
0:10:00.519,000 --> 0:10:03,000
life to tell news stories we get to tell

265
0:10:02.529,000 --> 0:10:07,000
life when and where to tell those

266
0:10:04.269,000 --> 0:10:1,000
stories at the beginning of this talk I

267
0:10:08.319,000 --> 0:10:12,000
told you that we reported in 2014 the

268
0:10:10.81,000 --> 0:10:13,000
creation of semi synthetic organisms

269
0:10:12.49,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that store more information x and y in

270
0:10:14.649,000 --> 0:10:18,000
their DNA but all the motivations that

271
0:10:17.05,000 --> 0:10:21,000
we just talked about require cells to

272
0:10:19.389,000 --> 0:10:23,000
use x and y to make proteins so we

273
0:10:21.639,000 --> 0:10:25,000
started working on that within a couple

274
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
years we showed that the cells could

275
0:10:25.899,000 --> 0:10:31,000
take DNA with x and y and copy it into

276
0:10:28.12,000 --> 0:10:34,000
RNA the working copy of DNA and late

277
0:10:31.99,000 --> 0:10:35,000
last year we showed that they could then

278
0:10:34.3,000 --> 0:10:39,000
use x and y to make proteins here they

279
0:10:36.85,000 --> 0:10:4,000
are the stars of the show the first

280
0:10:39.639,000 --> 0:10:43,000
fully functional semi synthetic

281
0:10:41.829,000 --> 0:10:43,000
organisms

282
0:10:49.24,000 --> 0:10:53,000
these cells are green because they're

283
0:10:51.44,000 --> 0:10:54,000
making a protein that glows green it's a

284
0:10:53.87,000 --> 0:10:56,000
pretty famous protein actually from

285
0:10:55.25,000 --> 0:10:59,000
jellyfish that a lot of people use in

286
0:10:56.99,000 --> 0:10:59,000
its natural form because it's easy to

287
0:10:59.3,000 --> 0:11:02,000
see that you made it

288
0:11:00.46,000 --> 0:11:04,000
but within every one of these proteins

289
0:11:02.75,000 --> 0:11:08,000
there's a new amino acid that natural

290
0:11:05.24,000 --> 0:11:14,000
life can't build proteins with every

291
0:11:09.65,000 --> 0:11:16,000
living cell every living cell ever has

292
0:11:14.3,000 --> 0:11:19,000
made every one of its proteins using a

293
0:11:16.97,000 --> 0:11:21,000
four-letter genetic alphabet these cells

294
0:11:20.21,000 --> 0:11:25,000
are living and growing and making

295
0:11:22.52,000 --> 0:11:28,000
protein with a six letter alphabet these

296
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
are a new form of life this is a semi

297
0:11:29.3,000 --> 0:11:34,000
synthetic form of life so what about the

298
0:11:32.42,000 --> 0:11:35,000
future my labs already working on

299
0:11:34.76,000 --> 0:11:37,000
expanding the genetic alphabet of other

300
0:11:36.29,000 --> 0:11:39,000
cells including human cells and we're

301
0:11:38.69,000 --> 0:11:42,000
getting ready to start working on more

302
0:11:40.13,000 --> 0:11:46,000
complex organisms think semi-synthetic

303
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
worms the last thing i want to say to

304
0:11:46.67,000 --> 0:11:5,000
you the most important thing that i want

305
0:11:48.35,000 --> 0:11:54,000
to say to you is that the time of semi

306
0:11:50.78,000 --> 0:11:54,000
synthetic life is here thank you

307
0:12:02.61,000 --> 0:12:1,000
I mean this Freud this is so remarkable

308
0:12:07.32,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I I just wanted to ask you what are the

309
0:12:11.13,000 --> 0:12:16,000
implications of your work for how we

310
0:12:13.98,000 --> 0:12:18,000
should think about the possibilities for

311
0:12:16.62,000 --> 0:12:2,000
life like in the universe elsewhere just

312
0:12:19.62,000 --> 0:12:22,000
it just seems like so much of life is

313
0:12:20.97,000 --> 0:12:23,000
based or so much of our assumptions are

314
0:12:23.459,000 --> 0:12:26,000
based on the fact that it's of course

315
0:12:24.779,000 --> 0:12:28,000
it's got to be DNA but is the

316
0:12:27.12,000 --> 0:12:32,000
possibility space of self-replicating

317
0:12:29.24,000 --> 0:12:34,000
molecules much bigger than DNA even just

318
0:12:32.91,000 --> 0:12:35,000
DNA with six letters they absolutely I

319
0:12:34.89,000 --> 0:12:36,000
think that's right and I think what were

320
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:4,000
what our work has shown as I mentioned I

321
0:12:37.86,000 --> 0:12:42,000
think that there's been always this

322
0:12:40.519,000 --> 0:12:45,000
prejudice that sort of we're perfect

323
0:12:43.2,000 --> 0:12:47,000
we're optimal God created us this way

324
0:12:45.57,000 --> 0:12:49,000
evolution perfected us this way we've

325
0:12:48.12,000 --> 0:12:52,000
made molecules that work right alongside

326
0:12:49.95,000 --> 0:12:54,000
the natural ones and I think that

327
0:12:53.04,000 --> 0:12:57,000
suggests that any any molecules that

328
0:12:55.86,000 --> 0:12:58,000
obey the fundamental laws of chemistry

329
0:12:57.87,000 --> 0:13:,000
and physics then you can optimize them

330
0:12:59.399,000 --> 0:13:02,000
could do the things that the natural

331
0:13:01.23,000 --> 0:13:04,000
molecules of life do there's nothing

332
0:13:02.43,000 --> 0:13:07,000
magic there and I think that it suggests

333
0:13:05.01,000 --> 0:13:09,000
that life could evolve many different

334
0:13:07.44,000 --> 0:13:11,000
ways may be similar to us with other

335
0:13:09.69,000 --> 0:13:15,000
types of DNA may be things without DNA

336
0:13:11.61,000 --> 0:13:17,000
at all I mean in your mind how like how

337
0:13:15.899,000 --> 0:13:18,000
big might that possibility space be do

338
0:13:17.94,000 --> 0:13:2,000
we even know of most things gonna look

339
0:13:19.589,000 --> 0:13:21,000
something like a DNA more I color them

340
0:13:21.029,000 --> 0:13:24,000
I'm saying really radically different

341
0:13:22.41,000 --> 0:13:25,000
that can still sell for produce and

342
0:13:24.449,000 --> 0:13:27,000
potentially create living organisms my

343
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
personal opinion is that if we found new

344
0:13:28.23,000 --> 0:13:32,000
life we might not even recognize it

345
0:13:30.32,000 --> 0:13:34,000
so this obsession with the search for

346
0:13:32.459,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Goldilocks planets and in exactly the

347
0:13:34.89,000 --> 0:13:37,000
right place with water and whatever that

348
0:13:36.449,000 --> 0:13:39,000
that's a very parochial assumption

349
0:13:38.399,000 --> 0:13:41,000
perhaps well if you want to find someone

350
0:13:39.93,000 --> 0:13:42,000
you can talk to then maybe not but you

351
0:13:42.149,000 --> 0:13:45,000
know I think that that if you're just

352
0:13:43.589,000 --> 0:13:45,000
looking for any form of life I think I

353
0:13:45.39,000 --> 0:13:47,000
think that's right I think that you're

354
0:13:46.529,000 --> 0:13:5,000
looking for life under the light post

355
0:13:48.32,000 --> 0:13:52,000
thank you for boggling all our minds

356
0:13:51.12,000 --> 0:13:56,000
thank you so much

357
0:13:52.35,000 --> 0:13:55,000
[Applause]

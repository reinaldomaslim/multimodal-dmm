1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
This may sound strange,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
with a very simple idea:

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
modules made of cement of a fixed measurement

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that fit together.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Very quickly concrete blocks became

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
the most-used construction unit in the world.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us,

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
buildings, bridges,

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
one brick at a time.

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Essentially concrete blocks had become

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the building block of our time.

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Almost a hundred years later in 1947,

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
LEGO came up with this.

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It was called the Automatic Binding Brick.

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And in a few short years,

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
LEGO bricks took place in every household.

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced --

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
or 75 bricks for every person on the planet.

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
You don't have to be an engineer

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings.

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
LEGO made it accessible.

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world,

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and made it into the building block

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
of our imagination.

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Meanwhile the exact same year,

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced,

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
the next building block.

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The transistor was a small plastic unit

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that would take us from a world

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
of static bricks piled on top of each other

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to a world where everything was interactive.

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Like the concrete block,

35
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
the transistor allows you to build

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time.

37
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But there's a main difference:

38
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The transistor was only for experts.

39
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I personally don't accept this,

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that the building block of our time

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
is reserved for experts,

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
so I decided to change that.

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab,

44
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I started exploring this idea

45
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
of how to put the power of engineers

46
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
in the hands of artists and designers.

47
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
A few years ago I started developing littleBits.

48
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Let me show you how they work.

49
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
LittleBits are electronic modules

50
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
with each one specific function.

51
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
They're pre-engineered

52
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to be light, sound,

53
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
motors and sensors.

54
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And the best part about it

55
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
is they snap together with magnets.

56
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So you can't put them the wrong way.

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The bricks are color-coded.

58
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Green is output, blue is power,

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
pink is input and orange is wire.

60
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green

61
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and very quickly you can start making larger circuits.

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
You put a blue to a green,

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
you can make light.

64
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
You can put a knob in between

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and now you've made a little dimmer.

66
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Switch out the knob

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
for a pulse module,

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
which is here,

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and now you've made a little blinker.

70
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Add this buzzer

71
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
for some extra punch

72
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and you've created a noise machine.

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I'm going to stop that.

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So beyond simple play,

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
littleBits are actually pretty powerful.

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder,

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
littleBits allow you to program

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
using very simple intuitive gestures.

79
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So to make this blink faster or slower,

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
you would just turn this knob

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and basically make it pulse faster or slower.

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
The idea behind littleBits

83
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
is that it's a growing library.

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We want to make every single interaction in the world

85
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
into a ready-to-use brick.

86
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors --

87
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
everything should be accessible.

88
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them.

89
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And it's been an incredible experience.

90
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
The nicest thing is how they start to understand

91
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
the electronics around them from everyday

92
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that they don't learn at schools.

93
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
For example, how a nightlight works,

94
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
or why an elevator door stays open,

95
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
or how an iPod responds to touch.

96
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
We've also been taking littleBits to design schools.

97
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So for example, we've had designers

98
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
with no experience with electronics whatsoever

99
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
start to play with littleBits as a material.

100
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Here you see, with felt and paper water bottles,

101
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
we have Geordie making ...

102
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
(Clanging)

103
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Buzzing)

104
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD

105
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and gave them to some designers

106
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
with no experience in engineering whatsoever --

107
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them "Make something."

108
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Here's an example of a project they made,

109
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
a motion-activated confetti canon ball.

110
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

111
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But wait, this is actually my favorite project.

112
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It's a lobster made of playdough

113
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that's afraid of the dark.

114
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Laughter)

115
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material,

116
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
electronics became just another material.

117
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone.

118
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So littleBits is open-source.

119
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself.

120
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
We want to encourage a world

121
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
of creators, of inventors, of contributors,

122
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
because this world that we live in,

123
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
this interactive world, is ours.

124
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So go ahead and start inventing.

125
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Thank you.

126
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Applause)

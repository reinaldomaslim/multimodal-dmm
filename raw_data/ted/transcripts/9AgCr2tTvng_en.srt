1
0:00:12.841,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So I know TED is about a lot of things that are big,

2
0:00:16.596,000 --> 0:00:19,000
but I want to talk to you about something very small.

3
0:00:20.15,000 --> 0:00:22,000
So small, it's a single word.

4
0:00:23.093,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The word is "misfit."

5
0:00:25.347,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It's one of my favorite words, because it's so literal.

6
0:00:29.403,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I mean, it's a person who sort of missed fitting in.

7
0:00:33.752,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Or a person who fits in badly.

8
0:00:36.658,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Or this: "a person who is poorly adapted

9
0:00:39.605,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to new situations and environments."

10
0:00:43.298,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I'm a card-carrying misfit.

11
0:00:46.307,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And I'm here for the other misfits in the room,

12
0:00:49.164,000 --> 0:00:5,000
because I'm never the only one.

13
0:00:51.995,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I'm going to tell you a misfit story.

14
0:00:55.237,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Somewhere in my early 30s,

15
0:00:57.793,000 --> 0:01:,000
the dream of becoming a writer came right to my doorstep.

16
0:01:02.198,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Actually, it came to my mailbox

17
0:01:03.826,000 --> 0:01:06,000
in the form of a letter that said I'd won a giant literary prize

18
0:01:07.509,000 --> 0:01:08,000
for a short story I had written.

19
0:01:10.183,000 --> 0:01:13,000
The short story was about my life as a competitive swimmer

20
0:01:14.632,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and about my crappy home life,

21
0:01:17.258,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and a little bit about how grief and loss can make you insane.

22
0:01:23.829,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The prize was a trip to New York City to meet big-time editors and agents

23
0:01:28.526,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and other authors.

24
0:01:30.278,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So kind of it was the wannabe writer's dream, right?

25
0:01:34.573,000 --> 0:01:36,000
You know what I did the day the letter came to my house?

26
0:01:38.037,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Because I'm me,

27
0:01:39.859,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I put the letter on my kitchen table,

28
0:01:42.08,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I poured myself a giant glass of vodka

29
0:01:45.922,000 --> 0:01:47,000
with ice and lime,

30
0:01:48.722,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and I sat there in my underwear for an entire day,

31
0:01:52.95,000 --> 0:01:54,000
just staring at the letter.

32
0:01:56.608,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I was thinking about all the ways I'd already screwed my life up.

33
0:01:59.777,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Who the hell was I to go to New York City

34
0:02:02.975,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and pretend to be a writer?

35
0:02:05.681,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Who was I?

36
0:02:07.07,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I'll tell you.

37
0:02:08.745,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I was a misfit.

38
0:02:10.625,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Like legions of other children,

39
0:02:13.908,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I came from an abusive household

40
0:02:16.3,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that I narrowly escaped with my life.

41
0:02:19.727,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I already had two epically failed marriages underneath my belt.

42
0:02:24.242,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I'd flunked out of college not once but twice

43
0:02:27.232,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and maybe even a third time that I'm not going to tell you about.

44
0:02:30.448,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:32.582,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And I'd done an episode of rehab for drug use.

46
0:02:36.795,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And I'd had two lovely staycations in jail.

47
0:02:42.228,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So I'm on the right stage.

48
0:02:45.68,000 --> 0:02:47,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:48.744,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But the real reason, I think, I was a misfit,

50
0:02:52.261,000 --> 0:02:55,000
is that my daughter died the day she was born,

51
0:02:55.547,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and I hadn't figured out how to live with that story yet.

52
0:03:00.233,000 --> 0:03:05,000
After my daughter died I also spent a long time homeless,

53
0:03:05.384,000 --> 0:03:06,000
living under an overpass

54
0:03:07.352,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in a kind of profound state of zombie grief and loss

55
0:03:11.594,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that some of us encounter along the way.

56
0:03:14.132,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Maybe all of us, if you live long enough.

57
0:03:18.24,000 --> 0:03:21,000
You know, homeless people are some of our most heroic misfits,

58
0:03:22.261,000 --> 0:03:25,000
because they start out as us.

59
0:03:26.67,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So you see, I'd missed fitting in to just about every category out there:

60
0:03:32.112,000 --> 0:03:36,000
daughter, wife, mother, scholar.

61
0:03:37.474,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And the dream of being a writer

62
0:03:39.997,000 --> 0:03:44,000
was really kind of like a small, sad stone in my throat.

63
0:03:46.906,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It was pretty much in spite of myself that I got on that plane

64
0:03:50.399,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and flew to New York City,

65
0:03:52.81,000 --> 0:03:53,000
where the writers are.

66
0:03:55.168,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Fellow misfits, I can almost see your heads glowing.

67
0:03:58.867,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I can pick you out of a room.

68
0:04:00.803,000 --> 0:04:02,000
At first, you would've loved it.

69
0:04:03.265,000 --> 0:04:05,000
You got to choose the three famous writers you wanted to meet,

70
0:04:06.241,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and these guys went and found them for you.

71
0:04:08.623,000 --> 0:04:1,000
You got set up at the Gramercy Park Hotel,

72
0:04:11.437,000 --> 0:04:13,000
where you got to drink Scotch late in the night

73
0:04:14.095,000 --> 0:04:16,000
with cool, smart, swank people.

74
0:04:16.61,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And you got to pretend you were cool and smart and swank, too.

75
0:04:21.143,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And you got to meet a bunch of editors and authors and agents

76
0:04:24.355,000 --> 0:04:28,000
at very, very fancy lunches and dinners.

77
0:04:29.377,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Ask me how fancy.

78
0:04:31.735,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Audience: How fancy?

79
0:04:34.077,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Lidia Yuknavitch: I'm making a confession: I stole three linen napkins --

80
0:04:38.419,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Laughter)

81
0:04:40.014,000 --> 0:04:41,000
from three different restaurants.

82
0:04:42.43,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And I shoved a menu down my pants.

83
0:04:44.72,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:46.82,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I just wanted some keepsakes so that when I got home,

85
0:04:50.55,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I could believe it had really happened to me.

86
0:04:53.241,000 --> 0:04:54,000
You know?

87
0:04:55.467,000 --> 0:04:56,000
The three writers I wanted to meet

88
0:04:57.155,000 --> 0:04:59,000
were Carole Maso, Lynne Tillman and Peggy Phelan.

89
0:05:00.496,000 --> 0:05:03,000
These were not famous, best-selling authors,

90
0:05:03.574,000 --> 0:05:06,000
but to me, they were women-writer titans.

91
0:05:07.7,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Carole Maso wrote the book that later became my art bible.

92
0:05:12.056,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Lynne Tillman gave me permission to believe

93
0:05:14.581,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that there was a chance my stories could be part of the world.

94
0:05:18.839,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And Peggy Phelan reminded me

95
0:05:20.817,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that maybe my brains could be more important than my boobs.

96
0:05:27.5,000 --> 0:05:29,000
They weren't mainstream women writers,

97
0:05:30.208,000 --> 0:05:33,000
but they were cutting a path through the mainstream

98
0:05:34.009,000 --> 0:05:35,000
with their body stories,

99
0:05:36.294,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I like to think, kind of the way water cut the Grand Canyon.

100
0:05:41.371,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It nearly killed me with joy

101
0:05:43.106,000 --> 0:05:46,000
to hang out with these three over-50-year-old women writers.

102
0:05:46.971,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And the reason it nearly killed me with joy

103
0:05:49.921,000 --> 0:05:51,000
is that I'd never known a joy like that.

104
0:05:52.014,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I'd never been in a room like that.

105
0:05:54.35,000 --> 0:05:55,000
My mother never went to college.

106
0:05:56.747,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And my creative career to that point

107
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
was a sort of small, sad, stillborn thing.

108
0:06:05.394,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So kind of in those first nights in New York I wanted to die there.

109
0:06:08.697,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I was just like, "Kill me now. I'm good. This is beautiful."

110
0:06:13.187,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Some of you in the room will understand what happened next.

111
0:06:16.935,000 --> 0:06:2,000
First, they took me to the offices of Farrar, Straus and Giroux.

112
0:06:21.863,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Farrar, Straus and Giroux was like my mega-dream press.

113
0:06:25.062,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I mean, T.S. Eliot and Flannery O'Connor were published there.

114
0:06:29.418,000 --> 0:06:33,000
The main editor guy sat me down and talked to me for a long time,

115
0:06:33.817,000 --> 0:06:35,000
trying to convince me I had a book in me

116
0:06:36.159,000 --> 0:06:37,000
about my life as a swimmer.

117
0:06:38.498,000 --> 0:06:39,000
You know, like a memoir.

118
0:06:40.63,000 --> 0:06:42,000
The whole time he was talking to me,

119
0:06:42.89,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I sat there smiling and nodding like a numb idiot,

120
0:06:47.509,000 --> 0:06:48,000
with my arms crossed over my chest,

121
0:06:49.385,000 --> 0:06:53,000
while nothing, nothing, nothing came out of my throat.

122
0:06:55.875,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So in the end, he patted me on the shoulder

123
0:06:59.266,000 --> 0:07:,000
like a swim coach might.

124
0:07:01.58,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And he wished me luck

125
0:07:03.439,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and he gave me some free books

126
0:07:05.901,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and he showed me out the door.

127
0:07:09.588,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Next, they took me to the offices of W.W. Norton,

128
0:07:12.879,000 --> 0:07:14,000
where I was pretty sure I'd be escorted from the building

129
0:07:15.603,000 --> 0:07:16,000
just for wearing Doc Martens.

130
0:07:18.19,000 --> 0:07:19,000
But that didn't happen.

131
0:07:20.512,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Being at the Norton offices

132
0:07:22.965,000 --> 0:07:26,000
felt like reaching up into the night sky and touching the moon

133
0:07:27.461,000 --> 0:07:3,000
while the stars stitched your name across the cosmos.

134
0:07:31.599,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I mean, that's how big a deal it was to me.

135
0:07:33.768,000 --> 0:07:34,000
You get it?

136
0:07:35.567,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Their lead editor, Carol Houck Smith,

137
0:07:38.089,000 --> 0:07:42,000
leaned over right in my face with these beady, bright, fierce eyes

138
0:07:42.456,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and said, "Well, send me something then, immediately!"

139
0:07:46.328,000 --> 0:07:48,000
See, now most people, especially TED people,

140
0:07:48.644,000 --> 0:07:5,000
would have run to the mailbox, right?

141
0:07:51.651,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It took me over a decade to even imagine

142
0:07:54.953,000 --> 0:07:57,000
putting something in an envelope and licking a stamp.

143
0:08:00.741,000 --> 0:08:01,000
On the last night,

144
0:08:02.339,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I gave a big reading at the National Poetry Club.

145
0:08:06.342,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And at the end of the reading,

146
0:08:08.313,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Katharine Kidde of Kidde, Hoyt & Picard Literary Agency,

147
0:08:12.64,000 --> 0:08:14,000
walked straight up to me and shook my hand

148
0:08:15.251,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and offered me representation, like, on the spot.

149
0:08:20.558,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I stood there and I kind of went deaf.

150
0:08:23.569,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Has this ever happened to you?

151
0:08:25.703,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And I almost started crying

152
0:08:27.839,000 --> 0:08:3,000
because all the people in the room were dressed so beautifully,

153
0:08:31.788,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and all that came out of my mouth was:

154
0:08:34.965,000 --> 0:08:37,000
"I don't know. I have to think about it."

155
0:08:38.805,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And she said, "OK, then," and walked away.

156
0:08:44.884,000 --> 0:08:5,000
All those open hands out to me, that small, sad stone in my throat ...

157
0:08:51.427,000 --> 0:08:54,000
You see, I'm trying to tell you something about people like me.

158
0:08:55.389,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Misfit people -- we don't always know how to hope or say yes

159
0:08:59.466,000 --> 0:09:,000
or choose the big thing,

160
0:09:01.101,000 --> 0:09:03,000
even when it's right in front of us.

161
0:09:03.271,000 --> 0:09:04,000
It's a shame we carry.

162
0:09:04.914,000 --> 0:09:05,000
It's the shame of wanting something good.

163
0:09:06.929,000 --> 0:09:07,000
It's the shame of feeling something good.

164
0:09:08.945,000 --> 0:09:12,000
It's the shame of not really believing we deserve to be in the room

165
0:09:13.351,000 --> 0:09:15,000
with the people we admire.

166
0:09:16.472,000 --> 0:09:18,000
If I could, I'd go back and I'd coach myself.

167
0:09:19.422,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I'd be exactly like those over-50-year-old women who helped me.

168
0:09:23.789,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I'd teach myself how to want things,

169
0:09:25.714,000 --> 0:09:27,000
how to stand up, how to ask for them.

170
0:09:28.078,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I'd say, "You! Yeah, you! You belong in the room, too."

171
0:09:32.408,000 --> 0:09:34,000
The radiance falls on all of us,

172
0:09:34.704,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and we are nothing without each other.

173
0:09:39.041,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Instead, I flew back to Oregon,

174
0:09:42.337,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and as I watched the evergreens and rain come back into view,

175
0:09:48.053,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I just drank many tiny bottles of airplane "feel sorry for yourself."

176
0:09:53.491,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I thought about how, if I was a writer, I was some kind of misfit writer.

177
0:09:59.244,000 --> 0:10:,000
What I'm saying is,

178
0:10:00.427,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I flew back to Oregon without a book deal,

179
0:10:02.455,000 --> 0:10:03,000
without an agent,

180
0:10:03.63,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and with only a headful and heart-ful of memories

181
0:10:06.139,000 --> 0:10:09,000
of having sat so near

182
0:10:09.311,000 --> 0:10:11,000
the beautiful writers.

183
0:10:12.278,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Memory was the only prize I allowed myself.

184
0:10:17.175,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And yet, at home in the dark,

185
0:10:21.272,000 --> 0:10:22,000
back in my underwear,

186
0:10:23.788,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I could still hear their voices.

187
0:10:26.264,000 --> 0:10:3,000
They said, "Don't listen to anyone who tries to get you to shut up

188
0:10:30.329,000 --> 0:10:31,000
or change your story."

189
0:10:32.861,000 --> 0:10:35,000
They said, "Give voice to the story only you know how to tell."

190
0:10:36.564,000 --> 0:10:38,000
They said, "Sometimes telling the story

191
0:10:39.018,000 --> 0:10:42,000
is the thing that saves your life."

192
0:10:43.703,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Now I am, as you can see, the woman over 50.

193
0:10:48.278,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And I'm a writer.

194
0:10:50.516,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And I'm a mother.

195
0:10:52.441,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And I became a teacher.

196
0:10:54.97,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Guess who my favorite students are.

197
0:10:58.604,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Although it didn't happen the day

198
0:11:00.256,000 --> 0:11:02,000
that dream letter came through my mailbox,

199
0:11:02.534,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I did write a memoir,

200
0:11:04.231,000 --> 0:11:05,000
called "The Chronology of Water."

201
0:11:06.889,000 --> 0:11:1,000
In it are the stories of how many times I've had to reinvent a self

202
0:11:11.612,000 --> 0:11:13,000
from the ruins of my choices,

203
0:11:14.575,000 --> 0:11:19,000
the stories of how my seeming failures were really just weird-ass portals

204
0:11:20.009,000 --> 0:11:21,000
to something beautiful.

205
0:11:22.309,000 --> 0:11:25,000
All I had to do was give voice to the story.

206
0:11:27.552,000 --> 0:11:31,000
There's a myth in most cultures about following your dreams.

207
0:11:32.664,000 --> 0:11:33,000
It's called the hero's journey.

208
0:11:35.679,000 --> 0:11:36,000
But I prefer a different myth,

209
0:11:37.527,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that's slightly to the side of that

210
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
or underneath it.

211
0:11:41.089,000 --> 0:11:42,000
It's called the misfit's myth.

212
0:11:43.763,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And it goes like this:

213
0:11:45.623,000 --> 0:11:47,000
even at the moment of your failure,

214
0:11:47.902,000 --> 0:11:49,000
right then, you are beautiful.

215
0:11:51.585,000 --> 0:11:52,000
You don't know it yet,

216
0:11:52.761,000 --> 0:11:55,000
but you have the ability to reinvent yourself

217
0:11:55.962,000 --> 0:11:56,000
endlessly.

218
0:11:57.184,000 --> 0:11:58,000
That's your beauty.

219
0:11:59.694,000 --> 0:12:,000
You can be a drunk,

220
0:12:01.234,000 --> 0:12:03,000
you can be a survivor of abuse,

221
0:12:03.607,000 --> 0:12:04,000
you can be an ex-con,

222
0:12:05.067,000 --> 0:12:06,000
you can be a homeless person,

223
0:12:06.589,000 --> 0:12:09,000
you can lose all your money or your job or your husband

224
0:12:09.891,000 --> 0:12:11,000
or your wife, or the worst thing of all,

225
0:12:12.329,000 --> 0:12:13,000
a child.

226
0:12:13.864,000 --> 0:12:15,000
You can even lose your marbles.

227
0:12:15.941,000 --> 0:12:19,000
You can be standing dead center in the middle of your failure

228
0:12:20.034,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and still, I'm only here to tell you,

229
0:12:22.936,000 --> 0:12:24,000
you are so beautiful.

230
0:12:25.073,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Your story deserves to be heard,

231
0:12:27.396,000 --> 0:12:31,000
because you, you rare and phenomenal misfit,

232
0:12:31.693,000 --> 0:12:33,000
you new species,

233
0:12:34.568,000 --> 0:12:35,000
are the only one in the room

234
0:12:36.561,000 --> 0:12:37,000
who can tell the story

235
0:12:38.201,000 --> 0:12:4,000
the way only you would.

236
0:12:41.71,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And I'd be listening.

237
0:12:44.863,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Thank you.

238
0:12:46.063,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Applause)

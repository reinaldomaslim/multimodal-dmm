1
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I am known best for human-powered flight,

2
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but that was just one thing that got me going

3
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:41,000
in the sort of things that I'm working in now.

4
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:47,000
As a youngster, I was very interested in model airplanes,

5
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:53,000
ornithopters, autogyros, helicopters, gliders, power planes,

6
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:56,000
indoor models, outdoor models, everything,

7
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:59,000
which I just thought was a lot of fun,

8
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and wondered why most other people didn't share my same enthusiasm with them.

9
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And then, navy pilot training, and, after college,

10
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I got into sailplane flying, power plane flying,

11
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and considered the sailplanes as a sort of hobby and fun,

12
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but got tangled up with some great professor types,

13
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:34,000
who convinced me and everybody else in the field

14
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that this was a good way to get into really deep science.

15
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:45,000
While this was all going on, I was in the field of weather modification,

16
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:49,000
although getting a Ph.D. in aeronautics.

17
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:53,000
The weather modification subject was getting started,

18
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and as a graduate student,

19
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I could go around to the various talks that were being given,

20
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
on a hitchhiker ride to the East Coast,

21
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and so on. And everybody would talk to me,

22
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:07,000
but all the professionals in the field hated each other,

23
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and they wouldn't communicate. And as a result,

24
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I got the absolutely unique background in that field,

25
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and started a company, which did more research

26
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:23,000
in weather modification than anybody,

27
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and there are a lot of things that I just can't go into.

28
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But then, 1971 started AeroVironment, with no employees --

29
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:37,000
then one or two, three,

30
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and sort of fumbled along on trying to get interesting projects.

31
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:43,000
We had AirDynamisis,

32
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:48,000
who, like I, did not want to work for aerospace companies

33
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:52,000
on some big, many year project,

34
0:02:52,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and so we did our small projects, and the company slowly grew.

35
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The thing that is exciting was, in 1976,

36
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I suddenly got interested in the human-powered airplane

37
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:15,000
because I'd made a made a loan to a friend of 100,000 dollars,

38
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:17,000
or I guaranteed the money at the bank.

39
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:21,000
He needed them -- he needed the money for starting a company.

40
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:24,000
The company did not succeed, and he couldn't pay the money back,

41
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and I was the guarantor of the note. So, I had a $100,000 debt,

42
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and I noticed that the Kramer prize for human-powered flight,

43
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:38,000
which had then been around for -- (Laughter) --

44
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:42,000
17 years at the time, was 50,000 pounds,

45
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:46,000
which, at the exchange rate, was just about 100,000 dollars.

46
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So suddenly, I was interested in human-powered flight --

47
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Laughter) --

48
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and did not -- the way I approached it, first,

49
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:01,000
thinking about ways to make the planes,

50
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:06,000
was just like they'd been doing in England, and not succeeding,

51
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and I gave it up. I figured, nah, there isn't any simple, easy way.

52
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But then, got off on a vacation trip, and was studying bird flight,

53
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
just for the fun of it,

54
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and you can watch a bird soaring around in circles,

55
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and measure the time, and estimate the bank angle,

56
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and immediately, figure out its speed,

57
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and the turning radius, and so on,

58
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:36,000
which I could do in the car, as we're driving along on a vacation trip --

59
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Laughter) --

60
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:42,000
with my three sons, young sons, helping me,

61
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:46,000
but ridiculing the whole thing very much.

62
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But that began thinking about how birds went around,

63
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and then how airplanes would, how hang gliders would fly,

64
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:,000
and then other planes,

65
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and the idea of the Gossamer-Condor-type airplane quickly emerged,

66
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:09,000
was so logical, one should have thought of it in the first place,

67
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:13,000
but one didn't. And it was just, keep the weight down --

68
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:2,000
70 pounds was all it weighed -- but let the size swell up, like a hang glider,

69
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:22,000
but three times the span, three times the cord.

70
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:25,000
You're down to a third of the speed, a third of the power,

71
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and a good bicyclist can put out that power, and that worked,

72
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and we won the prize a year later.

73
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:43,000
We didn't -- a lot of flying, a lot of experiments, a lot of things that didn't work,

74
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and ones that did work, and the plane kept getting a little better, a little better.

75
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Got a good pilot, Brian Allen, to operate it,

76
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and finally, succeeded. But unfortunately,

77
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:59,000
about 65,000 dollars was spent on the project.

78
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Laughter)

79
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And there was only about 30 to help retire the debt.

80
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But fortunately, Henry Kramer, who put up the prize for --

81
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that was a one-mile flight -- put up a new prize

82
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:14,000
for flying the English Channel, 21 miles.

83
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And he thought it would take another 18 years for somebody to win that.

84
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:24,000
We realized that if you just cleaned up our Gossamer Condor a little bit,

85
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the power to fly would be decreased a little bit,

86
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and if you decrease the power required a little,

87
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:34,000
the pilot can fly a much longer period of time.

88
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And Brian Allen was able, in a miraculous flight,

89
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:42,000
to get the Gossamer Albatross across the English Channel,

90
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and we won the 100,000-pound, 200,000-dollar prize for that.

91
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And when all expenses were paid, the debt was handled, and everything was fine.

92
0:06:57,000 --> 0:07:,000
It turned out that giving the planes to the museum

93
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:04,000
was worth much more than the debt,

94
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:11,000
so for five years, six years, I only had to pay one third income tax.

95
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So, there were good economic reasons for the project, but --

96
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter) --

97
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that's not, well, the project was done entirely for economic reasons,

98
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and we have not been involved in any human-powered flight since then --

99
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Laughter) --

100
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:35,000
because the prizes are all over.

101
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Laughter)

102
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But that sure started me thinking about various things,

103
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and immediately, we began making a solar-powered plane

104
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:49,000
because we felt solar power was going to be so important

105
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:51,000
for the country and the world,

106
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:56,000
we didn't want the small funding in the government to be decreased,

107
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:58,000
which is what the government was trying to do with it.

108
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn't really make sense,

109
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:07,000
but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power

110
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and maybe help that field.

111
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And that project continued, did succeed,

112
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and we then got into other projects in aviation

113
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and mechanical things and ground devices.

114
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:3,000
But while this was going on,

115
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:35,000
in 1982, I got a prize from the Lindbergh Foundation --

116
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:37,000
their annual prize --

117
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and I had to prepare a paper on it,

118
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:44,000
which collected all my varied thoughts

119
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and varied interests over the years.

120
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:51,000
This was the one chance that I had to focus on what I, really, was after,

121
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and what was important. And to my surprise,

122
0:08:55,000 --> 0:09:,000
I realized the importance of environmental issues,

123
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:05,000
which Charles Lindbergh devoted the last third of his life to,

124
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and preparing that paper did me a lot of good.

125
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I thought back about if I was a space traveler,

126
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and came and visited Earth every 5,000 years.

127
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And for a few thousand visits, I would see the same thing every time,

128
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:26,000
the little differences in the Earth.

129
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
But this last time, just coming round, right now,

130
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:35,000
suddenly, there'd be huge changes in the environment,

131
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:38,000
in the concentration of people,

132
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and it was just unbelievable, the amount of -- all the change in it.

133
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I wanted to -- well, one of the biggest changes is, 200 years ago,

134
0:09:55,000 --> 0:10:01,000
we began using coal from underground, which has a lot of pollution,

135
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and 100 years ago, began getting gasoline from underground,

136
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:11,000
with a lot of pollution. And gasoline consumption, or production,

137
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:16,000
will reach its limit in about ten years, and then go down,

138
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and we wonder what's going to happen with transportation.

139
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I wanted to show the slide --

140
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:34,000
this slide, I think, is the most important one any of you will see, ever, because --

141
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:36,000
(Laughter)

142
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:39,000
(Applause) --

143
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:46,000
it shows nature versus humans, and goes from 1850 to 2050.

144
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And so, the year 2000, you see there.

145
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And this is the weight of all air and land vertebrates.

146
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Humans and muskrats and giraffes and birds and so on, are --

147
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:06,000
the red line goes up. That's the humans and livestock and pets portion.

148
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:09,000
The green line goes down. That's the wild nature portion.

149
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Humans, livestock and pets are, now, 98 percent of the total world's mass

150
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
of vertebrates on land and air.

151
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And you don't know what the future will hold,

152
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:26,000
but it's not going to get a lower percentage.

153
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Ten thousand years ago, the humans and livestock and pets

154
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:32,000
were not even one tenth of one percent

155
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and wouldn't even have been visible on such a curve.

156
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Now they are 98 percent, and it, I think, shows human domination of the Earth.

157
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:54,000
I give a talk to some remarkable high school students each summer,

158
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and ask them, after they've asked me questions,

159
0:11:57,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and I give them a talk and so on. Then I ask them questions.

160
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:03,000
What's the population of the Earth?

161
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:05,000
What's the population of the Earth going to be

162
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:07,000
when you're the age of your parents?

163
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Which I'd never, really -- they had never, really, thought about

164
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:11,000
but, now, they think about it.

165
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And then, what population of the Earth would be an equilibrium

166
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:24,000
that could continue on, and be for 2050, 2100, 2150?

167
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And they form little groups, all fighting with each other,

168
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and when I leave, two hours later,

169
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:33,000
most of them are saying about 2 billion people,

170
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and they don't have any clue about how to get down to 2 billion,

171
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:46,000
nor do I, but I think they're right and this is a serious problem.

172
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Rachel Carson was thinking of these, and came out with "Silent Spring," way back.

173
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:57,000
"Solar Manifesto" by Hermann Scheer, in Germany,

174
0:12:57,000 --> 0:13:02,000
claims all energy on Earth can be derived, for every country,

175
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:1,000
from solar energy and water, and so on.

176
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:13,000
You don't need to dig down for these chemicals,

177
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and we can do things much more efficiently.

178
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Let's have the next slide.

179
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:22,000
So this just summarizes it. "Over billions of years,

180
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:25,000
on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life --

181
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:28,000
complex and probable, wonderful and fragile.

182
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Suddenly, we humans, a recently arrived species,

183
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:35,000
no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature,

184
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:38,000
have grown in population, technology and intelligence

185
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:42,000
to a position of terrible power. We, now, wield the paintbrush."

186
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:46,000
We're in charge. It's frightening.

187
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And I do a painting every 20 or 25 years. This is the last one.

188
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:53,000
(Laughter)

189
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And [it] shows the Earth in a time flag: on the right,

190
0:13:57,000 --> 0:14:,000
in trilobites and dinosaurs and so on;

191
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and over the triangle, we now get to civilization and TV

192
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and traffic jams and so on.

193
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:1,000
I have no idea of what comes next,

194
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:15,000
so I just used robotic and natural cockroaches as the future,

195
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:17,000
as a little warning.

196
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And two weeks after this drawing was done,

197
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:24,000
we actually had our first project contract, at AeroVironment,

198
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:29,000
on robotic cockroaches, which was very frightening to me.

199
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:31,000
(Laughter)

200
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:34,000
(Paper rustling)

201
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Well, that'll be all the slides.

202
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:44,000
As time went on, we stopped our environmental programs.

203
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:49,000
We focused more on the really serious energy problems

204
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:56,000
of the future, and we produced products for the company.

205
0:14:56,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And we developed the impact car that General Motors made,

206
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:04,000
the EV1, out of --

207
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and got the Air Resources Board to have the regulations

208
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:15,000
that stimulated the electric cars, but they've since come apart.

209
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And we've done a lot of things, small drone airplanes and so on.

210
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:27,000
I have a Helios. We have the first video.

211
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:34,000
(Video) Narrator: With a wingspan of 247 feet, this makes her larger than a Boeing 747.

212
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:43,000
(Music)

213
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Her designers' attention to detail and her construction

214
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:49,000
gives Helios' structure the flexibility and strength

215
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:52,000
to deal with the turbulence encountered in the atmosphere.

216
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:55,000
This enables her to easily ride through the air currents

217
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:58,000
as if she's sliding along on the ocean waves.

218
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Paul MacCready: The wings could touch together on top and not break. We think.

219
0:16:03,000 --> 0:16:06,000
(Laughter)

220
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Narrator: And Helios now begins the process of turning her back to the sun,

221
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:12,000
to maximize the power from her solar array.

222
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:2,000
(Music)

223
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:24,000
As the sky gets darker, and the outside air temperatures drop

224
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:26,000
below minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit,

225
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:3,000
the most environmentally hostile segment of Helios's journey

226
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:32,000
has gone by without notice,

227
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:36,000
except for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems

228
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and their associated sensors.

229
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Approaching a peak radar altitude of 96,863 feet,

230
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:49,000
at 4:12 p.m., Helios is standing on top of 98 percent of the Earth's atmosphere.

231
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:52,000
This is more than 10,000 feet higher

232
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:57,000
than the previous world's altitude record held by the SR-71 Blackbird.

233
0:16:57,000 --> 0:17:05,000
(Applause)

234
0:17:06,000 --> 0:17:11,000
PM: That plane has many purposes, but it's aimed for communications,

235
0:17:11,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and it can fly so slowly that it'll just stay up at 65,000 feet.

236
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Eventually, it will be able to have to stay up day, night, day, night,

237
0:17:21,000 --> 0:17:25,000
for six months at a time, acting like the synchronous satellite,

238
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:27,000
but only ten miles above the Earth.

239
0:17:27,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Let's have the next video. This shows the other end of the spectrum.

240
0:17:3,000 --> 0:17:33,000
(Video) Narrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance.

241
0:17:33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
In effect a pair of roving eyeglasses,

242
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:38,000
a cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead

243
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:4,000
if the operator is remote from the vehicle.

244
0:17:41,000 --> 0:17:44,000
It is convenient to carry, assemble, and launch by hand.

245
0:17:44,000 --> 0:17:47,000
Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.

246
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:51,000
It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.

247
0:17:51,000 --> 0:17:55,000
With on-board GPS, it can navigate autonomously,

248
0:17:55,000 --> 0:17:58,000
and it is rugged enough to self-land without damage.

249
0:17:59,000 --> 0:18:01,000
PM: Okay, and let's have the next.

250
0:18:01,000 --> 0:18:05,000
(Applause)

251
0:18:05,000 --> 0:18:1,000
That plane is widely used by the military, now, in all their operations.

252
0:18:1,000 --> 0:18:12,000
Let's have the next video.

253
0:18:14,000 --> 0:18:28,000
(Video) (Music)

254
0:18:28,000 --> 0:18:3,000
Alan Alda: He's got it, he's got it, he's got it on his head.

255
0:18:3,000 --> 0:18:32,000
(Music)

256
0:18:32,000 --> 0:18:35,000
We're going to end our visit with Paul MacCready's flying circus

257
0:18:35,000 --> 0:18:38,000
by meeting his son, Tyler, who, with his two brothers,

258
0:18:38,000 --> 0:18:41,000
helped build the Gossamer Condor, 25 years ago.

259
0:18:42,000 --> 0:18:44,000
Tyler MacCready: You can chase it, like this, for hours.

260
0:18:44,000 --> 0:18:47,000
AA: When they got bored with their father's project,

261
0:18:47,000 --> 0:18:49,000
they invented an extraordinary little plane of their own.

262
0:18:49,000 --> 0:18:54,000
TM: And I can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing, or on the other.

263
0:18:54,000 --> 0:18:56,000
AA: They called it their Walkalong Glider.

264
0:18:56,000 --> 0:18:57,000
(Music)

265
0:18:58,000 --> 0:18:59,000
I've never seen anything like that.

266
0:18:59,000 --> 0:19:01,000
How old were you when you invented that?

267
0:19:01,000 --> 0:19:04,000
TM: Oh, 10, 11. (AA: Oh my God.)

268
0:19:04,000 --> 0:19:06,000
TM: 12, something like that. (AA: That's amazing.)

269
0:19:06,000 --> 0:19:09,000
PM: And Tyler's here to show you the Walkalong.

270
0:19:09,000 --> 0:19:14,000
(Applause)

271
0:19:14,000 --> 0:19:18,000
TM: All right. You all got a couple of these in your gift bags,

272
0:19:18,000 --> 0:19:2,000
and one of the first things,

273
0:19:21,000 --> 0:19:23,000
the production version seemed to dive a little bit,

274
0:19:23,000 --> 0:19:26,000
and so I would just suggest you bend the wing tips up a little bit

275
0:19:26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
before you try flying it.

276
0:19:28,000 --> 0:19:3,000
I'll give you a demonstration of how it works.

277
0:19:3,000 --> 0:19:36,000
The idea is that it soars on the lift over your body, like a seagull soaring on a cliff.

278
0:19:36,000 --> 0:19:39,000
As the wind comes up, it has to go over the cliff, so

279
0:19:39,000 --> 0:19:44,000
as you walk through the air, it goes around your body, some has to go over you.

280
0:19:44,000 --> 0:19:47,000
And so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current.

281
0:19:47,000 --> 0:19:5,000
The launch is the difficult part: you've got to hold it high up, over your head,

282
0:19:5,000 --> 0:19:56,000
and you start walking forward, and just let go of it, and you can control it like that.

283
0:19:56,000 --> 0:19:58,000
(Laughter)

284
0:19:58,000 --> 0:20:01,000
And then also, like it said in the video,

285
0:20:01,000 --> 0:20:03,000
you can turn it left or right

286
0:20:03,000 --> 0:20:05,000
just by putting the lift under one wing or another.

287
0:20:05,000 --> 0:20:1,000
So I can do it -- oops, that was going to be a right turn.

288
0:20:1,000 --> 0:20:11,000
(Laughter)

289
0:20:11,000 --> 0:20:13,000
Okay, this one will be a left turn.

290
0:20:15,000 --> 0:20:17,000
Here, but --

291
0:20:17,000 --> 0:20:18,000
(Applause) --

292
0:20:18,000 --> 0:20:2,000
anyway.

293
0:20:2,000 --> 0:20:23,000
(Applause)

294
0:20:23,000 --> 0:20:26,000
And that's it, so you can just control it, wherever you want,

295
0:20:26,000 --> 0:20:3,000
and it's just hours of fun. And these are no longer in production,

296
0:20:3,000 --> 0:20:32,000
so you have real collector's items.

297
0:20:32,000 --> 0:20:34,000
(Laughter)

298
0:20:34,000 --> 0:20:38,000
And this, we just wanted to show you --

299
0:20:39,000 --> 0:20:41,000
if we can get the video running on this, yeah --

300
0:20:41,000 --> 0:20:47,000
just an example of a little video surveillance.

301
0:20:47,000 --> 0:20:49,000
(Laughter)

302
0:20:49,000 --> 0:20:53,000
This was flying around in the party last night, and --

303
0:20:53,000 --> 0:20:55,000
(Laughter) --

304
0:20:55,000 --> 0:20:58,000
you can see how it just can fly around,

305
0:20:58,000 --> 0:21:,000
and you can spy on anybody you want.

306
0:21:,000 --> 0:21:06,000
(Laughter)

307
0:21:06,000 --> 0:21:08,000
And that's it. I was going to bring an airplane,

308
0:21:08,000 --> 0:21:1,000
but I was worried about hitting people in here,

309
0:21:1,000 --> 0:21:13,000
so I thought this would be a little bit more gentle.

310
0:21:14,000 --> 0:21:17,000
And that's it, yeah, just a few inventions.

311
0:21:17,000 --> 0:21:25,000
(Applause)

312
0:21:25,000 --> 0:21:27,000
All right.

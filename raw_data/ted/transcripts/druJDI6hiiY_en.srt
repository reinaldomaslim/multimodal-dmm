1
0:00:12.44,000 --> 0:00:16,000
The word concussion evokes a fear these days more so than it ever has,

2
0:00:17.12,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and I know this personally.

3
0:00:19.52,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I played 10 years of football,

4
0:00:22.2,000 --> 0:00:24,000
was struck in the head thousands of times.

5
0:00:24.64,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And I have to tell you, though, what was much worse than that

6
0:00:28.32,000 --> 0:00:32,000
was a pair of bike accidents I had where I suffered concussions,

7
0:00:33.12,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and I'm still dealing with the effects of the most recent one

8
0:00:36.08,000 --> 0:00:37,000
today as I stand in front of you.

9
0:00:39.64,000 --> 0:00:41,000
There is a fear around concussion

10
0:00:42.12,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that does have some evidence behind it.

11
0:00:45.6,000 --> 0:00:48,000
There is information that a repeated history of concussion

12
0:00:48.96,000 --> 0:00:51,000
can lead to early dementia, such as Alzheimer's,

13
0:00:52.28,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

14
0:00:54.36,000 --> 0:00:57,000
That was the subject of the Will Smith movie "Concussion."

15
0:00:58.56,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And so everybody is caught up in football and what they see in the military,

16
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but you may not know

17
0:01:03.52,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that bike riding is the leading cause of concussion for kids,

18
0:01:07.84,000 --> 0:01:08,000
sports-related concussion, that is.

19
0:01:11.04,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And so another thing that I should tell you

20
0:01:13.64,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that you may not know

21
0:01:14.88,000 --> 0:01:16,000
is that the helmets that are worn in bicycling and football

22
0:01:17.84,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and many activities,

23
0:01:19.52,000 --> 0:01:21,000
they're not designed or tested

24
0:01:22.12,000 --> 0:01:25,000
for how well they can protect your children against concussion.

25
0:01:26.2,000 --> 0:01:27,000
They're in fact designed and tested

26
0:01:27.96,000 --> 0:01:29,000
for their ability to protect against skull fracture.

27
0:01:31.84,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And so I get this question all the time from parents,

28
0:01:37.48,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and they ask me,

29
0:01:39.08,000 --> 0:01:41,000
"Would you let your own child play football?"

30
0:01:41.4,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Or, "Should I let my child play soccer?"

31
0:01:44.6,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And I think that as a field,

32
0:01:47.52,000 --> 0:01:51,000
we're a long way from giving an answer with any kind of confidence there.

33
0:01:53.44,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So I look at that question from a bit of a different lens,

34
0:01:57.04,000 --> 0:02:,000
and I want to know, how can we prevent concussion?

35
0:02:00.8,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Is that even possible?

36
0:02:02.48,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And most experts think that it's not,

37
0:02:06.52,000 --> 0:02:08,000
but the work that we're doing in my lab

38
0:02:08.76,000 --> 0:02:12,000
is starting to reveal more of the details around concussion

39
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
so that we can have a better understanding.

40
0:02:15.96,000 --> 0:02:17,000
The reason we're able to prevent skull fracture with helmets

41
0:02:18.84,000 --> 0:02:2,000
is because it's pretty simple. We know how it works.

42
0:02:21.32,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Concussion has been much more of a mystery.

43
0:02:24.28,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So to give you a sense of what might be happening in a concussion,

44
0:02:29.24,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I want to show you the video here

45
0:02:31.2,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that you see when you type into Google,

46
0:02:33.76,000 --> 0:02:34,000
"What is a concussion?"

47
0:02:35.2,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The CDC website comes up,

48
0:02:36.88,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and this video essentially tells the whole story.

49
0:02:40.36,000 --> 0:02:42,000
What you see is the head moves forward,

50
0:02:42.8,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the brain lags behind,

51
0:02:44.88,000 --> 0:02:45,000
then the brain catches up

52
0:02:46.32,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and smashes into the skull.

53
0:02:48.6,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It rebounds off the skull

54
0:02:50.8,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and then proceeds to run into the other side of the skull.

55
0:02:55.32,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And what you'll notice is highlighted in this video from the CDC,

56
0:02:58.96,000 --> 0:03:,000
which I'll note was funded by the NFL,

57
0:03:01.44,000 --> 0:03:03,000
is that the outer surface of the brain,

58
0:03:04.4,000 --> 0:03:07,000
where it was to have smashed into the skull,

59
0:03:07.72,000 --> 0:03:1,000
looks like it's been damaged or injured, so it's on the outer surface of the brain.

60
0:03:11.68,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And what I'd like to do with this video

61
0:03:13.68,000 --> 0:03:16,000
is to tell you that there are some aspects that are probably right,

62
0:03:17.4,000 --> 0:03:2,000
indicative of what the scientists think happens with concussion,

63
0:03:20.44,000 --> 0:03:22,000
but there's probably more that's wrong with this video.

64
0:03:23.08,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So one thing that I do agree with, and I think most experts would,

65
0:03:26.36,000 --> 0:03:28,000
is that the brain does have these dynamics.

66
0:03:28.4,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It does lag behind the skull

67
0:03:30.8,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and then catch up and move back and forth and oscillate.

68
0:03:33.48,000 --> 0:03:34,000
That we think is true.

69
0:03:35.76,000 --> 0:03:38,000
However, the amount of motion you see in the brain in this video

70
0:03:39.08,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is probably not right at all.

71
0:03:40.68,000 --> 0:03:43,000
There's very little room in the cranial vault,

72
0:03:44.12,000 --> 0:03:45,000
only a few millimeters,

73
0:03:45.84,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and it's filled entirely with cerebral spinal fluid,

74
0:03:49.04,000 --> 0:03:51,000
which acts as a protective layer.

75
0:03:51.24,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And so the brain as a whole probably moves very little inside the skull.

76
0:03:56.52,000 --> 0:03:58,000
The other problem with this video

77
0:03:58.6,000 --> 0:03:59,000
is that the brain is shown

78
0:04:00.36,000 --> 0:04:03,000
as a kind of rigid whole as it moves around,

79
0:04:03.48,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and that's not true either.

80
0:04:05.72,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Your brain is one of the softest substances in your body,

81
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and you can think of it kind of like jello.

82
0:04:11.2,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So as your head is moving back and forth,

83
0:04:13.36,000 --> 0:04:15,000
your brain is twisting and turning and contorting,

84
0:04:16.24,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and the tissue is getting stretched.

85
0:04:18.48,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And so most experts, I think, would agree

86
0:04:21.52,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that concussion is not likely to be something that's happening

87
0:04:24.68,000 --> 0:04:25,000
on this outer surface of the brain,

88
0:04:26.52,000 --> 0:04:28,000
but rather it's something that's much deeper

89
0:04:28.64,000 --> 0:04:29,000
towards the center of the brain.

90
0:04:31.279,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Now, the way that we're approaching this problem

91
0:04:33.88,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to try to understand the mechanisms of concussion

92
0:04:36.24,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and to figure out if we can prevent it

93
0:04:38.12,000 --> 0:04:4,000
is we are using a device like this.

94
0:04:40.96,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It's a mouthguard.

95
0:04:42.96,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It has sensors in it that are essentially the same

96
0:04:45.88,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that are in your cell phone:

97
0:04:47.24,000 --> 0:04:49,000
accelerometers, gyroscopes,

98
0:04:49.6,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and when someone is struck in the head,

99
0:04:51.52,000 --> 0:04:53,000
it can tell you how their head moved

100
0:04:54.08,000 --> 0:04:57,000
at a thousand samples per second.

101
0:04:58.76,000 --> 0:05:,000
The principle behind the mouthguard is this:

102
0:05:01.48,000 --> 0:05:02,000
it fits onto your teeth.

103
0:05:02.76,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Your teeth are one of the hardest substances in your body.

104
0:05:05.84,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So it rigidly couples to your skull

105
0:05:07.92,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and gives you the most precise possible measurement

106
0:05:10.36,000 --> 0:05:11,000
of how the skull moves.

107
0:05:12.32,000 --> 0:05:14,000
People have tried other approaches, with helmets.

108
0:05:14.88,000 --> 0:05:17,000
We've looked at other sensors that go on your skin,

109
0:05:18.28,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and they all simply move around too much,

110
0:05:20.92,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and so we found that this is the only reliable way

111
0:05:23.64,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to take a good measurement.

112
0:05:27.4,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So now that we've got this device, we can go beyond studying cadavers,

113
0:05:31.72,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because you can only learn so much about concussion

114
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
from studying a cadaver,

115
0:05:35.4,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and we want to learn and study live humans.

116
0:05:38.2,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So where can we find a group of willing volunteers

117
0:05:42.12,000 --> 0:05:46,000
to go out and smash their heads into each other on a regular basis

118
0:05:46.4,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and sustain concussion?

119
0:05:47.64,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Well, I was one of them,

120
0:05:49.56,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and it's your local friendly Stanford football team.

121
0:05:53.64,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So this is our laboratory,

122
0:05:55.28,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and I want to show you

123
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:,000
the first concussion we measured with this device.

124
0:06:00.2,000 --> 0:06:04,000
One of the things that I should point out is the device has this gyroscope in it,

125
0:06:04.48,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and that allows you to measure the rotation of the head.

126
0:06:07.24,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Most experts think that that's the critical factor

127
0:06:09.64,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that might start to tell us what is happening in concussion.

128
0:06:12.52,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So please watch this video.

129
0:06:15.28,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Announcer: Cougars bring extra people late, but Luck has time,

130
0:06:18.72,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and Winslow is crushed.

131
0:06:22.12,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I hope he's all right.

132
0:06:23.72,000 --> 0:06:24,000
(Audience roars)

133
0:06:30.56,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Top of your screen,

134
0:06:32.04,000 --> 0:06:34,000
you'll see him come on just this little post route,

135
0:06:34.48,000 --> 0:06:35,000
get separation, safety.

136
0:06:40.24,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Here it comes at you in real speed. You'll hear this.

137
0:06:44.64,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The hit delivered by --

138
0:06:47.72,000 --> 0:06:5,000
David Camarillo: Sorry, three times is probably a little excessive there.

139
0:06:51.2,000 --> 0:06:52,000
But you get the idea.

140
0:06:52.48,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So when you look at just the film here,

141
0:06:55.32,000 --> 0:06:58,000
pretty much the only thing you can see is he got hit really hard and he was hurt.

142
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
But when we extract the data

143
0:07:00.84,000 --> 0:07:02,000
out of the mouthguard that he was wearing,

144
0:07:02.864,000 --> 0:07:04,000
we can see much more detail, much richer information.

145
0:07:05.6,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And one of the things that we noticed here

146
0:07:08.04,000 --> 0:07:12,000
is that he was struck in the lower left side of his face mask.

147
0:07:12.12,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And so that did something first that was a little counterintuitive.

148
0:07:15.32,000 --> 0:07:16,000
His head did not move to the right.

149
0:07:17.04,000 --> 0:07:18,000
In fact, it rotated first to the left.

150
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Then as the neck began to compress,

151
0:07:21.88,000 --> 0:07:24,000
the force of the blow caused it to whip back to the right.

152
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So this left-right motion was sort of a whiplash-type phenomenon,

153
0:07:30.88,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and we think that is probably what led to the brain injury.

154
0:07:35.32,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Now, this device is only limited in such that it can measure the skull motion,

155
0:07:39.12,000 --> 0:07:42,000
but what we really want to know is what's happening inside of the brain.

156
0:07:42.56,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So we collaborate with Svein Kleiven's group in Sweden.

157
0:07:46.08,000 --> 0:07:49,000
They've developed a finite element model of the brain.

158
0:07:49.68,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And so this is a simulation

159
0:07:51.8,000 --> 0:07:54,000
using the data from our mouthguard from the injury I just showed you,

160
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and what you see is the brain --

161
0:07:57.2,000 --> 0:07:59,000
this is a cross-section right in the front

162
0:07:59.64,000 --> 0:08:01,000
of the brain twisting and contorting as I mentioned.

163
0:08:02.44,000 --> 0:08:04,000
So you can see this doesn't look a lot like the CDC video.

164
0:08:05.36,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Now, the colors that you're looking at

165
0:08:07.24,000 --> 0:08:11,000
are how much the brain tissue is being stretched.

166
0:08:11.4,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And so the red is 50 percent.

167
0:08:13.12,000 --> 0:08:16,000
That means the brain has been stretched to 50 percent of its original length,

168
0:08:16.8,000 --> 0:08:17,000
the tissue in that particular area.

169
0:08:18.52,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And the main thing I want to draw your attention to is this red spot.

170
0:08:21.8,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So the red spot is very close to the center of the brain,

171
0:08:25.28,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and relatively speaking,

172
0:08:26.56,000 --> 0:08:3,000
you don't see a lot of colors like that on the exterior surface

173
0:08:31.24,000 --> 0:08:33,000
as the CDC video showed.

174
0:08:34.96,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Now, to explain a little more detail

175
0:08:36.72,000 --> 0:08:39,000
about how we think concussion might be happening,

176
0:08:40.36,000 --> 0:08:41,000
one thing I should mention

177
0:08:41.68,000 --> 0:08:44,000
is that we and others have observed that a concussion is more likely

178
0:08:44.919,000 --> 0:08:47,000
when you're struck and your head rotates in this direction.

179
0:08:48.919,000 --> 0:08:5,000
This is more common in sports like football,

180
0:08:51.2,000 --> 0:08:54,000
but this seems to be more dangerous. So what might be happening there?

181
0:08:54.559,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Well, one thing that you'll notice in the human brain

182
0:08:57.6,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that is different than other animals

183
0:08:59.36,000 --> 0:09:01,000
is we have these two very large lobes.

184
0:09:01.84,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We have the right brain and the left brain.

185
0:09:04.08,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And the key thing to notice in this figure here

186
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
is that right down the center of the right brain and the left brain

187
0:09:10.44,000 --> 0:09:12,000
there's a large fissure that goes deep into the brain.

188
0:09:13.4,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And in that fissure, what you can't see in this image,

189
0:09:16.28,000 --> 0:09:17,000
you'll have to trust me,

190
0:09:17.52,000 --> 0:09:18,000
there is a fibrous sheet of tissue.

191
0:09:19.24,000 --> 0:09:2,000
It's called the falx,

192
0:09:20.48,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and it runs from the front of your head all the way to the back of your head,

193
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and it's quite stiff.

194
0:09:25.4,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And so what that allows for is when you're struck

195
0:09:28.88,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and your head rotates in this left-right direction,

196
0:09:31.96,000 --> 0:09:34,000
forces can rapidly transmit right down to the center of your brain.

197
0:09:35.76,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Now, what's there at the bottom of this fissure?

198
0:09:39.12,000 --> 0:09:41,000
It's the wiring of your brain,

199
0:09:41.64,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and in fact this red bundle here at the bottom of that fissure

200
0:09:46.28,000 --> 0:09:48,000
is the single largest fiber bundle

201
0:09:49.28,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that is the wiring that connects the right and left sides of your brain.

202
0:09:53.28,000 --> 0:09:54,000
It's called the corpus callosum.

203
0:09:55.48,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And we think that this might be

204
0:09:57.44,000 --> 0:10:,000
one of the most common mechanisms of concussion,

205
0:10:01.28,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and as the forces move down, they strike the corpus callosum,

206
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:08,000
it causes a dissociation between your right and your left brain

207
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and could explain some of the symptoms of concussion.

208
0:10:12.68,000 --> 0:10:14,000
This finding is also consistent of what we've seen

209
0:10:15.52,000 --> 0:10:19,000
in this brain disease that I mentioned, chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

210
0:10:19.56,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So this is an image of a middle-aged ex-professional football player,

211
0:10:25.12,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and the thing that I want to point out is if you look at the corpus callosum,

212
0:10:29.12,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and I'll page back here so you can see the size of a normal corpus callosum

213
0:10:33.08,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and the size of the person here who has chronic traumatic encephalopathy,

214
0:10:37.52,000 --> 0:10:39,000
it is greatly atrophied.

215
0:10:40.08,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And the same goes for all of the space in the ventricles.

216
0:10:43.44,000 --> 0:10:44,000
These ventricles are much larger.

217
0:10:45.24,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And so all of this tissue near the center of the brain

218
0:10:47.8,000 --> 0:10:48,000
has died off over time.

219
0:10:49.04,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So what we're learning is indeed consistent.

220
0:10:53.52,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Now, there is some good news here,

221
0:10:56.2,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and I hope to give you a sense of hope by the end of this talk.

222
0:10:59.68,000 --> 0:11:01,000
One of the things that we've noticed,

223
0:11:01.8,000 --> 0:11:03,000
specifically about this mechanism of injury,

224
0:11:04.08,000 --> 0:11:08,000
is although there's a rapid transmission of the forces down this fissure,

225
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
it still takes a defined amount of time.

226
0:11:11.48,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And what we think is that if we can slow the head down just enough

227
0:11:15.84,000 --> 0:11:18,000
so that the brain does not lag behind the skull

228
0:11:19.08,000 --> 0:11:22,000
but instead it moves in synchrony with the skull,

229
0:11:22.68,000 --> 0:11:25,000
then we might be able to prevent this mechanism of concussion.

230
0:11:25.96,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So how can we slow the head down?

231
0:11:30.64,000 --> 0:11:31,000
(Laughter)

232
0:11:32.4,000 --> 0:11:33,000
A gigantic helmet.

233
0:11:35.44,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So with more space, you have more time,

234
0:11:38.32,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and this is a bit of a joke, but some of you may have seen this.

235
0:11:41.44,000 --> 0:11:43,000
This is bubble soccer, and it's a real sport.

236
0:11:43.76,000 --> 0:11:44,000
In fact, I saw some young adults

237
0:11:45.44,000 --> 0:11:47,000
playing this sport down the street from my house the other day,

238
0:11:48.44,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and as far as I know there have been no reported concussions.

239
0:11:51.36,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Laughter)

240
0:11:52.4,000 --> 0:11:56,000
But in all seriousness, this principle does work,

241
0:11:56.84,000 --> 0:11:57,000
but this has gone too far.

242
0:11:58.24,000 --> 0:12:03,000
This isn't something that's practical for bike riding or playing football.

243
0:12:03.52,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And so we are collaborating with a company in Sweden called Hövding.

244
0:12:07.92,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Some of you may have seen their work,

245
0:12:10.28,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and they're using the same principle of air to give you some extra space

246
0:12:14.68,000 --> 0:12:15,000
to prevent concussion.

247
0:12:17.32,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Kids, don't try this at home please.

248
0:12:20.68,000 --> 0:12:22,000
This stuntman does not have a helmet.

249
0:12:24.2,000 --> 0:12:26,000
He instead has a neck collar,

250
0:12:26.48,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and this neck collar has sensors in it,

251
0:12:29.08,000 --> 0:12:32,000
the same type of sensors that are in our mouthguard,

252
0:12:32.68,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and it detects when he's likely to have a fall,

253
0:12:35.84,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and there's an airbag that explodes and triggers,

254
0:12:38.2,000 --> 0:12:41,000
the same way that an airbag works in your car, essentially.

255
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And in the experiments we've done in my lab with their device,

256
0:12:44.96,000 --> 0:12:47,000
we found that it can greatly reduce the risk of concussion in some scenarios

257
0:12:48.72,000 --> 0:12:5,000
compared to a normal bicycle helmet.

258
0:12:50.88,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So it's a pretty exciting development.

259
0:12:53.72,000 --> 0:12:57,000
But in order for us to actually realize the benefits of technology

260
0:12:58.44,000 --> 0:12:59,000
that can prevent concussion,

261
0:13:00.32,000 --> 0:13:02,000
it needs to meet regulations.

262
0:13:03.28,000 --> 0:13:04,000
That's a reality.

263
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And this device is for sale in Europe

264
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
but is not for sale in the US, and probably won't be any time soon.

265
0:13:11.88,000 --> 0:13:12,000
So I wanted to tell you why.

266
0:13:13.44,000 --> 0:13:16,000
There are some good reasons and then there are some not so good reasons.

267
0:13:17.24,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Bike helmets are federally regulated.

268
0:13:19.48,000 --> 0:13:22,000
The Consumer Product Safety Commission has been given jurisdiction

269
0:13:23.24,000 --> 0:13:24,000
to approve any bike helmet for sale,

270
0:13:25.12,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and this is the test they use.

271
0:13:26.6,000 --> 0:13:29,000
This is back to what I was telling you at the beginning about skull fracture.

272
0:13:30.28,000 --> 0:13:31,000
That's what this test is for.

273
0:13:31.72,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And that's an important thing to do.

274
0:13:33.48,000 --> 0:13:35,000
It can save your life, but it's not sufficient, I would say.

275
0:13:36.36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
So for example, one thing this test doesn't evaluate

276
0:13:39.12,000 --> 0:13:41,000
is it doesn't tell you is that airbag going to trigger

277
0:13:41.96,000 --> 0:13:44,000
at the right time and place, and not trigger when it doesn't need to?

278
0:13:45.88,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Similarly, it's not going to tell you

279
0:13:47.96,000 --> 0:13:5,000
is this helmet likely to prevent concussion or not?

280
0:13:51.36,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And if you look at football helmets, which aren't regulated,

281
0:13:55.12,000 --> 0:13:57,000
they still have a very similar test.

282
0:13:57.52,000 --> 0:13:59,000
They're not regulated by the government, anyway.

283
0:13:59.8,000 --> 0:14:02,000
They have an industry body, which is the way most industries work.

284
0:14:02.96,000 --> 0:14:05,000
But this industry body, I can tell you, has been quite resistant

285
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:07,000
to updating their standards.

286
0:14:07.4,000 --> 0:14:1,000
So in my lab, we are working on not only the mechanism of concussion,

287
0:14:10.68,000 --> 0:14:13,000
but we want to understand how can we have better test standards?

288
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And we hope that the government can use this type of information

289
0:14:18.72,000 --> 0:14:19,000
to encourage innovation

290
0:14:20.48,000 --> 0:14:21,000
by letting consumers know

291
0:14:22.12,000 --> 0:14:25,000
how protected are you with a given helmet.

292
0:14:25.92,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And I want to bring this back finally to the original question I asked,

293
0:14:29.32,000 --> 0:14:32,000
which is, would I feel comfortable letting my child play football

294
0:14:32.68,000 --> 0:14:33,000
or ride a bicycle?

295
0:14:34.44,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And this might be just a result of my own traumatic experience.

296
0:14:37.8,000 --> 0:14:41,000
I'm much more nervous about my daughter, Rose, riding a bicycle.

297
0:14:42.92,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So she's a year and a half old,

298
0:14:44.6,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and she's already, well, wants to anyway, race down the streets of San Francisco.

299
0:14:50.08,000 --> 0:14:52,000
This is the bottom of one of these streets.

300
0:14:52.44,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And so my personal goal is to -- and I believe this is possible --

301
0:14:57.68,000 --> 0:14:59,000
is to further develop these technologies,

302
0:14:59.76,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and in fact, we're working on something in my lab in particular

303
0:15:02.76,000 --> 0:15:04,000
that really makes optimal use of the given space of a helmet.

304
0:15:05.737,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And I am confident that we will be able to,

305
0:15:08.24,000 --> 0:15:11,000
before she's ready to ride a two-wheeler,

306
0:15:11.48,000 --> 0:15:12,000
have something available

307
0:15:12.88,000 --> 0:15:15,000
that can in fact really reduce the risk of concussion

308
0:15:16.24,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and comply with regulatory bodies.

309
0:15:19.4,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And so what I'd like to do --

310
0:15:21.04,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and I know that this is for some of you of more immediate nature,

311
0:15:24.44,000 --> 0:15:25,000
I've got a couple years here --

312
0:15:26.12,000 --> 0:15:3,000
is to be able to tell parents and grandparents when I'm asked,

313
0:15:30.28,000 --> 0:15:34,000
it is safe and healthy for your children to engage in these activities.

314
0:15:34.72,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And I'm very fortunate to have a wonderful team at Stanford

315
0:15:37.56,000 --> 0:15:38,000
that's working hard on this.

316
0:15:39.48,000 --> 0:15:43,000
So I hope to come back in a few years with the final story,

317
0:15:43.6,000 --> 0:15:44,000
but for now I will tell you,

318
0:15:45.6,000 --> 0:15:47,000
please don't just be afraid when you hear the word concussion.

319
0:15:48.56,000 --> 0:15:49,000
There is hope.

320
0:15:49.8,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Thank you.

321
0:15:51.04,000 --> 0:15:55,000

1
0:00:12.661,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Nearly 100 years ago,

2
0:00:15.396,000 --> 0:00:16,000
almost today,

3
0:00:16.85,000 --> 0:00:19,000
most women in the United States finally won the right to vote.

4
0:00:20.862,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Now, it would take decades more for women of color to earn that right,

5
0:00:26.526,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and we've come a long way since,

6
0:00:28.25,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but I would argue not nearly far enough.

7
0:00:32.077,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I think what women want today,

8
0:00:33.627,000 --> 0:00:36,000
not just only in the United States but around the globe,

9
0:00:36.698,000 --> 0:00:38,000
is to no longer be an afterthought.

10
0:00:40.001,000 --> 0:00:43,000
We don't want to continue to try to, like, look at the next 100 years

11
0:00:43.693,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and be granted, grudgingly, small legal rights and accommodations.

12
0:00:48.629,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We simply want true and full equality.

13
0:00:52.49,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I think that women are tired of retrofitting ourselves

14
0:00:55.196,000 --> 0:00:59,000
into institutions and governments that were built by men, for men,

15
0:00:59.84,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and we'd rather reshape the future on our own terms.

16
0:01:05.138,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I believe --

17
0:01:06.312,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Applause)

18
0:01:09.64,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I believe what we need is a women's political revolution for full equality

19
0:01:14.156,000 --> 0:01:18,000
across race, across class, across gender identity,

20
0:01:18.586,000 --> 0:01:19,000
across sexual orientation,

21
0:01:20.154,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and yes, across political labels,

22
0:01:22.523,000 --> 0:01:25,000
because I believe what binds us together as women

23
0:01:25.823,000 --> 0:01:28,000
is so much more profound than what keeps up apart.

24
0:01:29.711,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And so I've given some thought

25
0:01:31.201,000 --> 0:01:33,000
about how to build this women's political revolution

26
0:01:33.721,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and that's what I want to talk to you about today.

27
0:01:36.311,000 --> 0:01:38,000
(Cheers)

28
0:01:38.494,000 --> 0:01:4,000
(Applause)

29
0:01:40.593,000 --> 0:01:44,000
The good news is that one thing that hasn't changed in the last century

30
0:01:44.631,000 --> 0:01:45,000
is women's resilience

31
0:01:46.219,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and our commitment to build a better life not only for ourselves,

32
0:01:49.489,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but for generations to come,

33
0:01:51.55,000 --> 0:01:53,000
because I can't think of a single woman

34
0:01:53.718,000 --> 0:01:54,000
who wants her daughter

35
0:01:55.14,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to have fewer rights or opportunities than she's had.

36
0:01:59.531,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So we know we all stand on the shoulders of the women who came before us,

37
0:02:04.456,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and as for myself,

38
0:02:05.631,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I come from a long line of tough Texas women.

39
0:02:08.566,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Cheers)

40
0:02:10.727,000 --> 0:02:12,000
My grandparents lived outside of Waco, Texas,

41
0:02:13.56,000 --> 0:02:14,000
in the country.

42
0:02:15.062,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And when my grandmother got pregnant,

43
0:02:17.417,000 --> 0:02:19,000
of course she was not going to go to the hospital to deliver,

44
0:02:20.404,000 --> 0:02:22,000
she was going to have that baby at home.

45
0:02:22.589,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But when she went into labor,

46
0:02:24.041,000 --> 0:02:27,000
she called the neighbor woman over to cook dinner for my grandfather,

47
0:02:27.907,000 --> 0:02:28,000
because ...

48
0:02:29.334,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I mean, it was unthinkable that he was going to make supper for himself.

49
0:02:32.753,000 --> 0:02:33,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:34.531,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Been there.

51
0:02:37.166,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:40.304,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The neighbor had no experience with killing a chicken,

53
0:02:42.9,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and that was what was planned for dinner that night.

54
0:02:45.823,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And so as the story goes,

55
0:02:48.14,000 --> 0:02:51,000
my grandmother, in the birthing bed, in labor,

56
0:02:51.583,000 --> 0:02:55,000
hoists herself up on one elbow and wrings that chicken's neck, right?

57
0:02:55.955,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And that is how my mother came into this world.

58
0:02:58.236,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:59.734,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Applause)

60
0:03:03.608,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But the amazing thing is,

61
0:03:05.514,000 --> 0:03:08,000
even though my mother's own grandmother could not vote in Texas,

62
0:03:08.788,000 --> 0:03:1,000
because under Texas law,

63
0:03:10.866,000 --> 0:03:14,000
"idiots, imbeciles, the insane and women"

64
0:03:15.64,000 --> 0:03:17,000
were prevented the franchise --

65
0:03:17.869,000 --> 0:03:18,000
just two generations later,

66
0:03:19.724,000 --> 0:03:23,000
my mother, Ann Richards, was elected the first woman governor in her own right

67
0:03:24.132,000 --> 0:03:25,000
in the state of Texas.

68
0:03:25.361,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Applause and cheers)

69
0:03:32.341,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But you see, when Mom was coming up in Texas,

70
0:03:35.841,000 --> 0:03:37,000
there weren't a lot of opportunities for women,

71
0:03:38.237,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and frankly, she spent her entire life trying to change that.

72
0:03:42.341,000 --> 0:03:43,000
She used to like to say,

73
0:03:43.825,000 --> 0:03:46,000
"As women, if you just give us a chance, we can perform.

74
0:03:47.705,000 --> 0:03:5,000
After all, Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did,

75
0:03:51.625,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but she did it backwards and in high heels."

76
0:03:53.989,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Right?

77
0:03:55.356,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And honestly, that's kind of what women have been doing for this last century:

78
0:03:59.286,000 --> 0:04:02,000
despite having very, very little political power,

79
0:04:02.488,000 --> 0:04:04,000
we have made enormous progress.

80
0:04:04.948,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So today in the United States,

81
0:04:06.408,000 --> 0:04:08,000
100 years after getting the right to vote,

82
0:04:08.46,000 --> 0:04:09,000
women are almost half the workforce.

83
0:04:10.641,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And in 40 percent of families with children,

84
0:04:13.578,000 --> 0:04:14,000
women are the major breadwinners.

85
0:04:16.218,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Economists even estimate

86
0:04:17.538,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that if every single paid working woman took just one day off of work,

87
0:04:22.186,000 --> 0:04:25,000
it would cost the United States 21 billion dollars

88
0:04:25.6,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in gross domestic product.

89
0:04:28.139,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Now, largely because of Title IX, which required educational equity,

90
0:04:32.849,000 --> 0:04:35,000
women are actually now half the college students in the United States.

91
0:04:36.246,000 --> 0:04:38,000
We're half the medical students, we're half the law students --

92
0:04:39.247,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Exactly.

93
0:04:40.422,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Applause)

94
0:04:41.597,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And a fact I absolutely love:

95
0:04:43.971,000 --> 0:04:47,000
One of the most recent classes of graduating NASA astronauts was ...

96
0:04:48.228,000 --> 0:04:49,000
What?

97
0:04:49.403,000 --> 0:04:5,000
For the first time, 50 percent women.

98
0:04:51.226,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Applause and cheers)

99
0:04:54.603,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The point is that women are really changing industries,

100
0:04:57.627,000 --> 0:04:59,000
they're changing business from the inside out.

101
0:05:01.209,000 --> 0:05:04,000
But when it comes to government, it's another story,

102
0:05:04.515,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and I actually think a picture is worth 1000 words.

103
0:05:07.933,000 --> 0:05:1,000
This is a photograph from 2017 at the White House

104
0:05:11.291,000 --> 0:05:14,000
when congressional leaders were called over to put the final details

105
0:05:15.188,000 --> 0:05:18,000
into the health-care reform bill that was to go to Congress.

106
0:05:18.283,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Now, one of the results of this meeting

107
0:05:20.769,000 --> 0:05:22,000
was that they got rid of maternity benefits,

108
0:05:23.718,000 --> 0:05:24,000
which may not be that surprising,

109
0:05:25.365,000 --> 0:05:28,000
since no one at that table actually would need maternity benefits.

110
0:05:29.241,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And unfortunately, that's what we've learned the hard way

111
0:05:31.964,000 --> 0:05:32,000
in the US for women.

112
0:05:33.245,000 --> 0:05:36,000
If we're not at the table, we're on the menu, right?

113
0:05:36.829,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And we're simply not at enough tables,

114
0:05:42.575,000 --> 0:05:44,000
because even though women are the vast majority of voters

115
0:05:45.316,000 --> 0:05:46,000
in the United States,

116
0:05:46.491,000 --> 0:05:49,000
we fall far behind the rest of the world in political representation.

117
0:05:50.591,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Recent research is that when they ranked all the countries,

118
0:05:54.607,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the United States is 104th in women's representation in office.

119
0:05:59.177,000 --> 0:06:01,000
104th ...

120
0:06:02.026,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Right behind Indonesia.

121
0:06:04.836,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So is it any big surprise, then,

122
0:06:07.112,000 --> 0:06:08,000
considering who's making decisions,

123
0:06:08.965,000 --> 0:06:1,000
we're the only developed country with no paid family leave?

124
0:06:12.711,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And despite all the research and improvements we've made

125
0:06:15.53,000 --> 0:06:16,000
in medical care --

126
0:06:16.991,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and this is really horrifying to me --

127
0:06:19.134,000 --> 0:06:23,000
the United States now leads the developed world in maternal mortality rates.

128
0:06:24.697,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Now, when it comes to equal pay, we're not doing a whole lot better.

129
0:06:27.965,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Women now, on average, in the United States,

130
0:06:30.101,000 --> 0:06:33,000
still only make 80 cents to the dollar that a man makes.

131
0:06:33.156,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Though if you're an African American woman,

132
0:06:35.223,000 --> 0:06:37,000
it's 63 cents to the dollar.

133
0:06:37.549,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And if you're Latina, it's 54 cents to the dollar.

134
0:06:41.35,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It's an outrage.

135
0:06:42.949,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Now, women in the UK, the United Kingdom,

136
0:06:45.305,000 --> 0:06:47,000
just came up with something I thought was rather ingenious,

137
0:06:48.136,000 --> 0:06:5,000
in order to illustrate the impact of the pay gap.

138
0:06:51.001,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So, starting November 10 and going through the end of the year,

139
0:06:54.941,000 --> 0:06:56,000
they simply put an out-of-office memo on their email

140
0:06:57.726,000 --> 0:07:,000
to indicate all the weeks they were working without pay.

141
0:07:01.116,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Right?

142
0:07:02.291,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I think it's an idea that actually could catch on.

143
0:07:05.885,000 --> 0:07:08,000
But imagine if women actually had political power.

144
0:07:09.569,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Imagine if we were at the table, making decisions.

145
0:07:14.537,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Imagine if we had our own women's political party

146
0:07:17.303,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that instead of putting our issues to the side as distractions,

147
0:07:20.452,000 --> 0:07:22,000
made them the top priority.

148
0:07:23.947,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Well, we know --

149
0:07:25.269,000 --> 0:07:27,000
research shows that when women are in office,

150
0:07:27.402,000 --> 0:07:29,000
they actually act differently than men.

151
0:07:30.546,000 --> 0:07:32,000
They collaborate more with their colleagues,

152
0:07:32.831,000 --> 0:07:34,000
they work across party lines,

153
0:07:35.12,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and women are much more likely to support legislation

154
0:07:37.831,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that improves access to health care, education, civil rights.

155
0:07:42.839,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And what we've seen in our research in the United States Congress

156
0:07:45.94,000 --> 0:07:47,000
is that women sponsor more legislation

157
0:07:48.132,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and they cosponsor more legislation.

158
0:07:49.951,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So all the evidence is that when women actually have the chance to serve,

159
0:07:53.729,000 --> 0:07:56,000
they make a huge difference and they get the job done.

160
0:07:57.155,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So how would it look in the United States if different people were making decisions?

161
0:08:02.23,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Well, I firmly believe if half of Congress could get pregnant,

162
0:08:05.792,000 --> 0:08:07,000
we would finally quit fighting about birth control

163
0:08:08.244,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and Planned Parenthood.

164
0:08:09.453,000 --> 0:08:1,000
(Applause and cheers)

165
0:08:10.623,000 --> 0:08:11,000
That would be over.

166
0:08:11.798,000 --> 0:08:16,000
(Applause)

167
0:08:16.894,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I also really believe that finally,

168
0:08:19.316,000 --> 0:08:23,000
businesses might quit treating pregnancy as a nuisance,

169
0:08:24.237,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and rather understand it as a primary medical issue

170
0:08:27.375,000 --> 0:08:29,000
for millions of American workers.

171
0:08:30.573,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And I think if more women were in office,

172
0:08:33.153,000 --> 0:08:37,000
our government would actually prioritize keeping families together

173
0:08:37.479,000 --> 0:08:38,000
rather than pulling them apart.

174
0:08:39.289,000 --> 0:08:42,000
(Applause)

175
0:08:43.096,000 --> 0:08:46,000
But perhaps most importantly,

176
0:08:46.344,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I think all of these issues would no longer be seen as "women's issues."

177
0:08:50.396,000 --> 0:08:53,000
They would just be seen as basic issues of fairness and equality

178
0:08:53.922,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that everybody can get behind.

179
0:08:58.153,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So I think the question is,

180
0:08:59.548,000 --> 0:09:03,000
what would it take, actually, to build this women's political revolution?

181
0:09:04.335,000 --> 0:09:07,000
The good news is, actually, it's already started.

182
0:09:08.397,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Because women around the globe are demanding workplaces,

183
0:09:11.476,000 --> 0:09:14,000
they're demanding educational institutions,

184
0:09:14.901,000 --> 0:09:15,000
they're demanding governments

185
0:09:16.425,000 --> 0:09:2,000
where sexism and sexual harassment and sexual assault are neither accepted

186
0:09:21.366,000 --> 0:09:22,000
nor tolerated.

187
0:09:22.849,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Women around the world, as we know,

188
0:09:24.621,000 --> 0:09:27,000
are raising their hands and saying, "Me Too,"

189
0:09:27.772,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and it's a movement that's made so much more powerful

190
0:09:30.443,000 --> 0:09:33,000
by the fact that women are standing together across industries,

191
0:09:33.775,000 --> 0:09:36,000
from domestic workers to celebrities in Hollywood.

192
0:09:38.417,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Women are marching, we're sitting in,

193
0:09:41.554,000 --> 0:09:42,000
we're speaking up.

194
0:09:42.868,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Women are challenging the status quo,

195
0:09:45.335,000 --> 0:09:46,000
we're busting old taboos

196
0:09:47.266,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and yes, we are proudly making trouble.

197
0:09:50.266,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So, women in Saudi Arabia are driving for the very first time.

198
0:09:54.759,000 --> 0:09:56,000
(Applause and cheers)

199
0:09:57.228,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Women in Iraq are standing in solidarity with survivors of human trafficking.

200
0:10:02.32,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And women from El Salvador to Ireland are fighting for reproductive rights.

201
0:10:07.479,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And women in Myanmar are standing up for human rights.

202
0:10:11.805,000 --> 0:10:14,000
In short, I think the most profound leadership in the world

203
0:10:15.492,000 --> 0:10:16,000
isn't coming from halls of government.

204
0:10:17.338,000 --> 0:10:2,000
It's coming from women at the grassroots all across the globe.

205
0:10:20.872,000 --> 0:10:23,000
(Applause)

206
0:10:24.489,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And here in the United States, women are on fire.

207
0:10:29.766,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So a recent Kaiser poll reported

208
0:10:32.541,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that since our last presidential election in 2016,

209
0:10:36.661,000 --> 0:10:4,000
one in five Americans have either marched or taken part in a protest,

210
0:10:40.706,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and the number one issue has been women's rights.

211
0:10:43.95,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Women are starting new organizations,

212
0:10:46.1,000 --> 0:10:48,000
they are volunteering on campaigns,

213
0:10:48.839,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and they're taking on every issue

214
0:10:50.883,000 --> 0:10:53,000
from gun-safety reform to public education.

215
0:10:55.323,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And women are running for office in record numbers,

216
0:10:58.394,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and they are winning.

217
0:10:59.907,000 --> 0:11:,000
So -- (Laughs)

218
0:11:01.119,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Applause)

219
0:11:02.474,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Women like Lucy McBath from Georgia.

220
0:11:06.499,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Applause and cheers)

221
0:11:10.455,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Lucy lost her son to gun violence,

222
0:11:14.764,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and it was because of her experience with the criminal justice system

223
0:11:18.733,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that she realized just how broken it is,

224
0:11:20.998,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and she decided to do something about that.

225
0:11:23.795,000 --> 0:11:24,000
So she ran for office,

226
0:11:25.467,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and this January, she's going to Congress.

227
0:11:28.038,000 --> 0:11:29,000
OK? Or --

228
0:11:30.043,000 --> 0:11:31,000
(Applause)

229
0:11:31.453,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Angie Craig from Minnesota.

230
0:11:33.89,000 --> 0:11:34,000
(Applause and cheers)

231
0:11:35.015,000 --> 0:11:4,000
So her congressman had made such hateful comments about LGBTQ people

232
0:11:40.992,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that she decided to challenge him.

233
0:11:43.505,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And you know what? She did, and she won,

234
0:11:46.011,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and when she goes to Congress in January,

235
0:11:47.988,000 --> 0:11:5,000
she'll be the first lesbian mother serving in the House of Representatives.

236
0:11:51.537,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Applause and cheers)

237
0:11:53.346,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Or --

238
0:11:54.541,000 --> 0:11:55,000
(Applause)

239
0:11:56.101,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Or Lauren Underwood from Illinois.

240
0:11:59.423,000 --> 0:12:,000
She's a registered nurse,

241
0:12:01.132,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and she sees every day the impact that lack of health care access has

242
0:12:05.657,000 --> 0:12:07,000
on the community where she lives,

243
0:12:07.858,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and so she decided to run.

244
0:12:09.777,000 --> 0:12:12,000
She took on six men in her primary, she beat them all,

245
0:12:12.874,000 --> 0:12:13,000
she won the general election,

246
0:12:14.281,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and when she goes to Congress in January,

247
0:12:16.258,000 --> 0:12:18,000
she's going to be the first African-American woman ever

248
0:12:18.86,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to serve her district in Washington, D.C.

249
0:12:20.879,000 --> 0:12:23,000
(Applause and cheers)

250
0:12:24.033,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So women are recognizing --

251
0:12:27.279,000 --> 0:12:28,000
this is our moment.

252
0:12:28.723,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Don't wait for permission,

253
0:12:29.986,000 --> 0:12:3,000
don't wait for your turn.

254
0:12:32.859,000 --> 0:12:35,000
As the late, great Shirley Chisholm said --

255
0:12:36.412,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman ever

256
0:12:39.008,000 --> 0:12:4,000
to go to Congress

257
0:12:40.3,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and the first woman to run for president in the Democratic party --

258
0:12:44.047,000 --> 0:12:46,000
but Shirley Chisholm said,

259
0:12:46.514,000 --> 0:12:49,000
"If there's no room for you at the table, just pull up a folding chair."

260
0:12:50.039,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And that's what women are doing, all across the country.

261
0:12:55.664,000 --> 0:12:59,000
I believe women are now the most important and powerful political force

262
0:12:59.777,000 --> 0:13:,000
in the world,

263
0:13:01.35,000 --> 0:13:04,000
but how do we make sure that this is not just a moment?

264
0:13:04.927,000 --> 0:13:09,000
What we need is actually a global movement for women's full equality

265
0:13:10.383,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that is intersectional and it's intergenerational,

266
0:13:13.068,000 --> 0:13:14,000
where no one gets left behind.

267
0:13:15.117,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And so I have a few ideas about how we could do that.

268
0:13:18.838,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Number one: it's not enough to resist.

269
0:13:21.078,000 --> 0:13:23,000
It's not enough to say what we're against.

270
0:13:23.194,000 --> 0:13:26,000
It's time to be loud and proud about what we are for,

271
0:13:26.491,000 --> 0:13:29,000
because being for full equality is a mainstream value

272
0:13:29.689,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and something that we can get behind.

273
0:13:31.716,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Because actually, men support equal pay for women.

274
0:13:34.869,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Millennials, they support gender equality.

275
0:13:37.622,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And businesses are increasingly adopting family-friendly policies,

276
0:13:42.046,000 --> 0:13:44,000
not just because it's the right thing to do,

277
0:13:44.177,000 --> 0:13:45,000
but because it's good for their workers.

278
0:13:46.106,000 --> 0:13:47,000
It's good for their business.

279
0:13:48.555,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Number two:

280
0:13:50.278,000 --> 0:13:53,000
We have to remember, in the words of Fannie Lou Hamer,

281
0:13:53.765,000 --> 0:13:56,000
that "nobody's free 'til everybody's free."

282
0:13:57.665,000 --> 0:13:58,000
So as I mentioned earlier,

283
0:13:59.312,000 --> 0:14:02,000
women of color in this country didn't even get the right to vote

284
0:14:02.842,000 --> 0:14:04,000
until much further along than the rest of us.

285
0:14:06.257,000 --> 0:14:08,000
But since they did, they are the most reliable voters,

286
0:14:09.236,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and women of color are the most reliable voters for candidates

287
0:14:12.182,000 --> 0:14:13,000
who support women's rights,

288
0:14:13.529,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and we need to follow their lead --

289
0:14:15.295,000 --> 0:14:2,000
(Applause and cheers)

290
0:14:20.566,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Because their issues are our issues.

291
0:14:23.414,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And as white women, we have to do more,

292
0:14:26.226,000 --> 0:14:29,000
because racism and sexism and homophobia,

293
0:14:29.369,000 --> 0:14:31,000
these are issues that affect all of us.

294
0:14:32.551,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Number three: we've got to vote in every single election.

295
0:14:35.882,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Every election.

296
0:14:37.057,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And we've got to make it easier for folks to vote,

297
0:14:39.886,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and we've got to make sure that every single vote is counted, OK?

298
0:14:43.318,000 --> 0:14:45,000
(Applause and cheers)

299
0:14:46.19,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Because the barriers that exist to voting in the United States,

300
0:14:51.794,000 --> 0:14:53,000
they fall disproportionately on women --

301
0:14:54.399,000 --> 0:14:56,000
women of color, women with low incomes,

302
0:14:56.746,000 --> 0:14:58,000
women who are working and trying to raise a family.

303
0:15:00.069,000 --> 0:15:03,000
So we need to make it easier for everyone to vote,

304
0:15:03.253,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and we can start by making Election Day a federal holiday

305
0:15:06.722,000 --> 0:15:07,000
in the United States of America.

306
0:15:08.291,000 --> 0:15:13,000
(Applause and cheers)

307
0:15:13.485,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Number four: don't wait for instructions.

308
0:15:16.21,000 --> 0:15:18,000
If you see a problem that needs fixing,

309
0:15:18.617,000 --> 0:15:2,000
I think you're the one to do it, OK?

310
0:15:21.624,000 --> 0:15:25,000
So start a new organization, run for office.

311
0:15:25.719,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Or maybe it's as simple as standing up on the job in support of yourself

312
0:15:30.353,000 --> 0:15:31,000
or your coworkers.

313
0:15:31.531,000 --> 0:15:32,000
This is up to all of us.

314
0:15:33.654,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And number five: invest in women, all right?

315
0:15:38.155,000 --> 0:15:39,000
(Applause)

316
0:15:39.327,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Invest in women as candidates, as changemakers, as leaders.

317
0:15:42.999,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Just as an example,

318
0:15:44.203,000 --> 0:15:46,000
in this last election cycle in the United States,

319
0:15:47.121,000 --> 0:15:51,000
women donated 100 million dollars more to candidates and campaigns

320
0:15:51.602,000 --> 0:15:52,000
than they had just two years ago,

321
0:15:53.494,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and a record number of women won.

322
0:15:55.89,000 --> 0:15:56,000
So just think about that.

323
0:15:57.157,000 --> 0:15:58,000
(Applause and cheers)

324
0:15:58.861,000 --> 0:16:03,000
So look, sometimes I think that the challenges we face,

325
0:16:03.966,000 --> 0:16:04,000
they seem overwhelming

326
0:16:05.339,000 --> 0:16:08,000
and they seem like they almost can never be solved,

327
0:16:09.009,000 --> 0:16:12,000
but I think the problems that seem the most intractable

328
0:16:12.166,000 --> 0:16:14,000
are the ones that are most important to work on.

329
0:16:15.42,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And just because it hasn't been figured out yet doesn't mean you won't.

330
0:16:19.675,000 --> 0:16:21,000
After all, if women's work were easy,

331
0:16:21.856,000 --> 0:16:23,000
someone else would have already been doing it, right?

332
0:16:24.366,000 --> 0:16:25,000
(Laughter)

333
0:16:25.468,000 --> 0:16:28,000
But women around the globe, they're on the move,

334
0:16:29.231,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and they are taking strengths and inspiration from each other.

335
0:16:32.805,000 --> 0:16:34,000
They are doing things they never could have imagined.

336
0:16:35.804,000 --> 0:16:37,000
So if we could just take the progress we have made

337
0:16:38.326,000 --> 0:16:39,000
in joining the workforce,

338
0:16:39.956,000 --> 0:16:4,000
in joining business,

339
0:16:41.455,000 --> 0:16:43,000
in joining the educational system,

340
0:16:43.528,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and actually channel that into building true political power,

341
0:16:47.278,000 --> 0:16:49,000
we will reshape this century,

342
0:16:49.561,000 --> 0:16:51,000
because one of us can be ignored,

343
0:16:51.717,000 --> 0:16:52,000
two of us can be dismissed,

344
0:16:53.527,000 --> 0:16:55,000
but together, we're a movement,

345
0:16:55.661,000 --> 0:16:56,000
and we're unstoppable.

346
0:16:57.355,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Thank you.

347
0:16:58.587,000 --> 0:16:59,000
(Applause and cheers)

348
0:17:00.397,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Thank you.

349
0:17:01.579,000 --> 0:17:02,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Have you ever wanted to stay young a little longer

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and put off aging?

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
This is a dream of the ages.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But scientists have for a long time

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
thought this just was never going to be possible.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
They thought you just wear out, there's nothing you can do about it --

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
kind of like an old shoe.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But if you look in nature,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
you see that different kinds of animals

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
can have really different lifespans.

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Now these animals are different from one another,

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
because they have different genes.

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So that suggests

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that somewhere in these genes, somewhere in the DNA,

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
are genes for aging,

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
genes that allow them to have different lifespans.

17
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So if there are genes like that,

18
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
then you can imagine that,

19
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
if you could change one of the genes in an experiment,

20
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
an aging gene,

21
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan.

22
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And if you could do that, then you could find the genes for aging.

23
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And if they exist and you can find them,

24
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
then maybe one could eventually do something about it.

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So we've set out to look for genes that control aging.

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And we didn't study any of these animals.

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Instead, we studied a little, tiny, round worm called C. elegans,

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence.

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And we were really optimistic that we could find something

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
because there had been a report of a long-lived mutant.

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So we started to change genes at random,

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
looking for long-lived animals.

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And we were very lucky to find

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that mutations that damage one single gene called daf-2

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
doubled the lifespan of the little worm.

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So you can see in black, after a month --

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
they're very short-lived; that's why we like to study them

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
for studies of aging --

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
in black, after a month, the normal worms are all dead.

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But at that time,

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
most of the mutant worms are still alive.

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And it isn't until twice as long

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that they're all dead.

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
And now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here.

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So the first thing you're going to see

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
is the normal worm

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
when it's about college student age -- a young adult.

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It's quite a cute little fellow.

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And next you're going to see the long-lived mutant when it's young.

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So this animal is going to live twice as long.

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Is it miserable? It doesn't seem to be.

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It's active. You can't tell the difference really.

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And they can be completely fertile --

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
have the same number of progeny as the normal worms do.

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Now get out your handkerchiefs here.

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
You're going to see, in just two weeks,

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the normal worms are old.

58
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You can see the little head moving down at the bottom there.

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But everything else is just lying there.

60
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The animal's clearly in the nursing home.

61
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And if you look at the tissues of the animal, they're starting to deteriorate.

62
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
You know, even if you've never seen one of these little C. elegans --

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
which probably most of you haven't seen one --

64
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
you can tell they're old -- isn't that interesting?

65
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So there's something about aging that's kind of universal.

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And now here is the daf-2 mutant.

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
One gene is changed out of 20,000, and look at it.

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It's the same age, but it's not in the nursing home;

69
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
it's going skiing.

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
This is what's really cool: it's aging more slowly.

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
It takes this worm two days

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day.

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And when I tell people about this,

74
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
they tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old person

75
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
who looks really good for being 90 or 80.

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But it's really more like this:

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
let's say you're a 30 year-old guy -- or in your 30s --

78
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and you're a bachelor and you're dating people.

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And you meet someone you really like, you get to know her.

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And you're in a restaurant, and you say, "Well how old are you?"

81
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
She says, "I'm 60."

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
That's what it's like. And you would never know.

83
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
You would never know, until she told you.

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Laughter)

85
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Okay.

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So what is the daf-2 gene?

87
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Well as you know, genes, which are part of the DNA,

88
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
they're instructions to make a protein that does something.

89
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And the daf-2 gene

90
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
encodes a hormone receptor.

91
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So what you see in the picture there

92
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
is a cell with a hormone receptor in red

93
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
punching through the edge of the cell.

94
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
So part of it is like a baseball glove.

95
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Part of it's on the outside,

96
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and it's catching the hormone as it comes by in green.

97
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And the other part is on the inside

98
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
where it sends signals into the cell.

99
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Okay, so what is the daf-2 receptor

100
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
telling the inside of the cell?

101
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I just told you that, if you make a mutation in the daf-2 gene cell,

102
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that you get a receptor that doesn't work as well;

103
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the animal lives longer.

104
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor

105
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
is to speed up aging.

106
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
That's what that arrow means.

107
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It speeds up aging. It makes it go faster.

108
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So it's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself,

109
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
speeding up aging.

110
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So this is altogether really, really interesting.

111
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
It says that aging is subject to control by the genes,

112
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and specifically by hormones.

113
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So what kind of hormones are these?

114
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
There's lots of hormones. There's testosterone, adrenalin.

115
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
You know about a lot of them.

116
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
These hormones are similar

117
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to hormones that we have in our bodies.

118
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The daf-2 hormone receptor

119
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
is very similar to the receptor

120
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
for the hormone insulin and IGF-1.

121
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Now you've all heard of at least insulin.

122
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients

123
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
into your tissues after you eat a meal.

124
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth.

125
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So these functions were known for these hormones for a long time,

126
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
but our studies suggested

127
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about --

128
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
maybe they also affect aging.

129
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And it's looking like that's the case.

130
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So after we made our discoveries with little C. elegans,

131
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
people who worked on other kinds of animals

132
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
started asking, if we made the same daf-2 mutation,

133
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
the hormone receptor mutation, in other animals,

134
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
will they live longer?

135
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And that is the case in flies.

136
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
If you change this hormone pathway in flies, they live longer.

137
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And also in mice -- and mice are mammals like us.

138
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So it's an ancient pathway,

139
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution

140
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
such that it still works in all these animals.

141
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And also, the common precursor also gave rise to people.

142
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So maybe it's working in people the same way.

143
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And there are hints of this.

144
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So for example, there was one study that was done

145
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
in a population of Ashkenazi Jews in New York City.

146
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And just like any population,

147
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
most of the people live to be about 70 or 80,

148
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
but some live to be 90 or 100.

149
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And what they found

150
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
was that people who lived to 90 or 100

151
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
were more likely to have daf-2 mutations --

152
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that is, changes in the gene

153
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that encodes the receptor for IGF-1.

154
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And these changes made the gene not act as well

155
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
as the normal gene would have acted.

156
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It damaged the gene.

157
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So those are hints

158
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
suggesting that humans are susceptible

159
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to the effects of the hormones for aging.

160
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So the next question, of course, is:

161
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Is there any effect on age-related disease?

162
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
As you age, you're much more likely

163
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
to get cancer, Alzheimer's disease,

164
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
heart disease, all sorts of diseases.

165
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
It turns out that these long-lived mutants

166
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
are more resistant to all these diseases.

167
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
They hardly get cancer,

168
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and when they do it's not as severe.

169
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So it's really interesting, and it makes sense in a way,

170
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that they're still young,

171
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old?

172
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So it suggests

173
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that, if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take

174
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to replicate some of these effects in humans,

175
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
maybe we would have a way

176
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
of combating lots of different age-related diseases

177
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
all at once.

178
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging?

179
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
How could that work?

180
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Well it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants,

181
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
a whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA

182
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues,

183
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and repair damage.

184
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And the way that they're switched on

185
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
is by a gene regulator protein called FOXO.

186
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So in a daf-2 mutant --

187
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor.

188
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The receptor isn't working as well.

189
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Under those conditions, the FOXO protein in blue

190
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
has gone into the nucleus --

191
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that little compartment there in the middle of the cell --

192
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and it's sitting down on a gene binding to it.

193
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
You see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO.

194
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And it's just sitting on one of them.

195
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So FOXO turns on a lot of genes.

196
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes,

197
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
genes I call carrot-giver genes,

198
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
whose protein products

199
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
actually help other proteins to function well --

200
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
to fold correctly and function correctly.

201
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell

202
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and recycle them if they're damaged.

203
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
DNA repair genes

204
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
are more active in these animals.

205
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And the immune system is more active.

206
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And many of these different genes, we've shown,

207
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant.

208
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So it's really interesting.

209
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
These animals have within them

210
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do.

211
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
They have the ability

212
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
to protect themselves from many kinds of damage,

213
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
which we think makes them live longer.

214
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So what about the normal worm?

215
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Well when the daf-2 receptor is active,

216
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
then it triggers a series of events

217
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
that prevent FOXO

218
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
from getting into the nucleus where the DNA is.

219
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So it can't turn the genes on.

220
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
That's how it works. That's why we don't see the long lifespan,

221
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
until we have the daf-2 mutant.

222
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
But what good is this for the worm?

223
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
Well we think that insulin and IGF-1 hormones

224
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
are hormones that are particularly active

225
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
under favorable conditions -- in the good times --

226
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
when food is plentiful and there's not a lot of stress in the environment.

227
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Then they promote the uptake of nutrients.

228
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
You can store the food, use it for energy,

229
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
grow, etc.

230
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
But what we think is that, under conditions of stress,

231
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
the levels of these hormones drop --

232
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
for example, having limited food supply.

233
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And that, we think,

234
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
is registered by the animal as a danger signal,

235
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
a signal that things are not okay

236
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and that it should roll out its protective capacity.

237
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So it activates FOXO, FOXO goes to the DNA,

238
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and that triggers the expression of these genes

239
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
that improves the ability of the cell

240
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to protect itself and repair itself.

241
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And that's why we think the animals live longer.

242
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So you can think of FOXO

243
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
as being like a building superintendent.

244
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So maybe he's a little bit lazy,

245
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
but he's there, he's taking care of the building.

246
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
But it's deteriorating.

247
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And then suddenly, he learns that there's going to be a hurricane.

248
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So he doesn't actually do anything himself.

249
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
He gets on the telephone --

250
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
just like FOXO gets on the DNA --

251
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and he calls up

252
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
the roofer, the window person,

253
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
the painter, the floor person.

254
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And they all come and they fortify the house.

255
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And then the hurricane comes through,

256
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in.

257
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And not only that, it can also just last longer,

258
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
even if there isn't a hurricane.

259
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So that's the concept here

260
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
for how we think this life extension ability exists.

261
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Now the really cool thing about FOXO

262
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
is that there are different forms of it.

263
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We all have FOXO genes,

264
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
but we don't all have exactly the same form of the FOXO gene.

265
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Just like we all have eyes,

266
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes.

267
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And there are certain forms of the FOXO gene

268
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that have found to be more frequently present

269
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
in people who live to be 90 or 100.

270
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And that's the case all over the world,

271
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
as you can see from these stars.

272
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And each one of these stars represents a population

273
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
where scientists have asked,

274
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
"Okay, are there differences in the type of FOXO genes

275
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
among people who live a really long time?" and there are.

276
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We don't know the details of how this works,

277
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
but we do know then

278
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
that FOXO genes can impact

279
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
the lifespan of people.

280
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And that means that, maybe if we tweak it a little bit,

281
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
we can increase the health and longevity of people.

282
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
So this is really exciting to me.

283
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
A FOXO is a protein that we found in these little, round worms

284
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
to affect lifespan,

285
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and here it affects lifespan in people.

286
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So we've been trying in our lab now

287
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
to develop drugs

288
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
that will activate this FOXO cell

289
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
using human cells now

290
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
in order to try and come up with drugs

291
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
that will delay aging and age-related diseases.

292
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And I'm really optimistic that this is going to work.

293
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
There are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging.

294
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And for at least one of them, there is a drug.

295
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
There's one called TOR, which is another nutrient sensor,

296
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
like the insulin pathway.

297
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And mutations that damage the TOR gene --

298
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
just like the daf-2 mutations --

299
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
extend lifespan in worms

300
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and flies and mice.

301
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
But in this case, there's already a drug called rapamycin

302
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that binds to the TOR protein

303
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and inhibits its activity.

304
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse --

305
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
even when it's pretty old, like age 60 for a human,

306
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
that old for a mouse --

307
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
if you give the mouse rapamycin,

308
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
it will live longer.

309
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Now I don't want you all to go out taking rapamycin.

310
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
It is a drug for people,

311
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
but the reason is it suppresses the immune system.

312
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected.

313
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
So this may not be the perfect drug

314
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
for staying young longer.

315
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
But still, here in the year 2011,

316
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
there's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age

317
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
that will extend their lifespan,

318
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
which comes out of this science

319
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
that's been done in all these different animals.

320
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
So I'm really optimistic,

321
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and I think it won't be too long, I hope,

322
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
before this age-old dream begins to come true.

323
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Thank you.

324
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
(Applause)

325
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Matt Ridley: Thank you, Cynthia.

326
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Let me get this straight.

327
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Although you're looking for a drug

328
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
that can solve aging

329
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
in old men like me,

330
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
what you could do now pretty well in the lab,

331
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
if you were allowed ethically,

332
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
is start a human life from scratch

333
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer?

334
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
CK: Ah, so the kinds of drugs I was talking about

335
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
would not change the genes,

336
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
they would just bind to the protein itself

337
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and change its activity.

338
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
So if you stop taking the drug, the protein would go back to normal.

339
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
You could change the genes in principle.

340
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
There isn't the technology to do that.

341
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
But I don't think that's a good idea.

342
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And the reason is

343
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that these hormones,

344
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
like the insulin and the IGF hormones and the TOR pathway,

345
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
they're essential.

346
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
If you knock them out completely, then you're very sick.

347
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
So it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully

348
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
to get the benefits without getting any problems.

349
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And I think that's much better,

350
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
that kind of control would be much better as a drug.

351
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And also, there are other ways of activating FOXO

352
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
that don't even involve insulin or IGF-1

353
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
that might even be safer.

354
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
MR: I wasn't suggesting that I was going to go and do it, but ...

355
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
(Laughter)

356
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
There's a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about,

357
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
which is a negligible senescence.

358
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
There are some creatures on this planet already

359
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that don't really do aging.

360
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Just move to one side for us, if you would.

361
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
CK: There are. There are some animals that don't seem to age.

362
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
For example, there are some tortoises called Blanding's turtles.

363
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And they grow to be about this size.

364
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And they've been tagged, and they've been found to be 70 years old.

365
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And when you look at these 70 year-old turtles,

366
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
you can't tell the difference, just by looking,

367
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
between those turtles and 20 year-old turtles.

368
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
And the 70 year-old ones,

369
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
actually they're better at scouting out the good nesting places,

370
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and they also have more progeny every year.

371
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And there are other examples of these kinds of animals,

372
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
like turns, certain kinds of birds are like this.

373
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And nobody knows if they really can live forever,

374
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
or what keeps them from aging.

375
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
It's not clear.

376
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
If you look at birds, which live a long time,

377
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
cells from the birds tend to be more resistant

378
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
to a lot of different environmental stresses

379
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
like high temperature

380
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
or hydrogen peroxide, things like that.

381
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And our long-lived mutants are too.

382
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
They're more resistant to these kinds of stresses.

383
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
So it could be that the pathways that I've been talking about,

384
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
which are set to run really quickly in the worm,

385
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
have a different normal set point

386
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
in something like a bird, so that a bird can live a lot longer.

387
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
And maybe they're even set really differently

388
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
in animals with no senescence at all -- but we don't know.

389
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
MR: But what you're talking about here

390
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
is not extending human lifespan

391
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
by preventing death,

392
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
so much as extending human youthspan.

393
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
CK: Yes, that's right.

394
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
It's more like, say, if you were a dog.

395
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
You notice that you're getting old, and you look at your human

396
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and you think, "Why isn't this human getting old?"

397
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
They're not getting old in the dog's lifespan.

398
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
It's more like that.

399
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
But now we're the human looking out and imagining a different human.

400
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
MR: Thank you very much indeed, Cynthia Kenyon.

401
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
(Applause)

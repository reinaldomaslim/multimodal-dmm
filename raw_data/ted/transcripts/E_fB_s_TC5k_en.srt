2
0:00:12.734,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm a relationship builder.

3
0:00:14.964,000 --> 0:00:15,000
When you think of a relationship builder,

4
0:00:16.96,000 --> 0:00:18,000
don't you just automatically think "architect?"

5
0:00:19.742,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Probably not.

6
0:00:21.897,000 --> 0:00:25,000
That's because most people think architects design buildings and cities,

7
0:00:26.127,000 --> 0:00:28,000
but what we really design are relationships,

8
0:00:29.203,000 --> 0:00:31,000
because cities are about people.

9
0:00:31.334,000 --> 0:00:34,000
They're places where people come together for all kinds of exchange.

10
0:00:34.74,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And besides, skylines are highly specific urban habitats

11
0:00:37.981,000 --> 0:00:39,000
with their own insects, plants and animals,

12
0:00:40.323,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and even their own weather.

13
0:00:42.47,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But today, urban habitats are out of balance.

14
0:00:45.623,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Climate change, together with political and economic troubles,

15
0:00:49.679,000 --> 0:00:5,000
are having an impact;

16
0:00:50.855,000 --> 0:00:53,000
they're adding up and stressing out cities and us,

17
0:00:54.191,000 --> 0:00:55,000
the people who live in them.

18
0:00:56.82,000 --> 0:00:59,000
For me, the field of ecology has provided important insight,

19
0:01:00.469,000 --> 0:01:04,000
because ecologists don't just look at individual species on their own,

20
0:01:04.702,000 --> 0:01:07,000
they look at the relationships between living things

21
0:01:07.919,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and their environment.

22
0:01:10.374,000 --> 0:01:13,000
They look at how all the diverse parts of the ecosystem are interconnected,

23
0:01:14.276,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and it's actually this balance, this web of life, that sustains life.

24
0:01:19.088,000 --> 0:01:23,000
My team and I have been applying insights from ecology to architecture

25
0:01:23.704,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to see how physical space can help build stronger relationships.

26
0:01:28.124,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The projects I'm going to show you today

27
0:01:30.11,000 --> 0:01:33,000
use the idea of building relationships as the key driver for design.

28
0:01:34.672,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Here's an example of what I mean.

29
0:01:36.529,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Recently, we were asked to design a center for social justice leadership

30
0:01:40.702,000 --> 0:01:41,000
called the Arcus Center.

31
0:01:42.922,000 --> 0:01:45,000
They asked us for a building that could break down traditional barriers

32
0:01:46.468,000 --> 0:01:47,000
between different groups

33
0:01:47.776,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and in doing so, create possibilities for meaningful conversations

34
0:01:52.047,000 --> 0:01:53,000
around social justice.

35
0:01:54.053,000 --> 0:01:56,000
The students wanted a place for cultural exchange.

36
0:01:56.734,000 --> 0:01:59,000
They thought a place for preparing food together could do that.

37
0:02:00.557,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And they wanted to be welcoming to the outside community.

38
0:02:03.312,000 --> 0:02:05,000
They thought a fireplace could draw people in

39
0:02:05.999,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and help start conversations.

40
0:02:09.373,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And everybody wanted the work of social justice to be visible

41
0:02:12.862,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to the outside world.

42
0:02:15.388,000 --> 0:02:17,000
There really wasn't a precedent for this kind of space,

43
0:02:18.153,000 --> 0:02:2,000
so we looked around the globe and found examples

44
0:02:20.644,000 --> 0:02:21,000
of community meeting houses.

45
0:02:22.794,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Community meeting houses are places

46
0:02:25.008,000 --> 0:02:28,000
where there's very specific relationships between people,

47
0:02:28.393,000 --> 0:02:31,000
like this one in Mali, where the elders gather.

48
0:02:32.009,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The low roof keeps everybody seated and at equal eye level.

49
0:02:35.585,000 --> 0:02:36,000
It's very egalitarian.

50
0:02:36.832,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I mean, you can't stand up and take over the meeting.

51
0:02:39.334,000 --> 0:02:4,000
You'd actually bump your head.

52
0:02:40.871,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:42.548,000 --> 0:02:44,000
In meeting houses, there's always a central space

54
0:02:45.186,000 --> 0:02:47,000
where you can sit around a circle and see each other.

55
0:02:47.861,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So we designed a space just like that

56
0:02:49.906,000 --> 0:02:5,000
right in the middle of the Arcus Center,

57
0:02:51.909,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and we anchored it with a fireplace and a kitchen.

58
0:02:54.923,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It's pretty hard to get a kitchen and a fireplace in a building like this

59
0:02:58.419,000 --> 0:02:59,000
with the building codes,

60
0:02:59.647,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but it was so important to the concept, we got it done.

61
0:03:03.108,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And now the central space works for big social gatherings

62
0:03:06.913,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and a place to meet one-on-one for the very first time.

63
0:03:10.175,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It's almost like this three-way intersection

64
0:03:12.278,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that encourages bumping into people and starting a conversation.

65
0:03:16.496,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Now you can always pass the kitchen and see something going on.

66
0:03:19.664,000 --> 0:03:22,000
You can sit by the fireplace and share stories.

67
0:03:23.574,000 --> 0:03:26,000
You can study together in big groups or in small ones,

68
0:03:26.795,000 --> 0:03:29,000
because the architecture sets up these opportunities.

69
0:03:31.461,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Even the construction is about building relationships.

70
0:03:34.088,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It's made of cordwood masonry,

71
0:03:35.973,000 --> 0:03:37,000
which is using logs the way you would use bricks.

72
0:03:38.934,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It's super low-tech and easy to do and anyone can do it --

73
0:03:41.929,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and that's the entire point.

74
0:03:43.63,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The act of making is a social activity.

75
0:03:48.232,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And it's good for the planet, too:

76
0:03:50.264,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the trees absorbed carbon when they were growing up,

77
0:03:53.384,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and they gave off oxygen,

78
0:03:55.052,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and now that carbon is trapped inside the walls

79
0:03:57.817,000 --> 0:04:,000
and it's not being released into the atmosphere.

80
0:04:01.014,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So making the walls is equivalent to taking cars right off the road.

81
0:04:05.969,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We chose the building method

82
0:04:08.262,000 --> 0:04:11,000
because it connects people to each other and to the environment.

83
0:04:13.255,000 --> 0:04:14,000
But is it working?

84
0:04:14.43,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Is it creating relationships and nurturing them?

85
0:04:16.72,000 --> 0:04:17,000
How can we know?

86
0:04:18.062,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Well, more and more people are coming here, for one,

87
0:04:21.497,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and as a result of the fireside chats

88
0:04:23.841,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and a full calendar of programming,

89
0:04:25.963,000 --> 0:04:27,000
people are applying for the Arcus Fellowships.

90
0:04:28.575,000 --> 0:04:32,000
In fact, applications have increased tenfold for the Arcus Fellowship

91
0:04:32.898,000 --> 0:04:33,000
since the building opened.

92
0:04:34.187,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It's working. It's bringing people together.

93
0:04:38.074,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So I've shown how architecture can connect people

94
0:04:40.466,000 --> 0:04:42,000
on this kind of horizontal campus scale.

95
0:04:43.165,000 --> 0:04:46,000
But we wondered if social relationships could be scaled up --

96
0:04:46.687,000 --> 0:04:48,000
or rather, upward -- in tall buildings.

97
0:04:50.201,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Tall buildings don't necessarily lend themselves to being social buildings.

98
0:04:54.262,000 --> 0:04:55,000
They can seem isolating and inward.

99
0:04:56.646,000 --> 0:05:,000
You might only see people in those awkward elevator rides.

100
0:05:02.496,000 --> 0:05:05,000
But in several major cities, I've been designing tall buildings

101
0:05:06.031,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that are based on creating relationships between people.

102
0:05:09.396,000 --> 0:05:1,000
This is Aqua.

103
0:05:10.896,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It's a residential high-rise in Chicago

104
0:05:14.494,000 --> 0:05:16,000
aimed at young urban professionals and empty nesters,

105
0:05:17.129,000 --> 0:05:18,000
many of them new to the city.

106
0:05:19.637,000 --> 0:05:22,000
With over 700 apartments, we wanted to see if we could use architecture

107
0:05:23.587,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to help people get to know their neighbors,

108
0:05:25.682,000 --> 0:05:28,000
even when their homes are organized in the vertical dimension.

109
0:05:30.908,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So we invented a way to use balconies as the new social connectors.

110
0:05:35.389,000 --> 0:05:38,000
The shapes of the floor slabs vary slightly and they transition

111
0:05:38.953,000 --> 0:05:39,000
as you go up the tower.

112
0:05:40.346,000 --> 0:05:43,000
The result of this is that you can actually see people

113
0:05:44.271,000 --> 0:05:45,000
from your balcony.

114
0:05:45.64,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The balconies are misregistered.

115
0:05:47.797,000 --> 0:05:49,000
You can lean over your balcony and say, "Hey!"

116
0:05:49.965,000 --> 0:05:51,000
just like you would across the backyard.

117
0:05:52.967,000 --> 0:05:53,000
To make the balconies more comfortable

118
0:05:54.87,000 --> 0:05:56,000
for a longer period of time during the year,

119
0:05:57.171,000 --> 0:05:59,000
we studied the wind with digital simulations,

120
0:05:59.661,000 --> 0:06:01,000
so the effect of the balcony shapes breaks up the wind

121
0:06:02.547,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and confuses the wind

122
0:06:03.882,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and makes the balconies more comfortable and less windy.

123
0:06:07.93,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Now, just by being able to go outside on your balcony

124
0:06:10.903,000 --> 0:06:12,000
or on the third floor roof terrace,

125
0:06:13.002,000 --> 0:06:15,000
you can be connected to the outdoors,

126
0:06:15.111,000 --> 0:06:17,000
even when you're way above the ground plane.

127
0:06:17.266,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So the building acts to create community

128
0:06:20.025,000 --> 0:06:22,000
within the building and the city at the same time.

129
0:06:22.67,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It's working.

130
0:06:24.683,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And people are starting to meet each other on the building surface

131
0:06:28.707,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and we've heard --

132
0:06:29.887,000 --> 0:06:3,000
(Laughter)

133
0:06:30.967,000 --> 0:06:32,000
they've even starting getting together as couples.

134
0:06:34.576,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But besides romantic relationships,

135
0:06:37.227,000 --> 0:06:39,000
the building has a positive social effect

136
0:06:39.491,000 --> 0:06:4,000
on the community,

137
0:06:41.452,000 --> 0:06:43,000
as evidenced by people starting groups together

138
0:06:44.163,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and starting big projects together,

139
0:06:46.033,000 --> 0:06:49,000
like this organic community garden on the building's roof terrace.

140
0:06:51.694,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So I've shown how tall buildings can be social connectors,

141
0:06:54.734,000 --> 0:06:55,000
but what about public architecture?

142
0:06:56.75,000 --> 0:06:59,000
How can we create better social cohesion in public buildings

143
0:07:00.637,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and civic spaces,

144
0:07:02.018,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and why is it important?

145
0:07:03.89,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Public architecture is just not as successful

146
0:07:06.011,000 --> 0:07:07,000
if it comes from the top down.

147
0:07:09.313,000 --> 0:07:11,000
About 15 years ago in Chicago,

148
0:07:11.435,000 --> 0:07:14,000
they started to replace old police stations,

149
0:07:14.566,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and they built this identical model all over the city.

150
0:07:18.319,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And even though they had good intentions

151
0:07:20.904,000 --> 0:07:22,000
of treating all neighborhoods equally,

152
0:07:23.426,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the communities didn't feel invested in the process

153
0:07:25.87,000 --> 0:07:27,000
or feel a sense of ownership of these buildings.

154
0:07:28.408,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It was equality in the sense that everybody gets the same police station,

155
0:07:31.959,000 --> 0:07:34,000
but it wasn't equity in the sense of responding

156
0:07:35.337,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to each community's individual needs.

157
0:07:37.719,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And equity is the key issue here.

158
0:07:40.584,000 --> 0:07:43,000
You know, in my field, there's a debate

159
0:07:44.008,000 --> 0:07:46,000
about whether architecture can even do anything

160
0:07:46.623,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to improve social relationships.

161
0:07:48.832,000 --> 0:07:53,000
But I believe that we need architecture and every tool in our tool kit

162
0:07:54.29,000 --> 0:07:55,000
to improve these relationships.

163
0:07:57.133,000 --> 0:08:,000
In the US, policy reforms have been recommended

164
0:08:00.54,000 --> 0:08:01,000
in order to rebuild trust.

165
0:08:02.368,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But my team and I wondered

166
0:08:03.8,000 --> 0:08:06,000
if design and a more inclusive design process

167
0:08:06.863,000 --> 0:08:09,000
could help add something positive to this policy conversation.

168
0:08:10.54,000 --> 0:08:11,000
We asked ourselves simply:

169
0:08:12.25,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Can design help rebuild trust?

170
0:08:14.928,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So we reached out to community members and police officers in North Lawndale;

171
0:08:19.274,000 --> 0:08:2,000
it's a neighborhood in Chicago

172
0:08:20.857,000 --> 0:08:22,000
where the police station is perceived as a scary fortress

173
0:08:23.697,000 --> 0:08:24,000
surrounded by a parking lot.

174
0:08:26.074,000 --> 0:08:28,000
In North Lawndale, people are afraid of police

175
0:08:28.716,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and of going anywhere near the police station,

176
0:08:30.945,000 --> 0:08:31,000
even to report a crime.

177
0:08:32.663,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So we organized this brainstorming session

178
0:08:35.44,000 --> 0:08:36,000
with both groups participating,

179
0:08:37.122,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and we came up with this whole new idea for the police station.

180
0:08:40.961,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It's called "Polis Station."

181
0:08:42.89,000 --> 0:08:46,000
"Polis" is a Greek word that means a place with a sense of community.

182
0:08:48.348,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It's based on the idea

183
0:08:49.992,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that if you can increase opportunities for positive social interactions

184
0:08:53.953,000 --> 0:08:55,000
between police and community members,

185
0:08:56.27,000 --> 0:08:58,000
you can rebuild that relationship

186
0:08:58.489,000 --> 0:09:,000
and activate the neighborhood at the same time.

187
0:09:02.003,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Instead of the police station as a scary fortress,

188
0:09:05.132,000 --> 0:09:09,000
you get highly active spaces on the public side of the station --

189
0:09:09.613,000 --> 0:09:1,000
places that spark conversation,

190
0:09:11.147,000 --> 0:09:13,000
like a barbershop, a coffee shop

191
0:09:13.731,000 --> 0:09:14,000
or sports courts as well.

192
0:09:15.328,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Both cops and kids said they love sports.

193
0:09:18.159,000 --> 0:09:21,000
These insights came directly from the community members

194
0:09:21.574,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and the police officers themselves,

195
0:09:23.93,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and as designers, our role was just to connect the dots

196
0:09:27.713,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and suggest the first step.

197
0:09:29.673,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So with the help of the city and the parks,

198
0:09:32.311,000 --> 0:09:36,000
we were able to raise funds and design and build a half-court,

199
0:09:36.621,000 --> 0:09:38,000
right on the police station parking lot.

200
0:09:38.985,000 --> 0:09:39,000
It's a start.

201
0:09:40.45,000 --> 0:09:41,000
But is it rebuilding trust?

202
0:09:42.674,000 --> 0:09:45,000
The people in North Lawndale say the kids are using the courts every day

203
0:09:46.274,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and they even organize tournaments like this one shown here,

204
0:09:49.647,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and once in a while an officer joins in.

205
0:09:54.084,000 --> 0:09:56,000
But now, they even have basketballs inside the station

206
0:09:56.774,000 --> 0:09:57,000
that kids can borrow.

207
0:09:58.063,000 --> 0:10:,000
And recently they've asked us to expand the courts

208
0:10:00.579,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and build a park on the site.

209
0:10:04.459,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And parents report something astonishing.

210
0:10:07.311,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Before, there was fear of going anywhere the station, and now they say

211
0:10:11.566,000 --> 0:10:14,000
there's a sense that the court is safer than other courts nearby,

212
0:10:15.077,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and they prefer their kids to play here.

213
0:10:18.097,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So maybe in the future,

214
0:10:19.711,000 --> 0:10:2,000
on the public side of the station,

215
0:10:21.381,000 --> 0:10:24,000
you might be able to drop in for a haircut at the barbershop

216
0:10:25.11,000 --> 0:10:27,000
or reserve the community room for a birthday party

217
0:10:27.783,000 --> 0:10:28,000
or renew your driver's license

218
0:10:29.45,000 --> 0:10:31,000
or get money out of an ATM.

219
0:10:32.024,000 --> 0:10:34,000
It can be a place for neighbors to meet each other

220
0:10:34.739,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and to get to know the officers, and vice versa.

221
0:10:38.601,000 --> 0:10:39,000
This is not a utopian fantasy.

222
0:10:40.569,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It's about how do you design to rebuild trust,

223
0:10:44.581,000 --> 0:10:45,000
trusting relationships?

224
0:10:46.829,000 --> 0:10:49,000
You know, every city has parks, libraries, schools

225
0:10:50.644,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and other public buildings

226
0:10:52.062,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that have the potential to be reimagined as social connectors.

227
0:10:56.954,000 --> 0:11:,000
But reimagining the buildings for the future is going to require

228
0:11:01.008,000 --> 0:11:03,000
engaging the people who live there.

229
0:11:03.799,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Engaging the public can be intimidating, and I've felt that, too.

230
0:11:07.711,000 --> 0:11:09,000
But maybe that's because in architecture school,

231
0:11:10.016,000 --> 0:11:14,000
we don't really learn how to engage the public in the act of design.

232
0:11:14.047,000 --> 0:11:17,000
We're taught to defend our design against criticism.

233
0:11:17.594,000 --> 0:11:19,000
But I think that can change, too.

234
0:11:20.813,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So if we can focus the design mind

235
0:11:23.41,000 --> 0:11:26,000
on creating positive, reinforcing relationships

236
0:11:27.414,000 --> 0:11:28,000
in architecture and through architecture,

237
0:11:29.418,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I believe we can do much more than create individual buildings.

238
0:11:34.065,000 --> 0:11:37,000
We can reduce the stress and the polarization

239
0:11:37.284,000 --> 0:11:38,000
in our urban habitats.

240
0:11:40.1,000 --> 0:11:41,000
We can create relationships.

241
0:11:41.989,000 --> 0:11:43,000
We can help steady this planet we all share.

242
0:11:45.962,000 --> 0:11:46,000
See?

243
0:11:47.145,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Architects really are relationship builders.

244
0:11:49.408,000 --> 0:11:5,000
(Laughter)

245
0:11:50.794,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Thank you very much.

246
0:11:51.97,000 --> 0:11:53,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.089,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Oliver was an extremely dashing,

2
0:00:17.153,000 --> 0:00:21,000
handsome, charming and largely unstable male

3
0:00:21.974,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that I completely lost my heart to.

4
0:00:25.159,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:28.08,000 --> 0:00:29,000
He was a Bernese mountain dog,

6
0:00:29.746,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and my ex-husband and I adopted him,

7
0:00:32.929,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and about six months in,

8
0:00:34.618,000 --> 0:00:36,000
we realized that he was a mess.

9
0:00:37.182,000 --> 0:00:39,000
He had such paralyzing separation anxiety

10
0:00:39.962,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that we couldn't leave him alone.

11
0:00:41.498,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Once, he jumped out of our third floor apartment.

12
0:00:44.626,000 --> 0:00:48,000
He ate fabric. He ate things, recyclables.

13
0:00:49.047,000 --> 0:00:5,000
He hunted flies that didn't exist.

14
0:00:50.952,000 --> 0:00:51,000
He suffered from hallucinations.

15
0:00:52.681,000 --> 0:00:55,000
He was diagnosed with a canine compulsive disorder

16
0:00:55.985,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and that's really just the tip of the iceberg.

17
0:00:59.331,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But like with humans,

18
0:01:03.432,000 --> 0:01:06,000
sometimes it's six months in

19
0:01:06.543,000 --> 0:01:08,000
before you realize that

20
0:01:08.58,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the person that you love has some issues.

21
0:01:11.527,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:12.938,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And most of us do not take the person we're dating

23
0:01:16.872,000 --> 0:01:18,000
back to the bar where we met them

24
0:01:19.008,000 --> 0:01:23,000
or give them back to the friend that introduced us,

25
0:01:23.344,000 --> 0:01:25,000
or sign them back up on Match.com.

26
0:01:26.098,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:28.928,000 --> 0:01:29,000
We love them anyway,

28
0:01:30.727,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and we stick to it,

29
0:01:32.723,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and that is what I did with my dog.

30
0:01:36.955,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And I was a — I'd studied biology.

31
0:01:40.757,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I have a Ph.D. in history of science

32
0:01:43.377,000 --> 0:01:44,000
from MIT,

33
0:01:44.882,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and had you asked me 10 years ago

34
0:01:46.58,000 --> 0:01:48,000
if a dog I loved, or just dogs generally,

35
0:01:48.989,000 --> 0:01:49,000
had emotions, I would have said yes,

36
0:01:50.825,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but I'm not sure that I would have told you

37
0:01:52.289,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that they can also wind up with an anxiety disorder,

38
0:01:54.587,000 --> 0:01:58,000
a Prozac prescription and a therapist.

39
0:01:58.678,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But then, I fell in love, and I realized that they can,

40
0:02:02.624,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and actually trying to help my own dog

41
0:02:05.25,000 --> 0:02:07,000
overcome his panic and his anxiety,

42
0:02:07.864,000 --> 0:02:09,000
it just changed my life.

43
0:02:10.227,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It cracked open my world.

44
0:02:12.764,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And I spent the last seven years, actually,

45
0:02:15.131,000 --> 0:02:17,000
looking into this topic of mental illness in other animals.

46
0:02:17.73,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Can they be mentally ill like people,

47
0:02:19.075,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and if so, what does it mean about us?

48
0:02:22.08,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And what I discovered is that I do believe

49
0:02:24.879,000 --> 0:02:25,000
they can suffer from mental illness,

50
0:02:26.819,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and actually looking and trying to identify mental illness in them

51
0:02:31.295,000 --> 0:02:33,000
often helps us be better friends to them

52
0:02:33.377,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and also can help us better understand ourselves.

53
0:02:37.431,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So let's talk about diagnosis for a minute.

54
0:02:40.877,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Many of us think that we can't know

55
0:02:43.558,000 --> 0:02:45,000
what another animal is thinking,

56
0:02:46.021,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and that is true,

57
0:02:47.299,000 --> 0:02:49,000
but any of you in relationships —

58
0:02:49.891,000 --> 0:02:5,000
at least this is my case —

59
0:02:51.747,000 --> 0:02:52,000
just because you ask someone that you're with

60
0:02:53.547,000 --> 0:02:55,000
or your parent or your child how they feel

61
0:02:55.741,000 --> 0:02:56,000
doesn't mean that they can tell you.

62
0:02:57.551,000 --> 0:02:59,000
They may not have words to explain

63
0:02:59.869,000 --> 0:03:,000
what it is that they're feeling,

64
0:03:00.932,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and they may not know.

65
0:03:02.775,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It's actually a pretty recent phenomenon

66
0:03:04.64,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that we feel that we have to talk to someone

67
0:03:06.386,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to understand their emotional distress.

68
0:03:08.79,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Before the early 20th century,

69
0:03:11.217,000 --> 0:03:13,000
physicians often diagnosed emotional distress

70
0:03:13.737,000 --> 0:03:16,000
in their patients just by observation.

71
0:03:17.235,000 --> 0:03:18,000
It also turns out that thinking about

72
0:03:18.918,000 --> 0:03:19,000
mental illness in other animals

73
0:03:20.513,000 --> 0:03:22,000
isn't actually that much of a stretch.

74
0:03:22.706,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Most mental disorders in the United States

75
0:03:24.619,000 --> 0:03:26,000
are fear and anxiety disorders,

76
0:03:27.339,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and when you think about it, fear and anxiety

77
0:03:29.308,000 --> 0:03:33,000
are actually really extremely helpful animal emotions.

78
0:03:33.5,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Usually we feel fear and anxiety in situations that are dangerous,

79
0:03:36.6,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and once we feel them,

80
0:03:37.897,000 --> 0:03:38,000
we then are motivated to move away

81
0:03:39.526,000 --> 0:03:4,000
from whatever is dangerous.

82
0:03:41.357,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The problem is when we begin to feel fear and anxiety in situations that don't call for it.

83
0:03:46.326,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Mood disorders, too, may actually just be

84
0:03:49.536,000 --> 0:03:52,000
the unfortunate downside of being a feeling animal,

85
0:03:53.042,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and obsessive compulsive disorders also

86
0:03:56.207,000 --> 0:03:59,000
are often manifestations of a really healthy animal thing

87
0:03:59.616,000 --> 0:04:01,000
which is keeping yourself clean and groomed.

88
0:04:02.396,000 --> 0:04:04,000
This tips into the territory of mental illness

89
0:04:04.544,000 --> 0:04:05,000
when you do things like

90
0:04:05.69,000 --> 0:04:07,000
compulsively over-wash your hands or paws,

91
0:04:08.293,000 --> 0:04:1,000
or you develop a ritual that's so extreme

92
0:04:10.359,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that you can't sit down to a bowl of food

93
0:04:12.451,000 --> 0:04:14,000
unless you engage in that ritual.

94
0:04:15.443,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So for humans, we have the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual,"

95
0:04:19.774,000 --> 0:04:21,000
which is basically an atlas

96
0:04:21.901,000 --> 0:04:23,000
of the currently agreed-upon mental disorders.

97
0:04:24.634,000 --> 0:04:27,000
In other animals, we have YouTube.

98
0:04:27.885,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:29.491,000 --> 0:04:31,000
This is just one search I did for "OCD dog"

100
0:04:32.138,000 --> 0:04:33,000
but I encourage all of you

101
0:04:33.926,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to look at "OCD cat."

102
0:04:36.877,000 --> 0:04:39,000
You will be shocked by what you see.

103
0:04:40.271,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I'm going to show you just a couple examples.

104
0:04:44.77,000 --> 0:04:46,000
This is an example of shadow-chasing.

105
0:04:47.492,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I know, and it's funny and in some ways it's cute.

106
0:04:50.568,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The issue, though, is that dogs can develop compulsions like this

107
0:04:54.063,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that they then engage in all day.

108
0:04:56.965,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So they won't go for a walk,

109
0:04:58.237,000 --> 0:04:59,000
they won't hang out with their friends,

110
0:04:59.891,000 --> 0:05:,000
they won't eat.

111
0:05:01.477,000 --> 0:05:02,000
They'll develop fixations

112
0:05:03.01,000 --> 0:05:06,000
like chasing their tails compulsively.

113
0:05:06.127,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Here's an example of a cat named Gizmo.

114
0:05:09.528,000 --> 0:05:12,000
He looks like he's on a stakeout

115
0:05:12.74,000 --> 0:05:15,000
but he does this for many, many, many hours a day.

116
0:05:16.054,000 --> 0:05:19,000
He just sits there and he will paw and paw and paw

117
0:05:19.558,000 --> 0:05:2,000
at the screen.

118
0:05:21.092,000 --> 0:05:23,000
This is another example of what's considered

119
0:05:23.569,000 --> 0:05:24,000
a stereotypic behavior.

120
0:05:25.353,000 --> 0:05:27,000
This is a sun bear at the Oakland Zoo named Ting Ting.

121
0:05:28.06,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And if you just sort of happened upon this scene,

122
0:05:29.825,000 --> 0:05:29,000
you might think that Ting Ting

123
0:05:30.776,000 --> 0:05:31,000
is just playing with a stick,

124
0:05:32.49,000 --> 0:05:34,000
but Ting Ting does this all day,

125
0:05:34.536,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and if you pay close attention

126
0:05:36.132,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and if I showed you guys the full half-hour of this clip,

127
0:05:39.803,000 --> 0:05:41,000
you'd see that he does the exact same thing

128
0:05:41.829,000 --> 0:05:43,000
in the exact same order, and he spins the stick

129
0:05:43.978,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in the exact same way every time.

130
0:05:46.328,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Other super common behaviors that you may see,

131
0:05:48.82,000 --> 0:05:49,000
particularly in captive animals,

132
0:05:50.644,000 --> 0:05:54,000
are pacing stereotypies or swaying stereotypies,

133
0:05:55.204,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and actually, humans do this too,

134
0:05:56.88,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and in us, we'll sway,

135
0:05:58.624,000 --> 0:05:59,000
we'll move from side to side.

136
0:06:00.211,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Many of us do this, and sometimes

137
0:06:02.482,000 --> 0:06:03,000
it's an effort to soothe ourselves,

138
0:06:04.028,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and I think in other animals that is often the case too.

139
0:06:06.678,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But it's not just stereotypic behaviors

140
0:06:08.364,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that other animals engage in.

141
0:06:10.13,000 --> 0:06:12,000
This is Gigi. She's a gorilla that lives

142
0:06:12.258,000 --> 0:06:13,000
at the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston.

143
0:06:13.919,000 --> 0:06:15,000
She actually has a Harvard psychiatrist,

144
0:06:16.127,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and she's been treated for a mood disorder

145
0:06:17.849,000 --> 0:06:18,000
among other things.

146
0:06:19.432,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Many animals develop mood disorders.

147
0:06:22.427,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Lots of creatures —

148
0:06:23.855,000 --> 0:06:24,000
this horse is just one example —

149
0:06:25.39,000 --> 0:06:26,000
develop self-destructive behaviors.

150
0:06:27.072,000 --> 0:06:28,000
They'll gnaw on things

151
0:06:28.357,000 --> 0:06:3,000
or do other things that may also soothe them,

152
0:06:30.503,000 --> 0:06:31,000
even if they're self-destructive,

153
0:06:32.201,000 --> 0:06:33,000
which could be considered similar

154
0:06:33.508,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to the ways that some humans cut themselves.

155
0:06:37.249,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Plucking.

156
0:06:38.562,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Turns out, if you have fur or feathers or skin,

157
0:06:42.319,000 --> 0:06:43,000
you can pluck yourself compulsively,

158
0:06:44.294,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and some parrots actually have been studied

159
0:06:46.616,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to better understand trichotillomania, or compulsive plucking in humans,

160
0:06:49.714,000 --> 0:06:5,000
something that affects

161
0:06:51.161,000 --> 0:06:53,000
20 million Americans right now.

162
0:06:53.441,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Lab rats pluck themselves too.

163
0:06:55.509,000 --> 0:06:57,000
In them, it's called barbering.

164
0:06:57.742,000 --> 0:07:,000
Canine veterans of conflicts of Iraq and Afghanistan

165
0:07:00.819,000 --> 0:07:02,000
are coming back with what's considered canine PTSD,

166
0:07:03.8,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and they're having a hard time reentering civilian life

167
0:07:06.512,000 --> 0:07:07,000
when they come back from deployments.

168
0:07:07.797,000 --> 0:07:09,000
They can be too scared to approach men with beards

169
0:07:10.403,000 --> 0:07:12,000
or to hop into cars.

170
0:07:13.116,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I want to be careful and be clear, though.

171
0:07:15.882,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I do not think that canine PTSD

172
0:07:18.559,000 --> 0:07:2,000
is the same as human PTSD.

173
0:07:21.36,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But I also do not think that my PTSD

174
0:07:23.835,000 --> 0:07:24,000
is like your PTSD,

175
0:07:24.93,000 --> 0:07:27,000
or that my anxiety or that my sadness is like yours.

176
0:07:28.632,000 --> 0:07:29,000
We are all different.

177
0:07:30.337,000 --> 0:07:32,000
We also all have very different susceptibilities.

178
0:07:33.172,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So two dogs, raised in the same household,

179
0:07:36.913,000 --> 0:07:38,000
exposed to the very same things,

180
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
one may develop, say, a debilitating fear of motorcycles,

181
0:07:43.159,000 --> 0:07:45,000
or a phobia of the beep of the microwave,

182
0:07:45.907,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and another one is going to be just fine.

183
0:07:47.762,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So one thing that people ask me pretty frequently:

184
0:07:50.595,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Is this just an instance of humans

185
0:07:52.538,000 --> 0:07:53,000
driving other animals crazy?

186
0:07:54.167,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Or, is animal mental illness just a result of mistreatment or abuse?

187
0:07:58.09,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And it turns out we're actually

188
0:07:59.619,000 --> 0:08:02,000
so much more complicated than that.

189
0:08:03.174,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So one great thing that has happened to me

190
0:08:06.161,000 --> 0:08:09,000
is recently I published a book on this,

191
0:08:09.41,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and every day now that I open my email

192
0:08:13.355,000 --> 0:08:14,000
or when I go to a reading

193
0:08:14.809,000 --> 0:08:16,000
or even when I go to a cocktail party,

194
0:08:16.921,000 --> 0:08:17,000
people tell me their stories

195
0:08:18.822,000 --> 0:08:19,000
of the animals that they have met.

196
0:08:20.576,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And recently, I did a reading in California,

197
0:08:23.02,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and a woman raised her hand after the talk and she said,

198
0:08:25.45,000 --> 0:08:28,000
"Dr. Braitman, I think my cat has PTSD."

199
0:08:29.126,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And I said, "Well, why? Tell me a little bit about it."

200
0:08:32.49,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So, Ping is her cat. She was a rescue,

201
0:08:35.909,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and she used to live with an elderly man,

202
0:08:38.631,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and one day the man was vacuuming

203
0:08:40.902,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and he suffered a heart attack, and he died.

204
0:08:43.727,000 --> 0:08:45,000
A week later, Ping was discovered in the apartment

205
0:08:46.661,000 --> 0:08:47,000
alongside the body of her owner,

206
0:08:48.655,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and the vacuum had been running the entire time.

207
0:08:52.042,000 --> 0:08:57,000
For many months, up to I think two years after that incident,

208
0:08:57.35,000 --> 0:08:59,000
she was so scared she couldn't be in the house when anyone was cleaning.

209
0:08:59.96,000 --> 0:09:,000
She was quite literally a scaredy cat.

210
0:09:01.75,000 --> 0:09:03,000
She would hide in the closet.

211
0:09:04.19,000 --> 0:09:05,000
She was un-self-confident and shaky,

212
0:09:05.992,000 --> 0:09:07,000
but with the loving support of her family,

213
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
a lot of a time, and their patience,

214
0:09:10.726,000 --> 0:09:11,000
now, three years later,

215
0:09:11.98,000 --> 0:09:14,000
she's actually a happy, confident cat.

216
0:09:15.225,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Another story of trauma and recovery that I came across

217
0:09:18.18,000 --> 0:09:19,000
was actually a few years ago.

218
0:09:19.676,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I was in Thailand to do some research.

219
0:09:21.916,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I met a monkey named Boonlua,

220
0:09:25.01,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and when Boonlua was a baby,

221
0:09:27.282,000 --> 0:09:29,000
he was attacked by a pack of dogs,

222
0:09:29.296,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and they ripped off both of his legs and one arm,

223
0:09:34.14,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and Boonlua dragged himself to a monastery,

224
0:09:37.283,000 --> 0:09:38,000
where the monks took him in.

225
0:09:38.834,000 --> 0:09:4,000
They called in a veterinarian, who treated his wounds.

226
0:09:41.445,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Eventually, Boonlua wound up

227
0:09:43.66,000 --> 0:09:44,000
at an elephant facility,

228
0:09:45.453,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and the keepers really decided to take him under their wing,

229
0:09:48.422,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and they figured out what he liked,

230
0:09:49.785,000 --> 0:09:51,000
which, it turned out, was mint Mentos

231
0:09:51.804,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and Rhinoceros beetles and eggs.

232
0:09:55.281,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But they worried, because he was social, that he was lonely,

233
0:09:58.453,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and they didn't want to put him in with another monkey,

234
0:10:00.22,000 --> 0:10:01,000
because they thought with just one arm,

235
0:10:01.423,000 --> 0:10:03,000
he wouldn't be able to defend himself or even play.

236
0:10:04.218,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And so they gave him a rabbit,

237
0:10:06.704,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and Boonlua was immediately a different monkey.

238
0:10:09.517,000 --> 0:10:1,000
He was extremely happy to be with this rabbit.

239
0:10:11.499,000 --> 0:10:13,000
They groomed each other, they become close friends,

240
0:10:13.779,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and then the rabbit had bunnies,

241
0:10:16.482,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and Boonlua was even happier than he was before,

242
0:10:19.339,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and it had in a way given him

243
0:10:21.589,000 --> 0:10:22,000
a reason to wake up in the morning,

244
0:10:23.434,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and in fact it gave him such a reason to wake up

245
0:10:25.188,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that he decided not to sleep.

246
0:10:27.191,000 --> 0:10:3,000
He became extremely protective of these bunnies,

247
0:10:30.81,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and he stopped sleeping,

248
0:10:32.058,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and he would sort of nod off

249
0:10:33.499,000 --> 0:10:34,000
while trying to take care of them.

250
0:10:35.39,000 --> 0:10:37,000
In fact, he was so protective and so affectionate

251
0:10:37.833,000 --> 0:10:38,000
with these babies that the sanctuary

252
0:10:39.588,000 --> 0:10:41,000
eventually had to take them away from him

253
0:10:41.95,000 --> 0:10:42,000
because he was so protective, he was worried

254
0:10:43.885,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that their mother might hurt them.

255
0:10:45.764,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So after they were taken away, the sanctuary staff

256
0:10:47.608,000 --> 0:10:48,000
worried that he would fall into a depression,

257
0:10:49.217,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and so to avoid that,

258
0:10:50.449,000 --> 0:10:52,000
they gave him another rabbit friend.

259
0:10:53.447,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Laughter)

260
0:10:56.804,000 --> 0:10:58,000
My official opinion is that he does not look depressed.

261
0:10:59.509,000 --> 0:11:,000
(Laughter)

262
0:11:01.459,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So one thing that I would really like people to feel

263
0:11:05.821,000 --> 0:11:08,000
is that you really should feel empowered

264
0:11:08.9,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to make some assumptions

265
0:11:11.373,000 --> 0:11:12,000
about the creatures that you know well.

266
0:11:13.196,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So when it comes to your dog

267
0:11:14.996,000 --> 0:11:16,000
or your cat or maybe your one-armed monkey

268
0:11:17.314,000 --> 0:11:18,000
that you happen to know,

269
0:11:18.742,000 --> 0:11:21,000
if you think that they are traumatized or depressed,

270
0:11:22.537,000 --> 0:11:24,000
you're probably right.

271
0:11:24.663,000 --> 0:11:26,000
This is extremely anthropomorphic,

272
0:11:27.471,000 --> 0:11:29,000
or the assignation of human characteristics

273
0:11:30.464,000 --> 0:11:33,000
onto non-human animals or things.

274
0:11:34.116,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I don't think, though, that that's a problem.

275
0:11:36.257,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I don't think that we can not anthropomorphize.

276
0:11:38.349,000 --> 0:11:4,000
It's not as if you can take your human brain out of your head

277
0:11:41.251,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and put it in a jar and then use it

278
0:11:43.355,000 --> 0:11:45,000
to think about another animal thinking.

279
0:11:45.56,000 --> 0:11:47,000
We will always be one animal wondering

280
0:11:48.158,000 --> 0:11:5,000
about the emotional experience of another animal.

281
0:11:50.678,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So then the choice becomes, how do you anthropomorphize well?

282
0:11:53.671,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Or do you anthropomorphize poorly?

283
0:11:55.931,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And anthropomorphizing poorly

284
0:11:58.215,000 --> 0:12:,000
is all too common.

285
0:12:00.38,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Laughter)

286
0:12:02.012,000 --> 0:12:04,000
It may include dressing your corgis up and throwing them a wedding,

287
0:12:04.616,000 --> 0:12:06,000
or getting too close to exotic wildlife because

288
0:12:07.272,000 --> 0:12:08,000
you believe that you had a spiritual connection.

289
0:12:09.228,000 --> 0:12:1,000
There's all manner of things.

290
0:12:11.206,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Anthropomorphizing well, however, I believe is based

291
0:12:15.112,000 --> 0:12:17,000
on accepting our animal similarities with other species

292
0:12:17.83,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and using them to make assumptions

293
0:12:20.637,000 --> 0:12:23,000
that are informed about other animals' minds and experiences,

294
0:12:24.276,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and there's actually an entire industry

295
0:12:26.822,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that is in some ways based on anthropomorphizing well,

296
0:12:29.792,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and that is the psychopharmaceutical industry.

297
0:12:32.953,000 --> 0:12:36,000
One in five Americans is currently taking a psychopharmaceutical drug,

298
0:12:37.473,000 --> 0:12:39,000
from the antidepressants and antianxiety medications

299
0:12:40.128,000 --> 0:12:41,000
to the antipsychotics.

300
0:12:41.95,000 --> 0:12:42,000
It turns out that we owe this

301
0:12:43.784,000 --> 0:12:45,000
entire psychopharmaceutical arsenal

302
0:12:46.157,000 --> 0:12:47,000
to other animals.

303
0:12:47.889,000 --> 0:12:49,000
These drugs were tested in non-human animals first,

304
0:12:50.399,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and not just for toxicity but for behavioral effects.

305
0:12:54.335,000 --> 0:12:57,000
The very popular antipsychotic Thorazine

306
0:12:57.519,000 --> 0:13:,000
first relaxed rats before it relaxed people.

307
0:13:01.265,000 --> 0:13:03,000
The antianxiety medication Librium

308
0:13:03.426,000 --> 0:13:06,000
was given to cats selected for their meanness in the 1950s

309
0:13:07.249,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and made them into peaceable felines.

310
0:13:09.64,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And even antidepressants were first tested in rabbits.

311
0:13:14.2,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Today, however, we are not just giving these drugs

312
0:13:17.104,000 --> 0:13:19,000
to other animals as test subjects,

313
0:13:19.455,000 --> 0:13:21,000
but they're giving them these drugs as patients,

314
0:13:21.946,000 --> 0:13:25,000
both in ethical and much less ethical ways.

315
0:13:26.429,000 --> 0:13:29,000
SeaWorld gives mother orcas antianxiety medications

316
0:13:30.299,000 --> 0:13:32,000
when their calves are taken away.

317
0:13:32.943,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Many zoo gorillas have been given antipsychotics

318
0:13:35.226,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and antianxiety medications.

319
0:13:37.292,000 --> 0:13:39,000
But dogs like my own Oliver

320
0:13:40.165,000 --> 0:13:43,000
are given antidepressants and some antianxiety medications

321
0:13:43.404,000 --> 0:13:44,000
to keep them from jumping out of buildings

322
0:13:45.14,000 --> 0:13:47,000
or jumping into traffic.

323
0:13:47.203,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Just recently, actually, a study came out in "Science"

324
0:13:50.402,000 --> 0:13:51,000
that showed that even crawdads

325
0:13:52.231,000 --> 0:13:54,000
responded to antianxiety medication.

326
0:13:54.455,000 --> 0:13:56,000
It made them braver, less skittish,

327
0:13:56.73,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and more likely to explore their environment.

328
0:14:01.78,000 --> 0:14:03,000
It's hard to know how many animals are on these drugs,

329
0:14:04.138,000 --> 0:14:07,000
but I can tell you that the animal pharmaceutical industry

330
0:14:07.602,000 --> 0:14:08,000
is immense and growing,

331
0:14:09.39,000 --> 0:14:11,000
from seven billion dollars in 2011

332
0:14:12.113,000 --> 0:14:17,000
to a projected 9.25 billion by the year 2015.

333
0:14:17.692,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Some animals are on these drugs indefinitely.

334
0:14:21.539,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Others, like one bonobo who lives in Milwaukee

335
0:14:25.774,000 --> 0:14:26,000
at the zoo there was on them

336
0:14:27.36,000 --> 0:14:29,000
until he started to save his Paxil prescription

337
0:14:29.511,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and then distribute it among the other bonobos.

338
0:14:31.907,000 --> 0:14:36,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

339
0:14:36.916,000 --> 0:14:38,000
More than psychopharmaceuticals, though,

340
0:14:39.805,000 --> 0:14:41,000
there are many, many, many other

341
0:14:42.32,000 --> 0:14:44,000
therapeutic interventions that help other creatures.

342
0:14:44.968,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And here is a place where I think actually

343
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
that veterinary medicine can teach something

344
0:14:49.772,000 --> 0:14:5,000
to human medicine,

345
0:14:51.458,000 --> 0:14:52,000
which is, if you take your dog, who is, say,

346
0:14:53.348,000 --> 0:14:54,000
compulsively chasing his tail,

347
0:14:55.148,000 --> 0:14:56,000
into the veterinary behaviorist,

348
0:14:56.926,000 --> 0:14:58,000
their first action isn't to reach for the prescription pad;

349
0:14:59.73,000 --> 0:15:01,000
it's to ask you about your dog's life.

350
0:15:02.686,000 --> 0:15:04,000
They want to know how often your dog gets outside.

351
0:15:05.622,000 --> 0:15:07,000
They want to know how much exercise your dog is getting.

352
0:15:08.276,000 --> 0:15:09,000
They want to know how much social time

353
0:15:09.761,000 --> 0:15:11,000
with other dogs and other humans.

354
0:15:12.18,000 --> 0:15:14,000
They want to talk to you about what sorts of therapies,

355
0:15:14.39,000 --> 0:15:16,000
largely behavior therapies,

356
0:15:16.905,000 --> 0:15:18,000
you've tried with that animal.

357
0:15:19.165,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Those are the things that often tend to help the most,

358
0:15:21.562,000 --> 0:15:24,000
especially when combined with psychopharmaceuticals.

359
0:15:24.891,000 --> 0:15:26,000
The thing, though, I believe, that helps the most,

360
0:15:27.344,000 --> 0:15:28,000
particularly with social animals,

361
0:15:29.301,000 --> 0:15:32,000
is time with other social animals.

362
0:15:32.439,000 --> 0:15:35,000
In many ways, I feel like I became a service animal

363
0:15:36.347,000 --> 0:15:38,000
to my own dog,

364
0:15:38.851,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and I have seen parrots do it for people

365
0:15:42.878,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and people do it for parrots

366
0:15:44.588,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and dogs do it for elephants

367
0:15:46.126,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and elephants do it for other elephants.

368
0:15:49.304,000 --> 0:15:5,000
I don't know about you;

369
0:15:50.637,000 --> 0:15:52,000
I get a lot of Internet forwards

370
0:15:53.217,000 --> 0:15:55,000
of unlikely animal friendships.

371
0:15:55.433,000 --> 0:15:58,000
I also think it's a huge part of Facebook,

372
0:15:58.72,000 --> 0:16:,000
the monkey that adopts the cat

373
0:16:01.597,000 --> 0:16:05,000
or the great dane who adopted the orphaned fawn,

374
0:16:06.233,000 --> 0:16:09,000
or the cow that makes friends with the pig,

375
0:16:09.237,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and had you asked me eight, nine years ago, about these,

376
0:16:13.173,000 --> 0:16:15,000
I would have told you that they were hopelessly sentimental

377
0:16:15.663,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and maybe too anthropomorphic in the wrong way

378
0:16:18.786,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and maybe even staged, and what I can tell you now

379
0:16:21.565,000 --> 0:16:23,000
is that there is actually something to this.

380
0:16:24.517,000 --> 0:16:27,000
This is legit. In fact, some interesting studies

381
0:16:28.112,000 --> 0:16:29,000
have pointed to oxytocin levels,

382
0:16:30.038,000 --> 0:16:32,000
which are a kind of bonding hormone

383
0:16:32.634,000 --> 0:16:34,000
that we release when we're having sex or nursing

384
0:16:35.04,000 --> 0:16:37,000
or around someone that we care for extremely,

385
0:16:37.629,000 --> 0:16:39,000
oxytocin levels raising in both humans and dogs

386
0:16:40.121,000 --> 0:16:41,000
who care about each other

387
0:16:41.515,000 --> 0:16:42,000
or who enjoy each other's company,

388
0:16:43.175,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and beyond that, other studies show that oxytocin

389
0:16:45.484,000 --> 0:16:47,000
raised even in other pairs of animals,

390
0:16:47.62,000 --> 0:16:5,000
so, say, in goats and dogs who were friends and played with each other,

391
0:16:51.225,000 --> 0:16:55,000
their levels spiked afterwards.

392
0:16:55.684,000 --> 0:16:57,000
I have a friend who really showed me that

393
0:16:58.451,000 --> 0:17:,000
mental health is in fact a two-way street.

394
0:17:00.875,000 --> 0:17:03,000
His name is Lonnie Hodge, and he's a veteran of Vietnam.

395
0:17:04.874,000 --> 0:17:06,000
When he returned, he started working

396
0:17:07.496,000 --> 0:17:09,000
with survivors of genocide and a lot of people

397
0:17:10.139,000 --> 0:17:11,000
who had gone through war trauma.

398
0:17:11.667,000 --> 0:17:13,000
And he had PTSD and also a fear of heights,

399
0:17:14.151,000 --> 0:17:15,000
because in Vietnam, he had been

400
0:17:16.05,000 --> 0:17:18,000
rappelling backwards out of helicopters

401
0:17:18.295,000 --> 0:17:19,000
over the skids,

402
0:17:19.73,000 --> 0:17:22,000
and he was givena service dog named Gander, a labradoodle,

403
0:17:22.799,000 --> 0:17:25,000
to help him with PTSD and his fear of heights.

404
0:17:26.25,000 --> 0:17:28,000
This is them actually on the first day that they met,

405
0:17:28.91,000 --> 0:17:3,000
which is amazing, and since then,

406
0:17:31.502,000 --> 0:17:32,000
they've spent a lot of time together

407
0:17:33.267,000 --> 0:17:37,000
visiting with other veterans suffering from similar issues.

408
0:17:37.517,000 --> 0:17:4,000
But what's so interesting to me about Lonnie and Gander's relationship

409
0:17:40.579,000 --> 0:17:41,000
is about a few months in,

410
0:17:42.357,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Gander actually developed a fear of heights,

411
0:17:45.684,000 --> 0:17:49,000
probably because he was watching Lonnie so closely.

412
0:17:49.981,000 --> 0:17:52,000
What's pretty great about this, though, is that he's still a fantastic service dog,

413
0:17:53.45,000 --> 0:17:55,000
because now, when they're both at a great height,

414
0:17:55.985,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Lonnie is so concerned with Gander's well-being

415
0:17:59.343,000 --> 0:18:04,000
that he forgets to be scared of the heights himself.

416
0:18:05.317,000 --> 0:18:08,000
Since I've spent so much time with these stories,

417
0:18:08.598,000 --> 0:18:09,000
digging into archives,

418
0:18:10.002,000 --> 0:18:12,000
I literally spent years doing this research,

419
0:18:12.456,000 --> 0:18:14,000
and it's changed me.

420
0:18:14.756,000 --> 0:18:17,000
I no longer look at animals at the species level.

421
0:18:18.692,000 --> 0:18:2,000
I look at them as individuals,

422
0:18:20.92,000 --> 0:18:21,000
and I think about them as creatures

423
0:18:22.492,000 --> 0:18:24,000
with their own individual weather systems

424
0:18:25.251,000 --> 0:18:26,000
guiding their behavior and informing

425
0:18:26.963,000 --> 0:18:28,000
how they respond to the world.

426
0:18:29.272,000 --> 0:18:31,000
And I really believe that this has made me

427
0:18:32.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
a more curious and a more empathetic person,

428
0:18:34.524,000 --> 0:18:37,000
both to the animals that share my bed

429
0:18:37.967,000 --> 0:18:39,000
and occasionally wind up on my plate,

430
0:18:40.093,000 --> 0:18:42,000
but also to the people that I know

431
0:18:42.943,000 --> 0:18:44,000
who are suffering from anxiety

432
0:18:45.894,000 --> 0:18:47,000
and from phobias and all manner of other things,

433
0:18:48.521,000 --> 0:18:49,000
and I really do believe that

434
0:18:50.496,000 --> 0:18:52,000
even though you can't know exactly

435
0:18:52.744,000 --> 0:18:55,000
what's going on in the mind of a pig

436
0:18:56.131,000 --> 0:18:58,000
or your pug or your partner,

437
0:18:58.248,000 --> 0:19:01,000
that that shouldn't stop you from empathizing with them.

438
0:19:02.055,000 --> 0:19:04,000
The best thing that we could do for our loved ones

439
0:19:04.544,000 --> 0:19:08,000
is, perhaps, to anthropomorphize them.

440
0:19:08.84,000 --> 0:19:11,000
Charles Darwin's father once told him

441
0:19:12.341,000 --> 0:19:17,000
that everybody could lose their mind at some point.

442
0:19:17.56,000 --> 0:19:19,000
Thankfully, we can often find them again,

443
0:19:20.391,000 --> 0:19:22,000
but only with each other's help.

444
0:19:22.562,000 --> 0:19:24,000
Thank you.

445
0:19:24.618,000 --> 0:19:27,000
(Applause)

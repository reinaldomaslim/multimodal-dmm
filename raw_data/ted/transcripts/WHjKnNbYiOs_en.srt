0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
On January 26, 2013,

2
0:00:15.48,000 --> 0:00:18,000
a band of al-Qaeda militants entered the ancient city of Timbuktu

3
0:00:19,000 --> 0:00:21,000
on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert.

4
0:00:21.64,000 --> 0:00:25,000
There, they set fire to a medieval library of 30,000 manuscripts

5
0:00:26.28,000 --> 0:00:28,000
written in Arabic and several African languages

6
0:00:29.08,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and ranging in subject from astronomy to geography, history to medicine,

7
0:00:34.84,000 --> 0:00:35,000
including one book which records

8
0:00:36.56,000 --> 0:00:39,000
perhaps the first treatment for male erectile dysfunction.

9
0:00:41.76,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Unknown in the West,

10
0:00:43.08,000 --> 0:00:46,000
this was the collected wisdom of an entire continent,

11
0:00:46.52,000 --> 0:00:5,000
the voice of Africa at a time when Africa was thought not to have a voice at all.

12
0:00:51.48,000 --> 0:00:53,000
The mayor of Bamako, who witnessed the event,

13
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:55,000
called the burning of the manuscripts

14
0:00:55.96,000 --> 0:00:57,000
"a crime against world cultural heritage."

15
0:00:58.88,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And he was right --

16
0:01:00.44,000 --> 0:01:03,000
or he would have been, if it weren't for the fact that he was also lying.

17
0:01:04.56,000 --> 0:01:06,000
In fact, just before,

18
0:01:07.32,000 --> 0:01:11,000
African scholars had collected a random assortment of old books

19
0:01:11.48,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and left them out for the terrorists to burn.

20
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Today, the collection lies hidden in Bamako,

21
0:01:16.959,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the capital of Mali,

22
0:01:18.36,000 --> 0:01:2,000
moldering in the high humidity.

23
0:01:20.48,000 --> 0:01:21,000
What was rescued by ruse

24
0:01:22.36,000 --> 0:01:23,000
is now once again in jeopardy,

25
0:01:24.12,000 --> 0:01:25,000
this time by climate.

26
0:01:26.2,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But Africa, and the far-flung corners of the world,

27
0:01:28.64,000 --> 0:01:3,000
are not the only places, or even the main places

28
0:01:30.96,000 --> 0:01:34,000
in which manuscripts that could change the history of world culture

29
0:01:35.28,000 --> 0:01:36,000
are in jeopardy.

30
0:01:37.92,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Several years ago, I conducted a survey of European research libraries

31
0:01:42.68,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and discovered that, at the barest minimum,

32
0:01:44.96,000 --> 0:01:47,000
there are 60,000 manuscripts

33
0:01:48.2,000 --> 0:01:49,000
pre-1500

34
0:01:49.84,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that are illegible because of water damage,

35
0:01:52.8,000 --> 0:01:55,000
fading, mold and chemical reagents.

36
0:01:56.8,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The real number is likely double that,

37
0:01:59.8,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and that doesn't even count

38
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Renaissance manuscripts and modern manuscripts

39
0:02:04.64,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and cultural heritage objects such as maps.

40
0:02:09.96,000 --> 0:02:11,000
What if there were a technology

41
0:02:12.44,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that could recover these lost and unknown works?

42
0:02:17.8,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Imagine worldwide how a trove of hundreds of thousands

43
0:02:22.24,000 --> 0:02:24,000
of previously unknown texts

44
0:02:25.2,000 --> 0:02:28,000
could radically transform our knowledge of the past.

45
0:02:30.28,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Imagine what unknown classics we would discover

46
0:02:34.32,000 --> 0:02:37,000
which would rewrite the canons of literature, history,

47
0:02:37.68,000 --> 0:02:38,000
philosophy, music --

48
0:02:39.84,000 --> 0:02:42,000
or, more provocatively, that could rewrite our cultural identities,

49
0:02:43.4,000 --> 0:02:46,000
building new bridges between people and culture.

50
0:02:47.52,000 --> 0:02:49,000
These are the questions that transformed me

51
0:02:50.08,000 --> 0:02:52,000
from a medieval scholar, a reader of texts,

52
0:02:52.92,000 --> 0:02:53,000
into a textual scientist.

53
0:02:56.12,000 --> 0:02:58,000
What an unsatisfying word "reader" is.

54
0:02:58.44,000 --> 0:03:,000
For me, it conjures up images of passivity,

55
0:03:01.04,000 --> 0:03:03,000
of someone sitting idly in an armchair

56
0:03:03.48,000 --> 0:03:05,000
waiting for knowledge to come to him

57
0:03:05.8,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in a neat little parcel.

58
0:03:07.52,000 --> 0:03:1,000
How much better to be a participant in the past,

59
0:03:10.56,000 --> 0:03:13,000
an adventurer in an undiscovered country,

60
0:03:13.76,000 --> 0:03:15,000
searching for the hidden text.

61
0:03:17.36,000 --> 0:03:19,000
As an academic, I was a mere reader.

62
0:03:20.56,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I read and taught the same classics

63
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that people had been reading and teaching for hundreds of years --

64
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, Petrarch --

65
0:03:29.2,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and with every scholarly article that I published

66
0:03:31.56,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I added to human knowledge in ever-diminishing slivers of insight.

67
0:03:36.76,000 --> 0:03:37,000
What I wanted to be

68
0:03:38.36,000 --> 0:03:4,000
was an archaeologist of the past,

69
0:03:40.48,000 --> 0:03:41,000
a discoverer of literature,

70
0:03:42.08,000 --> 0:03:43,000
an Indiana Jones without the whip --

71
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:45,000
or, actually, with the whip.

72
0:03:45.52,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:46.76,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And I wanted it not just for myself but I wanted it for my students as well.

74
0:03:50.48,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And so six years ago, I changed the direction of my career.

75
0:03:54.4,000 --> 0:03:57,000
At the time, I was working on "The Chess of Love,"

76
0:03:57.44,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the last important long poem of the European Middle Ages

77
0:04:00.32,000 --> 0:04:01,000
never to have been edited.

78
0:04:01.96,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And it wasn't edited because it existed in only one manuscript

79
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:08,000
which was so badly damaged during the firebombing of Dresden

80
0:04:08.28,000 --> 0:04:09,000
in World War II

81
0:04:09.52,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that generations of scholars had pronounced it lost.

82
0:04:13.4,000 --> 0:04:16,000
For five years, I had been working with an ultraviolet lamp

83
0:04:16.88,000 --> 0:04:17,000
trying to recover traces of the writing

84
0:04:18.8,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and I'd gone about as far as technology at the time

85
0:04:21.24,000 --> 0:04:22,000
could actually take me.

86
0:04:22.64,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And so I did what many people do.

87
0:04:24.76,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I went online,

88
0:04:26.8,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and there I learned about

89
0:04:28.56,000 --> 0:04:32,000
how multispectral imaging had been used to recover two lost treatises

90
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
of the famed Greek mathematician Archimedes

91
0:04:36.08,000 --> 0:04:37,000
from a 13th-century palimpsest.

92
0:04:37.64,000 --> 0:04:4,000
A palimpsest is a manuscript which has been erased and overwritten.

93
0:04:42.2,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And so, out of the blue,

94
0:04:43.48,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I decided to write to the lead imaging scientist

95
0:04:46.56,000 --> 0:04:48,000
on the Archimedes palimpsest project,

96
0:04:48.8,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Professor Roger Easton,

97
0:04:50.32,000 --> 0:04:51,000
with a plan and a plea.

98
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And to my surprise, he actually wrote back.

99
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:59,000
With his help, I was able to win a grant from the US government

100
0:04:59.68,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to build a transportable, multispectral imaging lab,

101
0:05:03.72,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And with this lab, I transformed what was a charred and faded mess

102
0:05:08.56,000 --> 0:05:1,000
into a new medieval classic.

103
0:05:11.36,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So how does multispectral imaging actually work?

104
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Well, the idea behind multispectral imaging

105
0:05:16.64,000 --> 0:05:2,000
is something that anyone who is familiar with infrared night vision goggles

106
0:05:20.96,000 --> 0:05:21,000
will immediately appreciate:

107
0:05:22.36,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that what we can see in the visible spectrum of light

108
0:05:24.88,000 --> 0:05:26,000
is only a tiny fraction of what's actually there.

109
0:05:27.72,000 --> 0:05:29,000
The same is true with invisible writing.

110
0:05:31.28,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Our system uses 12 wavelengths of light

111
0:05:35.48,000 --> 0:05:37,000
between the ultraviolet and the infrared,

112
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and these are shown down onto the manuscript from above

113
0:05:41.08,000 --> 0:05:42,000
from banks of LEDs,

114
0:05:42.72,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and another multispectral light source

115
0:05:44.6,000 --> 0:05:46,000
which comes up through the individual leaves of the manuscript.

116
0:05:47.577,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Up to 35 images per sequence per leaf are imaged this way

117
0:05:52.12,000 --> 0:05:54,000
using a high-powered digital camera equipped with a lens

118
0:05:54.764,000 --> 0:05:55,000
which is made out of quartz.

119
0:05:56.76,000 --> 0:05:58,000
There are about five of these in the world.

120
0:05:58.88,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And once we capture these images,

121
0:06:00.72,000 --> 0:06:02,000
we feed them through statistical algorithms

122
0:06:02.8,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to further enhance and clarify them,

123
0:06:05.32,000 --> 0:06:08,000
using software which was originally designed for satellite images

124
0:06:08.72,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and used by people like geospatial scientists

125
0:06:12.12,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and the CIA.

126
0:06:14.04,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The results can be spectacular.

127
0:06:16.36,000 --> 0:06:18,000
You may already have heard of what's been done

128
0:06:18.56,000 --> 0:06:19,000
for the Dead Sea Scrolls,

129
0:06:19.96,000 --> 0:06:2,000
which are slowly gelatinizing.

130
0:06:22.48,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Using infrared, we've been able to read even the darkest corners

131
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

132
0:06:28.88,000 --> 0:06:29,000
You may not be aware, however,

133
0:06:30.36,000 --> 0:06:32,000
of other Biblical texts that are in jeopardy.

134
0:06:33.12,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Here, for example, is a leaf from a manuscript

135
0:06:36.56,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that we imaged,

136
0:06:38.36,000 --> 0:06:41,000
which is perhaps the most valuable Christian Bible in the world.

137
0:06:42.88,000 --> 0:06:47,000
The Codex Vercellensis is the oldest translation of the Gospels into Latin,

138
0:06:48.68,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and it dates from the first half of the fourth century.

139
0:06:52.56,000 --> 0:06:54,000
This is the closest we can come

140
0:06:54.84,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to the Bible at the time of the foundation of Christendom

141
0:06:58.8,000 --> 0:06:59,000
under Emperor Constantine,

142
0:07:00.44,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and at the time also of the Council of Nicaea,

143
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:06,000
when the basic creed of Christianity was being agreed upon.

144
0:07:06.52,000 --> 0:07:09,000
This manuscript, unfortunately, has been very badly damaged,

145
0:07:09.8,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and it's damaged because for centuries

146
0:07:12.04,000 --> 0:07:14,000
it had been used and handled

147
0:07:14.52,000 --> 0:07:16,000
in swearing in ceremonies in the church.

148
0:07:17.24,000 --> 0:07:21,000
In fact, that purple splotch that you see in the upper left hand corner

149
0:07:21.92,000 --> 0:07:25,000
is Aspergillus, which is a fungus

150
0:07:26.24,000 --> 0:07:29,000
which originates in the unwashed hands

151
0:07:29.8,000 --> 0:07:31,000
of a person with tuberculosis.

152
0:07:32.64,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Our imaging has enabled me to make the first transcription

153
0:07:35.72,000 --> 0:07:37,000
of this manuscript in 250 years.

154
0:07:39.8,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Having a lab that can travel to collections where it's needed, however,

155
0:07:43.28,000 --> 0:07:44,000
is only part of the solution.

156
0:07:45.48,000 --> 0:07:47,000
The technology is expensive and very rare,

157
0:07:48.36,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and the imaging and image processing skills are esoteric.

158
0:07:51.6,000 --> 0:07:52,000
That means that mounting recoveries

159
0:07:53.32,000 --> 0:07:57,000
is beyond the reach of most researchers and all but the wealthiest institutions.

160
0:07:58.24,000 --> 0:08:,000
That's why I founded the Lazarus Project,

161
0:08:01.04,000 --> 0:08:02,000
a not-for-profit initiative

162
0:08:02.72,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to bring multispectral imaging to individual researchers

163
0:08:06.72,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and smaller institutions at little or no cost whatsoever.

164
0:08:11.56,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Over the past five years,

165
0:08:13.2,000 --> 0:08:16,000
our team of imaging scientists, scholars and students

166
0:08:17.08,000 --> 0:08:19,000
has travelled to seven different countries

167
0:08:19.28,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and have recovered some of the world's most valuable damaged manuscripts,

168
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
included the Vercelli Book, which is the oldest book of English,

169
0:08:26.184,000 --> 0:08:28,000
the Black Book of Carmarthen, the oldest book of Welsh,

170
0:08:28.824,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and some of the most valuable earliest Gospels

171
0:08:32.32,000 --> 0:08:34,000
located in what is now the former Soviet Georgia.

172
0:08:36.6,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So, spectral imaging can recover lost texts.

173
0:08:40.36,000 --> 0:08:45,000
More subtly, though, it can recover a second story behind every object,

174
0:08:45.48,000 --> 0:08:49,000
the story of how, when and by whom a text was created,

175
0:08:50.2,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and, sometimes, what the author was thinking at the time he wrote.

176
0:08:54.6,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Take, for example, a draft of the Declaration of Independence

177
0:08:57.72,000 --> 0:08:59,000
written in Thomas Jefferson's own hand,

178
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
which some colleagues of mine imaged a few years ago

179
0:09:02.613,000 --> 0:09:03,000
at the Library of Congress.

180
0:09:04.36,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Curators had noticed that one word throughout

181
0:09:07.08,000 --> 0:09:09,000
had been scratched out and overwritten.

182
0:09:09.48,000 --> 0:09:11,000
The word overwritten was "citizens."

183
0:09:12.24,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Perhaps you can guess what the word underneath was.

184
0:09:15.96,000 --> 0:09:16,000
"Subjects."

185
0:09:17.4,000 --> 0:09:19,000
There, ladies and gentlemen, is American democracy

186
0:09:20.24,000 --> 0:09:22,000
evolving under the hand of Thomas Jefferson.

187
0:09:23.36,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Or consider the 1491 Martellus Map,

188
0:09:27.24,000 --> 0:09:29,000
which we imaged at Yale's Beinecke Library.

189
0:09:29.6,000 --> 0:09:31,000
This was the map that Columbus likely consulted

190
0:09:32.08,000 --> 0:09:33,000
before he traveled to the New World

191
0:09:33.8,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and which gave him his idea of what Asia looked like

192
0:09:36.56,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and where Japan was located.

193
0:09:39.64,000 --> 0:09:42,000
The problem with this map is that its inks and pigments

194
0:09:42.68,000 --> 0:09:44,000
had so degraded over time

195
0:09:44.8,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that this large, nearly seven-foot map,

196
0:09:46.96,000 --> 0:09:48,000
made the world look like a giant desert.

197
0:09:49.52,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Until now, we had very little idea, detailed idea, that is,

198
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
of what Columbus knew of the world

199
0:09:54.84,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and how world cultures were represented.

200
0:09:57.24,000 --> 0:10:01,000
The main legend of the map was entirely illegible under normal light.

201
0:10:01.4,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Ultraviolet did very little for it.

202
0:10:03.68,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Multispectral gave us everything.

203
0:10:06.64,000 --> 0:10:09,000
In Asia, we learned of monsters with ears so long

204
0:10:10.24,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that they could cover the creature's entire body.

205
0:10:13.04,000 --> 0:10:17,000
In Africa, about a snake who could cause the ground to smoke.

206
0:10:18.68,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Like starlight, which can convey images

207
0:10:20.96,000 --> 0:10:22,000
of the way the Universe looked in the distant past,

208
0:10:23.56,000 --> 0:10:26,000
so multispectral light can take us back to the first stuttering moments

209
0:10:27.48,000 --> 0:10:28,000
of an object's creation.

210
0:10:29.48,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Through this lens, we witness the mistakes, the changes of mind,

211
0:10:33.44,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the naïvetés, the uncensored thoughts,

212
0:10:36.36,000 --> 0:10:38,000
the imperfections of the human imagination

213
0:10:38.6,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that allow these hallowed objects and their authors

214
0:10:41.44,000 --> 0:10:42,000
to become more real,

215
0:10:43.12,000 --> 0:10:45,000
that make history closer to us.

216
0:10:46.76,000 --> 0:10:47,000
What about the future?

217
0:10:48.48,000 --> 0:10:5,000
There's so much of the past,

218
0:10:50.68,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and so few people with the skills to rescue it

219
0:10:53.92,000 --> 0:10:56,000
before these objects disappear forever.

220
0:10:58.48,000 --> 0:11:01,000
That's why I have begun to teach this new hybrid discipline

221
0:11:01.8,000 --> 0:11:02,000
that I call "textual science."

222
0:11:03.72,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Textual science is a marriage

223
0:11:05.36,000 --> 0:11:07,000
of the traditional skills of a literary scholar --

224
0:11:07.76,000 --> 0:11:09,000
the ability to read old languages and old handwriting,

225
0:11:10.32,000 --> 0:11:11,000
the knowledge of how texts are made

226
0:11:12.04,000 --> 0:11:14,000
in order to be able to place and date them --

227
0:11:14.2,000 --> 0:11:16,000
with new techniques like imaging science,

228
0:11:16.96,000 --> 0:11:18,000
the chemistry of inks and pigments,

229
0:11:19.56,000 --> 0:11:21,000
computer-aided optical character recognition.

230
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Last year, a student in my class,

231
0:11:25.36,000 --> 0:11:26,000
a freshman,

232
0:11:26.6,000 --> 0:11:27,000
with a background in Latin and Greek,

233
0:11:28.44,000 --> 0:11:3,000
was image-processing a palimpsest

234
0:11:30.8,000 --> 0:11:32,000
that we had photographed at a famous library in Rome.

235
0:11:34.24,000 --> 0:11:38,000
As he worked, tiny Greek writing began to appear from behind the text.

236
0:11:40.2,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Everyone gathered around,

237
0:11:41.72,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and he read a line from a lost work

238
0:11:44.4,000 --> 0:11:46,000
of the Greek comic dramatist Menander.

239
0:11:47.76,000 --> 0:11:49,000
This was the first time in well over a thousand years

240
0:11:50.48,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that those words had been pronounced aloud.

241
0:11:53.88,000 --> 0:11:55,000
In that moment, he became a scholar.

242
0:11:57.44,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Ladies and gentlemen, that is the future of the past.

243
0:12:00.84,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Thank you very much.

244
0:12:02.08,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.653,000 --> 0:00:14,000
We are all activists now.

2
0:00:15.42,000 --> 0:00:16,000
(Applause)

3
0:00:16.74,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Thank you.

4
0:00:18.5,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'll just stop here.

5
0:00:19.859,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:21.06,000 --> 0:00:25,000
From the families who are fighting to maintain funding for public schools,

7
0:00:26.46,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the tens of thousands of people who joined Occupy Wall Street

8
0:00:30.86,000 --> 0:00:32,000
or marched with Black Lives Matter

9
0:00:33.06,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to protest police brutality against African Americans,

10
0:00:37.58,000 --> 0:00:39,000
families that join rallies,

11
0:00:40.1,000 --> 0:00:42,000
pro-life and pro-choice,

12
0:00:43.42,000 --> 0:00:44,000
those of us who are afraid

13
0:00:45.18,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that our friends and neighbors are going to be deported

14
0:00:48.58,000 --> 0:00:49,000
or that they'll be added to lists

15
0:00:50.58,000 --> 0:00:51,000
because they are Muslim,

16
0:00:53.3,000 --> 0:00:57,000
people who advocate for gun rights and for gun control

17
0:00:58.46,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and the millions of people who joined the women's marches

18
0:01:01.98,000 --> 0:01:03,000
all across the country this last January.

19
0:01:04.78,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Applause)

20
0:01:07.46,000 --> 0:01:09,000
We are all activists now,

21
0:01:09.58,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and that means that we all have something to worry about from surveillance.

22
0:01:15.14,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Surveillance means government collection and use

23
0:01:17.86,000 --> 0:01:2,000
of private and sensitive data about us.

24
0:01:21.1,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And surveillance is essential

25
0:01:23.06,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to law enforcement and to national security.

26
0:01:26.18,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But the history of surveillance

27
0:01:28.18,000 --> 0:01:31,000
is one that includes surveillance abuses

28
0:01:31.7,000 --> 0:01:34,000
where this sensitive information has been used against people

29
0:01:35.18,000 --> 0:01:36,000
because of their race,

30
0:01:36.74,000 --> 0:01:37,000
their national origin,

31
0:01:38.54,000 --> 0:01:4,000
their sexual orientation,

32
0:01:40.62,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and in particular, because of their activism,

33
0:01:43.82,000 --> 0:01:44,000
their political beliefs.

34
0:01:46.58,000 --> 0:01:48,000
About 53 years ago,

35
0:01:49.22,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his "I have a dream" speech

36
0:01:52.78,000 --> 0:01:53,000
on the Mall in Washington.

37
0:01:54.86,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And today the ideas behind this speech of racial equality and tolerance

38
0:01:59.58,000 --> 0:02:,000
are so noncontroversial

39
0:02:01.54,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that my daughters study the speech in third grade.

40
0:02:04.98,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But at the time,

41
0:02:06.34,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Dr. King was extremely controversial.

42
0:02:09.34,000 --> 0:02:14,000
The legendary and notorious FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover believed,

43
0:02:14.86,000 --> 0:02:15,000
or wanted to believe,

44
0:02:16.7,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that the Civil Rights Movement was a Soviet communist plot

45
0:02:20.299,000 --> 0:02:23,000
intended to destabilize the American government.

46
0:02:23.9,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And so Hoover had his agents put bugs in Dr. King's hotel rooms,

47
0:02:30.18,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and those bugs picked up conversations between civil rights leaders

48
0:02:35.74,000 --> 0:02:39,000
talking about the strategies and tactics of the Civil Rights Movement.

49
0:02:40.9,000 --> 0:02:42,000
They also picked up sounds of Dr. King

50
0:02:43.14,000 --> 0:02:45,000
having sex with women who were not his wife,

51
0:02:46.02,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and J. Edgar Hoover saw the opportunity here

52
0:02:48.78,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to discredit and undermine the Civil Rights Movement.

53
0:02:53.22,000 --> 0:02:56,000
The FBI sent a package of these recordings

54
0:02:56.86,000 --> 0:02:59,000
along with a handwritten note to Dr. King,

55
0:03:00.7,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and a draft of this note was found in FBI archives years later,

56
0:03:07.1,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and the letter said,

57
0:03:08.86,000 --> 0:03:1,000
"You are no clergyman and you know it.

58
0:03:11.66,000 --> 0:03:14,000
King, like all frauds, your end is approaching."

59
0:03:15.86,000 --> 0:03:19,000
The letter even seemed to encourage Dr. King to commit suicide,

60
0:03:21.38,000 --> 0:03:24,000
saying, "King, there is only one thing left for you to do.

61
0:03:25.18,000 --> 0:03:26,000
You know what it is.

62
0:03:26.78,000 --> 0:03:3,000
You better take it before your filthy, abnormal, fraudulent self

63
0:03:31.14,000 --> 0:03:32,000
is bared to the nation."

64
0:03:33.02,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But the important thing is,

65
0:03:34.46,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Dr. King was not abnormal.

66
0:03:36.7,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Every one of us has something that we want to hide from somebody.

67
0:03:41.82,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And even more important,

68
0:03:43.66,000 --> 0:03:45,000
J. Edgar Hoover wasn't abnormal either.

69
0:03:46.9,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The history of surveillance abuses

70
0:03:48.86,000 --> 0:03:51,000
is not the history of one bad, megalomaniacal man.

71
0:03:52.9,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Throughout his decades at the FBI,

72
0:03:55.94,000 --> 0:03:58,000
J. Edgar Hoover enjoyed the support of the presidents that he served,

73
0:03:59.7,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Democratic and Republican alike.

74
0:04:02.5,000 --> 0:04:05,000
After all, it was John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert Kennedy

75
0:04:05.86,000 --> 0:04:07,000
who knew about and approved the surveillance of Dr. King.

76
0:04:10.46,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Hoover ran a program called COINTELPRO for 15 years

77
0:04:14.9,000 --> 0:04:18,000
which was designed to spy on and undermine civic groups

78
0:04:19.7,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that were devoted to things like civil rights,

79
0:04:22.46,000 --> 0:04:23,000
the Women's Rights Movement,

80
0:04:24.22,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and peace groups and anti-war movements.

81
0:04:26.98,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And the surveillance didn't stop there.

82
0:04:29.779,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Lyndon Baines Johnson,

83
0:04:31.5,000 --> 0:04:33,000
during the election campaign,

84
0:04:33.54,000 --> 0:04:38,000
had the campaign airplane of his rival Barry Goldwater bugged

85
0:04:39.54,000 --> 0:04:41,000
as part of his effort to win that election.

86
0:04:43.02,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And then, of course, there was Watergate.

87
0:04:47.34,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Burglars were caught

88
0:04:48.82,000 --> 0:04:5,000
breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters

89
0:04:51.7,000 --> 0:04:52,000
at the Watergate Hotel,

90
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the Nixon administration was involved in covering up the burglary,

91
0:04:57.46,000 --> 0:05:,000
and eventually Nixon had to step down as president.

92
0:05:01.86,000 --> 0:05:05,000
COINTELPRO and Watergate were a wake-up call for Americans.

93
0:05:06.62,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Surveillance was out of control

94
0:05:08.5,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and it was being used to squelch political challengers.

95
0:05:13.06,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And so Americans rose to the occasion

96
0:05:15.62,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and what we did was we reformed surveillance law.

97
0:05:19.98,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And the primary tool we used to reform surveillance law

98
0:05:24.38,000 --> 0:05:26,000
was to require a search warrant

99
0:05:27.1,000 --> 0:05:32,000
for the government to be able to get access to our phone calls and our letters.

100
0:05:33.54,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Now, the reason why a search warrant is important

101
0:05:36.42,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is because it interposes a judge

102
0:05:38.78,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in the relationship between investigators and the citizens,

103
0:05:42.42,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and that judge's job is to make sure

104
0:05:45.42,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that there's good cause for the surveillance,

105
0:05:48.06,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that the surveillance is targeted at the right people,

106
0:05:51.5,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and that the information that's collected

107
0:05:54.02,000 --> 0:05:57,000
is going to be used for legitimate government purposes

108
0:05:57.66,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and not for discriminatory ones.

109
0:06:00.62,000 --> 0:06:01,000
This was our system,

110
0:06:01.86,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and what this means is

111
0:06:03.14,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that President Obama did not wiretap Trump Tower.

112
0:06:06.98,000 --> 0:06:1,000
The system is set up to prevent something like that from happening

113
0:06:11.82,000 --> 0:06:12,000
without a judge being involved.

114
0:06:14.3,000 --> 0:06:18,000
But what happens when we're not talking about phone calls or letters anymore?

115
0:06:20.34,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Today, we have technology

116
0:06:23.06,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that makes it cheap and easy for the government to collect information

117
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
on ordinary everyday people.

118
0:06:30.38,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Your phone call records

119
0:06:33.1,000 --> 0:06:36,000
can reveal whether you have an addiction,

120
0:06:36.74,000 --> 0:06:37,000
what your religion is,

121
0:06:38.22,000 --> 0:06:4,000
what charities you donate to,

122
0:06:40.9,000 --> 0:06:42,000
what political candidate you support.

123
0:06:43.86,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And yet, our government collected, dragnet-style,

124
0:06:47.98,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Americans' calling records for years.

125
0:06:52.14,000 --> 0:06:56,000
In 2012, the Republican National Convention

126
0:06:56.3,000 --> 0:06:59,000
highlighted a new technology it was planning to use,

127
0:06:59.7,000 --> 0:07:,000
facial recognition,

128
0:07:01.22,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to identify people who were going to be in the crowd

129
0:07:04.22,000 --> 0:07:06,000
who might be activists or troublemakers

130
0:07:06.7,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and to stop them ahead of time.

131
0:07:09.02,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Today, over 50 percent of American adults

132
0:07:12.74,000 --> 0:07:14,000
have their faceprint in a government database.

133
0:07:15.74,000 --> 0:07:18,000
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives

134
0:07:19.06,000 --> 0:07:2,000
concocted a plan

135
0:07:20.62,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to find out what Americans were going to gun shows

136
0:07:24.18,000 --> 0:07:26,000
by using license plate detectors

137
0:07:26.7,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to scan the license plates of cars

138
0:07:28.82,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that were in the parking lots of these events.

139
0:07:31.7,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Today, we believe that over 70 percent of police departments

140
0:07:36.14,000 --> 0:07:39,000
have automatic license plate detection technology

141
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that they're using to track people's cars as they drive through town.

142
0:07:43.78,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And all of this information,

143
0:07:46.42,000 --> 0:07:48,000
the license plates, the faceprints,

144
0:07:49.38,000 --> 0:07:5,000
the phone records,

145
0:07:50.98,000 --> 0:07:52,000
your address books, your buddy lists,

146
0:07:53.82,000 --> 0:07:57,000
the photos that you upload to Dropbox or Google Photos,

147
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and sometimes even your chats and your emails

148
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
are not protected by a warrant requirement.

149
0:08:05.58,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So what that means is we have all of this information on regular people

150
0:08:11.18,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that's newly available at very low expense.

151
0:08:14.86,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It is the golden age for surveillance.

152
0:08:18.3,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Now, every parent is going to understand what this means.

153
0:08:23.62,000 --> 0:08:25,000
When you have a little baby

154
0:08:25.78,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and the baby's young,

155
0:08:27.74,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that child is not able to climb out of its crib.

156
0:08:31.02,000 --> 0:08:33,000
But eventually your little girl gets older

157
0:08:33.94,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and she's able to climb out of the crib,

158
0:08:36.9,000 --> 0:08:39,000
but you tell her, "Don't climb out of the crib. OK?"

159
0:08:40.7,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And every parent knows what's going to happen.

160
0:08:42.9,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Some of those babies are going to climb out of the crib.

161
0:08:46.379,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Right? That's the difference between ability and permission.

162
0:08:50.06,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Well, the same thing is true with the government today.

163
0:08:52.7,000 --> 0:08:54,000
It used to be that our government didn't have the ability

164
0:08:55.499,000 --> 0:08:58,000
to do widespread, massive surveillance on hundreds of millions of Americans

165
0:08:59.1,000 --> 0:09:,000
and then abuse that information.

166
0:09:01.34,000 --> 0:09:02,000
But now our government has grown up,

167
0:09:03.22,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and we have that technology today.

168
0:09:06.02,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The government has the ability,

169
0:09:08.62,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and that means the law is more important than ever before.

170
0:09:12.22,000 --> 0:09:13,000
The law is supposed to say

171
0:09:13.98,000 --> 0:09:17,000
when the government has permission to do it,

172
0:09:18.02,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and it's supposed to ensure that there's some kind of ramification.

173
0:09:22.18,000 --> 0:09:24,000
We notice when those laws are broken

174
0:09:24.7,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and there's some of kind of ramification or punishment.

175
0:09:27.42,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The law is more important than ever because we are now living in a world

176
0:09:30.86,000 --> 0:09:32,000
where only rules are stopping the government

177
0:09:32.98,000 --> 0:09:33,000
from abusing this information.

178
0:09:34.94,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But the law has fallen down on the job.

179
0:09:37.66,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Particularly since September 11 the law has fallen down on the job,

180
0:09:41.62,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and we do not have the rules in place that we need.

181
0:09:45.22,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And we are seeing the ramifications of that.

182
0:09:48.02,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So fusion centers are these joint task forces

183
0:09:51.3,000 --> 0:09:53,000
between local, state and federal government

184
0:09:53.62,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that are meant to ferret out domestic terrorism.

185
0:09:56.86,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And what we've seen is fusion center reports

186
0:09:59.38,000 --> 0:10:02,000
that say that you might be dangerous

187
0:10:03.18,000 --> 0:10:05,000
if you voted for a third-party candidate,

188
0:10:06.14,000 --> 0:10:09,000
or you own a "Don't Tread On Me" flag,

189
0:10:09.34,000 --> 0:10:12,000
or you watched movies that are anti-tax.

190
0:10:13.7,000 --> 0:10:17,000
These same fusion centers have spied on Muslim community groups' reading lists

191
0:10:18.5,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and on Quakers who are resisting military recruiting in high schools.

192
0:10:24.5,000 --> 0:10:28,000
The Internal Revenue Service has disproportionately audited

193
0:10:28.7,000 --> 0:10:31,000
groups that have "Tea Party" or "Patriot" in their name.

194
0:10:32.38,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And now customs and border patrol

195
0:10:34.98,000 --> 0:10:36,000
is stopping people as they come into the country

196
0:10:37.78,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and demanding our social networking passwords

197
0:10:40.98,000 --> 0:10:42,000
which will allow them to see who our friends are,

198
0:10:43.58,000 --> 0:10:44,000
what we say

199
0:10:44.82,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and even to impersonate us online.

200
0:10:48.34,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Now, civil libertarians like myself

201
0:10:51.02,000 --> 0:10:55,000
have been trying to draw people's attention to these things

202
0:10:55.18,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and fighting against them for years.

203
0:10:57.78,000 --> 0:11:01,000
This was a huge problem during the Obama administration,

204
0:11:02.78,000 --> 0:11:04,000
but now the problem is worse.

205
0:11:06.34,000 --> 0:11:08,000
When the New York Police Department

206
0:11:08.82,000 --> 0:11:09,000
spies on Muslims

207
0:11:10.54,000 --> 0:11:13,000
or a police department uses license plate detectors

208
0:11:14.42,000 --> 0:11:17,000
to find out where the officers' spouses are

209
0:11:18.34,000 --> 0:11:19,000
or those sorts of things,

210
0:11:19.62,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that is extremely dangerous.

211
0:11:21.74,000 --> 0:11:24,000
But when a president repurposes the power

212
0:11:24.82,000 --> 0:11:26,000
of federal surveillance and the federal government

213
0:11:27.34,000 --> 0:11:3,000
to retaliate against political opposition,

214
0:11:30.42,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that is a tyranny.

215
0:11:32.3,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And so we are all activists now,

216
0:11:36.46,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and we all have something to fear from surveillance.

217
0:11:40.58,000 --> 0:11:43,000
But just like in the time of Dr. Martin Luther King,

218
0:11:44.38,000 --> 0:11:46,000
we can reform the way things are.

219
0:11:47.74,000 --> 0:11:49,000
First of all, use encryption.

220
0:11:50.94,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Encryption protects your information

221
0:11:53.86,000 --> 0:11:57,000
from being inexpensively and opportunistically collected.

222
0:11:58.7,000 --> 0:12:01,000
It rolls back the golden age for surveillance.

223
0:12:03.9,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Second, support surveillance reform.

224
0:12:07.54,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Did you know that if you have a friend

225
0:12:09.74,000 --> 0:12:12,000
who works for the French or German governments

226
0:12:12.86,000 --> 0:12:15,000
or for an international human rights group

227
0:12:16.02,000 --> 0:12:19,000
or for a global oil company

228
0:12:19.42,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that your friend is a valid foreign intelligence target?

229
0:12:23.74,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And what that means is that when you have conversations with that friend,

230
0:12:27.9,000 --> 0:12:3,000
the US government may be collecting that information.

231
0:12:32.14,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And when that information is collected,

232
0:12:35.42,000 --> 0:12:37,000
even though it's conversations with Americans,

233
0:12:37.62,000 --> 0:12:4,000
it can then be funneled to the FBI

234
0:12:40.74,000 --> 0:12:42,000
where the FBI is allowed to search through it

235
0:12:43.22,000 --> 0:12:44,000
without getting a warrant,

236
0:12:44.62,000 --> 0:12:45,000
without probable cause,

237
0:12:46.3,000 --> 0:12:48,000
looking for information about Americans

238
0:12:48.54,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and whatever crimes we may have committed

239
0:12:51.98,000 --> 0:12:54,000
with no need to document any kind of suspicion.

240
0:12:55.74,000 --> 0:12:57,000
The law that allows some of this to happen

241
0:12:58.74,000 --> 0:13:02,000
is called Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act,

242
0:13:02.86,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and we have a great opportunity this year,

243
0:13:05.42,000 --> 0:13:09,000
because Section 702 is going to expire at the end of 2017,

244
0:13:10.18,000 --> 0:13:14,000
which means that Congress's inertia is on our side

245
0:13:14.82,000 --> 0:13:15,000
if we want reform.

246
0:13:16.42,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And we can pressure our representatives

247
0:13:20.14,000 --> 0:13:23,000
to actually implement important reforms to this law

248
0:13:23.66,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and protect our data from this redirection and misuse.

249
0:13:28.38,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And finally, one of the reasons why things have gotten so out of control

250
0:13:33.42,000 --> 0:13:35,000
is because so much of what happens with surveillance --

251
0:13:36.34,000 --> 0:13:4,000
the technology, the enabling rules and the policies

252
0:13:40.9,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that are either there or not there to protect us --

253
0:13:44.5,000 --> 0:13:46,000
are secret or classified.

254
0:13:46.94,000 --> 0:13:5,000
We need transparency, and we need to know as Americans

255
0:13:51.18,000 --> 0:13:53,000
what the government is doing in our name

256
0:13:53.74,000 --> 0:13:57,000
so that the surveillance that takes place and the use of that information

257
0:13:58.34,000 --> 0:14:,000
is democratically accounted for.

258
0:14:02.22,000 --> 0:14:04,000
We are all activists now,

259
0:14:04.34,000 --> 0:14:07,000
which means that we all have something to worry about from surveillance.

260
0:14:08.54,000 --> 0:14:11,000
But like in the time of Dr. Martin Luther King,

261
0:14:11.98,000 --> 0:14:13,000
there is stuff that we can do about it.

262
0:14:14.3,000 --> 0:14:17,000
So please join me, and let's get to work.

263
0:14:18.82,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Thank you.

264
0:14:20.06,000 --> 0:14:23,000
(Applause)

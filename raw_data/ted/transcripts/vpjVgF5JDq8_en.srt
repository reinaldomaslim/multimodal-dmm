1
0:00:12.8,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Here's my thing.

2
0:00:14.72,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Hold on. There I go. Hey.

3
0:00:18.24,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I want to start today -- talk about the structure of a polypeptide.

4
0:00:21.47,000 --> 0:00:23,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:23.84,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I get a lot of people asking me, in terms of "Lost," you know,

6
0:00:28.04,000 --> 0:00:29,000
"What the hell's that island?"

7
0:00:29.52,000 --> 0:00:31,000
You know, it's usually followed by,

8
0:00:32.48,000 --> 0:00:34,000
"No, seriously, what the hell is that island?"

9
0:00:34.68,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Why so many mysteries?

10
0:00:35.96,000 --> 0:00:38,000
What is it about mystery that I seem to be drawn to?

11
0:00:39.92,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And I was thinking about this, what to talk about at TED.

12
0:00:42.64,000 --> 0:00:45,000
When I talked to the kind rep from TED,

13
0:00:45.84,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and I said, "Listen, you know, what should I talk about?"

14
0:00:48.56,000 --> 0:00:5,000
He said, "Don't worry about it. Just be profound."

15
0:00:50.96,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:52.28,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And I took enormous comfort in that.

17
0:00:54.04,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So thank you, if you're here.

18
0:00:55.68,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I was trying to think, what do I talk about? Good question.

19
0:00:58.52,000 --> 0:01:,000
Why do I do so much stuff that involves mystery?

20
0:01:00.8,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And I started trying to figure it out.

21
0:01:02.68,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And I started thinking about why do I do any of what I do,

22
0:01:05.44,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and I started thinking about my grandfather.

23
0:01:07.56,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I loved my grandfather.

24
0:01:09.36,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Harry Kelvin was his name, my mother's father.

25
0:01:12.48,000 --> 0:01:14,000
He died in 1986. He was an amazing guy.

26
0:01:15.24,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And one of the reasons he was amazing:

27
0:01:17.119,000 --> 0:01:19,000
After World War II, he began an electronics company.

28
0:01:19.572,000 --> 0:01:23,000
He started selling surplus parts, kits, to schools and stuff.

29
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So he had this incredible curiosity.

30
0:01:25.96,000 --> 0:01:26,000
As a kid, I saw him come over to me

31
0:01:27.88,000 --> 0:01:29,000
with radios and telephones and all sorts of things.

32
0:01:30.32,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And he'd open them up, he'd unscrew them and reveal the inner workings --

33
0:01:33.8,000 --> 0:01:35,000
which many of us, I'm sure, take for granted.

34
0:01:35.96,000 --> 0:01:37,000
But it's an amazing gift to give a kid.

35
0:01:38.56,000 --> 0:01:4,000
To open up this thing and show how it works

36
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and why it works and what it is.

37
0:01:42.8,000 --> 0:01:44,000
He was the ultimate deconstructor, in many ways.

38
0:01:45.8,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And my grandfather was a kind of guy who would not only take things apart,

39
0:01:52.08,000 --> 0:01:55,000
but he got me interested in all sorts of different odd crafts,

40
0:01:55.36,000 --> 0:01:58,000
like, you know, printing, like the letter press.

41
0:01:58.52,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I'm obsessed with printing.

42
0:01:59.92,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I'm obsessed with silk-screening and bookbinding and box making.

43
0:02:03.4,000 --> 0:02:07,000
When I was a kid, I was always, like, taking apart boxes and stuff.

44
0:02:07.68,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And last night in the hotel, I took apart the Kleenex box.

45
0:02:10.44,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I was just looking at it. And I'm telling you --

46
0:02:12.8,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:14.24,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It's a beautiful thing. I swear to God.

48
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I mean, when you look at the box and you sort of see how it works.

49
0:02:19.32,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Rives is here, and I met him years ago at a book fair;

50
0:02:21.919,000 --> 0:02:22,000
he does pop-up books.

51
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And I'm obsessed with engineering of paper.

52
0:02:25.24,000 --> 0:02:26,000
The scoring of it, the printing of it,

53
0:02:27.12,000 --> 0:02:29,000
where the thing gets glued, the registration marks for the ink.

54
0:02:30.12,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I just love boxes.

55
0:02:31.36,000 --> 0:02:32,000
My grandfather was the guy

56
0:02:32.64,000 --> 0:02:34,000
who kind of got me into all sorts of these things.

57
0:02:35.44,000 --> 0:02:36,000
He would also supply me with tools.

58
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
He was this amazing encourager -- this patron, sort of, to make stuff.

59
0:02:42.76,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And he got me a Super 8 camera when I was 10 years old.

60
0:02:46.32,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And in 1976, that was sort of an anomaly,

61
0:02:48.84,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to be a 10-year-old kid that had access to a camera.

62
0:02:51.84,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And you know, he was so generous; I couldn't believe it.

63
0:02:55.48,000 --> 0:02:58,000
He wasn't doing it entirely without some manipulation.

64
0:02:58.96,000 --> 0:03:,000
I mean, I would call him, and I'd be like,

65
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:03,000
"Listen, Grandpa, I really need this camera.

66
0:03:03.56,000 --> 0:03:05,000
You don't understand. This is, like, I want to make movies.

67
0:03:06.36,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I'll get invited to TED one day --"

68
0:03:08.76,000 --> 0:03:09,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:09.8,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And, you know, my grandmother was the greatest.

70
0:03:12.04,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Because she'd be like, you know -- she'd get on the phone.

71
0:03:14.8,000 --> 0:03:17,000
She'd be like, "Harry, it's better than the drugs.

72
0:03:18.52,000 --> 0:03:19,000
She was fantastic.

73
0:03:20.508,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So I found myself getting this stuff, thanks to her assist,

74
0:03:23.76,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and suddenly, you know,

75
0:03:25.04,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I had a synthesizer when I was 14 years old --

76
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
this kind of stuff.

77
0:03:29.4,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And it let me make things, which, to me, was sort of the dream.

78
0:03:33.48,000 --> 0:03:36,000
He sort of humored my obsession to other things too, like magic.

79
0:03:37.04,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The thing is, we'd go to this magic store in New York City

80
0:03:39.8,000 --> 0:03:4,000
called Lou Tannen's Magic.

81
0:03:41.2,000 --> 0:03:42,000
It was this great magic store.

82
0:03:42.68,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It was a crappy little building in Midtown,

83
0:03:44.72,000 --> 0:03:46,000
but you'd be in the elevator, the elevator would open --

84
0:03:47.4,000 --> 0:03:49,000
there'd be this little, small magic store.

85
0:03:49.48,000 --> 0:03:51,000
You'd be in the magic store. And it was a magical place.

86
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So I got all these magic tricks. Here. I'll show you.

87
0:03:54.68,000 --> 0:03:56,000
This is the kind of thing. So it would be like, you know.

88
0:03:57.56,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Which is good, but now I can't move.

89
0:03:59.4,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Now, I have to do the rest of the thing like this.

90
0:04:01.84,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I'm like, "Oh, wow. Look at my computer over there!"

91
0:04:04.32,000 --> 0:04:06,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:06.56,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So one of the things that I bought at the magic store was this:

93
0:04:09.96,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Tannen's Mystery Magic Box.

94
0:04:11.76,000 --> 0:04:13,000
The premise behind the Mystery Magic Box was the following:

95
0:04:14.56,000 --> 0:04:17,000
15 dollars buys you 50 dollars worth of magic.

96
0:04:19.24,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Which is a savings.

97
0:04:20.48,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:22.36,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Now, I bought this decades ago and I'm not kidding.

99
0:04:24.8,000 --> 0:04:26,000
If you look at this, you'll see it's never been opened.

100
0:04:27.44,000 --> 0:04:29,000
But I've had this forever.

101
0:04:29.6,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Now, I was looking at this,

102
0:04:30.96,000 --> 0:04:32,000
it was in my office, as it always is, on the shelf,

103
0:04:33.4,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and I was thinking, why have I not opened this?

104
0:04:36.8,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And why have I kept it?

105
0:04:38.8,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Because I'm not a pack rat.

106
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I don't keep everything,

107
0:04:41.4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
but for some reason I haven't opened this box.

108
0:04:43.6,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And I felt like there was a key to this, somehow,

109
0:04:45.96,000 --> 0:04:48,000
in talking about something at TED that I haven't discussed before,

110
0:04:49.36,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and bored people elsewhere.

111
0:04:51.6,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So I thought, maybe there's something with this.

112
0:04:53.88,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And there was this giant question mark.

113
0:04:55.8,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I love the design, for what it's worth, of this thing.

114
0:04:58.36,000 --> 0:05:,000
And I started thinking, why haven't I opened it?

115
0:05:00.64,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And I realized that I haven't opened it

116
0:05:02.56,000 --> 0:05:04,000
because it represents something important -- to me.

117
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It represents my grandfather.

118
0:05:07.52,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Am I allowed to cry at TED?

119
0:05:08.92,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Because -- no, I'm not going to cry.

120
0:05:10.659,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Laughter)

121
0:05:11.84,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But --

122
0:05:13.015,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

123
0:05:16.76,000 --> 0:05:19,000
The thing is that it represents infinite possibility.

124
0:05:20.88,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It represents hope. It represents potential.

125
0:05:23.08,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And what I love about this box,

126
0:05:25.88,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and what I realize I sort of do in whatever it is that I do,

127
0:05:30.64,000 --> 0:05:34,000
is I find myself drawn to infinite possibility,

128
0:05:35.64,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that sense of potential.

129
0:05:36.88,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And I realize that mystery is the catalyst for imagination.

130
0:05:39.68,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Now, it's not the most ground-breaking idea,

131
0:05:41.8,000 --> 0:05:43,000
but when I started to think that maybe there are times

132
0:05:44.4,000 --> 0:05:46,000
when mystery is more important than knowledge.

133
0:05:46.6,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I started getting interested in this.

134
0:05:48.44,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And so I started thinking about "Lost" and the stuff that we do,

135
0:05:51.48,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and I realized, oh my God, mystery boxes are everywhere in what I do!

136
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:57,000
In the creation of "Lost," Damon Lindelof and I,

137
0:05:57.44,000 --> 0:05:58,000
who created the show with me,

138
0:05:58.88,000 --> 0:06:01,000
we were basically tasked with creating this series

139
0:06:02.04,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that we had very little time to do.

140
0:06:03.76,000 --> 0:06:04,000
We had 11 and a half weeks

141
0:06:05.28,000 --> 0:06:09,000
to write it, cast it, crew it, shoot it, cut it, post it, turn in a two-hour pilot.

142
0:06:10.08,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So it was not a lot of time.

143
0:06:11.48,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And that sense of possibility -- what could this thing be?

144
0:06:14.28,000 --> 0:06:15,000
There was no time to develop it.

145
0:06:15.88,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I'm sure you're all familiar with people

146
0:06:17.84,000 --> 0:06:19,000
who tell you what you can't do and what you should change.

147
0:06:20.6,000 --> 0:06:22,000
There was no time for that, which is kind of amazing.

148
0:06:23.12,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And so we did this show,

149
0:06:24.4,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and for those of you who haven't seen it, or don't know it,

150
0:06:27.2,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I can show you one little clip from the pilot,

151
0:06:29.56,000 --> 0:06:31,000
just to show you some stuff that we did.

152
0:06:31.8,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Engine roaring)

153
0:06:40.56,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Video) Claire: Help!

154
0:06:42.52,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Please help me!

155
0:06:44.72,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Help me! Please, help me!

156
0:06:48.76,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Jack: Get him out of here! Get him away from the engine!

157
0:06:51.56,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Get him out of here!

158
0:06:52.848,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Engine roaring)

159
0:06:58.96,000 --> 0:07:01,000
C: Help me, please! I'm having contractions!

160
0:07:02.32,000 --> 0:07:03,000
J: How many months pregnant are you?

161
0:07:04.08,000 --> 0:07:05,000
C: I'm only eight months.

162
0:07:05.56,000 --> 0:07:06,000
J: And how far apart are they coming?

163
0:07:07.4,000 --> 0:07:09,000
C: I don't know. I think it just happened.

164
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Man: Hey! Hey! Hey, get away from --

165
0:07:23.56,000 --> 0:07:25,000
JJ Abrams: 10 years ago, if we wanted to do that,

166
0:07:25.92,000 --> 0:07:26,000
we'd have to kill a stuntman.

167
0:07:27.36,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Laughter)

168
0:07:32.44,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It would be harder.

169
0:07:34.4,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Take two would be a bitch.

170
0:07:35.76,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Laughter)

171
0:07:37.04,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So the amazing thing was, we were able to do this thing.

172
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And part of that was the amazing availability of technology,

173
0:07:43.04,000 --> 0:07:44,000
knowing we could do anything.

174
0:07:44.48,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I mean, we could never have done that.

175
0:07:46.36,000 --> 0:07:47,000
We might have been able to write it;

176
0:07:48.12,000 --> 0:07:5,000
we wouldn't have been able to depict it like we did.

177
0:07:50.6,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So part of the amazing thing for me is in the creative process,

178
0:07:53.6,000 --> 0:07:55,000
technology is mind-blowingly inspiring to me.

179
0:07:55.76,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I realize that that blank page is a magic box, you know?

180
0:07:59.04,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It needs to be filled with something fantastic.

181
0:08:01.28,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I used to have the "Ordinary People" script that I'd flip through.

182
0:08:04.44,000 --> 0:08:06,000
The romance was amazing to me; it would inspire me.

183
0:08:06.88,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I wanted to try and fill pages

184
0:08:08.36,000 --> 0:08:11,000
with the same kind of spirit and thought and emotion

185
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that that script did.

186
0:08:13.4,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So, you know, I love Apple computers.

187
0:08:15.88,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I'm obsessed.

188
0:08:17.12,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So the Apple computer -- the PowerBook -- this computer,

189
0:08:19.84,000 --> 0:08:2,000
it challenges me.

190
0:08:21.08,000 --> 0:08:23,000
It basically says, what are you going to write worthy of me?

191
0:08:23.96,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I feel this -- I'm compelled.

192
0:08:25.68,000 --> 0:08:26,000
(Laughter)

193
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And I often am like, you know, dude, today I'm out.

194
0:08:29.44,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I got nothing. You know? So there's that.

195
0:08:31.6,000 --> 0:08:32,000
In terms of the content of it,

196
0:08:33.08,000 --> 0:08:36,000
you look at stories, you think, what are stories but mystery boxes?

197
0:08:36.28,000 --> 0:08:39,000
There's a fundamental question -- in TV, the first act is called the teaser.

198
0:08:39.92,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It's literally the teaser. It's the big question.

199
0:08:42.28,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So you're drawn into it. Then there's another question.

200
0:08:44.92,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And it goes on. Look at "Star Wars."

201
0:08:46.68,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The droids meet the mysterious woman.

202
0:08:48.52,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Who's that? We don't know. Mystery box! Then you meet Luke Skywalker.

203
0:08:51.8,000 --> 0:08:53,000
He gets the droid, you see the holographic image.

204
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
You learn it's a message. She wants to find Obi Wan Kenobi.

205
0:08:57,000 --> 0:08:59,000
He's her only hope. But who's Obi Wan Kenobi?

206
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
Mystery box! So then he meets Ben Kenobi.

207
0:09:01.137,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Ben Kenobi is Obi Wan Kenobi. Holy shit! So it keeps us --

208
0:09:03.88,000 --> 0:09:04,000
(Laughter)

209
0:09:04.92,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Have you guys not seen that?

210
0:09:06.32,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Laughter)

211
0:09:07.36,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It's huge! Anyway --

212
0:09:08.6,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So there's this thing with mystery boxes that I started feeling compelled.

213
0:09:14.2,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Then there's the thing of mystery in terms of imagination --

214
0:09:17.8,000 --> 0:09:19,000
the withholding of information.

215
0:09:20.32,000 --> 0:09:24,000
You know, doing that intentionally is much more engaging.

216
0:09:24.36,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Whether it's like the shark in "Jaws" --

217
0:09:26.32,000 --> 0:09:28,000
if Spielberg's mechanical shark, Bruce, had worked,

218
0:09:28.84,000 --> 0:09:31,000
it would not be remotely as scary; you would have seen it too much.

219
0:09:32.04,000 --> 0:09:34,000
In "Alien", they never really showed the alien: terrifying!

220
0:09:34.88,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Even in a movie like a romantic comedy, "The Graduate,"

221
0:09:38.04,000 --> 0:09:4,000
they're having that date, and they're in the car,

222
0:09:40.4,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and it's loud, and so they put the top up.

223
0:09:42.68,000 --> 0:09:43,000
You don't hear anything they're saying!

224
0:09:44.6,000 --> 0:09:46,000
You can't hear a word! But it's the most romantic date ever.

225
0:09:47.48,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And you love it because you don't hear it.

226
0:09:49.56,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So to me, there's that. And then, finally, there's this idea --

227
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
stretching the paradigm a little bit --

228
0:09:55.44,000 --> 0:09:57,000
but the idea of the mystery box.

229
0:09:57.72,000 --> 0:10:,000
Meaning, what you think you're getting, then what you're really getting.

230
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And it's true in so many movies and stories.

231
0:10:03.28,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Look at "E.T.," for example --

232
0:10:04.76,000 --> 0:10:06,000
"E.T." is this unbelievable movie about what?

233
0:10:06.92,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It's about an alien who meets a kid, right?

234
0:10:08.96,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Well, it's not. "E.T." is about divorce.

235
0:10:10.92,000 --> 0:10:12,000
"E.T." is about a heartbroken, divorce-crippled family,

236
0:10:13.56,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and ultimately, this kid who can't find his way.

237
0:10:15.84,000 --> 0:10:18,000
"Die Hard," right? Crazy, great, fun, action-adventure movie in a building.

238
0:10:19.4,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It's about a guy who's on the verge of divorce.

239
0:10:21.64,000 --> 0:10:23,000
He's showing up to L.A., tail between his legs.

240
0:10:23.88,000 --> 0:10:24,000
There are great scenes --

241
0:10:25.12,000 --> 0:10:28,000
maybe not the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time,

242
0:10:28.28,000 --> 0:10:29,000
but pretty great scenes.

243
0:10:29.52,000 --> 0:10:31,000
There's a half an hour of investment in character

244
0:10:31.88,000 --> 0:10:33,000
before you get to the stuff that you're expecting.

245
0:10:34.28,000 --> 0:10:35,000
When you look at a movie like "Jaws,"

246
0:10:36.12,000 --> 0:10:38,000
the scene that you expect -- we have the screen?

247
0:10:38.4,000 --> 0:10:39,000
These are the kind of scenes

248
0:10:39.8,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that you remember and expect from "Jaws."

249
0:10:42.28,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And she's being eaten;

250
0:10:44.4,000 --> 0:10:45,000
there's a shark.

251
0:10:45.72,000 --> 0:10:46,000
(Woman screaming)

252
0:10:46.96,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The thing about "Jaws" is, it's really about a guy

253
0:10:49.36,000 --> 0:10:52,000
who is sort of dealing with his place in the world -- with his masculinity,

254
0:10:52.92,000 --> 0:10:55,000
with his family, how he's going to, you know, make it work in this new town.

255
0:10:56.52,000 --> 0:10:57,000
This is one of my favorite scenes ever,

256
0:10:58.44,000 --> 0:11:,000
and this is a scene that you wouldn't necessarily think of

257
0:11:01.2,000 --> 0:11:03,000
when you think of "Jaws." But it's an amazing scene.

258
0:11:58.8,000 --> 0:11:59,000
(Video) Father: C'mere.

259
0:12:03.6,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Give us a kiss.

260
0:12:05.56,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Son: Why?

261
0:12:08.84,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Father: 'Cause I need it.

262
0:12:10.88,000 --> 0:12:11,000
JJA: Come on. "Why? 'Cause I need it"?

263
0:12:12.714,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Best scene ever, right?

264
0:12:13.98,000 --> 0:12:14,000
(Laughter)

265
0:12:15.02,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Come on! So you think of "Jaws" --

266
0:12:16.84,000 --> 0:12:17,000
so that's the kind of stuff that,

267
0:12:18.48,000 --> 0:12:2,000
like, you know -- the investment of character,

268
0:12:21.44,000 --> 0:12:23,000
which is the stuff that really is inside the box, you know?

269
0:12:24.24,000 --> 0:12:27,000
It's why when people do sequels, or rip off movies, you know, of a genre,

270
0:12:27.72,000 --> 0:12:28,000
they're ripping off the wrong thing.

271
0:12:29.48,000 --> 0:12:31,000
You're not supposed to rip off the shark or the monster.

272
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
You know, if you rip something off -- rip off the character.

273
0:12:35.04,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Rip off the stuff that matters.

274
0:12:36.6,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I mean, look inside yourself and figure out what is inside you.

275
0:12:39.6,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Because ultimately, the mystery box is all of us.

276
0:12:42.08,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So there's that. Then the distribution.

277
0:12:43.962,000 --> 0:12:45,000
What's a bigger mystery box than a movie theater? You know?

278
0:12:46.8,000 --> 0:12:48,000
You go to the theater, you're just so excited to see anything.

279
0:12:49.76,000 --> 0:12:51,000
The moment the lights go down is often the best part.

280
0:12:52.28,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And you're full of that amazing -- that feeling of excited anticipation.

281
0:12:56.76,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And often, the movie's there and it's going,

282
0:12:58.88,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and then something happens and you go, "Oh --", and then, "Mmm ..."

283
0:13:02.08,000 --> 0:13:04,000
When it's a great movie, you're along for the ride

284
0:13:04.48,000 --> 0:13:06,000
because you're willing to give yourself to it.

285
0:13:06.647,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So to me, whether it's a TV, an iPod, computer, cell phone --

286
0:13:10.48,000 --> 0:13:12,000
It's funny, I'm an -- as I said, Apple fanatic --

287
0:13:12.84,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and one day, about a year or so ago,

288
0:13:14.6,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I was signing on online in the morning to watch Steve Jobs' keynote,

289
0:13:18.32,000 --> 0:13:19,000
because I always do.

290
0:13:19.56,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And he came on, he was presenting the video iPod,

291
0:13:22.72,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and what was on the enormous iPod behind him?

292
0:13:25.52,000 --> 0:13:27,000
"Lost"! I had no idea!

293
0:13:27.84,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And I realized, holy shit, it'd come full circle.

294
0:13:30.2,000 --> 0:13:31,000
The inspiration I get from the technology

295
0:13:32.177,000 --> 0:13:34,000
is now using the stuff that I do to sell technology. It's nuts!

296
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
(Laughter)

297
0:13:36.4,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I was going to show you a couple of other things I'm going to skip.

298
0:13:39.68,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I'll show you one other thing that has nothing to do with anything.

299
0:13:42.88,000 --> 0:13:44,000
This is something online; six years ago, they did this.

300
0:13:45.54,000 --> 0:13:48,000
This is an online thing done by guys who had some visual effects experience.

301
0:13:49.14,000 --> 0:13:51,000
But the point was, that they were doing things

302
0:13:51.34,000 --> 0:13:54,000
that were using these mystery boxes that they had -- everyone has now.

303
0:13:54.66,000 --> 0:13:57,000
What I've realized is what my grandfather did for me when I was a kid,

304
0:13:58.02,000 --> 0:13:59,000
everyone has access to now.

305
0:13:59.84,000 --> 0:14:01,000
You don't need to have my grandfather, though you wish you had.

306
0:14:02.84,000 --> 0:14:03,000
But I have to tell you --

307
0:14:04.12,000 --> 0:14:06,000
this is a guy doing stuff on a Quadra 950 computer --

308
0:14:06.64,000 --> 0:14:07,000
the resolution's a little bit low --

309
0:14:08.4,000 --> 0:14:1,000
using Infinity software they stopped making 15 years ago.

310
0:14:11.12,000 --> 0:14:12,000
He's doing stuff that looks as amazing

311
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:16,000
as stuff I've seen released from Hollywood.

312
0:14:16.2,000 --> 0:14:18,000
The most incredible sort of mystery, I think,

313
0:14:19.2,000 --> 0:14:21,000
is now the question of what comes next.

314
0:14:21.96,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Because it is now democratized.

315
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:26,000
So now, the creation of media -- it's everywhere.

316
0:14:26.52,000 --> 0:14:29,000
The stuff that I was lucky and begging for to get when I was a kid

317
0:14:30.36,000 --> 0:14:31,000
is now ubiquitous.

318
0:14:31.6,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And so, there's an amazing sense of opportunity out there.

319
0:14:34.44,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And when I think of the filmmakers who exist out there now

320
0:14:37.56,000 --> 0:14:38,000
who would have been silenced, you know --

321
0:14:39.56,000 --> 0:14:41,000
who have been silenced in the past --

322
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:43,000
it's a very exciting thing.

323
0:14:43.36,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I used to say in classes and lectures and stuff,

324
0:14:46.52,000 --> 0:14:48,000
to someone who wants to write, "Go! Write! Do your thing."

325
0:14:49.28,000 --> 0:14:5,000
It's free, you don't need permission.

326
0:14:51.08,000 --> 0:14:54,000
But now I can say, "Go make your movie!" There's nothing stopping you

327
0:14:54.36,000 --> 0:14:56,000
from going out there and getting the technology.

328
0:14:56.64,000 --> 0:14:58,000
You can lease, rent, buy stuff off the shelf

329
0:14:59.08,000 --> 0:15:02,000
that is either as good, or just as good,

330
0:15:02.88,000 --> 0:15:05,000
as the stuff that's being used by the, you know, "legit people."

331
0:15:06.44,000 --> 0:15:1,000
No community is best served when only the elite have control.

332
0:15:10.6,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And I feel like this is an amazing opportunity

333
0:15:12.8,000 --> 0:15:13,000
to see what else is out there.

334
0:15:14.28,000 --> 0:15:17,000
When I did "Mission: Impossible III," we had amazing visual effects.

335
0:15:17.52,000 --> 0:15:18,000
ILM did the effects; it was incredible.

336
0:15:19.44,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And sort of my dream to be involved.

337
0:15:21.2,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And there are a couple of sequences in the movie,

338
0:15:23.56,000 --> 0:15:25,000
like these couple of moments I'll show you.

339
0:15:30.68,000 --> 0:15:31,000
There's that.

340
0:15:38.64,000 --> 0:15:39,000
(Video) Luther: Ethan, move!

341
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:46,000
(Explosion)

342
0:15:52.68,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Obviously, I have an obsession with big crazy explosions.

343
0:15:55.56,000 --> 0:15:58,000
So my favorite visual effect in the movie is the one I'm about to show you.

344
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
It's a scene in which Tom's character wakes up.

345
0:16:01.4,000 --> 0:16:02,000
He's drowsy. He's crazy.

346
0:16:02.68,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And the guy wakes up, and he shoves this gun in his nose

347
0:16:05.36,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and shoots this little capsule into his brain

348
0:16:07.52,000 --> 0:16:09,000
that he's going to use later to kill him, as bad guys do.

349
0:16:16.4,000 --> 0:16:17,000
(Video) Brownway: Good morning.

350
0:16:19.84,000 --> 0:16:2,000
JJA: OK, now.

351
0:16:21.12,000 --> 0:16:22,000
When we shot that scene,

352
0:16:22.36,000 --> 0:16:25,000
the actor who had the gun, an English actor, Eddie Marsan --

353
0:16:25.44,000 --> 0:16:26,000
sweetheart, great guy --

354
0:16:26.68,000 --> 0:16:28,000
he kept taking the gun and putting it into Tom's nose,

355
0:16:29.28,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and it was hurting Tom's nose.

356
0:16:30.8,000 --> 0:16:32,000
And I learned this very early on in my career:

357
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Don't hurt Tom's nose.

358
0:16:34.28,000 --> 0:16:35,000
(Laughter)

359
0:16:36.2,000 --> 0:16:38,000
There are three things you don't want to do.

360
0:16:38.32,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Number two is: Don't hurt Tom's nose.

361
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
So Eddie has this gun -- and he's this sweet English guy.

362
0:16:42.88,000 --> 0:16:44,000
He's like, "Sorry, I don't want to hurt you."

363
0:16:45.04,000 --> 0:16:47,000
I'm like, "We have to make this look good."

364
0:16:47.08,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And I realized that we had to do something because it wasn't working.

365
0:16:50.343,000 --> 0:16:52,000
And I thought back to what I would have done

366
0:16:52.6,000 --> 0:16:54,000
using the Super 8 camera that my grandfather got me

367
0:16:55.04,000 --> 0:16:56,000
sitting in that room,

368
0:16:56.28,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and I realized that hand didn't have to be Eddie Marsan's.

369
0:16:59.04,000 --> 0:17:,000
It could be Tom's.

370
0:17:00.28,000 --> 0:17:02,000
And Tom would know just how hard to push the gun.

371
0:17:02.64,000 --> 0:17:03,000
He wouldn't hurt himself.

372
0:17:03.88,000 --> 0:17:06,000
So we took his hand and we painted it to look a little bit more like Eddie's.

373
0:17:07.56,000 --> 0:17:08,000
We put it in Eddie's sleeve,

374
0:17:09.44,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and so the hand that you see --

375
0:17:10.96,000 --> 0:17:13,000
that's not Eddie's hand, that's Tom's. So Tom is playing two roles.

376
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
(Laughter)

377
0:17:15.6,000 --> 0:17:16,000
And he didn't ask for any more money.

378
0:17:17.44,000 --> 0:17:18,000
So here, here. Watch it again.

379
0:17:19.999,000 --> 0:17:2,000
There he is. He's waking up.

380
0:17:21.519,000 --> 0:17:23,000
He's drowsy, been through a lot.

381
0:17:27.56,000 --> 0:17:28,000
(Video) Brownway: Good morning.

382
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
JJA: Tom's hand. Tom's hand. Tom's hand.

383
0:17:31.32,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Anyway.

384
0:17:32.56,000 --> 0:17:33,000
So ...

385
0:17:33.8,000 --> 0:17:36,000
(Applause)

386
0:17:37.2,000 --> 0:17:38,000
Thanks.

387
0:17:38.44,000 --> 0:17:4,000
(Applause)

388
0:17:40.519,000 --> 0:17:44,000
So you don't need the greatest technology to do things that can work in movies.

389
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
And the mystery box, in honor of my grandfather, stays closed.

390
0:17:48.52,000 --> 0:17:49,000
Thank you.

391
0:17:49.76,000 --> 0:17:52,000
(Applause)

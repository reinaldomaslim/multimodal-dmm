1
0:00:12.82,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I want us to start by thinking about this device,

2
0:00:15.93,000 --> 0:00:18,000
the phone that's very likely in your pockets right now.

3
0:00:19.563,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Over 40 percent of Americans check their phones

4
0:00:22.704,000 --> 0:00:25,000
within five minutes of waking up every morning.

5
0:00:25.958,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And then they look at it another 50 times during the day.

6
0:00:29.707,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Grownups consider this device to be a necessity.

7
0:00:34.71,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But now I want you to imagine it in the hands of a three-year-old,

8
0:00:39.66,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and as a society, we get anxious.

9
0:00:42.934,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Parents are very worried

10
0:00:44.186,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that this device is going to stunt their children's social growth;

11
0:00:47.69,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that it's going to keep them from getting up and moving;

12
0:00:50.379,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that somehow,

13
0:00:51.775,000 --> 0:00:53,000
this is going to disrupt childhood.

14
0:00:56.102,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So, I want to challenge this attitude.

15
0:01:00.224,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I can envision a future

16
0:01:02.319,000 --> 0:01:06,000
where we would be excited to see a preschooler interacting with a screen.

17
0:01:08.347,000 --> 0:01:12,000
These screens can get kids up and moving even more.

18
0:01:13.909,000 --> 0:01:16,000
They have the power to tell us more about what a child is learning

19
0:01:17.088,000 --> 0:01:18,000
than a standardized test can.

20
0:01:18.959,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And here's the really crazy thought:

21
0:01:20.939,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I believe that these screens have the power

22
0:01:23.772,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to prompt more real-life conversations

23
0:01:26.505,000 --> 0:01:28,000
between kids and their parents.

24
0:01:30.302,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Now, I was perhaps an unlikely champion for this cause.

25
0:01:33.612,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I studied children's literature

26
0:01:35.597,000 --> 0:01:37,000
because I was going to work with kids and books.

27
0:01:38.654,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But about 20 years ago,

28
0:01:40.779,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I had an experience that shifted my focus.

29
0:01:44.788,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I was helping lead a research study about preschoolers and websites.

30
0:01:49.01,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And I walked in and was assigned a three-year-old named Maria.

31
0:01:52.793,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Maria had actually never seen a computer before.

32
0:01:56.712,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So the first thing I had to do was teach her how to use the mouse,

33
0:01:59.882,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and when I opened up the screen, she moved it across the screen,

34
0:02:05.336,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and she stopped on a character named X the Owl.

35
0:02:09.103,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And when she did that,

36
0:02:10.373,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the owl lifted his wing and waved at her.

37
0:02:14.189,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Maria dropped the mouse, pushed back from the table, leaped up

38
0:02:17.586,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and started waving frantically back at him.

39
0:02:21.814,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Her connection to that character

40
0:02:24.09,000 --> 0:02:25,000
was visceral.

41
0:02:25.384,000 --> 0:02:27,000
This wasn't a passive screen experience.

42
0:02:28.948,000 --> 0:02:3,000
This was a human experience.

43
0:02:32.176,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And it was exactly appropriate for a three-year-old.

44
0:02:36.82,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I've now worked at PBS Kids for more than 15 years,

45
0:02:40.819,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and my work there is focused on harnessing the power of technology

46
0:02:45.464,000 --> 0:02:47,000
as a positive in children's lives.

47
0:02:48.15,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I believe that as a society, we're missing a big opportunity.

48
0:02:51.636,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We're letting our fear and our skepticism

49
0:02:53.903,000 --> 0:02:54,000
about these devices

50
0:02:55.36,000 --> 0:02:57,000
hold us back from realizing their potential

51
0:02:57.896,000 --> 0:02:58,000
in our children's lives.

52
0:03:00.49,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Fear about kids and technology is nothing new;

53
0:03:03.73,000 --> 0:03:04,000
we've been here before.

54
0:03:05.388,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Over 50 years ago, the debate was raging about the newly dominant media:

55
0:03:10.129,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the television.

56
0:03:11.828,000 --> 0:03:13,000
That box in the living room?

57
0:03:13.852,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It might be separating kids from one another.

58
0:03:16.522,000 --> 0:03:18,000
It might keep them away from the outside world.

59
0:03:20.344,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But this is the moment when Fred Rogers,

60
0:03:23.41,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the long-running host of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,"

61
0:03:26.517,000 --> 0:03:3,000
challenged society to look at television as a tool,

62
0:03:31.271,000 --> 0:03:33,000
a tool that could promote emotional growth.

63
0:03:34.014,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Here's what he did:

64
0:03:35.221,000 --> 0:03:38,000
he looked out from the screen, and he held a conversation,

65
0:03:39.617,000 --> 0:03:43,000
as if he were speaking to each child individually

66
0:03:43.887,000 --> 0:03:44,000
about feelings.

67
0:03:45.653,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And then he would pause

68
0:03:47.883,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and let them think about them.

69
0:03:51.091,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You can see his influence across the media landscape today,

70
0:03:54.783,000 --> 0:03:56,000
but at the time, this was revolutionary.

71
0:03:58.341,000 --> 0:04:02,000
He shifted the way we looked at television in the lives of children.

72
0:04:04.923,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Today it's not just one box.

73
0:04:07.594,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Kids are surrounded by devices.

74
0:04:10.137,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And I'm also a parent -- I understand this feeling of anxiety.

75
0:04:15.769,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But I want us to look at three common fears

76
0:04:18.929,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that parents have,

77
0:04:20.466,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and see if we can shift our focus

78
0:04:23.334,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to the opportunity that's in each of them.

79
0:04:26.691,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So.

80
0:04:27.868,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Fear number one:

81
0:04:29.77,000 --> 0:04:3,000
"Screens are passive.

82
0:04:31.452,000 --> 0:04:34,000
This is going to keep our kids from getting up and moving."

83
0:04:35.725,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Chris Kratt and Martin Kratt are zoologist brothers

84
0:04:39.252,000 --> 0:04:41,000
who host a show about animals called "Wild Kratts."

85
0:04:42.707,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And they approached the PBS team to say,

86
0:04:45.094,000 --> 0:04:47,000
"Can we do something with those cameras

87
0:04:47.281,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that are built into every device now?

88
0:04:49.606,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Could those cameras capture a very natural kid play pattern --

89
0:04:54.315,000 --> 0:04:56,000
pretending to be animals?"

90
0:04:57.084,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So we started with bats.

91
0:05:00.361,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And when kids came in to play this game,

92
0:05:02.527,000 --> 0:05:04,000
they loved seeing themselves on-screen with wings.

93
0:05:06.066,000 --> 0:05:07,000
But my favorite part of this,

94
0:05:07.733,000 --> 0:05:1,000
when the game was over and we turned off the screens?

95
0:05:11.049,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The kids kept being bats.

96
0:05:12.986,000 --> 0:05:13,000
They kept flying around the room,

97
0:05:14.947,000 --> 0:05:17,000
they kept veering left and right to catch mosquitoes.

98
0:05:18.556,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And they remembered things.

99
0:05:20.991,000 --> 0:05:22,000
They remembered that bats fly at night.

100
0:05:24.421,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And they remembered that when bats sleep,

101
0:05:26.773,000 --> 0:05:28,000
they hang upside down and fold their wings in.

102
0:05:30.441,000 --> 0:05:32,000
This game definitely got kids up and moving.

103
0:05:33.669,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But also, now when kids go outside,

104
0:05:36.883,000 --> 0:05:38,000
do they look at a bird and think,

105
0:05:39.104,000 --> 0:05:41,000
"How does a bird fly differently than I flew

106
0:05:41.868,000 --> 0:05:42,000
when I was a bat?"

107
0:05:44.447,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The digital technology prompted embodied learning

108
0:05:47.774,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that kids can now take out into the world.

109
0:05:52.181,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Fear number two:

110
0:05:55.747,000 --> 0:05:58,000
"Playing games on these screens is just a waste of time.

111
0:05:58.843,000 --> 0:06:,000
It's going to distract children from their education."

112
0:06:03.827,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Game developers know

113
0:06:05.252,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that you can learn a lot about a player's skill

114
0:06:07.686,000 --> 0:06:09,000
by looking at the back-end data:

115
0:06:09.788,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Where did a player pause?

116
0:06:12.126,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Where did they make a few mistakes before they found the right answer?

117
0:06:15.796,000 --> 0:06:19,000
My team wanted to take that tool set and apply it to academic learning.

118
0:06:21.234,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Our producer in Boston, WGBH,

119
0:06:24.259,000 --> 0:06:26,000
created a series of Curious George games

120
0:06:27.006,000 --> 0:06:28,000
focused on math.

121
0:06:29.428,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And researchers came in and had 80 preschoolers play these games.

122
0:06:35.235,000 --> 0:06:37,000
They then gave all 80 of those preschoolers

123
0:06:37.823,000 --> 0:06:38,000
a standardized math test.

124
0:06:40.433,000 --> 0:06:41,000
We could see early on

125
0:06:41.628,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that these games were actually helping kids

126
0:06:43.78,000 --> 0:06:45,000
understand some key skills.

127
0:06:46.208,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But our partners at UCLA wanted us to dig deeper.

128
0:06:50.164,000 --> 0:06:53,000
They focus on data analysis and student assessment.

129
0:06:54.219,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And they wanted to take that back-end game-play data

130
0:06:57.691,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and see if they could use it to predict a child's math scores.

131
0:07:01.888,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So they made a neural net -- they essentially trained the computer

132
0:07:05.562,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to use this data,

133
0:07:07.108,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and here are the results.

134
0:07:08.632,000 --> 0:07:11,000
This is a subset of the children's standardized math scores.

135
0:07:13.244,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And this

136
0:07:15.279,000 --> 0:07:18,000
is the computer's prediction of each child's score,

137
0:07:18.96,000 --> 0:07:21,000
based on playing some Curious George games.

138
0:07:23.508,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The prediction is astonishingly accurate,

139
0:07:25.942,000 --> 0:07:28,000
especially considering the fact that these games weren't built

140
0:07:28.978,000 --> 0:07:29,000
for assessment.

141
0:07:30.721,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The team that did this study believes that games like these

142
0:07:33.713,000 --> 0:07:36,000
can teach us more about a child's cognitive learning

143
0:07:37.422,000 --> 0:07:39,000
than a standardized test can.

144
0:07:40.62,000 --> 0:07:44,000
What if games could reduce testing time in the classroom?

145
0:07:44.819,000 --> 0:07:46,000
What if they could reduce testing anxiety?

146
0:07:48.42,000 --> 0:07:51,000
How could they give teachers snapshots of insight

147
0:07:51.869,000 --> 0:07:54,000
to help them better focus their individualized learning?

148
0:07:57.967,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So the third fear I want to address

149
0:08:00.896,000 --> 0:08:02,000
is the one that I think is often the biggest.

150
0:08:03.904,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And that's this:

151
0:08:05.911,000 --> 0:08:08,000
"These screens are isolating me from my child."

152
0:08:10.831,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Let's play out a scenario.

153
0:08:12.966,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Let's say that you are a parent,

154
0:08:15.703,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and you need 25 minutes of uninterrupted time

155
0:08:18.725,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to get dinner ready.

156
0:08:20.307,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And in order to do that, you hand a tablet to your three-year-old.

157
0:08:23.99,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Now, this is a moment where you probably feel very guilty

158
0:08:26.991,000 --> 0:08:27,000
about what you just did.

159
0:08:29.565,000 --> 0:08:31,000
But now imagine this:

160
0:08:31.589,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Twenty minutes later, you receive a text message.

161
0:08:34.663,000 --> 0:08:36,000
on that cell phone that's always within arm's reach.

162
0:08:37.661,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And it says: "Alex just matched five rhyming words.

163
0:08:42.223,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Ask him to play this game with you.

164
0:08:44.09,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Can you think of a word that rhymes with 'cat'?

165
0:08:47.763,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Or how about 'ball'?"

166
0:08:50.617,000 --> 0:08:53,000
In our studies, when parents receive simple tips like these,

167
0:08:54.368,000 --> 0:08:55,000
they felt empowered.

168
0:08:56.037,000 --> 0:08:57,000
They were so excited

169
0:08:57.671,000 --> 0:08:59,000
to play these games at the dinner table with their kids.

170
0:09:00.319,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And the kids loved it, too.

171
0:09:01.945,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Not only did it feel like magic that their parents knew

172
0:09:04.884,000 --> 0:09:05,000
what they had been playing,

173
0:09:06.471,000 --> 0:09:09,000
kids love to play games with their parents.

174
0:09:10.996,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Just the act of talking to kids about their media

175
0:09:14.951,000 --> 0:09:16,000
can be incredibly powerful.

176
0:09:17.649,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Last summer, Texas Tech University published a study

177
0:09:20.998,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that the show "Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood" could promote

178
0:09:24.384,000 --> 0:09:27,000
the development of empathy among children.

179
0:09:27.8,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But there was a really important catch to this study:

180
0:09:30.623,000 --> 0:09:34,000
the greatest benefit was only when parents talked to kids

181
0:09:35.104,000 --> 0:09:36,000
about what they watched.

182
0:09:37.014,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Neither just watching

183
0:09:39.038,000 --> 0:09:41,000
nor just talking about it was enough;

184
0:09:41.062,000 --> 0:09:43,000
it was the combination that was key.

185
0:09:45.034,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So when I read this study,

186
0:09:46.511,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I started thinking about

187
0:09:47.939,000 --> 0:09:52,000
how rarely parents of preschoolers actually talk to kids about the content

188
0:09:53.216,000 --> 0:09:55,000
of what they're playing and what they're watching.

189
0:09:55.626,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And so I decided to try it with my four-year-old.

190
0:09:58.113,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I said,

191
0:09:59.897,000 --> 0:10:01,000
"Were you playing a car game earlier today?"

192
0:10:03.172,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And Benjamin perked up and said,

193
0:10:05.178,000 --> 0:10:08,000
"Yes! And did you see that I made my car out of a pickle?

194
0:10:09.047,000 --> 0:10:11,000
It was really hard to open the trunk."

195
0:10:11.158,000 --> 0:10:12,000
(Laughter)

196
0:10:12.84,000 --> 0:10:16,000
This hilarious conversation about what was fun in the game

197
0:10:16.949,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and what could have been better

198
0:10:18.484,000 --> 0:10:2,000
continued all the way to school that morning.

199
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I'm not here to suggest to you that all digital media is great for kids.

200
0:10:29.759,000 --> 0:10:31,000
There are legitimate reasons for us to be concerned

201
0:10:32.469,000 --> 0:10:34,000
about the current state of children's content

202
0:10:34.952,000 --> 0:10:35,000
on these screens.

203
0:10:36.882,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And it's right for us to be thinking about balance:

204
0:10:39.681,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Where do screens fit against all the other things

205
0:10:43.365,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that a child needs to do to learn and to grow?

206
0:10:48.078,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But when we fixate on our fears about it,

207
0:10:50.909,000 --> 0:10:52,000
we forget a really major point,

208
0:10:53.717,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and that is, that kids are living in the same world that we live in,

209
0:10:57.939,000 --> 0:10:59,000
the world where the grownups check their phones

210
0:11:00.648,000 --> 0:11:01,000
more than 50 times a day.

211
0:11:03.706,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Screens are a part of children's lives.

212
0:11:07.868,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And if we pretend that they aren't,

213
0:11:10.892,000 --> 0:11:12,000
or if we get overwhelmed by our fear,

214
0:11:13.911,000 --> 0:11:17,000
kids are never going to learn how and why to use them.

215
0:11:19.725,000 --> 0:11:22,000
What if we start raising our expectations

216
0:11:23.014,000 --> 0:11:24,000
for this media?

217
0:11:24.945,000 --> 0:11:26,000
What if we start talking to kids regularly

218
0:11:27.242,000 --> 0:11:29,000
about the content on these screens?

219
0:11:29.911,000 --> 0:11:31,000
What if we start looking for the positive impacts

220
0:11:33.494,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that this technology can have in our children's lives?

221
0:11:38.042,000 --> 0:11:42,000
That's when the potential of these tools can become a reality.

222
0:11:43.164,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Thank you.

223
0:11:44.383,000 --> 0:11:47,000
(Applause)

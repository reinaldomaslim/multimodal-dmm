1
0:00:12.952,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Let's put the care back into health care.

2
0:00:16.69,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I've been working in the healthcare sector for the last 15 years,

3
0:00:20.535,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and one of the things that drew me to this sector

4
0:00:22.936,000 --> 0:00:26,000
was my interest in the care component of our healthcare systems --

5
0:00:27.178,000 --> 0:00:28,000
more specifically,

6
0:00:28.541,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to the invaluable role played by carers.

7
0:00:32.173,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Now, how many of you in this room consider yourself a carer?

8
0:00:38.473,000 --> 0:00:4,000
By this, I mean how many of you have cared for someone

9
0:00:41.096,000 --> 0:00:44,000
suffering from an illness, injury or disability?

10
0:00:44.747,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Can you raise your hand if this is the case?

11
0:00:49.119,000 --> 0:00:5,000
About half of the room.

12
0:00:51.316,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I want to thank all of you who raised your hands

13
0:00:53.65,000 --> 0:00:55,000
for the time that you've spent as a carer.

14
0:00:55.838,000 --> 0:00:57,000
What you do is extremely precious.

15
0:00:59.813,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I am a former cared-for patient myself.

16
0:01:02.868,000 --> 0:01:05,000
When I was a teenager, I suffered from Lyme disease

17
0:01:05.985,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and underwent 18 months of antibiotic treatment.

18
0:01:10.025,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I was repeatedly misdiagnosed:

19
0:01:12.521,000 --> 0:01:16,000
bacterial meningitis, fibromyalgia, you name it.

20
0:01:16.988,000 --> 0:01:17,000
They couldn't figure it out.

21
0:01:19.141,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And if I'm standing here in front of you today,

22
0:01:22.63,000 --> 0:01:23,000
it's because I owe my life

23
0:01:24.283,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to the stubbornness and commitment of one carer.

24
0:01:28.187,000 --> 0:01:29,000
He did everything he could for me --

25
0:01:30.179,000 --> 0:01:33,000
driving long distances from one treatment center to another,

26
0:01:33.675,000 --> 0:01:34,000
searching for the best option,

27
0:01:36.276,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and above all, never giving up,

28
0:01:39.032,000 --> 0:01:4,000
despite the difficulties he encountered,

29
0:01:41.04,000 --> 0:01:44,000
including from a work and quality-of-life perspective.

30
0:01:44.867,000 --> 0:01:45,000
That was my father.

31
0:01:46.629,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I recovered, and this is largely thanks to his dedication.

32
0:01:51.631,000 --> 0:01:54,000
This experience turned me into a patient advocate.

33
0:01:55.478,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The closer I looked, the more I saw carers providing the same kind of support

34
0:02:00.284,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that my father provided to me,

35
0:02:02.618,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and playing a crucial role in the healthcare system.

36
0:02:06.686,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I don't think it's an exaggeration to say

37
0:02:09.331,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that without informal carers like him,

38
0:02:11.835,000 --> 0:02:13,000
our health and social systems

39
0:02:14.051,000 --> 0:02:15,000
would crumble.

40
0:02:16.148,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And yet, they're largely going unrecognized.

41
0:02:20.828,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I am now a long-distance carer for my mother,

42
0:02:24.687,000 --> 0:02:26,000
who suffers from multiple chronic conditions.

43
0:02:28.004,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I understand, now more than ever,

44
0:02:31.811,000 --> 0:02:33,000
the demands that caregivers face.

45
0:02:34.942,000 --> 0:02:36,000
With aging populations,

46
0:02:37.15,000 --> 0:02:38,000
economic instability,

47
0:02:38.999,000 --> 0:02:39,000
healthcare system stress

48
0:02:40.995,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and increased incidents of long-term chronic care needs,

49
0:02:44.69,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the importance and demands on family caregivers

50
0:02:47.432,000 --> 0:02:48,000
are greater than ever.

51
0:02:49.886,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Carers all over the world are sacrificing their own physical,

52
0:02:53.801,000 --> 0:02:55,000
financial and psychosocial well-being

53
0:02:56.611,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to provide care for their loved ones.

54
0:02:59.556,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Carers have their own limits and needs,

55
0:03:01.98,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and in absence of adequate support,

56
0:03:04.398,000 --> 0:03:06,000
many could be stretched to the breaking point.

57
0:03:07.858,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Once seen as a personal and private matter in family life,

58
0:03:12.132,000 --> 0:03:15,000
unpaid caregiving has formed the invisible backbone

59
0:03:15.667,000 --> 0:03:18,000
of our health and social systems all over the world.

60
0:03:20.469,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Many of these carers are even in this room,

61
0:03:22.887,000 --> 0:03:23,000
as we have just seen.

62
0:03:25.031,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Who are they, and how many are they?

63
0:03:28.217,000 --> 0:03:3,000
What are the challenges that they are facing?

64
0:03:30.607,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And, above all, how can we make sure that their value to patients,

65
0:03:34.43,000 --> 0:03:36,000
our healthcare system and society

66
0:03:36.772,000 --> 0:03:37,000
is recognized?

67
0:03:39.067,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Anyone can be a carer, really:

68
0:03:42.357,000 --> 0:03:45,000
a 15-year-old girl caring for a parent with multiple sclerosis;

69
0:03:47.074,000 --> 0:03:49,000
a 40-year-old man juggling full-time work

70
0:03:50.002,000 --> 0:03:52,000
while caring for his family who lives far away;

71
0:03:53.623,000 --> 0:03:56,000
a 60-year-old man caring for his wife who has terminal cancer;

72
0:03:58.279,000 --> 0:04:01,000
or an 80-year-old woman caring for her husband

73
0:04:01.438,000 --> 0:04:02,000
who has Alzheimer's disease.

74
0:04:03.997,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The things carers do for their patients are varied.

75
0:04:07.913,000 --> 0:04:08,000
They provide personal care,

76
0:04:09.633,000 --> 0:04:11,000
like getting someone dressed,

77
0:04:11.665,000 --> 0:04:12,000
feeding them,

78
0:04:13.234,000 --> 0:04:14,000
helping them to the bathroom,

79
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
helping them move about.

80
0:04:17.356,000 --> 0:04:2,000
They also provide a significant level of medical care,

81
0:04:20.991,000 --> 0:04:24,000
because they often know a lot about their loved one's condition and needs,

82
0:04:25.962,000 --> 0:04:27,000
sometimes better than the patients themselves,

83
0:04:28.875,000 --> 0:04:31,000
who may be paralyzed or confused by their diagnosis.

84
0:04:33.284,000 --> 0:04:34,000
In those situations,

85
0:04:35.35,000 --> 0:04:38,000
carers are also advocates for the patient.

86
0:04:40.769,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Also of critical importance

87
0:04:43.631,000 --> 0:04:47,000
is the fact that carers also provide emotional support.

88
0:04:48.338,000 --> 0:04:49,000
They organize doctor's appointments,

89
0:04:51.107,000 --> 0:04:52,000
they manage finances,

90
0:04:52.855,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and they also deal with daily household tasks.

91
0:04:57.018,000 --> 0:04:59,000
These challenges are challenges that we can't ignore.

92
0:05:00.633,000 --> 0:05:03,000
There are currently more than 100 million carers

93
0:05:04.103,000 --> 0:05:07,000
providing 80 percent of care across Europe.

94
0:05:08.617,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And even if these numbers are impressive,

95
0:05:10.954,000 --> 0:05:14,000
they're most likely underestimated, given the lack of recognition of carers.

96
0:05:15.412,000 --> 0:05:16,000
As we have just seen,

97
0:05:16.73,000 --> 0:05:19,000
many of you in this room weren't sure if you could be qualified

98
0:05:20.143,000 --> 0:05:22,000
or considered to be a carer.

99
0:05:22.246,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Many of you probably thought I was referring to a nurse

100
0:05:24.882,000 --> 0:05:25,000
or some other healthcare professional.

101
0:05:27.602,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Also stunning

102
0:05:29.12,000 --> 0:05:32,000
are the benefits that carers bring to our societies.

103
0:05:32.862,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I want to give you just one example from Australia in 2015.

104
0:05:37.607,000 --> 0:05:4,000
The annual value provided by informal carers

105
0:05:40.984,000 --> 0:05:42,000
to those suffering from mental illness

106
0:05:43.036,000 --> 0:05:47,000
was evaluated at 13.2 billion Australian dollars.

107
0:05:48.431,000 --> 0:05:51,000
This is nearly two times what the Australian government spends

108
0:05:51.998,000 --> 0:05:52,000
on mental health services annually.

109
0:05:53.982,000 --> 0:05:55,000
These numbers, among others,

110
0:05:56.234,000 --> 0:05:59,000
demonstrate that if carers were to stop caring tomorrow,

111
0:05:59.417,000 --> 0:06:02,000
our health and social systems would crumble.

112
0:06:04.168,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And while the importance of these millions of silent carers

113
0:06:06.955,000 --> 0:06:07,000
cannot be denied,

114
0:06:08.89,000 --> 0:06:1,000
they've largely been unnoticed

115
0:06:10.962,000 --> 0:06:12,000
by governments, healthcare systems

116
0:06:13.942,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and private entities.

117
0:06:17.042,000 --> 0:06:21,000
In addition, carers are facing enormous personal challenges.

118
0:06:21.792,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Many carers face higher costs and can face financial difficulties,

119
0:06:25.815,000 --> 0:06:28,000
given the fact that they may not be able to work full time

120
0:06:28.925,000 --> 0:06:3,000
or they may not be able to hold down a job altogether.

121
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Many studies have shown

122
0:06:33.554,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that often carers sacrifice their own health and well-being

123
0:06:36.577,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in order to care for their loved ones.

124
0:06:39.395,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Many carers spend so much time caring for their loved ones

125
0:06:43.074,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that often their family and their relationships can suffer.

126
0:06:46.941,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Many carers report that often,

127
0:06:48.653,000 --> 0:06:5,000
their employers don't have adequate policies in place

128
0:06:51.379,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to support them.

129
0:06:53.157,000 --> 0:06:54,000
There has been improvement, though,

130
0:06:54.874,000 --> 0:06:56,000
in the recognition of carers around the world.

131
0:06:57.718,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Just a few years ago, an umbrella organization

132
0:07:00.286,000 --> 0:07:04,000
called the International Alliance of Carer Organizations, or IACO,

133
0:07:04.632,000 --> 0:07:07,000
was formed to bring together carer groups from all over the world,

134
0:07:08.522,000 --> 0:07:1,000
to provide strategic direction,

135
0:07:10.655,000 --> 0:07:12,000
facilitate information sharing,

136
0:07:12.701,000 --> 0:07:15,000
as well as actively advocate for carers on an international level.

137
0:07:17.036,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Private entities are also starting to recognize the situation of carers.

138
0:07:21.836,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I am proud that my personal engagement

139
0:07:24.125,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and enthusiasm towards this topic of carers

140
0:07:26.778,000 --> 0:07:28,000
found an echo in my own workplace.

141
0:07:29.612,000 --> 0:07:31,000
My company is committed to this cause

142
0:07:32.13,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and has developed an unprecedented framework

143
0:07:34.908,000 --> 0:07:36,000
for its employees and society as a whole.

144
0:07:38.471,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The objective is to empower carers

145
0:07:40.924,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to improve their own health and well-being

146
0:07:43.113,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and bring about a greater balance to their lives.

147
0:07:46.875,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Nevertheless, much more needs to be done

148
0:07:50.204,000 --> 0:07:52,000
to complement these relatively isolated initiatives.

149
0:07:54.005,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Our societies are facing increased health pressures,

150
0:07:56.938,000 --> 0:07:58,000
including aging populations,

151
0:07:59.247,000 --> 0:08:02,000
increased incidence of cancer and chronic conditions,

152
0:08:02.678,000 --> 0:08:04,000
widespread inequality,

153
0:08:04.737,000 --> 0:08:05,000
amongst many others.

154
0:08:06.862,000 --> 0:08:07,000
To confront these challenges,

155
0:08:08.75,000 --> 0:08:11,000
policymakers must look beyond traditional healthcare pathways

156
0:08:12.433,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and employment policies

157
0:08:14.418,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and recognize that informal care

158
0:08:16.795,000 --> 0:08:19,000
will continue to form the bedrock of care.

159
0:08:21.456,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Caring for someone should be a choice

160
0:08:24.644,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and should be done without putting one's own well-being in the balance.

161
0:08:31.129,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But to really put the care back into health care,

162
0:08:35.671,000 --> 0:08:4,000
what's needed is a deep, societal, structural change.

163
0:08:42.013,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And this can only happen through a change in mindset.

164
0:08:45.371,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And this can start today.

165
0:08:48.182,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Today, we can plant the seed for a change

166
0:08:51.09,000 --> 0:08:53,000
for millions of carers around the world.

167
0:08:53.927,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Here's what I want to suggest:

168
0:08:56.216,000 --> 0:08:57,000
when you go home today

169
0:08:58.318,000 --> 0:09:,000
or to the office tomorrow morning,

170
0:09:00.666,000 --> 0:09:01,000
embrace a carer.

171
0:09:03.012,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Thank them,

172
0:09:04.756,000 --> 0:09:05,000
offer him or her a bit of help,

173
0:09:07.284,000 --> 0:09:1,000
maybe even volunteer as a carer yourself for a couple hours a week.

174
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
If carers around the world felt better recognized,

175
0:09:14.935,000 --> 0:09:16,000
it would not only improve their own health and well-being

176
0:09:17.768,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and sense of fulfillment,

177
0:09:19.5,000 --> 0:09:22,000
but it would also improve the lives of those that they're caring for.

178
0:09:23.531,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Let's care more.

179
0:09:25.484,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Thank you.

180
0:09:26.659,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Applause)

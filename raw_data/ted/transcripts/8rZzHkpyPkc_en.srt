1
0:00:12.212,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When I was a young man, I spent six years

2
0:00:14.285,000 --> 0:00:16,000
of wild adventure in the tropics

3
0:00:16.398,000 --> 0:00:18,000
working as an investigative journalist

4
0:00:18.526,000 --> 0:00:21,000
in some of the most bewitching parts of the world.

5
0:00:21.911,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I was as reckless and foolish as only young men can be.

6
0:00:25.11,000 --> 0:00:26,000
This is why wars get fought.

7
0:00:26.648,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But I also felt more alive than I've ever done since.

8
0:00:30.875,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And when I came home, I found the scope of my existence

9
0:00:34.768,000 --> 0:00:35,000
gradually diminishing

10
0:00:36.751,000 --> 0:00:4,000
until loading the dishwasher seemed like an interesting challenge.

11
0:00:41.197,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And I found myself sort of

12
0:00:43.337,000 --> 0:00:45,000
scratching at the walls of life,

13
0:00:45.394,000 --> 0:00:47,000
as if I was trying to find a way out

14
0:00:47.432,000 --> 0:00:48,000
into a wider space beyond.

15
0:00:49.319,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I was, I believe, ecologically bored.

16
0:00:53.85,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Now, we evolved in rather more challenging times than these,

17
0:00:58.331,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in a world of horns and tusks and fangs and claws.

18
0:01:03.157,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And we still possess the fear and the courage

19
0:01:05.753,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and the aggression required to navigate those times.

20
0:01:08.946,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But in our comfortable, safe, crowded lands,

21
0:01:13.63,000 --> 0:01:15,000
we have few opportunities to exercise them

22
0:01:16.613,000 --> 0:01:19,000
without harming other people.

23
0:01:19.765,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And this was the sort of constraint that I found myself

24
0:01:23.903,000 --> 0:01:25,000
bumping up against.

25
0:01:26.153,000 --> 0:01:28,000
To conquer uncertainty,

26
0:01:28.765,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to know what comes next,

27
0:01:32.083,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that's almost been the dominant aim of industrialized societies,

28
0:01:36.653,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and having got there, or almost got there,

29
0:01:40.253,000 --> 0:01:43,000
we have just encountered a new set of unmet needs.

30
0:01:43.616,000 --> 0:01:46,000
We've privileged safety over experience

31
0:01:46.618,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and we've gained a lot in doing so,

32
0:01:49.122,000 --> 0:01:52,000
but I think we've lost something too.

33
0:01:52.13,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Now, I don't romanticize evolutionary time.

34
0:01:54.932,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I'm already beyond the lifespan of most hunter-gatherers,

35
0:01:58.45,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and the outcome of a mortal combat between me

36
0:02:01.679,000 --> 0:02:03,000
myopically stumbling around with a stone-tipped spear

37
0:02:04.592,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and an enraged giant aurochs

38
0:02:07.074,000 --> 0:02:09,000
isn't very hard to predict.

39
0:02:09.556,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Nor was it authenticity that I was looking for.

40
0:02:12.552,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I don't find that a useful or even intelligible concept.

41
0:02:15.692,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I just wanted a richer and rawer life

42
0:02:19.618,000 --> 0:02:21,000
than I've been able to lead in Britain, or, indeed,

43
0:02:22.114,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that we can lead in most parts of the industrialized world.

44
0:02:25.526,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And it was only when I stumbled across an unfamiliar word

45
0:02:31.032,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that I began to understand what I was looking for.

46
0:02:34.637,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And as soon as I found that word,

47
0:02:37.291,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I realized that I wanted to devote

48
0:02:39.319,000 --> 0:02:42,000
much of the rest of my life to it.

49
0:02:43.074,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The word is "rewilding,"

50
0:02:46.575,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and even though rewilding is a young word,

51
0:02:49.357,000 --> 0:02:5,000
it already has several definitions.

52
0:02:51.224,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But there are two in particular that fascinate me.

53
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The first one is the mass restoration

54
0:02:59.211,000 --> 0:03:01,000
of ecosystems.

55
0:03:01.866,000 --> 0:03:03,000
One of the most exciting scientific findings

56
0:03:04.836,000 --> 0:03:05,000
of the past half century

57
0:03:06.606,000 --> 0:03:1,000
has been the discovery of widespread trophic cascades.

58
0:03:11.352,000 --> 0:03:14,000
A trophic cascade is an ecological process

59
0:03:14.53,000 --> 0:03:16,000
which starts at the top of the food chain

60
0:03:16.905,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and tumbles all the way down to the bottom,

61
0:03:20.2,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and the classic example is what happened

62
0:03:22.543,000 --> 0:03:24,000
in the Yellowstone National Park in the United States

63
0:03:25.354,000 --> 0:03:29,000
when wolves were reintroduced in 1995.

64
0:03:29.443,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Now, we all know that wolves kill various species of animals,

65
0:03:33.878,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but perhaps we're slightly less aware

66
0:03:36.277,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that they give life to many others.

67
0:03:40.115,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It sounds strange, but just follow me for a while.

68
0:03:43.228,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Before the wolves turned up,

69
0:03:45.054,000 --> 0:03:46,000
they'd been absent for 70 years.

70
0:03:46.713,000 --> 0:03:49,000
The numbers of deer, because there was nothing to hunt them,

71
0:03:49.778,000 --> 0:03:51,000
had built up and built up in the Yellowstone Park,

72
0:03:52.532,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and despite efforts by humans to control them,

73
0:03:55.623,000 --> 0:03:57,000
they'd managed to reduce much of the vegetation there

74
0:03:58.318,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to almost nothing, they'd just grazed it away.

75
0:04:01.739,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But as soon as the wolves arrived,

76
0:04:03.934,000 --> 0:04:04,000
even though they were few in number,

77
0:04:05.761,000 --> 0:04:08,000
they started to have the most remarkable effects.

78
0:04:09.66,000 --> 0:04:11,000
First, of course, they killed some of the deer,

79
0:04:11.831,000 --> 0:04:12,000
but that wasn't the major thing.

80
0:04:13.643,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Much more significantly,

81
0:04:15.674,000 --> 0:04:18,000
they radically changed the behavior of the deer.

82
0:04:18.873,000 --> 0:04:2,000
The deer started avoiding certain parts of the park,

83
0:04:21.786,000 --> 0:04:23,000
the places where they could be trapped most easily,

84
0:04:24.009,000 --> 0:04:26,000
particularly the valleys and the gorges,

85
0:04:26.748,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and immediately those places started to regenerate.

86
0:04:29.937,000 --> 0:04:31,000
In some areas, the height of the trees

87
0:04:32.336,000 --> 0:04:35,000
quintupled in just six years.

88
0:04:35.348,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Bare valley sides quickly became forests of aspen

89
0:04:39.415,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and willow and cottonwood.

90
0:04:41.686,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And as soon as that happened,

91
0:04:43.464,000 --> 0:04:45,000
the birds started moving in.

92
0:04:45.622,000 --> 0:04:47,000
The number of songbirds, of migratory birds,

93
0:04:48.043,000 --> 0:04:5,000
started to increase greatly.

94
0:04:50.117,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The number of beavers started to increase,

95
0:04:52.174,000 --> 0:04:54,000
because beavers like to eat the trees.

96
0:04:54.855,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And beavers, like wolves, are ecosystem engineers.

97
0:04:58.083,000 --> 0:05:,000
They create niches for other species.

98
0:05:00.962,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And the dams they built in the rivers

99
0:05:03.174,000 --> 0:05:05,000
provided habitats for otters and muskrats

100
0:05:06.108,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and ducks and fish and reptiles and amphibians.

101
0:05:10.289,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The wolves killed coyotes, and as a result of that,

102
0:05:14.394,000 --> 0:05:16,000
the number of rabbits and mice began to rise,

103
0:05:16.856,000 --> 0:05:18,000
which meant more hawks, more weasels,

104
0:05:19.766,000 --> 0:05:21,000
more foxes, more badgers.

105
0:05:22.165,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Ravens and bald eagles came down to feed

106
0:05:24.652,000 --> 0:05:26,000
on the carrion that the wolves had left.

107
0:05:26.888,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Bears fed on it too, and their population began to rise as well,

108
0:05:30.597,000 --> 0:05:32,000
partly also because there were more berries

109
0:05:32.94,000 --> 0:05:34,000
growing on the regenerating shrubs,

110
0:05:35.252,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and the bears reinforced the impact of the wolves

111
0:05:38.483,000 --> 0:05:42,000
by killing some of the calves of the deer.

112
0:05:42.882,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But here's where it gets really interesting.

113
0:05:46.558,000 --> 0:05:51,000
The wolves changed the behavior of the rivers.

114
0:05:51.843,000 --> 0:05:52,000
They began to meander less.

115
0:05:53.53,000 --> 0:05:56,000
There was less erosion. The channels narrowed.

116
0:05:57.153,000 --> 0:05:59,000
More pools formed, more riffle sections,

117
0:05:59.548,000 --> 0:06:01,000
all of which were great for wildlife habitats.

118
0:06:01.779,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The rivers changed

119
0:06:03.981,000 --> 0:06:05,000
in response to the wolves,

120
0:06:06.193,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and the reason was that the regenerating forests

121
0:06:09.838,000 --> 0:06:12,000
stabilized the banks so that they collapsed less often,

122
0:06:13.529,000 --> 0:06:16,000
so that the rivers became more fixed in their course.

123
0:06:16.849,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Similarly, by driving the deer out of some places

124
0:06:20.576,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and the vegetation recovering on the valley sides,

125
0:06:24.932,000 --> 0:06:25,000
there was less soil erosion,

126
0:06:26.345,000 --> 0:06:29,000
because the vegetation stabilized that as well.

127
0:06:29.881,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So the wolves, small in number,

128
0:06:33.242,000 --> 0:06:35,000
transformed not just the ecosystem

129
0:06:36.205,000 --> 0:06:39,000
of the Yellowstone National Park, this huge area of land,

130
0:06:39.307,000 --> 0:06:43,000
but also its physical geography.

131
0:06:43.525,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Whales in the southern oceans

132
0:06:45.149,000 --> 0:06:47,000
have similarly wide-ranging effects.

133
0:06:47.652,000 --> 0:06:49,000
One of the many post-rational excuses

134
0:06:50.519,000 --> 0:06:52,000
made by the Japanese government for killing whales

135
0:06:53.509,000 --> 0:06:56,000
is that they said, "Well, the number of fish and krill will rise

136
0:06:56.643,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and then there'll be more for people to eat."

137
0:06:58.881,000 --> 0:07:,000
Well, it's a stupid excuse, but it sort of

138
0:07:00.892,000 --> 0:07:01,000
kind of makes sense, doesn't it,

139
0:07:02.261,000 --> 0:07:04,000
because you'd think that whales eat huge amounts

140
0:07:04.385,000 --> 0:07:06,000
of fish and krill, so obviously take the whales away,

141
0:07:06.547,000 --> 0:07:08,000
there'll be more fish and krill.

142
0:07:08.609,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But the opposite happened.

143
0:07:11.002,000 --> 0:07:12,000
You take the whales away,

144
0:07:12.331,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and the number of krill collapses.

145
0:07:15.182,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Why would that possibly have happened?

146
0:07:17.275,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Well, it now turns out that the whales are crucial

147
0:07:20.415,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to sustaining that entire ecosystem,

148
0:07:23.728,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and one of the reasons for this

149
0:07:25.457,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is that they often feed at depth

150
0:07:27.557,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and then they come up to the surface and produce

151
0:07:29.339,000 --> 0:07:33,000
what biologists politely call large fecal plumes,

152
0:07:33.525,000 --> 0:07:37,000
huge explosions of poop right across the surface waters,

153
0:07:37.958,000 --> 0:07:4,000
up in the photic zone, where there's enough light

154
0:07:41.274,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to allow photosynthesis to take place,

155
0:07:44.446,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and those great plumes of fertilizer

156
0:07:47.39,000 --> 0:07:48,000
stimulate the growth of phytoplankton,

157
0:07:49.382,000 --> 0:07:5,000
the plant plankton at the bottom of the food chain,

158
0:07:51.296,000 --> 0:07:53,000
which stimulate the growth of zooplankton,

159
0:07:53.394,000 --> 0:07:55,000
which feed the fish and the krill and all the rest of it.

160
0:07:55.691,000 --> 0:07:57,000
The other thing that whales do is that,

161
0:07:57.825,000 --> 0:07:59,000
as they're plunging up and down through the water column,

162
0:08:00.554,000 --> 0:08:02,000
they're kicking the phytoplankton

163
0:08:02.922,000 --> 0:08:03,000
back up towards the surface

164
0:08:04.372,000 --> 0:08:07,000
where it can continue to survive and reproduce.

165
0:08:07.486,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And interestingly, well, we know

166
0:08:10.114,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that plant plankton in the oceans

167
0:08:13.051,000 --> 0:08:14,000
absorb carbon from the atmosphere --

168
0:08:14.858,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the more plant plankton there are,

169
0:08:16.401,000 --> 0:08:17,000
the more carbon they absorb --

170
0:08:18.08,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and eventually they filter down into the abyss

171
0:08:21.162,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and remove that carbon from the atmospheric system.

172
0:08:24.542,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Well, it seems that when whales were at their historic populations,

173
0:08:28.843,000 --> 0:08:31,000
they were probably responsible for sequestering

174
0:08:31.852,000 --> 0:08:34,000
some tens of millions of tons of carbon

175
0:08:35.645,000 --> 0:08:37,000
every year from the atmosphere.

176
0:08:38.334,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And when you look at it like that, you think,

177
0:08:41.561,000 --> 0:08:42,000
wait a minute, here are the wolves

178
0:08:43.42,000 --> 0:08:46,000
changing the physical geography of the Yellowstone National Park.

179
0:08:46.437,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Here are the whales changing

180
0:08:48.296,000 --> 0:08:5,000
the composition of the atmosphere.

181
0:08:50.936,000 --> 0:08:52,000
You begin to see that possibly,

182
0:08:53.246,000 --> 0:08:56,000
the evidence supporting James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis,

183
0:08:56.927,000 --> 0:08:58,000
which conceives of the world as a coherent,

184
0:08:59.514,000 --> 0:09:,000
self-regulating organism,

185
0:09:01.444,000 --> 0:09:06,000
is beginning, at the ecosystem level, to accumulate.

186
0:09:07.178,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Trophic cascades

187
0:09:09.446,000 --> 0:09:11,000
tell us that the natural world

188
0:09:11.507,000 --> 0:09:15,000
is even more fascinating and complex than we thought it was.

189
0:09:16.253,000 --> 0:09:19,000
They tell us that when you take away the large animals,

190
0:09:19.985,000 --> 0:09:22,000
you are left with a radically different ecosystem

191
0:09:23.177,000 --> 0:09:26,000
to one which retains its large animals.

192
0:09:26.349,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And they make, in my view, a powerful case

193
0:09:29.63,000 --> 0:09:33,000
for the reintroduction of missing species.

194
0:09:33.783,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Rewilding, to me,

195
0:09:35.859,000 --> 0:09:38,000
means bringing back some of the missing plants and animals.

196
0:09:39.157,000 --> 0:09:4,000
It means taking down the fences,

197
0:09:40.469,000 --> 0:09:42,000
it means blocking the drainage ditches,

198
0:09:42.493,000 --> 0:09:45,000
it means preventing commercial fishing in some large areas of sea,

199
0:09:45.757,000 --> 0:09:48,000
but otherwise stepping back.

200
0:09:49.171,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It has no view as to what a right ecosystem

201
0:09:52.981,000 --> 0:09:54,000
or a right assemblage of species looks like.

202
0:09:55.682,000 --> 0:09:58,000
It doesn't try to produce a heath or a meadow

203
0:09:59.461,000 --> 0:10:03,000
or a rain forest or a kelp garden or a coral reef.

204
0:10:04.147,000 --> 0:10:06,000
It lets nature decide,

205
0:10:06.164,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and nature, by and large, is pretty good at deciding.

206
0:10:09.983,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Now, I mentioned that there are two definitions

207
0:10:12.258,000 --> 0:10:13,000
of rewilding that interest me.

208
0:10:14.104,000 --> 0:10:15,000
The other one

209
0:10:15.361,000 --> 0:10:18,000
is the rewilding of human life.

210
0:10:18.384,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And I don't see this as an alternative

211
0:10:20.447,000 --> 0:10:21,000
to civilization.

212
0:10:22.371,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I believe we can enjoy the benefits of advanced technology,

213
0:10:25.771,000 --> 0:10:28,000
as we're doing now, but at the same time, if we choose,

214
0:10:29.61,000 --> 0:10:34,000
have access to a richer and wilder life of adventure

215
0:10:34.626,000 --> 0:10:35,000
when we want to because

216
0:10:36.209,000 --> 0:10:4,000
there would be wonderful, rewilded habitats.

217
0:10:40.605,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And the opportunities for this

218
0:10:42.389,000 --> 0:10:46,000
are developing more rapidly than you might think possible.

219
0:10:47.38,000 --> 0:10:49,000
There's one estimate which suggests that in the United States,

220
0:10:50.359,000 --> 0:10:53,000
two thirds of the land which was once forested and then cleared

221
0:10:54.044,000 --> 0:10:57,000
has become reforested as loggers and farmers have retreated,

222
0:10:57.547,000 --> 0:11:,000
particularly from the eastern half of the country.

223
0:11:00.56,000 --> 0:11:01,000
There's another one which suggests

224
0:11:02.217,000 --> 0:11:05,000
that 30 million hectares of land in Europe,

225
0:11:05.68,000 --> 0:11:07,000
an area the size of Poland,

226
0:11:08.187,000 --> 0:11:09,000
will be vacated by farmers

227
0:11:10.018,000 --> 0:11:13,000
between 2000 and 2030.

228
0:11:13.34,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Now, faced with opportunities like that,

229
0:11:16.876,000 --> 0:11:18,000
does it not seem a little unambitious

230
0:11:19.047,000 --> 0:11:22,000
to be thinking only of bringing back wolves, lynx,

231
0:11:22.761,000 --> 0:11:25,000
bears, beavers, bison, boar, moose,

232
0:11:26.36,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and all the other species which are already beginning

233
0:11:28.185,000 --> 0:11:31,000
to move quite rapidly across Europe?

234
0:11:31.449,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Perhaps we should also start thinking

235
0:11:33.973,000 --> 0:11:36,000
about the return of some of our lost megafauna.

236
0:11:37.962,000 --> 0:11:38,000
What megafauna, you say?

237
0:11:39.894,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Well, every continent had one,

238
0:11:42.463,000 --> 0:11:43,000
apart from Antarctica.

239
0:11:43.944,000 --> 0:11:46,000
When Trafalgar Square in London was excavated,

240
0:11:47.582,000 --> 0:11:48,000
the river gravels there were found

241
0:11:49.337,000 --> 0:11:52,000
to be stuffed with the bones of hippopotamus,

242
0:11:52.887,000 --> 0:11:56,000
rhinos, elephants, hyenas, lions.

243
0:11:56.975,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,

244
0:11:58.349,000 --> 0:12:,000
there were lions in Trafalgar Square

245
0:12:00.545,000 --> 0:12:03,000
long before Nelson's Column was built.

246
0:12:03.751,000 --> 0:12:05,000
All these species lived here

247
0:12:06.002,000 --> 0:12:08,000
in the last interglacial period,

248
0:12:08.654,000 --> 0:12:1,000
when temperatures were pretty similar to our own.

249
0:12:11.515,000 --> 0:12:13,000
It's not climate, largely,

250
0:12:13.588,000 --> 0:12:16,000
which has got rid of the world's megafaunas.

251
0:12:17.135,000 --> 0:12:19,000
It's pressure from the human population

252
0:12:19.239,000 --> 0:12:2,000
hunting and destroying their habitats

253
0:12:21.075,000 --> 0:12:23,000
which has done so.

254
0:12:23.126,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And even so, you can still see the shadows

255
0:12:26.914,000 --> 0:12:28,000
of these great beasts in our current ecosystems.

256
0:12:29.622,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Why is it that so many deciduous trees

257
0:12:32.575,000 --> 0:12:36,000
are able to sprout from whatever point the trunk is broken?

258
0:12:37.133,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Why is it that they can withstand the loss

259
0:12:39.202,000 --> 0:12:4,000
of so much of their bark?

260
0:12:40.809,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Why do understory trees,

261
0:12:43.752,000 --> 0:12:48,000
which are subject to lower sheer forces from the wind

262
0:12:48.845,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and have to carry less weight

263
0:12:50.576,000 --> 0:12:52,000
than the big canopy trees,

264
0:12:52.978,000 --> 0:12:55,000
why are they so much tougher and harder to break

265
0:12:56.097,000 --> 0:13:,000
than the canopy trees are?

266
0:13:00.506,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Elephants.

267
0:13:02.478,000 --> 0:13:04,000
They are elephant-adapted.

268
0:13:04.647,000 --> 0:13:06,000
In Europe, for example,

269
0:13:06.935,000 --> 0:13:09,000
they evolved to resist the straight-tusked elephant,

270
0:13:10.078,000 --> 0:13:12,000
elephas antiquus, which was a great beast.

271
0:13:12.366,000 --> 0:13:14,000
It was related to the Asian elephant,

272
0:13:14.542,000 --> 0:13:16,000
but it was a temperate animal, a temperate forest creature.

273
0:13:17.111,000 --> 0:13:19,000
It was a lot bigger than the Asian elephant.

274
0:13:19.641,000 --> 0:13:21,000
But why is it that some of our common shrubs

275
0:13:22.458,000 --> 0:13:25,000
have spines which seem to be over-engineered

276
0:13:25.642,000 --> 0:13:27,000
to resist browsing by deer?

277
0:13:28.305,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Perhaps because they evolved

278
0:13:30.119,000 --> 0:13:33,000
to resist browsing by rhinoceros.

279
0:13:33.382,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Isn't it an amazing thought

280
0:13:35.306,000 --> 0:13:37,000
that every time you wander into a park

281
0:13:38.034,000 --> 0:13:4,000
or down an avenue or through a leafy street,

282
0:13:40.881,000 --> 0:13:43,000
you can see the shadows of these great beasts?

283
0:13:44.492,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Paleoecology, the study of past ecosystems,

284
0:13:48.292,000 --> 0:13:52,000
crucial to an understanding of our own,

285
0:13:52.35,000 --> 0:13:55,000
feels like a portal through which you may pass

286
0:13:55.927,000 --> 0:13:57,000
into an enchanted kingdom.

287
0:13:58.859,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And if we really are looking at areas of land

288
0:14:02.672,000 --> 0:14:06,000
of the sort of sizes I've been talking about becoming available,

289
0:14:06.917,000 --> 0:14:08,000
why not reintroduce some of our lost megafauna,

290
0:14:09.632,000 --> 0:14:1,000
or at least species closely related to those

291
0:14:11.582,000 --> 0:14:13,000
which have become extinct everywhere?

292
0:14:14.543,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Why shouldn't all of us

293
0:14:16.852,000 --> 0:14:18,000
have a Serengeti on our doorsteps?

294
0:14:19.805,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And perhaps this is the most important thing

295
0:14:22.771,000 --> 0:14:23,000
that rewilding offers us,

296
0:14:24.246,000 --> 0:14:27,000
the most important thing that's missing from our lives:

297
0:14:27.84,000 --> 0:14:29,000
hope.

298
0:14:29.957,000 --> 0:14:33,000
In motivating people to love and defend the natural world,

299
0:14:34.354,000 --> 0:14:38,000
an ounce of hope is worth a ton of despair.

300
0:14:39.164,000 --> 0:14:41,000
The story rewilding tells us

301
0:14:41.803,000 --> 0:14:44,000
is that ecological change need not always proceed

302
0:14:45.443,000 --> 0:14:47,000
in one direction.

303
0:14:47.906,000 --> 0:14:49,000
It offers us the hope

304
0:14:50.342,000 --> 0:14:52,000
that our silent spring

305
0:14:52.483,000 --> 0:14:54,000
could be replaced by a raucous summer.

306
0:14:54.814,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Thank you.

307
0:14:56.034,000 --> 0:15:02,000
(Applause)

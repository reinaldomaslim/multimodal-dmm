1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The first thing I want to do is say thank you to all of you.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
The second thing I want to do is introduce my co-author

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and dear friend and co-teacher.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Ken and I have been working together

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
for almost 40 years.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
That's Ken Sharpe over there.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
(Applause)

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So there is among many people --

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
certainly me and most of the people I talk to --

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
a kind of collective dissatisfaction

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
with the way things are working,

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
with the way our institutions run.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Our kids' teachers seem to be failing them.

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Our doctors don't know who the hell we are,

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and they don't have enough time for us.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We certainly can't trust the bankers,

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and we certainly can't trust the brokers.

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
They almost brought the entire financial system down.

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And even as we do our own work,

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
all too often,

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
we find ourselves having to choose

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
between doing what we think is the right thing

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and doing the expected thing,

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
or the required thing,

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
or the profitable thing.

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So everywhere we look,

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
pretty much across the board,

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
we worry that the people we depend on

29
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
don't really have our interests at heart.

30
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Or if they do have our interests at heart,

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
we worry that they don't know us well enough

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to figure out what they need to do

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
in order to allow us

34
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
to secure those interests.

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
They don't understand us.

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
They don't have the time to get to know us.

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
There are two kinds of responses

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that we make

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
to this sort of general dissatisfaction.

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
If things aren't going right,

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
the first response is:

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
let's make more rules,

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
let's set up a set

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
of detailed procedures

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to make sure that people will do the right thing.

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Give teachers scripts

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to follow in the classroom,

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
so even if they don't know what they're doing

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and don't care about the welfare of our kids,

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
as long as they follow the scripts,

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
our kids will get educated.

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Give judges a list of mandatory sentences

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
to impose for crimes,

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
so that you don't need to rely

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
on judges using their judgment.

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Instead, all they have to do

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is look up on the list

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
what kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime.

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Impose limits

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
on what credit card companies can charge in interest

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and on what they can charge in fees.

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
More and more rules

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to protect us

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
against an indifferent, uncaring

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
set of institutions we have to deal with.

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Or -- or maybe and --

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in addition to rules,

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
let's see if we can come up

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
with some really clever incentives

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
so that, even if the people we deal with

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
don't particularly want to serve our interests,

72
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
it is in their interest

73
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to serve our interest --

74
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the magic incentives

75
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that will get people to do the right thing

76
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
even out of pure selfishness.

77
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So we offer teachers bonuses

78
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
if the kids they teach

79
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
score passing grades on these big test scores

80
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that are used to evaluate

81
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the quality of school systems.

82
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Rules and incentives --

83
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
"sticks" and "carrots."

84
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
We passed a bunch of rules

85
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to regulate the financial industry

86
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
in response to the recent collapse.

87
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
There's the Dodd-Frank Act,

88
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
there's the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency

89
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that is temporarily being headed through the backdoor

90
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
by Elizabeth Warren.

91
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Maybe these rules

92
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
will actually improve

93
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the way these financial services companies behave.

94
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
We'll see.

95
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
In addition, we are struggling

96
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to find some way to create incentives

97
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
for people in the financial services industry

98
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that will have them more interested

99
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
in serving the long-term interests

100
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
even of their own companies,

101
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
rather than securing short-term profits.

102
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So if we find just the right incentives,

103
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
they'll do the right thing -- as I said -- selfishly,

104
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and if we come up with the right rules and regulations,

105
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
they won't drive us all over a cliff.

106
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And Ken [Sharpe] and I certainly know

107
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that you need to reign in the bankers.

108
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
If there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse

109
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
it is that.

110
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But what we believe,

111
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and what we argue in the book,

112
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
is that there is no set of rules,

113
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
no matter how detailed,

114
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
no matter how specific,

115
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
no matter how carefully monitored

116
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and enforced,

117
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
there is no set of rules

118
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that will get us what we need.

119
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Why? Because bankers are smart people.

120
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And, like water,

121
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
they will find cracks

122
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
in any set of rules.

123
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
You design a set of rules that will make sure

124
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that the particular reason

125
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
why the financial system "almost-collapse"

126
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
can't happen again.

127
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It is naive beyond description

128
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
to think that having blocked

129
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
this source of financial collapse,

130
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
you have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse.

131
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So it's just a question of waiting for the next one

132
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid

133
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
as not to protect ourselves against that.

134
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
What we desperately need,

135
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
beyond, or along with, better rules

136
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and reasonably smart incentives,

137
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
is we need virtue.

138
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We need character.

139
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We need people who want to do the right thing.

140
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And in particular,

141
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
the virtue that we need most of all

142
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
is the virtue that Aristotle called

143
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
"practical wisdom."

144
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Practical wisdom

145
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
is the moral will

146
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to do the right thing

147
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and the moral skill

148
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to figure out what the right thing is.

149
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So Aristotle was very interested in watching

150
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
how the craftsmen around him worked.

151
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And he was impressed

152
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
at how they would improvise

153
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
novel solutions to novel problems --

154
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
problems that they hadn't anticipated.

155
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So one example is he sees these stonemasons

156
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
working on the Isle of Lesbos,

157
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and they need to measure out

158
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
round columns.

159
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Well if you think about it,

160
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
it's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler.

161
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So what do they do?

162
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
They fashion a novel solution to the problem.

163
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
They created a ruler that bends,

164
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
what we would call these days a tape measure --

165
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
a flexible rule,

166
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
a rule that bends.

167
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And Aristotle said,

168
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
"Hah, they appreciated that sometimes

169
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to design rounded columns,

170
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
you need to bend the rule."

171
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And Aristotle said

172
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
often in dealing with other people,

173
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
we need to bend the rules.

174
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Dealing with other people

175
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
demands a kind of flexibility

176
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that no set of rules can encompass.

177
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Wise people know when and how

178
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to bend the rules.

179
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Wise people know how to improvise.

180
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The way my co-author , Ken, and I talk about it,

181
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
they are kind of like jazz musicians.

182
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
The rules are like the notes on the page,

183
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and that gets you started,

184
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
but then you dance around the notes on the page,

185
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
coming up with just the right combination

186
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
for this particular moment

187
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
with this particular set of fellow players.

188
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So for Aristotle,

189
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
the kind

190
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
of rule-bending,

191
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
rule exception-finding and improvisation

192
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
that you see in skilled craftsmen

193
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
is exactly what you need

194
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to be a skilled moral craftsman.

195
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And in interactions with people,

196
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
almost all the time,

197
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
it is this kind of flexibility that is required.

198
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
A wise person knows when to bend the rules.

199
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
A wise person knows when to improvise.

200
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And most important,

201
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
a wise person does this improvising and rule-bending

202
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in the service of the right aims.

203
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
If you are a rule-bender and an improviser

204
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
mostly to serve yourself,

205
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people.

206
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So it matters that you do this wise practice

207
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
in the service of others

208
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and not in the service of yourself.

209
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And so the will to do the right thing

210
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
is just as important as the moral skill

211
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
of improvisation

212
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and exception-finding.

213
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Together they comprise practical wisdom,

214
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
which Aristotle thought

215
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
was the master virtue.

216
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So I'll give you an example

217
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
of wise practice in action.

218
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It's the case of Michael.

219
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Michael's a young guy.

220
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
He had a pretty low-wage job.

221
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
He was supporting his wife and a child,

222
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and the child was going to parochial school.

223
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Then he lost his job.

224
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
He panicked

225
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
about being able to support his family.

226
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
One night, he drank a little too much,

227
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and he robbed a cab driver --

228
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
stole 50 dollars.

229
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
He robbed him at gunpoint.

230
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
It was a toy gun.

231
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
He got caught. He got tried.

232
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
He got convicted.

233
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines

234
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
required a minimum sentence for a crime like this

235
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
of two years, 24 months.

236
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
The judge on the case, Judge Lois Forer

237
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
thought that this made no sense.

238
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
He had never committed a crime before.

239
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
He was a responsible husband and father.

240
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
He had been faced with desperate circumstances.

241
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
All this would do is wreck a family.

242
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And so she improvised a sentence -- 11 months,

243
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and not only that,

244
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
but release every day to go to work.

245
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Spend your night in jail, spend your day holding down a job.

246
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
He did. He served out his sentence.

247
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
He made restitution

248
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and found himself a new job.

249
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And the family was united.

250
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And it seemed on the road

251
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
to some sort of a decent life --

252
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
a happy ending to a story

253
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
involving wise improvisation

254
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
from a wise judge.

255
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
But it turned out

256
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
the prosecutor was not happy

257
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that Judge Forer ignored the sentencing guidelines

258
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and sort of invented her own,

259
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and so he appealed.

260
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence

261
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
for armed robbery.

262
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
He did after all have a toy gun.

263
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
The mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery

264
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
is five years.

265
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
He won the appeal.

266
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Michael was sentenced to five years in prison.

267
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Judge Forer had to follow the law.

268
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And by the way, this appeal went through

269
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
after he had finished serving his sentence,

270
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
so he was out and working at a job

271
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and taking care of his family

272
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and he had to go back into jail.

273
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Judge Forer did what she was required to do,

274
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and then she quit the bench.

275
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And Michael disappeared.

276
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So that is an example,

277
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
both of wisdom in practice

278
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and the subversion of wisdom

279
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
by rules that are meant, of course, to make things better.

280
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Now consider Ms. Dewey.

281
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Ms. Dewey's a teacher in a Texas elementary school.

282
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
She found herself listening to a consultant one day

283
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
who was trying to help teachers

284
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
boost the test scores of the kids,

285
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
so that the school

286
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
would reach the elite category

287
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
in percentage of kids passing big tests.

288
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
All these schools in Texas compete with one another

289
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
to achieve these milestones,

290
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and there are bonuses and various other treats

291
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that come if you beat the other schools.

292
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So here was the consultant's advice:

293
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
first, don't waste your time on kids

294
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
who are going to pass the test no matter what you do.

295
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Second, don't waste your time

296
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
on kids who can't pass the test

297
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
no matter what you do.

298
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Third, don't waste your time

299
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
on kids who moved into the district

300
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
too late for their scores to be counted.

301
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Focus all of your time and attention

302
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
on the kids who are on the bubble,

303
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
the so-called "bubble kids" --

304
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
kids where your intervention

305
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
can get them just maybe over the line

306
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
from failing to passing.

307
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So Ms. Dewey heard this,

308
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and she shook her head in despair

309
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
while fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on

310
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
and nodding approvingly.

311
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It's like they were about to go play a football game.

312
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
For Ms. Dewey,

313
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
this isn't why she became a teacher.

314
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Now Ken and I are not naive,

315
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and we understand that you need to have rules.

316
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
You need to have incentives.

317
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
People have to make a living.

318
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
But the problem

319
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
with relying on rules and incentives

320
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
is that they demoralize

321
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
professional activity,

322
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and they demoralize professional activity

323
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
in two senses.

324
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
First, they demoralize the people

325
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
who are engaged in the activity.

326
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Judge Forer quits,

327
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened.

328
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And second,

329
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
they demoralize the activity itself.

330
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
The very practice is demoralized,

331
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and the practitioners are demoralized.

332
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
It creates people --

333
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing --

334
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
it creates people

335
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
who are addicted to incentives.

336
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
That is to say, it creates people

337
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
who only do things for incentives.

338
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Now the striking thing about this

339
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
is that psychologists have known this

340
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
for 30 years.

341
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Psychologists have known

342
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
about the negative consequences of incentivizing everything

343
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
for 30 years.

344
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
We know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures,

345
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
they stop caring about the drawing

346
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and care only about the reward.

347
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
If you reward kids for reading books,

348
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
they stop caring about what's in the books

349
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and only care about how long they are.

350
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
If you reward teachers for kids' test scores,

351
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
they stop caring about educating

352
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and only care about test preparation.

353
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
If you were to reward doctors

354
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
for doing more procedures --

355
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
which is the current system -- they would do more.

356
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
If instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures,

357
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
they will do fewer.

358
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
What we want, of course,

359
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures

360
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and do the right amount for the right reason --

361
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
namely, to serve the welfare of their patients.

362
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Psychologists have known this for decades,

363
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and it's time for policymakers

364
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
to start paying attention

365
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and listen to psychologists a little bit,

366
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
instead of economists.

367
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And it doesn't have to be this way.

368
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
We think, Ken and I, that there are real sources of hope.

369
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
We identify one set of people

370
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
in all of these practices

371
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
who we call canny outlaws.

372
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
These are people

373
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
who, being forced to operate

374
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
in a system that demands rule-following

375
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and creates incentives,

376
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
find away around the rules,

377
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
find a way to subvert the rules.

378
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
So there are teachers who have these scripts to follow,

379
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and they know that if they follow these scripts, the kids will learn nothing.

380
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And so what they do is they follow the scripts,

381
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
but they follow the scripts at double-time

382
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and squirrel away little bits of extra time

383
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
during which they teach in the way

384
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
that they actually know is effective.

385
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
So these are little ordinary, everyday heroes,

386
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and they're incredibly admirable,

387
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
but there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity

388
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
in the face of a system

389
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
that either roots them out

390
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
or grinds them down.

391
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
So canny outlaws are better than nothing,

392
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
but it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw

393
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
sustaining that for an indefinite period of time.

394
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
More hopeful

395
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
are people we call system-changers.

396
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
These are people who are looking

397
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
not to dodge the system's rules and regulations,

398
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
but to transform the system,

399
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and we talk about several.

400
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
One in particular

401
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
is a judge named Robert Russell.

402
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
And one day he was faced

403
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
with the case of Gary Pettengill.

404
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Pettengill was a 23-year-old vet

405
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
who had planned to make the army a career,

406
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
but then he got a severe back injury in Iraq,

407
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and that forced him to take a medical discharge.

408
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
He was married, he had a third kid on the way,

409
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
he suffered from PTSD, in addition to the bad back,

410
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and recurrent nightmares,

411
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and he had started using marijuana

412
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
to ease some of the symptoms.

413
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
He was only able to get part-time work because of his back,

414
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table

415
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and take care of his family.

416
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
So he started selling marijuana.

417
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
He was busted in a drug sweep.

418
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
His family was kicked out of their apartment,

419
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and the welfare system

420
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
was threatening to take away his kids.

421
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Under normal sentencing procedures,

422
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Judge Russell would have had little choice

423
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
but to sentence Pettengill to serious jail-time

424
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
as a drug felon.

425
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
But Judge Russell did have an alternative.

426
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
And that's because he was in a special court.

427
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
He was in a court called the Veterans' Court.

428
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
In the Veterans' Court --

429
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
this was the first of its kind in the United States.

430
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Judge Russell created the Veterans' Court.

431
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
It was a court only for veterans

432
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
who had broken the law.

433
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
And he had created it exactly because

434
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
mandatory sentencing laws

435
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
were taking the judgment out of judging.

436
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
No one wanted non-violent offenders --

437
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
and especially non-violent offenders who were veterans to boot --

438
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
to be thrown into prison.

439
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
They wanted to do something about what we all know,

440
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system.

441
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
And what the Veterans' Court did,

442
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
was it treated each criminal as an individual,

443
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
tried to get inside their problems,

444
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
tried to fashion responses to their crimes

445
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
that helped them to rehabilitate themselves,

446
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
and didn't forget about them once the judgment was made.

447
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
Stayed with them, followed up on them,

448
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan

449
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
had been jointly developed

450
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
to get them over the hump.

451
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
There are now 22 cities

452
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
that have Veterans' Courts like this.

453
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
Why has the idea spread?

454
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
Well, one reason is

455
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
that Judge Russell

456
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:47,000
has now seen 108 vets

457
0:18:47.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
in his Veterans' Court

458
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
as of February of this year,

459
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
and out of 108,

460
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
guess how many have gone back through

461
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
the revolving door of justice

462
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
into prison.

463
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
None. None.

464
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
Anyone would glom onto

465
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
a criminal justice system

466
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
that has this kind of a record.

467
0:19:08.26,000 --> 0:19:11,000
So here's is a system-changer, and it seems to be catching.

468
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
There's a banker

469
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
who created a for-profit community bank

470
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
that encouraged bankers -- I know this is hard to believe --

471
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:21,000
encouraged bankers who worked there to do well

472
0:19:21.26,000 --> 0:19:24,000
by doing good for their low-income clients.

473
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
The bank helped finance the rebuilding

474
0:19:27.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
of what was otherwise a dying community.

475
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:33,000
Though their loan recipients were high-risk by ordinary standards,

476
0:19:33.26,000 --> 0:19:36,000
the default rate was extremely low.

477
0:19:36.26,000 --> 0:19:39,000
The bank was profitable.

478
0:19:39.26,000 --> 0:19:41,000
The bankers stayed with their loan recipients.

479
0:19:41.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
They didn't make loans and then sell the loans.

480
0:19:43.26,000 --> 0:19:45,000
They serviced the loans.

481
0:19:45.26,000 --> 0:19:47,000
They made sure that their loan recipients

482
0:19:47.26,000 --> 0:19:5,000
were staying up with their payments.

483
0:19:50.26,000 --> 0:19:53,000
Banking hasn't always been

484
0:19:53.26,000 --> 0:19:57,000
the way we read about it now in the newspapers.

485
0:19:57.26,000 --> 0:19:59,000
Even Goldman Sachs

486
0:19:59.26,000 --> 0:20:02,000
once used to serve clients,

487
0:20:02.26,000 --> 0:20:05,000
before it turned into an institution

488
0:20:05.26,000 --> 0:20:07,000
that serves only itself.

489
0:20:07.26,000 --> 0:20:09,000
Banking wasn't always this way,

490
0:20:09.26,000 --> 0:20:12,000
and it doesn't have to be this way.

491
0:20:14.26,000 --> 0:20:17,000
So there are examples like this in medicine --

492
0:20:17.26,000 --> 0:20:19,000
doctors at Harvard

493
0:20:19.26,000 --> 0:20:21,000
who are trying to transform medical education,

494
0:20:21.26,000 --> 0:20:23,000
so that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion

495
0:20:23.26,000 --> 0:20:25,000
and loss of empathy,

496
0:20:25.26,000 --> 0:20:27,000
which characterizes most medical students

497
0:20:27.26,000 --> 0:20:29,000
in the course of their medical training.

498
0:20:29.26,000 --> 0:20:32,000
And the way they do it is to give third-year medical students

499
0:20:32.26,000 --> 0:20:34,000
patients who they follow for an entire year.

500
0:20:34.26,000 --> 0:20:36,000
So the patients are not organ systems,

501
0:20:36.26,000 --> 0:20:38,000
and they're not diseases;

502
0:20:38.26,000 --> 0:20:4,000
they're people, people with lives.

503
0:20:40.26,000 --> 0:20:42,000
And in order to be an effective doctor,

504
0:20:42.26,000 --> 0:20:45,000
you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease.

505
0:20:45.26,000 --> 0:20:48,000
In addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth,

506
0:20:48.26,000 --> 0:20:5,000
mentoring of one student by another,

507
0:20:50.26,000 --> 0:20:53,000
of all the students by the doctors,

508
0:20:53.26,000 --> 0:20:56,000
and the result is a generation -- we hope -- of doctors

509
0:20:56.26,000 --> 0:20:58,000
who do have time for the people they treat.

510
0:20:58.26,000 --> 0:21:,000
We'll see.

511
0:21:00.26,000 --> 0:21:03,000
So there are lots of examples like this that we talk about.

512
0:21:03.26,000 --> 0:21:05,000
Each of them shows that it is possible

513
0:21:05.26,000 --> 0:21:08,000
to build on and nurture character

514
0:21:08.26,000 --> 0:21:1,000
and keep a profession

515
0:21:10.26,000 --> 0:21:12,000
true to its proper mission --

516
0:21:12.26,000 --> 0:21:15,000
what Aristotle would have called its proper telos.

517
0:21:16.26,000 --> 0:21:18,000
And Ken and I believe

518
0:21:18.26,000 --> 0:21:21,000
that this is what practitioners actually want.

519
0:21:21.26,000 --> 0:21:23,000
People want to be allowed

520
0:21:23.26,000 --> 0:21:25,000
to be virtuous.

521
0:21:25.26,000 --> 0:21:28,000
They want to have permission to do the right thing.

522
0:21:28.26,000 --> 0:21:3,000
They don't want to feel

523
0:21:30.26,000 --> 0:21:32,000
like they need to take a shower

524
0:21:32.26,000 --> 0:21:35,000
to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday

525
0:21:35.26,000 --> 0:21:38,000
when they come home from work.

526
0:21:38.26,000 --> 0:21:4,000
Aristotle thought that practical wisdom

527
0:21:40.26,000 --> 0:21:42,000
was the key to happiness,

528
0:21:42.26,000 --> 0:21:45,000
and he was right.

529
0:21:45.26,000 --> 0:21:48,000
There's now a lot of research being done in psychology

530
0:21:48.26,000 --> 0:21:5,000
on what makes people happy,

531
0:21:50.26,000 --> 0:21:53,000
and the two things that jump out in study after study --

532
0:21:53.26,000 --> 0:21:55,000
I know this will come as a shock to all of you --

533
0:21:55.26,000 --> 0:21:58,000
the two things that matter most to happiness

534
0:21:58.26,000 --> 0:22:01,000
are love and work.

535
0:22:01.26,000 --> 0:22:04,000
Love: managing successfully

536
0:22:04.26,000 --> 0:22:06,000
relations with the people who are close to you

537
0:22:06.26,000 --> 0:22:09,000
and with the communities of which you are a part.

538
0:22:09.26,000 --> 0:22:12,000
Work: engaging in activities

539
0:22:12.26,000 --> 0:22:15,000
that are meaningful and satisfying.

540
0:22:15.26,000 --> 0:22:18,000
If you have that, good close relations with other people,

541
0:22:18.26,000 --> 0:22:21,000
work that's meaningful and fulfilling,

542
0:22:21.26,000 --> 0:22:24,000
you don't much need anything else.

543
0:22:24.26,000 --> 0:22:27,000
Well, to love well and to work well,

544
0:22:27.26,000 --> 0:22:29,000
you need wisdom.

545
0:22:29.26,000 --> 0:22:31,000
Rules and incentives don't tell you

546
0:22:31.26,000 --> 0:22:34,000
how to be a good friend, how to be a good parent,

547
0:22:34.26,000 --> 0:22:36,000
how to be a good spouse,

548
0:22:36.26,000 --> 0:22:38,000
or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer

549
0:22:38.26,000 --> 0:22:4,000
or a good teacher.

550
0:22:40.26,000 --> 0:22:42,000
Rules and incentives

551
0:22:42.26,000 --> 0:22:44,000
are no substitutes for wisdom.

552
0:22:44.26,000 --> 0:22:46,000
Indeed, we argue,

553
0:22:46.26,000 --> 0:22:49,000
there is no substitute for wisdom.

554
0:22:49.26,000 --> 0:22:51,000
And so practical wisdom

555
0:22:51.26,000 --> 0:22:53,000
does not require

556
0:22:53.26,000 --> 0:22:56,000
heroic acts of self-sacrifice

557
0:22:56.26,000 --> 0:22:59,000
on the part of practitioners.

558
0:22:59.26,000 --> 0:23:01,000
In giving us the will and the skill

559
0:23:01.26,000 --> 0:23:04,000
to do the right thing -- to do right by others --

560
0:23:04.26,000 --> 0:23:06,000
practical wisdom also gives us

561
0:23:06.26,000 --> 0:23:08,000
the will and the skill

562
0:23:08.26,000 --> 0:23:11,000
to do right by ourselves.

563
0:23:11.26,000 --> 0:23:13,000
Thanks.

564
0:23:13.26,000 --> 0:23:16,000
(Applause)

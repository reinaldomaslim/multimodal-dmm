1
0:00:07.63,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I started teaching MBA students 17 years

2
0:00:16.42,000 --> 0:00:21,000
ago and sometimes I run into my students

3
0:00:19.42,000 --> 0:00:24,000
years later and when I run into them a

4
0:00:22.15,000 --> 0:00:27,000
funny thing happens I don't remember

5
0:00:24.43,000 --> 0:00:29,000
just their faces I also remember where

6
0:00:27.61,000 --> 0:00:31,000
exactly in the classroom they were

7
0:00:29.71,000 --> 0:00:33,000
sitting and I also remember who they

8
0:00:32.2,000 --> 0:00:36,000
were sitting with as well and this is

9
0:00:34.48,000 --> 0:00:38,000
not because I have any special super

10
0:00:36.79,000 --> 0:00:4,000
powers of memory the reason I can

11
0:00:39.37,000 --> 0:00:43,000
remember them is because they have

12
0:00:41.56,000 --> 0:00:46,000
creatures of habit they are sitting with

13
0:00:43.93,000 --> 0:00:47,000
the favorite people in their favorite

14
0:00:46.63,000 --> 0:00:52,000
seats they find their twins they stay

15
0:00:48.58,000 --> 0:00:54,000
with them for the whole year now the

16
0:00:52.75,000 --> 0:00:57,000
danger of this for my students is

17
0:00:55.48,000 --> 0:01:,000
they're at risk of leaving the

18
0:00:58.09,000 --> 0:01:01,000
university with just a few people who

19
0:01:00.49,000 --> 0:01:03,000
are exactly like them they're going to

20
0:01:01.96,000 --> 0:01:05,000
squander their chance for an

21
0:01:04.15,000 --> 0:01:08,000
international diverse network how could

22
0:01:06.61,000 --> 0:01:1,000
this happen to them my students are

23
0:01:08.439,000 --> 0:01:12,000
open-minded they come to business school

24
0:01:10.81,000 --> 0:01:15,000
precisely so that they can great get

25
0:01:12.85,000 --> 0:01:17,000
great networks now all of us socially

26
0:01:15.939,000 --> 0:01:2,000
narrow in our lives in our our our

27
0:01:18.369,000 --> 0:01:23,000
school and in work and so I want you to

28
0:01:21.069,000 --> 0:01:26,000
think about this one how many of you

29
0:01:23.499,000 --> 0:01:28,000
here brought a friend along for this

30
0:01:26.38,000 --> 0:01:31,000
talk and I want you to look at your

31
0:01:28.899,000 --> 0:01:34,000
friend a little bit and are they of the

32
0:01:32.2,000 --> 0:01:37,000
same nationality as you are they have

33
0:01:34.899,000 --> 0:01:39,000
the same gender as you are they of the

34
0:01:37.6,000 --> 0:01:41,000
same race and really look at them

35
0:01:40.24,000 --> 0:01:44,000
closely don't they kind of look like you

36
0:01:42.52,000 --> 0:01:46,000
as well their muscle people are together

37
0:01:45.1,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and the people are the same hair styles

38
0:01:47.319,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and the check shirts we all do this in

39
0:01:51.189,000 --> 0:01:56,000
life we all do it in life and in fact

40
0:01:53.499,000 --> 0:01:57,000
there's nothing wrong with this it makes

41
0:01:56.259,000 --> 0:02:,000
us comfortable to be around people who

42
0:01:58.179,000 --> 0:02:02,000
are similar the problem is when we are

43
0:02:00.85,000 --> 0:02:04,000
on a precipice right when we're in

44
0:02:03.1,000 --> 0:02:08,000
trouble when we need new ideas when we

45
0:02:05.02,000 --> 0:02:11,000
need new jobs when we need new resources

46
0:02:08.41,000 --> 0:02:14,000
this is when we really pay a price for

47
0:02:11.68,000 --> 0:02:17,000
living in a click mark Granovetter the

48
0:02:14.53,000 --> 0:02:19,000
sociologist he had a famous paper called

49
0:02:18.1,000 --> 0:02:22,000
the strength of weak ties and

50
0:02:20.48,000 --> 0:02:24,000
what he did in this papers he asked

51
0:02:22.19,000 --> 0:02:26,000
people how they got their jobs and what

52
0:02:25.19,000 --> 0:02:28,000
he learned was that most people don't

53
0:02:26.599,000 --> 0:02:3,000
get their jobs through their strong ties

54
0:02:28.909,000 --> 0:02:31,000
their father their mother their

55
0:02:30.68,000 --> 0:02:35,000
significant other they instead get jobs

56
0:02:32.9,000 --> 0:02:36,000
through weak ties people who they just

57
0:02:35.87,000 --> 0:02:38,000
met so if you think about what the

58
0:02:37.519,000 --> 0:02:4,000
problem is with your strong ties think

59
0:02:39.319,000 --> 0:02:43,000
about your significant other for example

60
0:02:41.209,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the network is redundant

61
0:02:43.489,000 --> 0:02:49,000
everybody that they know you know or I

62
0:02:46.579,000 --> 0:02:51,000
hope you know them right your weak ties

63
0:02:49.76,000 --> 0:02:55,000
people you just met today they are your

64
0:02:52.4,000 --> 0:02:57,000
ticket to a whole new social world the

65
0:02:55.97,000 --> 0:02:59,000
thing is that we have this amazing

66
0:02:57.92,000 --> 0:03:01,000
ticket to travel our social world but we

67
0:03:00.56,000 --> 0:03:04,000
don't use it very well sometimes we stay

68
0:03:02.569,000 --> 0:03:06,000
awfully close to home and today what I

69
0:03:05.269,000 --> 0:03:09,000
want to talk about is what are those

70
0:03:06.829,000 --> 0:03:11,000
habits that keep human being so close to

71
0:03:09.44,000 --> 0:03:14,000
home and how can we be a little bit more

72
0:03:12.349,000 --> 0:03:16,000
intentional about traveling our social

73
0:03:14.72,000 --> 0:03:2,000
universe so let's look at the first

74
0:03:17.12,000 --> 0:03:24,000
strategy the first strategy is to use a

75
0:03:20.81,000 --> 0:03:25,000
more imperfect social search engine and

76
0:03:24.23,000 --> 0:03:28,000
what I mean by a social search engine

77
0:03:26.419,000 --> 0:03:31,000
this is how you are finding and

78
0:03:28.79,000 --> 0:03:32,000
filtering your friends okay and so

79
0:03:31.88,000 --> 0:03:34,000
people always tell me I want to get

80
0:03:33.68,000 --> 0:03:36,000
lucky through the network I'm gonna get

81
0:03:35.09,000 --> 0:03:39,000
a new job I want to get a great

82
0:03:36.799,000 --> 0:03:4,000
opportunity and I say well that's really

83
0:03:39.53,000 --> 0:03:44,000
hard because your networks are so

84
0:03:41.389,000 --> 0:03:46,000
fundamentally predictable map out your

85
0:03:44.62,000 --> 0:03:48,000
habitual daily foot path and what you'll

86
0:03:47.18,000 --> 0:03:51,000
probably discover is that you could

87
0:03:49.43,000 --> 0:03:53,000
start at home you go to your school or

88
0:03:51.41,000 --> 0:03:56,000
your work place you maybe go up the same

89
0:03:54.019,000 --> 0:03:58,000
staircase or elevator you go to the

90
0:03:56.599,000 --> 0:04:,000
bathroom the same bathroom and the same

91
0:03:58.669,000 --> 0:04:02,000
stall in that bathroom you end up in the

92
0:04:00.609,000 --> 0:04:05,000
gym then you come right back home it's

93
0:04:03.23,000 --> 0:04:08,000
like stops on a train schedule it's that

94
0:04:05.69,000 --> 0:04:1,000
predictable it's efficient but the

95
0:04:08.389,000 --> 0:04:12,000
problem is that that you're seeing

96
0:04:10.76,000 --> 0:04:15,000
exactly the same people make your

97
0:04:13.19,000 --> 0:04:18,000
network slightly more inefficient go to

98
0:04:15.919,000 --> 0:04:19,000
a bathroom on a different floor you

99
0:04:18.229,000 --> 0:04:24,000
encounter a whole new network of people

100
0:04:20.889,000 --> 0:04:26,000
the the other side of it is how we are

101
0:04:24.68,000 --> 0:04:27,000
actually filtering and we do this

102
0:04:26.96,000 --> 0:04:28,000
automatically

103
0:04:27.889,000 --> 0:04:3,000
the minute we meet someone we are

104
0:04:29.81,000 --> 0:04:32,000
looking at them to meet them

105
0:04:31.039,000 --> 0:04:34,000
we're initially seeing you're

106
0:04:32.99,000 --> 0:04:35,000
interesting you're not

107
0:04:34.27,000 --> 0:04:37,000
interesting you're relevant we do this

108
0:04:36.37,000 --> 0:04:4,000
automatically we can't even help it and

109
0:04:38.19,000 --> 0:04:42,000
what I want to encourage you to do

110
0:04:40.66,000 --> 0:04:44,000
instead is to fight your filters I want

111
0:04:42.64,000 --> 0:04:46,000
you to take a look around this room and

112
0:04:44.89,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I want you to identify the least

113
0:04:46.9,000 --> 0:04:5,000
interesting person that you see and I

114
0:04:49.42,000 --> 0:04:53,000
want you to connect with them over the

115
0:04:50.98,000 --> 0:04:54,000
next coffee break and I want you to go

116
0:04:53.5,000 --> 0:04:57,000
even further than that what I want you

117
0:04:55.51,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to do is to find the most irritating

118
0:04:57.76,000 --> 0:05:02,000
person you see as well and connect with

119
0:05:00.43,000 --> 0:05:05,000
them what you are doing with this

120
0:05:03.22,000 --> 0:05:08,000
exercise is you are forcing yourself

121
0:05:05.8,000 --> 0:05:11,000
you're forcing yourself to see what you

122
0:05:09.04,000 --> 0:05:14,000
don't want to see to connect with who

123
0:05:11.92,000 --> 0:05:16,000
you don't want to connect to widen your

124
0:05:14.29,000 --> 0:05:2,000
social world to truly widen what we have

125
0:05:17.41,000 --> 0:05:21,000
to do is we've got to fight our sense of

126
0:05:20.29,000 --> 0:05:23,000
choice you've got to fight our choices

127
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and my students hate this but you know

128
0:05:24.13,000 --> 0:05:27,000
what I do I won't let them sit in their

129
0:05:25.75,000 --> 0:05:29,000
favorite seats I move them around from

130
0:05:28.03,000 --> 0:05:32,000
seat to seat I force them to work with

131
0:05:30.25,000 --> 0:05:34,000
different people so that there are more

132
0:05:32.08,000 --> 0:05:35,000
accidental bumps in the network where

133
0:05:34.3,000 --> 0:05:38,000
people get a chance to connect with each

134
0:05:35.92,000 --> 0:05:4,000
other and we studied exactly this kind

135
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
of an intervention at Harvard University

136
0:05:41.23,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and at Harvard when you look at the

137
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
rooming groups there's freshmen rooming

138
0:05:45.76,000 --> 0:05:48,000
groups people are not choosing those

139
0:05:47.65,000 --> 0:05:5,000
roommates there of all different races

140
0:05:49.6,000 --> 0:05:52,000
all different ethnicities many people

141
0:05:51.49,000 --> 0:05:54,000
are initially uncomfortable with those

142
0:05:53.17,000 --> 0:05:57,000
roommates but the amazing thing is at

143
0:05:55.3,000 --> 0:05:59,000
the end of a year with those students

144
0:05:57.31,000 --> 0:06:02,000
they're able to overcome that initial

145
0:06:00.1,000 --> 0:06:05,000
discomfort they're able to find deep

146
0:06:02.44,000 --> 0:06:08,000
level commonalities with people so the

147
0:06:05.5,000 --> 0:06:1,000
takeaway here is not just take someone

148
0:06:09.25,000 --> 0:06:14,000
out to coffee it's a little more subtle

149
0:06:11.11,000 --> 0:06:16,000
it's go to the coffee room and when

150
0:06:14.74,000 --> 0:06:18,000
researchers talk about social hubs what

151
0:06:16.87,000 --> 0:06:2,000
makes a social hub so special is you

152
0:06:19.3,000 --> 0:06:23,000
can't choose you can't predict who

153
0:06:21.82,000 --> 0:06:26,000
you're going to meet in that place and

154
0:06:24.04,000 --> 0:06:29,000
so with these social hubs the the

155
0:06:27.28,000 --> 0:06:31,000
paradox is interestingly enough to get

156
0:06:30.01,000 --> 0:06:35,000
randomness it requires actually some

157
0:06:32.23,000 --> 0:06:37,000
planning in one university that I worked

158
0:06:35.44,000 --> 0:06:39,000
at there was a mail room on every single

159
0:06:37.78,000 --> 0:06:4,000
floor what that meant is that the only

160
0:06:40.09,000 --> 0:06:43,000
people who would bump into each other

161
0:06:41.77,000 --> 0:06:44,000
are those who are actually on that floor

162
0:06:43.81,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and who are bumping into each other

163
0:06:44.92,000 --> 0:06:47,000
anyway at another university I worked at

164
0:06:47.5,000 --> 0:06:5,000
there was only

165
0:06:48.1,000 --> 0:06:53,000
one mail room and so all the faculty

166
0:06:50.8,000 --> 0:06:55,000
from all over that building would run

167
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
into each other in that social hub a

168
0:06:55.8,000 --> 0:07:01,000
simple change in in planning a huge

169
0:06:59.38,000 --> 0:07:03,000
difference in the traffic of people and

170
0:07:02.14,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the accidental bumps in the network and

171
0:07:03.97,000 --> 0:07:07,000
here's my question for you what is what

172
0:07:07.09,000 --> 0:07:11,000
are you doing that breaks you from your

173
0:07:08.95,000 --> 0:07:13,000
social habits where do you find yourself

174
0:07:11.47,000 --> 0:07:16,000
in places where you get injections of

175
0:07:14.05,000 --> 0:07:18,000
diversity unpredictable diversity right

176
0:07:16.75,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and my students give me some wonderful

177
0:07:18.91,000 --> 0:07:22,000
examples they tell me when they're doing

178
0:07:20.92,000 --> 0:07:24,000
pickup basketball games or my favorite

179
0:07:23.68,000 --> 0:07:25,000
example is when they go to a dog park

180
0:07:25.48,000 --> 0:07:29,000
they tell me it's even better than

181
0:07:26.65,000 --> 0:07:32,000
online dating when they're there so be

182
0:07:30.01,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the the real thing that I wanted to

183
0:07:32.77,000 --> 0:07:35,000
think about is we've got to fight our

184
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
filters we've got to make ourselves a

185
0:07:36.7,000 --> 0:07:41,000
little more inefficient and by doing so

186
0:07:39.76,000 --> 0:07:43,000
we're creating a more imprecise social

187
0:07:42.46,000 --> 0:07:45,000
search engine and you're creating that

188
0:07:44.47,000 --> 0:07:48,000
randomness that luck that is going to

189
0:07:46.45,000 --> 0:07:51,000
cause you to widen your travels through

190
0:07:48.97,000 --> 0:07:51,000
your social universe but in fact there's

191
0:07:51.64,000 --> 0:07:55,000
more to it than that

192
0:07:52.74,000 --> 0:07:58,000
sometimes we actually buy ourselves a

193
0:07:56.11,000 --> 0:08:02,000
second-class ticket to travel our social

194
0:07:58.96,000 --> 0:08:03,000
universe we are not courageous when we

195
0:08:02.56,000 --> 0:08:07,000
reach out to people let me give you an

196
0:08:04.78,000 --> 0:08:09,000
example of that a few years ago I had a

197
0:08:07.66,000 --> 0:08:13,000
very eventful year that year I managed

198
0:08:10.72,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to lose a job I managed to get a dream

199
0:08:13.81,000 --> 0:08:18,000
job overseas and accepted I had a baby

200
0:08:16.45,000 --> 0:08:21,000
the next month I got very sick I was

201
0:08:18.94,000 --> 0:08:22,000
unable to take the dream job and so in a

202
0:08:21.79,000 --> 0:08:24,000
few weeks what ended up happening was I

203
0:08:23.83,000 --> 0:08:26,000
lost my identity

204
0:08:25.51,000 --> 0:08:29,000
as a faculty member and I got a very

205
0:08:27.49,000 --> 0:08:32,000
stressful new identity as a mother and

206
0:08:29.92,000 --> 0:08:34,000
what I also got was tons of advice from

207
0:08:32.59,000 --> 0:08:36,000
people and the advice I despised more

208
0:08:35.2,000 --> 0:08:38,000
than any other advice was you've got to

209
0:08:36.669,000 --> 0:08:41,000
go network with everybody when your

210
0:08:39.13,000 --> 0:08:44,000
psychological world is breaking down the

211
0:08:41.95,000 --> 0:08:45,000
hardest thing to do is to try and reach

212
0:08:44.38,000 --> 0:08:49,000
out and build up your social world and

213
0:08:46.42,000 --> 0:08:52,000
so we studied exactly this idea on a

214
0:08:49.66,000 --> 0:08:54,000
much larger scale what we did was we

215
0:08:52.54,000 --> 0:08:57,000
looked at high and low socioeconomic

216
0:08:55.44,000 --> 0:09:,000
status people and we looked at them in

217
0:08:57.91,000 --> 0:09:,000
two situations we looked at them first

218
0:09:00.55,000 --> 0:09:03,000
in a baseline condition

219
0:09:01.87,000 --> 0:09:04,000
when they were quite comfortable and

220
0:09:03.88,000 --> 0:09:07,000
what we found was that our lower

221
0:09:05.86,000 --> 0:09:08,000
socioeconomic status people when they

222
0:09:08.05,000 --> 0:09:1,000
were comfortable they were actually

223
0:09:09.04,000 --> 0:09:13,000
reaching out to more people they thought

224
0:09:10.99,000 --> 0:09:13,000
of more people they were also less

225
0:09:13.089,000 --> 0:09:15,000
constrained in how they were networking

226
0:09:14.8,000 --> 0:09:17,000
they were thinking of more diverse

227
0:09:15.73,000 --> 0:09:2,000
people then the higher status people

228
0:09:18.46,000 --> 0:09:23,000
then we asked them to think about maybe

229
0:09:21.13,000 --> 0:09:26,000
losing a job we threatened them and once

230
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
they thought about that the networks

231
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
they generated completely differs the

232
0:09:28.72,000 --> 0:09:32,000
lower socioeconomic status people they

233
0:09:31.06,000 --> 0:09:35,000
reached in words they thought of fewer

234
0:09:32.92,000 --> 0:09:37,000
people they thought of less diverse

235
0:09:35.47,000 --> 0:09:39,000
people the higher socioeconomic status

236
0:09:37.99,000 --> 0:09:4,000
people they thought of more people they

237
0:09:39.88,000 --> 0:09:43,000
thought of a broader network they were

238
0:09:41.52,000 --> 0:09:47,000
positioning themselves to bounce back

239
0:09:44.23,000 --> 0:09:5,000
from that setback let's consider what

240
0:09:47.56,000 --> 0:09:53,000
this actually means imagine that you are

241
0:09:50.86,000 --> 0:09:56,000
being spontaneously unfriended by

242
0:09:54.04,000 --> 0:10:01,000
everyone in your network other than your

243
0:09:57.76,000 --> 0:10:03,000
mom your dad and your dog okay this is

244
0:10:01.57,000 --> 0:10:05,000
essentially what we are doing at these

245
0:10:04.3,000 --> 0:10:08,000
moments when we need our networks the

246
0:10:06.459,000 --> 0:10:1,000
most right imagine this is what we

247
0:10:09.22,000 --> 0:10:13,000
remember doing it to ourselves we are

248
0:10:11.35,000 --> 0:10:15,000
mentally compressing our networks when

249
0:10:13.3,000 --> 0:10:16,000
we are being harassed when we are being

250
0:10:15.459,000 --> 0:10:19,000
bullied when we are threatened about

251
0:10:16.99,000 --> 0:10:22,000
losing a job when we feel down and weak

252
0:10:19.959,000 --> 0:10:23,000
we are closing ourselves off isolating

253
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
ourselves creating a blind spot where we

254
0:10:24.73,000 --> 0:10:28,000
actually don't see our resources we

255
0:10:27.4,000 --> 0:10:31,000
don't see our allies we don't see our

256
0:10:29.14,000 --> 0:10:34,000
opportunities how can we overcome this

257
0:10:31.45,000 --> 0:10:36,000
two simple strategies one strategy is

258
0:10:34.57,000 --> 0:10:38,000
simply to look at your list of Facebook

259
0:10:36.67,000 --> 0:10:4,000
friends and LinkedIn friends just so you

260
0:10:38.86,000 --> 0:10:42,000
remind yourself of people who are there

261
0:10:41.29,000 --> 0:10:45,000
beyond those that automatically come to

262
0:10:43.42,000 --> 0:10:47,000
mind and in our own research one of the

263
0:10:46.06,000 --> 0:10:5,000
things we did was we considered Claude

264
0:10:48.13,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Steele's research on self affirmation

265
0:10:50.56,000 --> 0:10:54,000
simply thinking about your own values

266
0:10:53.17,000 --> 0:10:57,000
networking from a place of strength what

267
0:10:55.42,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Lee Thompson who in Sokcho and I were

268
0:10:57.19,000 --> 0:11:01,000
able to do is we found that people who

269
0:10:59.56,000 --> 0:11:02,000
had affirmed themselves first were able

270
0:11:01.63,000 --> 0:11:06,000
to take advice from people who would

271
0:11:03.279,000 --> 0:11:1,000
otherwise be threatening to them here's

272
0:11:06.91,000 --> 0:11:12,000
a last exercise I want you to look in

273
0:11:10.54,000 --> 0:11:14,000
your email inbox and I want you to look

274
0:11:13.06,000 --> 0:11:15,000
at the last time you asked somebody for

275
0:11:15.1,000 --> 0:11:17,000
a favor

276
0:11:15.64,000 --> 0:11:19,000
I want you to look at the language that

277
0:11:17.83,000 --> 0:11:22,000
you used did you say things like oh

278
0:11:20.47,000 --> 0:11:25,000
you're a great resource or I owe you one

279
0:11:23.11,000 --> 0:11:28,000
I'm obligated to you all of this

280
0:11:25.99,000 --> 0:11:3,000
language represents a metaphor it's a

281
0:11:28.93,000 --> 0:11:33,000
metaphor of economics of a balance sheet

282
0:11:31.57,000 --> 0:11:35,000
of accounting of transactions and when

283
0:11:34.3,000 --> 0:11:37,000
we think about human relations in a

284
0:11:35.83,000 --> 0:11:4,000
transactional way it is fundamentally

285
0:11:38.1,000 --> 0:11:43,000
uncomfortable to us as human beings we

286
0:11:41.5,000 --> 0:11:45,000
must think about human relations and

287
0:11:43.45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
reaching out to people in more humane

288
0:11:45.94,000 --> 0:11:51,000
ways and here's an idea as to how to do

289
0:11:49.36,000 --> 0:11:53,000
so look at words like please thank you

290
0:11:52.75,000 --> 0:11:54,000
you're welcome

291
0:11:53.68,000 --> 0:11:57,000
in other languages look at the literal

292
0:11:55.63,000 --> 0:11:59,000
translation of these words each of these

293
0:11:57.7,000 --> 0:12:01,000
words is a word that helps us impose

294
0:11:59.95,000 --> 0:12:03,000
upon other people in our social networks

295
0:12:01.81,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and so the word thank you if you look at

296
0:12:04.87,000 --> 0:12:1,000
it in Spanish Italian French

297
0:12:06.91,000 --> 0:12:12,000
gracias grazie merci in French each of

298
0:12:10.93,000 --> 0:12:14,000
them are grace and mercy they're godly

299
0:12:13.57,000 --> 0:12:17,000
words there's nothing economic or

300
0:12:15.55,000 --> 0:12:2,000
transactional about those words the word

301
0:12:18.46,000 --> 0:12:22,000
you're welcome is interesting the great

302
0:12:20.71,000 --> 0:12:23,000
persuasion theorist Robert childen he

303
0:12:22.69,000 --> 0:12:25,000
says we got to get our favours back so

304
0:12:24.49,000 --> 0:12:27,000
we need to emphasize the transaction a

305
0:12:26.59,000 --> 0:12:28,000
little bit more he says let's not say

306
0:12:28.12,000 --> 0:12:31,000
you're welcome

307
0:12:28.81,000 --> 0:12:33,000
instead say I know you'd do the same for

308
0:12:31.42,000 --> 0:12:36,000
me but sometimes it may be helpful to

309
0:12:34.45,000 --> 0:12:38,000
not think in transactional ways to

310
0:12:36.97,000 --> 0:12:4,000
eliminate the transaction to make it a

311
0:12:38.98,000 --> 0:12:42,000
little bit more invisible and in fact if

312
0:12:41.17,000 --> 0:12:46,000
you look in Chinese the word vu coogee

313
0:12:43.9,000 --> 0:12:45,000
in Chinese you're welcome means don't be

314
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
formal

315
0:12:46.78,000 --> 0:12:49,000
we're family we don't need to go through

316
0:12:48.61,000 --> 0:12:53,000
those formalities and come Bali an

317
0:12:50.5,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Indonesian is come back to me when you

318
0:12:54.01,000 --> 0:12:57,000
say you're welcome next time think about

319
0:12:55.66,000 --> 0:12:59,000
how you can maybe sometimes eliminate

320
0:12:57.58,000 --> 0:13:01,000
the transaction and instead strengthen

321
0:12:59.89,000 --> 0:13:03,000
that social tie maybe it's great to

322
0:13:02.32,000 --> 0:13:07,000
collaborate or that's what friends are

323
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
for okay I want you to think about how

324
0:13:08.05,000 --> 0:13:12,000
you think about this ticket that you

325
0:13:10.6,000 --> 0:13:14,000
have to travel your social universe

326
0:13:12.88,000 --> 0:13:16,000
here's one metaphor it's a common

327
0:13:15.55,000 --> 0:13:19,000
metaphor life is a journey right it's a

328
0:13:17.23,000 --> 0:13:2,000
train ride and you're on this train

329
0:13:19.69,000 --> 0:13:22,000
you're a passenger on the train and

330
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
there's certain people with you

331
0:13:22.81,000 --> 0:13:26,000
certain people get on this train and

332
0:13:25.06,000 --> 0:13:28,000
some stay with you some leave at

333
0:13:26.95,000 --> 0:13:3,000
different stops new ones may and

334
0:13:28.81,000 --> 0:13:32,000
I love this metaphor it's a beautiful

335
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:35,000
one but I want you to consider a

336
0:13:32.89,000 --> 0:13:37,000
different metaphor this one is passive

337
0:13:35.08,000 --> 0:13:39,000
being a passenger on that train and it's

338
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
quite linear you're off to some

339
0:13:39.76,000 --> 0:13:45,000
particular destination why not instead

340
0:13:43.24,000 --> 0:13:48,000
think of yourself as an atom bumping up

341
0:13:46.45,000 --> 0:13:5,000
against other atoms maybe transferring

342
0:13:48.94,000 --> 0:13:52,000
energy with them bonding with them a

343
0:13:50.98,000 --> 0:13:54,000
little and maybe creating something new

344
0:13:53.17,000 --> 0:13:58,000
on your travels through the social

345
0:13:55.21,000 --> 0:14:01,000
universe thank you so much and I hope we

346
0:13:58.36,000 --> 0:14:,000
bump into each other again

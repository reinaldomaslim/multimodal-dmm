1
0:00:12.61,000 --> 0:00:14,000
What do you do if you had to figure out the information

2
0:00:15.29,000 --> 0:00:17,000
behind 11.5 million documents,

3
0:00:17.715,000 --> 0:00:18,000
verify it and make sense of it?

4
0:00:20.15,000 --> 0:00:21,000
That was a challenge

5
0:00:21.326,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that a group of journalists had to face late last year.

6
0:00:24.662,000 --> 0:00:27,000
An anonymous person calling himself John Doe

7
0:00:28.122,000 --> 0:00:31,000
had somehow managed to copy nearly 40 years of records

8
0:00:31.198,000 --> 0:00:34,000
of the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.

9
0:00:35.317,000 --> 0:00:37,000
This is one of many firms around the world

10
0:00:38.031,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that specialize in setting up accounts in offshore tax havens

11
0:00:41.586,000 --> 0:00:43,000
like the British Virgin Islands,

12
0:00:43.61,000 --> 0:00:46,000
for rich and powerful people who like to keep secrets.

13
0:00:48.195,000 --> 0:00:51,000
John Doe had managed to copy every spreadsheet from this firm,

14
0:00:51.757,000 --> 0:00:52,000
every client file,

15
0:00:53.375,000 --> 0:00:54,000
every email,

16
0:00:55.098,000 --> 0:00:57,000
from 1977 to the present day.

17
0:00:58.912,000 --> 0:01:,000
It represented the biggest cache

18
0:01:01.251,000 --> 0:01:03,000
of inside information into the tax haven system

19
0:01:04.061,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that anyone had ever seen.

20
0:01:06.092,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But it also presented a gigantic challenge to investigative journalism.

21
0:01:11.87,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Think about it: 11.5 million documents,

22
0:01:16.335,000 --> 0:01:2,000
containing the secrets of people from more than 200 different countries.

23
0:01:20.449,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Where do you start with such a vast resource?

24
0:01:22.95,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Where do you even begin to tell a story

25
0:01:25.053,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that can trail off into every corner of the globe,

26
0:01:28.367,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and that can affect almost any person in any language,

27
0:01:31.436,000 --> 0:01:33,000
sometimes in ways they don't even know yet.

28
0:01:34.513,000 --> 0:01:36,000
John Doe had given the information to two journalists

29
0:01:37.039,000 --> 0:01:39,000
at the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.

30
0:01:40.562,000 --> 0:01:43,000
He said he was motivated by -- and I quote --

31
0:01:43.82,000 --> 0:01:46,000
"The scale of the injustice that the documents would reveal."

32
0:01:48.401,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But one user alone can never make sense

33
0:01:50.408,000 --> 0:01:51,000
of such a vast amount of information.

34
0:01:52.362,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So the Süddeutsche Zeitung reached out

35
0:01:54.248,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to my organization in Washington, DC,

36
0:01:57.016,000 --> 0:02:,000
The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

37
0:02:01.926,000 --> 0:02:03,000
We decided to do something that was the very opposite

38
0:02:04.524,000 --> 0:02:06,000
of everything we'd been taught to do as journalists:

39
0:02:07.289,000 --> 0:02:08,000
share.

40
0:02:08.468,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:10.324,000 --> 0:02:13,000
By nature, investigative reporters are lone wolves.

42
0:02:14.002,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We fiercely guard our secrets,

43
0:02:15.855,000 --> 0:02:16,000
at times even from our editors,

44
0:02:17.413,000 --> 0:02:19,000
because we know that the moment we tell them what we have,

45
0:02:20.297,000 --> 0:02:21,000
they'll want that story right away.

46
0:02:22.691,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And to be frank,

47
0:02:24.607,000 --> 0:02:25,000
when you get a good story,

48
0:02:26.053,000 --> 0:02:28,000
you like to keep the glory to yourself.

49
0:02:29.733,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But there's no doubt that we live in a shrinking world,

50
0:02:32.366,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and that the media has largely been slow to wake up to this.

51
0:02:35.559,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The issues we report on are more and more transnational.

52
0:02:39.135,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Giant corporations operate on a global level.

53
0:02:42.441,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Environmental and health crises are global.

54
0:02:45.758,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So, too, are financial flows and financial crises.

55
0:02:49.488,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So it seems staggering that journalism has been so late

56
0:02:52.516,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to cover stories in a truly global way.

57
0:02:55.783,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And it also seems staggering that journalism has been so slow

58
0:02:58.811,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to wake up to the possibilities that technology brings,

59
0:03:02.244,000 --> 0:03:04,000
rather than being frightened of it.

60
0:03:05.666,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The reason journalists are scared of technology is this:

61
0:03:09.477,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the profession's largest institutions are going through tough times

62
0:03:13.061,000 --> 0:03:16,000
because of the changing way that people are consuming news.

63
0:03:16.958,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The advertising business models that have sustained reporting are broken.

64
0:03:21.89,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And this has plunged journalism into crisis,

65
0:03:24.572,000 --> 0:03:28,000
forcing those institutions to reexamine how they function.

66
0:03:30.258,000 --> 0:03:31,000
But where there is crisis,

67
0:03:31.935,000 --> 0:03:32,000
there is also opportunity.

68
0:03:34.013,000 --> 0:03:35,000
The first challenge presented

69
0:03:35.491,000 --> 0:03:37,000
by what would eventually become known as the Panama Papers

70
0:03:38.363,000 --> 0:03:4,000
was to make the documents searchable and readable.

71
0:03:40.936,000 --> 0:03:42,000
There were nearly five million emails,

72
0:03:43.587,000 --> 0:03:46,000
two million PDFs that needed to be scanned and indexed,

73
0:03:46.924,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and millions more files and other kinds of documents.

74
0:03:50.162,000 --> 0:03:52,000
They all needed to be housed in a safe and secure location

75
0:03:53.023,000 --> 0:03:54,000
in the cloud.

76
0:03:54.961,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We next invited reporters to have a look at the documents.

77
0:03:58.456,000 --> 0:04:01,000
In all, reporters from more than 100 media organizations

78
0:04:02.34,000 --> 0:04:03,000
in 76 countries --

79
0:04:04.433,000 --> 0:04:06,000
from the BBC in Britain

80
0:04:06.502,000 --> 0:04:08,000
to Le Monde newspaper in France

81
0:04:08.742,000 --> 0:04:1,000
to the Asahi Shimbun in Japan.

82
0:04:12.473,000 --> 0:04:15,000
"Native eyes on native names," we called it, the idea being,

83
0:04:16.247,000 --> 0:04:19,000
who best to tell you who was important to Nigeria

84
0:04:19.63,000 --> 0:04:2,000
than a Nigerian journalist?

85
0:04:21.623,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Who best in Canada than a Canadian?

86
0:04:24.247,000 --> 0:04:27,000
There were only two rules for everyone who was invited:

87
0:04:27.327,000 --> 0:04:31,000
we all agreed to share everything that we found with everybody else,

88
0:04:32.335,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and we all agreed to publish together on the same day.

89
0:04:35.769,000 --> 0:04:37,000
We chose our media partners based on trust

90
0:04:37.828,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that had been built up through previous smaller collaborations

91
0:04:41.07,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and also from leads that jumped out from the documents.

92
0:04:44.625,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Over the next few months,

93
0:04:45.884,000 --> 0:04:47,000
my small nonprofit organization of less than 20 people

94
0:04:48.566,000 --> 0:04:52,000
was joined by more than 350 other reporters from 25 language groups.

95
0:04:54.035,000 --> 0:04:55,000
The biggest information leak in history

96
0:04:55.981,000 --> 0:04:58,000
had now spawned the biggest journalism collaboration in history:

97
0:05:00.091,000 --> 0:05:06,000
376 sets of native eyes doing what journalists normally never do,

98
0:05:06.203,000 --> 0:05:07,000
working shoulder to shoulder,

99
0:05:07.838,000 --> 0:05:08,000
sharing information,

100
0:05:09.488,000 --> 0:05:1,000
but telling no one.

101
0:05:12.102,000 --> 0:05:13,000
For it became clear at this point

102
0:05:13.725,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that in order to make the biggest kind of noise,

103
0:05:16.106,000 --> 0:05:19,000
we first needed the biggest kind of silence.

104
0:05:20.49,000 --> 0:05:22,000
To manage the project over the many months it would take,

105
0:05:23.244,000 --> 0:05:24,000
we built a secure virtual newsroom.

106
0:05:25.085,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We used encrypted communication systems,

107
0:05:28.157,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and we built a specially designed search engine.

108
0:05:30.871,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Inside the virtual newsroom,

109
0:05:32.522,000 --> 0:05:34,000
the reporters could gather around the themes

110
0:05:34.633,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that were emerging from the documents.

111
0:05:36.638,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Those interested in blood diamonds or exotic art, for instance,

112
0:05:41.968,000 --> 0:05:44,000
could share information about how the offshore world was being used

113
0:05:45.182,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to hide the trade in both of those commodities.

114
0:05:47.413,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Those interested in sport could share information

115
0:05:49.877,000 --> 0:05:52,000
about how famous sports stars were putting their image rights

116
0:05:53.166,000 --> 0:05:54,000
into offshore companies,

117
0:05:54.714,000 --> 0:05:56,000
thereby likely avoiding taxes

118
0:05:57.001,000 --> 0:05:59,000
in the countries where they plied their trade.

119
0:06:00.097,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But perhaps most exciting of all

120
0:06:01.909,000 --> 0:06:04,000
were the number of world leaders and elect politicians

121
0:06:05.41,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that were emerging from the documents --

122
0:06:08.54,000 --> 0:06:11,000
figures like Petro Poroshenko in Ukraine,

123
0:06:12.824,000 --> 0:06:15,000
close associates of Vladimir Putin in Russia

124
0:06:17.852,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, who is linked

125
0:06:21.033,000 --> 0:06:23,000
through his late father, Ian Cameron.

126
0:06:24.529,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Buried in the documents were secret offshore entities,

127
0:06:27.784,000 --> 0:06:28,000
such as Wintris Inc.,

128
0:06:30.427,000 --> 0:06:31,000
a company in the British Virgin Islands

129
0:06:32.327,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that had actually belonged to the sitting Icelandic prime minister.

130
0:06:36.435,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I like to refer to Johannes Kristjansson,

131
0:06:38.87,000 --> 0:06:4,000
the Icelandic reporter we invited to join the project,

132
0:06:41.811,000 --> 0:06:42,000
as the loneliest man in the world.

133
0:06:44.231,000 --> 0:06:46,000
For nine months, he refused paid work

134
0:06:46.544,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and lived off the earnings of his wife.

135
0:06:49.308,000 --> 0:06:51,000
He pasted tarps over the windows of his home

136
0:06:51.415,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to prevent prying eyes during the long Icelandic winter.

137
0:06:55.505,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And he soon ran out of excuses to explain his many absences,

138
0:06:59.327,000 --> 0:07:,000
as he worked red-eyed,

139
0:07:00.917,000 --> 0:07:01,000
night after night,

140
0:07:02.147,000 --> 0:07:03,000
month after month.

141
0:07:03.972,000 --> 0:07:05,000
In all that time, he sat on information

142
0:07:06.344,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that would eventually bring down the leader of his country.

143
0:07:10.1,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Now, when you're an investigative reporter and you make an amazing discovery,

144
0:07:13.813,000 --> 0:07:16,000
such as your prime minster can be linked to a secret offshore company,

145
0:07:17.718,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that that company has a financial interest in Icelandic banks --

146
0:07:21.868,000 --> 0:07:23,000
the very issue he's been elected on --

147
0:07:24.242,000 --> 0:07:26,000
well, your instinct is to scream out very loud.

148
0:07:28.044,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Instead, as one of the few people that he could speak to,

149
0:07:30.962,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Johannes and I shared a kind of gallows humor.

150
0:07:34.391,000 --> 0:07:35,000
"Wintris is coming," he used to say.

151
0:07:36.136,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Laughter)

152
0:07:37.689,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Applause)

153
0:07:41.314,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We were big fans of "Game of Thrones."

154
0:07:44.759,000 --> 0:07:47,000
When reporters like Johannes wanted to scream,

155
0:07:47.919,000 --> 0:07:49,000
they did so inside the virtual newsroom,

156
0:07:50.618,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and then they turned those screams into stories

157
0:07:52.861,000 --> 0:07:55,000
by going outside the documents to court records,

158
0:07:56.479,000 --> 0:07:57,000
official company registers,

159
0:07:58.163,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and by eventually putting questions to those that we intended to name.

160
0:08:03.178,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Panama Papers actually allowed the reporters to look at the world

161
0:08:07.234,000 --> 0:08:09,000
through a different lens from everybody else.

162
0:08:09.874,000 --> 0:08:1,000
As we were researching the story,

163
0:08:11.818,000 --> 0:08:12,000
unconnected to us,

164
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
a major political bribery scandal happened in Brazil.

165
0:08:17.339,000 --> 0:08:19,000
A new leader was elected in Argentina.

166
0:08:20.608,000 --> 0:08:23,000
The FBI began to indict officials at FIFA,

167
0:08:24.523,000 --> 0:08:27,000
the organization that controls the world of professional soccer.

168
0:08:29.089,000 --> 0:08:31,000
The Panama Papers actually had unique insights

169
0:08:31.39,000 --> 0:08:33,000
into each one of these unfolding events.

170
0:08:33.66,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So you can imagine the pressure and the ego dramas

171
0:08:37.124,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that could have ruined what we were trying to do.

172
0:08:39.637,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Any of one of these journalists,

173
0:08:41.199,000 --> 0:08:42,000
they could have broken the pact.

174
0:08:42.944,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But they didn't.

175
0:08:44.464,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And on April 3 this year,

176
0:08:46.056,000 --> 0:08:48,000
at exactly 8pm German time,

177
0:08:48.261,000 --> 0:08:51,000
we published simultaneously in 76 countries.

178
0:08:52.22,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Applause)

179
0:09:03.64,000 --> 0:09:06,000
The Panama Papers quickly became one of the biggest stories of the year.

180
0:09:07.276,000 --> 0:09:1,000
This is the scene in Iceland the day after we published.

181
0:09:10.504,000 --> 0:09:12,000
It was the first of many protests.

182
0:09:13.047,000 --> 0:09:15,000
The Icelandic prime minister had to resign.

183
0:09:15.431,000 --> 0:09:17,000
It was a first of many resignations.

184
0:09:18.275,000 --> 0:09:21,000
We spotlighted many famous people such as Lionel Messi,

185
0:09:21.862,000 --> 0:09:23,000
the most famous soccer player in the world.

186
0:09:24.726,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And there were some unintended consequences.

187
0:09:27.454,000 --> 0:09:3,000
These alleged members of a Mexican drug cartel were arrested

188
0:09:31.155,000 --> 0:09:33,000
after we published details about their hideout.

189
0:09:34.615,000 --> 0:09:35,000
They'd been using the address

190
0:09:36.579,000 --> 0:09:37,000
to register their offshore company.

191
0:09:38.573,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Laughter)

192
0:09:43.091,000 --> 0:09:45,000
There's a kind of irony in what we've been able to do.

193
0:09:45.676,000 --> 0:09:48,000
The technology -- the Internet -- that has broken the business model

194
0:09:49.406,000 --> 0:09:51,000
is allowing us to reinvent journalism itself.

195
0:09:52.516,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And this dynamic is producing

196
0:09:54.228,000 --> 0:09:56,000
unprecedented levels of transparency and impact.

197
0:09:57.772,000 --> 0:10:,000
We showed how a group of journalists can effect change across the world

198
0:10:01.282,000 --> 0:10:04,000
by applying new methods and old-fashioned journalism techniques

199
0:10:05.286,000 --> 0:10:07,000
to vast amounts of leaked information.

200
0:10:08.319,000 --> 0:10:12,000
We put all-important context around what was given to us by John Doe.

201
0:10:13.205,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And by sharing resources,

202
0:10:14.814,000 --> 0:10:15,000
we were able to dig deep --

203
0:10:16.527,000 --> 0:10:2,000
much deeper and longer than most media organizations allow these days,

204
0:10:20.926,000 --> 0:10:21,000
because of financial concerns.

205
0:10:23.5,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Now, it was a big risk,

206
0:10:25.107,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and it wouldn't work for every story,

207
0:10:27.119,000 --> 0:10:29,000
but we showed with the Panama Papers

208
0:10:29.147,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that you can write about any country from just about anywhere,

209
0:10:32.109,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and then choose your preferred battleground to defend your work.

210
0:10:36.195,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Try obtaining a court injunction

211
0:10:37.794,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that would prevent the telling of a story in 76 different countries.

212
0:10:42.377,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Try stopping the inevitable.

213
0:10:45.353,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Shortly after we published, I got a three-word text from Johannes:

214
0:10:49.804,000 --> 0:10:51,000
"Wintris has arrived."

215
0:10:52.046,000 --> 0:10:53,000
(Laughter)

216
0:10:53.468,000 --> 0:10:56,000
It had arrived and so, too, perhaps has a new era for journalism.

217
0:10:57.673,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Thank you.

218
0:10:58.853,000 --> 0:11:04,000
(Applause)

219
0:11:09.612,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Bruno Giussani: Gerard, thank you.

220
0:11:11.296,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I guess you're going to send that applause to the 350 journalists

221
0:11:14.395,000 --> 0:11:15,000
who worked with you, right?

222
0:11:15.997,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Now, a couple of questions I would like to ask.

223
0:11:18.232,000 --> 0:11:19,000
The first one is,

224
0:11:19.423,000 --> 0:11:21,000
you'd been working in secrecy for over a year

225
0:11:22.115,000 --> 0:11:25,000
with 350-something colleagues from all over the world --

226
0:11:25.765,000 --> 0:11:28,000
was there ever a moment when you thought

227
0:11:29.12,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that the leak may be leaked,

228
0:11:31.272,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that the collaboration may just be broken

229
0:11:33.999,000 --> 0:11:34,000
by somebody publishing a story?

230
0:11:35.602,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Or somebody not in the group releasing some information

231
0:11:38.444,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that they got to know?

232
0:11:40.228,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Gerard Ryle: We had a series of crises along the way,

233
0:11:42.904,000 --> 0:11:44,000
including when something major was happening in the world,

234
0:11:45.659,000 --> 0:11:48,000
the journalists from that country wanted to publish right away.

235
0:11:48.706,000 --> 0:11:49,000
We had to calm them down.

236
0:11:49.939,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Probably the biggest crisis we had was a week before publication.

237
0:11:53.107,000 --> 0:11:57,000
We'd sent a series of questions to the associates of Vladimir Putin,

238
0:11:57.142,000 --> 0:11:58,000
but instead of responding,

239
0:11:58.659,000 --> 0:12:,000
the Kremlin actually held a press conference and denounced us,

240
0:12:01.646,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and denounced the whole thing as being, I guess, a plot from the West.

241
0:12:05.087,000 --> 0:12:08,000
At that point, Putin thought it was just about him.

242
0:12:08.127,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And, of course, a lot of editors around the world

243
0:12:10.655,000 --> 0:12:11,000
were very nervous about this.

244
0:12:12.38,000 --> 0:12:14,000
They thought the story was going to get out.

245
0:12:14.467,000 --> 0:12:16,000
You can imagine the amount of time they'd spent,

246
0:12:16.744,000 --> 0:12:18,000
the amount of resources, money spent on this.

247
0:12:18.927,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So I had to basically spend the last week calming everyone down,

248
0:12:21.988,000 --> 0:12:23,000
a bit like a general, where you're holding your troops back:

249
0:12:24.894,000 --> 0:12:25,000
"Calm, remain calm."

250
0:12:26.218,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And then eventually, of course, they all did.

251
0:12:29.323,000 --> 0:12:31,000
BG: And then a couple weeks ago or so,

252
0:12:31.815,000 --> 0:12:34,000
you released a lot of the documents as an open database

253
0:12:35.808,000 --> 0:12:37,000
for everybody to search via keyword, essentially.

254
0:12:39.029,000 --> 0:12:4,000
GR: We very much believe

255
0:12:40.218,000 --> 0:12:42,000
that the basic information about the offshore world

256
0:12:42.644,000 --> 0:12:43,000
should be made public.

257
0:12:43.821,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Now, we didn't publish the underlying documents

258
0:12:46.722,000 --> 0:12:47,000
of the journalists we're working with.

259
0:12:48.611,000 --> 0:12:5,000
But the basic information such as the name of a person,

260
0:12:51.217,000 --> 0:12:53,000
what their offshore company was and the name of that company,

261
0:12:54.165,000 --> 0:12:55,000
is now all available online.

262
0:12:55.545,000 --> 0:12:58,000
In fact, the biggest resource of its kind basically is out there now

263
0:13:00.374,000 --> 0:13:01,000
BG: Gerard, thank you for the work you do.

264
0:13:02.271,000 --> 0:13:03,000
GR: Thank you.

265
0:13:03.453,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Applause)

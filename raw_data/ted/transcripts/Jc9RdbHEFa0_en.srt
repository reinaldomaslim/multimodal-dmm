0:00:15.709,000 --> 0:00:16,000
My passions

3
0:00:16.742,000 --> 0:00:19,000
are music, technology and making things.

4
0:00:20.431,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And it's the combination of these things

5
0:00:23.614,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that has led me to the hobby of sound visualization,

6
0:00:26.31,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and, on occasion, has led me to play with fire.

7
0:00:30.388,000 --> 0:00:32,000
This is a Rubens' tube. It's one of many I've made over the years,

8
0:00:32.765,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and I have one here tonight.

9
0:00:34.511,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It's about an 8-foot-long tube of metal,

10
0:00:36.036,000 --> 0:00:37,000
it's got a hundred or so holes on top,

11
0:00:37.371,000 --> 0:00:38,000
on that side is the speaker, and here

12
0:00:39.124,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is some lab tubing, and it's connected to this tank

13
0:00:41.3,000 --> 0:00:42,000
of propane.

14
0:00:44.347,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So, let's fire it up and see what it does.

15
0:00:53.147,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So let's play a 550-herz frequency

16
0:00:55.038,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and watch what happens.

17
0:00:56.602,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Frequency)

18
0:01:05.085,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Thank you. (Applause)

19
0:01:07.798,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It's okay to applaud the laws of physics,

20
0:01:09.786,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but essentially what's happening here

21
0:01:11.242,000 --> 0:01:12,000
-- (Laughter) --

22
0:01:13.002,000 --> 0:01:17,000
is the energy from the sound via the air and gas molecules

23
0:01:17.01,000 --> 0:01:19,000
is influencing the combustion properties of propane,

24
0:01:19.514,000 --> 0:01:2,000
creating a visible waveform,

25
0:01:21.418,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and we can see the alternating regions of compression

26
0:01:23.738,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and rarefaction that we call frequency,

27
0:01:25.778,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and the height is showing us amplitude.

28
0:01:27.522,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So let's change the frequency of the sound,

29
0:01:29.85,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and watch what happens to the fire.

30
0:01:31.275,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Higher frequency)

31
0:01:41.405,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So every time we hit a resonant frequency we get a standing wave

32
0:01:44.755,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and that emergent sine curve of fire.

33
0:01:46.455,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So let's turn that off. We're indoors.

34
0:01:48.033,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Thank you. (Applause)

35
0:01:53.624,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I also have with me a flame table.

36
0:01:55.971,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It's very similar to a Rubens' tube, and it's also used

37
0:01:57.536,000 --> 0:01:59,000
for visualizing the physical properties of sound,

38
0:01:59.657,000 --> 0:02:,000
such as eigenmodes, so let's fire it up

39
0:02:01.625,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and see what it does.

40
0:02:07.552,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Ooh. (Laughter)

41
0:02:12.02,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Okay. Now, while the table comes up to pressure,

42
0:02:14.994,000 --> 0:02:15,000
let me note here that the sound is not traveling

43
0:02:16.666,000 --> 0:02:18,000
in perfect lines. It's actually traveling in all directions,

44
0:02:19.412,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and the Rubens' tube's a little like bisecting those waves

45
0:02:22.521,000 --> 0:02:23,000
with a line, and the flame table's a little like

46
0:02:24.517,000 --> 0:02:25,000
bisecting those waves with a plane,

47
0:02:26.371,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and it can show a little more subtle complexity, which is why

48
0:02:30.371,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I like to use it to watch Geoff Farina play guitar.

49
0:02:32.724,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Music)

50
0:03:15.005,000 --> 0:03:16,000
All right, so it's a delicate dance.

51
0:03:16.77,000 --> 0:03:18,000
If you watch closely — (Applause)

52
0:03:19.315,000 --> 0:03:21,000
If you watch closely, you may have seen

53
0:03:22.082,000 --> 0:03:24,000
some of the eigenmodes, but also you may have seen

54
0:03:24.554,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that jazz music is better with fire.

55
0:03:29.171,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Actually, a lot of things are better with fire in my world,

56
0:03:31.181,000 --> 0:03:33,000
but the fire's just a foundation.

57
0:03:33.613,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It shows very well that eyes can hear,

58
0:03:34.761,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and this is interesting to me because

59
0:03:36.156,000 --> 0:03:38,000
technology allows us to present sound to the eyes

60
0:03:39.01,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes

61
0:03:41.873,000 --> 0:03:43,000
for seeing sound, such as the removal of time.

62
0:03:44.57,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So here, I'm using a rendering algorithm to paint

63
0:03:47.954,000 --> 0:03:49,000
the frequencies of the song "Smells Like Teen Spirit"

64
0:03:50.417,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in a way that the eyes can take them in

65
0:03:52.457,000 --> 0:03:54,000
as a single visual impression, and the technique

66
0:03:54.701,000 --> 0:03:55,000
will also show the strengths of the visual cortex

67
0:03:56.674,000 --> 0:03:57,000
for pattern recognition.

68
0:03:58.29,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So if I show you another song off this album,

69
0:04:00.169,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and another, your eyes will easily pick out

70
0:04:03.65,000 --> 0:04:05,000
the use of repetition by the band Nirvana,

71
0:04:06.578,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and in the frequency distribution, the colors,

72
0:04:08.435,000 --> 0:04:11,000
you can see the clean-dirty-clean sound

73
0:04:11.483,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that they are famous for,

74
0:04:12.69,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and here is the entire album as a single visual impression,

75
0:04:16.69,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and I think this impression is pretty powerful.

76
0:04:18.57,000 --> 0:04:19,000
At least, it's powerful enough that

77
0:04:20.284,000 --> 0:04:21,000
if I show you these four songs,

78
0:04:21.626,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and I remind you that this is "Smells Like Teen Spirit,"

79
0:04:24.067,000 --> 0:04:26,000
you can probably correctly guess, without listening

80
0:04:26.386,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to any music at all, that the song

81
0:04:27.82,000 --> 0:04:29,000
a die hard Nirvana fan would enjoy is this song,

82
0:04:30.114,000 --> 0:04:32,000
"I'll Stick Around" by the Foo Fighters,

83
0:04:32.37,000 --> 0:04:34,000
whose lead singer is Dave Grohl,

84
0:04:34.37,000 --> 0:04:37,000
who was the drummer in Nirvana.

85
0:04:38.148,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The songs are a little similar, but mostly

86
0:04:39.448,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I'm just interested in the idea that someday maybe

87
0:04:41.074,000 --> 0:04:45,000
we'll buy a song because we like the way it looks.

88
0:04:45.486,000 --> 0:04:46,000
All right, now for some more sound data.

89
0:04:46.586,000 --> 0:04:48,000
This is data from a skate park,

90
0:04:49.238,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and this is Mabel Davis skate park

91
0:04:51.27,000 --> 0:04:53,000
in Austin, Texas. (Skateboard sounds)

92
0:04:53.412,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And the sounds you're hearing came from eight

93
0:04:54.786,000 --> 0:04:56,000
microphones attached to obstacles around the park,

94
0:04:57.002,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and it sounds like chaos, but actually

95
0:04:59.186,000 --> 0:05:02,000
all the tricks start with a very distinct slap,

96
0:05:02.533,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but successful tricks end with a pop,

97
0:05:04.137,000 --> 0:05:05,000
whereas unsuccessful tricks

98
0:05:05.93,000 --> 0:05:06,000
more of a scratch and a tumble,

99
0:05:07.786,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and tricks on the rail will ring out like a gong, and

100
0:05:11.796,000 --> 0:05:13,000
voices occupy very unique frequencies in the skate park.

101
0:05:14.586,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So if we were to render these sounds visually,

102
0:05:16.524,000 --> 0:05:17,000
we might end up with something like this.

103
0:05:17.931,000 --> 0:05:19,000
This is all 40 minutes of the recording,

104
0:05:20.387,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and right away the algorithm tells us

105
0:05:22.547,000 --> 0:05:24,000
a lot more tricks are missed than are made,

106
0:05:24.62,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and also a trick on the rails is a lot more likely

107
0:05:26.955,000 --> 0:05:28,000
to produce a cheer, and if you look really closely,

108
0:05:29.827,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we can tease out traffic patterns.

109
0:05:31.56,000 --> 0:05:37,000
You see the skaters often trick in this direction. The obstacles are easier.

110
0:05:37.647,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And in the middle of the recording, the mics pick this up,

111
0:05:39.352,000 --> 0:05:41,000
but later in the recording, this kid shows up,

112
0:05:42.156,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and he starts using a line at the top of the park

113
0:05:45.084,000 --> 0:05:46,000
to do some very advanced tricks on something

114
0:05:46.886,000 --> 0:05:47,000
called the tall rail.

115
0:05:47.989,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And it's fascinating. At this moment in time,

116
0:05:49.861,000 --> 0:05:52,000
all the rest of the skaters turn their lines 90 degrees

117
0:05:53.364,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to stay out of his way.

118
0:05:55.142,000 --> 0:05:57,000
You see, there's a subtle etiquette in the skate park,

119
0:05:57.685,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and it's led by key influencers,

120
0:05:59.285,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and they tend to be the kids who can do the best tricks,

121
0:06:02.533,000 --> 0:06:04,000
or wear red pants, and on this day the mics picked that up.

122
0:06:04.963,000 --> 0:06:07,000
All right, from skate physics to theoretical physics.

123
0:06:08.864,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I'm a big fan of Stephen Hawking,

124
0:06:10.48,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and I wanted to use all eight hours

125
0:06:11.816,000 --> 0:06:13,000
of his Cambridge lecture series to create an homage.

126
0:06:14.403,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Now, in this series he's speaking with the aid of a computer,

127
0:06:17.467,000 --> 0:06:2,000
which actually makes identifying the ends of sentences

128
0:06:20.571,000 --> 0:06:23,000
fairly easy. So I wrote a steering algorithm.

129
0:06:23.997,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It listens to the lecture, and then it uses

130
0:06:25.957,000 --> 0:06:27,000
the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x-axis,

131
0:06:28.644,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and it uses the inflection of sentences

132
0:06:31.277,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to move a same point up and down on the y-axis.

133
0:06:33.431,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And these trend lines, you can see, there's more questions

134
0:06:36.205,000 --> 0:06:37,000
than answers in the laws of physics,

135
0:06:38.075,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and when we reach the end of a sentence,

136
0:06:40.108,000 --> 0:06:42,000
we place a star at that location.

137
0:06:42.443,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So there's a lot of sentences, so a lot of stars,

138
0:06:45.243,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and after rendering all of the audio, this is what we get.

139
0:06:47.599,000 --> 0:06:49,000
This is Stephen Hawking's universe.

140
0:06:50.528,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Applause)

141
0:06:57.465,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It's all eight hours of the Cambridge lecture series

142
0:06:59.952,000 --> 0:07:,000
taken in as a single visual impression,

143
0:07:01.8,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and I really like this image,

144
0:07:03.557,000 --> 0:07:04,000
but a lot of people think it's fake.

145
0:07:05.365,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So I made a more interactive version,

146
0:07:07.709,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and the way I did that is I used their position in time

147
0:07:13.165,000 --> 0:07:15,000
in the lecture to place these stars into 3D space,

148
0:07:15.532,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and with some custom software and a Kinect,

149
0:07:17.933,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I can walk right into the lecture.

150
0:07:20.596,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I'm going to wave through the Kinect here

151
0:07:22.396,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and take control, and now I'm going to reach out

152
0:07:24.228,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and I'm going to touch a star, and when I do,

153
0:07:27.467,000 --> 0:07:28,000
it will play the sentence

154
0:07:29.411,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that generated that star.

155
0:07:30.876,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Stephen Hawking: There is one, and only one, arrangement

156
0:07:34.692,000 --> 0:07:36,000
in which the pieces make a complete picture.

157
0:07:37.491,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Jared Ficklin: Thank you. (Applause)

158
0:07:41.639,000 --> 0:07:44,000
There are 1,400 stars.

159
0:07:44.812,000 --> 0:07:45,000
It's a really fun way to explore the lecture,

160
0:07:46.476,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and, I hope, a fitting homage.

161
0:07:47.943,000 --> 0:07:52,000
All right. Let me close with a work in progress.

162
0:07:53.415,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I think, after 30 years, the opportunity exists

163
0:07:56.398,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to create an enhanced version of closed captioning.

164
0:07:58.502,000 --> 0:08:,000
Now, we've all seen a lot of TEDTalks online,

165
0:08:00.621,000 --> 0:08:02,000
so let's watch one now with the sound turned off

166
0:08:03.548,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and the closed captioning turned on.

167
0:08:07.47,000 --> 0:08:09,000
There's no closed captioning for the TED theme song,

168
0:08:09.616,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and we're missing it, but if you've watched enough of these,

169
0:08:11.729,000 --> 0:08:12,000
you hear it in your mind's ear,

170
0:08:13.098,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and then applause starts.

171
0:08:16.081,000 --> 0:08:18,000
It usually begins here, and it grows and then it falls.

172
0:08:18.271,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Sometimes you get a little star applause,

173
0:08:20.248,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and then I think even Bill Gates takes a nervous breath,

174
0:08:22.734,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and the talk begins.

175
0:08:24.424,000 --> 0:08:29,000
All right, so let's watch this clip again.

176
0:08:30.122,000 --> 0:08:31,000
This time, I'm not going to talk at all.

177
0:08:31.378,000 --> 0:08:32,000
There's still going to be no audio,

178
0:08:32.745,000 --> 0:08:33,000
but what I am going to do is I'm going to render the sound

179
0:08:34.649,000 --> 0:08:38,000
visually in real time at the bottom of the screen.

180
0:08:38.965,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So watch closely and see what your eyes can hear.

181
0:09:03.14,000 --> 0:09:04,000
This is fairly amazing to me.

182
0:09:05.02,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Even on the first view, your eyes will successfully

183
0:09:08.353,000 --> 0:09:11,000
pick out patterns, but on repeated views,

184
0:09:11.441,000 --> 0:09:12,000
your brain actually gets better

185
0:09:13.13,000 --> 0:09:14,000
at turning these patterns into information.

186
0:09:14.786,000 --> 0:09:15,000
You can get the tone and the timbre

187
0:09:16.377,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and the pace of the speech,

188
0:09:17.6,000 --> 0:09:19,000
things that you can't get out of closed captioning.

189
0:09:19.664,000 --> 0:09:21,000
That famous scene in horror movies

190
0:09:21.848,000 --> 0:09:23,000
where someone is walking up from behind

191
0:09:24.496,000 --> 0:09:25,000
is something you can see,

192
0:09:26.456,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and I believe this information would be something

193
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that is useful at times when the audio is turned off

194
0:09:31.963,000 --> 0:09:33,000
or not heard at all, and I speculate that deaf audiences

195
0:09:34.904,000 --> 0:09:35,000
might actually even be better

196
0:09:36.081,000 --> 0:09:37,000
at seeing sound than hearing audiences.

197
0:09:37.862,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I don't know. It's a theory right now.

198
0:09:39.36,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Actually, it's all just an idea.

199
0:09:40.881,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And let me end by saying that sound moves in all directions,

200
0:09:45.072,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and so do ideas.

201
0:09:47.049,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Thank you. (Applause)

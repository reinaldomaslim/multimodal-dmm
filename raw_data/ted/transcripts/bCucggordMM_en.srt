2
0:00:13.317,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I have to admit that it's a lot of fun

3
0:00:15.182,000 --> 0:00:16,000
when people ask me what I do for my job,

4
0:00:17.171,000 --> 0:00:19,000
because I tell them I literally rub things together.

5
0:00:20.524,000 --> 0:00:21,000
This sounds ridiculous,

6
0:00:22.257,000 --> 0:00:24,000
just rubbing things together.

7
0:00:25.403,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But it has a technical name:

8
0:00:28.917,000 --> 0:00:29,000
tribology.

9
0:00:30.332,000 --> 0:00:33,000
T-r-i-b-o-l-o-g-y,

10
0:00:33.893,000 --> 0:00:34,000
from the ancient Greek word "tribos,"

11
0:00:35.738,000 --> 0:00:36,000
which means "to rub."

12
0:00:37.835,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It's a funny-sounding word you've probably never heard before,

13
0:00:40.794,000 --> 0:00:41,000
but I promise you,

14
0:00:41.972,000 --> 0:00:44,000
discovering it changes your experience with the physical world.

15
0:00:45.467,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Tribology has given me amazing projects.

16
0:00:48.256,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I've worked on materials that fly, and I've worked on dog food --

17
0:00:52.228,000 --> 0:00:55,000
a combination that doesn't sound like one person has any business doing

18
0:00:55.685,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in the span of just a couple years,

19
0:00:57.858,000 --> 0:01:,000
until you start to view the world through a tribological lens.

20
0:01:02.005,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And I think you'll be surprised

21
0:01:03.755,000 --> 0:01:06,000
at how significant a little bit of tribology can be

22
0:01:07.04,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in alleviating some very large problems.

23
0:01:11.211,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Tribology is the study of friction, wear and lubrication.

24
0:01:15.83,000 --> 0:01:17,000
You have all experienced all three of these things.

25
0:01:19.039,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Remember the last time you tried to move a heavy object across the floor,

26
0:01:22.522,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and you could just feel something resisting you?

27
0:01:25.206,000 --> 0:01:26,000
That would be friction.

28
0:01:26.907,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Friction is the force that opposes motion.

29
0:01:30.237,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Wear is the loss or transfer of material.

30
0:01:33.021,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It's the reason you have to replace your favorite shoes,

31
0:01:35.697,000 --> 0:01:36,000
because eventually the soles disappear.

32
0:01:38.146,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Lubricants are used to reduce friction and wear.

33
0:01:40.459,000 --> 0:01:43,000
They loosen up those stubborn rusted bolts that just otherwise will not budge.

34
0:01:45.592,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But tribology is also defined as the science of interacting surfaces

35
0:01:49.27,000 --> 0:01:5,000
in relative motion.

36
0:01:51.559,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So, interacting surfaces in relative motion:

37
0:01:57.456,000 --> 0:01:58,000
there are a lot of those in the world.

38
0:01:59.363,000 --> 0:02:02,000
As you're sitting there right now, are you wiggling your foot at all

39
0:02:02.601,000 --> 0:02:03,000
or maybe shifting around in your seat?

40
0:02:04.45,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Because guess what? Tribology is happening.

41
0:02:06.734,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Even the smallest shift in your seat

42
0:02:08.852,000 --> 0:02:1,000
involves two surfaces moving relative to each other.

43
0:02:12.435,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And your tribological interaction for the shift

44
0:02:14.727,000 --> 0:02:16,000
will be different than the person next to you.

45
0:02:16.943,000 --> 0:02:18,000
This is because the clothes you're wearing

46
0:02:18.988,000 --> 0:02:2,000
change the friction between you and the seat.

47
0:02:21.269,000 --> 0:02:24,000
If you're wearing silk, it's a little easier to squirm around in the seat

48
0:02:24.765,000 --> 0:02:25,000
than if you're wearing wool.

49
0:02:26.132,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That's because the friction is lower for silk.

50
0:02:29.139,000 --> 0:02:31,000
If you're moving your ankle or wiggling your ankle at all,

51
0:02:31.957,000 --> 0:02:32,000
did it make a popping sound?

52
0:02:34.458,000 --> 0:02:35,000
You've had that, right?

53
0:02:35.64,000 --> 0:02:37,000
You get up, you move around, and some joint cracks or pops.

54
0:02:38.458,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Thank you for that sound, tribology.

55
0:02:41.875,000 --> 0:02:43,000
That sound can come from the fluid that lubricates your joints

56
0:02:44.811,000 --> 0:02:45,000
just moving around.

57
0:02:46.053,000 --> 0:02:48,000
You're essentially releasing gas bubbles in that fluid.

58
0:02:49.524,000 --> 0:02:52,000
That sound can also come from the tendons simply moving over each other.

59
0:02:53.268,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Pretty common in the ankle,

60
0:02:55.026,000 --> 0:02:57,000
so any of my fellow foot-wigglers out there

61
0:02:57.061,000 --> 0:03:,000
may suddenly find themselves curious about the tribology of tendons.

62
0:03:02.596,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But how does one become a tribologist like me?

63
0:03:06.501,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It starts when you're a kid, of course.

64
0:03:08.637,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I was a ballerina growing up.

65
0:03:10.269,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I reached the level where I was dancing on my toes,

66
0:03:12.923,000 --> 0:03:13,000
or "en pointe."

67
0:03:14.816,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Now, when you're dancing en pointe, you're wearing those amazing shoes,

68
0:03:18.261,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but they can be slippery on the stage.

69
0:03:20.657,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The last thing you want to do when you're trying to dance on your toes

70
0:03:24.003,000 --> 0:03:25,000
is to slip and fall.

71
0:03:25.237,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So we had boxes of stuff called rosin.

72
0:03:27.779,000 --> 0:03:3,000
We would step into the rosin, put a light coating on our shoes.

73
0:03:31.366,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Rosin comes from tree sap

74
0:03:32.868,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and, in its powdered form, makes things less slippery.

75
0:03:37.124,000 --> 0:03:38,000
You learned real fast as a dancer

76
0:03:38.756,000 --> 0:03:4,000
how much was the right amount to put on your shoes,

77
0:03:41.19,000 --> 0:03:44,000
because if you didn't put enough on, you were probably going to slip

78
0:03:44.413,000 --> 0:03:46,000
due to the low friction between your shoe and the stage.

79
0:03:47.262,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Best case scenario,

80
0:03:48.476,000 --> 0:03:5,000
you're the clumsy ballerina on stage,

81
0:03:50.969,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but the worst case scenario would be an injury.

82
0:03:55.095,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Already, I was optimizing and manipulating friction.

83
0:03:59.467,000 --> 0:04:01,000
You see, I was destined to be a tribologist.

84
0:04:02.442,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Laughter)

85
0:04:04.6,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But you were also a junior tribologist.

86
0:04:07.927,000 --> 0:04:08,000
When you used crayons or colored pencils,

87
0:04:09.95,000 --> 0:04:11,000
you knew that the harder you pressed, the darker the color.

88
0:04:13.424,000 --> 0:04:15,000
You also knew this meant you were going to have to sharpen

89
0:04:16.233,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that crayon or colored pencil more frequently,

90
0:04:18.455,000 --> 0:04:19,000
because it was wearing down faster.

91
0:04:20.83,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Now let's talk about those enticing shiny waxed floors

92
0:04:23.544,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that you just had to slide across.

93
0:04:26.448,000 --> 0:04:27,000
You knew if you put on a pair of socks,

94
0:04:28.358,000 --> 0:04:3,000
you were going to get a really good slide across that floor.

95
0:04:31.203,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Good luck trying to do that barefoot.

96
0:04:33.273,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Master manipulators of friction.

97
0:04:38.395,000 --> 0:04:39,000
All kids are tribologists.

98
0:04:39.921,000 --> 0:04:4,000
What about us as adults?

99
0:04:42.607,000 --> 0:04:44,000
At some point today, you brushed your teeth.

100
0:04:45.659,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I hope.

101
0:04:46.835,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:48.119,000 --> 0:04:49,000
This is tribology in action.

103
0:04:50.165,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The toothpaste and toothbrush are working to remove or wear

104
0:04:53.022,000 --> 0:04:54,000
the plaque from your teeth.

105
0:04:55.561,000 --> 0:04:57,000
For the record, my dad is a dentist.

106
0:04:57.764,000 --> 0:05:,000
Never thought my career was going to circle back to the family business.

107
0:05:01.197,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But one day, we found ourselves speaking the same language

108
0:05:04.006,000 --> 0:05:07,000
when I was tasked with developing a test to investigate plaque removal.

109
0:05:08.087,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Sounded simple enough,

110
0:05:10.136,000 --> 0:05:12,000
until I started to look at it as a tribologist,

111
0:05:12.529,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and then it became incredibly complex.

112
0:05:14.941,000 --> 0:05:16,000
You have hard materials -- those would be your teeth --

113
0:05:17.656,000 --> 0:05:2,000
soft materials like your gums, the toothpaste, the toothbrush.

114
0:05:21.297,000 --> 0:05:24,000
There's lubrication -- the form of saliva and water --

115
0:05:24.364,000 --> 0:05:26,000
the dynamics of the person doing the brushing and more.

116
0:05:27.885,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I promise if we put diamonds in your toothpaste,

117
0:05:30.865,000 --> 0:05:31,000
you're going to remove that plaque.

118
0:05:33.208,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Probably going to remove your teeth as well.

119
0:05:35.909,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So there's a fine balance to be had between wearing the plaque away

120
0:05:39.269,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and not damaging your teeth and gums.

121
0:05:42.667,000 --> 0:05:43,000
We're brushing our teeth because we ate.

122
0:05:44.664,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Eating is another routine thing we all do.

123
0:05:46.724,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Seems simple enough.

124
0:05:48.081,000 --> 0:05:49,000
But it's another field of tribology,

125
0:05:49.88,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and it's not so simple.

126
0:05:51.932,000 --> 0:05:54,000
You have the food, which will break and wear while you're eating,

127
0:05:55.019,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and that food is interacting with your teeth, your tongue,

128
0:05:57.81,000 --> 0:05:58,000
your saliva, your throat.

129
0:05:59.161,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And all of those interactions are going to influence your experience of eating.

130
0:06:04.569,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I think you can all recall a moment where you tried something new

131
0:06:07.738,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and you just found yourself going,

132
0:06:11.493,000 --> 0:06:12,000
"Well, it tastes alright.

133
0:06:12.762,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I really don't like that texture."

134
0:06:15.535,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Tribologists are looking at lubricity, the coefficient of friction,

135
0:06:19.432,000 --> 0:06:24,000
as ways to connect mouth feel and texture to what you're experiencing,

136
0:06:24.724,000 --> 0:06:27,000
so that if we're changing the formulations of what we're eating and drinking

137
0:06:28.354,000 --> 0:06:31,000
so the sugar content or fat content are different,

138
0:06:31.541,000 --> 0:06:32,000
how does that change mouth feel?

139
0:06:33.359,000 --> 0:06:34,000
How do we quantify that?

140
0:06:35.32,000 --> 0:06:37,000
This is what tribologists are looking to solve.

141
0:06:38.441,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And while my colleagues were in one corner of this lab

142
0:06:40.99,000 --> 0:06:41,000
looking at the fat content of yogurt,

143
0:06:42.789,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I was in another corner

144
0:06:44.011,000 --> 0:06:45,000
studying dog food.

145
0:06:45.531,000 --> 0:06:47,000
That lab smelled really good, by the way, let me tell you.

146
0:06:48.994,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We all brush our teeth on a regular basis.

147
0:06:51.486,000 --> 0:06:52,000
How many of us brush our pets' teeth?

148
0:06:55.21,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Animals as adults commonly get periodontal disease,

149
0:06:58.043,000 --> 0:07:,000
so we really should be brushing their teeth,

150
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and more pet owners are starting to do this.

151
0:07:02.34,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I know my best friend is really great at brushing her cat's teeth, somehow.

152
0:07:05.913,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Good luck trying to do that with my cat.

153
0:07:07.876,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So what pet food suppliers are trying to do

154
0:07:10.071,000 --> 0:07:12,000
is incorporate plaque removal in things like treats.

155
0:07:13.265,000 --> 0:07:14,000
If you have a dog,

156
0:07:14.796,000 --> 0:07:16,000
you may have observed that you give a dog a treat,

157
0:07:17.275,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and it magically seems to disappear after just one bite.

158
0:07:20.225,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So the added challenge here is:

159
0:07:21.759,000 --> 0:07:23,000
How do you remove plaque when you have one bite?

160
0:07:25.208,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I developed a benchtop test to study this problem,

161
0:07:27.747,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and to do so, I had to mimic the oral system of dogs:

162
0:07:30.263,000 --> 0:07:33,000
their teeth, plaque, saliva.

163
0:07:33.841,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And I used friction and wear measurements

164
0:07:35.892,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to study the effectiveness of that treat on removing plaque.

165
0:07:40.81,000 --> 0:07:42,000
If you're sitting there right now thinking about the last time

166
0:07:43.757,000 --> 0:07:45,000
you didn't brush your dog's teeth, you're very welcome.

167
0:07:46.383,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But what's the big deal with tribology?

168
0:07:48.971,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Let me give you one more example.

169
0:07:52.133,000 --> 0:07:55,000
No matter where you are right now, you got to this location somehow.

170
0:07:55.652,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Maybe you walked or rode your bike,

171
0:07:57.379,000 --> 0:08:,000
but for most people in this room, you probably came in a car.

172
0:08:01.112,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Just think about all the tribological systems in a car.

173
0:08:04.163,000 --> 0:08:06,000
You have your personal interactions with the car,

174
0:08:06.507,000 --> 0:08:07,000
the car's interactions with the road

175
0:08:08.321,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and everything under the hood and in the drivetrain.

176
0:08:11.099,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Some routine maintenance is directly connected to tribology.

177
0:08:15.602,000 --> 0:08:17,000
You know how many miles your tires are recommended for using

178
0:08:18.496,000 --> 0:08:19,000
before you replace them.

179
0:08:20.052,000 --> 0:08:22,000
You regularly check the treads on those tires.

180
0:08:23.363,000 --> 0:08:26,000
You're actively monitoring the wear of your tires.

181
0:08:27.694,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Tribology is the study of wear and friction,

182
0:08:31.29,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and with tires, friction can be the difference between a safe arrival

183
0:08:34.631,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and a car accident.

184
0:08:36.466,000 --> 0:08:38,000
This is because the friction between your tires and the road

185
0:08:39.399,000 --> 0:08:41,000
will influence your acceleration, your deceleration

186
0:08:41.944,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and your stopping distance.

187
0:08:44.193,000 --> 0:08:47,000
As a driver, you instinctively already know how important friction is,

188
0:08:47.55,000 --> 0:08:49,000
because you know that when the roads are wet,

189
0:08:49.709,000 --> 0:08:51,000
they're more dangerous because they're slippery.

190
0:08:52.425,000 --> 0:08:54,000
This is because the water is reducing the friction

191
0:08:54.836,000 --> 0:08:55,000
between your tires and the road.

192
0:08:56.389,000 --> 0:08:58,000
You may recall that friction is the force that opposes motion,

193
0:08:59.346,000 --> 0:09:02,000
so water reducing that force means it's now easier for you to move,

194
0:09:02.67,000 --> 0:09:04,000
hence it's more slippery when the roads are wet.

195
0:09:06.436,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Something else to consider

196
0:09:08.388,000 --> 0:09:1,000
is that overcoming friction takes energy,

197
0:09:11.266,000 --> 0:09:12,000
so you're losing energy to friction.

198
0:09:13.861,000 --> 0:09:15,000
This is one way your tires can influence your fuel efficiency.

199
0:09:16.878,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And, in fact, did you know that about one-third of the fuel

200
0:09:19.834,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that you put into your internal combustion engine vehicle

201
0:09:22.685,000 --> 0:09:23,000
will be spent overcoming friction?

202
0:09:25.553,000 --> 0:09:26,000
One-third.

203
0:09:27.32,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Tribology research has helped us reduce friction

204
0:09:30.134,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and therefore increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.

205
0:09:33.825,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Holmberg and Erdemir have actually done some great studies

206
0:09:36.567,000 --> 0:09:38,000
showing the impact tribology research can have

207
0:09:38.75,000 --> 0:09:39,000
on reducing our energy consumption.

208
0:09:40.486,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And they found that, looking over the span of 20 years,

209
0:09:43.629,000 --> 0:09:44,000
we had the opportunity to reduce

210
0:09:45.451,000 --> 0:09:47,000
the energy consumption of passenger vehicles

211
0:09:47.733,000 --> 0:09:48,000
up to 60 percent.

212
0:09:49.714,000 --> 0:09:51,000
When you think about all the cars in the world,

213
0:09:51.952,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that's a lot of energy we can save.

214
0:09:54.444,000 --> 0:09:58,000
It's part of the nearly nine percent of our current global energy consumption

215
0:09:59.244,000 --> 0:10:02,000
that the authors identified tribology can help us save.

216
0:10:03.96,000 --> 0:10:04,000
That's a significant amount of energy.

217
0:10:05.815,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So when you look at the numbers, tribology can do some amazing things.

218
0:10:10.791,000 --> 0:10:12,000
My colleagues have identified up to 20 quads of energy

219
0:10:13.474,000 --> 0:10:15,000
we can save across the US alone.

220
0:10:15.56,000 --> 0:10:16,000
To put this in perspective:

221
0:10:16.888,000 --> 0:10:21,000
one quad of energy is roughly equivalent to 180 million barrels of oil,

222
0:10:22.732,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and tribology can help us save 20 times that.

223
0:10:25.983,000 --> 0:10:27,000
This is through new materials, new lubricants,

224
0:10:28.702,000 --> 0:10:29,000
novel component design,

225
0:10:30.639,000 --> 0:10:33,000
doing things like making wind turbines more efficient and reliable.

226
0:10:35.27,000 --> 0:10:37,000
This happened just by putting 31 people in a room

227
0:10:37.621,000 --> 0:10:39,000
who viewed the world through a tribology lens.

228
0:10:40.576,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Imagine the opportunities that will reveal themselves

229
0:10:43.609,000 --> 0:10:45,000
as more of us start to see tribology all around.

230
0:10:47.391,000 --> 0:10:5,000
My favorite projects right now are in aerospace applications.

231
0:10:50.465,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I love reducing wear and friction in these challenging environments.

232
0:10:53.898,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I can make materials and parts

233
0:10:56.459,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that will reduce the friction in moving components and engines

234
0:10:59.443,000 --> 0:11:01,000
so that they have less force opposing their motion.

235
0:11:02.509,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Less force to move means they require less power,

236
0:11:06.273,000 --> 0:11:07,000
so you can use a smaller actuator,

237
0:11:08.178,000 --> 0:11:09,000
which would weigh less,

238
0:11:09.737,000 --> 0:11:1,000
which saves fuel.

239
0:11:11.938,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I can also help make parts that last longer through lower wear.

240
0:11:15.639,000 --> 0:11:16,000
This will reduce material waste

241
0:11:17.163,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and also means we're manufacturing the parts less frequently,

242
0:11:20.25,000 --> 0:11:22,000
so we're saving energy in manufacturing.

243
0:11:22.997,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I encourage you to start seeing tribology in the world around you

244
0:11:26.197,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and to think about how you would improve those interacting surfaces you experience.

245
0:11:30.893,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Even the smallest improvements

246
0:11:32.897,000 --> 0:11:33,000
really add up.

247
0:11:35.407,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Tribology may be a funny-sounding word,

248
0:11:38.077,000 --> 0:11:4,000
but it has a huge impact on our world.

249
0:11:41.424,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Thank you.

250
0:11:42.608,000 --> 0:11:44,000
(Applause)

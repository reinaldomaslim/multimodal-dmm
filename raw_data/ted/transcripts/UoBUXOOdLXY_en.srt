2
0:00:15.285,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So a few weeks ago, a friend

3
0:00:17.982,000 --> 0:00:19,000
of mine gave this toy car to his

4
0:00:20.236,000 --> 0:00:21,000
8-year-old son.

5
0:00:21.847,000 --> 0:00:23,000
But instead of going into a store and buying one,

6
0:00:24.668,000 --> 0:00:26,000
like we do normally, he went to this

7
0:00:27.463,000 --> 0:00:28,000
website and he downloaded

8
0:00:29.378,000 --> 0:00:31,000
a file, and then he printed it

9
0:00:31.547,000 --> 0:00:32,000
on this printer.

10
0:00:33.402,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So this idea that you can

11
0:00:35.381,000 --> 0:00:36,000
manufacture objects

12
0:00:37.328,000 --> 0:00:38,000
digitally using these machines

13
0:00:38.891,000 --> 0:00:39,000
is something that The Economist magazine

14
0:00:40.569,000 --> 0:00:42,000
defined as the Third Industrial Revolution.

15
0:00:43.199,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Actually, I argue that there is another revolution

16
0:00:47.042,000 --> 0:00:49,000
going on, and it's the one that has to do with

17
0:00:49.64,000 --> 0:00:51,000
open-source hardware and the maker's movement,

18
0:00:52.168,000 --> 0:00:55,000
because the printer that my friend used

19
0:00:55.927,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to print the toy is actually open-source.

20
0:00:58.544,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So you go to the same website, you can download all the files

21
0:01:02.037,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that you need in order to make that printer:

22
0:01:05.794,000 --> 0:01:08,000
the construction files, the hardware, the software,

23
0:01:09.306,000 --> 0:01:11,000
all the instruction is there.

24
0:01:12.115,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And also this is part of a large

25
0:01:14.235,000 --> 0:01:16,000
community where there are thousands of people

26
0:01:16.835,000 --> 0:01:17,000
around the world that are actually

27
0:01:18.795,000 --> 0:01:19,000
making these kinds of printers,

28
0:01:20.338,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and there's a lot of innovation

29
0:01:21.81,000 --> 0:01:22,000
happening because it's all open-source.

30
0:01:23.724,000 --> 0:01:26,000
You don't need anybody's permission to create something great.

31
0:01:27.612,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And that space is like

32
0:01:29.973,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the personal computer in 1976,

33
0:01:32.769,000 --> 0:01:34,000
like the Apples with the other companies are fighting,

34
0:01:35.127,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and we will see in a few years,

35
0:01:37.508,000 --> 0:01:4,000
there will be the Apple of this kind of market come out.

36
0:01:40.641,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Well, there's also another interesting thing.

37
0:01:44.444,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I said the electronics are open-source, because at the heart

38
0:01:46.408,000 --> 0:01:48,000
of this printer there is something I'm really attached to:

39
0:01:49.389,000 --> 0:01:51,000
these Arduino boards, the motherboard that sort of

40
0:01:52.34,000 --> 0:01:54,000
powers this printer, is a project

41
0:01:54.547,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I've been working on for the past seven years.

42
0:01:56.97,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It's an open-source project.

43
0:01:58.531,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I worked with these friends of mine that I have here.

44
0:02:01.552,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So the five of us, two Americans, two Italians

45
0:02:04.206,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and a Spaniard, we — (Laughter)

46
0:02:07.187,000 --> 0:02:1,000
You know, it's a worldwide project. (Laughter)

47
0:02:10.262,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So we came together in this

48
0:02:12.131,000 --> 0:02:14,000
design institute called the Interaction Design Institute

49
0:02:14.754,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Ivrea, which was teaching

50
0:02:16.903,000 --> 0:02:18,000
interaction design, this idea that you can take

51
0:02:19.201,000 --> 0:02:21,000
design from the simple shape

52
0:02:21.752,000 --> 0:02:22,000
of an object and you can move it

53
0:02:23.529,000 --> 0:02:25,000
forward to design the way you interact with things.

54
0:02:25.581,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Well, when you design an object that's supposed to interact

55
0:02:28.473,000 --> 0:02:29,000
with a human being, if you make a foam model

56
0:02:30.281,000 --> 0:02:32,000
of a mobile phone, it doesn't make any sense.

57
0:02:33.104,000 --> 0:02:34,000
You have to have something that

58
0:02:34.61,000 --> 0:02:36,000
actually interacts with people.

59
0:02:37.117,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So, we worked on Arduino and

60
0:02:40.236,000 --> 0:02:41,000
a lot of other projects there to

61
0:02:42.052,000 --> 0:02:43,000
create platforms that would be

62
0:02:43.953,000 --> 0:02:45,000
simple for our students to use,

63
0:02:46.137,000 --> 0:02:48,000
so that our students could just build things that worked,

64
0:02:48.598,000 --> 0:02:52,000
but they don't have five years to become an electronics engineer. We have one month.

65
0:02:52.656,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So how do I make something that even a kid can use?

66
0:02:55.311,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And actually, with Arduino,

67
0:02:58.212,000 --> 0:03:,000
we have kids like Sylvia that you see here,

68
0:03:00.635,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that actually make projects with Arduino.

69
0:03:02.507,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I have 11-year-old kids stop me and show me

70
0:03:05.115,000 --> 0:03:07,000
stuff they built for Arduino that's really

71
0:03:07.934,000 --> 0:03:08,000
scary to see the capabilities

72
0:03:09.675,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that kids have when you give them the tools.

73
0:03:12.098,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So let's look at what happens when you make a tool

74
0:03:15.078,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that anybody can just pick up and build something quickly,

75
0:03:17.925,000 --> 0:03:18,000
so one of the examples that I like to sort of

76
0:03:19.793,000 --> 0:03:2,000
kick off this discussion is this

77
0:03:21.707,000 --> 0:03:22,000
example of this cat feeder.

78
0:03:23.437,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The gentleman who made this project had two cats.

79
0:03:26.004,000 --> 0:03:27,000
One was sick and the other one

80
0:03:27.738,000 --> 0:03:29,000
was healthy, so he had to make

81
0:03:30.116,000 --> 0:03:31,000
sure they ate the proper food.

82
0:03:31.804,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So he made this thing that recognizes the cat

83
0:03:33.963,000 --> 0:03:35,000
from a chip mounted inside

84
0:03:36.1,000 --> 0:03:38,000
on the collar of the cat, and opens the door

85
0:03:38.82,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and the cat can eat the food.

86
0:03:40.564,000 --> 0:03:41,000
This is made by recycling an old CD player

87
0:03:42.354,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that you can get from an old computer,

88
0:03:44.567,000 --> 0:03:47,000
some cardboard, tape, couple of sensors, a few blinking LEDs,

89
0:03:48.023,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and then suddenly you have a tool. You build something

90
0:03:50.811,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that you cannot find on the market.

91
0:03:52.748,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And I like this phrase: "Scratch your own itch."

92
0:03:55.512,000 --> 0:03:57,000
If you have an idea, you just go and you make it.

93
0:03:58.107,000 --> 0:03:59,000
This is the equivalent of sketching on paper

94
0:04:00.056,000 --> 0:04:02,000
done with electronics.

95
0:04:02.628,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So one of the features that I

96
0:04:04.376,000 --> 0:04:05,000
think is important about our work

97
0:04:06.204,000 --> 0:04:08,000
is that our hardware, on top of

98
0:04:08.976,000 --> 0:04:1,000
being made with love in Italy —

99
0:04:11.166,000 --> 0:04:12,000
as you can see from the

100
0:04:12.919,000 --> 0:04:14,000
back of the circuit — (Laughter)

101
0:04:14.948,000 --> 0:04:15,000
is that it's open,

102
0:04:16.788,000 --> 0:04:17,000
so we publish all the design

103
0:04:18.756,000 --> 0:04:19,000
files for the circuit online,

104
0:04:20.484,000 --> 0:04:21,000
so you can download it and

105
0:04:22.467,000 --> 0:04:23,000
you can actually use it to

106
0:04:24.307,000 --> 0:04:26,000
make something, or to modify, to learn.

107
0:04:26.94,000 --> 0:04:27,000
You know, when I was learning about programming,

108
0:04:28.209,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I learned by looking at other people's code,

109
0:04:30.086,000 --> 0:04:33,000
or looking at other people's circuits in magazines.

110
0:04:33.515,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And this is a good way to learn,

111
0:04:35.731,000 --> 0:04:37,000
by looking at other people's work.

112
0:04:37.972,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So the different elements of the project are all open,

113
0:04:40.564,000 --> 0:04:41,000
so the hardware is released

114
0:04:42.267,000 --> 0:04:44,000
with a Creative Commons license.

115
0:04:44.331,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So, you know, I like this idea that hardware becomes

116
0:04:46.357,000 --> 0:04:48,000
like a piece of culture that you share

117
0:04:48.496,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and you build upon, like it was

118
0:04:50.455,000 --> 0:04:53,000
a song or a poem with Creative Commons.

119
0:04:54.092,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Or, the software is GPL, so it's open-source as well.

120
0:04:56.768,000 --> 0:04:59,000
The documentation and the hands-on teaching

121
0:05:00.195,000 --> 0:05:03,000
methodology is also open-source and released as the Creative Commons.

122
0:05:03.778,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Just the name is protected so

123
0:05:05.781,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that we can make sure that we can tell people

124
0:05:08.527,000 --> 0:05:1,000
what is Arduino and what isn't.

125
0:05:11.167,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now, Arduino itself is made of

126
0:05:12.839,000 --> 0:05:14,000
a lot of different open-source components

127
0:05:15.079,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that maybe individually are hard to use for

128
0:05:17.83,000 --> 0:05:19,000
a 12-year-old kid, so Arduino

129
0:05:19.937,000 --> 0:05:2,000
wraps everything together into

130
0:05:21.79,000 --> 0:05:23,000
a mashup of open-source technologies

131
0:05:24.056,000 --> 0:05:25,000
where we try to give them the

132
0:05:25.928,000 --> 0:05:27,000
best user experience to get something done quickly.

133
0:05:28.135,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So you have situations like this,

134
0:05:31.006,000 --> 0:05:32,000
where some people in Chile

135
0:05:32.944,000 --> 0:05:34,000
decided to make their own boards instead of buying them,

136
0:05:35.742,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to organize a workshop and

137
0:05:37.667,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to save money. Or there are

138
0:05:40.767,000 --> 0:05:41,000
companies that make their own

139
0:05:42.712,000 --> 0:05:43,000
variations of Arduino that fit

140
0:05:44.481,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in a certain market, and there's

141
0:05:46.232,000 --> 0:05:48,000
probably, maybe like a 150 of them

142
0:05:48.945,000 --> 0:05:49,000
or something at the moment.

143
0:05:50.737,000 --> 0:05:51,000
This one is made by a company

144
0:05:52.625,000 --> 0:05:53,000
called Adafruit, which is run by

145
0:05:54.569,000 --> 0:05:56,000
this woman called Limor Fried,

146
0:05:56.881,000 --> 0:05:57,000
also known as Ladyada, who is

147
0:05:58.488,000 --> 0:06:,000
one of the heroes of the open-source hardware movement

148
0:06:01.209,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and the maker movement.

149
0:06:02.743,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So, this idea that you have a new, sort of

150
0:06:05.697,000 --> 0:06:07,000
turbo-charged DIY community

151
0:06:08.481,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that believes in open-source,

152
0:06:10.161,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in collaboration, collaborates

153
0:06:12.361,000 --> 0:06:14,000
online, collaborates in different spaces.

154
0:06:14.802,000 --> 0:06:17,000
There is this magazine called Make that sort of gathered

155
0:06:17.924,000 --> 0:06:18,000
all these people and sort of put them together

156
0:06:19.464,000 --> 0:06:21,000
as a community, and you see

157
0:06:21.896,000 --> 0:06:23,000
a very technical project explained in a

158
0:06:23.924,000 --> 0:06:25,000
very simple language, beautifully typeset.

159
0:06:26.781,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Or you have websites,

160
0:06:28.349,000 --> 0:06:3,000
like this one, like Instructables,

161
0:06:30.61,000 --> 0:06:32,000
where people actually teach each other about anything.

162
0:06:32.614,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So this one is about Arduino projects,

163
0:06:34.359,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the page you see on the screen, but effectively here you can

164
0:06:37.92,000 --> 0:06:39,000
learn how to make a cake and everything else.

165
0:06:40.498,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So let's look at some projects.

166
0:06:43.298,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So this one is a quadcopter.

167
0:06:44.914,000 --> 0:06:45,000
It's a small model helicopter.

168
0:06:46.629,000 --> 0:06:48,000
In a way, it's a toy, no?

169
0:06:48.899,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And so this one was military technology

170
0:06:51.192,000 --> 0:06:52,000
a few years ago, and now it's

171
0:06:53.113,000 --> 0:06:55,000
open-source, easy to use, you can buy it online.

172
0:06:55.755,000 --> 0:06:58,000
DIY Drones is the community; they do this thing called ArduCopter.

173
0:06:59.673,000 --> 0:07:02,000
But then somebody actually launched this start-up called

174
0:07:02.686,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Matternet, where they figured out that you could

175
0:07:04.879,000 --> 0:07:06,000
use this to actually transport

176
0:07:07.177,000 --> 0:07:09,000
things from one village to another in Africa,

177
0:07:09.61,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and the fact that this was easy to find,

178
0:07:11.178,000 --> 0:07:13,000
open-source, easy to hack, enabled them

179
0:07:13.79,000 --> 0:07:15,000
to prototype their company really quickly.

180
0:07:15.928,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Or, other projects. Matt Richardson: I'm getting a little sick

181
0:07:18.617,000 --> 0:07:21,000
of hearing about the same people on TV over and over and over

182
0:07:21.873,000 --> 0:07:24,000
again, so I decided to do something about it.

183
0:07:25.083,000 --> 0:07:26,000
This Arduino project,

184
0:07:26.497,000 --> 0:07:29,000
which I call the Enough Already, will mute the TV anytime

185
0:07:29.872,000 --> 0:07:3,000
any of these over-exposed

186
0:07:31.847,000 --> 0:07:32,000
personalities is mentioned. (Laughter)

187
0:07:33.079,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I'll show you how I made it. (Applause)

188
0:07:37.927,000 --> 0:07:38,000
MB: Check this out.

189
0:07:39.751,000 --> 0:07:4,000
MR: Our producers caught up with Kim Kardashian earlier

190
0:07:41.708,000 --> 0:07:43,000
today to find out what she was planning on wearing to her —

191
0:07:44.611,000 --> 0:07:45,000
MB: Eh? (Laughter)

192
0:07:46.002,000 --> 0:07:47,000
MR: It should do a pretty good

193
0:07:47.904,000 --> 0:07:48,000
job of protecting our ears from having to hear about the details

194
0:07:49.571,000 --> 0:07:5,000
of Kim Kardashian's wedding.

195
0:07:51.367,000 --> 0:07:55,000
MB: Okay. So, you know, again, what is interesting here

196
0:07:55.924,000 --> 0:07:57,000
is that Matt found this module

197
0:07:58.894,000 --> 0:08:,000
that lets Arduino process

198
0:08:01.126,000 --> 0:08:02,000
TV signals, he found some code

199
0:08:03.015,000 --> 0:08:05,000
written by somebody else that generates infrared signals for the TV,

200
0:08:05.844,000 --> 0:08:07,000
put it together and then created this great project.

201
0:08:08.194,000 --> 0:08:1,000
It's also used, Arduino's used,

202
0:08:10.246,000 --> 0:08:12,000
in serious places like, you know, the Large Hadron Collider.

203
0:08:13.146,000 --> 0:08:15,000
There's some Arduino balls collecting data and sort of

204
0:08:15.855,000 --> 0:08:16,000
measuring some parameters.

205
0:08:17.655,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Or it's used for —

206
0:08:19.974,000 --> 0:08:29,000
(Music)

207
0:08:30.686,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So this is a musical interface

208
0:08:33.127,000 --> 0:08:35,000
built by a student from Italy,

209
0:08:35.246,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and he's now turning this into

210
0:08:37.366,000 --> 0:08:38,000
a product. Because it was a

211
0:08:39.224,000 --> 0:08:41,000
student project becoming a product.

212
0:08:41.455,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Or it can be used to make an assistive device.

213
0:08:43.399,000 --> 0:08:44,000
This is a glove that understands

214
0:08:45.389,000 --> 0:08:47,000
the sign language and transforms

215
0:08:47.536,000 --> 0:08:49,000
the gestures you make into sounds

216
0:08:49.735,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and writes the words that you're signing on a display

217
0:08:53.051,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And again, this is made of all different parts you can find

218
0:08:54.397,000 --> 0:08:56,000
on all the websites that sell Arduino-compatible parts,

219
0:08:57.346,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and you assemble it into a project.

220
0:08:59.43,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Or this is a project from the ITP part of NYU,

221
0:09:02.751,000 --> 0:09:03,000
where they met with this boy

222
0:09:04.478,000 --> 0:09:07,000
who has a severe disability, cannot play with the PS3,

223
0:09:07.496,000 --> 0:09:08,000
so they built this device that

224
0:09:09.439,000 --> 0:09:11,000
allows the kid to play baseball

225
0:09:11.886,000 --> 0:09:12,000
although he has limited

226
0:09:13.783,000 --> 0:09:15,000
movement capability.

227
0:09:16.159,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Or you can find it in arts projects.

228
0:09:18.309,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So this is the txtBomber.

229
0:09:20.624,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So you put a message into this device

230
0:09:22.261,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and then you roll it on the wall, and it basically

231
0:09:25.104,000 --> 0:09:26,000
has all these solenoids

232
0:09:27.006,000 --> 0:09:28,000
pressing the buttons on spray cans,

233
0:09:28.798,000 --> 0:09:29,000
so you just pull it over a wall

234
0:09:30.434,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and it just writes on the wall

235
0:09:32.161,000 --> 0:09:34,000
all the political messages.

236
0:09:34.623,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So, yeah. (Applause)

237
0:09:37.254,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Then we have this plant here.

238
0:09:39.294,000 --> 0:09:4,000
This is called Botanicalls,

239
0:09:41.184,000 --> 0:09:44,000
because there's an Arduino ball with a Wi-Fi module

240
0:09:44.379,000 --> 0:09:46,000
in the plant, and it's measuring

241
0:09:46.98,000 --> 0:09:47,000
the well-being of the plant,

242
0:09:48.495,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and it's creating a Twitter account

243
0:09:50.485,000 --> 0:09:53,000
where you can actually interact with the plant. (Laughter)

244
0:09:54.014,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So, you know, this plant

245
0:09:55.944,000 --> 0:09:57,000
will start to say, "This is really hot," or

246
0:09:58.423,000 --> 0:10:02,000
there's a lot of, you know, "I need water right now." (Laughter)

247
0:10:02.494,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So it just gives a personality to your plant.

248
0:10:05.917,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Or this is something that twitters when the

249
0:10:08.584,000 --> 0:10:09,000
baby inside the belly of a

250
0:10:10.55,000 --> 0:10:12,000
pregnant woman kicks. (Laughter)

251
0:10:13.158,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Or this is a 14-year-old kid in

252
0:10:14.749,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Chile who made a system that

253
0:10:16.869,000 --> 0:10:18,000
detects earthquakes and publishes on Twitter.

254
0:10:19.193,000 --> 0:10:21,000
He has 280,000 followers.

255
0:10:21.681,000 --> 0:10:23,000
He's 14 and he anticipated

256
0:10:23.825,000 --> 0:10:26,000
a governmental project by one year. (Applause)

257
0:10:27.464,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Or again, another project where,

258
0:10:31.205,000 --> 0:10:32,000
by analyzing the Twitter feed

259
0:10:32.951,000 --> 0:10:33,000
of a family, you can basically

260
0:10:34.887,000 --> 0:10:36,000
point where they are, like in the "Harry Potter" movie.

261
0:10:37.629,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So you can find out everything about this project on the website.

262
0:10:40.445,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Or somebody made a chair that twitters when somebody farts. (Laughter)

263
0:10:45.126,000 --> 0:10:48,000
It's interesting how, in 2009,

264
0:10:48.209,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Gizmodo basically defined,

265
0:10:50.591,000 --> 0:10:52,000
said that this project actually gives a meaning to Twitter,

266
0:10:53.354,000 --> 0:10:56,000
so it was — a lot changed in between. (Laughter)

267
0:10:56.615,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So very serious project.

268
0:10:58.059,000 --> 0:11:,000
When the Fukushima disaster happened,

269
0:11:00.266,000 --> 0:11:03,000
a bunch of people in Japan, they realized that the information

270
0:11:03.268,000 --> 0:11:05,000
that the government was giving wasn't really open

271
0:11:05.823,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and really reliable, so they built

272
0:11:07.573,000 --> 0:11:09,000
this Geiger counter, plus Arduino, plus network

273
0:11:10.349,000 --> 0:11:11,000
interface. They made 100

274
0:11:12.281,000 --> 0:11:15,000
of them and gave them to people around Japan, and essentially

275
0:11:15.859,000 --> 0:11:17,000
the data that they gathered gets published on this website

276
0:11:18.119,000 --> 0:11:2,000
called Cosm, another website

277
0:11:20.268,000 --> 0:11:23,000
they built, so you can actually get reliable real-time

278
0:11:23.909,000 --> 0:11:24,000
information from the field,

279
0:11:25.734,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and you can get unbiased information.

280
0:11:29.341,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Or this machine here, it's from

281
0:11:31.224,000 --> 0:11:33,000
the DIY bio movement,

282
0:11:33.664,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and it's one of the steps that you need in order to process DNA,

283
0:11:35.988,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and again, it's completely open-source from the ground up.

284
0:11:39.366,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Or you have students in developing countries making

285
0:11:42.76,000 --> 0:11:44,000
replicas of scientific instruments that cost

286
0:11:45.749,000 --> 0:11:46,000
a lot of money to make.

287
0:11:47.66,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Actually they just build them themselves for a lot less

288
0:11:50.25,000 --> 0:11:51,000
using Arduino and a few parts.

289
0:11:51.483,000 --> 0:11:52,000
This is a pH probe.

290
0:11:53.379,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Or you get kids, like these kids, they're from Spain.

291
0:11:56.777,000 --> 0:11:58,000
They learned how to program and to make robots when they

292
0:11:59.641,000 --> 0:12:01,000
were probably, like, 11, and then they started to use Arduino

293
0:12:02.31,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to make these robots that play football. They became

294
0:12:04.303,000 --> 0:12:06,000
world champions by making an Arduino-based robot.

295
0:12:07.145,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And so when we had to make

296
0:12:09.021,000 --> 0:12:11,000
our own educational robot, we just went to them and said,

297
0:12:11.833,000 --> 0:12:13,000
you know, "You design it, because you know exactly

298
0:12:14.181,000 --> 0:12:17,000
what is needed to make a great robot that excites kids."

299
0:12:17.911,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Not me. I'm an old guy.

300
0:12:19.587,000 --> 0:12:21,000
What am I supposed to excite, huh? (Laughter)

301
0:12:22.123,000 --> 0:12:25,000
But as I — in terms of educational assets. (Laughter)

302
0:12:26.058,000 --> 0:12:27,000
There's also companies like Google

303
0:12:27.956,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that are using the technology

304
0:12:29.907,000 --> 0:12:31,000
to create interfaces between

305
0:12:32.781,000 --> 0:12:35,000
mobile phones, tablets and the real world.

306
0:12:36.174,000 --> 0:12:37,000
So the Accessory Development Kit

307
0:12:37.194,000 --> 0:12:39,000
from Google is open-source

308
0:12:39.246,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and based on Arduino, as opposed

309
0:12:40.628,000 --> 0:12:41,000
to the one from Apple which is

310
0:12:42.285,000 --> 0:12:44,000
closed-source, NDA, sign your

311
0:12:44.789,000 --> 0:12:46,000
life to Apple. Here you are.

312
0:12:47.354,000 --> 0:12:49,000
There's a giant maze, and Joey's sitting there, and the

313
0:12:49.934,000 --> 0:12:53,000
maze is moving when you tilt the tablet.

314
0:12:54.118,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Also, I come from Italy, and the design is important

315
0:12:57.09,000 --> 0:12:59,000
in Italy, and yet very conservative.

316
0:12:59.437,000 --> 0:13:,000
So we worked with a design

317
0:13:00.854,000 --> 0:13:02,000
studio called Habits, in Milan,

318
0:13:03.02,000 --> 0:13:05,000
to make this mirror, which is completely open-source.

319
0:13:05.708,000 --> 0:13:08,000
This doubles also as an iPod speaker.

320
0:13:08.893,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So the idea is that the hardware, the software,

321
0:13:12.53,000 --> 0:13:13,000
the design of the object, the fabrication,

322
0:13:13.998,000 --> 0:13:15,000
everything about this project is open-source

323
0:13:16.483,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and you can make it yourself.

324
0:13:18.353,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So we want other designers to pick this up and learn how

325
0:13:20.707,000 --> 0:13:22,000
to make great devices, to learn

326
0:13:23.318,000 --> 0:13:24,000
how to make interactive products

327
0:13:24.996,000 --> 0:13:26,000
by starting from something real.

328
0:13:27.765,000 --> 0:13:29,000
But when you have this idea,

329
0:13:30.166,000 --> 0:13:31,000
you know, what happens to all these ideas?

330
0:13:32.079,000 --> 0:13:33,000
There's, like, thousands of ideas that I —

331
0:13:33.957,000 --> 0:13:35,000
You know, it would take seven hours for me to do

332
0:13:36.117,000 --> 0:13:37,000
all the presentations.

333
0:13:37.997,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I will not take all the seven hours. Thank you.

334
0:13:41.045,000 --> 0:13:43,000
But let's start from this example:

335
0:13:43.061,000 --> 0:13:44,000
So, the group of people

336
0:13:44.989,000 --> 0:13:46,000
that started this company called Pebble, they prototyped

337
0:13:47.4,000 --> 0:13:5,000
a watch that communicates via Bluetooth with your phone,

338
0:13:51.092,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and you can display information

339
0:13:52.628,000 --> 0:13:54,000
on it. And they prototyped with

340
0:13:54.9,000 --> 0:13:55,000
an old LCD screen from a Nokia

341
0:13:56.845,000 --> 0:13:58,000
mobile phone and an Arduino.

342
0:13:59.253,000 --> 0:14:,000
And then, when they had a final

343
0:14:01.086,000 --> 0:14:03,000
project, they actually went to Kickstarter

344
0:14:03.494,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and they were asking for 100,000 dollars to make

345
0:14:06.113,000 --> 0:14:07,000
a few of them to sell.

346
0:14:07.968,000 --> 0:14:09,000
They got 10 million dollars.

347
0:14:10.039,000 --> 0:14:11,000
They got a completely

348
0:14:11.574,000 --> 0:14:13,000
fully funded start-up, and they don't have to,

349
0:14:14.287,000 --> 0:14:15,000
you know, get VCs involved or anything,

350
0:14:16.139,000 --> 0:14:18,000
just excite the people with their great project.

351
0:14:19.007,000 --> 0:14:21,000
The last project I want to show you is this:

352
0:14:21.291,000 --> 0:14:24,000
It's called ArduSat. It's currently on Kickstarter,

353
0:14:25.029,000 --> 0:14:27,000
so if you want to contribute, please do it.

354
0:14:27.336,000 --> 0:14:29,000
It's a satellite that goes into space, which is probably

355
0:14:30.146,000 --> 0:14:31,000
the least open-source thing you can imagine,

356
0:14:32.068,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and it contains an Arduino

357
0:14:34.119,000 --> 0:14:37,000
connected to a bunch of sensors. So if you know how to use Arduino,

358
0:14:37.229,000 --> 0:14:39,000
you can actually upload your experiments

359
0:14:39.685,000 --> 0:14:41,000
into this satellite and run them.

360
0:14:41.876,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So imagine, if you as a high school can have the satellite

361
0:14:44.512,000 --> 0:14:46,000
for a week and do satellite

362
0:14:46.861,000 --> 0:14:48,000
space experiments like that.

363
0:14:49.513,000 --> 0:14:51,000
So, as I said, there's

364
0:14:52.269,000 --> 0:14:53,000
lots of examples, and I'm going to stop here. And I just

365
0:14:53.828,000 --> 0:14:55,000
want to thank the Arduino community

366
0:14:56.344,000 --> 0:14:57,000
for being the best, and just

367
0:14:58.014,000 --> 0:15:,000
every day making lots of projects.

368
0:15:00.206,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Thank you. (Applause)

369
0:15:03.67,000 --> 0:15:05,000
(Applause)

370
0:15:05.997,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And thanks to the community.

371
0:15:08.484,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Chris Anderson: Massimo,

372
0:15:10.457,000 --> 0:15:12,000
you told me earlier today that you had no idea, of course,

373
0:15:13.062,000 --> 0:15:14,000
that it would take off like this.

374
0:15:14.534,000 --> 0:15:14,000
MB: No.

375
0:15:15.323,000 --> 0:15:16,000
CA: I mean, how must you feel when you read this stuff and you

376
0:15:17.119,000 --> 0:15:19,000
see what you've unlocked?

377
0:15:19.62,000 --> 0:15:21,000
MB: Well, it's the work of a lot of people, so we as a community

378
0:15:22.439,000 --> 0:15:23,000
are enabling people to make

379
0:15:24.233,000 --> 0:15:26,000
great stuff, and I just feel overwhelmed.

380
0:15:26.735,000 --> 0:15:28,000
It's just, it's difficult to describe this.

381
0:15:28.904,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Every morning, I wake up and I look at all the stuff that

382
0:15:30.918,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Google Alerts sends me, and it's

383
0:15:33.104,000 --> 0:15:34,000
just amazing. It's just

384
0:15:34.639,000 --> 0:15:36,000
going into every field that you can imagine.

385
0:15:37.312,000 --> 0:15:38,000
CA: Thank you so much. (Applause)

386
0:15:39.304,000 --> 0:15:42,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Imagine, if you will -- a gift.

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I'd like for you to picture it in your mind.

3
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It's not too big --

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
about the size of a golf ball.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up.

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But before I show you what's inside,

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I will tell you, it's going to do incredible things for you.

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It will bring all of your family together.

9
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
You will feel loved and appreciated like never before

10
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and reconnect with friends and acquaintances

11
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
you haven't heard from in years.

12
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Adoration and admiration

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
will overwhelm you.

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It will recalibrate what's most important in your life.

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It will redefine your sense

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
of spirituality and faith.

17
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
You'll have a new understanding

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and trust in your body.

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy.

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
You'll expand your vocabulary,

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
meet new people,

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and you'll have a healthier lifestyle.

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And get this --

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
you'll have an eight-week vacation

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
of doing absolutely nothing.

26
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
You'll eat countless gourmet meals.

27
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Flowers will arrive by the truckload.

28
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
People will say to you,

29
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
"You look great. Have you had any work done?"

30
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And you'll have a lifetime supply

31
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
of good drugs.

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
You'll be challenged, inspired,

33
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
motivated and humbled.

34
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Your life will have new meaning.

35
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Peace, health,

36
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
serenity, happiness,

37
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
nirvana.

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
The price?

39
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
$55,000,

40
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and that's an incredible deal.

41
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
By now I know you're dying to know

42
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
what it is and where you can get one.

43
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Does Amazon carry it?

44
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Does it have the Apple logo on it?

45
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Is there a waiting list?

46
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Not likely.

47
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
This gift came to me about five months ago.

48
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up --

49
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
not quite so pretty.

50
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And this,

51
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and then this.

52
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It was a rare gem --

53
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
a brain tumor,

54
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
hemangioblastoma --

55
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
the gift that keeps on giving.

56
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And while I'm okay now,

57
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I wouldn't wish this gift for you.

58
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I'm not sure you'd want it.

59
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But I wouldn't change my experience.

60
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It profoundly altered my life

61
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in ways I didn't expect

62
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in all the ways I just shared with you.

63
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So the next time you're faced

64
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
with something that's unexpected,

65
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
unwanted and uncertain,

66
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
consider

67
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that it just may be a gift.

68
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:15.745,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm a designer and an educator.

3
0:00:18.641,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I'm a multitasking person, and I push my students

4
0:00:21.537,000 --> 0:00:27,000
to fly through a very creative, multitasking design process.

5
0:00:27.648,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But how efficient is, really, this multitasking?

6
0:00:32.613,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Let's consider for a while the option of monotasking.

7
0:00:38.318,000 --> 0:00:4,000
A couple of examples.

8
0:00:41.233,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Look at that.

9
0:00:42.661,000 --> 0:00:45,000
This is my multitasking activity result. (Laughter)

10
0:00:46.274,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So trying to cook, answering the phone, writing SMS,

11
0:00:49.929,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and maybe uploading some pictures

12
0:00:52.281,000 --> 0:00:55,000
about this awesome barbecue.

13
0:00:55.799,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So someone tells us the story about supertaskers,

14
0:00:59.833,000 --> 0:01:02,000
so this two percent of people who are able

15
0:01:03.258,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to control multitasking environment.

16
0:01:07.394,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But what about ourselves, and what about our reality?

17
0:01:11.998,000 --> 0:01:13,000
When's the last time you really enjoyed

18
0:01:14.299,000 --> 0:01:17,000
just the voice of your friend?

19
0:01:17.569,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So this is a project I'm working on,

20
0:01:20.825,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and this is a series of front covers

21
0:01:25.869,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to downgrade our super, hyper —

22
0:01:30.376,000 --> 0:01:34,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

23
0:01:35.293,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to downgrade our super, hyper-mobile phones

24
0:01:38.101,000 --> 0:01:41,000
into the essence of their function.

25
0:01:41.132,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Another example: Have you ever been to Venice?

26
0:01:43.909,000 --> 0:01:47,000
How beautiful it is to lose ourselves in these little streets

27
0:01:48.222,000 --> 0:01:5,000
on the island.

28
0:01:50.605,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But our multitasking reality is pretty different,

29
0:01:54.047,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and full of tons of information.

30
0:01:58.319,000 --> 0:02:,000
So what about something like that

31
0:02:00.856,000 --> 0:02:04,000
to rediscover our sense of adventure?

32
0:02:05.023,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I know that it could sound pretty weird to speak about mono

33
0:02:08.296,000 --> 0:02:12,000
when the number of possibilities is so huge,

34
0:02:12.847,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but I push you to consider the option of

35
0:02:17.446,000 --> 0:02:2,000
focusing on just one task,

36
0:02:20.563,000 --> 0:02:25,000
or maybe turning your digital senses totally off.

37
0:02:26.52,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So nowadays, everyone could produce his mono product.

38
0:02:32.536,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Why not? So find your monotask spot

39
0:02:36.28,000 --> 0:02:38,000
within the multitasking world.

40
0:02:38.864,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Thank you.

41
0:02:40.397,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Applause)

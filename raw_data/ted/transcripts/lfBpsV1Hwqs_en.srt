2
0:00:16.553,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm a gamer, so I like to have goals.

3
0:00:20.386,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I like special missions and secret objectives.

4
0:00:24.59,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So here's my special mission for this talk:

5
0:00:28.281,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I'm going to try to increase the life span of every single person in this room

6
0:00:33.055,000 --> 0:00:35,000
by seven and a half minutes.

7
0:00:35.654,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Literally, you will live seven and a half minutes longer

8
0:00:38.386,000 --> 0:00:39,000
than you would have otherwise,

9
0:00:39.861,000 --> 0:00:4,000
just because you watched this talk.

10
0:00:42.814,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Some of you are looking a little bit skeptical.

11
0:00:45.034,000 --> 0:00:46,000
That's okay, because check it out --

12
0:00:46.774,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I have math to prove that it is possible.

13
0:00:49.551,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It won't make much sense now.

14
0:00:51.048,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I'll explain it all later,

15
0:00:52.384,000 --> 0:00:54,000
just pay attention to the number at the bottom:

16
0:00:54.647,000 --> 0:00:57,000
+7.68245837 minutes.

17
0:00:57.947,000 --> 0:01:,000
That will be my gift to you if I'm successful in my mission.

18
0:01:01.466,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Now, you have a secret mission too.

19
0:01:04.659,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Your mission is to figure out how you want to spend

20
0:01:08.194,000 --> 0:01:1,000
your extra seven and a half minutes.

21
0:01:10.258,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And I think you should do something unusual with them,

22
0:01:12.83,000 --> 0:01:13,000
because these are bonus minutes.

23
0:01:14.384,000 --> 0:01:15,000
You weren't going to have them anyway.

24
0:01:16.376,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Now, because I'm a game designer, you might be thinking to yourself,

25
0:01:20.4,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I know what she wants us to do with those minutes,

26
0:01:22.845,000 --> 0:01:24,000
she wants us to spend them playing games.

27
0:01:24.996,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Now this is a totally reasonable assumption,

28
0:01:27.482,000 --> 0:01:29,000
given that I have made quite a habit of encouraging people

29
0:01:30.268,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to spend more time playing games.

30
0:01:31.914,000 --> 0:01:33,000
For example, in my first TED Talk,

31
0:01:34.194,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I did propose that we should spend 21 billion hours a week,

32
0:01:38.385,000 --> 0:01:4,000
as a planet, playing video games.

33
0:01:40.506,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Now, 21 billion hours, it's a lot of time.

34
0:01:43.893,000 --> 0:01:47,000
It's so much time, in fact, that the number one unsolicited comment

35
0:01:48.227,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that I have heard from people all over the world

36
0:01:50.529,000 --> 0:01:51,000
since I gave that talk, is this:

37
0:01:53.198,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Jane, games are great and all, but on your deathbed,

38
0:01:56.72,000 --> 0:01:59,000
are you really going to wish you spent more time playing Angry Birds?

39
0:02:00.241,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:01.265,000 --> 0:02:03,000
This idea is so pervasive --

41
0:02:03.414,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that games are a waste of time that we will come to regret --

42
0:02:06.332,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that I hear it literally everywhere I go.

43
0:02:08.505,000 --> 0:02:09,000
For example, true story:

44
0:02:10.424,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Just a few weeks ago,

45
0:02:11.788,000 --> 0:02:14,000
this cab driver, upon finding out that a friend and I were in town

46
0:02:15.138,000 --> 0:02:16,000
for a game developers' conference,

47
0:02:17.051,000 --> 0:02:2,000
turned around and said -- and I quote --

48
0:02:20.146,000 --> 0:02:22,000
"I hate games. Waste of life.

49
0:02:22.736,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Imagine getting to the end of your life and regretting all that time."

50
0:02:27.994,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Now, I want to take this problem seriously.

51
0:02:30.613,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I want games to be a force for good in the world.

52
0:02:33.168,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I don't want gamers to regret the time they spent playing,

53
0:02:35.968,000 --> 0:02:37,000
time that I encouraged them to spend.

54
0:02:38.094,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So I have been thinking about this question a lot lately.

55
0:02:41.728,000 --> 0:02:42,000
When we're on our deathbeds,

56
0:02:43.54,000 --> 0:02:45,000
will we regret the time we spent playing games?

57
0:02:47.159,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Now, this may surprise you, but it turns out

58
0:02:49.674,000 --> 0:02:52,000
there is actually some scientific research on this question.

59
0:02:52.842,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It's true.

60
0:02:54.115,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Hospice workers,

61
0:02:55.73,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the people who take care of us at the end of our lives,

62
0:02:58.665,000 --> 0:03:02,000
recently issued a report on the most frequently expressed regrets

63
0:03:03.466,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that people say when they are literally on their deathbeds.

64
0:03:07.667,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And that's what I want to share with you today --

65
0:03:09.985,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the top five regrets of the dying.

66
0:03:14.07,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Number one:

67
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I wish I hadn't worked so hard.

68
0:03:21.058,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Number two:

69
0:03:22.718,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.

70
0:03:26.606,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Number three:

71
0:03:27.761,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I wish I had let myself be happier.

72
0:03:32.982,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Number four:

73
0:03:34.193,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I wish I'd had the courage to express my true self.

74
0:03:39.084,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And number five:

75
0:03:40.553,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I wish I'd lived a life true to my dreams,

76
0:03:43.261,000 --> 0:03:45,000
instead of what others expected of me.

77
0:03:47.365,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Now, as far as I know, no one ever told one of the hospice workers,

78
0:03:50.871,000 --> 0:03:53,000
"I wish I'd spent more time playing video games,"

79
0:03:53.966,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but when I hear these top five regrets of the dying,

80
0:03:56.57,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I can't help but hear five deep human cravings

81
0:03:59.386,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that games actually help us fulfill.

82
0:04:01.41,000 --> 0:04:03,000
For example, I wish I hadn't worked so hard.

83
0:04:04.105,000 --> 0:04:06,000
For many people, this means, I wish I'd spent more time

84
0:04:06.836,000 --> 0:04:08,000
with my family, with my kids when they were growing up.

85
0:04:09.549,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Well, we know that playing games together has tremendous family benefits.

86
0:04:13.722,000 --> 0:04:16,000
A recent study from Brigham Young University School of Family Life

87
0:04:17.144,000 --> 0:04:21,000
reported that parents who spend more time playing video games with their kids

88
0:04:21.391,000 --> 0:04:24,000
have much stronger real-life relationships with them.

89
0:04:26.07,000 --> 0:04:28,000
"I wish I'd stayed in touch with my friends."

90
0:04:28.686,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Hundreds of millions of people

91
0:04:30.154,000 --> 0:04:33,000
use social games like FarmVille or Words With Friends

92
0:04:33.316,000 --> 0:04:36,000
to stay in daily contact with real-life friends and family.

93
0:04:36.645,000 --> 0:04:39,000
A recent study from the University of Michigan

94
0:04:40.137,000 --> 0:04:46,000
showed that these games are incredibly powerful relationship-management tools.

95
0:04:46.858,000 --> 0:04:49,000
They help us stay connected with people in our social network

96
0:04:50.693,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that we would otherwise grow distant from,

97
0:04:52.813,000 --> 0:04:53,000
if we weren't playing games together.

98
0:04:55.113,000 --> 0:04:56,000
"I wish I'd let myself be happier."

99
0:04:56.93,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Well, here I can't help but think of the groundbreaking clinical trials

100
0:05:00.335,000 --> 0:05:02,000
recently conducted at East Carolina University

101
0:05:03.263,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that showed that online games can outperform

102
0:05:06.138,000 --> 0:05:09,000
pharmaceuticals for treating clinical anxiety and depression.

103
0:05:10.395,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Just 30 minutes of online game play a day

104
0:05:13.411,000 --> 0:05:15,000
was enough to create dramatic boosts in mood

105
0:05:16.408,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and long-term increases in happiness.

106
0:05:20.805,000 --> 0:05:22,000
"I wish I'd had the courage to express my true self."

107
0:05:23.464,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Well, avatars are a way to express our true selves,

108
0:05:27.122,000 --> 0:05:3,000
our most heroic, idealized version of who we might become.

109
0:05:30.478,000 --> 0:05:33,000
You can see that in this alter ego portrait by Robbie Cooper

110
0:05:34.12,000 --> 0:05:36,000
of a gamer with his avatar.

111
0:05:36.62,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And Stanford University has been doing research for five years now

112
0:05:40.114,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to document how playing a game with an idealized avatar

113
0:05:44.291,000 --> 0:05:46,000
changes how we think and act in real life,

114
0:05:47.085,000 --> 0:05:49,000
making us more courageous, more ambitious,

115
0:05:50.069,000 --> 0:05:52,000
more committed to our goals.

116
0:05:53.712,000 --> 0:05:55,000
"I wish I'd led a life true to my dreams,

117
0:05:55.828,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and not what others expected of me."

118
0:05:57.658,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Are games doing this yet?

119
0:05:58.964,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I'm not sure, so I've left a Super Mario question mark.

120
0:06:02.464,000 --> 0:06:03,000
We're going to come back to this one.

121
0:06:04.805,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But in the meantime, perhaps you're wondering,

122
0:06:08.345,000 --> 0:06:1,000
who is this game designer to be talking to us

123
0:06:11.304,000 --> 0:06:12,000
about deathbed regrets?

124
0:06:13.116,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And it's true, I've never worked in a hospice,

125
0:06:16.497,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I've never been on my deathbed.

126
0:06:19.41,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But recently I did spend three months in bed, wanting to die.

127
0:06:25.616,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Really wanting to die.

128
0:06:27.496,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Now let me tell you that story.

129
0:06:29.877,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It started two years ago, when I hit my head and got a concussion.

130
0:06:33.005,000 --> 0:06:34,000
The concussion didn't heal properly,

131
0:06:34.802,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and after 30 days, I was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches,

132
0:06:38.583,000 --> 0:06:4,000
nausea, vertigo, memory loss, mental fog.

133
0:06:41.905,000 --> 0:06:43,000
My doctor told me that in order to heal my brain,

134
0:06:44.333,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I had to rest it.

135
0:06:45.381,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So I had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms.

136
0:06:48.038,000 --> 0:06:5,000
For me that meant no reading, no writing, no video games,

137
0:06:50.933,000 --> 0:06:53,000
no work or email, no running, no alcohol, no caffeine.

138
0:06:54.013,000 --> 0:06:56,000
In other words -- and I think you see where this is going --

139
0:06:57.006,000 --> 0:06:58,000
no reason to live.

140
0:06:58.11,000 --> 0:06:59,000
(Laughter)

141
0:06:59.135,000 --> 0:07:,000
Of course it's meant to be funny,

142
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:04,000
but in all seriousness, suicidal ideation is quite common

143
0:07:04.918,000 --> 0:07:05,000
with traumatic brain injuries.

144
0:07:06.881,000 --> 0:07:09,000
It happens to one in three, and it happened to me.

145
0:07:10.503,000 --> 0:07:14,000
My brain started telling me, "Jane, you want to die."

146
0:07:15.681,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It said, "You're never going to get better."

147
0:07:19.057,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It said, "The pain will never end."

148
0:07:22.644,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And these voices became so persistent and so persuasive

149
0:07:26.826,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that I started to legitimately fear for my life,

150
0:07:31.959,000 --> 0:07:35,000
which is the time that I said to myself after 34 days --

151
0:07:36.46,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and I will never forget this moment --

152
0:07:38.547,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I said, "I am either going to kill myself

153
0:07:41.954,000 --> 0:07:43,000
or I'm going to turn this into a game."

154
0:07:44.581,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Now, why a game?

155
0:07:45.75,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I knew from researching the psychology of games for more than a decade

156
0:07:49.878,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that when we play a game --

157
0:07:51.609,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and this is in the scientific literature --

158
0:07:53.664,000 --> 0:07:55,000
we tackle tough challenges with more creativity,

159
0:07:56.457,000 --> 0:07:57,000
more determination, more optimism,

160
0:07:58.158,000 --> 0:08:,000
and we're more likely to reach out to others for help.

161
0:08:00.73,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I wanted to bring these gamer traits to my real-life challenge,

162
0:08:03.773,000 --> 0:08:04,000
so I created a role-playing recovery game

163
0:08:05.793,000 --> 0:08:06,000
called Jane the Concussion Slayer.

164
0:08:07.701,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Now this became my new secret identity,

165
0:08:10.519,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and the first thing I did as a slayer was call my twin sister --

166
0:08:13.943,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I have an identical twin sister named Kelly --

167
0:08:16.275,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and tell her, "I'm playing a game to heal my brain,

168
0:08:20.017,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and I want you to play with me."

169
0:08:22.089,000 --> 0:08:25,000
This was an easier way to ask for help.

170
0:08:26.147,000 --> 0:08:28,000
She became my first ally in the game,

171
0:08:28.409,000 --> 0:08:29,000
my husband Kiyash joined next,

172
0:08:30.369,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and together we identified and battled the bad guys.

173
0:08:33.787,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Now this was anything that could trigger my symptoms

174
0:08:36.899,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and therefore slow down the healing process,

175
0:08:38.987,000 --> 0:08:4,000
things like bright lights and crowded spaces.

176
0:08:41.359,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We also collected and activated power-ups.

177
0:08:44.404,000 --> 0:08:46,000
This was anything I could do on even my worst day

178
0:08:47.365,000 --> 0:08:49,000
to feel just a little bit good,

179
0:08:49.532,000 --> 0:08:5,000
just a little bit productive.

180
0:08:51.46,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Things like cuddling my dog for 10 minutes,

181
0:08:54.177,000 --> 0:08:57,000
or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once.

182
0:08:57.469,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Now the game was that simple:

183
0:08:59.233,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Adopt a secret identity, recruit your allies,

184
0:09:02.391,000 --> 0:09:04,000
battle the bad guys, activate the power-ups.

185
0:09:05.415,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But even with a game so simple,

186
0:09:07.399,000 --> 0:09:09,000
within just a couple days of starting to play,

187
0:09:09.962,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that fog of depression and anxiety went away.

188
0:09:13.793,000 --> 0:09:15,000
It just vanished. It felt like a miracle.

189
0:09:16.253,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Now it wasn't a miracle cure for the headaches

190
0:09:18.765,000 --> 0:09:19,000
or the cognitive symptoms.

191
0:09:20.028,000 --> 0:09:21,000
That lasted for more than a year,

192
0:09:21.769,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and it was the hardest year of my life by far.

193
0:09:24.959,000 --> 0:09:26,000
But even when I still had the symptoms,

194
0:09:27.293,000 --> 0:09:3,000
even while I was still in pain, I stopped suffering.

195
0:09:31.983,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Now what happened next with the game surprised me.

196
0:09:34.459,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I put up some blog posts and videos online,

197
0:09:36.544,000 --> 0:09:37,000
explaining how to play.

198
0:09:37.989,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But not everybody has a concussion, obviously,

199
0:09:40.544,000 --> 0:09:42,000
not everyone wants to be "the slayer,"

200
0:09:42.8,000 --> 0:09:44,000
so I renamed the game SuperBetter.

201
0:09:45.5,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And soon, I started hearing from people all over the world

202
0:09:48.73,000 --> 0:09:5,000
who were adopting their own secret identity,

203
0:09:51.04,000 --> 0:09:54,000
recruiting their own allies, and they were getting "super better,"

204
0:09:54.365,000 --> 0:09:57,000
facing challenges like cancer and chronic pain,

205
0:09:58.271,000 --> 0:10:,000
depression and Crohn's disease.

206
0:10:00.604,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Even people were playing it for terminal diagnoses like ALS.

207
0:10:04.985,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And I could tell from their messages and their videos

208
0:10:08.628,000 --> 0:10:11,000
that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me.

209
0:10:12.215,000 --> 0:10:14,000
They talked about feeling stronger and braver.

210
0:10:15.546,000 --> 0:10:19,000
They talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family.

211
0:10:19.776,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And they even talked about feeling happier,

212
0:10:22.343,000 --> 0:10:24,000
even though they were in pain,

213
0:10:24.447,000 --> 0:10:27,000
even though they were tackling the toughest challenge of their lives.

214
0:10:27.838,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Now at the time, I'm thinking to myself, what is going on here?

215
0:10:31.723,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I mean, how could a game so trivial intervene so powerfully

216
0:10:36.64,000 --> 0:10:39,000
in such serious, and in some cases life-and-death, circumstances?

217
0:10:40.591,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I mean, if it hadn't worked for me,

218
0:10:42.386,000 --> 0:10:44,000
there's no way I would have believed it was possible.

219
0:10:44.917,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Well, it turns out there's some science here, too.

220
0:10:48.401,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Some people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event.

221
0:10:53.123,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And that's what was happening to us.

222
0:10:54.94,000 --> 0:10:56,000
The game was helping us experience

223
0:10:57.085,000 --> 0:11:,000
what scientists call post-traumatic growth,

224
0:11:00.239,000 --> 0:11:02,000
which is not something we usually hear about.

225
0:11:02.463,000 --> 0:11:04,000
We usually hear about post-traumatic stress disorder.

226
0:11:05.352,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But scientists now know that a traumatic event

227
0:11:07.968,000 --> 0:11:09,000
doesn't doom us to suffer indefinitely.

228
0:11:10.858,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Instead, we can use it as a springboard

229
0:11:13.222,000 --> 0:11:16,000
to unleash our best qualities and lead happier lives.

230
0:11:16.742,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Here are the top five things that people with post-traumatic growth say:

231
0:11:21.408,000 --> 0:11:22,000
"My priorities have changed."

232
0:11:22.956,000 --> 0:11:24,000
"I'm not afraid to do what makes me happy."

233
0:11:25.813,000 --> 0:11:27,000
"I feel closer to my friends and family."

234
0:11:29.083,000 --> 0:11:32,000
"I understand myself better. I know who I really am now."

235
0:11:33.123,000 --> 0:11:36,000
"I have a new sense of meaning and purpose in my life."

236
0:11:36.674,000 --> 0:11:39,000
"I'm better able to focus on my goals and dreams."

237
0:11:39.714,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Now, does this sound familiar?

238
0:11:41.833,000 --> 0:11:45,000
It should, because the top five traits of post-traumatic growth

239
0:11:46.089,000 --> 0:11:51,000
are essentially the direct opposite of the top five regrets of the dying.

240
0:11:51.603,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Now this is interesting, right?

241
0:11:53.167,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It seems that somehow, a traumatic event

242
0:11:55.887,000 --> 0:11:59,000
can unlock our ability to lead a life with fewer regrets.

243
0:12:00.051,000 --> 0:12:01,000
But how does it work?

244
0:12:01.371,000 --> 0:12:03,000
How do you get from trauma to growth?

245
0:12:03.916,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Or better yet, is there a way to get all the benefits

246
0:12:06.691,000 --> 0:12:08,000
of post-traumatic growth without the trauma,

247
0:12:09.212,000 --> 0:12:11,000
without having to hit your head in the first place?

248
0:12:11.665,000 --> 0:12:12,000
That would be good, right?

249
0:12:13.172,000 --> 0:12:15,000
I wanted to understand the phenomenon better,

250
0:12:15.571,000 --> 0:12:18,000
so I devoured the scientific literature, and here's what I learned.

251
0:12:19.127,000 --> 0:12:21,000
There are four kinds of strength, or resilience,

252
0:12:22.003,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that contribute to post-traumatic growth,

253
0:12:25.143,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and there are scientifically validated activities

254
0:12:27.741,000 --> 0:12:31,000
that you can do every day to build up these four kinds of resilience,

255
0:12:32.205,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and you don't need a trauma to do it.

256
0:12:33.998,000 --> 0:12:35,000
I could tell you what these four types of strength are,

257
0:12:36.608,000 --> 0:12:38,000
but I'd rather you experience them firsthand.

258
0:12:38.735,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I'd rather we all start building them up together right now.

259
0:12:41.708,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Here's what we're going to do.

260
0:12:43.163,000 --> 0:12:44,000
We'll play a quick game together.

261
0:12:44.964,000 --> 0:12:46,000
This is where you earn the seven and a half minutes

262
0:12:47.387,000 --> 0:12:49,000
of bonus life that I promised you earlier.

263
0:12:49.411,000 --> 0:12:51,000
All you have to do is successfully complete

264
0:12:52.082,000 --> 0:12:54,000
the first four SuperBetter quests.

265
0:12:54.423,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And I feel like you can do it. I have confidence in you.

266
0:12:57.089,000 --> 0:12:58,000
So, everybody ready?

267
0:12:58.473,000 --> 0:13:,000
This is your first quest. Here we go.

268
0:13:00.76,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Pick one: Stand up and take three steps,

269
0:13:03.516,000 --> 0:13:05,000
or make your hands into fists, raise them over your head

270
0:13:06.182,000 --> 0:13:07,000
as high as you can for five seconds, go!

271
0:13:09.964,000 --> 0:13:1,000
All right, I like the people doing both.

272
0:13:11.973,000 --> 0:13:12,000
You are overachievers. Very good.

273
0:13:13.602,000 --> 0:13:14,000
(Laughter)

274
0:13:14.695,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Well done, everyone.

275
0:13:15.742,000 --> 0:13:17,000
That is worth +1 physical resilience,

276
0:13:17.902,000 --> 0:13:19,000
which means that your body can withstand more stress

277
0:13:20.648,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and heal itself faster.

278
0:13:22.187,000 --> 0:13:23,000
We know from the research

279
0:13:23.522,000 --> 0:13:26,000
that the number one thing you can do to boost your physical resilience

280
0:13:26.912,000 --> 0:13:27,000
is to not sit still.

281
0:13:28.212,000 --> 0:13:29,000
That's all it takes.

282
0:13:29.436,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Every single second that you are not sitting still,

283
0:13:32.656,000 --> 0:13:34,000
you are actively improving the health of your heart,

284
0:13:35.448,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and your lungs and brains.

285
0:13:37.066,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Everybody ready for your next quest?

286
0:13:39.44,000 --> 0:13:41,000
I want you to snap your fingers exactly 50 times,

287
0:13:41.757,000 --> 0:13:44,000
or count backwards from 100 by seven, like this: 100, 93...

288
0:13:45.284,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Go!

289
0:13:46.321,000 --> 0:13:49,000
(Snapping)

290
0:13:49.773,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Don't give up.

291
0:13:50.86,000 --> 0:13:52,000
(Snapping)

292
0:13:53.675,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Don't let the people counting down from 100

293
0:13:55.731,000 --> 0:13:56,000
interfere with your counting to 50.

294
0:13:57.461,000 --> 0:13:59,000
(Snapping)

295
0:14:00.373,000 --> 0:14:01,000
(Laughter)

296
0:14:01.946,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Nice. Wow. That's the first time I've ever seen that.

297
0:14:05.674,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Bonus physical resilience. Well done, everyone.

298
0:14:08.65,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Now that's worth +1 mental resilience,

299
0:14:10.76,000 --> 0:14:12,000
which means you have more mental focus, more discipline,

300
0:14:13.451,000 --> 0:14:14,000
determination and willpower.

301
0:14:15.301,000 --> 0:14:16,000
We know from the scientific research

302
0:14:17.113,000 --> 0:14:19,000
that willpower actually works like a muscle.

303
0:14:19.264,000 --> 0:14:21,000
It gets stronger the more you exercise it.

304
0:14:22.039,000 --> 0:14:25,000
So tackling a tiny challenge without giving up,

305
0:14:25.415,000 --> 0:14:28,000
even one as absurd as snapping your fingers exactly 50 times

306
0:14:28.797,000 --> 0:14:29,000
or counting backwards from 100 by seven

307
0:14:30.679,000 --> 0:14:33,000
is actually a scientifically validated way to boost your willpower.

308
0:14:34.275,000 --> 0:14:35,000
So good job. Quest number three.

309
0:14:36.277,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Pick one: Because of the room, fate's really determined this for you,

310
0:14:39.565,000 --> 0:14:4,000
but here are the two options.

311
0:14:40.973,000 --> 0:14:42,000
If you're inside, find a window and look out of it.

312
0:14:43.451,000 --> 0:14:45,000
If you're outside, find a window and look in.

313
0:14:46.003,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Or do a quick YouTube or Google image search

314
0:14:48.628,000 --> 0:14:49,000
for "baby [your favorite animal.]"

315
0:14:50.424,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Do it on your phones, or just shout out some baby animals,

316
0:14:53.249,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and I'll put them on the screen.

317
0:14:54.825,000 --> 0:14:55,000
So, what do we want to see?

318
0:14:56.305,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Sloth, giraffe, elephant, snake. Okay, let's see what we got.

319
0:15:01.782,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Baby dolphin and baby llamas. Everybody look.

320
0:15:07.035,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Got that?

321
0:15:08.277,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Okay, one more. Baby elephant.

322
0:15:10.532,000 --> 0:15:11,000
(Audience) Oh!

323
0:15:11.721,000 --> 0:15:12,000
We're clapping for that?

324
0:15:13.206,000 --> 0:15:14,000
That's amazing.

325
0:15:14.414,000 --> 0:15:15,000
(Laughter)

326
0:15:15.53,000 --> 0:15:18,000
All right, what we're just feeling there is plus-one emotional resilience,

327
0:15:19.053,000 --> 0:15:21,000
which means you have the ability to provoke powerful,

328
0:15:21.579,000 --> 0:15:23,000
positive emotions like curiosity or love,

329
0:15:24.061,000 --> 0:15:25,000
which we feel looking at baby animals,

330
0:15:25.937,000 --> 0:15:26,000
when you need them most.

331
0:15:27.188,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Here's a secret from the scientific literature for you.

332
0:15:29.866,000 --> 0:15:32,000
If you can manage to experience three positive emotions

333
0:15:33.591,000 --> 0:15:35,000
for every one negative emotion

334
0:15:36.116,000 --> 0:15:38,000
over the course of an hour, a day, a week,

335
0:15:39.108,000 --> 0:15:41,000
you dramatically improve your health

336
0:15:41.204,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and your ability to successfully tackle any problem you're facing.

337
0:15:44.788,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And this is called the three-to-one positive emotion ratio.

338
0:15:48.067,000 --> 0:15:5,000
It's my favorite SuperBetter trick, so keep it up.

339
0:15:50.749,000 --> 0:15:52,000
All right, pick one, last quest:

340
0:15:52.844,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Shake someone's hand for six seconds,

341
0:15:54.7,000 --> 0:15:55,000
or send someone a quick thank you

342
0:15:56.431,000 --> 0:15:57,000
by text, email, Facebook or Twitter. Go!

343
0:15:58.361,000 --> 0:16:02,000
(Chatting)

344
0:16:03.329,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Looking good, looking good.

345
0:16:06.746,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Nice, nice.

346
0:16:08.825,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Keep it up.

347
0:16:10.607,000 --> 0:16:11,000
I love it!

348
0:16:11.632,000 --> 0:16:14,000
All right, everybody, that is +1 social resilience,

349
0:16:15.048,000 --> 0:16:18,000
which means you actually get more strength from your friends,

350
0:16:18.295,000 --> 0:16:2,000
your neighbors, your family, your community.

351
0:16:20.416,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Now, a great way to boost social resilience is gratitude.

352
0:16:23.925,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Touch is even better.

353
0:16:25.216,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Here's one more secret for you:

354
0:16:26.767,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Shaking someone's hand for six seconds

355
0:16:29.036,000 --> 0:16:32,000
dramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream,

356
0:16:32.072,000 --> 0:16:33,000
now that's the trust hormone.

357
0:16:33.938,000 --> 0:16:35,000
That means that all of you who just shook hands

358
0:16:36.187,000 --> 0:16:39,000
are biochemically primed to like and want to help each other.

359
0:16:39.599,000 --> 0:16:41,000
This will linger during the break,

360
0:16:42.151,000 --> 0:16:44,000
so take advantage of the networking opportunities.

361
0:16:44.561,000 --> 0:16:45,000
(Laughter)

362
0:16:45.631,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Well, you have successfully completed your four quests,

363
0:16:48.361,000 --> 0:16:5,000
let's see if I've successfully completed my mission

364
0:16:50.788,000 --> 0:16:52,000
to give you seven and a half minutes of bonus life.

365
0:16:53.197,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Now I get to share one more little bit of science with you.

366
0:16:56.022,000 --> 0:17:,000
It turns out that people who regularly boost these four types of resilience --

367
0:17:00.206,000 --> 0:17:02,000
physical, mental, emotional and social --

368
0:17:02.745,000 --> 0:17:04,000
live 10 years longer than everyone else.

369
0:17:05.202,000 --> 0:17:06,000
So this is true.

370
0:17:06.288,000 --> 0:17:09,000
If you are regularly achieving the three-to-one positive emotion ratio,

371
0:17:10.095,000 --> 0:17:13,000
if you are never sitting still for more than an hour at a time,

372
0:17:13.246,000 --> 0:17:16,000
if you are reaching out to one person you care about every single day,

373
0:17:17.115,000 --> 0:17:21,000
if you are tackling tiny goals to boost your willpower,

374
0:17:21.242,000 --> 0:17:23,000
you will live 10 years longer than everyone else,

375
0:17:23.593,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and here's where that math I showed you earlier comes in.

376
0:17:26.332,000 --> 0:17:29,000
So, the average life expectancy in the U.S. and the U.K. is 78.1 years,

377
0:17:30.355,000 --> 0:17:33,000
but we know from more than 1,000 peer-reviewed scientific studies

378
0:17:33.483,000 --> 0:17:36,000
that you can add 10 years of life by boosting your four types of resilience.

379
0:17:37.102,000 --> 0:17:4,000
So every single year that you are boosting your four types of resilience,

380
0:17:40.661,000 --> 0:17:42,000
you're actually earning .128 more years of life

381
0:17:42.934,000 --> 0:17:46,000
or 46 more days of life, or 67,298 more minutes of life,

382
0:17:47.507,000 --> 0:17:51,000
which means every single day, you are earning 184 minutes of life,

383
0:17:51.821,000 --> 0:17:54,000
or every single hour that you are boosting your four types of resilience,

384
0:17:55.322,000 --> 0:17:58,000
like we just did together, you are earning 7.68245837

385
0:17:58.587,000 --> 0:17:59,000
more minutes of life.

386
0:17:59.682,000 --> 0:18:01,000
Congratulations, those seven and a half minutes are all yours.

387
0:18:02.618,000 --> 0:18:03,000
You totally earned them.

388
0:18:04.118,000 --> 0:18:05,000
Yeah!

389
0:18:05.149,000 --> 0:18:06,000
(Applause)

390
0:18:06.467,000 --> 0:18:07,000
Awesome.

391
0:18:08.294,000 --> 0:18:09,000
Wait, wait, wait.

392
0:18:10.909,000 --> 0:18:13,000
You still have your special mission, your secret mission.

393
0:18:14.064,000 --> 0:18:17,000
How are you going to spend these minutes of bonus life?

394
0:18:17.128,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Well, here's my suggestion.

395
0:18:18.845,000 --> 0:18:21,000
These seven and a half bonus minutes are kind of like genie's wishes.

396
0:18:22.487,000 --> 0:18:25,000
You can use your first wish to wish for a million more wishes.

397
0:18:25.985,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Pretty clever, right?

398
0:18:27.056,000 --> 0:18:3,000
So, if you spend these seven and a half minutes today

399
0:18:30.911,000 --> 0:18:32,000
doing something that makes you happy,

400
0:18:33.545,000 --> 0:18:34,000
or that gets you physically active,

401
0:18:35.288,000 --> 0:18:38,000
or puts you in touch with someone you care about,

402
0:18:38.391,000 --> 0:18:4,000
or even just tackling a tiny challenge,

403
0:18:41.224,000 --> 0:18:44,000
you're going to boost your resilience, so you're going to earn more minutes.

404
0:18:44.873,000 --> 0:18:46,000
And the good news is, you can keep going like that.

405
0:18:47.352,000 --> 0:18:49,000
Every hour of the day, every day of your life,

406
0:18:49.656,000 --> 0:18:5,000
all the way to your deathbed,

407
0:18:51.088,000 --> 0:18:53,000
which will now be 10 years later than it would have otherwise.

408
0:18:54.341,000 --> 0:18:57,000
And when you get there, more than likely,

409
0:18:57.523,000 --> 0:19:,000
you will not have any of those top five regrets,

410
0:19:01.063,000 --> 0:19:03,000
because you will have built up the strength and resilience

411
0:19:03.936,000 --> 0:19:05,000
to lead a life truer to your dreams.

412
0:19:07.396,000 --> 0:19:1,000
And with 10 extra years, you might even have enough time

413
0:19:10.659,000 --> 0:19:11,000
to play a few more games.

414
0:19:12.602,000 --> 0:19:13,000
Thank you.

415
0:19:13.705,000 --> 0:19:15,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So, I'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
But before I do that,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
which require huge amounts of energy to create

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and, because of their disposal issues,

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
are slowly poisoning our planet.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I also want to tell you and share with you

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
how my team and I

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
have been using mushrooms over the last three years.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Not like that. (Laughter)

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We're using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials,

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
which perform a lot like plastics during their use,

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but are made from crop waste

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and are totally compostable at the end of their lives.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Cheering)

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But first,

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
I need to talk to you about what I consider one of the most egregious offenders

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in the disposable plastics category.

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
This is a material you all know is Styrofoam,

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
but I like to think of it as toxic white stuff.

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
In a single cubic foot of this material --

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
about what would come around your computer or large television --

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
you have the same energy content

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
of about a liter and a half of petrol.

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Yet, after just a few weeks of use,

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
you'll throw this material in the trash.

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And this isn't just found in packaging.

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
20 billion dollars of this material is produced every year,

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
in everything from building materials to surfboards

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to coffee cups to table tops.

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And that's not the only place it's found.

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
The EPA estimates, in the United States,

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
by volume, this material occupies 25 percent of our landfills.

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment --

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
on the side of the road or next to a river.

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
If it's not picked up by a human, like me and you,

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
it'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years.

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Perhaps even worse

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is when it finds its way into our oceans, like in the great plastic gyre,

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
where these materials are being mechanically broken

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
into smaller and smaller bits,

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
but they're not really going away.

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
They're not biologically compatible.

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
They're basically fouling up

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Earth's respiratory and circulatory systems.

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And because these materials are so prolific,

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
because they're found in so many places,

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
there's one other place you'll find this material, styrene,

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
which is made from benzene, a known carcinogen.

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
You'll find it inside of you.

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So, for all these reasons,

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I think we need better materials,

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials.

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The first is feedstocks.

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Today, we use a single feedstock, petroleum,

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to heat our homes, power our cars

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and make most of the materials you see around you.

59
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We recognize this is a finite resource,

60
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and it's simply crazy to do this, to put a liter and a half of petrol in the trash

61
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
every time you get a package.

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Second of all, we should really strive to use far less energy

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
in creating these materials.

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I say far less, because 10 percent isn't going to cut it.

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We should be talking about half, a quarter,

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
one-tenth the energy content.

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And lastly, and I think perhaps most importantly,

68
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we should be creating materials

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that fit into what I call nature's recycling system.

70
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
This recycling system has been in place for the last billion years.

71
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I fit into it, you fit into it,

72
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and a hundred years tops, my body can return to the Earth with no preprocessing.

73
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Yet that packaging I got in the mail yesterday

74
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
is going to last for thousands of years.

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
This is crazy.

76
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But nature provides us with a really good model here.

77
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
When a tree's done using its leaves --

78
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
its solar collectors, these amazing molecular photon capturing devices --

79
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
at the end of a season,

80
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
it doesn't pack them up, take them to the leaf reprocessing center

81
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and have them melted down to form new leaves.

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It just drops them, the shortest distance possible,

83
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to the forest floor,

84
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
where they're actually upcycled into next year's topsoil.

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And this gets us back to the mushrooms.

86
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Because in nature,

87
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
mushrooms are the recycling system.

88
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And what we've discovered

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
is, by using a part of the mushroom you've probably never seen --

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
analogous to its root structure; it's called mycelium --

91
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
we can actually grow materials

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
with many of the same properties of conventional synthetics.

93
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Now, mycelium is an amazing material,

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
because it's a self-assembling material.

95
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It actually takes things we would consider waste --

96
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
things like seed husks or woody biomass --

97
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and can transform them into a chitinous polymer,

98
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
which you can form into almost any shape.

99
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
In our process,

100
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
we basically use it as a glue.

101
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And by using mycelium as a glue,

102
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
you can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry,

103
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and you can create materials with many different properties,

104
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
materials that are insulating, fire-resistant,

105
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
moisture-resistant, vapor-resistant --

106
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
materials that can absorb impacts, that can absorb acoustical impacts.

107
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts,

108
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
not petroleum.

109
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And because they're made of natural materials,

110
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
they are 100 percent compostable

111
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
in you own backyard.

112
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So I'd like to share with you the four basic steps

113
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
required to make these materials.

114
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The first is selecting a feedstock,

115
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
preferably something that's regional, that's in your area, right --

116
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
local manufacturing.

117
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
The next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool,

118
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
physically filling an enclosure, a mold,

119
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
in whatever shape you want to get.

120
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Then you actually grow the mycelium through these particles,

121
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and that's where the magic happens,

122
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
because the organism is doing the work in this process,

123
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
not the equipment.

124
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
The final step is, of course, the product,

125
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
whether it's a packaging material, a table top, or building block.

126
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Our vision is local manufacturing,

127
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
like the local food movement, for production.

128
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So we've created formulations for all around the world

129
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
using regional byproducts.

130
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
If you're in China, you might use a rice husk

131
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
or a cottonseed hull.

132
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
If you're in Northern Europe or North America,

133
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls.

134
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We then process these husks with some basic equipment.

135
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And I want to share with you a quick video from our facility

136
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that gives you a sense of how this looks at scale.

137
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So what you're seeing here is actually cotton hulls from Texas, in this case.

138
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
It's a waste product.

139
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And what they're doing in our equipment

140
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
is going through a continuous system,

141
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
which cleans, cooks, cools

142
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and pasteurizes these materials,

143
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
while also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium.

144
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
This gives us a continuous stream of material

145
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that we can put into almost any shape,

146
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
though today we're making corner blocks.

147
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And it's when this lid goes on the part,

148
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that the magic really starts.

149
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Because the manufacturing process is our organism.

150
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It'll actually begin to digest these wastes

151
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and, over the next five days,

152
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
assemble them into biocomposites.

153
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Our entire facility

154
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
is comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools

155
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
sitting indoors in the dark, quietly self-assembling materials --

156
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and everything from building materials

157
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
to, in this case,

158
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
a packaging corner block.

159
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So I've said a number of times that we grow materials.

160
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And it's kind of hard to picture how that happens.

161
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So my team has taken five days-worth of growth,

162
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
a typical growth cycle for us,

163
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and condensed it into a 15-second time lapse.

164
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And I want you to really watch closely

165
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
these little white dots on the screen,

166
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
because, over the five-day period,

167
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
what they do is extend out and through this material,

168
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
using the energy that's contained in these seed husks

169
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to build this chitinous polymer matrix.

170
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
This matrix self-assembles,

171
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
growing through and around the particles,

172
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
making millions and millions of tiny fibers.

173
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And what parts of the seed husk we don't digest,

174
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
actually become part of the final, physical composite.

175
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So in front of your eyes, this part just self-assembled.

176
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It actually takes a little longer. It takes five days.

177
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But it's much faster than conventional farming.

178
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The last step, of course, is application.

179
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
In this case, we've grown a corner block.

180
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
A major Fortune 500 furniture maker

181
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
uses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment.

182
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
They used to use a plastic packaging buffer,

183
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance

184
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
with our grown material.

185
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Best of all, when it gets to the customer,

186
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
it's not trash.

187
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
They can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing,

188
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and it's going to improve the local soil.

189
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So, why mycelium?

190
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
The first reason is local open feedstocks.

191
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
You want to be able to do this anywhere in the world

192
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls,

193
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
because you have multiple choices.

194
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The next is self-assembly,

195
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process.

196
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
You don't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility.

197
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So you can have lots of small facilities

198
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
spread all across the world.

199
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Biological yield is really important.

200
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And because 100 percent of what we put in the tool become the final product,

201
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
even the parts that aren't digested

202
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
become part of the structure,

203
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
we're getting incredible yield rates.

204
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Natural polymers, well ... I think that's what's most important,

205
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
because these polymers have been tried and tested

206
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
in our ecosystem for the last billion years,

207
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
in everything from mushrooms to crustaceans.

208
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
They're not going to clog up Earth's ecosystems. They work great.

209
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And while, today,

210
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
we can practically guarantee that yesterday's packaging

211
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
is going to be here in 10,000 years,

212
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
what I want to guarantee

213
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
is that in 10,000 years,

214
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
our descendants, our children's children,

215
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
will be living happily and in harmony

216
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
with a healthy Earth.

217
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And I think that can be some really good news.

218
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Thank you.

219
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Applause)

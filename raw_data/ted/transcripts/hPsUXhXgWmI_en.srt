1
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
One thing the world needs,

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
one thing this country desperately needs

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
is a better way

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
of conducting our political debates.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
We need to rediscover

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the lost art of democratic argument.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Applause)

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
If you think about the arguments we have,

9
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
most of the time it's shouting matches

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
on cable television,

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
ideological food fights on the floor of Congress.

12
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I have a suggestion.

13
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Look at all the arguments we have these days

14
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
over health care,

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street,

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
over the gap between rich and poor,

17
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
over affirmative action and same-sex marriage.

18
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Lying just beneath the surface

19
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
of those arguments,

20
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
with passions raging on all sides,

21
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
are big questions

22
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
of moral philosophy,

23
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
big questions of justice.

24
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But we too rarely

25
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
articulate and defend

26
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and argue about

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
those big moral questions in our politics.

28
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So what I would like to do today

29
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
is have something of a discussion.

30
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
First, let me take

31
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
a famous philosopher

32
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
who wrote about those questions

33
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
of justice and morality,

34
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
give you a very short lecture

35
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
on Aristotle of ancient Athens,

36
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Aristotle's theory of justice,

37
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and then have a discussion here

38
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
to see whether Aristotle's ideas

39
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
actually inform

40
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
the way we think and argue

41
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
about questions today.

42
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So, are you ready for the lecture?

43
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
According to Aristotle,

44
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
justice means giving people what they deserve.

45
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
That's it; that's the lecture.

46
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now, you may say, well, that's obvious enough.

48
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
The real questions begin

49
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
when it comes to arguing about

50
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
who deserves what and why.

51
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Take the example of flutes.

52
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Suppose we're distributing flutes.

53
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Who should get the best ones?

54
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Let's see what people --

55
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
What would you say?

56
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Who should get the best flute?

57
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
You can just call it out.

58
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Audience: Random.)

59
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Michael Sandel: At random. You would do it by lottery.

60
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them.

61
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Who else?

62
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Audience: The best flute players.)

63
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
MS: The best flute players. (Audience: The worst flute players.)

64
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
MS: The worst flute players.

65
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
How many say the best flute players?

66
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Why?

67
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Actually, that was Aristotle's answer too.

68
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But here's a harder question.

70
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Why do you think,

71
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
those of you who voted this way,

72
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that the best flutes should go to the best flute players?

73
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Peter: The greatest benefit to all.

74
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
MS: The greatest benefit to all.

75
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We'll hear better music

76
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
if the best flutes should go to the best flute players.

77
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
That's Peter? (Audience: Peter.)

78
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
MS: All right.

79
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Well, it's a good reason.

80
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We'll all be better off if good music is played

81
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
rather than terrible music.

82
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But Peter,

83
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Aristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason.

84
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
That's all right.

85
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Aristotle had a different reason

86
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players.

87
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
He said,

88
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that's what flutes are for --

89
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to be played well.

90
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
He says that to reason about

91
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
just distribution of a thing,

92
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
we have to reason about,

93
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and sometimes argue about,

94
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
the purpose of the thing,

95
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
or the social activity --

96
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
in this case, musical performance.

97
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And the point, the essential nature,

98
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
of musical performance

99
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
is to produce excellent music.

100
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It'll be a happy byproduct

101
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that we'll all benefit.

102
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But when we think about justice,

103
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Aristotle says,

104
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
what we really need to think about

105
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
is the essential nature of the activity in question

106
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and the qualities that are worth

107
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
honoring and admiring and recognizing.

108
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
One of the reasons

109
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that the best flute players should get the best flutes

110
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
is that musical performance

111
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
is not only to make the rest of us happy,

112
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but to honor

113
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and recognize

114
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
the excellence

115
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
of the best musicians.

116
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Now, flutes may seem ... the distribution of flutes

117
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
may seem a trivial case.

118
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Let's take a contemporary example

119
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
of the dispute about justice.

120
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It had to do with golf.

121
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Casey Martin -- a few years ago,

122
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Casey Martin --

123
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
did any of you hear about him?

124
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
He was a very good golfer,

125
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
but he had a disability.

126
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
He had a bad leg, a circulatory problem,

127
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that made it very painful

128
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
for him to walk the course.

129
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
In fact, it carried risk of injury.

130
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
He asked the PGA,

131
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
the Professional Golfers' Association,

132
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
for permission to use a golf cart

133
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
in the PGA tournaments.

134
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
They said, "No.

135
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Now that would give you an unfair advantage."

136
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
He sued,

137
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and his case went all the way

138
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to the Supreme Court, believe it or not,

139
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
the case over the golf cart,

140
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
because the law says

141
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that the disabled

142
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
must be accommodated,

143
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
provided the accommodation does not

144
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
change the essential nature

145
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
of the activity.

146
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
He says, "I'm a great golfer.

147
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I want to compete.

148
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
But I need a golf cart

149
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
to get from one hole to the next."

150
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Suppose you were

151
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
on the Supreme Court.

152
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Suppose you were deciding

153
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
the justice of this case.

154
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
How many here would say

155
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart?

156
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And how many say, no, he doesn't?

157
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
All right, let's take a poll, show of hands.

158
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin?

159
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And how many would not? How many would say he doesn't?

160
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
All right, we have a good division of opinion here.

161
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Someone who would not

162
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart,

163
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
what would be your reason?

164
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Raise your hand, and we'll try to get you a microphone.

165
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
What would be your reason?

166
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Audience: It'd be an unfair advantage.)

167
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
MS: It would be an unfair advantage

168
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
if he gets to ride in a golf cart.

169
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
All right, those of you,

170
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart

171
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
worry about an unfair advantage.

172
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
What about those of you who say

173
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
he should be given a golf cart?

174
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
How would you answer the objection?

175
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Yes, all right.

176
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Audience: The cart's not part of the game.

177
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
MS: What's your name? (Audience: Charlie.)

178
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
MS: Charlie says --

179
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We'll get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply.

180
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Tell us, Charlie,

181
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart?

182
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Charlie: The cart's not part of the game.

183
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
MS: But what about walking from hole to hole?

184
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Charlie: It doesn't matter; it's not part of the game.

185
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
MS: Walking the course is not part of the game of golf?

186
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Charlie: Not in my book, it isn't.

187
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
MS: All right. Stay there, Charlie.

188
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
(Laughter)

189
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Who has an answer for Charlie?

190
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
All right, who has an answer for Charlie?

191
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
What would you say?

192
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Audience: The endurance element is a very important part of the game,

193
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
walking all those holes.

194
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
MS: Walking all those holes?

195
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
That's part of the game of golf? (Audience: Absolutely.)

196
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
MS: What's your name? (Audience: Warren.)

197
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
MS: Warren.

198
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Charlie, what do you say to Warren?

199
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Charley: I'll stick to my original thesis.

200
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
(Laughter)

201
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
MS: Warren, are you a golfer?

202
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Warren: I am not a golfer.

203
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Charley: And I am. (MS: Okay.)

204
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
(Laughter)

205
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
(Applause)

206
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
You know,

207
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
it's interesting.

208
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
In the case, in the lower court,

209
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
they brought in golfing greats

210
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to testify on this very issue.

211
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Is walking the course essential to the game?

212
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer.

213
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And what do you suppose they all said?

214
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Yes. They agreed with Warren.

215
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
They said, yes, walking the course

216
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
is strenuous physical exercise.

217
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
The fatigue factor is an important part of golf.

218
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And so it would change

219
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
the fundamental nature of the game

220
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
to give him the golf cart.

221
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Now, notice,

222
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
something interesting --

223
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Well, I should tell you about the Supreme Court first.

224
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
The Supreme Court

225
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
decided.

226
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
What do you suppose they said?

227
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
They said yes,

228
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart.

229
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Seven to two, they ruled.

230
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
What was interesting about their ruling

231
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and about the discussion we've just had

232
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
is that the discussion about

233
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
the right, the justice, of the matter

234
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
depended on

235
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
figuring out what is

236
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
the essential nature of golf.

237
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And the Supreme Court justices

238
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
wrestled with that question.

239
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And Justice Stevens, writing for the majority,

240
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
said he had read all about the history of golf,

241
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and the essential point of the game

242
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
is to get very small ball from one place

243
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
into a hole

244
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
in as few strokes as possible,

245
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and that walking was not essential, but incidental.

246
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Now, there were two dissenters,

247
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
one of whom was Justice Scalia.

248
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
He wouldn't have granted the cart,

249
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and he had a very interesting dissent.

250
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
It's interesting because

251
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
he rejected the Aristotelian premise

252
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
underlying the majority's opinion.

253
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
He said it's not possible

254
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
to determine the essential nature

255
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
of a game like golf.

256
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Here's how he put it.

257
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
"To say that something is essential

258
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
is ordinarily to say that it is necessary

259
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
to the achievement of a certain object.

260
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
But since it is the very nature of a game

261
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
to have no object except amusement,

262
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
(Laughter)

263
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
that is, what distinguishes games

264
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
from productive activity,

265
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
(Laughter)

266
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
it is quite impossible to say

267
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that any of a game's arbitrary rules

268
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
is essential."

269
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So there you have Justice Scalia

270
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
taking on the Aristotelian premise

271
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
of the majority's opinion.

272
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Justice Scalia's opinion

273
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
is questionable

274
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
for two reasons.

275
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
First, no real sports fan would talk that way.

276
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
(Laughter)

277
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
If we had thought that the rules

278
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
of the sports we care about

279
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
are merely arbitrary,

280
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
rather than designed to call forth

281
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
the virtues and the excellences

282
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
that we think are worthy of admiring,

283
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
we wouldn't care about the outcome of the game.

284
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
It's also objectionable

285
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
on a second ground.

286
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
On the face of it,

287
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
it seemed to be -- this debate about the golf cart --

288
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
an argument about fairness,

289
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
what's an unfair advantage.

290
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
But if fairness were the only thing at stake,

291
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
there would have been an easy and obvious solution.

292
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
What would it be? (Audience: Let everyone use the cart.)

293
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Let everyone ride in a golf cart

294
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
if they want to.

295
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Then the fairness objection goes away.

296
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
But letting everyone ride in a cart

297
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
would have been, I suspect,

298
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
more anathema

299
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
to the golfing greats

300
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and to the PGA,

301
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
even than making an exception for Casey Martin.

302
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Why?

303
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
Because what was at stake

304
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
in the dispute over the golf cart

305
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
was not only the essential nature of golf,

306
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
but, relatedly, the question:

307
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
What abilities

308
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
are worthy

309
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
of honor and recognition

310
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
as athletic talents?

311
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Let me put the point

312
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
as delicately as possible:

313
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Golfers are a little sensitive

314
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
about the athletic status of their game.

315
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
(Laughter)

316
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
After all, there's no running or jumping,

317
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and the ball stands still.

318
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
(Laughter)

319
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
So if golfing is the kind of game

320
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
that can be played while riding around in a golf cart,

321
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
it would be hard to confer

322
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
on the golfing greats

323
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
the status that we confer,

324
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
the honor and recognition

325
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
that goes to truly great athletes.

326
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
That illustrates

327
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
that with golf,

328
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
as with flutes,

329
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
it's hard to decide the question

330
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
of what justice requires,

331
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
without grappling with the question,

332
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
"What is the essential nature

333
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
of the activity in question,

334
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and what qualities,

335
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
what excellences

336
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
connected with that activity,

337
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
are worthy of honor and recognition?"

338
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Let's take a final example

339
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
that's prominent in contemporary political debate:

340
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
same-sex marriage.

341
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
There are those who favor state recognition

342
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
only of traditional marriage

343
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
between one man and one woman,

344
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and there are those who favor state recognition

345
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
of same-sex marriage.

346
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
How many here

347
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
favor the first policy:

348
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
the state should recognize traditional marriage only?

349
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And how many favor the second, same-sex marriage?

350
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Now, put it this way:

351
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
What ways of thinking

352
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
about justice and morality

353
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
underlie the arguments we have

354
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
over marriage?

355
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
The opponents of same-sex marriage say

356
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
that the purpose of marriage,

357
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
fundamentally, is procreation,

358
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and that's what's worthy of honoring

359
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and recognizing and encouraging.

360
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And the defenders of same-sex marriage say no,

361
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
procreation is not the only purpose of marriage;

362
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
what about a lifelong, mutual, loving commitment?

363
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
That's really what marriage is about.

364
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
So with flutes, with golf carts,

365
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and even with a fiercely contested question

366
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
like same-sex marriage,

367
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Aristotle has a point.

368
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Very hard to argue about justice

369
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
without first arguing

370
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
about the purpose of social institutions

371
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and about what qualities are worthy

372
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
of honor and recognition.

373
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
So let's step back from these cases

374
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and see how they shed light

375
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
on the way we might improve, elevate,

376
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
the terms of political discourse

377
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
in the United States,

378
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and for that matter, around the world.

379
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
There is a tendency to think

380
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
that if we engage too directly

381
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
with moral questions in politics,

382
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
that's a recipe for disagreement,

383
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and for that matter, a recipe for

384
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
intolerance and coercion.

385
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
So better to shy away from,

386
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
to ignore,

387
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
the moral and the religious convictions

388
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
that people bring to civic life.

389
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
It seems to me that our discussion

390
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
reflects the opposite,

391
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
that a better way

392
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
to mutual respect

393
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
is to engage directly

394
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
with the moral convictions

395
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
citizens bring to public life,

396
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
rather than to require

397
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
that people leave their deepest moral convictions

398
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
outside politics

399
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
before they enter.

400
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
That, it seems to me, is a way

401
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
to begin to restore

402
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
the art of democratic argument.

403
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Thank you very much.

404
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
(Applause)

405
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Thank you.

406
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
(Applause)

407
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Thank you.

408
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
(Applause)

409
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Thank you very much.

410
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
Thanks. Thank you.

411
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Chris.

412
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Thanks, Chris.

413
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Chris Anderson: From flutes to golf courses

414
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
to same-sex marriage --

415
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
that was a genius link.

416
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
Now look, you're a pioneer of open education.

417
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
Your lecture series was one of the first to do it big.

418
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
What's your vision for the next phase of this?

419
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
MS: Well, I think that it is possible.

420
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
In the classroom, we have arguments

421
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
on some of the most fiercely held

422
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
moral convictions that students have

423
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
about big public questions.

424
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
And I think we can do that in public life more generally.

425
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
And so my real dream would be

426
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
to take the public television series

427
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
that we've created of the course --

428
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
it's available now, online,

429
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
free for everyone anywhere in the world --

430
0:18:24.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
and to see whether we can partner with institutions,

431
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
at universities in China, in India,

432
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
in Africa, around the world,

433
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
to try to promote

434
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
civic education

435
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
and also a richer kind

436
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
of democratic debate.

437
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
CA: So you picture, at some point,

438
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
live, in real time,

439
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
you could have this kind of conversation, inviting questions,

440
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
but with people from China and India joining in?

441
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
MS: Right. We did a little bit of it here

442
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
with 1,500 people in Long Beach,

443
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
and we do it in a classroom at Harvard

444
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:,000
with about 1,000 students.

445
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
Wouldn't it be interesting

446
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:05,000
to take this way

447
0:19:05.26,000 --> 0:19:07,000
of thinking and arguing,

448
0:19:07.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
engaging seriously with big moral questions,

449
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
exploring cultural differences

450
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
and connect through a live video hookup,

451
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
students in Beijing and Mumbai

452
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
and in Cambridge, Massachusetts

453
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:22,000
and create a global classroom.

454
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:24,000
That's what I would love to do.

455
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
(Applause)

456
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
CA: So, I would imagine

457
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:33,000
that there are a lot of people who would love to join you in that endeavor.

458
0:19:33.26,000 --> 0:19:35,000
Michael Sandel. Thank you so much. (MS: Thanks so much.)

0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
In 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar.

2
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Millions of people were in severe need of help.

3
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area.

4
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But there were no maps, no maps of roads,

5
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
no maps showing hospitals, no way for help to reach the cyclone victims.

6
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London,

7
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
it is hard to believe

8
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that as of 2005, only 15 percent of the world

9
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail.

10
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem

11
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that the majority of the world's populous faces:

12
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
not having detailed maps.

13
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But help was coming.

14
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
At Google, 40 volunteers

15
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
used a new software

16
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
to map 120,000 kilometers of roads,

17
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
3,000 hospitals, logistics and relief points.

18
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And it took them four days.

19
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
The new software they used? Google Mapmaker.

20
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us

21
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to map what we know locally.

22
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
People have used this software

23
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to map everything from roads to rivers,

24
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
from schools to local businesses,

25
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and video stores to the corner store.

26
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Maps matter.

27
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto

28
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
recognized that the key to economic liftoff

29
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
for most developing countries

30
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land.

31
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
For example, a trillion dollars

32
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone.

33
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
In the last year alone,

34
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
thousands of users in 170 countries

35
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
have mapped millions of pieces of information,

36
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable.

37
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And this was made possible by

38
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
the power of passionate users everywhere.

39
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Let's look at some of the maps

40
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
being created by users right now.

41
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So, as we speak, people are mapping the world

42
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in these 170 countries.

43
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal.

44
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And, closer to home, Chalua, an N.G. road in Bangalore.

45
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
This is the result of computational geometry,

46
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
gesture recognition, and machine learning.

47
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
This is a victory of thousands of users,

48
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
in hundreds of cities,

49
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
one user, one edit at a time.

50
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
This is an invitation to the 70 percent

51
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
of our unmapped planet.

52
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Welcome to the new world.

53
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000

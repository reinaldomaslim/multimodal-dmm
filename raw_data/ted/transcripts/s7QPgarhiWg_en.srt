2
0:00:13.714,000 --> 0:00:15,000
We are all atomically connected.

3
0:00:16.913,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Fundamentally, universally.

4
0:00:19.888,000 --> 0:00:2,000
But what does that mean?

5
0:00:22.673,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I'm an astrophysicist, and as such,

6
0:00:25.649,000 --> 0:00:29,000
it is my responsibility to trace the cosmic history

7
0:00:29.708,000 --> 0:00:31,000
of every single one of your atoms.

8
0:00:33.394,000 --> 0:00:35,000
In fact, I would say

9
0:00:35.637,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that one of the greatest achievements of modern astronomy

10
0:00:39.22,000 --> 0:00:44,000
is the understanding of how our atoms were actually put together.

11
0:00:45.823,000 --> 0:00:47,000
While hydrogen and helium were made

12
0:00:48.688,000 --> 0:00:51,000
during the first two minutes of the big bang,

13
0:00:51.784,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the origin of heavy elements,

14
0:00:54.204,000 --> 0:00:58,000
such as the iron in your blood, the oxygen we're breathing,

15
0:00:58.538,000 --> 0:01:,000
the silicone in your computers,

16
0:01:00.847,000 --> 0:01:03,000
lies in the life cycle of stars.

17
0:01:05.388,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Nuclear reactions take lighter elements and transform them into heavier ones,

18
0:01:11.435,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and that causes stars to shine

19
0:01:13.967,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and ultimately explode,

20
0:01:16.084,000 --> 0:01:21,000
therefore enriching the universe with these heavy elements.

21
0:01:21.966,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So without stellar death

22
0:01:27.101,000 --> 0:01:29,000
there would be no oxygen

23
0:01:29.315,000 --> 0:01:32,000
or other elements heavier than hydrogen and helium,

24
0:01:32.91,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and therefore, there would be no life.

25
0:01:36.149,000 --> 0:01:39,000
There are more atoms in our bodies

26
0:01:39.729,000 --> 0:01:4,000
than stars in the universe.

27
0:01:42.642,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And these atoms are extremely durable.

28
0:01:45.737,000 --> 0:01:47,000
The origins of our atoms

29
0:01:47.928,000 --> 0:01:52,000
can be traceable to stars that manufactured them in their interiors

30
0:01:53.309,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and exploded them all across the Milky Way,

31
0:01:57.554,000 --> 0:01:58,000
billions of years ago.

32
0:02:00.006,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And I should know this,

33
0:02:01.458,000 --> 0:02:04,000
because I am indeed a certified stellar mortician.

34
0:02:04.884,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

35
0:02:06.387,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And today, I want to take you on a journey that starts in a supernova explosion

36
0:02:12.157,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and ends with the air that we're breathing right now.

37
0:02:18.578,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So what is our body made of?

38
0:02:21.189,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Ninety-six percent consists of only four elements:

39
0:02:27.49,000 --> 0:02:3,000
hydrogen, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen.

40
0:02:33.22,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Now the main character of this cosmic tale is oxygen.

41
0:02:39.061,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Not only is the vast majority of our bodies made of oxygen,

42
0:02:43.816,000 --> 0:02:47,000
but oxygen is the one element fighting to protect life on earth.

43
0:02:49.49,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The vast majority of oxygen in the universe

44
0:02:51.879,000 --> 0:02:56,000
was indeed produced over the entire history of the universe

45
0:02:56.95,000 --> 0:02:58,000
in these supernova explosions.

46
0:02:59.76,000 --> 0:03:03,000
These supernova explosions signal the demise of very massive stars.

47
0:03:04.474,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And for a brilliant month,

48
0:03:06.831,000 --> 0:03:1,000
one supernova explosion can be brighter than an entire galaxy

49
0:03:11.03,000 --> 0:03:13,000
containing billions of stars.

50
0:03:13.823,000 --> 0:03:14,000
That is truly remarkable.

51
0:03:17.046,000 --> 0:03:21,000
That is because massive stars burn brighter

52
0:03:21.95,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and have a spectacular death, compared to other stars.

53
0:03:26.728,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Nuclear fusion is really the lifeblood of all stars,

54
0:03:30.268,000 --> 0:03:31,000
including the sun,

55
0:03:31.891,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and as a result is the root source of all the energy on earth.

56
0:03:37.724,000 --> 0:03:41,000
You can think of stars as these fusion factories

57
0:03:42.061,000 --> 0:03:44,000
which are powered by smashing atoms together

58
0:03:45.03,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in their hot and dense interiors.

59
0:03:47.641,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Now, stars like our sun,

60
0:03:50.22,000 --> 0:03:51,000
which are relatively small,

61
0:03:51.728,000 --> 0:03:53,000
burn hydrogen into helium,

62
0:03:53.966,000 --> 0:03:56,000
but heavier stars of about eight times the mass of the sun

63
0:03:57.775,000 --> 0:03:59,000
continue this burning cycle

64
0:04:00.275,000 --> 0:04:03,000
even after they exhausted their helium in their cores.

65
0:04:05.386,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So at this point,

66
0:04:07.292,000 --> 0:04:1,000
the massive star is left with a carbon core,

67
0:04:10.482,000 --> 0:04:13,000
which, as you know, is the building block of life.

68
0:04:14.784,000 --> 0:04:17,000
This carbon core continues to collapse

69
0:04:18.538,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and as a result, the temperature increases,

70
0:04:21.069,000 --> 0:04:24,000
which allows further nuclear reactions to take place,

71
0:04:25.047,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and carbon then burns into oxygen,

72
0:04:27.699,000 --> 0:04:3,000
into neon, silicon, sulphur

73
0:04:31.389,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and ultimately iron.

74
0:04:33.667,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And iron is the end.

75
0:04:36.569,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Why?

76
0:04:37.743,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Because iron is the most bound nuclei in the universe,

77
0:04:40.302,000 --> 0:04:44,000
which means that we cannot extract energy by burning iron.

78
0:04:45.268,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So when the entire core of the massive star is made of iron,

79
0:04:50.95,000 --> 0:04:51,000
it's run out of fuel.

80
0:04:52.871,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And that's an incredibly bad day for a star.

81
0:04:56.03,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

82
0:05:00.395,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Without fuel, it cannot generate heat,

83
0:05:04.434,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and therefore gravity has won the battle.

84
0:05:08.228,000 --> 0:05:11,000
The iron core has no other choice but to collapse,

85
0:05:11.974,000 --> 0:05:13,000
reaching incredibly high densities.

86
0:05:15.363,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Think of 300 million tons

87
0:05:18.68,000 --> 0:05:21,000
reduced to a space the size of a sugar cube.

88
0:05:22.458,000 --> 0:05:26,000
At these extreme high densities, the core actually resists collapse,

89
0:05:27.091,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and as a result,

90
0:05:28.71,000 --> 0:05:31,000
all of this infalling material bounces off the core.

91
0:05:33.551,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And this dramatic bounce,

92
0:05:34.84,000 --> 0:05:37,000
which happens in a fraction of a second or so,

93
0:05:38.831,000 --> 0:05:43,000
is responsible for ejecting the rest of the star in all directions,

94
0:05:44.688,000 --> 0:05:46,000
ultimately forming a supernova explosion.

95
0:05:50.45,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So, sadly, from the perspective of an astrophysicist,

96
0:05:55.704,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the conditions in the centers of these exploding stars

97
0:05:59.127,000 --> 0:06:01,000
cannot be recreated in a laboratory.

98
0:06:01.434,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Laughter)

99
0:06:02.466,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Now, thankfully for humanity, we're not able to do that.

100
0:06:06.109,000 --> 0:06:07,000
(Laughter)

101
0:06:07.839,000 --> 0:06:08,000
But what does that mean?

102
0:06:09.086,000 --> 0:06:1,000
That means that as astrophysicists,

103
0:06:10.792,000 --> 0:06:14,000
we have to rely on sophisticated computer simulations

104
0:06:15.176,000 --> 0:06:18,000
in order to understand these complex phenomena.

105
0:06:20.358,000 --> 0:06:23,000
These simulations can be used to really understand how gas behaves

106
0:06:24.178,000 --> 0:06:25,000
under such extreme conditions.

107
0:06:27.168,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And can be used to answer fundamental questions

108
0:06:29.445,000 --> 0:06:32,000
like, "What ultimately disrupted the massive star?"

109
0:06:32.644,000 --> 0:06:36,000
"How is it that this implosion can be reversed into an explosion?"

110
0:06:39.58,000 --> 0:06:41,000
There's a huge amount of debate in the field,

111
0:06:42.072,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but we all agree that neutrinos,

112
0:06:46.53,000 --> 0:06:48,000
which are these elusive elementary particles,

113
0:06:49.362,000 --> 0:06:5,000
play a crucial role.

114
0:06:51.873,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Yeah?

115
0:06:53.062,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I'm about to show you one of those simulations.

116
0:06:58.509,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So neutrinos are produced in huge numbers once the core collapses.

117
0:07:04.183,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And in fact,

118
0:07:05.378,000 --> 0:07:08,000
they are responsible for transferring the energy in this core.

119
0:07:09.696,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Like thermal radiation in a heater,

120
0:07:12.331,000 --> 0:07:15,000
neutrinos pump energy into the core,

121
0:07:15.903,000 --> 0:07:19,000
increasing the possibility of disrupting the star.

122
0:07:20.784,000 --> 0:07:22,000
In fact, for about a fraction of a second,

123
0:07:23.569,000 --> 0:07:24,000
neutrinos pump so much energy

124
0:07:25.22,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that the pressure increases high enough that a shock wave is produced

125
0:07:29.924,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and the shock wave goes and disrupts the entire star.

126
0:07:34.006,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And it is in that shock wave where elements are produced.

127
0:07:40.243,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So thank you, neutrinos.

128
0:07:41.982,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Laughter)

129
0:07:45.132,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Supernovas shine bright,

130
0:07:48.243,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and for a brief period of time,

131
0:07:50.458,000 --> 0:07:55,000
they radiate more energy than the sun will in its entire lifetime.

132
0:07:56.852,000 --> 0:07:58,000
That point of light that you see there,

133
0:07:59.583,000 --> 0:08:02,000
which was certainly not there before,

134
0:08:02.908,000 --> 0:08:04,000
burns like a beacon,

135
0:08:05.218,000 --> 0:08:08,000
clearly indicating the position where the massive star has died.

136
0:08:11.196,000 --> 0:08:13,000
In a galaxy like our own Milky Way,

137
0:08:13.871,000 --> 0:08:16,000
we estimate that about once every 50 years,

138
0:08:17.807,000 --> 0:08:18,000
a massive star dies.

139
0:08:20.696,000 --> 0:08:23,000
This implies that somewhere in the universe,

140
0:08:23.721,000 --> 0:08:26,000
there's a supernova explosion every second or so.

141
0:08:29.46,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And thankfully for astronomers,

142
0:08:31.746,000 --> 0:08:34,000
some of them are actually found relatively close to earth.

143
0:08:36.363,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Various civilizations recorded these supernova explosions

144
0:08:42.046,000 --> 0:08:44,000
long before the telescope was invented.

145
0:08:46.699,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The most famous of all of them

146
0:08:48.92,000 --> 0:08:51,000
is probably the supernova explosion that gave rise to the Crab Nebula.

147
0:08:53.746,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Yeah?

148
0:08:55.038,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Korean and Chinese astronomers recorded this supernova in 1054,

149
0:09:01.117,000 --> 0:09:03,000
as did, almost certainly, Native Americans.

150
0:09:05.372,000 --> 0:09:1,000
This supernova happened about 5,600 light-years away from earth.

151
0:09:11.205,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And it was so incredibly bright

152
0:09:13.427,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that astronomers could see it during the day.

153
0:09:16.651,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And it was visible to the naked eye for about two years in the night sky.

154
0:09:25.278,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Fast forward 1,000 years or so later, and what do we see?

155
0:09:30.062,000 --> 0:09:34,000
We see these filaments that were blasted by the explosion,

156
0:09:34.197,000 --> 0:09:36,000
moving at 300 miles per second.

157
0:09:37.133,000 --> 0:09:41,000
These filaments are essential for us to understand

158
0:09:41.331,000 --> 0:09:42,000
how massive stars die.

159
0:09:43.752,000 --> 0:09:44,000
The image that you see there

160
0:09:45.141,000 --> 0:09:47,000
was assembled by the Hubble Space Telescope

161
0:09:47.609,000 --> 0:09:48,000
over a span of three months.

162
0:09:49.99,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And it is incredibly important to astronomers

163
0:09:52.286,000 --> 0:09:55,000
because it ultimately carries the chemical legacy

164
0:09:55.498,000 --> 0:09:56,000
of the star that exploded.

165
0:09:57.76,000 --> 0:10:02,000
The orange filaments that you see there are the tattered remains of the star,

166
0:10:02.857,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and are made primarily of hydrogen,

167
0:10:05.634,000 --> 0:10:08,000
while the blue and red filaments that you see

168
0:10:08.841,000 --> 0:10:1,000
are the freshly synthesized oxygen.

169
0:10:11.746,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So studying supernova remnants, like the Crab Nebula,

170
0:10:16.214,000 --> 0:10:18,000
allowed astronomers to firmly conclude

171
0:10:18.532,000 --> 0:10:23,000
that the vast majority of oxygen on earth was produced by supernova explosions

172
0:10:23.999,000 --> 0:10:25,000
over the history of the universe.

173
0:10:27.117,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And we can estimate

174
0:10:28.657,000 --> 0:10:32,000
that in order to assemble all the atoms of oxygen in our body,

175
0:10:33.124,000 --> 0:10:36,000
it took on the order of a 100 million supernova.

176
0:10:37.151,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So every bit of you, or at least the majority of it,

177
0:10:41.167,000 --> 0:10:43,000
came from one of these supernova explosions.

178
0:10:47.268,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So now you may be wondering,

179
0:10:48.887,000 --> 0:10:5,000
how is it that these atoms

180
0:10:50.911,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that were generated in such extreme conditions

181
0:10:55.688,000 --> 0:10:57,000
ultimately took residence in our body?

182
0:10:59.212,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So I want you to follow the thought experiment.

183
0:11:03.105,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Imagine that we're in the Milky Way, and a supernova happens.

184
0:11:06.998,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It blasted tons and tons of oxygen atoms

185
0:11:10.919,000 --> 0:11:12,000
almost into empty space.

186
0:11:14.085,000 --> 0:11:18,000
A few of them were able to be assembled in a cloud.

187
0:11:19.292,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Now, 4.5 billion years ago,

188
0:11:22.601,000 --> 0:11:25,000
something unsettled that cloud and caused it to collapse,

189
0:11:26.093,000 --> 0:11:3,000
forming the sun in its center and the solar system.

190
0:11:32.216,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So the sun, the planets and life on earth

191
0:11:35.843,000 --> 0:11:37,000
depend on this beautiful cycle

192
0:11:38.431,000 --> 0:11:42,000
of stellar birth, stellar death and stellar rebirth.

193
0:11:43.875,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And this continues the recycling of atoms in the universe.

194
0:11:48.629,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And as a result, astronomy and chemistry are intimately connected.

195
0:11:53.815,000 --> 0:11:59,000
We are life forms that have evolved to inhale the waste products of plants.

196
0:12:01.292,000 --> 0:12:02,000
But now you know

197
0:12:02.546,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that we also inhale the waste products of supernova explosions.

198
0:12:05.744,000 --> 0:12:06,000
(Laughter)

199
0:12:08.99,000 --> 0:12:1,000
So take a moment, inhale.

200
0:12:12.228,000 --> 0:12:14,000
An oxygen atom has just gone into your body.

201
0:12:15.211,000 --> 0:12:17,000
It is certain that that oxygen [atom]

202
0:12:17.562,000 --> 0:12:19,000
remembers that it was in the interior of a star

203
0:12:19.823,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and it was probably manufactured by a supernova explosion.

204
0:12:24.22,000 --> 0:12:28,000
This atom may have traveled the entire solar system

205
0:12:28.244,000 --> 0:12:3,000
until it splashed on earth,

206
0:12:30.522,000 --> 0:12:31,000
long before reaching you.

207
0:12:34.442,000 --> 0:12:35,000
When we breathe,

208
0:12:36.982,000 --> 0:12:4,000
we use hundreds of liters of oxygen every day.

209
0:12:43.566,000 --> 0:12:48,000
So I'm incredibly lucky to be standing in front of this beautiful audience,

210
0:12:48.614,000 --> 0:12:51,000
but I'm actually stealing your oxygen atoms.

211
0:12:51.876,000 --> 0:12:53,000
(Laughter)

212
0:12:54.429,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And because I'm speaking to you,

213
0:12:55.985,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I'm giving you some of them back, that once resided in me.

214
0:13:03.276,000 --> 0:13:07,000
So breathing, yeah,

215
0:13:08.036,000 --> 0:13:12,000
participates in this beautiful exchange of atoms.

216
0:13:12.149,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And you can then ask,

217
0:13:15.887,000 --> 0:13:22,000
"Well, how many atoms in our body once belonged to Frida Kahlo?"

218
0:13:23.013,000 --> 0:13:25,000
(Laughter)

219
0:13:25.427,000 --> 0:13:26,000
About 100,000 of them.

220
0:13:28.339,000 --> 0:13:32,000
100,000 more probably belonged to Marie Curie,

221
0:13:32.792,000 --> 0:13:34,000
100,000 more to Sally Ride,

222
0:13:35.204,000 --> 0:13:37,000
or whoever you want to think of.

223
0:13:39.236,000 --> 0:13:45,000
So breathing is not only filling our lungs with cosmic history,

224
0:13:46.51,000 --> 0:13:47,000
but with human history.

225
0:13:49.696,000 --> 0:13:51,000
I would like to end my talk by sharing a myth

226
0:13:52.699,000 --> 0:13:53,000
that is very close to my heart.

227
0:13:54.524,000 --> 0:13:56,000
A myth from the Chichimeca culture,

228
0:13:56.913,000 --> 0:13:59,000
which is a very powerful Mesoamerican culture.

229
0:14:01.001,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And the Chichimecas believe

230
0:14:03.225,000 --> 0:14:06,000
that our essence was assembled in the heavens.

231
0:14:06.649,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And on its journey towards us,

232
0:14:08.839,000 --> 0:14:11,000
it actually fragmented into tons of different pieces.

233
0:14:13.445,000 --> 0:14:14,000
So my abuelo used to say,

234
0:14:15.032,000 --> 0:14:17,000
"One of the reasons you feel incomplete

235
0:14:17.778,000 --> 0:14:19,000
is because you are missing your pieces."

236
0:14:20.023,000 --> 0:14:21,000
(Laughter)

237
0:14:21.066,000 --> 0:14:22,000
"But don't be fooled by that.

238
0:14:22.665,000 --> 0:14:25,000
You've been given an incredible opportunity of growth.

239
0:14:26.434,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Why?

240
0:14:27.609,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Because it's not like those pieces were scattered on earth

241
0:14:30.387,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and you have to go and pick them up.

242
0:14:32.173,000 --> 0:14:34,000
No, those pieces fell into other people.

243
0:14:35.489,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And only by sharing them you will become more complete.

244
0:14:40.021,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Yes, during your life,

245
0:14:41.212,000 --> 0:14:43,000
there's going to be individuals that have these huge pieces

246
0:14:44.058,000 --> 0:14:45,000
that make you feel whole.

247
0:14:47.355,000 --> 0:14:49,000
But in your quest of being complete,

248
0:14:50.284,000 --> 0:14:55,000
you have to treasure and share every single one of those pieces."

249
0:14:57.391,000 --> 0:15:,000
Sounds a lot like the story of oxygen to me.

250
0:15:00.505,000 --> 0:15:01,000
(Laughter)

251
0:15:01.574,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Which started in the heavens in a supernova explosion,

252
0:15:04.852,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and continues today,

253
0:15:08.061,000 --> 0:15:1,000
within the confines of our humanity.

254
0:15:11.911,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Our atoms in our body have embarked on an epic odyssey,

255
0:15:17.196,000 --> 0:15:22,000
with time spans from billions of years to mere centuries,

256
0:15:22.339,000 --> 0:15:24,000
all leading to you,

257
0:15:24.752,000 --> 0:15:25,000
all of you,

258
0:15:26.468,000 --> 0:15:27,000
witnesses of the universe.

259
0:15:28.365,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Thank you.

260
0:15:29.548,000 --> 0:15:32,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm going to show you how terrorism

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
actually interacts with our daily life.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
15 years ago I received a phone call from a friend.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
At the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
in Italian jails.

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
He asked me if I wanted to interview the Red Brigades.

7
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Now, as many of you may remember,

8
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
the Red Brigades was a terrorist, Marxist organization

9
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
which was very active in Italy

10
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
from the 1960s until the mid-1980s.

11
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
As part of their strategy

12
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the Red Brigades never spoke with anybody, not even with their lawyers.

13
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
They sat in silence through their trails,

14
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
waving occasionally at family and friends.

15
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
In 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle.

16
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And they drew a list of people with whom they would talk,

17
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and tell their story.

18
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And I was one of those people.

19
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
When I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me,

20
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
he said that the female members of the organization

21
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
had actually supported my name.

22
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
In particular, one person had put it forward.

23
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
She was my childhood friend.

24
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
She had joined the Red Brigades

25
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and became a leader of the organization.

26
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Naturally, I didn't know that

27
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
until the day she was arrested.

28
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
In fact, I read it in the newspaper.

29
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
At the time of the phone call

30
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I just had a baby,

31
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I successfully completed a management buyout

32
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to the company I was working with,

33
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home

34
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and touring the high-security prisons.

35
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But this is exactly what I did

36
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
because I wanted to know

37
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
what had turned my best friend

38
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
into a terrorist,

39
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and why she'd never tried to recruit me.

40
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
(Applause)

42
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So, this is exactly what I did.

43
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Now, I found the answer very quickly.

44
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I actually had failed

45
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the psychological profiling of a terrorist.

46
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
The center committee of the Red Brigades

47
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
had judged me too single-minded

48
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and too opinionated to become a good terrorist.

49
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
My friend, on the other hand, she was a good terrorist

50
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
because she was very good at following orders.

51
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
She also embraced violence.

52
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Because she believed that the only way

53
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to unblock what, at the time,

54
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
was known as a blocked democracy,

55
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Italy, a country run by the same party for 35 years

56
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
was the arms struggle.

57
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
At the same time, while I was interviewing the Red Brigades,

58
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I also discovered that their life was not ruled

59
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
by politics or ideology,

60
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
but actually was ruled by economics.

61
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
They were constantly short of cash.

62
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
They were constantly searching for cash.

63
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Now, contrary to what many people believe,

64
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
terrorism is actually a very expensive business.

65
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I'll give you an idea.

66
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
In the 1970s, the turnover of the Red Brigades

67
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
on a yearly basis

68
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
was seven million dollars.

69
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
This is roughly between 100

70
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and 150 million, today.

71
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Now, you know, if you live underground

72
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
it's really hard to produce this amount of money.

73
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But this also explains why, when I was interviewing the Red Brigades,

74
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and then, later on, other arms organizations,

75
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
including members of al-Zarqawi group in the Middle East,

76
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
everybody was extremely reluctant

77
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to talk about ideology, or politics.

78
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Because they had no idea.

79
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
The political vision of a terrorist organization

80
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
is decided by the leadership,

81
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
which, generally, is never more than five to seven people.

82
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
All the others do, day in and day out,

83
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
is search for money.

84
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Once, for example, I was interviewing

85
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
this part-timer from the Red Brigades.

86
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It was a psychiatrist. He loved sailing.

87
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
He was a really keen sailor. And he had this beautiful boat.

88
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And he told me that the best time of his life

89
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
was when he was a member of the Red Brigades

90
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and he went sailing, every summer, back and forth

91
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
from Lebanon, where he would pick up

92
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Soviet weapons from the PLO,

93
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and then carry them all the way to Sardinia

94
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
where the other arms organization from Europe would go

95
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and take their share of the arms.

96
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
For that service the Red Brigades were actually paid a fee,

97
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
which went to fund their organization.

98
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So, because I am a trained economist

99
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and I think in economic terms,

100
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
all of the sudden I thought,

101
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
maybe there is something here.

102
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Maybe there is a link, a commercial link,

103
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
between one organization and another one.

104
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But it was only when I interviewed

105
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Mario Moretti, the head of the Red Brigades,

106
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the man who kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro,

107
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Italian former prime minister,

108
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that I finally realized

109
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that terrorism is actually business.

110
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I was having lunch with him

111
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
in a high-security prison in Italy.

112
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And as we were eating,

113
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I had the distinct feeling

114
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that I was back in the city of London,

115
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist.

116
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
This guy thought in the same way I did.

117
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So, I decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism.

118
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Naturally, nobody wanted to fund my research.

119
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
In fact, I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy.

120
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
You know, that woman that goes around to foundations

121
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
asking for money, thinking about the economics of terrorism.

122
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So, in the end, I took a decision

123
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that, in retrospect, did change my life.

124
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I sold my company,

125
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and funded the research myself.

126
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And what I discovered

127
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
is this parallel reality,

128
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
another international economic system,

129
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
which runs parallel to our own,

130
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
which has been created by arms organizations

131
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
since the end of World War II.

132
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And what is even more shocking

133
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
is that this system

134
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
has followed, step by step, the evolution

135
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
of our own system,

136
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
of our Western capitalism.

137
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And there are three main stages.

138
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The first one is the state sponsor of terrorism.

139
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
The second one is the privatization of terrorism.

140
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And the third, of course, is the globalization of terrorism.

141
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So, state sponsor of terrorism,

142
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
feature of the Cold War.

143
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
This is when the two superpowers were fighting

144
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
a war by proxy,

145
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
along the periphery of the sphere of influence,

146
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
fully funding arms organizations.

147
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
A mix of legal and illegal activities is used.

148
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So, the link between crime and terror

149
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is established very early on.

150
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And here is the best example,

151
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the Contras in Nicaragua, created by the CIA,

152
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
legally funded by the U.S. Congress,

153
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
illegally funded by the Reagan administration

154
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
via covert operation, for example, the Iran-Contra Affair.

155
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Then comes the late 1970s, early '80s,

156
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and some groups successfully carry out

157
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
the privatization of terrorism.

158
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So, they gain independence from the sponsor,

159
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and start funding themselves.

160
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Now, again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities.

161
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So, Arafat used to get a percentage

162
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
of the smuggling of hashish

163
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
from Bekáa Valley, which is the valley between Lebanon and Syria.

164
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And the IRA, which control the private transportation system

165
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in Northern Ireland, did exactly the same thing.

166
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So, every single time

167
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that somebody got into a taxi in Belfast

168
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
without knowing, actually,

169
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
was funding the IRA.

170
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But the great change came, of course,

171
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
with globalization and deregulation.

172
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
This is when arms organization were able to link up,

173
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
also financially, with each other.

174
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
But above all, they started to do

175
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
serious business with the world of crime.

176
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And together they money-laundered

177
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
their dirty business through the same channel.

178
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
This is when we see the birth of the transnational

179
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
arms organization Al Qaeda.

180
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
This is an organization that can raise money across border.

181
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
But also that is able to carry out attacks

182
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
in more than one country.

183
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Now, deregulation also brought back

184
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
rogue economics.

185
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So what is rogue economics?

186
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Rogue economics is a force which is constantly

187
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
lurking in the background of history.

188
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It comes back at times of great transformation,

189
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
globalization being one of those transformations.

190
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
It is at this times in which

191
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
politics actually loses control of the economy,

192
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and the economy becomes a rogue force

193
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
working against us.

194
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
It has happened before in history.

195
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
It has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire.

196
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
It has happened with Industrial Revolution.

197
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And it actually happened again, with the fall of the Berlin wall.

198
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Now, I calculated how big was this international

199
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
economic system composed by crime,

200
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
terror, and illegal economy,

201
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
before 9-11.

202
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And it is a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars.

203
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
It is trillions, it's not billions.

204
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
This is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom,

205
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
soon will be more,

206
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
considering where this country is going.

207
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Laughter)

208
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Now, until 9-11,

209
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
the bulk of all this money

210
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
flew into the U.S. economy

211
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
because the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars

212
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and the money laundering was taking place

213
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
inside the United States.

214
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
The entry point, of course, of most of this money

215
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
were the off-shore facilities.

216
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So, this was a vital injection of cash

217
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
into the U.S. economy.

218
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Now, when I went to look at the figures of the U.S. money supply,

219
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
the U.S. money supply is the amount

220
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
of dollars that the Federal Reserve

221
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
prints every year

222
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
in order to satisfy

223
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
the increase in the demand for dollars,

224
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
which, of course, reflects the growth

225
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
of the economy.

226
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So, when I went to look at those figures, I noted that since the late 1960s

227
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
a growing number of these dollars

228
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
was actually leaving the United States,

229
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
never to come back.

230
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
These were money taken out

231
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
in suitcases or in containers, in cash of course.

232
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
These were money taken out by criminals and money launderers.

233
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
These were money taken out to fund

234
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
the growth of the terror,

235
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
illegal and criminal economy.

236
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
So, you see, what is the relationship?

237
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
The United States actually is a country

238
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that is the reserve currency of the world.

239
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
What does it mean? That means that

240
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
it has a privilege that other countries do not have.

241
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
It can borrow against the total amount of dollars

242
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
in circulation in the world.

243
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
This privilege is called seigniorage.

244
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
No other country can do that.

245
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
All the other countries, for example the United Kingdom,

246
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
can borrow only against the amount of money

247
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
in circulation inside its own borders.

248
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So, here is the implication of the relationship

249
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
between the worlds of crime, terror, and illegal economy, and our economy.

250
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
The U.S. in the 1990s

251
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
was borrowing against the growth

252
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
of the terror, illegal and criminal economy.

253
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
This is how close we are with this world.

254
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Now, this situation changed, of course, after 9-11,

255
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
because George Bush launched the War on Terror.

256
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Part of the War on Terror

257
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
was the introduction of the Patriot Act.

258
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Now, many of you know that the Patriot Act

259
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
is a legislation that greatly reduces

260
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
the liberties of Americans in order to protect them

261
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
against terrorism.

262
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
But there is a section of the Patriot Act

263
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
which refers specifically to finance.

264
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And it is, in fact, an anti-money-laundering legislation.

265
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
What the Patriot Act did was

266
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
to prohibit U.S. bank,

267
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and U.S.-registered foreign banks

268
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities.

269
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
It closed that door between the money laundering

270
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
in dollars, and the U.S. economy.

271
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
It also gave the U.S. monetary authorities

272
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
the right to monitor any dollar transaction

273
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
taking place anywhere in the world.

274
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Now, you can imagine what was the reaction of the international

275
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
finance and banking.

276
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
All the bankers said to their clients,

277
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
"Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else."

278
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Now, the Euro was a newly born currency

279
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
of great opportunity for business, and, of course, for investment.

280
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And this is what people did.

281
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Nobody wants the U.S. monetary authority

282
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
to check their relationship,

283
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
to monitor their relationship with their clientele.

284
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
The same thing happened, of course,

285
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
in the world of crime and terror.

286
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
People simply moved their money-laundering activities

287
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
away from the United States

288
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
into Europe.

289
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Why did this happen? This happened because

290
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
the Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation.

291
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
It was introduced only in the United States.

292
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars.

293
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
In Europe, a similar legislation

294
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
was not introduced.

295
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So, within six months

296
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Europe became the epicenter

297
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
of the money-laundering activities

298
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
of the world.

299
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
So, this is how incredible are the relationship

300
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
between the world of crime

301
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and the world of terror,

302
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and our own life.

303
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
So, why did I tell you this story?

304
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
I told you this story because you

305
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
must understand that there is a world

306
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers,

307
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
including the personal relationship that you have

308
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
with friends and family.

309
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
You got to question everything that is told to you,

310
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
including what I just told you today.

311
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
(Laughter)

312
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
This is the only way for you

313
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
to step into the dark side, and have a look at it.

314
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And believe me,

315
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
it's going to be scary.

316
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
It's going to be frightful, but it's going to enlighten you.

317
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And, above all, it's not going to be boring.

318
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
(Laughter)

319
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
(Applause)

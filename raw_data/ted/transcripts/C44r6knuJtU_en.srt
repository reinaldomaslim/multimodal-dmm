1
0:00:12.866,000 --> 0:00:13,000
As a little Hawaiian,

2
0:00:14.095,000 --> 0:00:17,000
my mom and auntie always told me stories about Kalaupapa --

3
0:00:17.501,000 --> 0:00:18,000
the Hawaiian leper colony

4
0:00:18.846,000 --> 0:00:2,000
surrounded by the highest sea cliffs in the world --

5
0:00:21.697,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and Father Damien,

6
0:00:23.133,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the Belgian missionary who gave his life for the Hawaiian community.

7
0:00:27.102,000 --> 0:00:28,000
As a young nurse,

8
0:00:28.489,000 --> 0:00:3,000
my aunt trained the nuns caring for the remaining lepers

9
0:00:31.454,000 --> 0:00:34,000
almost a 100 years after Father Damien died of leprosy.

10
0:00:36.501,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I remember stories she told

11
0:00:38.196,000 --> 0:00:4,000
about traveling down switchback cliff paths on a mule,

12
0:00:41.172,000 --> 0:00:44,000
while my uncle played her favorite hula songs on the ukulele

13
0:00:44.327,000 --> 0:00:45,000
all the way down to Kalaupapa.

14
0:00:46.73,000 --> 0:00:47,000
You see, as a youngster,

15
0:00:48.255,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I was always curious about a few things.

16
0:00:50.681,000 --> 0:00:55,000
First was why a Belgian missionary chose to live in complete isolation

17
0:00:55.755,000 --> 0:00:56,000
in Kalaupapa,

18
0:00:56.969,000 --> 0:00:58,000
knowing he would inevitably contract leprosy

19
0:00:59.223,000 --> 0:01:01,000
from the community of people he sought to help.

20
0:01:02.256,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And secondly,

21
0:01:04.617,000 --> 0:01:06,000
where did the leprosy bacteria come from?

22
0:01:07.002,000 --> 0:01:08,000

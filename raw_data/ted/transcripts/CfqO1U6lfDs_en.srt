1
0:00:12.645,000 --> 0:00:14,000
A herd of wildebeests, a shoal of fish,

2
0:00:15.196,000 --> 0:00:16,000
a flock of birds.

3
0:00:16.825,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Many animals gather in large groups

4
0:00:18.893,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that are among the most wonderful spectacles

5
0:00:20.879,000 --> 0:00:21,000
in the natural world.

6
0:00:22.597,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But why do these groups form?

7
0:00:25.321,000 --> 0:00:26,000
The common answers include things like

8
0:00:26.958,000 --> 0:00:28,000
seeking safety in numbers or hunting in packs

9
0:00:29.924,000 --> 0:00:31,000
or gathering to mate or breed,

10
0:00:32.42,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and all of these explanations,

11
0:00:34.088,000 --> 0:00:35,000
while often true,

12
0:00:35.325,000 --> 0:00:38,000
make a huge assumption about animal behavior,

13
0:00:38.368,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that the animals are in control of their own actions,

14
0:00:41.545,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that they are in charge of their bodies.

15
0:00:43.796,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And that is often not the case.

16
0:00:47.223,000 --> 0:00:49,000
This is Artemia, a brine shrimp.

17
0:00:50.147,000 --> 0:00:52,000
You probably know it better as a sea monkey.

18
0:00:52.911,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It's small, and it typically lives alone,

19
0:00:54.906,000 --> 0:00:57,000
but it can gather in these large red swarms

20
0:00:57.983,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that span for meters,

21
0:01:00.23,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and these form because of a parasite.

22
0:01:03.32,000 --> 0:01:05,000
These shrimp are infected with a tapeworm.

23
0:01:06.006,000 --> 0:01:08,000
A tapeworm is effectively a long, living gut

24
0:01:08.257,000 --> 0:01:1,000
with genitals at one end and a hooked mouth at the other.

25
0:01:11.145,000 --> 0:01:13,000
As a freelance journalist, I sympathize.

26
0:01:13.68,000 --> 0:01:15,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:15.835,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The tapeworm drains nutrients from Artemia's body,

28
0:01:18.743,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but it also does other things.

29
0:01:20.82,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It castrates them,

30
0:01:22.44,000 --> 0:01:26,000
it changes their color from transparent to bright red,

31
0:01:27.158,000 --> 0:01:28,000
it makes them live longer,

32
0:01:28.674,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and as biologist Nicolas Rode has found,

33
0:01:31.031,000 --> 0:01:34,000
it makes them swim in groups.

34
0:01:34.39,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Why? Because the tapeworm, like many other parasites,

35
0:01:37.842,000 --> 0:01:38,000
has a complicated life cycle

36
0:01:39.423,000 --> 0:01:41,000
involving many different hosts.

37
0:01:41.687,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The shrimp are just one step on its journey.

38
0:01:44.091,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Its ultimate destination is this,

39
0:01:46.703,000 --> 0:01:47,000
the greater flamingo.

40
0:01:48.65,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Only in a flamingo can the tapeworm reproduce,

41
0:01:51.675,000 --> 0:01:54,000
so to get there, it manipulates its shrimp hosts

42
0:01:54.964,000 --> 0:01:57,000
into forming these conspicuous colored swarms

43
0:01:58.055,000 --> 0:02:,000
that are easier for a flamingo to spot

44
0:02:00.772,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and to devour,

45
0:02:02.331,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and that is the secret of the Artemia swarm.

46
0:02:05.263,000 --> 0:02:07,000
They aren't sociable through their own volition,

47
0:02:07.426,000 --> 0:02:09,000
but because they are being controlled.

48
0:02:09.502,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It's not safety in numbers.

49
0:02:11.196,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It's actually the exact opposite.

50
0:02:13.055,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The tapeworm hijacks their brains and their bodies,

51
0:02:16.096,000 --> 0:02:17,000
turning them into vehicles

52
0:02:17.492,000 --> 0:02:2,000
for getting itself into a flamingo.

53
0:02:21.459,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And here is another example

54
0:02:22.889,000 --> 0:02:24,000
of a parasitic manipulation.

55
0:02:25.415,000 --> 0:02:27,000
This is a suicidal cricket.

56
0:02:28.391,000 --> 0:02:31,000
This cricket swallowed the larvae of a Gordian worm,

57
0:02:31.695,000 --> 0:02:32,000
or horsehair worm.

58
0:02:33.588,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The worm grew to adult size within it,

59
0:02:35.744,000 --> 0:02:38,000
but it needs to get into water in order to mate,

60
0:02:38.782,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and it does that by releasing proteins

61
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that addle the cricket's brain,

62
0:02:43.188,000 --> 0:02:45,000
causing it to behave erratically.

63
0:02:45.352,000 --> 0:02:46,000
When the cricket nears a body of water,

64
0:02:47.307,000 --> 0:02:48,000
such as this swimming pool,

65
0:02:48.926,000 --> 0:02:5,000
it jumps in and drowns,

66
0:02:51.183,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and the worm wriggles out

67
0:02:52.908,000 --> 0:02:55,000
of its suicidal corpse.

68
0:02:56.764,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Crickets are really roomy. Who knew?

69
0:03:00.367,000 --> 0:03:03,000
The tapeworm and the Gordian worm are not alone.

70
0:03:03.582,000 --> 0:03:04,000
They are part of an entire cavalcade

71
0:03:05.302,000 --> 0:03:07,000
of mind-controlling parasites,

72
0:03:07.379,000 --> 0:03:1,000
of fungi, viruses, and worms and insects and more

73
0:03:11.328,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that all specialize in subverting and overriding

74
0:03:13.901,000 --> 0:03:15,000
the wills of their hosts.

75
0:03:16.11,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Now, I first learned about this way of life

76
0:03:17.847,000 --> 0:03:19,000
through David Attenborough's "Trials of Life"

77
0:03:20.34,000 --> 0:03:21,000
about 20 years ago,

78
0:03:22.062,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and then later through a wonderful book called

79
0:03:23.764,000 --> 0:03:25,000
"Parasite Rex" by my friend Carl Zimmer.

80
0:03:26.438,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And I've been writing about these creatures ever since.

81
0:03:28.581,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Few topics in biology enthrall me more.

82
0:03:31.392,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It's like the parasites have subverted my own brain.

83
0:03:35.098,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Because after all, they are always compelling

84
0:03:37.709,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and they are delightfully macabre.

85
0:03:38.997,000 --> 0:03:39,000
When you write about parasites,

86
0:03:40.389,000 --> 0:03:42,000
your lexicon swells with phrases like

87
0:03:42.473,000 --> 0:03:45,000
"devoured alive" and "bursts out of its body."

88
0:03:45.519,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Laughter)

89
0:03:46.756,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But there's more to it than that.

90
0:03:48.296,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I'm a writer, and fellow writers in the audience

91
0:03:50.398,000 --> 0:03:52,000
will know that we love stories.

92
0:03:53.107,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Parasites invite us to resist the allure

93
0:03:55.5,000 --> 0:03:56,000
of obvious stories.

94
0:03:57.35,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Their world is one of plot twists

95
0:03:59.66,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and unexpected explanations.

96
0:04:03.267,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Why, for example,

97
0:04:04.763,000 --> 0:04:06,000
does this caterpillar

98
0:04:06.941,000 --> 0:04:07,000
start violently thrashing about

99
0:04:08.915,000 --> 0:04:09,000
when another insect gets close to it

100
0:04:10.583,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and those white cocoons that it seems

101
0:04:12.84,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to be standing guard over?

102
0:04:14.278,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Is it maybe protecting its siblings?

103
0:04:17.374,000 --> 0:04:18,000
No.

104
0:04:18.823,000 --> 0:04:19,000
This caterpillar was attacked

105
0:04:20.28,000 --> 0:04:23,000
by a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it.

106
0:04:23.499,000 --> 0:04:24,000
The eggs hatched and the young wasps

107
0:04:24.933,000 --> 0:04:25,000
devoured the caterpillar alive

108
0:04:26.247,000 --> 0:04:27,000
before bursting out of its body.

109
0:04:27.918,000 --> 0:04:29,000
See what I mean?

110
0:04:30.193,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Now, the caterpillar didn't die.

111
0:04:33.031,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Some of the wasps seemed to stay behind

112
0:04:35.616,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and controlled it into defending their siblings

113
0:04:38.953,000 --> 0:04:39,000
which are metamorphosing

114
0:04:40.587,000 --> 0:04:42,000
into adults within those cocoons.

115
0:04:42.607,000 --> 0:04:45,000
This caterpillar is a head-banging zombie bodyguard

116
0:04:46.146,000 --> 0:04:47,000
defending the offspring

117
0:04:47.447,000 --> 0:04:49,000
of the creature that killed it.

118
0:04:49.669,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Applause)

119
0:04:53.535,000 --> 0:04:57,000
We have a lot to get through. I only have 13 minutes. (Laughter)

120
0:04:57.83,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Now, some of you are probably just

121
0:04:59.641,000 --> 0:05:01,000
desperately clawing for some solace

122
0:05:01.859,000 --> 0:05:03,000
in the idea that these things are oddities

123
0:05:04.119,000 --> 0:05:05,000
of the natural world, that they are outliers,

124
0:05:06.05,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and that point of view is understandable,

125
0:05:07.87,000 --> 0:05:09,000
because by their nature, parasites are quite small

126
0:05:10.248,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and they spend a lot of their time

127
0:05:11.588,000 --> 0:05:13,000
inside the bodies of other things.

128
0:05:14.542,000 --> 0:05:15,000
They're easy to overlook,

129
0:05:16.313,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but that doesn't mean that they aren't important.

130
0:05:18.898,000 --> 0:05:2,000
A few years back, a man called Kevin Lafferty

131
0:05:21.103,000 --> 0:05:24,000
took a group of scientists into three Californian estuaries

132
0:05:24.472,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and they pretty much weighed and dissected

133
0:05:26.22,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and recorded everything they could find,

134
0:05:28.215,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and what they found

135
0:05:29.443,000 --> 0:05:32,000
were parasites in extreme abundance.

136
0:05:32.659,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Especially common were trematodes,

137
0:05:34.703,000 --> 0:05:36,000
tiny worms that specialize in castrating their hosts

138
0:05:37.353,000 --> 0:05:39,000
like this unfortunate snail.

139
0:05:39.899,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Now, a single trematode is tiny, microscopic,

140
0:05:42.788,000 --> 0:05:43,000
but collectively they weighed as much

141
0:05:44.587,000 --> 0:05:46,000
as all the fish in the estuaries

142
0:05:46.773,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and three to nine times more than all the birds.

143
0:05:50.48,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And remember the Gordian worm that I showed you,

144
0:05:52.474,000 --> 0:05:53,000
the cricket thing?

145
0:05:53.862,000 --> 0:05:55,000
One Japanese scientist called Takuya Sato

146
0:05:56.415,000 --> 0:05:57,000
found that in one stream,

147
0:05:58.111,000 --> 0:05:59,000
these things drive so many crickets

148
0:06:00.082,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and grasshoppers into the water

149
0:06:01.381,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that the drowned insects

150
0:06:02.69,000 --> 0:06:06,000
make up some 60 percent of the diet of local trout.

151
0:06:06.994,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Manipulation is not an oddity.

152
0:06:09.928,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It is a critical and common part

153
0:06:12.048,000 --> 0:06:13,000
of the world around us,

154
0:06:13.939,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and scientists have now found

155
0:06:15.46,000 --> 0:06:17,000
hundreds of examples of such manipulators,

156
0:06:17.942,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and more excitingly, they're starting to understand

157
0:06:20.379,000 --> 0:06:24,000
exactly how these creatures control their hosts.

158
0:06:24.437,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And this is one of my favorite examples.

159
0:06:26.961,000 --> 0:06:28,000
This is Ampulex compressa,

160
0:06:29.418,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the emerald cockroach wasp,

161
0:06:31.642,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and it is a truth universally acknowledged

162
0:06:33.936,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that an emerald cockroach wasp in possession

163
0:06:35.579,000 --> 0:06:36,000
of some fertilized eggs

164
0:06:37.375,000 --> 0:06:39,000
must be in want of a cockroach.

165
0:06:39.841,000 --> 0:06:4,000
When she finds one,

166
0:06:41.041,000 --> 0:06:43,000
she stabs it with a stinger

167
0:06:43.252,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that is also a sense organ.

168
0:06:44.701,000 --> 0:06:46,000
This discovery came out three weeks ago.

169
0:06:47.372,000 --> 0:06:49,000
She stabs it with a stinger that is a sense organ

170
0:06:49.677,000 --> 0:06:5,000
equipped with small sensory bumps

171
0:06:51.471,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that allow her to feel the distinctive texture

172
0:06:54.026,000 --> 0:06:56,000
of a roach's brain.

173
0:06:56.133,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So like a person blindly rooting about in a bag,

174
0:06:59.174,000 --> 0:07:01,000
she finds the brain, and she injects it with venom

175
0:07:01.651,000 --> 0:07:05,000
into two very specific clusters of neurons.

176
0:07:05.852,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Israeli scientists Frederic Libersat and Ram Gal

177
0:07:08.935,000 --> 0:07:11,000
found that the venom is a very specific chemical weapon.

178
0:07:12.66,000 --> 0:07:14,000
It doesn't kill the roach, nor does it sedate it.

179
0:07:15.204,000 --> 0:07:17,000
The roach could walk away

180
0:07:17.331,000 --> 0:07:2,000
or fly or run if it chose to,

181
0:07:20.356,000 --> 0:07:21,000
but it doesn't choose to,

182
0:07:22.231,000 --> 0:07:25,000
because the venom nixes its motivation to walk,

183
0:07:25.611,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and only that.

184
0:07:26.725,000 --> 0:07:29,000
The wasp basically un-checks the escape-from-danger box

185
0:07:30.431,000 --> 0:07:31,000
in the roach's operating system,

186
0:07:32.271,000 --> 0:07:35,000
allowing her to lead her helpless victim

187
0:07:35.504,000 --> 0:07:37,000
back to her lair by its antennae

188
0:07:37.615,000 --> 0:07:39,000
like a person walking a dog.

189
0:07:40.254,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And once there, she lays an egg on it,

190
0:07:41.931,000 --> 0:07:43,000
egg hatches, devoured alive, bursts out of body,

191
0:07:44.207,000 --> 0:07:46,000
yadda yadda yadda, you know the drill.

192
0:07:46.396,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

193
0:07:49.626,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Now I would argue that, once stung,

194
0:07:52.506,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the cockroach isn't a roach anymore.

195
0:07:54.511,000 --> 0:07:56,000
It's more of an extension of the wasp,

196
0:07:56.861,000 --> 0:07:58,000
just like the cricket was an extension of the Gordian worm.

197
0:07:59.719,000 --> 0:08:01,000
These hosts won't get to survive or reproduce.

198
0:08:02.519,000 --> 0:08:03,000
They have as much control over their own fates

199
0:08:04.318,000 --> 0:08:05,000
as my car.

200
0:08:06.102,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Once the parasites get in,

201
0:08:07.602,000 --> 0:08:09,000
the hosts don't get a say.

202
0:08:10.167,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Now humans, of course,

203
0:08:11.481,000 --> 0:08:13,000
are no stranger to manipulation.

204
0:08:13.513,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We take drugs to shift the chemistries of our brains

205
0:08:15.873,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and to change our moods,

206
0:08:17.004,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and what are arguments or advertising or big ideas

207
0:08:21.024,000 --> 0:08:24,000
if not an attempt to influence someone else's mind?

208
0:08:24.727,000 --> 0:08:25,000
But our attempts at doing this

209
0:08:26.254,000 --> 0:08:27,000
are crude and blundering compared

210
0:08:28.032,000 --> 0:08:31,000
to the fine-grained specificity of the parasites.

211
0:08:31.127,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Don Draper only wishes he was as elegant

212
0:08:33.519,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and precise as the emerald cockroach wasp.

213
0:08:38.479,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Now, I think this is part of what makes parasites

214
0:08:42.219,000 --> 0:08:44,000
so sinister and so compelling.

215
0:08:45.005,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We place such a premium on our free will

216
0:08:47.627,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and our independence

217
0:08:48.888,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that the prospect of losing those qualities

218
0:08:50.469,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to forces unseen

219
0:08:51.747,000 --> 0:08:54,000
informs many of our deepest societal fears.

220
0:08:54.915,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Orwellian dystopias and shadowy cabals

221
0:08:57.368,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and mind-controlling supervillains --

222
0:08:59.222,000 --> 0:09:02,000
these are tropes that fill our darkest fiction,

223
0:09:02.25,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but in nature, they happen all the time.

224
0:09:07.048,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Which leads me to an obvious

225
0:09:09.68,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and disquieting question:

226
0:09:11.98,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Are there dark, sinister parasites

227
0:09:13.703,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that are influencing our behavior

228
0:09:15.659,000 --> 0:09:16,000
without us knowing about it,

229
0:09:17.234,000 --> 0:09:19,000
besides the NSA?

230
0:09:20.053,000 --> 0:09:21,000
If there are any —

231
0:09:21.36,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

232
0:09:25.326,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I've got a red dot on my forehead now, don't I?

233
0:09:27.648,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Laughter)

234
0:09:30.175,000 --> 0:09:32,000
If there are any, this is a good candidate for them.

235
0:09:33.129,000 --> 0:09:36,000
This is Toxoplasma gondii, or Toxo, for short,

236
0:09:36.407,000 --> 0:09:37,000
because the terrifying creature

237
0:09:37.996,000 --> 0:09:39,000
always deserves a cute nickname.

238
0:09:40.206,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Toxo infects mammals,

239
0:09:42.488,000 --> 0:09:43,000
a wide variety of mammals,

240
0:09:43.966,000 --> 0:09:46,000
but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat.

241
0:09:47.047,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And scientists like Joanne Webster have shown that

242
0:09:49.808,000 --> 0:09:51,000
if Toxo gets into a rat or a mouse,

243
0:09:52.001,000 --> 0:09:55,000
it turns the rodent into a cat-seeking missile.

244
0:09:55.473,000 --> 0:09:58,000
If the infected rat smells the delightful odor

245
0:09:58.549,000 --> 0:09:59,000
of cat piss,

246
0:09:59.773,000 --> 0:10:01,000
it runs towards the source of the smell

247
0:10:02.493,000 --> 0:10:05,000
rather than the more sensible direction of away.

248
0:10:06.412,000 --> 0:10:08,000
The cat eats the rat. Toxo gets to have sex.

249
0:10:08.947,000 --> 0:10:1,000
It's a classic tale of Eat, Prey, Love.

250
0:10:11.819,000 --> 0:10:15,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

251
0:10:19.512,000 --> 0:10:22,000
You're very charitable, generous people.

252
0:10:22.714,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Hi, Elizabeth, I loved your talk.

253
0:10:25.299,000 --> 0:10:28,000
How does the parasite control its host

254
0:10:28.667,000 --> 0:10:29,000
in this way?

255
0:10:29.871,000 --> 0:10:3,000
We don't really know.

256
0:10:31.197,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We know that Toxo releases an enzyme

257
0:10:32.885,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that makes dopamine, a substance involved

258
0:10:34.877,000 --> 0:10:35,000
in reward and motivation.

259
0:10:36.69,000 --> 0:10:38,000
We know it targets certain parts of a rodent's brain,

260
0:10:39.121,000 --> 0:10:41,000
including those involved in sexual arousal.

261
0:10:41.586,000 --> 0:10:43,000
But how those puzzle pieces fit together

262
0:10:43.787,000 --> 0:10:44,000
is not immediately clear.

263
0:10:45.631,000 --> 0:10:47,000
What is clear is that this thing

264
0:10:47.927,000 --> 0:10:48,000
is a single cell.

265
0:10:49.319,000 --> 0:10:5,000
This has no nervous system.

266
0:10:50.689,000 --> 0:10:51,000
It has no consciousness.

267
0:10:51.821,000 --> 0:10:52,000
It doesn't even have a body.

268
0:10:53.122,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But it's manipulating a mammal?

269
0:10:55.746,000 --> 0:10:56,000
We are mammals.

270
0:10:57.172,000 --> 0:10:59,000
We are more intelligent than a mere rat, to be sure,

271
0:10:59.606,000 --> 0:11:01,000
but our brains have the same basic structure,

272
0:11:02.13,000 --> 0:11:03,000
the same types of cells,

273
0:11:03.523,000 --> 0:11:04,000
the same chemicals running through them,

274
0:11:05.111,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and the same parasites.

275
0:11:07.43,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Estimates vary a lot, but some figures suggest

276
0:11:09.778,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that one in three people around the world

277
0:11:12.138,000 --> 0:11:13,000
have Toxo in their brains.

278
0:11:13.851,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Now typically, this doesn't lead to any overt illness.

279
0:11:17.339,000 --> 0:11:18,000
The parasite holds up in a dormant state

280
0:11:19.217,000 --> 0:11:21,000
for a long period of time.

281
0:11:21.4,000 --> 0:11:23,000
But there's some evidence that those people

282
0:11:23.439,000 --> 0:11:26,000
who are carriers score slightly differently

283
0:11:26.473,000 --> 0:11:28,000
on personality questionnaires than other people,

284
0:11:29.202,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that they have a slightly higher risk of car accidents,

285
0:11:31.686,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and there's some evidence that people with schizophrenia

286
0:11:34.289,000 --> 0:11:36,000
are more likely to be infected.

287
0:11:36.835,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Now, I think this evidence is still inconclusive,

288
0:11:39.018,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and even among Toxo researchers,

289
0:11:40.929,000 --> 0:11:42,000
opinion is divided as to whether the parasite

290
0:11:43.369,000 --> 0:11:45,000
is truly influencing our behavior.

291
0:11:45.754,000 --> 0:11:47,000
But given the widespread nature of such manipulations,

292
0:11:48.413,000 --> 0:11:49,000
it would be completely implausible

293
0:11:50.258,000 --> 0:11:51,000
for humans to be the only species

294
0:11:51.907,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that weren't similarly affected.

295
0:11:54.853,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And I think that this capacity to constantly

296
0:11:59.246,000 --> 0:12:01,000
subvert our way of thinking about the world

297
0:12:02.113,000 --> 0:12:03,000
makes parasites amazing.

298
0:12:03.66,000 --> 0:12:06,000
They're constantly inviting us to look at the natural world sideways,

299
0:12:06.869,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and to ask if the behaviors we're seeing,

300
0:12:09.04,000 --> 0:12:1,000
whether they're simple and obvious

301
0:12:10.527,000 --> 0:12:11,000
or baffling and puzzling,

302
0:12:12.06,000 --> 0:12:14,000
are not the results of individuals

303
0:12:14.146,000 --> 0:12:15,000
acting through their own accord

304
0:12:15.999,000 --> 0:12:16,000
but because they are being bent

305
0:12:17.808,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to the control of something else.

306
0:12:20.478,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And while that idea may be disquieting,

307
0:12:22.518,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and while parasites' habits may be very grisly,

308
0:12:25.441,000 --> 0:12:26,000
I think that ability to surprise us

309
0:12:27.233,000 --> 0:12:3,000
makes them as wonderful and as charismatic

310
0:12:30.408,000 --> 0:12:33,000
as any panda or butterfly or dolphin.

311
0:12:33.772,000 --> 0:12:35,000
At the end of "On the Origin of Species,"

312
0:12:35.991,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Charles Darwin writes about the grandeur of life,

313
0:12:38.98,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and of endless forms most beautiful

314
0:12:41.633,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and most wonderful,

315
0:12:43.065,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and I like to think he could easily have been talking

316
0:12:45.644,000 --> 0:12:48,000
about a tapeworm that makes shrimp sociable

317
0:12:48.824,000 --> 0:12:51,000
or a wasp that takes cockroaches for walks.

318
0:12:52.073,000 --> 0:12:55,000
But perhaps, that's just a parasite talking.

319
0:12:55.222,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Thank you.

320
0:12:56.953,000 --> 0:13:,000
(Applause)

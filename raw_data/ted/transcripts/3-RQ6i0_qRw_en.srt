1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I've actually been waiting by the phone

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:31,000
for a call from TED for years.

3
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And in fact, in 2000, I was ready to talk about eBay, but no call.

4
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:4,000
In 2003, I was ready to do a talk

5
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:44,000
about the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship. No call.

6
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
In 2004, I started Participant Productions

7
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and we had a really good first year, and no call.

8
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And finally, I get a call last year,

9
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams.

10
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:,000
(Laughter)

11
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:02,000
You've got a cruel sense of humor, TED.

12
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Laughter)

13
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:08,000
When I first moved to Hollywood from Silicon Valley,

14
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I had some misgivings.

15
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood.

16
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And, in fact, some advantages to owning your own media company.

18
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley

19
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:25,000
have a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.

20
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Hollywood has its sex symbols, and the Valley has its sex symbols.

21
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Hollywood has its rivalries, and the Valley has its rivalries.

23
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Hollywood gathers around power tables,

24
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and the Valley gathers around power tables.

25
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So it turned out there was a lot more in common

26
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:42,000
than I would have dreamed.

27
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But I'm actually here today to tell a story.

28
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And part of it is a personal story. When Chris invited me to speak,

29
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:53,000
he said, people think of you as a bit of an enigma,

30
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and they want to know what drives you a bit.

31
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And what really drives me is a vision of the future

32
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:,000
that I think we all share.

33
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability.

34
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And when we heard a lot of the presentations

35
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:1,000
over the last couple of days,

36
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Ed Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey,

37
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I think we all realized how far we have to go

38
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
to get to this new version of humanity

39
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that I like to call "Humanity 2.0."

40
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And it's also something that resides in each of us,

41
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to close what I think

42
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
are the two big calamities in the world today.

43
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:33,000
One is the gap in opportunity --

44
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
this gap that President Clinton last night

45
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
called uneven, unfair and unsustainable --

46
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and, out of that, comes poverty and illiteracy and disease

47
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and all these evils that we see around us.

48
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap.

49
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And someone, at some point, came up with this very bad idea

50
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world.

51
0:02:57,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And I think that's just a horrible thing.

52
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And so chapter one really begins today, with all of us,

53
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:06,000
because within each of us is the power to

54
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:1,000
equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps.

55
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And if the men and women of TED

56
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
can't make a difference in the world, I don't know who can.

57
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And for me, a lot of this started when I was younger

58
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and my family used to go camping in upstate New York.

59
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And there really wasn't much to do there for the summer,

60
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:27,000
except get beaten up by my sister or read books.

61
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And so I used to read authors like James Michener

62
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and James Clavell and Ayn Rand.

63
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And their stories made the world seem a very small

64
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and interconnected place.

65
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And it struck me that if I could write stories

66
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that were about this world as being small and interconnected,

67
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that maybe I could get people interested in the issues

68
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that affected us all, and maybe engage them to make a difference.

69
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I didn't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living,

70
0:03:57,000 --> 0:04:01,000
so I decided to go on a path to become financially independent,

71
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:03,000
so I could write these stories as quickly as I could.

72
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I then had a bit of a wake-up call when I was 14.

73
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And my dad came home one day

74
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and announced that he had cancer, and it looked pretty bad.

75
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And what he said was, he wasn't so much afraid that he might die,

76
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:22,000
but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life.

77
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And knock on wood, he's still alive today, many years later.

78
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:3,000
But for a young man that made a real impression on me,

79
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that one never knows how much time one really has.

80
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering.

81
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I started a couple of businesses

82
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom.

83
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:46,000
One of those businesses was a computer rental business

84
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:47,000
called Micros on the Move,

85
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:48,000
which is very well named,

86
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:5,000
because people kept stealing the computers.

87
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:51,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business,

89
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:57,000
so I went to Stanford Business School and studied there.

90
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And while I was there, I made friends with a fellow

91
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:04,000
named Pierre Omidyar, who is here today. And Pierre, I apologize

92
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
for this. This is a photo from the old days.

93
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And just after I'd graduated, Pierre came to me

94
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:11,000
with this idea to help people

95
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:12,000
buy and sell things online with each other.

96
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And with the wisdom of my Stanford degree,

97
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I said, "Pierre, what a stupid idea."

98
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Laughter)

99
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And needless to say, I was right.

100
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Laughter)

101
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But right after that, Pierre -- in '96, Pierre and I left our full-time jobs

102
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story, you know.

103
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:31,000
The company went public two years later

104
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and is today one of the best known companies in the world.

105
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Hundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries, and so on.

106
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:43,000
But for me, personally, it was a real change.

107
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto

108
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and living off their leftovers,

109
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:52,000
to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources.

110
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And I wanted to figure out how I could

111
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:58,000
take the blessing of these resources and share it with the world.

112
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And around that time, I met John Gardner,

113
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:02,000
who is a remarkable man.

114
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:07,000
He was the architect of the Great Society programs

115
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:09,000
under Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s.

116
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do,

117
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:14,000
or anyone could do, to make a difference

118
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:17,000
in the long-term issues facing humanity.

119
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And John said, "Bet on good people doing good things.

120
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Bet on good people doing good things."

121
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And that really resonated with me.

122
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I started a foundation

123
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:3,000
to bet on these good people doing good things.

124
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:33,000
These leading, innovative, nonprofit folks,

125
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
who are using business skills in a very leveraged way

126
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:38,000
to solve social problems.

127
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:4,000
People today we call social entrepreneurs.

128
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And to put a face on it, people like Muhammad Yunus,

129
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:45,000
who started the Grameen Bank,

130
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:49,000
has lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world,

131
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:5,000
won the Nobel Peace Prize.

132
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
But there's also a lot of people that you don't know.

133
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Folks like Ann Cotton, who started a group called CAMFED in Africa,

134
0:06:57,000 --> 0:07:,000
because she felt girls' education was lagging.

135
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And she started it about 10 years ago,

136
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and today, she educates over a quarter million African girls.

137
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale,

138
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:13,000
who started the world's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company,

139
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis,

140
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:21,000
also known as black fever.

141
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease,

142
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:27,000
which is really a scourge in the developing world.

143
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And so this is one way to bet

144
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:3,000
on good people doing good things.

145
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change

146
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that I find really is powerful.

147
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It's what we call, "Invest, connect and celebrate."

148
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And invest: if you see good people doing good things,

149
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:45,000
invest in them. Invest in their organizations,

150
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:47,000
or in business. Invest in these folks.

151
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Connecting them together through conferences --

152
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:53,000
like a TED -- brings so many powerful connections,

153
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:56,000
or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship

154
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that my foundation does at Oxford every year.

155
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And celebrate them: tell their stories,

156
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
because not only are there good people doing good work,

157
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:08,000
but their stories can help close these gaps of hope.

158
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And it was this last part of the mission, the celebrate part,

159
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that really got me back to thinking when I was a kid

160
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and wanted to tell stories to get people involved

161
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:2,000
in the issues that affect us all.

162
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And a light bulb went off,

163
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:27,000
which was, first, that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself, I could find writers.

164
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And then the next light bulb was, better than just writing,

165
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:34,000
what about film and TV, to get out to people in a big way?

166
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And I thought about the films that inspired me,

167
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:39,000
films like "Gandhi" and "Schindler's List."

168
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today.

169
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And there really wasn't a specific company

170
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that was focused on the public interest.

171
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So, in 2003, I started to make my way around Los Angeles

172
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company

173
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and I was met with a lot of encouragement.

174
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:02,000
One of the lines of encouragement

175
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that I heard over and over was,

176
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:08,000
"The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you,

177
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:11,000
who think you're going to come to this town and make movies."

178
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And then of course, there was the other adage.

179
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:15,000
"The surest way to become a millionaire

180
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:18,000
is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business."

181
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Laughter)

182
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Undeterred, in January of 2004, I started Participant Productions

183
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:28,000
with the vision to be a global media company

184
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:29,000
focused on the public interest.

185
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And our mission is to produce entertainment

186
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that creates and inspires social change.

187
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And we don't just want people to see our movies

188
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and say, that was fun, and forget about it.

189
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We want them to actually get involved in the issues.

190
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:45,000
In 2005, we launched our first slate of films,

191
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:48,000
"Murder Ball," "North Country," "Syriana"

192
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and "Good Night and Good Luck."

193
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And much to my surprise, they were noticed.

194
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:55,000
We ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films.

195
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy.

196
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:,000
Perhaps more importantly,

197
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:04,000
tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs

198
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and the activism programs

199
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:08,000
that we created to go around the movies.

200
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And we had an online component of that,

201
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:13,000
our community sect called Participate.net.

202
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:18,000
But with our social sector partners, like the ACLU and PBS and the

203
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Sierra Club and the NRDC, once people saw the film,

204
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:24,000
there was actually something they could do to make a difference.

205
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:3,000
One of these films in particular, called "North Country," was actually

206
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:32,000
kind of a box office disaster.

207
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But it was a film that starred Charlize Theron

208
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and it was about women's rights, women's empowerment,

209
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:41,000
domestic violence and so on.

210
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And we released the film at the same time that

211
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:49,000
the Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act.

212
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And with screenings on the Hill, and discussions,

213
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and with our social sector partners,

214
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:56,000
like the National Organization of Women,

215
0:10:57,000 --> 0:10:59,000
the film was widely credited

216
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:03,000
with influencing the successful renewal of the act.

217
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And that to me, spoke volumes, because it's --

218
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:09,000
the film started about a true-life story

219
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:13,000
about a woman who was harassed, sued her employer,

220
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:16,000
led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act,

221
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and the Violence Against Women Act and others.

222
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And then the movie about this person doing these things,

223
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:24,000
then led to this greater renewal.

224
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And so again,

225
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
it goes back to betting on good people doing good things.

226
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Speaking of which, our fellow TEDster, Al --

227
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I first saw Al do his slide show presentation

228
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:39,000
on global warming in May of 2005.

229
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:43,000
At that point, I thought I knew something about global warming.

230
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem.

231
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And after we saw his slide show,

232
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:49,000
it became clear that it was much more urgent.

233
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, and

234
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:56,000
with Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David,

235
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and Davis Guggenheim,

236
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:02,000
who was running documentaries for Participant at the time.

237
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And with Al's blessing, we decided on the spot to turn it into a film,

238
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:09,000
because we felt that we could get the message out there

239
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:13,000
far more quickly than having Al go around the world,

240
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:15,000
speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time.

241
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And you know, there's another adage in Hollywood,

242
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:2,000
that nobody knows nothing about anything.

243
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And I really thought this was going to be

244
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:26,000
a straight-to-PBS charitable initiative.

245
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And so it was a great shock to all of us

246
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:32,000
when the film really captured the public interest,

247
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland,

248
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and most of Scandinavia.

249
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:44,000
We've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.

250
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and it's really changed the debate on global warming.

251
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:5,000
It was also a pretty good year for this guy.

252
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:53,000
We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming.

253
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:55,000
(Laughter)

254
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And for Participant, this is just the start.

255
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world.

256
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And we have 10 films in production right now,

257
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and dozens others in development.

258
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:09,000
I'll quickly talk about a few coming up.

259
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:13,000
One is "Charlie Wilson's War," with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.

260
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, and

261
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
how he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.

262
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And we're also doing a movie called "The Kite Runner,"

263
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:27,000
based on the book "The Kite Runner," also about Afghanistan.

264
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And we think once people see these films,

265
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:31,000
they'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world

266
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and the Middle East in general.

267
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
We premiered a film called "The Chicago 10" at Sundance this year.

268
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:41,000
It's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in 1968,

269
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Abby Hoffman and crew,

270
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and, again, a story about a small group of individuals

271
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:49,000
who did make change in the world.

272
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And a documentary that we're doing on Jimmy Carter

273
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and his Mid-East peace efforts over the years.

274
0:13:55,000 --> 0:14:,000
And in particular, we've been following him on his recent book tour,

275
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:03,000
which, as many of you know, has been very non-controversial --

276
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:04,000
(Laughter)

277
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:07,000
-- which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie.

278
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:11,000
In closing, I'd like to say that everybody has the opportunity

279
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:13,000
to make change in their own way.

280
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And all the people in this room

281
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
have done so through their business lives,

282
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:21,000
or their philanthropic work, or their other interests.

283
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And one thing that I've learned

284
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:26,000
is that there's never one right way to make change.

285
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
One can do it as a tech person, or as a finance person,

286
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:33,000
or a nonprofit person, or as an entertainment person,

287
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
but every one of us is all of those things and more.

288
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And I believe if we do these things,

289
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:44,000
we can close the opportunity gaps, we can close the hope gaps.

290
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And I can imagine, if we do this,

291
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:49,000
the headlines in 10 years might read something like these:

292
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:54,000
"New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero,"

293
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:57,000
"U.S. Imports its Last Barrel of Oil" --

294
0:14:57,000 --> 0:14:59,000
(Applause)

295
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:03,000
-- "Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate

296
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:05,000
10 Years of Peaceful Coexistence."

297
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:08,000
(Applause)

298
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And I like this one, "Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro."

299
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:11,000
(Laughter)

300
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And finally, an eBay listing for one well-traveled slide show,

301
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:23,000
now obsolete, museum piece. Please contact Al Gore.

302
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And I believe that, working together,

303
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:29,000
we can make all of these things happen.

304
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And I want to thank you all for having me here today.

305
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:33,000
It's been a real honor. Thank you.

306
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
(Applause)

307
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Oh, thank you.

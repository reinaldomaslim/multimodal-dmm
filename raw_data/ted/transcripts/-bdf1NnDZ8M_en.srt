1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be.

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And in my idea, heaven is satisfied curiosity.

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
where I can just lie down with my belly down,

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
like I was watching TV when I was a child, and my elbows up.

6
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And I can basically look everywhere I want,

7
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
see every movie I've always wanted to see.

8
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes

9
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
in the subway in New York when you're reading,

10
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
there's something really soothing and easy.

11
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Well, the funny thing is that I already have that kind of life, in a way,

12
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
because I discovered ...

13
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
it took me a while to understand it,

14
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
but when I discovered around 24 years of age that I was much more comfortable

15
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
with objects than with people, I finally decided to really embrace this passion.

16
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And I basically live my life in sort of a trance,

17
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and I look around and everything I see is just the beginning of a long story.

18
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Just to give you an example:

19
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
this is the exhibition, Humble Masterpieces, as it was at MoMA in 2004.

20
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
We were in Queens,

21
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
we were building the big, big, big, big building in Midtown,

22
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
so we were in the small, small, small boondocks.

23
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
That was one of the funnest moments of my career.

24
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But it's not only that.

25
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The typeface -- the typeface is Helvetica;

26
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
it's its 50th anniversary this year.

27
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And so I start thinking -- Max Miedinger and all those Swiss designers together,

28
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
trying to outdo Akzidenz-Grotesk, and come up with a new sans-serif typeface --

29
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and the movie starts playing in my head already.

30
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And of course, you can imagine, with Humble Masterpieces

31
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
it was the same thing multiplied by a hundred.

32
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And I do hope, by the way, that the real goal of the exhibition

33
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is going to have the same effect on you.

34
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ...

35
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
you know when they do homeworks at home?

36
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Instead of having a tray with two peas, I was hoping that they would go

37
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
into the kitchen cabinet or the mother's handbag

38
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and do their museum-quality design collection on a tray.

39
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So, everybody's always suggesting new humble masterpieces,

40
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and at MoMA we put out some books

41
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
just for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces.

42
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And when you do that, usually you get 80 percent porn and 20 percent real suggestions,

43
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and instead it was all -- almost -- all good suggestions.

44
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And a lot of nationalism came in.

45
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
For instance, I didn't know that the Spaniards invented the mop,

46
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but they were very proud

47
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
so every Spaniard said "la frego." And Italians did the pizza.

48
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And I wanted to show you, also, the suggestions from Kentucky are pretty good --

49
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
they had moonshine, laundry detergents and liquid nails.

50
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And I keep it going, and I just got,

51
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
also, this suggestion from Milan:

53
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
it's our traffic divider, which we call "panettone," and it's painted;

54
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
it's these beautiful concrete things that you use around Milan

55
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
to define all the lanes of traffic.

56
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So, think of your own,

57
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
send them on if you want to -- they're always welcome.

58
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But an exhibition like that made me understand even more

59
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
what I've been thinking of for 13 years ever since I got to MoMA.

60
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I'm Italian. In Italy, design is normal.

61
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Different parts of the world have a knack for different things.

62
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I was just recently in Argentina and in Uruguay,

63
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and the default way of building homes in the country is a beautiful modernism

64
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that you don't see elsewhere, but the contemporary art was terrible.

65
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
In Italy, in Milan especially,

66
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
contemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place.

67
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
But design -- oh, my God.

68
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
What you find at the store at the corner, without going to any kind of fancy store,

69
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
is the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that

70
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
we are all so sophisticated.

71
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It's just what you find at the store.

72
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And New York has another kind of knack for contemporary art.

73
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I'm always amazed -- three-year-olds know who Richard Serra is

74
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and take you to the galleries.

75
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But design, for some reason, is still misunderstood for decoration.

76
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It's really interesting:

77
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
what many people think when I say the word "design" is they think of

78
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
this kind of overdesigned -- in this case, it's overdesigned on purpose, but --

79
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
decoration, interior decoration.

80
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
They think of somebody choosing fabrics.

81
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Design can be that, of course, but it can also be this.

82
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It can be a school of design in Jerusalem that tries to find a better way

83
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to design gas masks for people,

84
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
because, as you know, Israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies.

85
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So, what these designers do is they find a way to lower the neckline,

86
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
so that instead of being completely strangled, a teenager can also sip a Coke.

87
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
They tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler

88
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important.

89
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And then they make a little tent for the baby.

90
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
However cruel, however ruthless you can think this is it's a great design,

91
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and it is miles away from the fancy furniture,

92
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
but still, it's part of my same field of passion.

93
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
What I've been doing at MoMA since the beginning is to try to

94
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
harness the power of MoMA

95
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
because it's great to work there. You really have power

96
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions,

97
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and that is power because in a design museum I wouldn't have as many visitors.

98
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I'm very well aware that 80 percent of my public is there to see Picasso and Matisse,

99
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and then they stumble upon my show and I keep them there.

100
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
But what I've been trying to do is something that the curators at MoMA

101
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
in my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in 1929,

102
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
which is to try and see what's going on in the world

103
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and try to use that authority in order to make things better.

104
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
There have been many episodes,

105
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience,

106
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
but in two instances, his great-grandfather, grandfather --

107
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I'm always a little perplexed about the relation, exactly --

108
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Charles Eames the first time and then Charles and Ray Eames the second time

109
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
were involved in two competitions:

110
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
one in 1940, it was about organic furniture, and the second one in 1948

111
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
was low-cost furniture for the GIs coming back from the war

112
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that then sparked a whole line of furniture.

113
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And then there was good design for very low price.

114
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
There were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about

115
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life.

116
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So, I started out in '95 with this exhibition that was called

117
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Mutant Materials in Contemporary Design.

118
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It was about a new phase, in my opinion, in the world of design

119
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
in that materials could be customized by the designers themselves.

120
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And that put me in touch with such diverse design examples as the aerogels

121
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
from the Lawrence Livermore Lab in California;

122
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
at that time, they were beginning to be brought into the civilian market.

123
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And at the same time, the gorgeous work of Takeshi Ishiguro, who did these

124
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
beautiful salt-and-pepper containers that are made of rice dough.

125
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So you see, the range is really quite diverse.

126
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And then, for instance, this other exhibition

127
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that was entitled Workspheres in 2001,

128
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
where I asked different designers to come up with ideas for

129
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time.

130
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And you see IDEO there.

131
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
It was beautiful -- it was called Personal Skies.

132
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The idea was that if you had a cubicle, you could project a sky on top

133
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
of your head and have your own "Cielo in Una Stanza" -- a sky in a room --

134
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
it's a very famous Italian song.

135
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And other examples: this was Marti Guixe about working on the go,

136
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and Hella Jongerius, my favorite, about how to work at home.

137
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And this lets me introduce a very important idea about design:

138
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
designers are the biggest synthesizers in the world.

139
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
What they do best is make a synthesis of human needs,

140
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
current conditions in economy, in materials, in sustainability issues,

141
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and then what they do at the end -- if they are good --

142
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
is much more than the sum of its parts.

143
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Hella Jongerius is a person that is able to make a synthesis

144
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that is really quite amazing

145
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and also quite hilarious.

146
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
The idea behind her work was that

147
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
at that time, everybody was saying you have to really divide your life.

148
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Instead, she said, "No, no. Work and leisure can be together."

149
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Yeah, that's particularly gorgeous -- it's the TV dinner of 2001.

150
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
There have been many other exhibitions in the meantime,

151
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
but I don't want to focus on my shows.

152
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I would like, instead, to talk about how great some designers are.

153
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
I've always had a hard time with the word "maverick."

154
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I came to the United States 13 years ago, and to this day

155
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I have to ask, "What does that mean?"

156
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So, this morning I went to see on the dictionary and it said that

157
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
there was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle.

158
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Therefore, he was not following everybody's lead,

159
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and therefore, he was a maverick.

160
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So, designers do need to be mavericks,

161
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
because the best way to design a successful object --

162
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and also an object that we were missing before --

163
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
is to pretend that either it never existed

164
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
or that people will be able to have a new behavior with it.

165
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So, Safe is the last exhibition that I did at MoMA

166
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and it ended at the beginning of last year.

167
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
It was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection.

168
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It's a long story because it started before 2001 and it was called Emergency.

169
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And then when 9/11 happened, I had a shock and I canceled the exhibition

170
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
until, slowly but surely, it came back --

171
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
as a half-full glass instead of half-empty --

172
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and it was about protection and safety.

173
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
But it ranged from such items as a complete de-mining equipment to

174
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
these kind of water-sterilizing straws,

175
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
so it was really wide-ranging.

176
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It also had ... you know, Cameron and I worked a little bit together,

177
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition.

178
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But what is interesting is that we don't need to talk about design and art anymore;

179
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
design uses whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point.

180
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
It's a sense of economy and a sense, also, of humor.

181
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
This is a beautiful project by Ralph Borland, who's South African.

182
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
It's a suit for civil disobedience.

183
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
The idea is that when you have a riot or a protest

184
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and the police comes towards you, you're wearing this thing --

185
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
it's like a big heart and it has a loudspeaker over your heart

186
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
so your heartbeat is amplified --

187
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and the police is reminded;

188
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
it's like having a flower in front of the rifle.

189
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And also, you can imagine, a whole group of people with the same suit

190
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
will have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police.

191
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So, designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately

192
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
functional, but they're functional to our understanding of issues.

193
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Tony Dunne and Fiona Raby

194
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia,

195
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
like this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor

196
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
so it disappears completely and you can hide away;

197
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
or even better, the huggable atomic mushroom, which got me an article

198
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
on the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of the United States --

199
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I don't think it ever happened before at MoMA;

200
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
or this Faraday Chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations.

201
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that

202
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
the ultimate shelter is your sense of self,

203
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic.

204
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
This is Cindy van den Bremen, who is a Dutch designer

205
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that's done this series of Capsters.

206
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
They are athletic gear for Muslim women that enable them to ski, play tennis,

207
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
do whatever they want to do without having to uncap themselves.

208
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And sometimes by doing this kind of research,

209
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
you encounter such beautiful ideas of design.

210
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Twan Verdonck is really young, I think he's 27, and working together with

211
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
some psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensorial

212
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
stimulation for children that have psychological impairments.

213
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
They're quite beautiful.

214
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
They range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you --

215
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
because autistic children like to be hugged tight, so it has a spring inside --

216
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself

217
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
in the mirror and regain a sense of self.

218
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Design really looks upon the whole world

219
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and it considers the world in all of its different ranges.

220
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the Herald Tribune in Istanbul.

221
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And it was really interesting because I was the last speaker

222
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury,

223
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time

224
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality.

225
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury,

226
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and there's luxury that is relative for people that don't have that much.

227
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I want to make this point by showing you two examples of

228
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
design coming from a sense of economy -- very, very clear limits.

229
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
This is Cuba, and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell,

230
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks.

231
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So they're quite beautiful, but they're beautiful because

232
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
they're so smart and economical.

233
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And here is the work of two brothers from Sao Paulo,

234
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Fernando and Humberto Campana, who got inspired by the poverty and

235
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are

236
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
selling for an enormous amount of money.

237
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
But that's because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself.

238
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
So really, design takes everything into account,

239
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and the interesting thing is that as the technology advances,

240
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
as we become more and more wireless and impalpable,

241
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
designers, instead, want us to be hands-on.

242
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Sometimes hammer-on.

243
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
This is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically.

244
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes

245
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
your imprint, all the way to this beautiful series of objects

246
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
that are considered design by Ana Mir in Barcelona.

247
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
From this kind of bijou made with human hair to these chocolate nipples

248
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
to these intra-toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes.

249
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
(Laughter)

250
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
It's quite beautiful because somehow, this is a gorgeous moment for design.

251
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Many years ago I heard a mathematician from Vienna, whose name was Marchetti,

252
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
explain how the innovation in the military industry --

253
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
therefore, secret innovation -- and the innovation in the

254
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
civilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed.

255
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And that makes sense.

256
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
In moments of war there's great technological innovation,

257
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and in the world you have to do without --

258
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
well, during the Second World War, you had to do without steel,

259
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
you had to do without aluminum.

260
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And then as peace comes, all of these technologies get all of a sudden

261
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
available for the civilian market.

262
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Many of you might know that the Potato Chip Chair

263
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
by Charles and Ray Eames comes exactly from that kind of instance:

264
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden.

265
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
I think that this is a strange moment.

266
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
The rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously,

267
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
just like the rhythm of our life in the past 25 years,

268
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
so I'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is.

269
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
But it surely is a very important moment for design,

270
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
because not only is the technology proceeding, not only is computing

271
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
technology making open-source possible also in the world of design,

272
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
but also the idea of sustainability --

273
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
which is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of CO2 emissions and footprint,

274
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
but also sustainability of human interrelationships --

275
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
is very much part of the work of so many designers.

276
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And that's why designers, more and more, are working on behaviors

277
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
rather than on objects.

278
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Especially the good ones, not all of them.

279
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
I wanted to show you, for instance, the work of Mathieu Lehanneur,

280
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
which is quite fantastic.

281
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
He's another young designer from France who's working --

282
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and at this point he's working, also, with pharmaceutical companies --

283
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
on new ways to engage patients, especially children,

284
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
in taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty.

285
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
For instance, this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine

286
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
that kind of inflates itself when it's time for you to take the medicine,

287
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:51,000
so the child has to go -- pffff! -- to release and relieve the container itself.

288
0:16:51.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
And this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin,

289
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
so intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved

290
0:16:59.16,000 --> 0:17:01,000
in this particular kind of delivery.

291
0:17:01.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Similarly, there's the work of people like Marti Guixe that tries to involve

292
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
you in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth

293
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
so that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste, orally.

294
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
The next show that I'm going to work on --

295
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and I've been bugging a lot of you about this here --

296
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
is about the relationship between design and science.

297
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
I'm trying to find not the metaphors, but, rather, the points in common --

298
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
the common gripes, the common issues, the common preoccupations --

299
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
and I think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design

300
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
as an instruction, as a direction rather than a prescription of form.

301
0:17:46.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
And I am hoping that many of you will respond to this.

302
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:53,000
I've sent an email already to quite a few of you.

303
0:17:53.16,000 --> 0:17:56,000
But design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales,

304
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
and therefore, really work at the scale of the very small

305
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
to make it very big and very meaningful.

306
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Thank you. (Applause)

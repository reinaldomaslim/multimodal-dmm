1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I want to talk about penguins today.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
But first, I want to start by saying that

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
we need a new operating system,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
for the oceans and for the Earth.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
When I came to the Galapagos 40 years ago,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
there were 3,000 people

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that lived in the Galapagos.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Now there are over 30,000.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
There were two Jeeps on Santa Cruz.

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Now, there are around a thousand trucks

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and buses and cars there.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So the fundamental problems that we face

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
are overconsumption and too many people.

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It's the same problems in the Galapagos,

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
except, obviously,

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
it's worse here, in some ways, than other places.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Because we've only doubled the population of the Earth

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
since the 1960s -- a little more than doubled --

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but we have 6.7 billion people in the world,

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and we all like to consume.

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And one of the major problems that we have

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
is our operating system

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
is not giving us the proper feedback.

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
We're not paying the true

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
environmental costs of our actions.

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And when I came at age 22 to live on Fernandina,

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
let me just say, that I had never

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
camped before.

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I had never lived alone

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
for any period of time,

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and I'd never slept with sea lions

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
snoring next to me all night.

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But moreover, I'd never lived on an uninhabited island.

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Punta Espinosa is where I lived for over a year,

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and we call it uninhabited

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
because there are no people there.

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But it's alive with life;

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
it's hardly uninhabited.

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So a lot has happened in the last 40 years,

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and what I learned when I came to the Galapagos

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
is the importance of wild places, wild things,

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
certainly wildlife,

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
and the amazing qualities that penguins have.

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Penguins are real athletes:

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
They can swim 173 kilometers in a day.

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
They can swim at the same speed day and night --

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that's faster than any Olympic swimmer.

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I mean, they can do like seven kilometers an hour

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and sustain it.

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But what is really amazing, because of this deepness here,

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Emperor penguins can go down

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
more than 500 meters

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and they can hold their breath for 23 minutes.

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Magellanic penguins, the ones that I work on,

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
they can dive to about 90 meters

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and they can stay down for

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
about 4.6 minutes.

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Humans, without fins: 90 meters, 3.5 minutes.

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And I doubt anybody in this room

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
could really hold their breath for 3.5 minutes.

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
You have to train to be able to do that.

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So penguins are amazing athletes.

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The other thing is, I've never met anybody

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that really doesn't say that they like penguins.

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
They're comical, they walk upright,

66
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and, of course, they're diligent.

67
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And, more importantly, they're well-dressed.

68
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So they have all the criteria

69
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
that people normally like.

70
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
But scientifically, they're amazing because they're sentinels.

71
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
They tell us about our world in a lot of different ways,

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and particularly the ocean.

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
This is a picture of a Galapagos penguin

74
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that's on the front of a little zodiac here in the Galapagos.

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And that's what I came to study.

76
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I thought I was going to study the social behavior of Galapagos penguins,

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
but you already know

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
penguins are rare.

79
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
These are the rarest penguins in the world.

80
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Why I thought I was going to be able to do that, I don't know.

81
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But the population has changed

82
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
dramatically since I was first here.

83
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
When I counted penguins for the first time

84
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and tried to do a census,

85
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
we just counted all the individual beaks that we could

86
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
around all these islands.

87
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
We counted around 2,000, so I don't know how many penguins there really are,

88
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but I know I can count 2,000.

89
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
If you go and do it now, the national parks

90
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
count about 500.

91
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So we have a quarter of the penguins

92
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that we did 40 years ago.

93
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And this is true of most of our living systems.

94
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We have less than we had before,

95
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and most of them are in fairly steep decline.

96
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And I want to just show you a little bit about why.

97
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Braying)

98
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
That's a penguin braying

99
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to tell you that

100
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
it's important to pay attention to penguins.

101
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Most important of all,

102
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I didn't know what that was the first time I heard it.

103
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And you can imagine sleeping on Fernandina your first night there

104
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and you hear this lonesome, plaintful call.

105
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I fell in love with penguins,

106
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and it certainly has changed the rest of my life.

107
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
What I found out I was studying

108
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
is really the difference in how the Galapagos changes,

109
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
the most extreme variation.

110
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
You've heard about these El Ninos,

111
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
but this is the extreme that penguins all over the world

112
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
have to adapt to.

113
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
This is a cold-water event

114
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
called La Nina.

115
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Where it's blue and it's green, it means the water is really cold.

116
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And so you can see this current coming up --

117
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
in this case, the Humboldt Current --

118
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that comes all the way out to the Galapagos Islands,

119
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and this deep undersea current, the Cromwell Current,

120
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that upwells around the Galapagos.

121
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
That brings all the nutrients:

122
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
When this is cold in the Galapagos,

123
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
it's rich, and there's plenty of food for everyone.

124
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
When we have extreme El Nino events,

125
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
you see all this red,

126
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and you see no green

127
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
out here around the Galapagos.

128
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
That means that there's no upwelling,

129
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and there's basically no food.

130
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So it's a real desert

131
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
for not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas ...

132
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
things die when there's no food.

133
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But we didn't even know that that

134
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
affected the Galapagos when I went to study penguins.

135
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And you can imagine being on an island hoping you're going to see penguins,

136
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and you're in the middle of an El Nino event

137
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and there are no penguins.

138
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
They're not breeding; they're not even around.

139
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I studied marine iguanas at that point.

140
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But this is a global phenomenon, we know that.

141
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And if you look along the coast of Argentina, where I work now,

142
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
at a place called Punta Tombo --

143
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world

144
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
down here about 44 degrees south latitude --

145
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
you see that there's great variation here.

146
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Some years, the cold water

147
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
goes all the way up to Brazil,

148
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and other years, in these La Nina years, it doesn't.

149
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So the oceans don't always act together; they act differently,

150
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but that is the kind of variation

151
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that penguins have to live with,

152
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and it's not easy.

153
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So when I went to study the Magellanic penguins,

154
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I didn't have any problems.

155
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
There were plenty of them.

156
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
This is a picture at Punta Tombo in February

157
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
showing all the penguins along the beach.

158
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I went there because the Japanese wanted to start harvesting them

159
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and turning them into high fashion golf gloves,

160
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
protein and oil.

161
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Fortunately, nobody has harvested any penguins

162
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and we're getting over 100,000 tourists a year to see them.

163
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But the population is declining

164
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and it's declined fairly substantially, about 21 percent

165
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
since 1987, when I started these surveys,

166
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
in terms of number of active nests.

167
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Here, you can see where Punta Tombo is,

168
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and they breed in incredibly dense colonies.

169
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We know this because of long-term science,

170
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
because we have long-term studies there.

171
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And science is important in informing decision makers,

172
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and also in changing how we do

173
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and knowing the direction of change that we're going in.

174
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And so we have this penguin project. The Wildlife Conservation Society

175
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
has funded me along with a lot of individuals

176
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
over the last 27 years

177
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
to be able to produce these kinds of maps.

178
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And also, we know that it's not only

179
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Galapagos penguins that are in trouble,

180
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
but Magellanics and many other species of penguins.

181
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And so we have started a global penguin society

182
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
to try to focus on the real plight of penguins.

183
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
This is one of the plights of penguins: oil pollution.

184
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Penguins don't like oil

185
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and they don't like to swim through oil.

186
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
The nice thing is, if you look down here in Argentina,

187
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
there's no surface oil pollution from this composite map.

188
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
But, in fact, when we went to Argentina,

189
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
penguins were often found

190
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
totally covered in oil.

191
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So they were just minding their own business.

192
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
They ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it.

193
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Because when tankers carry oil

194
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
they have to have ballast at some point,

195
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
so when they're empty, they have the ballast water in there.

196
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
When they come back, they actually dump

197
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
this oily ballast water into the ocean.

198
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Why do they do that? Because it's cheaper,

199
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
because they don't pay the real environmental costs.

200
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
We usually don't, and we want to start

201
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
getting the accounting system right

202
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
so we can pay the real cost.

203
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
At first, the Argentine government said, "No, there's no way.

204
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
You can't find oiled penguins in Argentina.

205
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We have laws,

206
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and we can't have illegal dumping; it's against the law."

207
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So we ended up spending nine years

208
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins.

209
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
In some years, like this year, we found

210
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
more than 80 percent

211
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
of the adult penguins dead on the beach

212
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
were covered in oil.

213
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
These little blue dots are the fledglings --

214
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
we do this survey every March --

215
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
which means that they're only in the environment

216
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
from January until March,

217
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
so maybe three months at the most

218
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that they could get covered in oil.

219
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And you can see, in some years over 60 percent

220
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
of the fledglings were oiled.

221
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Eventually, the government listened

222
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and, amazingly, they changed their laws.

223
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
They moved the tanker lanes

224
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
40 kilometers farther off shore,

225
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and people are not doing as much illegal dumping.

226
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So what we're seeing now

227
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
is very few penguins are oiled.

228
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Why are there even these penguins oiled?

229
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Because we've solved the problem in Chubut province,

230
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
which is like a state in Argentina

231
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
where Punta Tombo is --

232
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
so that's about 1,000 kilometers of coastline --

233
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
but we haven't solved the problem

234
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
in northern Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil.

235
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So now I want to show you that penguins are affected.

236
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I'm just going to talk about two things.

237
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
This is climate change. Now this has really been a fun study

238
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
because I put satellite tags on the back

239
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
of these Magellanic penguins.

240
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Try to convince donors to give you a couple thousand dollars

241
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to glue a satellite tag on the back of penguins.

242
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
But we've been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go.

243
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
We thought we needed a marine protected area

244
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
of about 30 kilometers,

245
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and then we put a satellite tag on the back of a penguin.

246
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And what the penguins show us --

247
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and these are all the little dots

248
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
from where the penguins' positions were

249
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
for penguins in incubation in 2003 --

250
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and what you see is some of these individuals

251
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
are going 800 kilometers away from their nests.

252
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So that means as their mate

253
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
is sitting on the nest incubating the eggs,

254
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
the other one is out there foraging,

255
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and the longer they have to stay gone,

256
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
the worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back.

257
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And, of course, all of this then leads to a vicious cycle

258
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and you can't raise a lot of chicks.

259
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Here you see in 2003 --

260
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
these are all the dots of where the penguins are --

261
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
they were raising a little over

262
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
a half of a chick.

263
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Here, you can see in 2006,

264
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
they raised almost three quarters

265
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
of a chick per nest,

266
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and you can see that they're closer to Punta Tombo;

267
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
they're not going as far away.

268
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
This past year, in 2009,

269
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
you can see that they're now raising

270
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
about a fourth of a chick,

271
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and some of these individuals are going

272
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
more than 900 kilometers away from their nests.

273
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So it's kind of like you having a job in Chicago,

274
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and then you get transferred

275
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to St. Louis,

276
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and your mate is not happy about this

277
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
because you've got to pay airfare,

278
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
because you're gone longer.

279
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
The same thing's true for penguins as well.

280
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And they're going about, on average now,

281
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
40 kilometers farther than they did a decade ago.

282
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
We need to be able to get information out to the general public.

283
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And so we started a publication

284
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
with the Society for Conservation

285
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that we think presents cutting-edge science

286
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
in a new, novel way,

287
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
because we have reporters that are good writers

288
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
that actually can distill the information

289
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and make it accessible to the general public.

290
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
So if you're interested in cutting-edge science

291
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and smarter conservation,

292
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
you should join with our 11 partners --

293
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
some of them here in this room, like the Nature Conservancy --

294
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and look at this magazine

295
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
because we need to get information out about conservation

296
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
to the general public.

297
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Lastly I want to say that

298
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
all of you, probably,

299
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
have had some relationship at some time in your life

300
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
with a dog, a cat, some sort of pet,

301
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and you recognized that those are individuals.

302
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And some of you consider them almost part of your family.

303
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
If you had a relationship with a penguin,

304
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
you'd see it in the same sort of way.

305
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
They're amazing creatures

306
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
that really change how you view the world

307
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
because they're not that different from us:

308
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
They're trying to make a living,

309
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
they're trying to raise their offspring,

310
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
they're trying to get on and survive in the world.

311
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
This is Turbo the Penguin.

312
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Turbo's never been fed.

313
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
He met us and got his name

314
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
because he started standing under

315
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
my diesel truck: a turbo truck,

316
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
so we named him Turbo.

317
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak,

318
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
we let him in and he comes in here.

319
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And I just wanted to show you

320
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
what happened one day

321
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
when Turbo brought in a friend.

322
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
So this is Turbo.

323
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
He's coming up to one of my graduate students and flipper patting,

324
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
which he would do to a female penguin.

325
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And you can see, he's not trying to bite.

326
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
This guy has never been in before

327
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and he's trying to figure out, "What is going on?

328
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
What is this guy doing?

329
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
This is really pretty weird."

330
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And you'll see soon

331
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that my graduate student ...

332
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and you see, Turbo's pretty intent

333
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
on his flipper patting.

334
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And now he's looking at the other guy,

335
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
saying, "You are really weird."

336
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And now look at this: not friendly.

337
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So penguins really differ in their personalities

338
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
just like our dogs and our cats.

339
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
We're also trying to collect our information

340
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and become more technologically literate.

341
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
So we're trying to put that

342
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
in computers in the field.

343
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And penguins are always involved in helping us

344
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
or not helping us in one way or another.

345
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
This is a radio frequency ID system.

346
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
You put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin

347
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
that has a barcode, so it tells you who it is.

348
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
It walks over the pad, and you know who it is.

349
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Okay, so here are a few penguins coming in.

350
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
See, this one's coming back to its nest.

351
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
They're all coming in at this time,

352
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
walking across there, just kind of leisurely coming in.

353
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Here's a female that's in a hurry. She's got food.

354
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
She's really rushing back, because it's hot,

355
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
to try to feed her chicks.

356
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And then there's another fellow that will leisurely come by.

357
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Look how fat he is. He's walking back to feed his chicks.

358
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Then I realize that they're playing

359
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
king of the box.

360
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
This is my box up here, and this is the system that works.

361
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
You can see this penguin, he goes over, he looks at those wires,

362
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
does not like that wire.

363
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
He unplugs the wire; we have no data.

364
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
(Laughter)

365
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
So, they really are pretty amazing creatures.

366
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
OK.

367
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Most important thing is:

368
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Only you can change yourself,

369
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and only you can change the world

370
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and make it better, for people

371
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
as well as penguins.

372
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
So, thank you very much. (Applause)

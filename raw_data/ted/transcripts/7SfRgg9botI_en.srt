1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
This is actually a painting

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that hangs at the Countway Library at Harvard Medical School.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
In the front, you see, actually, Joe Murray

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
getting the patient ready for the transplant,

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
while in the back room you see Hartwell Harrison,

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
the Chief of Urology at Harvard,

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
actually harvesting the kidney.

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
The kidney was indeed the first organ

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
ever to be transplanted to the human.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
That was back in 1954,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
55 years ago.

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Yet we're still dealing with a lot of the same challenges

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
as many decades ago.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Certainly many advances, many lives saved.

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But we have a major shortage of organs.

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
In the last decade the number of patients

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
waiting for a transplant has doubled.

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
While, at the same time, the actual number of transplants

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
has remained almost entirely flat.

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
That really has to do with our aging population.

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
We're just getting older.

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Medicine is doing a better job

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
of keeping us alive.

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But as we age, our organs tend to fail more.

26
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So, that's a challenge,

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
not just for organs but also for tissues.

28
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Trying to replace pancreas,

29
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
trying to replace nerves that can help us with Parkinson's.

30
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
These are major issues.

31
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
This is actually a very stunning statistic.

32
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Every 30 seconds

33
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
a patient dies from diseases

34
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement.

35
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So, what can we do about it?

36
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
We've talked about stem cells tonight.

37
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
That's a way to do it.

38
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
But still ways to go to get stem cells into patients,

39
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
in terms of actual therapies for organs.

40
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Wouldn't it be great if our bodies could regenerate?

41
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Wouldn't it be great if we could actually harness the power

42
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
of our bodies, to actually heal ourselves?

43
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It's not really that foreign of a concept, actually;

44
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
it happens on the Earth every day.

45
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
This is actually a picture of a salamander.

46
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate.

47
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
You see here a little video.

48
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
This is actually a limb injury in this salamander.

49
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And this is actually real photography,

50
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
timed photography, showing how that limb regenerates

51
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
in a period of days.

52
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
You see the scar form.

53
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And that scar actually grows out

54
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
a new limb.

55
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So, salamanders can do it.

56
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Why can't we? Why can't humans regenerate?

57
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Actually, we can regenerate.

58
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Your body has many organs

59
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and every single organ in your body

60
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
has a cell population

61
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that's ready to take over at the time of injury. It happens every day.

62
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
As you age, as you get older.

63
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Your bones regenerate every 10 years.

64
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Your skin regenerates every two weeks.

65
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So, your body is constantly regenerating.

66
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The challenge occurs when there is an injury.

67
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
At the time of injury or disease,

68
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
the body's first reaction

69
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
is to seal itself off from the rest of the body.

70
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It basically wants to fight off infection,

71
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and seal itself, whether it's organs inside your body,

72
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
or your skin, the first reaction

73
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
is for scar tissue to move in,

74
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to seal itself off from the outside.

75
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So, how can we harness that power?

76
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
One of the ways that we do that

77
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
is actually by using smart biomaterials.

78
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
How does this work? Well, on the left side here

79
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
you see a urethra which was injured.

80
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
This is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body.

81
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And you see that it is injured.

82
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
We basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials

83
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that you can actually use as a bridge.

84
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
If you build that bridge, and you close off

85
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
from the outside environment,

86
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
then you can create that bridge, and cells

87
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that regenerate in your body,

88
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
can then cross that bridge, and take that path.

89
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
That's exactly what you see here.

90
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It's actually a smart biomaterial

91
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that we used, to actually treat this patient.

92
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
This was an injured urethra on the left side.

93
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We used that biomaterial in the middle.

94
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And then, six months later on the right-hand side

95
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
you see this reengineered urethra.

96
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Turns out your body can regenerate,

97
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but only for small distances.

98
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The maximum efficient distance for regeneration

99
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
is only about one centimeter.

100
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So, we can use these smart biomaterials

101
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
but only for about one centimeter

102
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to bridge those gaps.

103
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So, we do regenerate, but for limited distances.

104
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
What do we do now,

105
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
if you have injury for larger organs?

106
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
What do we do when we have injuries

107
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
for structures which are much larger

108
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
than one centimeter?

109
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Then we can start to use cells.

110
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The strategy here, is if a patient comes in to us

111
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
with a diseased or injured organ,

112
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
you can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ,

113
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
less than half the size of a postage stamp,

114
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
you can then tease that tissue apart,

115
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and look at its basic components,

116
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the patient's own cells,

117
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
you take those cells out,

118
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities,

119
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and then we then use scaffold materials.

120
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
To the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse,

121
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
or your shirt, but actually

122
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
these materials are fairly complex

123
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and they are designed to degrade once inside the body.

124
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It disintegrates a few months later.

125
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
It's acting only as a cell delivery vehicle.

126
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It's bringing the cells into the body. It's allowing

127
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
the cells to regenerate new tissue,

128
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away.

129
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And that's what we did for this piece of muscle.

130
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
This is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through

131
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
the structures to actually engineer the muscle.

132
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We take the cells, we expand them,

133
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
we place the cells on the scaffold,

134
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and we then place the scaffold back into the patient.

135
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But actually, before placing the scaffold into the patient,

136
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
we actually exercise it.

137
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
We want to make sure that we condition

138
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
this muscle, so that it knows what to do

139
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
once we put it into the patient.

140
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
That's what you're seeing here. You're seeing

141
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
this muscle bio-reactor

142
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
actually exercising the muscle back and forth.

143
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Okay. These are flat structures that we see here,

144
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
the muscle.

145
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
What about other structures?

146
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
This is actually an engineered blood vessel.

147
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Very similar to what we just did, but a little bit more complex.

148
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Here we take a scaffold,

149
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and we basically -- scaffold can be like a piece of paper here.

150
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And we can then tubularize this scaffold.

151
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And what we do is we, to make a blood vessel, same strategy.

152
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
A blood vessel is made up of two different cell types.

153
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We take muscle cells, we paste,

154
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
or coat the outside with these muscle cells,

155
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
very much like baking a layer cake, if you will.

156
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
You place the muscle cells on the outside.

157
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
You place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside.

158
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
You now have your fully seeded scaffold.

159
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
You're going to place this in an oven-like device.

160
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It has the same conditions as a human body,

161
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
37 degrees centigrade,

162
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
95 percent oxygen.

163
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
You then exercise it, as what you saw on that tape.

164
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered.

165
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
This is actually the artery that goes from your neck to your brain.

166
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And this is an X-ray showing you

167
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
the patent, functional blood vessel.

168
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
More complex structures

169
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
such as blood vessels, urethras, which I showed you,

170
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
they're definitely more complex

171
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
because you're introducing two different cell types.

172
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
But they are really acting mostly as conduits.

173
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
You're allowing fluid or air to go through

174
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
at steady states.

175
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
They are not nearly as complex as hollow organs.

176
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity,

177
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
because you're asking these organs to act on demand.

178
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So, the bladder is one such organ.

179
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Same strategy, we take a very small piece of the bladder,

180
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
less than half the size of a postage stamp.

181
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
We then tease the tissue apart

182
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
into its two individual cell components,

183
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
muscle, and these bladder specialized cells.

184
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
We grow the cells outside the body in large quantities.

185
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ.

186
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
We then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder.

187
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We coat the inside with these bladder lining cells.

188
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We coat the outside with these muscle cells.

189
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
We place it back into this oven-like device.

190
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
From the time you take that piece of tissue, six to eight weeks later

191
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
you can put the organ right back into the patient.

192
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
This actually shows the scaffold.

193
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The material is actually being coated with the cells.

194
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
When we did the first clinical trial for these patients

195
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient.

196
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
We brought patients in,

197
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
six to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery, did X-rays,

198
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient's size

199
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
pelvic cavity.

200
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
For the second phase of the trials

201
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
we just had different sizes, small, medium, large and extra-large.

202
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
(Laughter)

203
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
It's true.

204
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And I'm sure everyone here wanted an extra-large. Right?

205
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
(Laughter)

206
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So, bladders are definitely a little bit more complex

207
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
than the other structures.

208
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it.

209
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
This is actually a heart valve, which we engineered.

210
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy.

211
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
We take the scaffold, we seed it with cells,

212
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and you can now see here, the valve leaflets opening and closing.

213
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We exercise these prior to implantation.

214
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Same strategy.

215
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And then the most complex are the solid organs.

216
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
For solid organs, they're more complex

217
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
because you're using a lot more cells per centimeter.

218
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
This is actually a simple solid organ like the ear.

219
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
It's now being seeded with cartilage.

220
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
That's the oven-like device;

221
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
once it's coated it gets placed there.

222
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold.

223
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
This is actually digits that we're engineering.

224
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
These are being layered, one layer at a time,

225
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
first the bone, we fill in the gaps with cartilage.

226
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
We then start adding the muscle on top.

227
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And you start layering these solid structures.

228
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Again, fairly more complex organs,

229
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
but by far, the most complex solid organs

230
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
are actually the vascularized, highly vascularized,

231
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
a lot of blood vessel supply,

232
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
organs such as the heart,

233
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
the liver, the kidneys.

234
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
This is actually an example -- several strategies

235
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
to engineer solid organs.

236
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
This is actually one of the strategies. We use a printer.

237
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And instead of using ink, we use -- you just saw an inkjet cartridge --

238
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
we just use cells.

239
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
This is actually your typical desktop printer.

240
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
It's actually printing this two chamber heart,

241
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
one layer at a time.

242
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
You see the heart coming out there. It takes about 40 minutes to print,

243
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and about four to six hours later

244
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
you see the muscle cells contract.

245
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
(Applause)

246
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
This technology was developed by Tao Ju, who worked at our institute.

247
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And this is actually still, of course, experimental,

248
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
not for use in patients.

249
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Another strategy that we have followed

250
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
is actually to use decellularized organs.

251
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
We actually take donor organs,

252
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
organs that are discarded,

253
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and we then can use very mild detergents

254
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
to take all the cell elements out of these organs.

255
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
So, for example on the left panel,

256
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
top panel, you see a liver.

257
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
We actually take the donor liver,

258
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
we use very mild detergents,

259
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and we, by using these mild detergents, we take all the cells

260
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
out of the liver.

261
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Two weeks later, we basically can lift this organ up,

262
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
it feels like a liver,

263
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
we can hold it like a liver,

264
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
it looks like a liver, but it has no cells.

265
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
All we are left with

266
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
is the skeleton, if you will, of the liver,

267
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
all made up of collagen,

268
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
a material that's in our bodies, that will not reject.

269
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
We can use it from one patient to the next.

270
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
We then take this vascular structure

271
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply.

272
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
You can see, actually that's a fluoroscopy.

273
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
We're actually injecting contrast into the organ.

274
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Now you can see it start. We're injecting the contrast into the organ

275
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
into this decellularized liver.

276
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And you can see the vascular tree that remains intact.

277
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
We then take the cells, the vascular cells,

278
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
blood vessel cells, we perfuse the vascular tree

279
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
with the patient's own cells.

280
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
We perfuse the outside of the liver

281
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
with the patient's own liver cells.

282
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And we can then create functional livers.

283
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And that's actually what you're seeing.

284
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
This is still experimental. But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality

285
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
of the liver structure, experimentally.

286
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
For the kidney,

287
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
as I talked to you about the first painting that you saw,

288
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
the first slide I showed you,

289
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
90 percent of the patients on the transplant wait list

290
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
are waiting for a kidney, 90 percent.

291
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So, another strategy we're following

292
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
is actually to create wafers

293
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
that we stack together, like an accordion, if you will.

294
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So, we stack these wafers together, using the kidney cells.

295
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And then you can see these miniature kidneys that we've engineered.

296
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
They are actually making urine.

297
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Again, small structures, our challenge is how to make them larger,

298
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and that is something we're working on

299
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
right now at the institute.

300
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
One of the things that I wanted to summarize for you then

301
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
is what is a strategy that we're going for in regenerative medicine.

302
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
If at all possible,

303
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
we really would like to use smart biomaterials

304
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
that we can just take off the shelf

305
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and regenerate your organs.

306
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
We are limited with distances right now,

307
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time.

308
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
If we cannot use smart biomaterials,

309
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
then we'd rather use your very own cells.

310
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Why? Because they will not reject.

311
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
We can take cells from you,

312
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
create the structure, put it right back into you, they will not reject.

313
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And if possible, we'd rather use the cells from your very specific organ.

314
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
If you present with a diseased wind pipe

315
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
we'd like to take cells from your windpipe.

316
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
If you present with a diseased pancreas

317
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
we'd like to take cells from that organ.

318
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Why? Because we'd rather take those cells

319
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
which already know that those are the cell types you want.

320
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
A windpipe cell already knows it's a windpipe cell.

321
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
We don't need to teach it to become another cell type.

322
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
So, we prefer organ-specific cells.

323
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body,

324
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
except for several which we still need stem cells for,

325
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
like heart, liver, nerve and pancreas.

326
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And for those we still need stem cells.

327
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
If we cannot use stem cells from your body

328
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
then we'd like to use donor stem cells.

329
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And we prefer cells that will not reject

330
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and will not form tumors.

331
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
And we're working a lot with the stem cells that we

332
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
published on two years ago,

333
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
stem cells from the amniotic fluid,

334
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and the placenta, which have those properties.

335
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
So, at this point, I do want to tell you that

336
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
some of the major challenges we have.

337
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
You know, I just showed you this presentation, everything looks so good,

338
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
everything works. Actually no,

339
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
these technologies really are not that easy.

340
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Some of the work you saw today

341
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
was performed by over 700 researchers

342
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
at our institute across a 20-year time span.

343
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
So, these are very tough technologies.

344
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Once you get the formula right you can replicate it.

345
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
But it takes a lot to get there.

346
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
So, I always like to show this cartoon.

347
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
This is how to stop a runaway stage.

348
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And there you see the stagecoach driver,

349
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and he goes, on the top panel,

350
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
He goes A, B, C, D, E, F.

351
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
He finally stops the runaway stage.

352
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And those are usually the basic scientists,

353
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
The bottom is usually the surgeons.

354
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
(Laughter)

355
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
I'm a surgeon so that's not that funny.

356
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
(Laughter)

357
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
But actually method A is the correct approach.

358
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And what I mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies

359
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
to the clinic,

360
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
we've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can

361
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
in the laboratory before we ever

362
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
launch these technologies to patients.

363
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
And when we launch these technologies to patients

364
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question.

365
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Are you ready to place this in your own loved one, your own child,

366
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
your own family member, and then we proceed.

367
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Because our main goal, of course,

368
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
is first, to do no harm.

369
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
I'm going to show you now, a very short clip,

370
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
It's a five second clip of a patient

371
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
who received one of the engineered organs.

372
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
We started implanting some of these structures

373
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
over 14 years ago.

374
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
So, we have patients now walking around with organs,

375
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
engineered organs, for over 10 years, as well.

376
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
I'm going to show a clip of one young lady.

377
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
She had a spina bifida defect, a spinal cord abnormality.

378
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
She did not have a normal bladder. This is a segment from CNN.

379
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
We are just taking five seconds.

380
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
This is a segment that Sanjay Gupta actually took care of.

381
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Video: Kaitlyn M: I'm happy. I was always afraid

382
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
that I was going to have like, an accident or something.

383
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
And now I can just go and

384
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
go out with my friends,

385
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
go do whatever I want.

386
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Anthony Atala: See, at the end of the day, the promise of regenerative medicine

387
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
is a single promise.

388
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
And that is really very simple,

389
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
to make our patients better.

390
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Thank you for your attention.

391
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So, I've known a lot of fish in my life.

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I've loved only two.

3
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
That first one,

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
it was more like a passionate affair.

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It was a beautiful fish:

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
flavorful, textured, meaty,

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
a bestseller on the menu.

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
What a fish.

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Even better,

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
of sustainability.

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So you could feel good about selling it.

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I was in a relationship with this beauty

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
for several months.

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
One day, the head of the company called

17
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and asked if I'd speak at an event

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
about the farm's sustainability.

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
"Absolutely," I said.

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Here was a company trying to solve

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
what's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs:

22
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
How do we keep fish on our menus?

23
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
For the past 50 years,

24
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
we've been fishing the seas

25
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
like we clear-cut forests.

26
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It's hard to overstate the destruction.

27
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Ninety percent of large fish, the ones we love --

28
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
the tunas, the halibuts, the salmons, swordfish --

29
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
they've collapsed.

30
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
There's almost nothing left.

31
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So, for better or for worse,

32
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
aquaculture, fish farming, is going to be a part of our future.

33
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
A lot of arguments against it:

34
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway --

35
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and they're inefficient. Take tuna,

36
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
a major drawback.

37
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It's got a feed conversion ratio

38
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
of 15 to one.

39
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish

40
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to get you one pound of farm tuna.

41
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Not very sustainable.

42
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
It doesn't taste very good either.

43
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So here, finally,

44
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
was a company trying to do it right.

45
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I wanted to support them.

46
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The day before the event,

47
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I called the head of P.R. for the company.

48
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Let's call him Don.

49
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
"Don," I said, "just to get the facts straight, you guys are famous

50
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
for farming so far out to sea, you don't pollute."

51
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
"That's right," he said. "We're so far out,

52
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
the waste from our fish gets distributed,

53
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
not concentrated."

54
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And then he added,

55
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
"We're basically a world unto ourselves.

56
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
That feed conversion ratio? 2.5 to one," he said.

57
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
"Best in the business."

58
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
2.5 to one, great.

59
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
"2.5 what? What are you feeding?"

60
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
"Sustainable proteins," he said.

61
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
"Great," I said. Got off the phone.

62
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And that night, I was lying in bed, and I thought:

63
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
What the hell is a sustainable protein?

64
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So the next day, just before the event, I called Don.

66
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I said, "Don, what are some examples of sustainable proteins?"

67
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
He said he didn't know. He would ask around.

68
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Well, I got on the phone with a few people in the company;

69
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
no one could give me a straight answer

70
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
until finally, I got on the phone

71
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
with the head biologist.

72
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Let's call him Don too.

73
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
"Don," I said,

75
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
"what are some examples of sustainable proteins?"

76
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Well, he mentioned some algaes

77
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and some fish meals,

78
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and then he said chicken pellets.

79
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I said, "Chicken pellets?"

80
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
He said, "Yeah, feathers, skin,

81
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
bone meal, scraps,

82
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
dried and processed into feed."

83
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I said, "What percentage

84
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
of your feed is chicken?"

85
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Thinking, you know, two percent.

86
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
"Well, it's about 30 percent," he said.

87
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I said, "Don, what's sustainable

88
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
about feeding chicken to fish?"

89
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
There was a long pause on the line,

91
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and he said, "There's just too much chicken in the world."

92
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I fell out of love with this fish.

94
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
No, not because I'm some self-righteous,

96
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
goody-two shoes foodie.

97
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I actually am.

98
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
No, I actually fell out of love with this fish because, I swear to God,

100
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
after that conversation, the fish tasted like chicken.

101
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
This second fish,

103
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
it's a different kind of love story.

104
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
It's the romantic kind,

105
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
the kind where the more you get to know your fish,

106
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
you love the fish.

107
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I first ate it at a restaurant

108
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
in southern Spain.

109
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time.

110
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
She kind of set us up.

111
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Laughter)

112
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
It came to the table

113
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
a bright, almost shimmering, white color.

114
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
The chef had overcooked it.

115
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Like twice over.

116
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Amazingly, it was still delicious.

117
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Who can make a fish taste good

118
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
after it's been overcooked?

119
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I can't,

120
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
but this guy can.

121
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Let's call him Miguel --

122
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
actually his name is Miguel.

123
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
(Laughter)

124
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And no, he didn't cook the fish, and he's not a chef,

125
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
at least in the way that you and I understand it.

126
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
He's a biologist

127
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
at Veta La Palma.

128
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
It's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain.

129
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river.

130
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Until the 1980s,

131
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians.

132
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
They raised beef cattle

133
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
on what was essentially wetlands.

134
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
They did it by draining the land.

135
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
They built this intricate series of canals,

136
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and they pushed water off the land and out into the river.

137
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Well, they couldn't make it work,

138
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
not economically.

139
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And ecologically, it was a disaster.

140
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It killed like 90 percent of the birds,

141
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
which, for this place, is a lot of birds.

142
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And so in 1982,

143
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
a Spanish company with an environmental conscience

144
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
purchased the land.

145
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
What did they do?

146
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
They reversed the flow of water.

147
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
They literally flipped the switch.

148
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Instead of pushing water out,

149
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
they used the channels to pull water back in.

150
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
They flooded the canals.

151
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
They created a 27,000-acre fish farm --

152
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
bass, mullet,

153
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
shrimp, eel --

154
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and in the process, Miguel and this company

155
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
completely reversed the ecological destruction.

156
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
The farm's incredible.

157
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I mean, you've never seen anything like this.

158
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
You stare out at a horizon

159
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that is a million miles away,

160
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and all you see are flooded canals

161
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and this thick, rich marshland.

162
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I was there not long ago with Miguel.

163
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
He's an amazing guy,

164
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee.

165
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Laughter)

166
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Okay? There we are slogging through the wetlands,

167
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and I'm panting and sweating, got mud up to my knees,

168
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology lecture.

169
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Here, he's pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite.

170
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Now, he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton.

171
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And here, here he sees a grouping pattern

172
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe.

173
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It turns out, Miguel spent the better part of his career

174
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
in the Mikumi National Park in Africa.

175
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I asked him how he became

176
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
such an expert on fish.

177
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
He said, "Fish? I didn't know anything about fish.

178
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I'm an expert in relationships."

179
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And then he's off, launching into more talk

180
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
about rare birds and algaes

181
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and strange aquatic plants.

182
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And don't get me wrong, that was really fascinating, you know,

183
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
the biotic community unplugged, kind of thing.

184
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It's great, but I was in love.

185
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And my head was swooning over that

186
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before.

187
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So I interrupted him. I said,

188
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
"Miguel, what makes your fish taste so good?"

189
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
He pointed at the algae.

190
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
"I know, dude, the algae, the phytoplankton,

191
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
the relationships: It's amazing.

192
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
But what are your fish eating?

193
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
What's the feed conversion ratio?"

194
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Well, he goes on to tell me

195
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
it's such a rich system

196
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild.

197
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
The plant biomass, the phytoplankton,

198
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
the zooplankton, it's what feeds the fish.

199
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
The system is so healthy,

200
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
it's totally self-renewing.

201
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
There is no feed.

202
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals?

203
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Later that day, I was driving around this property with Miguel,

204
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and I asked him, I said, "For a place that seems so natural,

205
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
unlike like any farm I'd ever been at,

206
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
how do you measure success?"

207
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
At that moment, it was as if

208
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
a film director called for a set change.

209
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And we rounded the corner

210
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and saw the most amazing sight:

211
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
thousands and thousands of pink flamingos,

212
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see.

213
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
"That's success," he said.

214
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
"Look at their bellies, pink.

215
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
They're feasting."

216
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Feasting? I was totally confused.

217
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I said, "Miguel, aren't they feasting on your fish?"

218
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Laughter)

219
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
"Yes," he said.

220
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
(Laughter)

221
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
"We lose 20 percent of our fish

222
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and fish eggs to birds.

223
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Well, last year, this property

224
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
had 600,000 birds on it,

225
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
more than 250 different species.

226
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It's become, today, the largest

227
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and one of the most important

228
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe."

229
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I said, "Miguel, isn't a thriving bird population

230
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
like the last thing you want on a fish farm?"

231
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
(Laughter)

232
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
He shook his head, no.

233
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
He said, "We farm extensively,

234
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
not intensively.

235
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
This is an ecological network.

236
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
The flamingos eat the shrimp.

237
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton.

238
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So the pinker the belly,

239
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
the better the system."

240
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Okay, so let's review:

241
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
a farm that doesn't feed its animals,

242
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and a farm that measures its success

243
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
on the health of its predators.

244
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
A fish farm, but also a bird sanctuary.

245
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Oh, and by the way, those flamingos,

246
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
they shouldn't even be there in the first place.

247
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
They brood in a town

248
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
150 miles away,

249
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
where the soil conditions

250
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
are better for building nests.

251
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Every morning, they fly

252
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
150 miles into the farm.

253
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And every evening, they fly 150 miles back.

254
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Laughter)

255
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
They do that because they're able to follow

256
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
the broken white line

257
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
of highway A92.

258
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
(Laughter)

259
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
No kidding.

260
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I was imagining a "March of the Penguins" thing,

261
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
so I looked at Miguel.

262
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I said, "Miguel, do they fly

263
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
150 miles to the farm,

264
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and then do they fly

265
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
150 miles back at night?

266
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Do they do that for the children?"

267
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song.

268
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
(Laughter)

269
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
He said, "No; they do it because the food's better."

270
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
(Laughter)

271
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish,

272
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
which was delicious -- and I don't like fish skin;

273
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
I don't like it seared, I don't like it crispy.

274
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
It's that acrid, tar-like flavor.

275
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
I almost never cook with it.

276
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Yet, when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain,

277
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
it tasted not at all like fish skin.

278
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It tasted sweet and clean,

279
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
like you were taking a bite of the ocean.

280
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I mentioned that to Miguel, and he nodded.

281
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
He said, "The skin acts like a sponge.

282
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
It's the last defense before anything enters the body.

283
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
It evolved to soak up impurities."

284
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And then he added,

285
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
"But our water has no impurities."

286
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
OK. A farm that doesn't feed its fish,

287
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
a farm that measures its success

288
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
by the success of its predators.

289
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And then I realized when he says,

290
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
"A farm that has no impurities,"

291
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
he made a big understatement,

292
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
because the water that flows through that farm

293
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
comes in from the Guadalquivir River.

294
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
It's a river that carries with it

295
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
all the things that rivers tend to carry these days:

296
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
chemical contaminants,

297
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
pesticide runoff.

298
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And when it works its way through the system

299
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and leaves,

300
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
the water is cleaner than when it entered.

301
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
The system is so healthy, it purifies the water.

302
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
So, not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals,

303
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
not just a farm that measures its success

304
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
by the health of its predators,

305
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
but a farm that's literally a water purification plant --

306
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and not just for those fish,

307
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
but for you and me as well.

308
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Because when that water leaves, it dumps out into the Atlantic.

309
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
A drop in the ocean, I know,

310
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
but I'll take it, and so should you,

311
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
because this love story,

312
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
however romantic,

313
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
is also instructive.

314
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
You might say it's a recipe

315
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
for the future of good food,

316
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle.

317
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
What we need now is

318
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
a radically new conception of agriculture,

319
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
one in which the food actually tastes good.

320
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
(Laughter)

321
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
(Applause)

322
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
But for a lot people,

323
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
that's a bit too radical.

324
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
We're not realists, us foodies;

325
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
we're lovers.

326
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
We love farmers' markets,

327
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
we love small family farms,

328
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
we talk about local food,

329
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
we eat organic.

330
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And when you suggest these are the things

331
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
that will ensure the future of good food,

332
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
someone, somewhere stands up and says,

333
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
"Hey guy, I love pink flamingos,

334
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
but how are you going to feed the world?"

335
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
How are you going to feed the world?

336
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Can I be honest?

337
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
I don't love that question.

338
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
No, not because we already produce

339
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
enough calories to more than feed the world.

340
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
One billion people will go hungry today.

341
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
One billion -- that's more than ever before --

342
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
because of gross inequalities in distribution,

343
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
not tonnage.

344
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Now, I don't love this question because it's determined the logic

345
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
of our food system for the last 50 years.

346
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Feed grain to herbivores,

347
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
pesticides to monocultures, chemicals to soil,

348
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
chicken to fish,

349
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and all along agribusiness

350
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
has simply asked,

351
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
"If we're feeding more people more cheaply,

352
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
how terrible could that be?"

353
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
That's been the motivation,

354
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
it's been the justification:

355
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
it's been the business plan

356
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
of American agriculture.

357
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
We should call it what it is:

358
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
a business in liquidation,

359
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
a business that's quickly eroding

360
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
ecological capital that makes that very production possible.

361
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
That's not a business,

362
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and it isn't agriculture.

363
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Our breadbasket is threatened today,

364
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
not because of diminishing supply,

365
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
but because of diminishing resources.

366
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
Not by the latest combine and tractor invention,

367
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
but by fertile land;

368
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
not by pumps, but by fresh water;

369
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
not by chainsaws, but by forests;

370
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
and not by fishing boats and nets, but by fish in the sea.

371
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Want to feed the world?

372
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Let's start by asking: How are we going to feed ourselves?

373
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Or better: How can we create conditions

374
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
that enable every community

375
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
to feed itself?

376
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
(Applause)

377
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
To do that,

378
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
don't look at the agribusiness model for the future.

379
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
It's really old, and it's tired.

380
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
It's high on capital, chemistry and machines,

381
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
and it's never produced anything really good to eat.

382
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Instead, let's look to the ecological model.

383
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
That's the one that relies on two billion years

384
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
of on-the-job experience.

385
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
Look to Miguel,

386
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
farmers like Miguel.

387
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves;

388
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
farms that restore instead of deplete;

389
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
farms that farm extensively

390
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
instead of just intensively;

391
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
farmers that are not just producers,

392
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
but experts in relationships.

393
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
Because they're the ones

394
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
that are experts in flavor, too.

395
0:18:24.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
And if I'm going to be really honest,

396
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
they're a better chef than I'll ever be.

397
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
You know, I'm okay with that,

398
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be delicious.

399
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
Thank you.

400
0:18:37.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
(Applause)

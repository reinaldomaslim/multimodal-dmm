1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to presenting great American lives,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
amazing people.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And that's what it's about.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
We use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives, but that's it.

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And so I'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I'm going to talk about a program I started there,

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
which, from my point of view, is the proudest thing I did.

9
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I started to worry about the fact

10
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore,

11
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and they're amazing people,

12
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and we want to deliver them to future generations.

13
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So, how do we do that?

14
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series.

15
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically

16
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
my being a brush in the hand

17
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
of amazing people who would come and I would interview.

18
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And so what I'm going to do is, not so much give you

19
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the great hits of that program,

20
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
as to give you this whole notion

21
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
of how you encounter people in that kind of situation,

22
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
what you try to find out about them,

23
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and when people deliver and when they don't and why.

24
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Now, I had two preconditions.

25
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
One was that they be American.

26
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
That's just because, in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery,

27
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
it's created to look at American lives.

28
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
That was easy, but then I made the decision,

29
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
maybe arbitrary,

30
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that they needed to be people of a certain age,

31
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
which at that point, when I created this program,

32
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
seemed really old.

33
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties.

34
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
For obvious reasons, it doesn't seem that old anymore to me.

35
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And why did I do that?

36
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Well, for one thing, we're a youth-obsessed culture.

37
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
And I thought really what we need is an elders program

38
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk.

39
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But the second part of it -- and the older I get,

40
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the more convinced I am that that's true.

41
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's amazing what people will say when they know

42
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
how the story turned out.

43
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
That's the one advantage that older people have.

44
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Well, they have other, little bit of advantage,

45
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but they also have some disadvantages,

46
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but the one thing they or we have is that

47
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
we've reached the point in life

48
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
where we know how the story turned out.

49
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So, we can then go back in our lives,

50
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
if we've got an interviewer who gets that,

51
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and begin to reflect on how we got there.

52
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
All of those accidents that wound up

53
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
creating the life narrative that we inherited.

54
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So, I thought okay, now,

55
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
what is it going to take to make this work?

56
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
There are many kinds of interviews. We know them.

57
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
There are the journalist interviews,

58
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
which are the interrogation that is expected.

59
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
This is somewhat against resistance

60
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and caginess on the part of the interviewee.

61
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Then there's the celebrity interview,

62
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
where it's more important who's asking the question than who answers.

63
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
That's Barbara Walters and others like that, and we like that.

64
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
That's Frost-Nixon, where Frost seems to be as important

65
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
as Nixon in that process.

66
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Fair enough.

67
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But I wanted interviews that were different.

68
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I wanted to be, as I later thought of it, empathic,

69
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
which is to say, to feel what they wanted to say

70
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and to be an agent of their self-revelation.

71
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
By the way, this was always done in public.

72
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
This was not an oral history program.

73
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
This was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual,

74
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and having me be the brush in their self-portrait.

75
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Now, it turns out that I was pretty good at that.

76
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I didn't know it coming into it.

77
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And the only reason I really know that

78
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
is because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright,

79
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and that was six months after he'd had a stroke.

80
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And he had never appeared in public since that point.

81
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
This was not a devastating stroke,

82
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
but it did affect his speaking and so forth.

83
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And I thought it was worth a chance,

84
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
he thought it was worth a chance,

85
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and so we got up on the stage,

86
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and we had an hour conversation about his life,

87
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and after that a woman rushed up to me,

88
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
essentially did,

89
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and she said, "Where did you train as a doctor?"

90
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And I said, "I have no training as a doctor. I never claimed that."

91
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And she said, "Well, something very weird was happening.

92
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
When he started a sentence, particularly

93
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
in the early parts of the interview,

94
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and paused, you gave him the word,

95
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
the bridge to get to the end of the sentence,

96
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and by the end of it,

97
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
he was speaking complete sentences on his own."

98
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I didn't know what was going on,

99
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
but I was so part of the process of getting that out.

100
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So I thought, okay, fine, I've got empathy,

101
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
or empathy, at any rate,

102
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
is what's critical to this kind of interview.

103
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But then I began to think of other things.

104
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Who makes a great interview in this context?

105
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
It had nothing to do with their intellect,

106
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
the quality of their intellect.

107
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Some of them were very brilliant,

108
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
some of them were,

109
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
you know, ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals,

110
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
but it was never about that.

111
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It was about their energy.

112
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It's energy that creates extraordinary interviews

113
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and extraordinary lives.

114
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I'm convinced of it.

115
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And it had nothing to do with the energy of being young.

116
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
These were people through their 90s.

117
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
In fact, the first person I interviewed

118
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
was George Abbott, who was 97,

119
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and Abbott was filled with the life force --

120
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I guess that's the way I think about it -- filled with it.

121
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And so he filled the room,

122
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and we had an extraordinary conversation.

123
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
He was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do

124
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
because he was famous for being silent,

125
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
for never ever saying anything

126
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
except maybe a word or two.

127
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And, in fact, he did wind up opening up --

128
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
by the way, his energy is evidenced in other ways.

129
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
He subsequently got married again at 102,

130
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
so he, you know, he had a lot of the life force in him.

131
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But after the interview, I got a call,

132
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
very gruff voice, from a woman.

133
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I didn't know who she was,

134
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and she said, "Did you get George Abbott to talk?"

135
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And I said, "Yeah. Apparently I did."

136
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And she said, "I'm his old girlfriend, Maureen Stapleton,

137
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and I could never do it."

138
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And then she made me go up with the tape of it

139
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and prove that George Abbott actually could talk.

140
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So, you know, you want energy,

141
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
you want the life force,

142
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
but you really want them also to think

143
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that they have a story worth sharing.

144
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
The worst interviews that you can ever have

145
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
are with people who are modest.

146
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Never ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest,

147
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
because all of these people have been assembled

148
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to listen to them, and they sit there and they say,

149
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
"Aw, shucks, it was an accident."

150
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
There's nothing that ever happens that justifies

151
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
people taking good hours of the day to be with them.

152
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
The worst interview I ever did: William L. Shirer.

153
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The journalist who did "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich."

154
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
This guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months,

155
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and every time I'd ask him about it, he'd say, "Oh, I just happened to be there.

156
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Didn't matter." Whatever.

157
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Awful.

158
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I never would ever agree to interview a modest person.

159
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
They have to think that they did something

160
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and that they want to share it with you.

161
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But it comes down, in the end,

162
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
to how do you get through all the barriers we have.

163
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
All of us are public and private beings,

164
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and if all you're going to get from the interviewee is their public self,

165
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
there's no point in it.

166
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It's pre-programmed. It's infomercial,

167
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and we all have infomercials about our lives.

168
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
We know the great lines, we know the great moments,

169
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
we know what we're not going to share,

170
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody.

171
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
This wasn't -- and some of you will remember

172
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Mike Wallace's old interviews --

173
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
tough, aggressive and so forth. They have their place.

174
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say,

175
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
to break out of their own cocoon of the public self,

176
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and the more public they had been,

177
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
the more entrenched that person, that outer person was.

178
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment

179
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that happened in this interview series.

180
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It all has to do with that shell that most of us have,

181
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and particularly certain people.

182
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
There's an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce.

183
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
It'll be your generational determinant

184
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
as to whether her name means much to you.

185
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
She did so much. She was a playwright.

186
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
She did an extraordinary play called "The Women."

187
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
She was a congresswoman

188
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
when there weren't very many congresswomen.

189
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
She was editor of Vanity Fair,

190
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
one of the great phenomenal women of her day.

191
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And, incidentally, I call her

192
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the Eleanor Roosevelt of the Right.

193
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
She was sort of adored on the Right

194
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
the way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left.

195
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And, in fact, when we did the interview --

196
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I did the living self-portrait with her --

197
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
there were three former directors of the CIA

198
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
basically sitting at her feet,

199
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
just enjoying her presence.

200
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And I thought, this is going to be a piece of cake,

201
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
because I always have preliminary talks with these people

202
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
for just maybe 10 or 15 minutes.

203
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
We never talk before that because if you talk before,

204
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
you don't get it on the stage.

205
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So she and I had a delightful conversation.

206
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We were on the stage and then --

207
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
by the way, spectacular.

208
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It was all part of Clare Boothe Luce's look.

209
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
She was in a great evening gown.

210
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
She was 80, almost that day of the interview,

211
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and there she was and there I was,

212
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and I just proceeded into the questions.

213
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And she stonewalled me. It was unbelievable.

214
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Anything that I would ask, she would turn around, dismiss,

215
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and I was basically up there -- any of you

216
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
in the moderate-to-full entertainment world

217
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
know what it is to die onstage.

218
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And I was dying. She was absolutely not giving me a thing.

219
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And I began to wonder what was going on,

220
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and you think while you talk,

221
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
and basically, I thought, I got it.

222
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
When we were alone, I was her audience.

223
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Now I'm her competitor for the audience.

224
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
That's the problem here, and she's fighting me for that,

225
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and so then I asked her a question --

226
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I didn't know how I was going to get out of it --

227
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
I asked her a question about her days as a playwright,

228
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and again, characteristically,

229
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
instead of saying, "Oh yes, I was a playwright, and this is what blah blah blah,"

230
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
she said, "Oh, playwright. Everybody knows I was a playwright.

231
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Most people think that I was an actress. I was never an actress."

232
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
But I hadn't asked that, and then she went off on a tear,

233
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and she said, "Oh, well, there was that one time that I was an actress.

234
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
It was for a charity in Connecticut when I was a congresswoman,

235
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and I got up there," and she went on and on, "And then I got on the stage."

236
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And then she turned to me and said,

237
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
"And you know what those young actors did?

238
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
They upstaged me." And she said, "Do you know what that is?"

239
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Just withering in her contempt.

240
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And I said, "I'm learning."

241
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
(Laughter)

242
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And she looked at me, and it was like the successful arm-wrestle,

243
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and then, after that, she delivered an extraordinary account

244
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
of what her life really was like.

245
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I have to end that one. This is my tribute to Clare Boothe Luce.

246
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Again, a remarkable person.

247
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I'm not politically attracted to her, but through her life force,

248
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I'm attracted to her.

249
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And the way she died -- she had, toward the end, a brain tumor.

250
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
That's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine,

251
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and very few of us were invited to a dinner party.

252
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And she was in horrible pain.

253
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
We all knew that.

254
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
She stayed in her room.

255
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Everybody came. The butler passed around canapes.

256
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
The usual sort of thing.

257
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Then at a certain moment, the door opened

258
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and she walked out perfectly dressed, completely composed.

259
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
The public self, the beauty, the intellect,

260
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and she walked around and talked to every person there

261
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and then went back into the room and was never seen again.

262
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
She wanted the control of her final moment, and she did it amazingly.

263
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Now, there are other ways that you get somebody to open up,

264
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and this is just a brief reference.

265
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
It wasn't this arm-wrestle,

266
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
but it was a little surprising for the person involved.

267
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
I interviewed Steve Martin. It wasn't all that long ago.

268
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And we were sitting there,

269
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and almost toward the beginning of the interview,

270
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I turned to him and I said, "Steve," or "Mr. Martin,

271
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
it is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods.

272
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Was yours unhappy?"

273
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And he looked at me, you know, as if to say,

274
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
"This is how you're going to start this thing, right off?"

275
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And then he turned to me, not stupidly,

276
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and he said, "What was your childhood like?"

277
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And I said -- these are all arm wrestles, but they're affectionate --

278
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and I said, "My father was loving and supportive,

279
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
which is why I'm not funny."

280
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
(Laughter)

281
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And he looked at me, and then we heard the big sad story.

282
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
His father was an SOB,

283
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and, in fact, he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood,

284
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
but then we were off and running.

285
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
So the question is:

286
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
What is the key that's going to allow this to proceed?

287
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Now, these are arm wrestle questions,

288
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
but I want to tell you about questions

289
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that are more related to empathy

290
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and that really, very often, are the questions

291
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
that people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked.

292
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And I'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints.

293
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
One was an interview I did with one of the great American biographers.

294
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Again, some of you will know him, most of you won't, Dumas Malone.

295
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
He did a five-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson,

296
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
spent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson,

297
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
and by the way, at one point I asked him,

298
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
"Would you like to have met him?"

299
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And he said, "Well, of course,

300
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
but actually, I know him better than anyone who ever met him,

301
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
because I got to read all of his letters."

302
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
So, he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over 50 years.

303
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And I asked him one question.

304
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
I said, "Did Jefferson ever disappoint you?"

305
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson

306
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and connecting with him,

307
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and he said, "Well ..." -- I'm going to do a bad southern accent.

308
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Dumas Malone was from Mississippi originally.

309
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
But he said, "Well," he said, "I'm afraid so."

310
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
He said, "You know, I've read everything,

311
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit."

312
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And he basically was saying that this was a man

313
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
who lied more than he wished he had,

314
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
because he saw the letters.

315
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
He said, "But I understand that." He said, "I understand that."

316
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
He said, "We southerners do like a smooth surface,

317
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
so that there were times when he just didn't want the confrontation."

318
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And he said, "Now, John Adams was too honest."

319
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And he started to talk about that, and later on he invited me to his house,

320
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and I met his wife who was from Massachusetts,

321
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and he and she had exactly the relationship

322
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.

323
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
She was the New Englander and abrasive,

324
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and he was this courtly fellow.

325
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
But really the most important question I ever asked,

326
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and most of the times when I talk about it,

327
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity, or cruelty,

328
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
but I promise you it was the right question.

329
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
This was to Agnes de Mille.

330
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Agnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history.

331
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
She basically created the dances in "Oklahoma,"

332
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
transforming the American theater.

333
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
An amazing woman.

334
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
At the time that I proposed to her that --

335
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
by the way, I would have proposed to her; she was extraordinary --

336
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
but proposed to her that she come on.

337
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
She said, "Come to my apartment."

338
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
She lived in New York.

339
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
"Come to my apartment and we'll talk for those 15 minutes,

340
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
and then we'll decide whether we proceed."

341
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
And so I showed up in this dark, rambling New York apartment,

342
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
and she called out to me, and she was in bed.

343
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
I had known that she had had a stroke,

344
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and that was some 10 years before.

345
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
And so she spent almost all of her life in bed,

346
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
but -- I speak of the life force --

347
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
her hair was askew.

348
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
She wasn't about to make up for this occasion.

349
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
And she was sitting there surrounded by books,

350
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment

351
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
was her will, which she had by her side.

352
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
She wasn't unhappy about this. She was resigned.

353
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
She said, "I keep this will by my bed, memento mori,

354
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
and I change it all the time

355
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
just because I want to."

356
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
And she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life.

357
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
I thought, this is somebody I've got to get in this series.

358
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
She agreed.

359
0:18:24.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
She came on. Of course she was wheelchaired on.

360
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
Half of her body was stricken, the other half not.

361
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
She was, of course, done up for the occasion,

362
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
but this was a woman in great physical distress.

363
0:18:37.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
And we had a conversation,

364
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
and then I asked her this unthinkable question.

365
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
I said, "Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful?"

366
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
And the audience just -- you know,

367
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
they're always on the side of the interviewee,

368
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
and they felt that this was a kind of assault,

369
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:03,000
but this was the question she had

370
0:19:03.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
wanted somebody to ask her whole life.

371
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:11,000
And she began to talk about her childhood, when she was beautiful,

372
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:14,000
and she literally turned -- here she was, in this broken body --

373
0:19:14.26,000 --> 0:19:17,000
and she turned to the audience and

374
0:19:17.26,000 --> 0:19:19,000
described herself as the fair demoiselle

375
0:19:19.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
with her red hair and her light steps and so forth,

376
0:19:25.26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
and then she said, "And then puberty hit."

377
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
And she began to talk about things that had happened

378
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:32,000
to her body and her face,

379
0:19:32.26,000 --> 0:19:36,000
and how she could no longer count on her beauty,

380
0:19:36.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one

381
0:19:43.26,000 --> 0:19:45,000
for whom all the ballet lessons were given.

382
0:19:45.26,000 --> 0:19:5,000
And she had to go along just to be with her sister for company,

383
0:19:50.26,000 --> 0:19:53,000
and in that process, she made a number of decisions.

384
0:19:53.26,000 --> 0:19:55,000
First of all, was that dance, even though

385
0:19:55.26,000 --> 0:19:57,000
it hadn't been offered to her, was her life.

386
0:19:57.26,000 --> 0:19:59,000
And secondly, she had better be,

387
0:19:59.26,000 --> 0:20:01,000
although she did dance for a while, a choreographer

388
0:20:01.26,000 --> 0:20:04,000
because then her looks didn't matter.

389
0:20:04.26,000 --> 0:20:11,000
But she was thrilled to get that out as a real, real fact in her life.

390
0:20:11.26,000 --> 0:20:16,000
It was an amazing privilege to do this series.

391
0:20:16.26,000 --> 0:20:22,000
There were other moments like that, very few moments of silence.

392
0:20:22.26,000 --> 0:20:25,000
The key point was empathy

393
0:20:25.26,000 --> 0:20:29,000
because everybody in their lives

394
0:20:29.26,000 --> 0:20:33,000
is really waiting for people to ask them questions,

395
0:20:33.26,000 --> 0:20:35,000
so that they can be truthful about who they are

396
0:20:35.26,000 --> 0:20:38,000
and how they became what they are,

397
0:20:38.26,000 --> 0:20:42,000
and I commend that to you, even if you're not doing interviews.

398
0:20:42.26,000 --> 0:20:44,000
Just be that way with your friends

399
0:20:44.26,000 --> 0:20:47,000
and particularly the older members of your family.

400
0:20:47.26,000 --> 0:20:49,000
Thank you very much.

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The question today is not:

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Why did we invade Afghanistan?

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
The question is:

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
why are we still in Afghanistan

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
one decade later?

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Why are we spending

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
$135 billion?

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground?

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Why were more people killed

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
last month

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
than in any preceding month

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
of this conflict?

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
How has this happened?

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The last 20 years

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
has been the age of intervention,

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and Afghanistan is simply one act

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
in a five-act tragedy.

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We came out of the end of the Cold War

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in despair.

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We faced Rwanda;

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
we faced Bosnia,

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and then we rediscovered our confidence.

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
In the third act, we went into Bosnia and Kosovo

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and we seemed to succeed.

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
In the fourth act, with our hubris,

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
our overconfidence developing,

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan,

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and in the fifth act,

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
we plunged into a humiliating mess.

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So the question is: What are we doing?

31
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Why are we still stuck in Afghanistan?

32
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And the answer, of course,

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that we keep being given

34
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
is as follows:

35
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
we're told that we went into Afghanistan

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
because of 9/11,

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and that we remain there

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
because the Taliban poses an existential threat

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to global security.

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
In the words of President Obama,

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
"If the Taliban take over again,

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
they will invite back Al-Qaeda,

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
who will try to kill as many of our people

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
as they possibly can."

45
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The story that we're told

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
is that there was a "light footprint" initially --

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
in other words, that we ended up in a situation

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
where we didn't have enough troops,

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
we didn't have enough resources,

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that Afghans were frustrated --

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
they felt there wasn't enough progress

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and economic development and security,

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and therefore the Taliban came back --

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that we responded in 2005 and 2006

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
with troop deployments,

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but we still didn't put enough troops on the ground.

57
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And that it wasn't until 2009,

58
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
when President Obama signed off on a surge,

59
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that we finally had,

60
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
in the words of Secretary Clinton,

61
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
"the strategy, the leadership and the resources."

62
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So, as the president now reassures us,

63
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
we are on track to achieve our goals.

64
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
All of this is wrong.

65
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
Every one of those statements is wrong.

66
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Afghanistan does not

67
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
pose an existential threat

68
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to global security.

69
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It is extremely unlikely

70
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the Taliban would ever be able to take over the country --

71
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
extremely unlikely they'd be able to seize Kabul.

72
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
They simply don't have a conventional military option.

73
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And even if they were able to do so, even if I'm wrong,

74
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
it's extremely unlikely

75
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
the Taliban would invite back Al-Qaeda.

76
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
From the Taliban's point of view,

77
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that was their number one mistake last time.

78
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
If they hadn't invited back Al-Qaeda,

79
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
they would still be in power today.

80
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And even if I'm wrong about those two things,

81
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
even if they were able to take back the country,

82
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
even if they were to invite back Al-Qaeda,

83
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
it's extremely unlikely

84
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that Al-Qaeda would significantly enhance

85
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
its ability to harm the United States

86
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
or harm Europe.

87
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Because this isn't the 1990s anymore.

88
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
If the Al-Qaeda base

89
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
was to be established near Ghazni,

90
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
we would hit them very hard,

91
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
and it would be very, very difficult

92
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
for the Taliban to protect them.

93
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Furthermore, it's simply not true

94
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that what went wrong in Afghanistan

95
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
is the light footprint.

96
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
In my experience, in fact,

97
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
the light footprint was extremely helpful.

98
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And these troops that we brought in --

99
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
it's a great picture of David Beckham

100
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
there on the sub-machine gun --

101
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
made the situation worse, not better.

102
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
When I walked across Afghanistan

103
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
in the winter of 2001-2002,

104
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
what I saw was scenes like this.

105
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
A girl, if you're lucky,

106
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
in the corner of a dark room --

107
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
lucky to be able to look at the Koran.

108
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But in those early days

109
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
when we're told we didn't have enough troops and enough resources,

110
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
we made a lot of progress in Afghanistan.

111
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Within a few months,

112
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
there were two and a half million more girls in school.

113
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
In Sangin where I was sick in 2002,

114
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
the nearest health clinic

115
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
was within three days walk.

116
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Today, there are 14 health clinics

117
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
in that area alone.

118
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
There was amazing improvements.

119
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We went from almost no Afghans

120
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
having mobile telephones during the Taliban

121
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
to a situation where, almost overnight,

122
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
three million Afghans had mobile telephones.

123
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And we had progress in the free media.

124
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We had progress in elections --

125
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
all of this with the so-called light footprint.

126
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But when we began to bring more money,

127
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
when we began to invest more resources,

128
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
things got worse, not better. How?

129
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Well first see, if you put 125 billion dollars a year

130
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
into a country like Afghanistan

131
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
where the entire revenue of the Afghan state

132
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
is one billion dollars a year,

133
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
you drown everything.

134
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It's not simply corruption and waste

135
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that you create;

136
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
you essentially replace the priorities of the Afghan government,

137
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
the elected Afghan government,

138
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
with the micromanaging tendencies

139
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
of foreigners on short tours

140
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
with their own priorities.

141
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And the same is true for the troops.

142
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
When I walked across Afghanistan,

143
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I stayed with people like this.

144
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
This is Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj.

145
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj was a great host.

146
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
He was very generous,

147
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
like many of the Afghans I stayed with.

148
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
But he was also considerably more conservative,

149
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
considerably more anti-foreign,

150
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
considerably more Islamist

151
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
than we'd like to acknowledge.

152
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
This man, for example, Mullah Mustafa,

153
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
tried to shoot me.

154
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And the reason I'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph

155
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
is I was somewhat frightened,

156
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and I was too afraid on this occasion

157
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
to ask him, having run for an hour through the desert

158
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and taken refuge in this house,

159
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me.

160
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But 18 months later, I asked him

161
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
why he had tried to shoot me.

162
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And Mullah Mustafa -- he's the man with the pen and paper --

163
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph,

164
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Nadir Shah

165
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
had bet him that he couldn't hit me.

166
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
Now this is not to say

167
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Afghanistan is a place full of people like Mullah Mustafa.

168
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
It's not; it's a wonderful place

169
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
full of incredible energy and intelligence.

170
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But it is a place

171
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
where the putting-in of the troops

172
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
has increased the violence rather than decreased it.

173
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
2005, Anthony Fitzherbert,

174
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
an agricultural engineer,

175
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
could travel through Helmand,

176
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
could stay in Nad Ali, Sangin and Ghoresh,

177
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
which are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place.

178
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Today, he could never do that.

179
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So the idea that we deployed the troops

180
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
to respond to the Taliban insurgency

181
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
is mistaken.

182
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Rather than preceding the insurgency,

183
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
the Taliban followed the troop deployment,

184
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and as far as I'm concerned,

185
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the troop deployment caused their return.

186
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Now is this a new idea?

187
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
No, there have been any number of people

188
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
saying this over the last seven years.

189
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I ran a center at Harvard

190
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
from 2008 to 2010,

191
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and there were people like Michael Semple there

192
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
who speak Afghan languages fluently,

193
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
who've traveled to almost every district in the country.

194
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Andrew Wilder, for example,

195
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
born on the Pakistan-Iranian border,

196
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
served his whole life

197
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

198
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Paul Fishstein who began working there in 1978 --

199
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
worked for Save the Children,

200
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
ran the Afghan research and evaluation unit.

201
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
These are people

202
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
who were able to say consistently

203
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
that the increase in development aid

204
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
was making Afghanistan less secure, not more secure --

205
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that the counter-insurgency strategy

206
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
was not working and would not work.

207
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And yet, nobody listened to them.

208
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Instead,

209
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
there was a litany of astonishing optimism.

210
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Beginning in 2004,

211
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
every general came in saying,

212
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
"I've inherited a dismal situation,

213
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
but finally I have the right resources and the correct strategy,

214
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
which will deliver,"

215
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
in General Barno's word in 2004,

216
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
the "decisive year."

217
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Well guess what? It didn't.

218
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But it wasn't sufficient to prevent General Abuzaid saying

219
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that he had the strategy and the resources

220
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to deliver, in 2005,

221
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
the "decisive year."

222
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Or General David Richards to come in 2006

223
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and say he had the strategy and the resources

224
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to deliver the "crunch year."

225
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Or in 2007,

226
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
the Norwegian deputy foreign minister, Espen Eide,

227
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
to say that that would deliver the "decisive year."

228
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Or in 2008, Major General Champoux

229
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
to come in and say he would deliver the "decisive year."

230
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Or in 2009, my great friend,

231
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
General Stanley McChrystal,

232
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
who said that he was "knee-deep in the decisive year."

233
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Or in 2010,

234
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
the U.K. foreign secretary, David Miliband,

235
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
who said that at last we would deliver the "decisive year."

236
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And you'll be delighted to hear in 2011, today,

237
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister,

238
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
assures us that we are in the "decisive year."

239
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Applause)

240
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
How do we allow

241
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
any of this to happen?

242
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Well the answer, of course, is,

243
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
if you spend 125 billion or 130 billion

244
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
dollars a year in a country,

245
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
you co-opt almost everybody.

246
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Even the aid agencies,

247
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
who begin to receive an enormous amount of money

248
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
from the U.S. and the European governments

249
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to build schools and clinics,

250
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
are somewhat disinclined

251
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
to challenge the idea

252
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
that Afghanistan is an existential threat

253
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
to global security.

254
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
They're worried, in other words,

255
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that if anybody believes that it wasn't such a threat --

256
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Oxfam, Save the Children

257
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
wouldn't get the money

258
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
to build their hospitals and schools.

259
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
It's also very difficult to confront a general

260
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
with medals on his chest.

261
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
It's very difficult for a politician,

262
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
because you're afraid that many lives have been lost in vain.

263
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
You feel deep, deep guilt.

264
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
You exaggerate your fears,

265
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
and you're terrified about the humiliation

266
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
of defeat.

267
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
What is the solution to this?

268
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Well the solution to this

269
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
is we need to find a way

270
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that people like Michael Semple, or those other people,

271
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
who are telling the truth, who know the country,

272
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
who've spent 30 years on the ground --

273
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and most importantly of all,

274
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
the missing component of this --

275
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Afghans themselves,

276
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
who understand what is going on.

277
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
We need to somehow get their message

278
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
to the policymakers.

279
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And this is very difficult to do

280
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
because of our structures.

281
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
The first thing we need to change

282
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
is the structures of our government.

283
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Very, very sadly,

284
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
our foreign services, the United Nations,

285
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
the military in these countries

286
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
have very little idea of what's going on.

287
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
The average British soldier is on a tour of only six months;

288
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Italian soldiers, on tours of four months;

289
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
the American military, on tours of 12 months.

290
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Diplomats are locked in embassy compounds.

291
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
When they go out, they travel in these curious armored vehicles

292
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
with these somewhat threatening security teams

293
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
who ready 24 hours in advance

294
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
who say you can only stay on the ground for an hour.

295
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
In the British embassy in Afghanistan

296
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
in 2008,

297
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
an embassy of 350 people,

298
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
there were only three people who could speak Dari,

299
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
the main language of Afghanistan, at a decent level.

300
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And there was not a single Pashto speaker.

301
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
In the Afghan section in London

302
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
responsible for governing Afghan policy on the ground,

303
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I was told last year

304
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
that there was not a single staff member

305
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
of the foreign office in that section

306
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
who had ever served

307
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
on a posting in Afghanistan.

308
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So we need to change that institutional culture.

309
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And I could make the same points about the United States

310
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and the United Nations.

311
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Secondly, we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals.

312
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
We need to make sure that we're a little bit suspicious,

313
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that we understand that optimism

314
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
is in the DNA of the military,

315
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
that we don't respond to it

316
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
with quite as much alacrity.

317
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And thirdly, we need to have some humility.

318
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
We need to begin from the position

319
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
that our knowledge, our power,

320
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
our legitimacy

321
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
is limited.

322
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
This doesn't mean

323
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that intervention around the world is a disaster.

324
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
It isn't.

325
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Bosnia and Kosovo

326
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
were signal successes,

327
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
great successes.

328
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Today when you go to Bosnia

329
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
it is almost impossible to believe

330
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that what we saw in the early 1990s happened.

331
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
It's almost impossible to believe the progress we've made

332
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
since 1994.

333
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Refugee return,

334
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
which the United Nations High Commission for Refugees

335
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
thought would be extremely unlikely,

336
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
has largely happened.

337
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
A million properties have been returned.

338
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Borders between the Bosniak territory

339
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and the Bosnian-Serb territory have calmed down.

340
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
The national army has shrunk.

341
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
The crime rates in Bosnia today

342
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
are lower than they are in Sweden.

343
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
This has been done

344
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
by an incredible, principled effort

345
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
by the international community,

346
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and, of course, above all,

347
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
by Bosnians themselves.

348
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
But you need to look at context.

349
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And this is what we've lost in Afghanistan and Iraq.

350
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
You need to understand that in those places

351
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
what really mattered

352
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
was, firstly, the role of Tudman and Milosevic

353
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
in coming to the agreement,

354
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and then the fact those men went,

355
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
that the regional situation improved,

356
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
that the European Union could offer Bosnia

357
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
something extraordinary:

358
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
the chance to be part

359
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
of a new thing, a new club,

360
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
a chance to join something bigger.

361
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And finally, we need to understand that in Bosnia and Kosovo,

362
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
a lot of the secret of what we did,

363
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
a lot of the secret of our success,

364
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
was our humility --

365
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
was the tentative nature of our engagement.

366
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
We criticized people a lot in Bosnia

367
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
for being quite slow to take on war criminals.

368
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
We criticized them

369
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
for being quite slow to return refugees.

370
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
But that slowness, that caution,

371
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
the fact that President Clinton initially said

372
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
that American troops would only be deployed for a year,

373
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
turned out to be a strength,

374
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and it helped us to put our priorities right.

375
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
One of the saddest things

376
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
about our involvement in Afghanistan

377
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
is that we've got our priorities out of sync.

378
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
We're not matching our resources to our priorities.

379
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Because if what we're interested in is terrorism,

380
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Pakistan is far more important than Afghanistan.

381
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
If what we're interested in is regional stability,

382
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Egypt is far more important.

383
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
If what we're worried about is poverty and development,

384
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
sub-Saharan Africa is far more important.

385
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
This doesn't mean that Afghanistan doesn't matter,

386
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
but that it's one of 40 countries in the world

387
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
with which we need to engage.

388
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
So if I can finish with a metaphor for intervention,

389
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
what we need to think of

390
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
is something like mountain rescue.

391
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
Why mountain rescue?

392
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Because when people talk about intervention,

393
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
they imagine that some scientific theory --

394
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
the Rand Corporation goes around

395
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
counting 43 previous insurgencies

396
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
producing mathematical formula

397
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
saying you need one trained counter-insurgent

398
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
for every 20 members of the population.

399
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
This is the wrong way of looking at it.

400
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
You need to look at it in the way that you look at mountain rescue.

401
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
When you're doing mountain rescue,

402
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
you don't take a doctorate in mountain rescue,

403
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
you look for somebody who knows the terrain.

404
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
It's about context.

405
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
You understand that you can prepare,

406
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
but the amount of preparation you can do

407
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
is limited --

408
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
you can take some water, you can have a map,

409
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
you can have a pack.

410
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
But what really matters

411
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
is two kinds of problems --

412
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
problems that occur on the mountain

413
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
which you couldn't anticipate,

414
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
such as, for example, ice on a slope,

415
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
but which you can get around,

416
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and problems which you couldn't anticipate

417
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
and which you can't get around,

418
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
like a sudden blizzard or an avalanche

419
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
or a change in the weather.

420
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
And the key to this

421
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
is a guide who has been on that mountain,

422
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
in every temperature,

423
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
at every period --

424
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
a guide who, above all,

425
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
knows when to turn back,

426
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
who doesn't press on relentlessly

427
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
when conditions turn against them.

428
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
What we look for

429
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
in firemen, in climbers, in policemen,

430
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and what we should look for in intervention,

431
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
is intelligent risk takers --

432
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
not people who plunge blind off a cliff,

433
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
not people who jump into a burning room,

434
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
but who weigh their risks,

435
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
weigh their responsibilities.

436
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Because the worst thing we have done in Afghanistan

437
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
is this idea

438
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
that failure is not an option.

439
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
It makes failure invisible,

440
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
inconceivable and inevitable.

441
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
And if we can resist

442
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
this crazy slogan,

443
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
we shall discover --

444
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
in Egypt, in Syria, in Libya,

445
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
and anywhere else we go in the world --

446
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
that if we can often do much less than we pretend,

447
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
we can do much more than we fear.

448
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
Thank you very much.

449
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
(Applause)

450
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
Thank you. Thank you very much.

451
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
Thank you. Thank you very much.

452
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

453
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
(Applause)

454
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
Thank you.

455
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
Thank you. Thank you.

456
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Thank you.

457
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
(Applause)

458
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
Bruno Giussani: Rory, you mentioned Libya at the end.

459
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
Just briefly, what's your take on the current events there

460
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
and the intervention?

461
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
Rory Stewart: Okay, I think Libya poses the classic problem.

462
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
The problem in Libya

463
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
is that we are always pushing for the black or white.

464
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
We imagine there are only two choices:

465
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
either full engagement and troop deployment

466
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
or total isolation.

467
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:07,000
And we are always being tempted up to our neck.

468
0:19:07.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
We put our toes in and we go up to our neck.

469
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:11,000
What we should have done in Libya

470
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
is we should have stuck to the U.N. resolution.

471
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
We should have limited ourselves very, very strictly

472
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:19,000
to the protection of the civilian population in Benghazi.

473
0:19:19.26,000 --> 0:19:21,000
We could have done that.

474
0:19:21.26,000 --> 0:19:24,000
We set up a no-fly zone within 48 hours

475
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
because Gaddafi had no planes

476
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
within 48 hours.

477
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
Instead of which, we've allowed ourselves to be tempted

478
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:33,000
towards regime change.

479
0:19:33.26,000 --> 0:19:37,000
In doing so, we've destroyed our credibility with the Security Council,

480
0:19:37.26,000 --> 0:19:39,000
which means it's very difficult

481
0:19:39.26,000 --> 0:19:41,000
to get a resolution on Syria,

482
0:19:41.26,000 --> 0:19:44,000
and we're setting ourselves up again for failure.

483
0:19:44.26,000 --> 0:19:46,000
Once more, humility,

484
0:19:46.26,000 --> 0:19:48,000
limits, honesty,

485
0:19:48.26,000 --> 0:19:5,000
realistic expectations

486
0:19:50.26,000 --> 0:19:52,000
and we could have achieved something to be proud of.

487
0:19:52.26,000 --> 0:19:54,000
BG: Rory, thank you very much.

488
0:19:54.26,000 --> 0:19:56,000
RS: Thank you. (BG: Thank you.)

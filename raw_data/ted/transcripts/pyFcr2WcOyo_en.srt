1
0:00:12.929,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I recently had an epiphany.

2
0:00:15.183,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I realized that I could actually play a role

3
0:00:19.024,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in solving one of the biggest problems that faces mankind today,

4
0:00:24.72,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and that is the problem of climate change.

5
0:00:28.497,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It also dawned on me that I had been working for 30 years or more

6
0:00:32.625,000 --> 0:00:33,000
just to get to this point in my life

7
0:00:34.57,000 --> 0:00:37,000
where I could actually make this contribution to a bigger problem.

8
0:00:38.857,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And every experiment that I have done in my lab

9
0:00:41.094,000 --> 0:00:42,000
over the last 30 years

10
0:00:43.111,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and people who work for me did in my lab over the last 30 years

11
0:00:47.323,000 --> 0:00:51,000
has been directed toward doing the really big experiment,

12
0:00:51.601,000 --> 0:00:52,000
this one last big experiment.

13
0:00:53.871,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So who am I?

14
0:00:55.046,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I'm a plant geneticist.

15
0:00:57.173,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I live in a world where there's too much CO2 in the atmosphere

16
0:01:01.434,000 --> 0:01:04,000
because of human activity.

17
0:01:05.022,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But I've come to appreciate the plants

18
0:01:08.49,000 --> 0:01:11,000
as amazing machines that they are,

19
0:01:11.646,000 --> 0:01:13,000
whose job has been, really, to just suck up CO2.

20
0:01:14.624,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And they do it so well,

21
0:01:15.884,000 --> 0:01:19,000
because they've been doing it for over 500 million years.

22
0:01:20.187,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And they're really good at it.

23
0:01:22.433,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And so ...

24
0:01:25.401,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I also have some urgency I want to tell you about.

25
0:01:28.266,000 --> 0:01:31,000
As a mother, I want to give my two children a better world

26
0:01:32.232,000 --> 0:01:33,000
than I inherited from my parents,

27
0:01:33.919,000 --> 0:01:35,000
it would be nicer to keep it going in the right direction,

28
0:01:36.665,000 --> 0:01:37,000
not the bad direction.

29
0:01:38.252,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But I also ...

30
0:01:41.569,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I've had Parkinson's for the last 15 years,

31
0:01:43.998,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and this gives me a sense of urgency that I want to do this now,

32
0:01:47.386,000 --> 0:01:5,000
while I feel good enough to really be part of this team.

33
0:01:50.998,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And I have an incredible team.

34
0:01:53.237,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We all work together,

35
0:01:55.536,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and this is something we want to do because we have fun.

36
0:01:59.427,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And if you're only going to have five people trying to save the planet,

37
0:02:02.853,000 --> 0:02:03,000
you better like each other,

38
0:02:04.18,000 --> 0:02:06,000
because you're going to be spending a lot of time together.

39
0:02:06.976,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:08.05,000 --> 0:02:09,000
OK, alright. But enough about me.

41
0:02:09.679,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Let's talk about CO2.

42
0:02:11.386,000 --> 0:02:13,000
CO2 is the star of my talk.

43
0:02:13.998,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Now, most of you probably think of CO2 as a pollutant.

44
0:02:18.323,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Or perhaps you think of CO2 as the villain in the novel, you know?

45
0:02:23.126,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It's always the dark side of CO2.

46
0:02:26.174,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But as a plant biologist, I see the other side of CO2, actually.

47
0:02:31.411,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And that CO2 that we see,

48
0:02:34.204,000 --> 0:02:38,000
we see it differently because I think we remember, as plant biologists,

49
0:02:38.888,000 --> 0:02:39,000
something you may have forgotten.

50
0:02:40.752,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And that is that plants actually do this process called photosynthesis.

51
0:02:45.632,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And when they do photosynthesis --

52
0:02:47.696,000 --> 0:02:5,000
all carbon-based life on our earth

53
0:02:51.458,000 --> 0:02:56,000
is all because of the CO2 that plants and other photosynthetic microbes

54
0:02:56.927,000 --> 0:03:,000
have dragged in from CO2 that was in the atmosphere.

55
0:03:01.341,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And almost all of the carbon in your body came from air, basically.

56
0:03:04.953,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So you come from air,

57
0:03:06.469,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and it's because of photosynthesis,

58
0:03:08.199,000 --> 0:03:11,000
because what plants do is they use the energy in sunlight,

59
0:03:11.815,000 --> 0:03:13,000
take that CO2 and fix it into sugars.

60
0:03:15.046,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It's a great thing.

61
0:03:16.384,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And the other thing that is really important

62
0:03:18.487,000 --> 0:03:19,000
for what I'm going to tell you today

63
0:03:20.241,000 --> 0:03:23,000
is that plants and other photosynthetic microbes

64
0:03:23.815,000 --> 0:03:25,000
have a great capacity for doing this --

65
0:03:26.482,000 --> 0:03:3,000
twentyfold or more than the amount of CO2 that we put up

66
0:03:30.813,000 --> 0:03:32,000
because of our human activities.

67
0:03:33.003,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And so, even though we're not doing a great job

68
0:03:36.027,000 --> 0:03:38,000
at cutting our emissions and things,

69
0:03:38.371,000 --> 0:03:41,000
plants have the capacity,

70
0:03:42.18,000 --> 0:03:44,000
as photosynthetic organisms, to help out.

71
0:03:45.18,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So we're hoping that's what they'll do.

72
0:03:48.821,000 --> 0:03:49,000
But there's a catch here.

73
0:03:50.535,000 --> 0:03:52,000
We have to help the plants a little ourselves,

74
0:03:52.797,000 --> 0:03:56,000
because what plants like to do is put most of the CO2 into sugars.

75
0:03:57.768,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And when the end of the growing season comes,

76
0:04:00.339,000 --> 0:04:02,000
the plant dies and decomposes,

77
0:04:02.72,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and then all that work they did to suck out the CO2 from the atmosphere

78
0:04:07.617,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and make carbon-based biomass

79
0:04:10.871,000 --> 0:04:14,000
is now basically going right back up in the atmosphere as CO2.

80
0:04:15.364,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So how can we get plants to redistribute the CO2 they bring in

81
0:04:21.761,000 --> 0:04:23,000
into something that's a little more stable?

82
0:04:24.196,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And so it turns out that plants make this product,

83
0:04:27.863,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and it's called suberin.

84
0:04:29.509,000 --> 0:04:32,000
This is a natural product that is in all plant roots.

85
0:04:32.846,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And suberin is really cool,

86
0:04:34.515,000 --> 0:04:36,000
because as you can see there, I hope,

87
0:04:37.236,000 --> 0:04:4,000
everywhere you see a black dot, that's a carbon.

88
0:04:40.779,000 --> 0:04:42,000
There's hundreds of them in this molecule.

89
0:04:42.867,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And where you see those few red dots,

90
0:04:45.287,000 --> 0:04:46,000
those are oxygens.

91
0:04:46.467,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And oxygen is what microbes like to find

92
0:04:48.906,000 --> 0:04:5,000
so they can decompose a plant.

93
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So you can see why this is a perfect carbon storage device.

94
0:04:54.934,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And actually it can stabilize the carbon that gets fixed by the plant

95
0:05:00.071,000 --> 0:05:03,000
into something that's a little bit better for the plant.

96
0:05:04.45,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And so, why now?

97
0:05:06.61,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Why is now a good time to do a biological solution to this problem?

98
0:05:12.204,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It's because over the last 30 or so years --

99
0:05:16.321,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and I know that's a long time, you're saying, "Why now?" --

100
0:05:19.363,000 --> 0:05:21,000
but 30 years ago, we began to understand

101
0:05:21.677,000 --> 0:05:24,000
the functions of all the genes that are in an organism in general.

102
0:05:25.307,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And that included humans as well as plants

103
0:05:28.919,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and many other complicated eukaryotes.

104
0:05:32.069,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And so, what did the 1980s begin?

105
0:05:35.22,000 --> 0:05:37,000
What began then is that we now know

106
0:05:37.427,000 --> 0:05:39,000
the function of many of the genes that are in a plant

107
0:05:39.978,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that tell a plant to grow.

108
0:05:41.427,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And that has now converged with the fact that we can do genomics

109
0:05:46.157,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in a faster and cheaper way than we ever did before.

110
0:05:49.307,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And what that tells us is that all life on earth is really related,

111
0:05:53.331,000 --> 0:05:58,000
but plants are more related to each other than other organisms.

112
0:05:58.752,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And that you can take a trait that you know from one plant

113
0:06:02.03,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and put it in another plant,

114
0:06:04.261,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and you can make a prediction that it'll do the same thing.

115
0:06:08.093,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And so that's important as well.

116
0:06:09.673,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Then finally, we have these little genetic tricks that came along,

117
0:06:13.13,000 --> 0:06:15,000
like you heard about this morning --

118
0:06:15.927,000 --> 0:06:17,000
things like CRISPR, that allows us to do editing

119
0:06:18.21,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and make genes be a little different from the normal state in the plant.

120
0:06:23.272,000 --> 0:06:25,000
OK, so now we have biology on our side.

121
0:06:25.482,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I'm a biologist, so that's why I'm proposing a solution

122
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to the climate change problem

123
0:06:32.165,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that really involves the best evolved organism on earth to do it -- plants.

124
0:06:37.546,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So how are we going to do it?

125
0:06:39.8,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Biology comes to the rescue.

126
0:06:41.287,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Here we go.

127
0:06:43.204,000 --> 0:06:44,000
OK.

128
0:06:45.634,000 --> 0:06:49,000
You have to remember three simple things from my talk, OK?

129
0:06:50.569,000 --> 0:06:53,000
We have to get plants to make more suberin than they normally make,

130
0:06:54.149,000 --> 0:06:56,000
because we need them to be a little better than what they are.

131
0:06:57.13,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We have to get them to make more roots,

132
0:07:01.522,000 --> 0:07:03,000
because if we make more roots, we can make more suberin --

133
0:07:04.284,000 --> 0:07:08,000
now we have more of the cells that suberin likes to accumulate in.

134
0:07:09.061,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And then the third thing is, we want the plants to have deeper roots.

135
0:07:12.514,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And what that does is --

136
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
we're asking the plant, actually, "OK, make stable carbon,

137
0:07:17.951,000 --> 0:07:18,000
more than you used to,

138
0:07:19.419,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and then bury it for us in the ground."

139
0:07:21.768,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So they can do that if they make roots that go deep

140
0:07:24.237,000 --> 0:07:27,000
rather than meander around on the surface of the soil.

141
0:07:27.871,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Those are the three traits we want to change:

142
0:07:30.583,000 --> 0:07:34,000
more suberin, more roots, and the last one, deep roots.

143
0:07:35.514,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Then we want to combine all those traits in one plant,

144
0:07:38.292,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and we can do that easily and we will do it,

145
0:07:41.3,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and we are doing it actually, in the model plant, Arabidopsis,

146
0:07:45.776,000 --> 0:07:47,000
which allows us to do these experiments much faster

147
0:07:48.674,000 --> 0:07:51,000
than we can do in another big plant.

148
0:07:51.982,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And when we find that we have plants where traits all add up

149
0:07:55.752,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and we can get more of them, more suberin in those plants,

150
0:07:58.887,000 --> 0:07:59,000
we're going to move it all --

151
0:08:00.299,000 --> 0:08:02,000
we can and we we will, we're beginning to do this --

152
0:08:02.906,000 --> 0:08:03,000
move it to crop plants.

153
0:08:04.839,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And I'll tell you why we're picking crop plants to do the work for us

154
0:08:09.268,000 --> 0:08:11,000
when I get to that part of my talk.

155
0:08:12.188,000 --> 0:08:15,000
OK, so I think this is the science behind the whole thing.

156
0:08:16.141,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And so I know we can do the science, I feel pretty confident about that.

157
0:08:20.109,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And the reason is because, just in the last year,

158
0:08:22.434,000 --> 0:08:26,000
we've been able to find single genes that affect each of those three traits.

159
0:08:27.307,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And in several of those cases, two out of the three,

160
0:08:31.339,000 --> 0:08:33,000
we have more than one way to get there.

161
0:08:33.744,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So that tells us we might be able to even combine within a trait

162
0:08:37.18,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and get even more suberin.

163
0:08:41.735,000 --> 0:08:42,000
This shows one result,

164
0:08:43.18,000 --> 0:08:44,000
where we have a plant here on the right

165
0:08:45.07,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that's making more than double the amount of root

166
0:08:47.844,000 --> 0:08:48,000
than the plant on the left,

167
0:08:49.199,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and that's just because of the way we expressed one gene

168
0:08:51.916,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that's normally in the plant

169
0:08:53.394,000 --> 0:08:57,000
in a slightly different way than the plant usually does on its own.

170
0:08:57.911,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Alright, so that's just one example I wanted to show you.

171
0:09:00.895,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And now I want to tell you that, you know,

172
0:09:02.99,000 --> 0:09:04,000
we still have a lot of challenges, actually,

173
0:09:05.272,000 --> 0:09:06,000
when we get to this problem,

174
0:09:07.022,000 --> 0:09:09,000
because it takes ...

175
0:09:09.99,000 --> 0:09:12,000
We have to get the farmers to actually buy the seeds,

176
0:09:13.017,000 --> 0:09:15,000
or at least the seed company to buy seeds

177
0:09:15.493,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that farmers are going to want to have.

178
0:09:18.08,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And so when we do the experiments,

179
0:09:20.509,000 --> 0:09:23,000
we can't actually take a loss in yield,

180
0:09:24.236,000 --> 0:09:26,000
because while we are doing these experiments,

181
0:09:27.252,000 --> 0:09:29,000
say, beginning about 10 years from now,

182
0:09:29.998,000 --> 0:09:32,000
the earth's population will be even more than it is right now.

183
0:09:33.208,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And it's rapidly growing still.

184
0:09:35.776,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So by the end of the century, we have 11 billion people,

185
0:09:38.454,000 --> 0:09:42,000
we have wasted ecosystems that aren't really going to be able to handle

186
0:09:42.766,000 --> 0:09:45,000
all the load they have to take from agriculture.

187
0:09:46.567,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And then we also have this competition for land.

188
0:09:51.209,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And so we figure, to do this carbon sequestration experiment

189
0:09:56.474,000 --> 0:10:,000
actually requires a fair amount of land.

190
0:10:00.815,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We can't take it away from food,

191
0:10:03.379,000 --> 0:10:06,000
because we have to feed the people that are also going to be on the earth

192
0:10:06.919,000 --> 0:10:08,000
until we get past this big crisis.

193
0:10:09.483,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And the climate change is actually causing loss of yield all over the earth.

194
0:10:13.84,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So why would farmers want to buy seeds

195
0:10:16.927,000 --> 0:10:17,000
if it's going to impact yield?

196
0:10:18.403,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So we're not going to let it impact yield,

197
0:10:20.458,000 --> 0:10:22,000
we're going to always have checks and balances

198
0:10:22.681,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that says go or no go on that experiment.

199
0:10:25.895,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And then the second thing is, when a plant actually makes more carbon

200
0:10:29.988,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and buries it in the soil like that,

201
0:10:31.879,000 --> 0:10:34,000
almost all the soils on earth are actually depleted of carbon

202
0:10:35.458,000 --> 0:10:37,000
because of the load from agriculture,

203
0:10:38.205,000 --> 0:10:4,000
trying to feed eight billion people,

204
0:10:40.705,000 --> 0:10:42,000
which is what lives on the earth right now.

205
0:10:43.372,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And so, that is also a problem as well.

206
0:10:48.212,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Plants that are making more carbon, those soils become enriched in carbon.

207
0:10:51.729,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And carbon-enriched soils actually hold nitrogen

208
0:10:56.388,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and they hold sulphur and they hold phosphate --

209
0:10:58.664,000 --> 0:11:01,000
all the minerals that are required for plants to grow and have a good yield.

210
0:11:02.284,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And they also retain water in the soil as well.

211
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
So the suberin will break up into little particles

212
0:11:07.634,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and give the whole soil a new texture.

213
0:11:10.18,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And as we've shown that we can get more carbon in that soil,

214
0:11:13.911,000 --> 0:11:14,000
the soil will get darker.

215
0:11:15.871,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And so we will be able to measure all that,

216
0:11:18.95,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and hopefully, this is going to help us solve the problem.

217
0:11:22.363,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So, OK.

218
0:11:23.823,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So we have the challenges of a lot of land that we need to use,

219
0:11:27.752,000 --> 0:11:28,000
we have to get farmers to buy it,

220
0:11:29.399,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and that's going to be the hard thing for us, I think,

221
0:11:32.038,000 --> 0:11:34,000
because we're not really salesmen,

222
0:11:34.96,000 --> 0:11:37,000
we're people who like to Google a person rather than meet them,

223
0:11:37.998,000 --> 0:11:38,000
you know what I mean?

224
0:11:39.288,000 --> 0:11:4,000
(Laughter)

225
0:11:40.324,000 --> 0:11:42,000
That's what scientists are mostly like.

226
0:11:43.291,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But we know now that, you know, no one can really deny --

227
0:11:46.967,000 --> 0:11:49,000
the climate is changing, everyone knows that.

228
0:11:50.18,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And it's here and it's bad and it's serious,

229
0:11:52.3,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and we need to do something about it.

230
0:11:54.173,000 --> 0:11:57,000
But I feel pretty optimistic that we can do this.

231
0:11:57.244,000 --> 0:12:01,000
So I'm here today as a character witness for plants.

232
0:12:01.538,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And I want to tell you that plants are going to do it for us,

233
0:12:04.483,000 --> 0:12:06,000
all we have to do is give them a little help,

234
0:12:06.69,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and they will go and get a gold medal for humanity.

235
0:12:09.235,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Thank you very much.

236
0:12:10.671,000 --> 0:12:13,000
(Applause)

237
0:12:14.682,000 --> 0:12:15,000
(Cheers)

238
0:12:16.642,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Thank you.

239
0:12:17.817,000 --> 0:12:21,000
(Applause)

240
0:12:25.428,000 --> 0:12:26,000
I finally got it out.

241
0:12:30.817,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Chris Anderson: Wow.

242
0:12:32.831,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Joanne, you're so extraordinary.

243
0:12:34.79,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Just to be sure we heard this right:

244
0:12:36.553,000 --> 0:12:39,000
you believe that within the next 10 years

245
0:12:39.815,000 --> 0:12:41,000
you may be able to offer the world

246
0:12:43.895,000 --> 0:12:48,000
seed variants for the major crops, like -- what? -- wheat, corn, maybe rice,

247
0:12:50.331,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that can offer farmers just as much yield,

248
0:12:53.792,000 --> 0:12:58,000
sequester three times, four times, more carbon than they currently do?

249
0:12:59.315,000 --> 0:13:,000
Even more than that?

250
0:13:00.49,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Joanne Chory: We don't know that number, really.

251
0:13:02.789,000 --> 0:13:03,000
But they will do more.

252
0:13:04.387,000 --> 0:13:05,000
CA: And at the same time,

253
0:13:05.793,000 --> 0:13:08,000
make the soil that those farmers have more fertile?

254
0:13:09.235,000 --> 0:13:1,000
JC: Yes, right.

255
0:13:10.903,000 --> 0:13:11,000
CA: So that is astonishing.

256
0:13:12.704,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And the genius of doing that and a solution that can scale

257
0:13:16.633,000 --> 0:13:17,000
where there's already scale.

258
0:13:18.061,000 --> 0:13:19,000
JC: Yes, thank you for saying that.

259
0:13:19.776,000 --> 0:13:2,000
CA: No, no, you said it, you said it.

260
0:13:21.784,000 --> 0:13:24,000
But it almost seems too good to be true.

261
0:13:25.919,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Your Audacious Project is that we scale up the research in your lab

262
0:13:30.24,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and pave the way to start some of these pilots

263
0:13:34.323,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and make this incredible vision possible.

264
0:13:36.585,000 --> 0:13:37,000
JC: That's right, yes, thank you.

265
0:13:38.411,000 --> 0:13:39,000
CA: Joanne Chory, thank you so much.

266
0:13:40.214,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Godspeed.

267
0:13:41.439,000 --> 0:13:43,000
(Applause)

268
0:13:44.325,000 --> 0:13:45,000
JC: Thank you.

0:00:16.25,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Hi. This is my mobile phone.

3
0:00:23.795,000 --> 0:00:3,000
A mobile phone can change your life,

4
0:00:31.238,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom.

5
0:00:40.07,000 --> 0:00:42,000
With a mobile phone,

6
0:00:42.438,000 --> 0:00:46,000
you can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria.

7
0:00:47.222,000 --> 0:00:48,000
With a mobile phone,

8
0:00:49.174,000 --> 0:00:51,000
you can tweet a message

9
0:00:51.462,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and start a protest in Egypt.

10
0:00:57.305,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And with a mobile phone,

11
0:00:59.782,000 --> 0:01:01,000
you can record a song, load it up to

12
0:01:02.703,000 --> 0:01:04,000
SoundCloud and become famous.

13
0:01:05.184,000 --> 0:01:09,000
All this is possible with your mobile phone.

14
0:01:09.754,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I'm a child of 1984,

15
0:01:11.803,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and I live in the city of Berlin.

16
0:01:15.164,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Let's go back to that time, to this city.

17
0:01:20.844,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Here you can see

18
0:01:22.083,000 --> 0:01:24,000
how hundreds of thousands of people

19
0:01:24.267,000 --> 0:01:28,000
stood up and protested for change.

20
0:01:28.506,000 --> 0:01:31,000
This is autumn 1989,

21
0:01:31.692,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and imagine that all those people standing up

22
0:01:36.315,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and protesting for change had a

23
0:01:39.124,000 --> 0:01:42,000
mobile phone in their pocket.

24
0:01:42.284,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Who in the room has a mobile phone with you?

25
0:01:44.011,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Hold it up.

26
0:01:45.146,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Hold your phones up, hold your phones up!

27
0:01:48.275,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.

28
0:01:51.001,000 --> 0:01:57,000
That's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile phone.

29
0:01:57.394,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But today I will talk about me and my mobile phone,

30
0:02:01.946,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and how it changed my life.

31
0:02:05.463,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And I will talk about this.

32
0:02:09.043,000 --> 0:02:14,000
These are 35,830 lines of information.

33
0:02:14.146,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Raw data.

34
0:02:16.909,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And why are these informations there?

35
0:02:21.535,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Because in the summer of 2006,

36
0:02:24.516,000 --> 0:02:27,000
the E.U. Commission tabled a directive.

37
0:02:28.003,000 --> 0:02:32,000
This directive [is] called Data Retention Directive.

38
0:02:32.668,000 --> 0:02:36,000
This directive says that each phone company in Europe,

39
0:02:37.027,000 --> 0:02:41,000
each Internet service company all over Europe,

40
0:02:41.524,000 --> 0:02:46,000
has to store a wide range of information about the users.

41
0:02:46.803,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Who calls whom? Who sends whom an email?

42
0:02:49.964,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Who sends whom a text message?

43
0:02:52.108,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And if you use your mobile phone, where you are.

44
0:02:56.443,000 --> 0:03:,000
All this information is stored for at least six months,

45
0:03:00.895,000 --> 0:03:03,000
up to two years by your phone company

46
0:03:04.179,000 --> 0:03:1,000
or your Internet service provider.

47
0:03:10.251,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And all over Europe, people stood up and said,

48
0:03:13.911,000 --> 0:03:15,000
"We don't want this."

49
0:03:16.418,000 --> 0:03:19,000
They said, we don't want this data retention.

50
0:03:19.816,000 --> 0:03:22,000
We want self-determination in the digital age,

51
0:03:23.353,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and we don't want that phone companies and Internet companies

52
0:03:26.352,000 --> 0:03:29,000
have to store all this information about us.

53
0:03:29.801,000 --> 0:03:31,000
They were lawyers, journalists, priests,

54
0:03:32.484,000 --> 0:03:35,000
they all said: "We don't want this."

55
0:03:35.64,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And here you can see, like 10 thousands of people

56
0:03:38.707,000 --> 0:03:4,000
went out on the streets of Berlin and said,

57
0:03:41.363,000 --> 0:03:44,000
"Freedom, not fear."

58
0:03:44.57,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And some even said, this would be Stasi 2.0.

59
0:03:49.019,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Stasi was the secret police in East Germany.

60
0:03:55.056,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And I also ask myself, does it really work?

61
0:03:59.537,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Can they really store all this information about us?

62
0:04:02.969,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Every time I use my mobile phone?

63
0:04:06.614,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So I asked my phone company, Deutsche Telekom,

64
0:04:10.37,000 --> 0:04:13,000
which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany,

65
0:04:14.135,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and I asked them, please,

66
0:04:15.531,000 --> 0:04:19,000
send me all the information you have stored about me.

67
0:04:19.902,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And I asked them once, and I asked them again,

68
0:04:22.061,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and I got no real answer. It was only blah blah answers.

69
0:04:25.237,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But then I said, I want to have this information,

70
0:04:28.349,000 --> 0:04:32,000
because this is my life you are protocoling.

71
0:04:33.101,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So I decided to start a lawsuit against them,

72
0:04:37.093,000 --> 0:04:39,000
because I wanted to have this information.

73
0:04:40.053,000 --> 0:04:42,000
But Deutsche Telekom said, no,

74
0:04:42.053,000 --> 0:04:44,000
we will not give you this information.

75
0:04:44.805,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So at the end, I had a settlement with them.

76
0:04:49.022,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I'll put down the lawsuit

77
0:04:50.381,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and they will send me all the information I ask for.

78
0:04:53.589,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Because in the mean time,

79
0:04:54.806,000 --> 0:04:56,000
the German Constitutional Court ruled

80
0:04:57.043,000 --> 0:05:,000
that the implementation of this E.U. directive

81
0:05:00.86,000 --> 0:05:04,000
into German law was unconstitutional.

82
0:05:05.279,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So I got this ugly brown envelope

83
0:05:07.397,000 --> 0:05:09,000
with a C.D. inside.

84
0:05:09.965,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And on the C.D., this was on.

85
0:05:13.045,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Thirty-five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information.

86
0:05:18.406,000 --> 0:05:2,000
At first I saw it, and I said, okay,

87
0:05:20.821,000 --> 0:05:23,000
it's a huge file. Okay.

88
0:05:24.224,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But then after a while I realized,

89
0:05:26.741,000 --> 0:05:28,000
this is my life.

90
0:05:29.029,000 --> 0:05:3,000
This is six months of my life,

91
0:05:30.813,000 --> 0:05:34,000
into this file.

92
0:05:35.111,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I do with it?

93
0:05:39.361,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Because you can see where I am,

94
0:05:42.54,000 --> 0:05:44,000
where I sleep at night,

95
0:05:44.748,000 --> 0:05:48,000
what I am doing.

96
0:05:49.452,000 --> 0:05:53,000
But then I said, I want to go out with this information.

97
0:05:54.045,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I want to make them public.

98
0:05:55.821,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Because I want to show the people what does data retention mean.

99
0:06:00.235,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So together with Zeit Online and Open Data City, I did this.

100
0:06:05.499,000 --> 0:06:09,000
This is a visualization of six months of my life.

101
0:06:09.627,000 --> 0:06:1,000
You can zoom in and zoom out,

102
0:06:11.515,000 --> 0:06:13,000
you can wind back and fast forward.

103
0:06:13.964,000 --> 0:06:16,000
You can see every step I take.

104
0:06:17.382,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And you can even see

105
0:06:19.707,000 --> 0:06:22,000
how I go from Frankfurt by train

106
0:06:22.756,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to Cologne, and how often I call in between.

107
0:06:26.988,000 --> 0:06:3,000
All this is possible with this information.

108
0:06:31.721,000 --> 0:06:36,000
That's a little bit scary.

109
0:06:37.176,000 --> 0:06:42,000
But it is not only about me.

110
0:06:42.676,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It's about all of us.

111
0:06:45.076,000 --> 0:06:49,000
First, it's only like, I call my wife and she calls me,

112
0:06:49.8,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and we talk to each other a couple of times.

113
0:06:52.471,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And then there are some friends calling me,

114
0:06:54.933,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and they call each other.

115
0:06:56.861,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And after a while you are calling you,

116
0:06:58.98,000 --> 0:07:,000
and you are calling you, and you have this great

117
0:07:01.244,000 --> 0:07:03,000
communication network.

118
0:07:03.668,000 --> 0:07:07,000
But you can see how your people are communicating with each other,

119
0:07:08.149,000 --> 0:07:11,000
what times they call each other, when they go to bed.

120
0:07:11.452,000 --> 0:07:13,000
You can see all of this.

121
0:07:13.606,000 --> 0:07:17,000
You can see the hubs, like who are the leaders in the group.

122
0:07:17.621,000 --> 0:07:2,000
If you have access to this information,

123
0:07:21.101,000 --> 0:07:24,000
you can see what your society is doing.

124
0:07:24.948,000 --> 0:07:26,000
If you have access to this information,

125
0:07:27.573,000 --> 0:07:31,000
you can control your society.

126
0:07:31.99,000 --> 0:07:35,000
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.

127
0:07:36.966,000 --> 0:07:4,000
This is a blueprint how to survey your society,

128
0:07:41.134,000 --> 0:07:43,000
because you know who talks to whom,

129
0:07:43.75,000 --> 0:07:45,000
who sends whom an email, all this is possible

130
0:07:46.631,000 --> 0:07:48,000
if you have access to this information.

131
0:07:49.329,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And this information is stored for at least six months

132
0:07:52.366,000 --> 0:07:56,000
in Europe, up to two years.

133
0:07:57.353,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Like I said at the beginning,

134
0:07:58.968,000 --> 0:08:01,000
imagine that all those people on the streets of Berlin

135
0:08:02.401,000 --> 0:08:04,000
in autumn of 1989

136
0:08:04.849,000 --> 0:08:07,000
had a mobile phone in their pocket.

137
0:08:07.872,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And the Stasi would have known who took part at this protest,

138
0:08:11.841,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and if the Stasi would have known

139
0:08:13.528,000 --> 0:08:16,000
who are the leaders behind it,

140
0:08:17.022,000 --> 0:08:2,000
this may never have happened.

141
0:08:20.243,000 --> 0:08:23,000
The fall of the Berlin Wall would maybe not [have been] there.

142
0:08:23.274,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And in the aftermath, also not the fall of the Iron Curtain.

143
0:08:26.89,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Because today, state agencies and companies

144
0:08:31.498,000 --> 0:08:35,000
want to store as much information as they can get about us,

145
0:08:35.787,000 --> 0:08:36,000
online and offline.

146
0:08:37.667,000 --> 0:08:41,000
They want to have the possibility to track our lives,

147
0:08:41.874,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and they want to store them for all time.

148
0:08:45.722,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But self-determination and living in the digital age

149
0:08:50.165,000 --> 0:08:52,000
is no contradiction.

150
0:08:52.862,000 --> 0:08:57,000
But you have to fight for your self-determination today.

151
0:08:58.021,000 --> 0:09:02,000
You have to fight for it every day.

152
0:09:02.048,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So, when you go home,

153
0:09:04.81,000 --> 0:09:05,000
tell your friends

154
0:09:06.466,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that privacy is a value of the 21st century,

155
0:09:10.777,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and it's not outdated.

156
0:09:13.297,000 --> 0:09:17,000
When you go home, tell your representative

157
0:09:17.363,000 --> 0:09:21,000
only because companies and state agencies have the possibility

158
0:09:21.842,000 --> 0:09:26,000
to store certain information, they don't have to do it.

159
0:09:27.258,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And if you don't believe me,

160
0:09:29.603,000 --> 0:09:36,000
ask your phone company what information they store about you.

161
0:09:37.226,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So, in the future, every time you use your mobile phone,

162
0:09:44.086,000 --> 0:09:47,000
let it be a reminder to you

163
0:09:47.158,000 --> 0:09:5,000
that you have to fight for self-determination in the digital age.

164
0:09:50.925,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Thank you.

165
0:09:52.15,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Applause)

0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
A few months ago

3
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
the Nobel Prize in physics

4
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
was awarded to two teams of astronomers

5
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
for a discovery that has been hailed

6
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
as one of the most important

7
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
astronomical observations ever.

8
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And today, after briefly describing what they found,

9
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I'm going to tell you about a highly controversial framework

10
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
for explaining their discovery,

11
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
namely the possibility

12
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that way beyond the Earth,

13
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the Milky Way and other distant galaxies,

14
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
we may find that our universe

15
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
is not the only universe,

16
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
but is instead

17
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
part of a vast complex of universes

18
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that we call the multiverse.

19
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one.

20
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I mean, most of us were raised to believe

21
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that the word "universe" means everything.

22
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And I say most of us with forethought,

23
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
as my four-year-old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born.

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And last year I was holding her

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and I said, "Sophia,

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I love you more than anything in the universe."

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And she turned to me and said, "Daddy,

28
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
universe or multiverse?"

29
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But barring such an anomalous upbringing,

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
it is strange to imagine

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
other realms separate from ours,

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
most with fundamentally different features,

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that would rightly be called universes of their own.

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And yet,

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
speculative though the idea surely is,

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I aim to convince you

38
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that there's reason for taking it seriously,

39
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
as it just might be right.

40
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I'm going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts.

41
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
In part one,

42
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I'm going to describe those Nobel Prize-winning results

43
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and to highlight a profound mystery

44
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
which those results revealed.

45
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
In part two,

46
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I'll offer a solution to that mystery.

47
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
It's based on an approach called string theory,

48
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and that's where the idea of the multiverse

49
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
will come into the story.

50
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Finally, in part three,

51
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I'm going to describe a cosmological theory

52
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
called inflation,

53
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
which will pull all the pieces of the story together.

54
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Okay, part one starts back in 1929

55
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
when the great astronomer Edwin Hubble

56
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
realized that the distant galaxies

57
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
were all rushing away from us,

58
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
establishing that space itself is stretching,

59
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
it's expanding.

60
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Now this was revolutionary.

61
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
The prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales

62
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the universe was static.

63
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
But even so,

64
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
there was one thing that everyone was certain of:

65
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The expansion must be slowing down.

66
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
That, much as the gravitational pull of the Earth

67
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward,

68
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
the gravitational pull

69
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
of each galaxy on every other

70
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
must be slowing

71
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the expansion of space.

72
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Now let's fast-forward to the 1990s

73
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
when those two teams of astronomers

74
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I mentioned at the outset

75
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
were inspired by this reasoning

76
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to measure the rate

77
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
at which the expansion has been slowing.

78
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And they did this

79
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
by painstaking observations

80
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
of numerous distant galaxies,

81
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
allowing them to chart

82
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
how the expansion rate has changed over time.

83
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Here's the surprise:

84
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
They found that the expansion is not slowing down.

85
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Instead they found that it's speeding up,

86
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
going faster and faster.

87
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
That's like tossing an apple upward

88
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and it goes up faster and faster.

89
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now if you saw an apple do that,

90
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
you'd want to know why.

91
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
What's pushing on it?

92
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Similarly, the astronomers' results

93
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
are surely well-deserving of the Nobel Prize,

94
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
but they raised an analogous question.

95
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
What force is driving all galaxies

96
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
to rush away from every other

97
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
at an ever-quickening speed?

98
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Well the most promising answer

99
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
comes from an old idea of Einstein's.

100
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
You see, we are all used to gravity

101
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
being a force that does one thing,

102
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
pulls objects together.

103
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But in Einstein's theory of gravity,

104
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
his general theory of relativity,

105
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
gravity can also push things apart.

106
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
How? Well according to Einstein's math,

107
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
if space is uniformly filled

108
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
with an invisible energy,

109
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
sort of like a uniform, invisible mist,

110
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
then the gravity generated by that mist

111
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
would be repulsive,

112
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
repulsive gravity,

113
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
which is just what we need to explain the observations.

114
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Because the repulsive gravity

115
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
of an invisible energy in space --

116
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
we now call it dark energy,

117
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but I've made it smokey white here so you can see it --

118
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
its repulsive gravity

119
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
would cause each galaxy to push against every other,

120
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
driving expansion to speed up,

121
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
not slow down.

122
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And this explanation

123
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
represents great progress.

124
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But I promised you a mystery

125
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
here in part one.

126
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Here it is.

127
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
When the astronomers worked out

128
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
how much of this dark energy

129
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
must be infusing space

130
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to account for the cosmic speed up,

131
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
look at what they found.

132
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
This number is small.

133
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Expressed in the relevant unit,

134
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
it is spectacularly small.

135
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number.

136
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We want this number

137
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to emerge from the laws of physics,

138
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
but so far no one has found a way to do that.

139
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Now you might wonder,

140
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
should you care?

141
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Maybe explaining this number

142
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
is just a technical issue,

143
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
a technical detail of interest to experts,

144
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but of no relevance to anybody else.

145
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Well it surely is a technical detail,

146
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
but some details really matter.

147
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Some details provide

148
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
windows into uncharted realms of reality,

149
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and this peculiar number may be doing just that,

150
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
as the only approach that's so far made headway to explain it

151
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
invokes the possibility of other universes --

152
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
an idea that naturally emerges from string theory,

153
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
which takes me to part two: string theory.

154
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So hold the mystery of the dark energy

155
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
in the back of your mind

156
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
as I now go on to tell you

157
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
three key things about string theory.

158
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
First off, what is it?

159
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Well it's an approach to realize Einstein's dream

160
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
of a unified theory of physics,

161
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
a single overarching framework

162
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that would be able to describe

163
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
all the forces at work in the universe.

164
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And the central idea of string theory

165
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
is quite straightforward.

166
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It says that if you examine

167
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
any piece of matter ever more finely,

168
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
at first you'll find molecules

169
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and then you'll find atoms and subatomic particles.

170
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But the theory says that if you could probe smaller,

171
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
much smaller than we can with existing technology,

172
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
you'd find something else inside these particles --

173
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
a little tiny vibrating filament of energy,

174
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
a little tiny vibrating string.

175
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And just like the strings on a violin,

176
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
they can vibrate in different patterns

177
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
producing different musical notes.

178
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
These little fundamental strings,

179
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
when they vibrate in different patterns,

180
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
they produce different kinds of particles --

181
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
so electrons, quarks, neutrinos, photons,

182
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
all other particles

183
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
would be united into a single framework,

184
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
as they would all arise from vibrating strings.

185
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It's a compelling picture,

186
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
a kind of cosmic symphony,

187
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
where all the richness

188
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that we see in the world around us

189
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
emerges from the music

190
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that these little, tiny strings can play.

191
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But there's a cost

192
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to this elegant unification,

193
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
because years of research

194
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
have shown that the math of string theory doesn't quite work.

195
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
It has internal inconsistencies,

196
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
unless we allow

197
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
for something wholly unfamiliar --

198
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
extra dimensions of space.

199
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
That is, we all know about the usual three dimensions of space.

200
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And you can think about those

201
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
as height, width and depth.

202
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
But string theory says that, on fantastically small scales,

203
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
there are additional dimensions

204
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
crumpled to a tiny size so small

205
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that we have not detected them.

206
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But even though the dimensions are hidden,

207
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
they would have an impact on things that we can observe

208
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
because the shape of the extra dimensions

209
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
constrains how the strings can vibrate.

210
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And in string theory,

211
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
vibration determines everything.

212
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So particle masses, the strengths of forces,

213
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and most importantly, the amount of dark energy

214
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
would be determined

215
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
by the shape of the extra dimensions.

216
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions,

217
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
we should be able to calculate these features,

218
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
calculate the amount of dark energy.

219
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
The challenge

220
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
is we don't know

221
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
the shape of the extra dimensions.

222
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
All we have

223
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
is a list of candidate shapes

224
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
allowed by the math.

225
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Now when these ideas were first developed,

226
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
there were only about five different candidate shapes,

227
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
so you can imagine

228
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
analyzing them one-by-one

229
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to determine if any yield

230
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
the physical features we observe.

231
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But over time the list grew

232
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
as researchers found other candidate shapes.

233
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
From five, the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands --

234
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
A large, but still manageable, collection to analyze,

235
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
since after all,

236
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
graduate students need something to do.

237
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But then the list continued to grow

238
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
into the millions and the billions, until today.

239
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
The list of candidate shapes

240
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
has soared to about 10 to the 500.

241
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So, what to do?

242
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Well some researchers lost heart,

243
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions,

244
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
each giving rise to different physical features,

245
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
string theory would never make

246
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
definitive, testable predictions.

247
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
But others turned this issue on its head,

248
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
taking us to the possibility of a multiverse.

249
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Here's the idea.

250
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other.

251
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Each is as real as every other,

252
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
in the sense

253
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that there are many universes,

254
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
each with a different shape, for the extra dimensions.

255
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And this radical proposal

256
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
has a profound impact on this mystery:

257
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize-winning results.

258
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Because you see,

259
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
if there are other universes,

260
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and if those universes

261
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
each have, say, a different shape for the extra dimensions,

262
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
then the physical features of each universe will be different,

263
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and in particular,

264
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
the amount of dark energy in each universe

265
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
will be different.

266
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Which means that the mystery

267
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
of explaining the amount of dark energy we've now measured

268
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
would take on a wholly different character.

269
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
In this context,

270
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
the laws of physics can't explain one number for the dark energy

271
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
because there isn't just one number,

272
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
there are many numbers.

273
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Which means

274
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
we have been asking the wrong question.

275
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
It's that the right question to ask is,

276
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
why do we humans find ourselves in a universe

277
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
with a particular amount of dark energy we've measured

278
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
instead of any of the other possibilities

279
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
that are out there?

280
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And that's a question on which we can make headway.

281
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Because those universes

282
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that have much more dark energy than ours,

283
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies,

284
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong

285
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
that it blows the clump apart

286
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and galaxies don't form.

287
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And in those universes that have much less dark energy,

288
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
well they collapse back on themselves so quickly

289
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that, again, galaxies don't form.

290
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And without galaxies, there are no stars, no planets

291
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and no chance

292
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
for our form of life

293
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
to exist in those other universes.

294
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
So we find ourselves in a universe

295
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
with the particular amount of dark energy we've measured

296
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
simply because our universe has conditions

297
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
hospitable to our form of life.

298
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And that would be that.

299
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Mystery solved,

300
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
multiverse found.

301
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Now some find this explanation unsatisfying.

302
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
We're used to physics

303
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe.

304
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
But the point is,

305
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
if the feature you're observing

306
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
can and does take on

307
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
a wide variety of different values

308
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
across the wider landscape of reality,

309
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
then thinking one explanation

310
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
for a particular value

311
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
is simply misguided.

312
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
An early example

313
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler

314
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
who was obsessed with understanding

315
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
a different number --

316
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
why the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth.

317
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And he worked for decades trying to explain this number,

318
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
but he never succeeded, and we know why.

319
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Kepler was asking

320
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
the wrong question.

321
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
We now know that there are many planets

322
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars.

323
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So hoping that the laws of physics

324
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
will explain one particular number, 93 million miles,

325
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
well that is simply wrongheaded.

326
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Instead the right question to ask is,

327
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
why do we humans find ourselves on a planet

328
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
at this particular distance,

329
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
instead of any of the other possibilities?

330
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And again, that's a question we can answer.

331
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun

332
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
would be so hot

333
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
that our form of life wouldn't exist.

334
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And those planets that are much farther away from the star,

335
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
well they're so cold

336
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
that, again, our form of life would not take hold.

337
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
So we find ourselves

338
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
on a planet at this particular distance

339
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
simply because it yields conditions

340
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
vital to our form of life.

341
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And when it comes to planets and their distances,

342
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
this clearly is the right kind of reasoning.

343
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
The point is,

344
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain,

345
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
it may also be the right kind of reasoning.

346
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
One key difference, of course,

347
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
is we know that there are other planets out there,

348
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
but so far I've only speculated on the possibility

349
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
that there might be other universes.

350
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
So to pull it all together,

351
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
we need a mechanism

352
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
that can actually generate other universes.

353
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And that takes me to my final part, part three.

354
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Because such a mechanism has been found

355
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
by cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang.

356
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
You see, when we speak of the Big Bang,

357
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
we often have an image

358
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
of a kind of cosmic explosion

359
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
that created our universe

360
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and set space rushing outward.

361
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
But there's a little secret.

362
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important,

363
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
the Bang.

364
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang,

365
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
but gives us no insight

366
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
into what would have powered the Bang itself.

367
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And this gap was finally filled

368
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory.

369
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
It's called inflationary cosmology,

370
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
which identified a particular kind of fuel

371
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
that would naturally generate

372
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
an outward rush of space.

373
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
The fuel is based on something called a quantum field,

374
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
but the only detail that matters for us

375
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
is that this fuel proves to be so efficient

376
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
that it's virtually impossible

377
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
to use it all up,

378
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
which means in the inflationary theory,

379
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
the Big Bang giving rise to our universe

380
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
is likely not a one-time event.

381
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Instead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang,

382
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
but it would also generate countless other Big Bangs,

383
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
each giving rise to its own separate universe

384
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
with our universe becoming but one bubble

385
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes.

386
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And now, when we meld this with string theory,

387
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
here's the picture we're led to.

388
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Each of these universes has extra dimensions.

389
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes.

390
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
The different shapes yield different physical features.

391
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another

392
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
simply because it's only in our universe

393
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
that the physical features, like the amount of dark energy,

394
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
are right for our form of life to take hold.

395
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
And this is the compelling but highly controversial picture

396
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
of the wider cosmos

397
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
that cutting-edge observation and theory

398
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
have now led us to seriously consider.

399
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
One big remaining question, of course, is,

400
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
could we ever confirm

401
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
the existence of other universes?

402
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Well let me describe

403
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
one way that might one day happen.

404
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
The inflationary theory

405
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
already has strong observational support.

406
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
Because the theory predicts

407
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
that the Big Bang would have been so intense

408
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
that as space rapidly expanded,

409
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
tiny quantum jitters from the micro world

410
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
would have been stretched out to the macro world,

411
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
yielding a distinctive fingerprint,

412
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots,

413
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
across space,

414
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
which powerful telescopes have now observed.

415
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Going further, if there are other universes,

416
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
the theory predicts that every so often

417
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
those universes can collide.

418
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
And if our universe got hit by another,

419
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
that collision

420
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
would generate an additional subtle pattern

421
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
of temperature variations across space

422
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
that we might one day

423
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
be able to detect.

424
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
And so exotic as this picture is,

425
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
it may one day be grounded

426
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
in observations,

427
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
establishing the existence of other universes.

428
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
I'll conclude

429
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
with a striking implication

430
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
of all these ideas

431
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
for the very far future.

432
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
You see, we learned

433
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
that our universe is not static,

434
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
that space is expanding,

435
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
that that expansion is speeding up

436
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
and that there might be other universes

437
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
all by carefully examining

438
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
faint pinpoints of starlight

439
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
coming to us from distant galaxies.

440
0:18:15.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
But because the expansion is speeding up,

441
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
in the very far future,

442
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast

443
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
that we won't be able to see them --

444
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
not because of technological limitations,

445
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
but because of the laws of physics.

446
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
The light those galaxies emit,

447
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
even traveling at the fastest speed, the speed of light,

448
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
will not be able to overcome

449
0:18:37.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
the ever-widening gulf between us.

450
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
So astronomers in the far future

451
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
looking out into deep space

452
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:47,000
will see nothing but an endless stretch

453
0:18:47.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
of static, inky, black stillness.

454
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
And they will conclude

455
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
that the universe is static and unchanging

456
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
and populated by a single central oasis of matter

457
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:,000
that they inhabit --

458
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
a picture of the cosmos

459
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:05,000
that we definitively know to be wrong.

460
0:19:05.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
Now maybe those future astronomers will have records

461
0:19:08.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
handed down from an earlier era,

462
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
like ours,

463
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:14,000
attesting to an expanding cosmos

464
0:19:14.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
teeming with galaxies.

465
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
But would those future astronomers

466
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:21,000
believe such ancient knowledge?

467
0:19:21.26,000 --> 0:19:23,000
Or would they believe

468
0:19:23.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
in the black, static empty universe

469
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
that their own state-of-the-art observations reveal?

470
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:32,000
I suspect the latter.

471
0:19:32.26,000 --> 0:19:34,000
Which means that we are living

472
0:19:34.26,000 --> 0:19:37,000
through a remarkably privileged era

473
0:19:37.26,000 --> 0:19:39,000
when certain deep truths about the cosmos

474
0:19:39.26,000 --> 0:19:41,000
are still within reach

475
0:19:41.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
of the human spirit of exploration.

476
0:19:43.26,000 --> 0:19:48,000
It appears that it may not always be that way.

477
0:19:48.26,000 --> 0:19:5,000
Because today's astronomers,

478
0:19:50.26,000 --> 0:19:53,000
by turning powerful telescopes to the sky,

479
0:19:53.26,000 --> 0:19:56,000
have captured a handful of starkly informative photons --

480
0:19:56.26,000 --> 0:19:59,000
a kind of cosmic telegram

481
0:19:59.26,000 --> 0:20:01,000
billions of years in transit.

482
0:20:01.26,000 --> 0:20:05,000
and the message echoing across the ages is clear.

483
0:20:05.26,000 --> 0:20:08,000
Sometimes nature guards her secrets

484
0:20:08.26,000 --> 0:20:1,000
with the unbreakable grip

485
0:20:10.26,000 --> 0:20:12,000
of physical law.

486
0:20:12.26,000 --> 0:20:16,000
Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons

487
0:20:16.26,000 --> 0:20:19,000
from just beyond the horizon.

488
0:20:19.26,000 --> 0:20:21,000
Thank you very much.

489
0:20:21.26,000 --> 0:20:25,000
(Applause)

490
0:20:25.26,000 --> 0:20:27,000
Chris Anderson: Brian, thank you.

491
0:20:27.26,000 --> 0:20:29,000
The range of ideas you've just spoken about

492
0:20:29.26,000 --> 0:20:32,000
are dizzying, exhilarating, incredible.

493
0:20:32.26,000 --> 0:20:34,000
How do you think

494
0:20:34.26,000 --> 0:20:36,000
of where cosmology is now,

495
0:20:36.26,000 --> 0:20:38,000
in a sort of historical side?

496
0:20:38.26,000 --> 0:20:41,000
Are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion?

497
0:20:41.26,000 --> 0:20:43,000
BG: Well it's hard to say.

498
0:20:43.26,000 --> 0:20:46,000
When we learn that astronomers of the far future

499
0:20:46.26,000 --> 0:20:49,000
may not have enough information to figure things out,

500
0:20:49.26,000 --> 0:20:52,000
the natural question is, maybe we're already in that position

501
0:20:52.26,000 --> 0:20:55,000
and certain deep, critical features of the universe

502
0:20:55.26,000 --> 0:20:58,000
already have escaped our ability to understand

503
0:20:58.26,000 --> 0:21:,000
because of how cosmology evolves.

504
0:21:00.26,000 --> 0:21:02,000
So from that perspective,

505
0:21:02.26,000 --> 0:21:04,000
maybe we will always be asking questions

506
0:21:04.26,000 --> 0:21:06,000
and never be able to fully answer them.

507
0:21:06.26,000 --> 0:21:08,000
On the other hand, we now can understand

508
0:21:08.26,000 --> 0:21:1,000
how old the universe is.

509
0:21:10.26,000 --> 0:21:12,000
We can understand

510
0:21:12.26,000 --> 0:21:15,000
how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation

511
0:21:15.26,000 --> 0:21:18,000
that was set down 13.72 billion years ago --

512
0:21:18.26,000 --> 0:21:2,000
and yet, we can do calculations today to predict how it will look

513
0:21:20.26,000 --> 0:21:22,000
and it matches.

514
0:21:22.26,000 --> 0:21:24,000
Holy cow! That's just amazing.

515
0:21:24.26,000 --> 0:21:27,000
So on the one hand, it's just incredible where we've gotten,

516
0:21:27.26,000 --> 0:21:31,000
but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future.

517
0:21:31.26,000 --> 0:21:34,000
CA: You're going to be around for the next few days.

518
0:21:34.26,000 --> 0:21:36,000
Maybe some of these conversations can continue.

519
0:21:36.26,000 --> 0:21:38,000
Thank you. Thank you, Brian. (BG: My pleasure.)

520
0:21:38.26,000 --> 0:21:41,000

2
0:00:15.871,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I have the answer to a question that we've all asked.

3
0:00:19.472,000 --> 0:00:2,000
The question is,

4
0:00:20.589,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Why is it that the letter X

5
0:00:22.873,000 --> 0:00:23,000
represents the unknown?

6
0:00:24.871,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Now I know we learned that in math class,

7
0:00:27.838,000 --> 0:00:28,000
but now it's everywhere in the culture --

8
0:00:29.589,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The X prize, the X-Files,

9
0:00:32.39,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Project X, TEDx.

10
0:00:36.313,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Where'd that come from?

11
0:00:38.308,000 --> 0:00:39,000
About six years ago

12
0:00:39.526,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I decided that I would learn Arabic,

13
0:00:42.242,000 --> 0:00:45,000
which turns out to be a supremely logical language.

14
0:00:46.194,000 --> 0:00:48,000
To write a word or a phrase

15
0:00:48.511,000 --> 0:00:49,000
or a sentence in Arabic

16
0:00:50.192,000 --> 0:00:52,000
is like crafting an equation,

17
0:00:52.425,000 --> 0:00:54,000
because every part is extremely precise

18
0:00:54.791,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and carries a lot of information.

19
0:00:57.643,000 --> 0:00:58,000
That's one of the reasons

20
0:00:58.993,000 --> 0:00:59,000
so much of what we've come to think of

21
0:01:00.508,000 --> 0:01:03,000
as Western science and mathematics and engineering

22
0:01:04.327,000 --> 0:01:07,000
was really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era

23
0:01:07.649,000 --> 0:01:1,000
by the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks.

24
0:01:10.965,000 --> 0:01:12,000
This includes the little system in Arabic

25
0:01:13.282,000 --> 0:01:14,000
called al-jebra.

26
0:01:14.998,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And al-jebr roughly translates to

27
0:01:18.166,000 --> 0:01:21,000
"the system for reconciling disparate parts."

28
0:01:21.865,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Al-jebr finally came into English as algebra.

29
0:01:25.915,000 --> 0:01:27,000
One example among many.

30
0:01:28.082,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The Arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom

31
0:01:32.048,000 --> 0:01:33,000
finally made their way to Europe --

32
0:01:33.831,000 --> 0:01:34,000
which is to say Spain --

33
0:01:35.117,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in the 11th and 12th centuries.

34
0:01:37.582,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And when they arrived

35
0:01:38.732,000 --> 0:01:39,000
there was tremendous interest

36
0:01:40.615,000 --> 0:01:41,000
in translating this wisdom

37
0:01:42.349,000 --> 0:01:43,000
into a European language.

38
0:01:43.998,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But there were problems.

39
0:01:46.016,000 --> 0:01:47,000
One problem

40
0:01:47.733,000 --> 0:01:49,000
is there are some sounds in Arabic

41
0:01:50.366,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that just don't make it through a European voice box

42
0:01:53.365,000 --> 0:01:55,000
without lots of practice.

43
0:01:55.632,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Trust me on that one.

44
0:01:57.366,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Also, those very sounds

45
0:01:59.583,000 --> 0:02:,000
tend not to be represented

46
0:02:01.497,000 --> 0:02:04,000
by the characters that are available in European languages.

47
0:02:05.085,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Here's one of the culprits.

48
0:02:06.899,000 --> 0:02:07,000
This is the letter sheen,

49
0:02:08.783,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and it makes the sound we think of as SH -- "sh."

50
0:02:12.382,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's also the very first letter

51
0:02:14.984,000 --> 0:02:16,000
of the word shayun,

52
0:02:17.416,000 --> 0:02:18,000
which means "something"

53
0:02:19.21,000 --> 0:02:2,000
just like the the English word "something" --

54
0:02:21.058,000 --> 0:02:24,000
some undefined, unknown thing.

55
0:02:24.344,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Now in Arabic,

56
0:02:25.509,000 --> 0:02:26,000
we can make this definite

57
0:02:26.71,000 --> 0:02:28,000
by adding the definite article "al."

58
0:02:28.858,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So this is al-shayun --

59
0:02:31.46,000 --> 0:02:32,000
the unknown thing.

60
0:02:33.11,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics,

61
0:02:36.413,000 --> 0:02:43,000
such as this 10th-century derivation of roots.

62
0:02:43.613,000 --> 0:02:45,000
The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars

63
0:02:46.123,000 --> 0:02:48,000
who were tasked with translating this material

64
0:02:48.691,000 --> 0:02:52,000
is that the letter sheen and the word shayun

65
0:02:53.173,000 --> 0:02:54,000
can't be rendered into Spanish

66
0:02:55.123,000 --> 0:02:57,000
because Spanish doesn't have that SH,

67
0:02:57.709,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that "sh" sound.

68
0:02:59.006,000 --> 0:03:,000
So by convention,

69
0:03:00.588,000 --> 0:03:01,000
they created a rule in which

70
0:03:02.254,000 --> 0:03:06,000
they borrowed the CK sound, "ck" sound,

71
0:03:06.472,000 --> 0:03:07,000
from the classical Greek

72
0:03:08.22,000 --> 0:03:1,000
in the form of the letter Kai.

73
0:03:10.901,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Later when this material was translated

74
0:03:13.62,000 --> 0:03:15,000
into a common European language,

75
0:03:15.968,000 --> 0:03:17,000
which is to say Latin,

76
0:03:18.018,000 --> 0:03:2,000
they simply replaced the Greek Kai

77
0:03:20.051,000 --> 0:03:22,000
with the Latin X.

78
0:03:22.401,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And once that happened,

79
0:03:23.67,000 --> 0:03:25,000
once this material was in Latin,

80
0:03:26.135,000 --> 0:03:29,000
it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks

81
0:03:29.718,000 --> 0:03:31,000
for almost 600 years.

82
0:03:31.801,000 --> 0:03:33,000
But now we have the answer to our question.

83
0:03:33.819,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Why is it that X is the unknown?

84
0:03:36.6,000 --> 0:03:37,000
X is the unknown

85
0:03:38.423,000 --> 0:03:41,000
because you can't say "sh" in Spanish.

86
0:03:42.205,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

87
0:03:44.589,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And I thought that was worth sharing.

88
0:03:46.906,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Applause)

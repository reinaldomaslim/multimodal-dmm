0:00:12.053,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I will lend books to people, but of course, the rule is

3
0:00:14.893,000 --> 0:00:18,000
"Don't do that unless you never intend to see that book again."

4
0:00:19.18,000 --> 0:00:2,000
[Small thing.]

5
0:00:20.355,000 --> 0:00:21,000
[Big idea.]

6
0:00:24.931,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The physical object of a book is almost like a person.

7
0:00:28.593,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I mean, it has a spine and it has a backbone.

8
0:00:30.793,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It has a face.

9
0:00:32.213,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Actually, it can sort of be your friend.

10
0:00:34.753,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Books record the basic human experience

11
0:00:37.943,000 --> 0:00:38,000
like no other medium can.

12
0:00:39.883,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Before there were books,

13
0:00:41.413,000 --> 0:00:43,000
ancient civilizations would record things

14
0:00:44.023,000 --> 0:00:47,000
by notches on bones or rocks or what have you.

15
0:00:47.633,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The first books as we know them originated in ancient Rome.

16
0:00:52.323,000 --> 0:00:53,000
We go by a term called the codex,

17
0:00:54.293,000 --> 0:00:56,000
where they would have two heavy pieces of wood

18
0:00:56.693,000 --> 0:00:57,000
which become the cover,

19
0:00:57.964,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and then the pages in between would then be stitched along one side

20
0:01:02.303,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to make something that was relatively easily transportable.

21
0:01:06.223,000 --> 0:01:08,000
They all had to completely be done by hand,

22
0:01:08.673,000 --> 0:01:1,000
which became the work of what we know as a scribe.

23
0:01:11.423,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And frankly, they were luxury items.

24
0:01:14.633,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And then a printer named Johannes Gutenberg,

25
0:01:18.093,000 --> 0:01:23,000
in the mid-fifteenth century, created the means to mass-produce a book,

26
0:01:23.787,000 --> 0:01:24,000
the modern printing press.

27
0:01:25.473,000 --> 0:01:26,000
It wasn't until then

28
0:01:26.787,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that there was any kind of consumption of books by a large audience.

29
0:01:31.293,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Book covers started to come into use in the early nineteenth century,

30
0:01:36.293,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and they were called dust wrappers.

31
0:01:38.693,000 --> 0:01:4,000
They usually had advertising on them.

32
0:01:40.863,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So people would take them off and throw them away.

33
0:01:43.343,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It wasn't until the turn of the nineteenth into the twentieth century

34
0:01:47.247,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that book jackets could be seen as interesting design

35
0:01:51.892,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in and of themselves.

36
0:01:53.503,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Such that I look at that and I think,

37
0:01:55.983,000 --> 0:01:56,000
"I want to read that.

38
0:01:57.513,000 --> 0:01:58,000
That interests me."

39
0:01:59.203,000 --> 0:02:03,000
The physical book itself represents both a technological advance

40
0:02:03.451,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but also a piece of technology in and of itself.

41
0:02:06.333,000 --> 0:02:08,000
It delivered a user interface

42
0:02:09.143,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that was unlike anything that people had before.

43
0:02:12.833,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And you could argue that it's still the best way

44
0:02:16.103,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to deliver that to an audience.

45
0:02:18.517,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I believe that the core purpose of a physical book

46
0:02:22.133,000 --> 0:02:25,000
is to record our existence

47
0:02:25.233,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and to leave it behind on a shelf, in a library, in a home,

48
0:02:30.73,000 --> 0:02:35,000
for generations down the road to understand where they came from,

49
0:02:35.943,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that people went through some of the same things

50
0:02:39.383,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that they're going through,

51
0:02:40.723,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and it's like a dialogue that you have with the author.

52
0:02:43.957,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I think you have a much more human relationship to a printed book

53
0:02:47.839,000 --> 0:02:49,000
than you do to one that's on a screen.

54
0:02:50.763,000 --> 0:02:53,000
People want the experience of holding it,

55
0:02:54.443,000 --> 0:02:58,000
of turning the page, of marking their progress in a story.

56
0:02:58.753,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And then you have, of all things, the smell of a book.

57
0:03:02.329,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Fresh ink on paper or the aging paper smell.

58
0:03:06.513,000 --> 0:03:08,000
You don't really get that from anything else.

59
0:03:09.023,000 --> 0:03:13,000
The book itself, you know, can't be turned off with a switch.

60
0:03:13.083,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It's a story that you can hold in your hand

61
0:03:15.933,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and carry around with you

62
0:03:17.32,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and that's part of what makes them so valuable,

63
0:03:20.473,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and I think will make them valuable for the duration.

64
0:03:25.293,000 --> 0:03:26,000
A shelf of books, frankly,

65
0:03:26.586,000 --> 0:03:27,000
is made to outlast you, (Laughs)

66
0:03:28.483,000 --> 0:03:29,000
no matter who you are.

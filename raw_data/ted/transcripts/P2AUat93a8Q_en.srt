1
0:00:12.928,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Why do we cheat?

2
0:00:16.42,000 --> 0:00:18,000
And why do happy people cheat?

3
0:00:20.641,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And when we say "infidelity," what exactly do we mean?

4
0:00:26.207,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Is it a hookup, a love story, paid sex, a chat room,

5
0:00:32.586,000 --> 0:00:34,000
a massage with a happy ending?

6
0:00:36.356,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Why do we think that men cheat out of boredom and fear of intimacy,

7
0:00:41.494,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but women cheat out of loneliness and hunger for intimacy?

8
0:00:47.769,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And is an affair always the end of a relationship?

9
0:00:53.294,000 --> 0:00:56,000
For the past 10 years, I have traveled the globe

10
0:00:56.49,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and worked extensively with hundreds of couples

11
0:00:59.535,000 --> 0:01:01,000
who have been shattered by infidelity.

12
0:01:02.999,000 --> 0:01:05,000
There is one simple act of transgression

13
0:01:06.641,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that can rob a couple of their relationship,

14
0:01:11.015,000 --> 0:01:15,000
their happiness and their very identity: an affair.

15
0:01:15.903,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And yet, this extremely common act is so poorly understood.

16
0:01:22.593,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So this talk is for anyone who has ever loved.

17
0:01:29.681,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Adultery has existed since marriage was invented,

18
0:01:33.525,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and so, too, the taboo against it.

19
0:01:37.094,000 --> 0:01:42,000
In fact, infidelity has a tenacity that marriage can only envy,

20
0:01:42.827,000 --> 0:01:45,000
so much so, that this is the only commandment

21
0:01:46.289,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that is repeated twice in the Bible:

22
0:01:50.221,000 --> 0:01:54,000
once for doing it, and once just for thinking about it.

23
0:01:54.349,000 --> 0:01:56,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:56.619,000 --> 0:02:,000
So how do we reconcile what is universally forbidden,

25
0:02:00.922,000 --> 0:02:02,000
yet universally practiced?

26
0:02:05.058,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Now, throughout history, men practically had a license to cheat

27
0:02:10.036,000 --> 0:02:12,000
with little consequence,

28
0:02:12.331,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and supported by a host of biological and evolutionary theories

29
0:02:16.739,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that justified their need to roam,

30
0:02:19.315,000 --> 0:02:22,000
so the double standard is as old as adultery itself.

31
0:02:24.403,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But who knows what's really going on under the sheets there, right?

32
0:02:29.92,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Because when it comes to sex,

33
0:02:31.776,000 --> 0:02:35,000
the pressure for men is to boast and to exaggerate,

34
0:02:35.939,000 --> 0:02:4,000
but the pressure for women is to hide, minimize and deny,

35
0:02:41.484,000 --> 0:02:45,000
which isn't surprising when you consider that there are still nine countries

36
0:02:45.71,000 --> 0:02:47,000
where women can be killed for straying.

37
0:02:49.825,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Now, monogamy used to be one person for life.

38
0:02:54.912,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Today, monogamy is one person at a time.

39
0:02:58.268,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Laughter)

40
0:03:00.158,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Applause)

41
0:03:04.364,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I mean, many of you probably have said,

42
0:03:06.3,000 --> 0:03:08,000
"I am monogamous in all my relationships."

43
0:03:09.46,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Laughter)

44
0:03:12.617,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We used to marry,

45
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and had sex for the first time.

46
0:03:16.614,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But now we marry,

47
0:03:18.076,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and we stop having sex with others.

48
0:03:21.455,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The fact is that monogamy had nothing to do with love.

49
0:03:26.332,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Men relied on women's fidelity

50
0:03:28.919,000 --> 0:03:31,000
in order to know whose children these are,

51
0:03:31.959,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and who gets the cows when I die.

52
0:03:36.205,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now, everyone wants to know

53
0:03:38.655,000 --> 0:03:39,000
what percentage of people cheat.

54
0:03:40.403,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I've been asked that question since I arrived at this conference.

55
0:03:43.658,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

56
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It applies to you.

57
0:03:48.466,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But the definition of infidelity keeps on expanding:

58
0:03:52.959,000 --> 0:03:57,000
sexting, watching porn, staying secretly active on dating apps.

59
0:03:58.332,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So because there is no universally agreed-upon definition

60
0:04:02.817,000 --> 0:04:05,000
of what even constitutes an infidelity,

61
0:04:05.956,000 --> 0:04:1,000
estimates vary widely, from 26 percent to 75 percent.

62
0:04:12.728,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But on top of it, we are walking contradictions.

63
0:04:16.173,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So 95 percent of us will say that it is terribly wrong

64
0:04:19.792,000 --> 0:04:22,000
for our partner to lie about having an affair,

65
0:04:22.969,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but just about the same amount of us will say

66
0:04:25.214,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that that's exactly what we would do if we were having one.

67
0:04:28.372,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

68
0:04:31.872,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Now, I like this definition of an affair --

69
0:04:35.577,000 --> 0:04:38,000
it brings together the three key elements:

70
0:04:39.326,000 --> 0:04:44,000
a secretive relationship, which is the core structure of an affair;

71
0:04:45.032,000 --> 0:04:49,000
an emotional connection to one degree or another;

72
0:04:49.826,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and a sexual alchemy.

73
0:04:52.355,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And alchemy is the key word here,

74
0:04:55.337,000 --> 0:05:01,000
because the erotic frisson is such that the kiss that you only imagine giving,

75
0:05:02.265,000 --> 0:05:05,000
can be as powerful and as enchanting

76
0:05:05.349,000 --> 0:05:07,000
as hours of actual lovemaking.

77
0:05:09.759,000 --> 0:05:1,000
As Marcel Proust said,

78
0:05:11.34,000 --> 0:05:16,000
it's our imagination that is responsible for love, not the other person.

79
0:05:17.902,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So it's never been easier to cheat,

80
0:05:21.762,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and it's never been more difficult to keep a secret.

81
0:05:25.999,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And never has infidelity exacted such a psychological toll.

82
0:05:31.975,000 --> 0:05:34,000
When marriage was an economic enterprise,

83
0:05:35.342,000 --> 0:05:37,000
infidelity threatened our economic security.

84
0:05:39.083,000 --> 0:05:41,000
But now that marriage is a romantic arrangement,

85
0:05:41.959,000 --> 0:05:44,000
infidelity threatens our emotional security.

86
0:05:45.779,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Ironically, we used to turn to adultery --

87
0:05:50.04,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that was the space where we sought pure love.

88
0:05:53.293,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But now that we seek love in marriage,

89
0:05:55.482,000 --> 0:05:56,000
adultery destroys it.

90
0:05:58.943,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Now, there are three ways that I think infidelity hurts differently today.

91
0:06:05.8,000 --> 0:06:1,000
We have a romantic ideal in which we turn to one person

92
0:06:11.613,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to fulfill an endless list of needs:

93
0:06:14.81,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to be my greatest lover, my best friend,

94
0:06:18.41,000 --> 0:06:21,000
the best parent, my trusted confidant,

95
0:06:21.563,000 --> 0:06:24,000
my emotional companion, my intellectual equal.

96
0:06:25.625,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And I am it: I'm chosen, I'm unique,

97
0:06:29.929,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I'm indispensable, I'm irreplaceable,

98
0:06:33.245,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I'm the one.

99
0:06:35.356,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And infidelity tells me I'm not.

100
0:06:39.308,000 --> 0:06:4,000
It is the ultimate betrayal.

101
0:06:41.999,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Infidelity shatters the grand ambition of love.

102
0:06:46.68,000 --> 0:06:5,000
But if throughout history, infidelity has always been painful,

103
0:06:51.561,000 --> 0:06:53,000
today it is often traumatic,

104
0:06:53.919,000 --> 0:06:55,000
because it threatens our sense of self.

105
0:06:57.054,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So my patient Fernando, he's plagued.

106
0:06:59.847,000 --> 0:07:01,000
He goes on: "I thought I knew my life.

107
0:07:02.595,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I thought I knew who you were, who we were as a couple, who I was.

108
0:07:06.801,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Now, I question everything."

109
0:07:09.632,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Infidelity -- a violation of trust, a crisis of identity.

110
0:07:14.819,000 --> 0:07:16,000
"Can I ever trust you again?" he asks.

111
0:07:17.148,000 --> 0:07:19,000
"Can I ever trust anyone again?"

112
0:07:20.824,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And this is also what my patient Heather is telling me,

113
0:07:23.905,000 --> 0:07:25,000
when she's talking to me about her story with Nick.

114
0:07:26.532,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Married, two kids.

115
0:07:27.982,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Nick just left on a business trip,

116
0:07:30.659,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and Heather is playing on his iPad with the boys,

117
0:07:34.19,000 --> 0:07:36,000
when she sees a message appear on the screen:

118
0:07:37.127,000 --> 0:07:38,000
"Can't wait to see you."

119
0:07:39.625,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Strange, she thinks, we just saw each other.

120
0:07:42.863,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And then another message:

121
0:07:44.903,000 --> 0:07:46,000
"Can't wait to hold you in my arms."

122
0:07:47.999,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And Heather realizes

123
0:07:50.243,000 --> 0:07:51,000
these are not for her.

124
0:07:52.435,000 --> 0:07:55,000
She also tells me that her father had affairs,

125
0:07:55.812,000 --> 0:07:58,000
but her mother, she found one little receipt in the pocket,

126
0:07:59.777,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and a little bit of lipstick on the collar.

127
0:08:03.221,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Heather, she goes digging,

128
0:08:06.61,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and she finds hundreds of messages,

129
0:08:09.673,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and photos exchanged and desires expressed.

130
0:08:13.42,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The vivid details of Nick's two-year affair

131
0:08:16.118,000 --> 0:08:19,000
unfold in front of her in real time,

132
0:08:19.999,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And it made me think:

133
0:08:21.272,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Affairs in the digital age are death by a thousand cuts.

134
0:08:27.854,000 --> 0:08:3,000
But then we have another paradox that we're dealing with these days.

135
0:08:31.113,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Because of this romantic ideal,

136
0:08:33.417,000 --> 0:08:38,000
we are relying on our partner's fidelity with a unique fervor.

137
0:08:38.999,000 --> 0:08:41,000
But we also have never been more inclined to stray,

138
0:08:42.544,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and not because we have new desires today,

139
0:08:45.255,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but because we live in an era

140
0:08:47.001,000 --> 0:08:5,000
where we feel that we are entitled to pursue our desires,

141
0:08:50.682,000 --> 0:08:53,000
because this is the culture where I deserve to be happy.

142
0:08:55.268,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And if we used to divorce because we were unhappy,

143
0:08:59.035,000 --> 0:09:01,000
today we divorce because we could be happier.

144
0:09:03.562,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And if divorce carried all the shame,

145
0:09:06.847,000 --> 0:09:09,000
today, choosing to stay when you can leave

146
0:09:10.738,000 --> 0:09:11,000
is the new shame.

147
0:09:12.657,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So Heather, she can't talk to her friends

148
0:09:15.168,000 --> 0:09:18,000
because she's afraid that they will judge her for still loving Nick,

149
0:09:18.429,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and everywhere she turns, she gets the same advice:

150
0:09:21.977,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Leave him. Throw the dog on the curb.

151
0:09:25.744,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And if the situation were reversed, Nick would be in the same situation.

152
0:09:31.07,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Staying is the new shame.

153
0:09:35.395,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So if we can divorce,

154
0:09:38.359,000 --> 0:09:4,000
why do we still have affairs?

155
0:09:41.999,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Now, the typical assumption is that if someone cheats,

156
0:09:46.563,000 --> 0:09:49,000
either there's something wrong in your relationship or wrong with you.

157
0:09:51.44,000 --> 0:09:54,000
But millions of people can't all be pathological.

158
0:09:56.383,000 --> 0:09:59,000
The logic goes like this: If you have everything you need at home,

159
0:10:00.291,000 --> 0:10:03,000
then there is no need to go looking elsewhere,

160
0:10:03.715,000 --> 0:10:06,000
assuming that there is such a thing as a perfect marriage

161
0:10:07.187,000 --> 0:10:09,000
that will inoculate us against wanderlust.

162
0:10:11.165,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But what if passion has a finite shelf life?

163
0:10:15.624,000 --> 0:10:18,000
What if there are things that even a good relationship

164
0:10:19.338,000 --> 0:10:2,000
can never provide?

165
0:10:22.187,000 --> 0:10:25,000
If even happy people cheat,

166
0:10:25.202,000 --> 0:10:26,000
what is it about?

167
0:10:28.765,000 --> 0:10:3,000
The vast majority of people that I actually work with

168
0:10:31.641,000 --> 0:10:33,000
are not at all chronic philanderers.

169
0:10:34.429,000 --> 0:10:38,000
They are often people who are deeply monogamous in their beliefs,

170
0:10:38.475,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and at least for their partner.

171
0:10:40.865,000 --> 0:10:42,000
But they find themselves in a conflict

172
0:10:43.501,000 --> 0:10:46,000
between their values and their behavior.

173
0:10:47.572,000 --> 0:10:51,000
They often are people who have actually been faithful for decades,

174
0:10:51.935,000 --> 0:10:53,000
but one day they cross a line

175
0:10:54.574,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that they never thought they would cross,

176
0:10:57.047,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and at the risk of losing everything.

177
0:11:00.73,000 --> 0:11:01,000
But for a glimmer of what?

178
0:11:03.969,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Affairs are an act of betrayal,

179
0:11:06.609,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and they are also an expression of longing and loss.

180
0:11:10.61,000 --> 0:11:13,000
At the heart of an affair, you will often find

181
0:11:14.528,000 --> 0:11:18,000
a longing and a yearning for an emotional connection,

182
0:11:18.789,000 --> 0:11:23,000
for novelty, for freedom, for autonomy, for sexual intensity,

183
0:11:24.559,000 --> 0:11:27,000
a wish to recapture lost parts of ourselves

184
0:11:28.226,000 --> 0:11:33,000
or an attempt to bring back vitality in the face of loss and tragedy.

185
0:11:34.849,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I'm thinking about another patient of mine, Priya,

186
0:11:37.766,000 --> 0:11:39,000
who is blissfully married,

187
0:11:40.382,000 --> 0:11:41,000
loves her husband,

188
0:11:41.847,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and would never want to hurt the man.

189
0:11:44.713,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But she also tells me

190
0:11:46.831,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that she's always done what was expected of her:

191
0:11:50.005,000 --> 0:11:53,000
good girl, good wife, good mother,

192
0:11:53.685,000 --> 0:11:55,000
taking care of her immigrant parents.

193
0:11:56.677,000 --> 0:12:,000
Priya, she fell for the arborist who removed the tree from her yard

194
0:12:01.214,000 --> 0:12:02,000
after Hurricane Sandy.

195
0:12:03.524,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And with his truck and his tattoos, he's quite the opposite of her.

196
0:12:09.547,000 --> 0:12:14,000
But at 47, Priya's affair is about the adolescence that she never had.

197
0:12:15.753,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And her story highlights for me that when we seek the gaze of another,

198
0:12:21.03,000 --> 0:12:25,000
it isn't always our partner that we are turning away from,

199
0:12:25.748,000 --> 0:12:27,000
but the person that we have ourselves become.

200
0:12:29.728,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And it isn't so much that we're looking for another person,

201
0:12:33.274,000 --> 0:12:36,000
as much as we are looking for another self.

202
0:12:39.045,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Now, all over the world,

203
0:12:40.602,000 --> 0:12:43,000
there is one word that people who have affairs always tell me.

204
0:12:45.03,000 --> 0:12:46,000
They feel alive.

205
0:12:48.046,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And they often will tell me stories of recent losses --

206
0:12:52.286,000 --> 0:12:53,000
of a parent who died,

207
0:12:54.141,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and a friend that went too soon,

208
0:12:56.341,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and bad news at the doctor.

209
0:12:59.482,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Death and mortality often live in the shadow of an affair,

210
0:13:04.138,000 --> 0:13:06,000
because they raise these questions.

211
0:13:06.632,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Is this it? Is there more?

212
0:13:09.901,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Am I going on for another 25 years like this?

213
0:13:13.87,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Will I ever feel that thing again?

214
0:13:18.377,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And it has led me to think that perhaps these questions

215
0:13:22.788,000 --> 0:13:25,000
are the ones that propel people to cross the line,

216
0:13:25.947,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and that some affairs are an attempt to beat back deadness,

217
0:13:29.939,000 --> 0:13:3,000
in an antidote to death.

218
0:13:33.999,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And contrary to what you may think,

219
0:13:36.867,000 --> 0:13:41,000
affairs are way less about sex, and a lot more about desire:

220
0:13:41.903,000 --> 0:13:44,000
desire for attention, desire to feel special,

221
0:13:45.392,000 --> 0:13:46,000
desire to feel important.

222
0:13:48.237,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And the very structure of an affair,

223
0:13:51.247,000 --> 0:13:53,000
the fact that you can never have your lover,

224
0:13:53.503,000 --> 0:13:54,000
keeps you wanting.

225
0:13:54.938,000 --> 0:13:57,000
That in itself is a desire machine,

226
0:13:57.959,000 --> 0:13:59,000
because the incompleteness, the ambiguity,

227
0:14:00.747,000 --> 0:14:02,000
keeps you wanting that which you can't have.

228
0:14:05.641,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Now some of you probably think

229
0:14:07.177,000 --> 0:14:1,000
that affairs don't happen in open relationships,

230
0:14:10.807,000 --> 0:14:11,000
but they do.

231
0:14:12.432,000 --> 0:14:15,000
First of all, the conversation about monogamy is not the same

232
0:14:15.562,000 --> 0:14:17,000
as the conversation about infidelity.

233
0:14:18.468,000 --> 0:14:21,000
But the fact is that it seems that even when we have

234
0:14:21.959,000 --> 0:14:23,000
the freedom to have other sexual partners,

235
0:14:24.632,000 --> 0:14:28,000
we still seem to be lured by the power of the forbidden,

236
0:14:28.72,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that if we do that which we are not supposed to do,

237
0:14:32.207,000 --> 0:14:34,000
then we feel like we are really doing what we want to.

238
0:14:37.331,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And I've also told quite a few of my patients

239
0:14:40.935,000 --> 0:14:44,000
that if they could bring into their relationships

240
0:14:45.536,000 --> 0:14:48,000
one tenth of the boldness, the imagination and the verve

241
0:14:49.167,000 --> 0:14:5,000
that they put into their affairs,

242
0:14:50.879,000 --> 0:14:52,000
they probably would never need to see me.

243
0:14:53.148,000 --> 0:14:55,000
(Laughter)

244
0:14:56.362,000 --> 0:14:58,000
So how do we heal from an affair?

245
0:15:00.428,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Desire runs deep.

246
0:15:02.371,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Betrayal runs deep.

247
0:15:05.266,000 --> 0:15:06,000
But it can be healed.

248
0:15:07.999,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And some affairs are death knells

249
0:15:10.944,000 --> 0:15:12,000
for relationships that were already dying on the vine.

250
0:15:14.753,000 --> 0:15:17,000
But others will jolt us into new possibilities.

251
0:15:17.953,000 --> 0:15:18,000
The fact is, the majority of couples

252
0:15:19.936,000 --> 0:15:21,000
who have experienced affairs stay together.

253
0:15:22.766,000 --> 0:15:24,000
But some of them will merely survive,

254
0:15:25.399,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and others will actually be able to turn a crisis into an opportunity.

255
0:15:30.817,000 --> 0:15:33,000
They'll be able to turn this into a generative experience.

256
0:15:34.484,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And I'm actually thinking even more so for the deceived partner,

257
0:15:38.222,000 --> 0:15:39,000
who will often say,

258
0:15:39.558,000 --> 0:15:4,000
"You think I didn't want more?

259
0:15:41.365,000 --> 0:15:42,000
But I'm not the one who did it."

260
0:15:43.968,000 --> 0:15:45,000
But now that the affair is exposed,

261
0:15:46.11,000 --> 0:15:48,000
they, too, get to claim more,

262
0:15:48.244,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and they no longer have to uphold the status quo

263
0:15:50.886,000 --> 0:15:52,000
that may not have been working for them that well, either.

264
0:15:56.221,000 --> 0:15:58,000
I've noticed that a lot of couples,

265
0:15:59.11,000 --> 0:16:01,000
in the immediate aftermath of an affair,

266
0:16:01.251,000 --> 0:16:05,000
because of this new disorder that may actually lead to a new order,

267
0:16:05.587,000 --> 0:16:08,000
will have depths of conversations with honesty and openness

268
0:16:09.169,000 --> 0:16:1,000
that they haven't had in decades.

269
0:16:11.743,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And, partners who were sexually indifferent

270
0:16:14.68,000 --> 0:16:16,000
find themselves suddenly so lustfully voracious,

271
0:16:17.279,000 --> 0:16:19,000
they don't know where it's coming from.

272
0:16:20.568,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Something about the fear of loss will rekindle desire,

273
0:16:24.521,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and make way for an entirely new kind of truth.

274
0:16:30.133,000 --> 0:16:32,000
So when an affair is exposed,

275
0:16:33.004,000 --> 0:16:36,000
what are some of the specific things that couples can do?

276
0:16:38.133,000 --> 0:16:42,000
We know from trauma that healing begins

277
0:16:42.204,000 --> 0:16:45,000
when the perpetrator acknowledges their wrongdoing.

278
0:16:47.339,000 --> 0:16:5,000
So for the partner who had the affair,

279
0:16:51.05,000 --> 0:16:52,000
for Nick,

280
0:16:52.582,000 --> 0:16:53,000
one thing is to end the affair,

281
0:16:54.387,000 --> 0:16:58,000
but the other is the essential, important act of expressing

282
0:16:59.109,000 --> 0:17:02,000
guilt and remorse for hurting his wife.

283
0:17:02.889,000 --> 0:17:03,000
But the truth is

284
0:17:04.264,000 --> 0:17:07,000
that I have noticed that quite a lot of people who have affairs

285
0:17:07.365,000 --> 0:17:1,000
may feel terribly guilty for hurting their partner,

286
0:17:10.463,000 --> 0:17:13,000
but they don't feel guilty for the experience of the affair itself.

287
0:17:14.135,000 --> 0:17:15,000
And that distinction is important.

288
0:17:17.23,000 --> 0:17:2,000
And Nick, he needs to hold vigil for the relationship.

289
0:17:21.253,000 --> 0:17:24,000
He needs to become, for a while, the protector of the boundaries.

290
0:17:24.326,000 --> 0:17:26,000
It's his responsibility to bring it up,

291
0:17:26.949,000 --> 0:17:27,000
because if he thinks about it,

292
0:17:28.929,000 --> 0:17:31,000
he can relieve Heather from the obsession,

293
0:17:31.939,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and from having to make sure that the affair isn't forgotten,

294
0:17:35.149,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and that in itself begins to restore trust.

295
0:17:39.57,000 --> 0:17:4,000
But for Heather,

296
0:17:41.429,000 --> 0:17:42,000
or deceived partners,

297
0:17:43.174,000 --> 0:17:48,000
it is essential to do things that bring back a sense of self-worth,

298
0:17:48.512,000 --> 0:17:51,000
to surround oneself with love and with friends and activities

299
0:17:52.249,000 --> 0:17:55,000
that give back joy and meaning and identity.

300
0:17:55.936,000 --> 0:17:56,000
But even more important,

301
0:17:57.869,000 --> 0:18:01,000
is to curb the curiosity to mine for the sordid details --

302
0:18:02.772,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Where were you? Where did you do it?

303
0:18:04.969,000 --> 0:18:07,000
How often? Is she better than me in bed? --

304
0:18:07.991,000 --> 0:18:09,000
questions that only inflict more pain,

305
0:18:10.475,000 --> 0:18:11,000
and keep you awake at night.

306
0:18:12.674,000 --> 0:18:16,000
And instead, switch to what I call the investigative questions,

307
0:18:17.35,000 --> 0:18:2,000
the ones that mine the meaning and the motives --

308
0:18:20.654,000 --> 0:18:22,000
What did this affair mean for you?

309
0:18:23.127,000 --> 0:18:25,000
What were you able to express or experience there

310
0:18:25.899,000 --> 0:18:27,000
that you could no longer do with me?

311
0:18:28.154,000 --> 0:18:31,000
What was it like for you when you came home?

312
0:18:31.186,000 --> 0:18:34,000
What is it about us that you value?

313
0:18:34.585,000 --> 0:18:36,000
Are you pleased this is over?

314
0:18:38.404,000 --> 0:18:42,000
Every affair will redefine a relationship,

315
0:18:42.725,000 --> 0:18:44,000
and every couple will determine

316
0:18:45.607,000 --> 0:18:47,000
what the legacy of the affair will be.

317
0:18:49.649,000 --> 0:18:52,000
But affairs are here to stay, and they're not going away.

318
0:18:54.316,000 --> 0:18:56,000
And the dilemmas of love and desire,

319
0:18:56.959,000 --> 0:19:01,000
they don't yield just simple answers of black and white and good and bad,

320
0:19:02.929,000 --> 0:19:03,000
and victim and perpetrator.

321
0:19:06.221,000 --> 0:19:1,000
Betrayal in a relationship comes in many forms.

322
0:19:10.296,000 --> 0:19:12,000
There are many ways that we betray our partner:

323
0:19:12.65,000 --> 0:19:14,000
with contempt, with neglect,

324
0:19:14.819,000 --> 0:19:16,000
with indifference, with violence.

325
0:19:17.999,000 --> 0:19:2,000
Sexual betrayal is only one way to hurt a partner.

326
0:19:21.437,000 --> 0:19:23,000
In other words, the victim of an affair

327
0:19:24.041,000 --> 0:19:26,000
is not always the victim of the marriage.

328
0:19:29.84,000 --> 0:19:31,000
Now, you've listened to me,

329
0:19:32.048,000 --> 0:19:34,000
and I know what you're thinking:

330
0:19:34.423,000 --> 0:19:37,000
She has a French accent, she must be pro-affair.

331
0:19:38.697,000 --> 0:19:41,000
(Laughter)

332
0:19:43.761,000 --> 0:19:44,000
So, you're wrong.

333
0:19:45.619,000 --> 0:19:46,000
I am not French.

334
0:19:47.666,000 --> 0:19:49,000
(Laughter)

335
0:19:50.143,000 --> 0:19:52,000
(Applause)

336
0:19:53.602,000 --> 0:19:54,000
And I'm not pro-affair.

337
0:19:56.674,000 --> 0:20:,000
But because I think that good can come out of an affair,

338
0:20:01.058,000 --> 0:20:04,000
I have often been asked this very strange question:

339
0:20:04.413,000 --> 0:20:05,000
Would I ever recommend it?

340
0:20:07.514,000 --> 0:20:09,000
Now, I would no more recommend you have an affair

341
0:20:10.505,000 --> 0:20:12,000
than I would recommend you have cancer,

342
0:20:13.049,000 --> 0:20:15,000
and yet we know that people who have been ill

343
0:20:15.752,000 --> 0:20:19,000
often talk about how their illness has yielded them a new perspective.

344
0:20:20.569,000 --> 0:20:23,000
The main question that I've been asked since I arrived at this conference

345
0:20:23.906,000 --> 0:20:26,000
when I said I would talk about infidelity is, for or against?

346
0:20:28.488,000 --> 0:20:29,000
I said, "Yes."

347
0:20:30.162,000 --> 0:20:32,000
(Laughter)

348
0:20:33.868,000 --> 0:20:36,000
I look at affairs from a dual perspective:

349
0:20:37.505,000 --> 0:20:4,000
hurt and betrayal on one side,

350
0:20:41.153,000 --> 0:20:44,000
growth and self-discovery on the other --

351
0:20:44.509,000 --> 0:20:47,000
what it did to you, and what it meant for me.

352
0:20:48.621,000 --> 0:20:52,000
And so when a couple comes to me in the aftermath of an affair

353
0:20:53.289,000 --> 0:20:54,000
that has been revealed,

354
0:20:55.092,000 --> 0:20:57,000
I will often tell them this:

355
0:20:57.42,000 --> 0:20:59,000
Today in the West,

356
0:20:59.825,000 --> 0:21:03,000
most of us are going to have two or three relationships

357
0:21:04.704,000 --> 0:21:05,000
or marriages,

358
0:21:06.403,000 --> 0:21:09,000
and some of us are going to do it with the same person.

359
0:21:10.666,000 --> 0:21:12,000
Your first marriage is over.

360
0:21:13.633,000 --> 0:21:15,000
Would you like to create a second one together?

361
0:21:17.164,000 --> 0:21:18,000
Thank you.

362
0:21:18.619,000 --> 0:21:24,000
(Applause)

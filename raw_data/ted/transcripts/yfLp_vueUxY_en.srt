1
0:00:13.143,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm going to tell you a story.

2
0:00:16.048,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm going to tell you a story

3
0:00:17.463,000 --> 0:00:2,000
about how the deadliest consumer product imaginable

4
0:00:20.666,000 --> 0:00:21,000
came to be.

5
0:00:22.413,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's the cigarette.

6
0:00:24.572,000 --> 0:00:26,000
The cigarette is the only consumer product

7
0:00:27.128,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that, when used as intended,

8
0:00:29.691,000 --> 0:00:32,000
will kill half of all long-term users prematurely, later in life.

9
0:00:34.347,000 --> 0:00:35,000
But this is also a story

10
0:00:35.596,000 --> 0:00:38,000
about the work that we're doing at the Food and Drug Administration,

11
0:00:39.046,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and specifically, the work that we're doing

12
0:00:41.474,000 --> 0:00:44,000
to create the cigarette of the future,

13
0:00:44.649,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that is no longer capable of creating or sustaining addiction.

14
0:00:49.823,000 --> 0:00:52,000
A lot of people think that the tobacco problem or the smoking problem

15
0:00:53.546,000 --> 0:00:54,000
has been solved in the United States

16
0:00:55.308,000 --> 0:00:57,000
because of the great progress that's been made

17
0:00:57.498,000 --> 0:00:58,000
over the last 40, 50 years,

18
0:00:59.411,000 --> 0:01:01,000
when it comes to both consumption and prevalence.

19
0:01:02.278,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And it's true;

20
0:01:04.205,000 --> 0:01:07,000
smoking rates are at historic lows.

21
0:01:07.673,000 --> 0:01:09,000
It's true for both adults and for kids.

22
0:01:11.339,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And it's true that those who continue to smoke

23
0:01:14.149,000 --> 0:01:16,000
are smoking far fewer cigarettes per day

24
0:01:16.807,000 --> 0:01:17,000
than at any time in history.

25
0:01:20.035,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But what if I told you that tobacco use,

26
0:01:23.96,000 --> 0:01:26,000
primarily because of firsthand and secondhand exposure

27
0:01:27.292,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to the smoke in cigarettes,

28
0:01:30.03,000 --> 0:01:33,000
remains the leading cause of completely preventable disease and death

29
0:01:33.812,000 --> 0:01:34,000
in this country?

30
0:01:36.196,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Well, that's true.

31
0:01:38.988,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And what if I told you that it's actually killing more people

32
0:01:42.972,000 --> 0:01:44,000
than we thought to be the case ever before?

33
0:01:45.956,000 --> 0:01:46,000
That's true, too.

34
0:01:48.903,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Smoking kills more people each year than alcohol, AIDS, car accidents,

35
0:01:53.014,000 --> 0:01:56,000
illegal drugs, murders and suicides combined.

36
0:01:57.154,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Year in and year out.

37
0:01:59.979,000 --> 0:02:,000
In 2014,

38
0:02:03.177,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Dr. Adams's predecessor released

39
0:02:04.895,000 --> 0:02:06,000
the 50th anniversary Surgeon General's report

40
0:02:07.339,000 --> 0:02:08,000
on smoking and health.

41
0:02:10.133,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And that report upped the annual death toll from smoking,

42
0:02:13.887,000 --> 0:02:15,000
because the list of smoking-related illnesses

43
0:02:16.561,000 --> 0:02:17,000
got bigger.

44
0:02:18.066,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And so it is now conservatively estimated

45
0:02:20.284,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that smoking kills 480,000 Americans every year.

46
0:02:25.414,000 --> 0:02:27,000
These are completely preventable deaths.

47
0:02:28.811,000 --> 0:02:31,000
How do we wrap our heads around a statistic like this?

48
0:02:32.057,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So much of what we've heard at this conference

49
0:02:34.725,000 --> 0:02:38,000
is about individual experiences and personal experiences.

50
0:02:39.114,000 --> 0:02:41,000
How do we deal with this at a population level,

51
0:02:41.812,000 --> 0:02:43,000
when there are 480,000 moms,

52
0:02:44.807,000 --> 0:02:48,000
dads, sisters, brothers, aunts and uncles

53
0:02:49.371,000 --> 0:02:52,000
dying unnecessary deaths every year from tobacco?

54
0:02:54.329,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And then what happens when you think about this trajectory

55
0:02:57.448,000 --> 0:02:58,000
for the future?

56
0:02:59.274,000 --> 0:03:,000
And just do the simple math:

57
0:03:01.831,000 --> 0:03:05,000
from the time of the 50th anniversary Surgeon General's report five years ago,

58
0:03:06.522,000 --> 0:03:08,000
when this horrible statistic was raised,

59
0:03:09.244,000 --> 0:03:1,000
just through mid-century --

60
0:03:11.857,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that's more than 17 million avoidable deaths in the United States

61
0:03:17.371,000 --> 0:03:18,000
from tobacco use,

62
0:03:19.166,000 --> 0:03:2,000
primarily because of cigarettes.

63
0:03:21.855,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The Surgeon General concluded

64
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that 5.6 million children alive in the United States in 2014

65
0:03:31.309,000 --> 0:03:35,000
will die prematurely later in life because of cigarettes.

66
0:03:36.301,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Five point six million children.

67
0:03:39.783,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So this is an enormous public health problem for all of us

68
0:03:44.411,000 --> 0:03:46,000
but especially for us as regulators

69
0:03:46.732,000 --> 0:03:49,000
at the Food and Drug Administration and the Center for Tobacco Products.

70
0:03:50.411,000 --> 0:03:51,000
What can we do about it?

71
0:03:52.752,000 --> 0:03:56,000
What can we do to reverse this trajectory of disease and death?

72
0:03:58.942,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Well, we have an interesting guide to help unravel issues

73
0:04:04.741,000 --> 0:04:07,000
like: How did the cigarette as we know it come to be?

74
0:04:08.942,000 --> 0:04:12,000
What is the true nature of the tobacco and cigarette business?

75
0:04:13.65,000 --> 0:04:14,000
How did the industry behave

76
0:04:14.984,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in the historically unregulated marketplace?

77
0:04:18.325,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And our guide

78
0:04:20.071,000 --> 0:04:24,000
is previously secret internal documents from the tobacco industry.

79
0:04:25.015,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Come with me

80
0:04:26.896,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in a tobacco industry document time machine.

81
0:04:31.15,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Nineteen sixty-three

82
0:04:33.612,000 --> 0:04:38,000
was 25 years before the Surgeon General was finally able to conclude

83
0:04:39.289,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that the nicotine and cigarettes was addictive.

84
0:04:42.067,000 --> 0:04:46,000
That did not happen until the Surgeon General's report in 1998.

85
0:04:47.062,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Nineteen sixty-three

86
0:04:49.451,000 --> 0:04:54,000
was one year before the first-ever Surgeon General's report in 1964.

87
0:04:56.688,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I remember 1964.

88
0:04:58.807,000 --> 0:05:,000
I don't remember the Surgeon General's report,

89
0:05:00.99,000 --> 0:05:01,000
but I remember 1964.

90
0:05:02.625,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I was a kid growing up in Brooklyn, New York.

91
0:05:05.532,000 --> 0:05:06,000
This was at a time

92
0:05:07.246,000 --> 0:05:11,000
when almost one in two adults in the United States smoked.

93
0:05:12.094,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Both of my parents were heavy smokers at the time.

94
0:05:16.177,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Tobacco use was so incredibly normalized

95
0:05:19.39,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that -- and this wasn't North Carolina, Virginia or Kentucky,

96
0:05:22.344,000 --> 0:05:23,000
this was Brooklyn --

97
0:05:24.828,000 --> 0:05:27,000
we made ashtrays for our parents in arts and crafts class.

98
0:05:28.403,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Laughter)

99
0:05:31.97,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The ashtrays I made were pretty awful, but they were ashtrays.

100
0:05:34.907,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Laughter)

101
0:05:36.597,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So normalized that I remember seeing a bowl of loose cigarettes in the foyer

102
0:05:42.516,000 --> 0:05:44,000
of our house and other houses

103
0:05:44.794,000 --> 0:05:47,000
as a welcoming gesture when friends came over for a visit.

104
0:05:49.609,000 --> 0:05:52,000
OK, we're back in 1963.

105
0:05:53.204,000 --> 0:05:54,000
The top lawyer for Brown and Williamson,

106
0:05:55.196,000 --> 0:05:58,000
which was then the third-largest cigarette company in the United States,

107
0:05:58.58,000 --> 0:05:59,000
wrote the following:

108
0:05:59.811,000 --> 0:06:,000
"Nicotine is addictive.

109
0:06:01.025,000 --> 0:06:04,000
We are, then, in the business of selling nicotine -- an addictive drug."

110
0:06:05.184,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It's a remarkable statement,

111
0:06:06.548,000 --> 0:06:08,000
as much for what it doesn't say as for what it does say.

112
0:06:09.195,000 --> 0:06:11,000
He didn't say they were in the cigarette business.

113
0:06:11.584,000 --> 0:06:13,000
He didn't say they were in the tobacco business.

114
0:06:13.901,000 --> 0:06:15,000
He said they were in the business of selling nicotine.

115
0:06:17.267,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Philip Morris in 1972:

116
0:06:19.149,000 --> 0:06:2,000
"The cigarette isn't a product,

117
0:06:20.894,000 --> 0:06:21,000
it's a package.

118
0:06:22.712,000 --> 0:06:23,000
The product is nicotine.

119
0:06:24.768,000 --> 0:06:28,000
The pack is a storage container for a day's supply of nicotine.

120
0:06:28.88,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The cigarette, a dispenser for a dose unit of nicotine."

121
0:06:34.055,000 --> 0:06:36,000
We'll come back to this dose unit notion later.

122
0:06:37.906,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And R.J. Reynolds in 1972:

123
0:06:39.811,000 --> 0:06:42,000
"In a sense, the tobacco industry may be thought of as being a specialized,

124
0:06:43.374,000 --> 0:06:46,000
highly ritualized and stylized segment of the pharmaceutical industry.

125
0:06:47.144,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Tobacco products uniquely contain and deliver nicotine,

126
0:06:50.026,000 --> 0:06:53,000
a potent drug with a variety of physiological effects."

127
0:06:53.764,000 --> 0:06:56,000
At the time, and for many decades, publicly,

128
0:06:56.891,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the industry completely denied addiction

129
0:06:59.546,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and completely denied causality.

130
0:07:02.163,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But they knew the true nature of their business.

131
0:07:04.768,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And from time to time,

132
0:07:06.3,000 --> 0:07:09,000
there have been health scares made public about cigarettes,

133
0:07:09.965,000 --> 0:07:1,000
going back many decades.

134
0:07:11.989,000 --> 0:07:12,000
How did the industry respond?

135
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And how did they respond

136
0:07:15.553,000 --> 0:07:18,000
in this historically unregulated marketplace?

137
0:07:18.657,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Going back to the 1930s,

138
0:07:20.911,000 --> 0:07:25,000
it was with advertising that heavily featured imagery of doctors

139
0:07:26.014,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and other health care professionals

140
0:07:27.95,000 --> 0:07:29,000
sending messages of reassurance.

141
0:07:30.617,000 --> 0:07:31,000
This is an ad for Lucky Strikes,

142
0:07:32.276,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the popular cigarette of the time in the '30s:

143
0:07:34.712,000 --> 0:07:38,000
[20,679 physicians say "Luckies are less irritating."

144
0:07:39.322,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Your throat protection against irritation, against cough.]

145
0:07:43.548,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Laughter)

146
0:07:46.014,000 --> 0:07:47,000
We laugh,

147
0:07:47.895,000 --> 0:07:48,000
but this was the kind of advertising

148
0:07:49.665,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that was there to send a health message of reassurance.

149
0:07:52.68,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Fast-forward to 1950s, '60s and '70s.

150
0:07:56.22,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And here, again, in the absence of regulation,

151
0:07:59.196,000 --> 0:08:01,000
what we're going to see is modifications to the product

152
0:08:01.997,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and product design

153
0:08:03.719,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to respond to the health concerns of the day.

154
0:08:07.664,000 --> 0:08:1,000
This is the Kent Micronite filter.

155
0:08:11.117,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And here, the innovation, if you will, was the filtered cigarette.

156
0:08:16.395,000 --> 0:08:17,000
[Full smoking pleasure ...

157
0:08:18.101,000 --> 0:08:2,000
plus proof of the greatest health protection ever.]

158
0:08:22.244,000 --> 0:08:24,000
What the smoker of this product didn't know,

159
0:08:25.196,000 --> 0:08:26,000
what their doctor didn't know,

160
0:08:27.141,000 --> 0:08:29,000
what the government didn't know,

161
0:08:29.324,000 --> 0:08:32,000
is that this was a filter that was lined with asbestos --

162
0:08:32.844,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Gasps)

163
0:08:33.924,000 --> 0:08:35,000
so that when smokers were smoking this filtered cigarette

164
0:08:36.662,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and still inhaling the chemicals and smoke

165
0:08:39.202,000 --> 0:08:42,000
that we know are associated with cancer and lung disease

166
0:08:42.432,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and heart disease,

167
0:08:43.665,000 --> 0:08:45,000
they were also sucking down asbestos fibers.

168
0:08:46.112,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Gasps)

169
0:08:48.236,000 --> 0:08:5,000
In the 1960s and the 1970s,

170
0:08:50.815,000 --> 0:08:53,000
the so-called innovation was the light cigarette.

171
0:08:55.49,000 --> 0:08:58,000
This is a typical brand of the day called True.

172
0:08:59.477,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And this is after the Surgeon General's reports have started coming out.

173
0:09:02.938,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And you see the look of concern on her face.

174
0:09:05.271,000 --> 0:09:06,000
[Considering all I'd heard,

175
0:09:06.607,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I decided to either quit or smoke True.

176
0:09:09.427,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I smoke True.]

177
0:09:10.857,000 --> 0:09:11,000
(Laughter)

178
0:09:12.419,000 --> 0:09:14,000
[The low tar, low nicotine cigarette.]

179
0:09:15.385,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And then it says, "Think about it."

180
0:09:17.325,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And then even below that in the small print

181
0:09:20.627,000 --> 0:09:22,000
are tar numbers and nicotine numbers.

182
0:09:24.333,000 --> 0:09:26,000
What was a light cigarette?

183
0:09:27.474,000 --> 0:09:28,000
How did it work?

184
0:09:30.474,000 --> 0:09:32,000
This is an illustration of the product modification

185
0:09:33.196,000 --> 0:09:35,000
known as "filter ventilation."

186
0:09:36.128,000 --> 0:09:37,000
That's not a real filter blown up.

187
0:09:37.811,000 --> 0:09:38,000
That's just a picture

188
0:09:39.025,000 --> 0:09:42,000
so that you could see the rows of laser-perforated ventilation holes

189
0:09:42.255,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that were put on the filter.

190
0:09:43.635,000 --> 0:09:44,000
When you look at a real cigarette,

191
0:09:45.291,000 --> 0:09:46,000
it's harder to see.

192
0:09:46.831,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Every patent for this product shows

193
0:09:48.969,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that the ventilation holes should be 12 millimeters

194
0:09:52.395,000 --> 0:09:53,000
from the lip end of the filter.

195
0:09:54.188,000 --> 0:09:55,000
How did it work?

196
0:09:56.458,000 --> 0:09:58,000
The cigarette got stuck into a machine.

197
0:09:59.95,000 --> 0:10:01,000
The machine started puffing away on the cigarette

198
0:10:02.315,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and recording tar and nicotine levels.

199
0:10:05.061,000 --> 0:10:06,000
As the machine smoked,

200
0:10:06.815,000 --> 0:10:09,000
outside air came through those ventilation holes

201
0:10:10.284,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and diluted the amount of smoke that was coming through the cigarette.

202
0:10:14.22,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So as the machine smoked,

203
0:10:16.331,000 --> 0:10:18,000
there really was less tar and nicotine being delivered

204
0:10:18.898,000 --> 0:10:19,000
compared to a regular cigarette.

205
0:10:21.975,000 --> 0:10:22,000
What the tobacco industry knew

206
0:10:23.784,000 --> 0:10:26,000
was that human beings don't smoke like machines.

207
0:10:27.713,000 --> 0:10:29,000
How do human beings smoke this?

208
0:10:30.816,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Where do the fingers go?

209
0:10:32.44,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Murmurs)

210
0:10:33.704,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Where do the lips go?

211
0:10:35.474,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I told you that the patent said

212
0:10:36.99,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that the holes are 12 millimeters from the lip end.

213
0:10:40.038,000 --> 0:10:42,000
The smoker didn't even know they were there,

214
0:10:42.3,000 --> 0:10:45,000
but between fingers and lips, the holes get blocked.

215
0:10:46.505,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And when the holes get blocked, it's no longer a light cigarette.

216
0:10:50.807,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Turns out that there's actually

217
0:10:52.363,000 --> 0:10:54,000
basically as much nicotine inside a light cigarette

218
0:10:55.093,000 --> 0:10:56,000
as a regular cigarette.

219
0:10:56.323,000 --> 0:10:57,000
The difference was what's on the outside.

220
0:10:58.313,000 --> 0:11:01,000
But once you block what's on the outside,

221
0:11:01.583,000 --> 0:11:02,000
it's a regular cigarette.

222
0:11:04.821,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Congress put FDA in the business of regulating tobacco products

223
0:11:07.856,000 --> 0:11:08,000
10 years ago this June.

224
0:11:09.355,000 --> 0:11:11,000
So you heard the statistics at the beginning

225
0:11:11.704,000 --> 0:11:15,000
about the extraordinary contribution to disease and death that cigarettes make.

226
0:11:16.754,000 --> 0:11:18,000
We've also been paying a lot of attention

227
0:11:18.806,000 --> 0:11:21,000
to how the cigarette works as a drug-delivery device

228
0:11:22.69,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and the remarkable efficiency with which it delivers nicotine.

229
0:11:26.272,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So let's take a look.

230
0:11:28.844,000 --> 0:11:3,000
When the smoker puffs on the cigarette,

231
0:11:31.629,000 --> 0:11:34,000
the nicotine from that puff gets up into the brain

232
0:11:34.86,000 --> 0:11:35,000
in less than 10 seconds.

233
0:11:37.252,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Less than 10 seconds.

234
0:11:39.3,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Up in the brain,

235
0:11:41.053,000 --> 0:11:43,000
there are these things called "nicotinic receptors."

236
0:11:44.929,000 --> 0:11:45,000
They're there ...

237
0:11:46.428,000 --> 0:11:47,000
waiting.

238
0:11:47.945,000 --> 0:11:5,000
They're waiting for, in the words of that Philip Morris document,

239
0:11:51.231,000 --> 0:11:53,000
the next "dose unit of nicotine."

240
0:11:55.252,000 --> 0:11:57,000
The smoker that you see outside,

241
0:11:57.942,000 --> 0:11:58,000
huddled with other smokers,

242
0:11:59.855,000 --> 0:12:,000
in the cold,

243
0:12:01.363,000 --> 0:12:02,000
in the wind,

244
0:12:02.649,000 --> 0:12:03,000
in the rain,

245
0:12:04.366,000 --> 0:12:06,000
is experiencing craving

246
0:12:06.644,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and may be experiencing the symptoms of withdrawal.

247
0:12:10.564,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Those symptoms of withdrawal are a chemical message

248
0:12:14.149,000 --> 0:12:16,000
that these receptors are sending to the body,

249
0:12:16.313,000 --> 0:12:17,000
saying, "Feed me!"

250
0:12:20.49,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And a product that can deliver the drug in less than 10 seconds

251
0:12:27.23,000 --> 0:12:31,000
turns out to be an incredibly efficient and incredibly addictive product.

252
0:12:33.379,000 --> 0:12:36,000
We've spoken to so many addiction treatment experts

253
0:12:36.49,000 --> 0:12:37,000
over the years.

254
0:12:38.053,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And the story I hear is the same over and over again:

255
0:12:41.383,000 --> 0:12:43,000
"Long after I was able to get somebody off of heroin

256
0:12:43.891,000 --> 0:12:45,000
or cocaine or crack cocaine,

257
0:12:46.629,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I can't get them to quit cigarettes."

258
0:12:49.145,000 --> 0:12:52,000
A large part of the explanation is the 10-second thing.

259
0:12:54.081,000 --> 0:12:57,000
FDA has it within its regulatory reach

260
0:12:57.859,000 --> 0:12:59,000
to use the tools of product regulation

261
0:13:00.257,000 --> 0:13:04,000
to render cigarettes as we know them minimally or nonaddictive.

262
0:13:06.03,000 --> 0:13:07,000
We're working on this.

263
0:13:08.046,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And this could have a profound impact at a population level

264
0:13:12.116,000 --> 0:13:13,000
from this one policy.

265
0:13:14.124,000 --> 0:13:16,000
We did dynamic population-level modeling a year ago,

266
0:13:16.611,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and we published the results in "The New England Journal."

267
0:13:19.369,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And because of the generational effect of this policy,

268
0:13:21.946,000 --> 0:13:22,000
which I'll explain in a minute,

269
0:13:23.461,000 --> 0:13:25,000
here's what we project out through the end of the century:

270
0:13:26.292,000 --> 0:13:27,000
more than 33 million people

271
0:13:27.998,000 --> 0:13:3,000
who would otherwise have gone on to become regular smokers won't,

272
0:13:31.704,000 --> 0:13:33,000
because the cigarette that they'll be experimenting with

273
0:13:34.369,000 --> 0:13:35,000
can't create or sustain addiction.

274
0:13:36.569,000 --> 0:13:39,000
This would drive the adult smoking rate down to less than one and a half percent.

275
0:13:41.45,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And these two things combined

276
0:13:44.107,000 --> 0:13:49,000
would result in the saving of more than eight million cigarette-related deaths

277
0:13:49.615,000 --> 0:13:51,000
that would otherwise have occurred

278
0:13:51.868,000 --> 0:13:53,000
from the generational impact of this.

279
0:13:53.915,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Now, why am I saying "generational"?

280
0:13:57.367,000 --> 0:13:58,000
It's about kids.

281
0:14:00.09,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Ninety percent of adult smokers started smoking when they were kids.

282
0:14:04.121,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Half of them became regular smokers

283
0:14:06.248,000 --> 0:14:09,000
before they were legally old enough to buy a pack of cigarettes.

284
0:14:10.287,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Half of them became regular smokers before they were 18 years old.

285
0:14:13.49,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Experimentation.

286
0:14:15.212,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Regular smoking.

287
0:14:16.728,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Addiction.

288
0:14:18.522,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Decades of smoking.

289
0:14:19.887,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And then the illness,

290
0:14:21.514,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and that's why we're talking about a product

291
0:14:23.685,000 --> 0:14:26,000
that will kill half of all long-term users prematurely later in life.

292
0:14:28.88,000 --> 0:14:31,000
The generational impact of this nicotine-reduction policy

293
0:14:32.21,000 --> 0:14:33,000
is profound.

294
0:14:34.817,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Those old industry documents had a word for young people.

295
0:14:38.323,000 --> 0:14:4,000
They were described as "the replacement smokers."

296
0:14:42.577,000 --> 0:14:44,000
The replacement smokers for addicted adult smokers

297
0:14:44.966,000 --> 0:14:45,000
who died or quit.

298
0:14:46.533,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Future generations of kids, especially teens,

299
0:14:50.327,000 --> 0:14:51,000
are going to engage in risky behavior.

300
0:14:52.319,000 --> 0:14:53,000
We can't stop that.

301
0:14:54.01,000 --> 0:14:58,000
But what if the only cigarette that they could get their hands on

302
0:14:58.035,000 --> 0:15:,000
could no longer create or sustain addiction?

303
0:15:00.839,000 --> 0:15:02,000
That's the public health return on investment

304
0:15:03.474,000 --> 0:15:05,000
at a population level over time.

305
0:15:07.132,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Haven't said anything about e-cigarettes.

306
0:15:09.521,000 --> 0:15:11,000
But I have to say something about e-cigarettes.

307
0:15:11.751,000 --> 0:15:12,000
(Laughter)

308
0:15:12.792,000 --> 0:15:14,000
We are dealing with an epidemic of kids' use of e-cigarettes.

309
0:15:15.688,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And what troubles us the most,

310
0:15:17.871,000 --> 0:15:21,000
in combination with the rising numbers when it comes to prevalence,

311
0:15:22.276,000 --> 0:15:23,000
is frequency.

312
0:15:23.704,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Not only are more kids using e-cigarettes,

313
0:15:26.057,000 --> 0:15:3,000
but more kids are using e-cigarettes 20 or more days in the past 30 days

314
0:15:30.161,000 --> 0:15:32,000
than at any time since e-cigarettes came onto the market.

315
0:15:32.962,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And at FDA, we're doing everything that we can

316
0:15:35.208,000 --> 0:15:36,000
using program and policy,

317
0:15:36.49,000 --> 0:15:37,000
first to get the word out to kids

318
0:15:38.133,000 --> 0:15:4,000
that this is not a harmless product

319
0:15:40.228,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and to make sure that kids aren't initiating and experimenting

320
0:15:43.187,000 --> 0:15:44,000
on any tobacco product,

321
0:15:44.371,000 --> 0:15:45,000
whether combustion is present or not.

322
0:15:46.569,000 --> 0:15:49,000
But think about e-cigarettes in a properly regulated marketplace

323
0:15:49.714,000 --> 0:15:5,000
as something that could be of benefit

324
0:15:51.661,000 --> 0:15:53,000
to addicted adult cigarette smokers

325
0:15:53.805,000 --> 0:15:55,000
who are trying to transition away from cigarettes.

326
0:15:56.185,000 --> 0:15:59,000
So, I'll leave you with this vision:

327
0:16:01.748,000 --> 0:16:02,000
imagine a world

328
0:16:04.077,000 --> 0:16:06,000
where the only cigarette that future generations of kids

329
0:16:06.773,000 --> 0:16:07,000
could experiment with

330
0:16:07.958,000 --> 0:16:09,000
could no longer create or sustain addiction

331
0:16:10.22,000 --> 0:16:11,000
because of a single policy.

332
0:16:12.585,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Imagine a world

333
0:16:14.534,000 --> 0:16:16,000
where health-concerned cigarette smokers,

334
0:16:17.244,000 --> 0:16:19,000
especially if a policy goes into effect

335
0:16:20.164,000 --> 0:16:23,000
that takes the nicotine levels down to minimally or nonaddictive levels,

336
0:16:23.792,000 --> 0:16:25,000
could transition to alternative and less harmful forms

337
0:16:26.358,000 --> 0:16:27,000
of nicotine delivery,

338
0:16:27.697,000 --> 0:16:29,000
starting with FDA-approved nicotine medications,

339
0:16:29.974,000 --> 0:16:3,000
like the gum, patch and lozenge.

340
0:16:32.704,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And finally,

341
0:16:33.919,000 --> 0:16:35,000
imagine a world and a properly regulated marketplace,

342
0:16:36.792,000 --> 0:16:39,000
whether it's e-cigarettes or whatever the technology of the day,

343
0:16:40.03,000 --> 0:16:42,000
it's not the product developers and the marketers

344
0:16:42.355,000 --> 0:16:43,000
who decide which products come to market

345
0:16:44.324,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and what claims get made for them,

346
0:16:46.157,000 --> 0:16:48,000
it's review scientists at FDA,

347
0:16:49.053,000 --> 0:16:5,000
who look at applications

348
0:16:50.657,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and decide, using the standard that Congress has entrusted us

349
0:16:54.355,000 --> 0:16:56,000
to implement and enforce,

350
0:16:56.434,000 --> 0:16:58,000
whether a particular product should come to market,

351
0:16:59.291,000 --> 0:17:02,000
because the marketing of that product and the words of our law

352
0:17:02.553,000 --> 0:17:05,000
would be appropriate for the protection of the public health.

353
0:17:06.297,000 --> 0:17:08,000
These are the kinds of powerful regulatory tools

354
0:17:08.626,000 --> 0:17:1,000
that are within our reach

355
0:17:11.638,000 --> 0:17:12,000
to deal with what remains

356
0:17:13.038,000 --> 0:17:16,000
the leading cause of completely preventable disease and death

357
0:17:16.315,000 --> 0:17:17,000
in the country.

358
0:17:17.498,000 --> 0:17:18,000
If we get this right,

359
0:17:19.657,000 --> 0:17:23,000
that trajectory, those 5.6 million kids,

360
0:17:24.27,000 --> 0:17:25,000
is breakable.

361
0:17:25.635,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Thank you.

362
0:17:26.81,000 --> 0:17:28,000
(Applause)

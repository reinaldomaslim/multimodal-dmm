1
0:00:12.8,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I've been doing some thinking.

2
0:00:16.24,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm going to kill my dad.

3
0:00:19.2,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I called my sister.

4
0:00:20.44,000 --> 0:00:21,000
"Listen,

5
0:00:21.96,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I've been doing some thinking.

6
0:00:24.48,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I'm going to kill Dad.

7
0:00:27.48,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I'm going to take him to Oregon,

8
0:00:30.08,000 --> 0:00:31,000
find some heroin,

9
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and give it to him."

10
0:00:34.72,000 --> 0:00:36,000
My dad has frontotemporal lobe dementia,

11
0:00:36.88,000 --> 0:00:37,000
or FTD.

12
0:00:38.64,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It's a confusing disease that hits people in their 50s or 60s.

13
0:00:41.6,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It can completely change someone's personality,

14
0:00:44.52,000 --> 0:00:46,000
making them paranoid and even violent.

15
0:00:47.4,000 --> 0:00:48,000
My dad's been sick for a decade,

16
0:00:49.36,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but three years ago he got really sick,

17
0:00:51.92,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and we had to move him out of his house --

18
0:00:54.28,000 --> 0:00:55,000
the house that I grew up in,

19
0:00:56.24,000 --> 0:00:58,000
the house that he built with his own hands.

20
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
My strapping, cool dad with the falsetto singing voice

21
0:01:04.4,000 --> 0:01:06,000
had to move into a facility for round-the-clock care

22
0:01:06.853,000 --> 0:01:07,000
when he was just 65.

23
0:01:10.96,000 --> 0:01:12,000
At first my mom and sisters and I made the mistake

24
0:01:13.64,000 --> 0:01:15,000
of putting him in a regular nursing home.

25
0:01:16.599,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It was really pretty;

26
0:01:17.88,000 --> 0:01:19,000
it had plush carpet and afternoon art classes

27
0:01:20.84,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and a dog named Diane.

28
0:01:23.52,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But then I got a phone call.

29
0:01:26.52,000 --> 0:01:29,000
"Ms. Malone, we've arrested your father."

30
0:01:30.8,000 --> 0:01:31,000
"What?"

31
0:01:32.76,000 --> 0:01:35,000
"Well, he threatened everybody with cutlery.

32
0:01:36.96,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And then he yanked the curtains off the wall,

33
0:01:39.12,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and then he tried to throw plants out the window.

34
0:01:42.28,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And then, well, he pulled all the old ladies out of their wheelchairs."

35
0:01:49.2,000 --> 0:01:5,000
"All the old ladies?"

36
0:01:50.6,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

37
0:01:51.8,000 --> 0:01:52,000
"What a cowboy."

38
0:01:53.08,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

39
0:01:54.76,000 --> 0:01:55,000
After he got kicked out of there,

40
0:01:56.4,000 --> 0:01:58,000
we bounced him between a bunch of state-run facilities

41
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:03,000
before finding a treatment center specifically for people with dementia.

42
0:02:03.28,000 --> 0:02:05,000
At first, he kind of liked it,

43
0:02:05.36,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but over time his health declined,

44
0:02:07.32,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and one day I walked in

45
0:02:08.6,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and found him sitting hunched over on the ground wearing a onesie --

46
0:02:12.84,000 --> 0:02:14,000
those kinds of outfits that zip in the back.

47
0:02:17.76,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I watched him for about an hour as he yanked at it,

48
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:23,000
trying to find a way out of this thing.

49
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And it's supposed to be practical,

50
0:02:26.88,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but to me it looked like a straightjacket.

51
0:02:29.76,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And so I ran out.

52
0:02:32.52,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I left him there.

53
0:02:35.44,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I sat in my truck -- his old truck --

54
0:02:37.72,000 --> 0:02:38,000
hunched over,

55
0:02:39.36,000 --> 0:02:42,000
this really deep guttural cry coming out of the pit of my belly.

56
0:02:43.48,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I just couldn't believe that my father,

57
0:02:47.88,000 --> 0:02:48,000
the Adonis of my youth,

58
0:02:50.96,000 --> 0:02:51,000
my really dear friend,

59
0:02:53.64,000 --> 0:02:55,000
would think that this kind of life was worth living anymore.

60
0:02:58.52,000 --> 0:03:,000
We're programmed to prioritize productivity.

61
0:03:02.72,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So when a person -- an Adonis in this case --

62
0:03:06.08,000 --> 0:03:09,000
is no longer productive in the way we expect him to be,

63
0:03:09.76,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the way that he expects himself to be,

64
0:03:12.6,000 --> 0:03:14,000
what value does that life have left?

65
0:03:15.64,000 --> 0:03:16,000
That day in the truck,

66
0:03:17.52,000 --> 0:03:21,000
all I could imagine was that my dad was being tortured

67
0:03:21.72,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and his body was the vessel of that torture.

68
0:03:26.04,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I've got to get him out of that body.

69
0:03:28.6,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I've got to get him out of that body; I'm going to kill Dad.

70
0:03:32.6,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I call my sister.

71
0:03:35.4,000 --> 0:03:36,000
"Beth," she said.

72
0:03:40.8,000 --> 0:03:42,000
"You don't want to live the rest of your life

73
0:03:42.96,000 --> 0:03:43,000
knowing that you killed your father.

74
0:03:44.8,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And you'd be arrested I think,

75
0:03:46.92,000 --> 0:03:47,000
because he can't condone it.

76
0:03:48.52,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And you don't even know how to buy heroin."

77
0:03:50.8,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:51.84,000 --> 0:03:52,000
It's true, I don't.

79
0:03:53.12,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:56.2,000 --> 0:03:58,000
The truth is we talk about his death a lot.

81
0:03:58.28,000 --> 0:04:,000
When will it happen? What will it be like?

82
0:04:00.304,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But I wish that we would have talked about death when we were all healthy.

83
0:04:04.4,000 --> 0:04:06,000
What does my best death look like?

84
0:04:07.88,000 --> 0:04:09,000
What does your best death look like?

85
0:04:10.84,000 --> 0:04:12,000
But my family didn't know to do that.

86
0:04:13.68,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And my sister was right.

87
0:04:15.8,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I shouldn't murder Dad with heroin,

88
0:04:18.8,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but I've got to get him out of that body.

89
0:04:22.56,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So I went to a psychic.

90
0:04:24.76,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And then a priest, and then a support group,

91
0:04:26.88,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and they all said the same thing:

92
0:04:28.519,000 --> 0:04:31,000
sometimes people hang on when they're worried about loved ones.

93
0:04:31.64,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Just tell them you're safe, and it's OK to go when you're ready.

94
0:04:35.6,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So I went to see Dad.

95
0:04:37.84,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I found him hunched over on the ground in the onesie.

96
0:04:40.36,000 --> 0:04:43,000
He was staring past me and just kind of looking at the ground.

97
0:04:43.4,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I gave him a ginger ale

98
0:04:44.68,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and just started talking about nothing in particular,

99
0:04:47.32,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but as I was talking, he sneezed from the ginger ale.

100
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And the sneeze -- it jerked his body upright,

101
0:04:55.64,000 --> 0:04:56,000
sparking him back to life a little bit.

102
0:04:57.6,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And he just kept drinking and sneezing and sparking, over and over and over again

103
0:05:02.8,000 --> 0:05:03,000
until it stopped.

104
0:05:05.28,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And I heard,

105
0:05:07.44,000 --> 0:05:08,000
"Heheheheheh,

106
0:05:09.32,000 --> 0:05:11,000
heheheheheh ...

107
0:05:12.08,000 --> 0:05:14,000
this is so fabulous.

108
0:05:15.76,000 --> 0:05:17,000
This is so fabulous."

109
0:05:18.48,000 --> 0:05:2,000
His eyes were open and he was looking at me,

110
0:05:21.32,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and I said, "Hi, Dad!"

111
0:05:23.2,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and he said, "Hiya, Beth."

112
0:05:27.48,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And I opened my mouth to tell him, right?

113
0:05:29.48,000 --> 0:05:31,000
"Dad, if you want to die, you can die.

114
0:05:32.08,000 --> 0:05:33,000
We're all OK."

115
0:05:33.96,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But as I opened my mouth to tell him,

116
0:05:35.8,000 --> 0:05:36,000
all I could say was, "Dad!

117
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I miss you."

118
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And then he said, "Well, I miss you, too."

119
0:05:44.92,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And then I just fell over because I'm just a mess.

120
0:05:47.64,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So I fell over and I sat there with him

121
0:05:52.68,000 --> 0:05:54,000
because for the first time in a long time he seemed kind of OK.

122
0:05:56.84,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And I memorized his hands,

123
0:05:59.52,000 --> 0:06:03,000
feeling so grateful that his spirit was still attached to his body.

124
0:06:05.4,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And in that moment I realized

125
0:06:08.12,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I'm not responsible for this person.

126
0:06:11.56,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I'm not his doctor,

127
0:06:13.08,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I'm not his mother,

128
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I'm certainly not his God,

129
0:06:17.52,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and maybe the best way to help him and me

130
0:06:21.28,000 --> 0:06:23,000
is to resume our roles as father and daughter.

131
0:06:25.36,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And so we just sat there,

132
0:06:27.44,000 --> 0:06:29,000
calm and quiet like we've always done.

133
0:06:30.04,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Nobody was productive.

134
0:06:32.8,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Both of us are still strong.

135
0:06:37.24,000 --> 0:06:4,000
"OK, Dad. I'm going to go,

136
0:06:40.32,000 --> 0:06:41,000
but I'll see you tomorrow."

137
0:06:43.36,000 --> 0:06:44,000
"OK," he said.

138
0:06:46.88,000 --> 0:06:47,000
"Hey,

139
0:06:48.92,000 --> 0:06:49,000
this is a pretty nice hacienda."

140
0:06:51.96,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Thank you.

141
0:06:53.2,000 --> 0:06:57,000
(Applause)

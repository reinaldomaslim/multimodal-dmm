2
0:00:12.605,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Growth is not dead.

3
0:00:14.877,000 --> 0:00:15,000
(Applause)

4
0:00:16.263,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Let's start the story 120 years ago,

5
0:00:20.226,000 --> 0:00:23,000
when American factories began to electrify their operations,

6
0:00:23.858,000 --> 0:00:26,000
igniting the Second Industrial Revolution.

7
0:00:27.202,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The amazing thing is

8
0:00:28.313,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that productivity did not increase in those factories

9
0:00:31.09,000 --> 0:00:34,000
for 30 years. Thirty years.

10
0:00:34.346,000 --> 0:00:37,000
That's long enough for a generation of managers to retire.

11
0:00:37.82,000 --> 0:00:39,000
You see, the first wave of managers

12
0:00:40.042,000 --> 0:00:43,000
simply replaced their steam engines with electric motors,

13
0:00:43.459,000 --> 0:00:46,000
but they didn't redesign the factories to take advantage

14
0:00:46.469,000 --> 0:00:48,000
of electricity's flexibility.

15
0:00:48.81,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It fell to the next generation to invent new work processes,

16
0:00:52.794,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and then productivity soared,

17
0:00:55.521,000 --> 0:00:58,000
often doubling or even tripling in those factories.

18
0:00:59.186,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Electricity is an example of a general purpose technology,

19
0:01:03.909,000 --> 0:01:05,000
like the steam engine before it.

20
0:01:06.139,000 --> 0:01:09,000
General purpose technologies drive most economic growth,

21
0:01:09.555,000 --> 0:01:12,000
because they unleash cascades of complementary innovations,

22
0:01:13.009,000 --> 0:01:16,000
like lightbulbs and, yes, factory redesign.

23
0:01:16.641,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Is there a general purpose technology of our era?

24
0:01:20.251,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Sure. It's the computer.

25
0:01:22.759,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But technology alone is not enough.

26
0:01:25.418,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Technology is not destiny.

27
0:01:28.184,000 --> 0:01:29,000
We shape our destiny,

28
0:01:29.764,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and just as the earlier generations of managers

29
0:01:32.28,000 --> 0:01:34,000
needed to redesign their factories,

30
0:01:34.578,000 --> 0:01:36,000
we're going to need to reinvent our organizations

31
0:01:36.807,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and even our whole economic system.

32
0:01:39.362,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We're not doing as well at that job as we should be.

33
0:01:42.964,000 --> 0:01:43,000
As we'll see in a moment,

34
0:01:44.194,000 --> 0:01:46,000
productivity is actually doing all right,

35
0:01:46.916,000 --> 0:01:49,000
but it has become decoupled from jobs,

36
0:01:50.778,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and the income of the typical worker is stagnating.

37
0:01:55.197,000 --> 0:01:57,000
These troubles are sometimes misdiagnosed

38
0:01:57.716,000 --> 0:02:,000
as the end of innovation,

39
0:02:01.428,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but they are actually the growing pains

40
0:02:03.557,000 --> 0:02:08,000
of what Andrew McAfee and I call the new machine age.

41
0:02:09.147,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Let's look at some data.

42
0:02:11.029,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So here's GDP per person in America.

43
0:02:13.931,000 --> 0:02:15,000
There's some bumps along the way, but the big story

44
0:02:16.697,000 --> 0:02:18,000
is you could practically fit a ruler to it.

45
0:02:19.412,000 --> 0:02:22,000
This is a log scale, so what looks like steady growth

46
0:02:22.688,000 --> 0:02:25,000
is actually an acceleration in real terms.

47
0:02:25.731,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And here's productivity.

48
0:02:27.891,000 --> 0:02:29,000
You can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid-'70s,

49
0:02:30.562,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but it matches up pretty well with the Second Industrial Revolution,

50
0:02:34.3,000 --> 0:02:36,000
when factories were learning how to electrify their operations.

51
0:02:36.991,000 --> 0:02:4,000
After a lag, productivity accelerated again.

52
0:02:41.12,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So maybe "history doesn't repeat itself,

53
0:02:43.691,000 --> 0:02:45,000
but sometimes it rhymes."

54
0:02:46.259,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Today, productivity is at an all-time high,

55
0:02:49.395,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and despite the Great Recession,

56
0:02:51.372,000 --> 0:02:55,000
it grew faster in the 2000s than it did in the 1990s,

57
0:02:55.624,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the roaring 1990s, and that was faster than the '70s or '80s.

58
0:02:59.76,000 --> 0:03:02,000
It's growing faster than it did during the Second Industrial Revolution.

59
0:03:03.434,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And that's just the United States.

60
0:03:05.177,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The global news is even better.

61
0:03:08.425,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Worldwide incomes have grown at a faster rate

62
0:03:10.785,000 --> 0:03:12,000
in the past decade than ever in history.

63
0:03:13.281,000 --> 0:03:18,000
If anything, all these numbers actually understate our progress,

64
0:03:18.332,000 --> 0:03:19,000
because the new machine age

65
0:03:20.244,000 --> 0:03:21,000
is more about knowledge creation

66
0:03:21.908,000 --> 0:03:23,000
than just physical production.

67
0:03:24.239,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It's mind not matter, brain not brawn,

68
0:03:27.177,000 --> 0:03:29,000
ideas not things.

69
0:03:29.239,000 --> 0:03:31,000
That creates a problem for standard metrics,

70
0:03:31.809,000 --> 0:03:34,000
because we're getting more and more stuff for free,

71
0:03:35.311,000 --> 0:03:37,000
like Wikipedia, Google, Skype,

72
0:03:37.952,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and if they post it on the web, even this TED Talk.

73
0:03:41.015,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Now getting stuff for free is a good thing, right?

74
0:03:44.318,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Sure, of course it is.

75
0:03:46.083,000 --> 0:03:49,000
But that's not how economists measure GDP.

76
0:03:49.951,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Zero price means zero weight in the GDP statistics.

77
0:03:55.543,000 --> 0:03:57,000
According to the numbers, the music industry

78
0:03:57.655,000 --> 0:04:,000
is half the size that it was 10 years ago,

79
0:04:00.655,000 --> 0:04:03,000
but I'm listening to more and better music than ever.

80
0:04:04.311,000 --> 0:04:06,000
You know, I bet you are too.

81
0:04:06.503,000 --> 0:04:08,000
In total, my research estimates

82
0:04:09.226,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that the GDP numbers miss over 300 billion dollars per year

83
0:04:13.98,000 --> 0:04:16,000
in free goods and services on the Internet.

84
0:04:17.326,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Now let's look to the future.

85
0:04:19.115,000 --> 0:04:21,000
There are some super smart people

86
0:04:21.378,000 --> 0:04:26,000
who are arguing that we've reached the end of growth,

87
0:04:26.397,000 --> 0:04:29,000
but to understand the future of growth,

88
0:04:29.955,000 --> 0:04:31,000
we need to make predictions

89
0:04:32.638,000 --> 0:04:35,000
about the underlying drivers of growth.

90
0:04:35.928,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I'm optimistic, because the new machine age

91
0:04:39.734,000 --> 0:04:44,000
is digital, exponential and combinatorial.

92
0:04:44.764,000 --> 0:04:46,000
When goods are digital, they can be replicated

93
0:04:47.028,000 --> 0:04:51,000
with perfect quality at nearly zero cost,

94
0:04:51.537,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and they can be delivered almost instantaneously.

95
0:04:55.555,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Welcome to the economics of abundance.

96
0:04:58.355,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But there's a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world.

97
0:05:02.045,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Measurement is the lifeblood of science and progress.

98
0:05:06.645,000 --> 0:05:08,000
In the age of big data,

99
0:05:08.793,000 --> 0:05:12,000
we can measure the world in ways we never could before.

100
0:05:13.079,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Secondly, the new machine age is exponential.

101
0:05:17.174,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Computers get better faster than anything else ever.

102
0:05:23.109,000 --> 0:05:26,000
A child's Playstation today is more powerful

103
0:05:26.677,000 --> 0:05:3,000
than a military supercomputer from 1996.

104
0:05:30.733,000 --> 0:05:33,000
But our brains are wired for a linear world.

105
0:05:33.94,000 --> 0:05:36,000
As a result, exponential trends take us by surprise.

106
0:05:37.828,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I used to teach my students that there are some things,

107
0:05:40.43,000 --> 0:05:41,000
you know, computers just aren't good at,

108
0:05:42.364,000 --> 0:05:44,000
like driving a car through traffic.

109
0:05:44.749,000 --> 0:05:46,000
(Laughter)

110
0:05:46.762,000 --> 0:05:49,000
That's right, here's Andy and me grinning like madmen

111
0:05:50.253,000 --> 0:05:52,000
because we just rode down Route 101

112
0:05:52.637,000 --> 0:05:55,000
in, yes, a driverless car.

113
0:05:56.306,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Thirdly, the new machine age is combinatorial.

114
0:05:58.889,000 --> 0:06:02,000
The stagnationist view is that ideas get used up,

115
0:06:02.937,000 --> 0:06:03,000
like low-hanging fruit,

116
0:06:04.793,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but the reality is that each innovation

117
0:06:07.956,000 --> 0:06:1,000
creates building blocks for even more innovations.

118
0:06:11.212,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Here's an example. In just a matter of a few weeks,

119
0:06:14.557,000 --> 0:06:16,000
an undergraduate student of mine

120
0:06:16.629,000 --> 0:06:2,000
built an app that ultimately reached 1.3 million users.

121
0:06:20.74,000 --> 0:06:21,000
He was able to do that so easily

122
0:06:22.439,000 --> 0:06:23,000
because he built it on top of Facebook,

123
0:06:24.266,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and Facebook was built on top of the web,

124
0:06:26.199,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and that was built on top of the Internet,

125
0:06:27.897,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and so on and so forth.

126
0:06:30.315,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Now individually, digital, exponential and combinatorial

127
0:06:35.08,000 --> 0:06:37,000
would each be game-changers.

128
0:06:37.43,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Put them together, and we're seeing a wave

129
0:06:39.62,000 --> 0:06:4,000
of astonishing breakthroughs,

130
0:06:41.013,000 --> 0:06:44,000
like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah

131
0:06:44.073,000 --> 0:06:46,000
or leap tall buildings in a single bound.

132
0:06:46.869,000 --> 0:06:48,000
You know, robots are even revolutionizing

133
0:06:49.101,000 --> 0:06:5,000
cat transportation.

134
0:06:50.93,000 --> 0:06:52,000
(Laughter)

135
0:06:53.2,000 --> 0:06:55,000
But perhaps the most important invention,

136
0:06:55.932,000 --> 0:07:,000
the most important invention is machine learning.

137
0:07:00.997,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Consider one project: IBM's Watson.

138
0:07:04.373,000 --> 0:07:05,000
These little dots here,

139
0:07:05.962,000 --> 0:07:09,000
those are all the champions on the quiz show "Jeopardy."

140
0:07:10.822,000 --> 0:07:12,000
At first, Watson wasn't very good,

141
0:07:13.366,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but it improved at a rate faster than any human could,

142
0:07:18.988,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and shortly after Dave Ferrucci showed this chart

143
0:07:21.675,000 --> 0:07:22,000
to my class at MIT,

144
0:07:23.327,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Watson beat the world "Jeopardy" champion.

145
0:07:26.869,000 --> 0:07:29,000
At age seven, Watson is still kind of in its childhood.

146
0:07:30.858,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Recently, its teachers let it surf the Internet unsupervised.

147
0:07:36.176,000 --> 0:07:41,000
The next day, it started answering questions with profanities.

148
0:07:42.122,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Damn. (Laughter)

149
0:07:44.396,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But you know, Watson is growing up fast.

150
0:07:46.676,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It's being tested for jobs in call centers, and it's getting them.

151
0:07:50.888,000 --> 0:07:53,000
It's applying for legal, banking and medical jobs,

152
0:07:54.612,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and getting some of them.

153
0:07:56.562,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Isn't it ironic that at the very moment

154
0:07:58.451,000 --> 0:08:,000
we are building intelligent machines,

155
0:08:00.685,000 --> 0:08:03,000
perhaps the most important invention in human history,

156
0:08:04.134,000 --> 0:08:07,000
some people are arguing that innovation is stagnating?

157
0:08:08.109,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Like the first two industrial revolutions,

158
0:08:10.528,000 --> 0:08:13,000
the full implications of the new machine age

159
0:08:13.662,000 --> 0:08:15,000
are going to take at least a century to fully play out,

160
0:08:16.344,000 --> 0:08:19,000
but they are staggering.

161
0:08:19.376,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So does that mean we have nothing to worry about?

162
0:08:22.712,000 --> 0:08:25,000
No. Technology is not destiny.

163
0:08:26.392,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Productivity is at an all time high,

164
0:08:28.961,000 --> 0:08:3,000
but fewer people now have jobs.

165
0:08:31.944,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We have created more wealth in the past decade than ever,

166
0:08:35.064,000 --> 0:08:38,000
but for a majority of Americans, their income has fallen.

167
0:08:38.968,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This is the great decoupling

168
0:08:41.28,000 --> 0:08:43,000
of productivity from employment,

169
0:08:44.256,000 --> 0:08:47,000
of wealth from work.

170
0:08:47.36,000 --> 0:08:49,000
You know, it's not surprising that millions of people

171
0:08:49.706,000 --> 0:08:51,000
have become disillusioned by the great decoupling,

172
0:08:52.552,000 --> 0:08:53,000
but like too many others,

173
0:08:54.299,000 --> 0:08:57,000
they misunderstand its basic causes.

174
0:08:57.396,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Technology is racing ahead,

175
0:09:00.006,000 --> 0:09:03,000
but it's leaving more and more people behind.

176
0:09:03.556,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Today, we can take a routine job,

177
0:09:07.075,000 --> 0:09:1,000
codify it in a set of machine-readable instructions,

178
0:09:10.166,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and then replicate it a million times.

179
0:09:12.993,000 --> 0:09:14,000
You know, I recently overheard a conversation

180
0:09:15.272,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that epitomizes these new economics.

181
0:09:17.224,000 --> 0:09:21,000
This guy says, "Nah, I don't use H&R Block anymore.

182
0:09:21.421,000 --> 0:09:23,000
TurboTax does everything that my tax preparer did,

183
0:09:23.869,000 --> 0:09:27,000
but it's faster, cheaper and more accurate."

184
0:09:28.427,000 --> 0:09:29,000
How can a skilled worker

185
0:09:30.226,000 --> 0:09:33,000
compete with a $39 piece of software?

186
0:09:33.235,000 --> 0:09:34,000
She can't.

187
0:09:35.202,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Today, millions of Americans do have faster,

188
0:09:37.982,000 --> 0:09:39,000
cheaper, more accurate tax preparation,

189
0:09:40.369,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and the founders of Intuit

190
0:09:41.855,000 --> 0:09:43,000
have done very well for themselves.

191
0:09:44.348,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But 17 percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs.

192
0:09:48.562,000 --> 0:09:5,000
That is a microcosm of what's happening,

193
0:09:50.64,000 --> 0:09:54,000
not just in software and services, but in media and music,

194
0:09:55.317,000 --> 0:09:58,000
in finance and manufacturing, in retailing and trade --

195
0:09:59.003,000 --> 0:10:02,000
in short, in every industry.

196
0:10:02.898,000 --> 0:10:05,000
People are racing against the machine,

197
0:10:05.993,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and many of them are losing that race.

198
0:10:09.083,000 --> 0:10:12,000
What can we do to create shared prosperity?

199
0:10:12.969,000 --> 0:10:15,000
The answer is not to try to slow down technology.

200
0:10:15.986,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Instead of racing against the machine,

201
0:10:18.543,000 --> 0:10:21,000
we need to learn to race with the machine.

202
0:10:22.22,000 --> 0:10:25,000
That is our grand challenge.

203
0:10:25.349,000 --> 0:10:27,000
The new machine age

204
0:10:27.673,000 --> 0:10:3,000
can be dated to a day 15 years ago

205
0:10:30.786,000 --> 0:10:32,000
when Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion,

206
0:10:33.664,000 --> 0:10:36,000
played Deep Blue, a supercomputer.

207
0:10:37.37,000 --> 0:10:39,000
The machine won that day,

208
0:10:39.382,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and today, a chess program running on a cell phone

209
0:10:42.35,000 --> 0:10:44,000
can beat a human grandmaster.

210
0:10:44.646,000 --> 0:10:47,000
It got so bad that, when he was asked

211
0:10:48.011,000 --> 0:10:5,000
what strategy he would use against a computer,

212
0:10:50.574,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Jan Donner, the Dutch grandmaster, replied,

213
0:10:54.59,000 --> 0:10:55,000
"I'd bring a hammer."

214
0:10:56.361,000 --> 0:10:59,000
(Laughter)

215
0:11:00.041,000 --> 0:11:04,000
But today a computer is no longer the world chess champion.

216
0:11:04.585,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Neither is a human,

217
0:11:07.239,000 --> 0:11:1,000
because Kasparov organized a freestyle tournament

218
0:11:10.818,000 --> 0:11:11,000
where teams of humans and computers

219
0:11:12.734,000 --> 0:11:14,000
could work together,

220
0:11:14.833,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and the winning team had no grandmaster,

221
0:11:17.99,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and it had no supercomputer.

222
0:11:20.455,000 --> 0:11:24,000
What they had was better teamwork,

223
0:11:24.63,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and they showed that a team of humans and computers,

224
0:11:29.646,000 --> 0:11:32,000
working together, could beat any computer

225
0:11:32.694,000 --> 0:11:35,000
or any human working alone.

226
0:11:36.214,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Racing with the machine

227
0:11:37.878,000 --> 0:11:39,000
beats racing against the machine.

228
0:11:40.221,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Technology is not destiny.

229
0:11:42.785,000 --> 0:11:43,000
We shape our destiny.

230
0:11:44.527,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Thank you.

231
0:11:45.974,000 --> 0:11:5,000
(Applause)
